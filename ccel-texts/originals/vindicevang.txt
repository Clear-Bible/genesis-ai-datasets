Prefatory note.

   In 1654 the commands of the Council of State were laid upon Owen to
   undertake the refutation of Socinianism, which about that time was
   introduced into England, and in the following year the "Vindiciæ
   Evangelicæ" appeared; -- a work of unequal merit, and in many parts
   obsolete under the new light shed on the subject by more recent
   discussions, but in the main so solid as never to have been answered;
   containing much that modern polemics have by no means superseded; full
   of information as to the early history of Socinianism, nowhere else to
   be gleaned in the theological literature of Britain; and altogether of
   such substantial excellence as to render its author's name worthy of
   its place as historically the first among that splendid catena of
   divines, -- Bull, Waterland, Horsley, Magee, Fuller, Pye Smith, and
   Wardlaw, -- by whom the cardinal doctrines of Christ's person, Godhead,
   and work, have been placed on a basis of unshaken demonstration from
   the Word of God.

   In the execution of his task, our author resolved to meet three parties
   whose writings tended to unsettle the general belief of the Church of
   Christ respecting these doctrines; -- Biddle, whose publications,
   devoted to the propagation of Unitarian sentiments, had drawn the
   attention and excited the fears of the Council; the Polish Socinians,
   as represented by the Racovian Catechism; and Hugo Grotius, whose
   Socinianizing comments on Scripture have left his orthodoxy on the
   vital truths of our Lord's divinity and satisfaction under a cloud of
   suspicion.

   John Biddle, the father of English Socinianism, was born in 1616, at
   Wotton-under-Edge. Having made considerable proficiency at the grammar
   school of his native town, he received from Lord Berkeley an exhibition
   of £10, was admitted a student of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and took his
   degree of A.M. in 1641. While occupied afterwards as a teacher in the
   city of Gloucester, he began to divulge his errors by the private
   circulation of a small tract, under the title, "Twelve Arguments drawn
   out of the Scriptures, wherein the commonly received opinion touching
   the Deity of the Holy Spirit is fully Refuted." He was summoned from
   the county jail, to which the magistrates had committed him, to answer
   for his errors before Parliament; and, on the report of a committee
   respecting his case, he was left under the custody of an officer of the
   House for five years. During this period he published successively his
   "Twelve Arguments," "A Confession of Faith concerning the Holy
   Trinity," and "The Testimonies of Irenæus, etc., concerning one God and
   the Persons of the Holy Trinity." By an atrocious act passed in 1648,
   in which it was made a capital offence to publish against the being and
   perfections of God, the deity of the Son and of the Spirit, and similar
   doctrines, Biddle had well-nigh fallen a martyr to his opinions. The
   act, however, never came into operation. He was even in more serious
   peril after the Long Parliament was dissolved and its opponents were in
   power; for he actually stood a trial for his life in 1655. Cromwell
   dexterously overruled these proceedings by the summary banishment of
   Biddle to Star Castle, in one of the Scilly Islands. He recovered his
   freedom only to be cast into prison anew on the Restoration; and having
   caught some distemper common in the jails of that time, he died a
   prisoner in 1662. He was a man of considerable attainments as a
   scholar. "Except his opinions," says Anthony Wood, "there was little or
   nothing blameworthy in him;" and his admirer, Toulmin, pronounces him
   "a pious, holy, and humble man." His piety must have been of a singular
   type, if we consider his views of the divine nature, -- views replete
   with the most profane and revolting materialism, at that time without a
   parallel in our literature, and calculated to shock the best feelings
   and holiest convictions of his countrymen, while the knowledge of them
   inspired continental divines with alarm, as if England were fast
   lapsing into the most impious heresies. It can only be from a desire
   that their cause may have the honour of having stood, in one instance
   at least, the test of civil penalties under British rule, that
   Socinians, who pride themselves on their views of the spirituality of
   God, claim affinity with poor Biddle.

   Nicolas Estwick replied to him, in an "Examination of his Confession of
   Faith;" Poole, in his "Plea for the Godhead of the Holy Ghost;" and
   Francis Cheynel, in his "Divine Trinunity of the Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost." Biddle held to his errors, and produced in 1654 his "Twofold
   Catechism," etc.; which the following work of Owen is designed to
   review and confute.

   The Racovian Catechism derives its name from the Polish city of Rakau,
   the chief seat of the Polish Unitarians. According to Sandius (Bib.
   Antitrin. p. 44), the first Catechism of this name was the work of
   Gregory Paul; and when Faustus Socinus and Peter Statorius, junior,
   were prevented by death from completing their revision of it, according
   to an appointment laid upon them by their brethren of the same creed,
   the task was devolved on Valentine Smalcius, Jerome Moscorovius, and
   John Volkelius. The first part of this statement seems to want
   authentication, and the original of the Catechism has been traced to a
   confession of faith prepared by George Schomann. Remodelled by the
   committee mentioned above, it appeared in 1605, and was the first
   edition of the Racovian Catechism. It was translated into German in
   1608. A reprint of the original work in London attracted the notice of
   Parliament, and on the 2d of April 1652, the Sheriffs of London and of
   Middlesex were ordered to seize and burn all the copies of it at the
   London Exchange and at Palace Yard, Westminster. An English translation
   of it, prepared most probably by Biddle, issued from the Amsterdam
   press in 1652. The most correct and valuable edition of the Catechism,
   supplying the latest views of the old Socinian theology in Poland, is
   the quarto edition of 1680, printed at Amsterdam by Christopher Pezold.
   Modern Socinianism has added nothing to the plausibility with which the
   system is invested in this Catechism; and the refutation of its
   insidious principles by Owen was a service to the cause of scriptural
   truth, from which Christianity is yet reaping, and for generations will
   continue to reap, the highest benefit.

   Hugo Grotius is a name which reminds us of a sadly chequered history,
   diversified gifts of the highest order, and a strangely piebald and
   ambiguous creed. We need not allude to the well-known incidents of his
   eventful career, -- the high offices he held in his native country, his
   connection with the disputes between the Gomarists and the
   Remonstrants, the retribution under which he became the victim of that
   appeal to arms and force which his own party beyond all question had
   begun, his escape from prison through the ingenious device of his wife,
   his residence at Paris, and death at Rostock in 1645. He had published
   a work, "De Satisfactione Christi," designed to refute the errors of
   Socinianism, but towards the close of his life he prepared a series of
   annotations on Scripture, respecting which it was the charge of Owen
   that "he left but one place giving testimony clearly to the deity of
   Christ." Dr Hammond took him to task for misrepresenting the Dutch
   statesman. Owen, both in the "Vindiciæ Evangelicæ" and in his "Review
   of the Annotations," advances overwhelming evidence in support of his
   assertion. Whether we are to account it morbid candour or indifference
   to the great truths of the gospel, Grotius assuredly emitted a most
   uncertain sound respecting them. He is claimed alike by Socinians,
   Arminians, and Papists. The learned Jesuit Petavius said prayers for
   the repose of his soul; and Bossuet considered him so near the truth
   that "it was wonderful he did not take the last step," -- that is,
   connect himself with the Church of Rome, -- while he affirms, at the
   same time, that "he stole from the Church her most powerful proofs of
   the divinity of Christ." Menâge wrote a witty epigram, to the effect
   that as many sects claimed the religion of Grotius as towns contended
   for the honour of being the birth-place of Homer. Who would not wish to
   rank among the abettors of his own tenets a statesman of such vast
   attainments and versatile ability? It is enough, however, to make us
   sympathize with Owen, who only followed the example of all the
   Protestant divines of Charenton, in repudiating fellowship with
   Grotius, when we peruse the epistles of the latter to the Socinian
   Crellius. See page 638. Is the difference between those who hold and
   those who deny the Godhead of Christ to be made matter of contemptuous
   aposiopesis, and to be spoken of as "quantilla causa?" -- Ed.

To the right worshipful, his reverend, learned, and worthy friends and brethren,
the heads and governors of the colleges and halls, with all other students in
divinity, or of the truth which is after godliness, in the famous University of
Oxford.

   Of this second address unto you in this kind, whereunto I am encouraged
   by your fair and candid reception of my former, I desire you would be
   pleased to take the ensuing account. It is now, as I remember, about a
   year ago since one Mr Biddle (formerly a master of arts of this
   university, by which title he still owns himself) published two little
   Catechisms, as he calls them, wherein, under sundry specious pleas and
   pretences, which you will find discussed in the ensuing treatise, he
   endeavours to insinuate subtilely into the minds of unstable and
   unlearned men the whole substance of the Socinian religion. The man is
   a person whom, to my knowledge, I never saw, nor have been at all
   curious to inquire after the place of his habitation or course of his
   life. His opposition some years since to the deity of the Holy Ghost,
   and now to that of the Father and Son also, is all that he is known to
   me by. It is not with his person that I have any contest; he stands or
   falls to his own master. His arguments against the deity of the Holy
   Ghost were some while since answered by Cloppenburgh, then professor of
   divinity at Franeker, in Friesland, since at rest in the Lord; and, as
   I have heard, by one in English. His Catechisms also are gone over the
   seas; whereof farther mention must afterward be made. At their first
   publishing, complaint being given in by some worthy persons to the
   Honourable Council against them, as abusive to the majesty and
   authority of the word of God, and destructive to many important truths
   of the gospel (which was done without any knowledge of mine), they were
   pleased to send for me, and to require of me the performance of that
   work which is here presented unto you. Being surprised with their
   request, I laboured to excuse myself to the utmost, on the account of
   my many employments in the university and elsewhere, with other reasons
   of the like nature, which to my thoughts did then occur. [Not
   prevailing with them, they persisting in their command, I looked on it
   as a call from God to plead for his violated truth; which, by his
   assistance, and according as I had opportunity, I was in general alway
   resolved to do. Having, indeed, but newly taken off my hand from the
   plough of a peculiar controversy about the perseverance of the saints,
   in the following whereof I was somewhat tired, the entrance into the
   work was irksome and burdensome unto me. After some progress made,
   finding the searching into and discussing of the important truths
   opposed of very good use to myself, I have been carried through the
   whole (according as I could break off my daily pressing occasions to
   attend unto it) with much cheerfulness and alacrity of mind. And this
   was the reason why, finding Mr Biddle came short of giving a fair
   occasion to the full vindication of many heads of religion by him
   oppugned, I have called in to his assistance and society one of his
   great masters, namely, Valentinus Smalcius, and his Catechism (commonly
   called the Racovian), with the expositions of the places of Scripture
   contended about by the learned Grotius, as also, on several occasions,
   the arguments and answers of most of the chief propugners of Mr
   Biddle's religion. Now, besides your interest in the truths pleaded
   for, there are other considerations also inducing me to a persuasion
   that this endeavour of mine will not be unacceptable unto you. Mr
   Biddle's Catechisms, as I said, being carried over and dispersed in
   sundry places of the United Provinces, the professors of their
   academies (who have all generally learned the English tongue, to enable
   them for the understanding of the treatises of divinity in all kinds
   written therein, which they begin to make use of to the purpose) cry
   out against them, and professedly undertake the refutation thereof.
   Now, certainly it cannot be for our advantage in point of repute
   amongst them, that they (who are yet glad of the occasion) should be
   enforced to undertake the confutation of a book written by one who
   styles himself a master of arts of this university (which they also
   take notice of), wherein they are so little concerned, the poison of it
   being shut up from their people under the safe custody of an unknown
   tongue. Nicolaus Arnoldus, the professor of divinity at Franeker, gives
   an account of this book, as the most subtile insinuation of the
   Socinian religion that ever was attempted, and promises a confutation
   of it.

   Maresius, professor at Groningen, a man well known by his works
   published, goes farther, and, on the account of these Catechisms,
   charges the whole nation and the governors of it with Socinianism; and,
   according to the manner of the man, raises a fearful outcry, affirming
   that that heresy hath fixed its metropolitical seat here in England,
   and is here openly professed, as the head sect in the nation,
   displaying openly the banners of its iniquity: all which he confirms by
   instancing in this book of a master of arts of the university of
   Oxford. [1] Of his rashness in censuring, and his extreme ignorance of
   the state of affairs here amongst us, which yet he undertakes to
   relate, judge, and condemn, I have given him an account, in a private
   letter to himself.

   Certainly, though we deserved to have these reproaches cast upon us,
   yet of all men in the world those who live under the protection and
   upon the allowance of the United Provinces are most unmeet to manage
   them; their incompetency in sundry respects for this service is known
   to all. However, it cannot be denied but that, even on this account
   (that it may appear that we are, as free from the guilt of the
   calumnious insinuations of Maresius, so in no need of the assistance of
   Arnoldus for the confutation of any one arising among ourselves
   speaking perverse things to draw disciples after him), an answer from
   some in this place unto those Catechisms was sufficiently necessary.
   That it is by Providence fallen upon the hand of one more unmeet than
   many others in this place for the performance of this work and duty, I
   doubt not but you will be contented withal; and I am bold to hope that
   neither the truth nor your own esteem will too much suffer by my
   engagement herein. Yea (give me leave to speak it), I have assumed the
   confidence to aim at the handling of the whole body of the Socinian
   religion, in such a way and manner as that those who are most knowing
   and exercised in these controversies may find that which they will not
   altogether despise, and younger students that whereby they may profit.
   To this end I have added the Racovian Catechism, as I said before, to
   Mr Biddle's; which as I was urged to do by many worthy persons in this
   university, so I was no way discouraged in the publishing of my answer
   thereunto by the view I took of Arnoldus' discourse to the same
   purpose, and that for such reasons as I shall not express, but leave
   the whole to the judgment of the reader.

   From thence whence in the thoughts of some I am most likely to suffer,
   as to my own resolves, I am most secure. It is in meddling with
   Grotius' Annotations, and calling into question what hath been
   delivered by such a giant in all kinds of literature. Since my
   engagement in this business, and when I had well-nigh finished the
   vindication of the texts of Scripture commonly pleaded for the
   demonstration of the deity of Christ from the exceptions put in to
   their testimonies by the Racovian Catechism, I had the sight of Dr
   Hammond's apology for him, in his vindication of his dissertations
   about episcopacy from my occasional animadversions, published in the
   preface of my book of the Perseverance of the Saints. Of that whole
   treatise I shall elsewhere give an account. My defensative, as to my
   dealing with Grotius' Annotations, is suited to what the doctor pleads
   in his behalf, which occasions this mention thereof:--

   "This very pious, learned, judicious man," he tells us, "hath fallen
   under some harsh censures of late, especially upon the account of
   Socinianism and Popery." That is, not as though he would reconcile
   these extremes, but being in doctrinals a Socinian, he yet closed in
   many things with the Roman interest; as I no way doubt but thousands of
   the same persuasion with the Socinians as to the person and offices of
   Christ do live in the outward communion of that church (as they call
   it) to this day; of which supposal I am not without considerable
   grounds and eminent instances for its confirmation. This, I say, is
   their charge upon him. For his being a Socinian, he tells us, "Three
   things are made use of to beget a jealousy in the minds of men of his
   inclinations that way:-- 1. Some parcels of a letter of his to
   Crellius; 2. Some relations of what passed from him at his death; 3.
   Some passages in his Annotations." It is this last alone wherein I am
   concerned; and what I have to speak to them, I desire may be measured
   and weighed by what I do premise. It is not that I do entertain in
   myself any hard thoughts, or that I would beget in others any evil
   surmises, of the eternal condition of that man that I speak what I do.
   What am I that I should judge another man's servant? He is fallen to
   his own master. I am very slow to judge of men's acceptation with God
   by the apprehension of their understandings. This only I know, that be
   men of what religion soever that is professed in the world, if they are
   drunkards, proud, boasters, etc., hypocrites, haters of good men,
   persecutors and revilers of them, yea, if they be not regenerate and
   born of God, united to the head, Christ Jesus, by the same Spirit that
   is in him, they shall never see God.

   But for the passages in his Annotations, the substance of the doctor's
   plea is, "That the passages intimated are in his posthuma; that he
   intended not to publish them; that they might be of things he observed,
   but thought farther to consider;" and an instance is given in that of
   Col. i. 16, which he interprets contrary to what he urged it for, John
   i. 1-3. But granting what is affirmed as to matter of fact about his
   Collections (though the preface to the last part of his Annotations
   will not allow it to be true [2] ), I must needs abide in my
   dissatisfaction as to these Annotations, and of my resolves in these
   thoughts give the doctor this account. Of the Socinian religion there
   are two main parts; the first is Photinianism, the latter Pelagianism,
   -- the first concerning the person, the other the grace of Christ. Let
   us take an eminent instance out of either of these heads: out of the
   first, their denying Christ to be God by nature; out of the latter,
   their denial of his satisfaction.

   For the first, I must needs tell the apologist, that of all the texts
   of the New Testament, and Old, whereby the deity of Christ is usually
   confirmed, and where it is evidently testified unto, he hath not left
   any more than one, that I have observed, if one, speaking any thing
   clearly to that purpose. I say, if one, for that he speaks not home to
   the business in hand on John i. I shall elsewhere give an account;
   perhaps some one or two more may be interpreted according to the
   analogy of that. I speak not of his Annotations on the Epistles, but on
   the whole Bible throughout, wherein his expositions given do, for the
   most part, fall in with those of the Socinians, and oftentimes consist
   in the very words of Socinus and Smalcius, and alway do the same things
   with them, as to any notice of the deity of Christ in them. So that I
   marvel the learned doctor should fix upon one particular instance, as
   though that one place alone were corrupted by him, when there is not
   one (or but one) that is not wrested, perverted, and corrupted, to the
   same purpose. For the full conviction of the truth hereof, I refer the
   reader to the ensuing considerations of his interpretations of the
   places themselves. The condition of these famous Annotations as to the
   satisfaction of Christ is the same. Not one text of the whole
   Scripture, wherein testimony is given to that sacred truth, which is
   not wrested to another sense, or at least the doctrine in it concealed
   and obscured by them. I do not speak this with the least intention to
   cast upon him the reproach of a Socinian; I judge not his person. His
   books are published to be considered and judged. Erasmus, I know, made
   way for him in most of his expositions about the deity of Christ; but
   what repute he hath thereby obtained among all that honour the eternal
   Godhead of the Son of God, let Bellarmine, on the one hand, and Beza,
   on the other, evince. And as I will by no means maintain or urge
   against Grotius any of the miscarriages in religion which the answerer
   of my animadversions undertakes to vindicate him from, nor do I desire
   to fight with the dust and ashes of men; yet what I have said is, if
   not necessary to return to the apologist, yet of tendency, I hope, to
   the satisfaction of others, who may inquire after the reason of my
   calling the Annotations of the learned man to an account in this
   discourse. Shall any one take liberty to pluck down the pillars of our
   faith, and weaken the grounds of our assurance concerning the person
   and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and shall not we have the boldness
   to call him to an account for so sacrilegious an attempt? With those,
   then, who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, I expect no blame or
   reproach for what I have endeavoured in this kind; yea, that my good
   will shall find acceptance with them, especially if it shall occasion
   any of greater leisure and abilities farther and professedly to remark
   more of the corruptions of those Annotations, I have good ground of
   expectation. The truth is, notwithstanding their pompous show and
   appearance -- few of his quotations (which was the manner of the man)
   being at all to his purpose [3] , -- it will be found no difficult
   matter to discuss his assertions and dissipate his conjectures.

   For his being a Papist, I have not much to say. Let his epistles
   (published by his friends) written to Dionysius Petavius the Jesuit be
   perused, and you will see the character which of himself he gives, [4]
   as also what in sundry writings he ascribes to the pope.

   What I have performed, through the good hand of God in the whole, is
   humbly submitted to your judgment. You know, all of you, with what
   weight of business and employment I am pressed, what is the constant
   work that in this place is incumbent on me, how many and how urgent my
   avocations are; the consideration whereof cannot but prevail for a
   pardon of that want of exactness which perhaps in sundry particulars
   will appear unto you. With those who are neither willing nor able to do
   any thing in this kind themselves, and yet make it their business to
   despise what is done by others, I shall very little trouble myself.
   That which seems, in relation hereunto, to call for an apology, is my
   engagement into this work, wherein I was not particularly concerned,
   suffering in the meantime some treatises against me to lie unanswered.
   Dr Hammond's answer to my animadversions on his dissertations about
   episcopacy, Mr Baxter's objections against somewhat written about the
   death of Christ, and a book of one Mr Horne against my treatise about
   universal redemption, are all the instances that I know of which in
   this kind may be given. To all that candidly take notice of these
   things, my defence is at hand. I do not know that I am more obliged to
   answer a treatise written against, myself than any other written
   against the truth, though I am not particularly named or opposed
   therein; nor do I intend to put any such law of disquietness upon my
   spirit as to think myself bound to reply to every thing that is written
   against me, whether the matter and subject of it be worth the public
   ventilation or no. It is neither name nor repute that I eye in these
   contests: so the truth be safe, I can be well content to suffer.
   Besides, this present task was not voluntarily undertaken by me; it
   was, as I have already given account, imposed on me by such an
   authority as I could not waive. For Mr Horne's book, I suppose you are
   not acquainted with it; that alone was extant before my last
   engagement. Could I have met with any one uninterested person that
   would have said it deserved a reply, it had not have lain so long
   unanswered. In the meantime, I cannot but rejoice that some,
   like-minded with him, cannot impute my silence to the weakness of the
   cause I managed, but to my incompetency for the work of maintaining it.
   To Mr Baxter, as far as I am concerned, I have made a return in the
   close of this treatise; wherein I suppose I have put an end to that
   controversy. Dr Hammond's defensative came forth much about the time
   that half this treatise was finished, and being about a matter of so
   mean concernment, in comparison of those weighty truths of the gospel
   which I was engaged in the defence of, I durst not desert my station to
   turn aside thereto. On the cursory view I have taken of it, I look upon
   what is of real difference between that learned person and myself to be
   a matter of easy despatch. His leaves are much more soft and gentle
   than those of Socinus, Smalcius, Crellius, and Schlichtingius. If the
   Lord in his goodness be pleased to give me a little respite and
   leisure, I shall give a farther account of the whole difference between
   the learned doctor and me, in such a way of process as may be expected
   from so slow and dull a person as I am. In the meantime, I wish him a
   better cause to manage than that wherein against me he is engaged, and
   better principles to manage a good cause on than some of those in his
   treatise of schism, and some others. Fail he not in these, his
   abilities and diligence will stand him in very good stead. I shall not
   trouble you with things which I have advantages other ways to impart my
   thoughts concerning; I only crave that you would be pleased candidly to
   accept of this testimony of my respects to you, and, seeing no other
   things are in the ensuing treatise pleaded for but such as are
   universally owned amongst you, that, according to your several degrees,
   you would take it into your patronage or use, affording him in his
   daily labours the benefit of your prayers at the throne of grace, who
   is your unworthy fellow-labourer,

The preface to the reader.

   To those that labour in the word and doctrine in these nations of
   England, Scotland, and Ireland, with all that call upon the name of
   Jesus Christ our Lord, John Owen wisheth grace and peace from God our
   Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

   That so mean a person as I am should presume in this public manner to
   make address to all those comprised in the title of this epistle, I
   desire it may be ascribed to the business I come about and the message
   that I bring. It is about your great interest and concermnent, your
   whole portion and inheritance, your all, that I am to deal with you. If
   he who passes by his neighbour's house, seeing a thief breaking up its
   foundations or setting fire to its chief materials, will be far from
   being censured as importune and impudent if he awake and call upon the
   inhabitants, though every way his betters (especially if all his own
   estate lie therein also), although he be not able to carry one vessel
   of water to the quenching of it, I hope that, finding persons
   endeavouring to put fire to the house of God, which house ye are, and
   labouring to steal away the whole treasure thereof, wherein also my own
   portion doth lie, I shall not be condemned of boldness or presumption
   if I at once cry out to all persons, however concerned, to take heed
   that we be not utterly despoiled of our treasure, though when I have so
   done, I be not able to give the least assistance to the defence of the
   house or quenching of the fire kindled about it. That of no less
   importance is this address unto you, a brief discovery of its occasion
   will evince.

   The Holy Ghost tells us that we are "built upon the foundation of the
   apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
   corner-stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth
   unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom we are builded together for an
   habitation of God through the Spirit," Eph. ii. 20-22. And thus do all
   they become the house of Christ "who hold fast the confidence and the
   rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end," Heb. iii. 6. In this house of
   God there are daily builders, according as new living stones are to be
   fitted to their places therein; and continual oppositions have there
   been made thereto, and will be, "till we all come in the unity of the
   faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto
   the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ," Eph. iv. 13. In
   this work of building are some employed by Jesus Christ, and will be so
   to the end of the world, Matt. xxviii. 19, 20, Eph. iv. 11, 12; and
   some employ themselves at least in a pretence thereof, but are indeed,
   to a man, every one like the foolish woman that pulls down her house
   with both her hands. Of the first sort, "other foundation can no man
   lay," nor doth go about to lay, "than that is laid, which is Jesus
   Christ," 1 Cor. iii. 11; but some of them build on this foundation
   "gold, silver, and precious stones," keeping fast in the work to the
   form of "wholesome words," and contending for "the faith that was once
   delivered unto the saints."

   Others, again, lay on "wood, hay, and stubble," either contending about
   "foolish questions," or "vain and unprofitable janglings," or adding to
   what God hath commanded, or corrupting and perverting what he hath
   revealed and instituted, contrary to the proportion of faith, which
   should be the rule of all their prophecy, whereby they discharge their
   duty of building in this house. Those with whom I am at present to
   deal, and concerning whom I desire to tender you the ensuing account,
   are of the latter sort; such as, not content, with others, to attempt
   sundry parts of the building, to weaken its contexture, or deface its
   comeliness, do with all their might set themselves against the work
   [rock?] itself, the great foundation and corner-stone of the church,
   the Lord Jesus, who is" God blessed for ever." They are those, I say,
   whom I would warn you of, in whom, of old and of late, the spirit of
   error hath set up itself with such an efficacy of pride and delusion,
   as, by all ways, means, [and] devices imaginable, to despoil our dear
   and blessed Redeemer, our Holy One, of his "eternal power and Godhead;"
   or to reject the eternal Son of God, and to substitute in his room a
   Christ of their own, one like themselves, and no more; to adulterate
   the church, and turn aside the saints to a thing of naught. If I may
   enjoy your patience whilst I give a brief account of them, their ways
   and endeavours for the compassing of their cursed ends; of our present
   concernment in their actings and seductions; of the fire kindled by
   them at our doors; of the sad diffusion of their poison throughout the
   world, beyond what enters into the hearts of the most of men to
   imagine, -- I shall subjoin thereunto those cautions and directions
   which, with all humbleness, I have to tender to you, to guide some, and
   strengthen others, and stir up all to be watchful against this great,
   and I hope the last considerable attempt of Satan (by way of seduction
   and temptation) against the foundation of the gospel.

   Those, then, who of old opposed the doctrine of the Trinity, especially
   of the deity of Christ, his person and natures, may be referred to
   three heads, and of them and their ways this is the sum:--

   The first sort of them may be reckoned to be those who are commonly
   esteemed to be followers of Simon Magus, known chiefly by the names of
   Gnostics and Valentinians. These, with their abominable figments of
   æons, and their combinations, conjugations, genealogies, and
   unintelligible imaginations, wholly overthrowing the whole revelation
   of God concerning himself and his will, the Lord Jesus and the gospel,
   chiefly, with their leaders, Marcus, Basilides, Ptolemæus, Valentinus
   secundus (all following or imitating Simon Magus and Menander), of all
   others most perplexed and infected the primitive church: as Irenæus,
   lib. i.; Tertullian, Præscrip. ad Hæret. cap. xlix.; Philastrius, in
   his catalogue of heretics; Epiphanius in Panario, lib. i. tom. ii.; and
   Augustine, in his book of Heresies, [5] "ad quod vult deus manifeste."
   To these may be added Tatianus, Cerdo, Marcion, and their companions
   (of whom see Tertullian at large, and Eusebius, in their respective
   places.) I shall not separate from them Montanus, with his
   enthusiastical formal associates; in whose abominations it was hoped
   that these latter days might have been unconcerned, until the present
   madness of some, commonly called Quakers, renewed their follies; but
   these may pass (with the Manichees), and those of the like fond
   imaginations, that ever and anon troubled the church with their madness
   and folly.

   Of the second rank Cerinthus is the head, with Judaizing Ebion; [6]
   both denying expressly the deity of Christ, and asserting him to be but
   a mere man; even in the entrance of the Gospel being confounded by
   John, as is affirmed by Epiphanius, Hær. 51. "Hieronymus de
   Seriptoribus Ecclesiasticis de Johanne." The same abomination was again
   revived by Theodotus, called Coriarius (who, having once denied Christ,
   was resolved to do so always); excommunicated on that account by
   Victor, as Eusebius relates, Hist. Eccles. lib. 5 cap. ult., where he
   gives also an account of his associates in judgment, Artemon,
   Asclepiodotus, Natalius, etc.; and the books written against him are
   there also mentioned. But the most notorious head and patron of this
   madness was Paulus Samosatenus, bishop of Antioch, anno 272; of whose
   pride and passion, folly, followers, assistants, opposition, and
   excommunication, the history is extant at large in Eusebius. This man's
   pomp and folly, his compliance with the Jews and Zenobia, the queen of
   the Palmyrians, who then invaded the eastern parts of the Roman empire,
   made him so infamous to all Christians, that the Socinians do scarce
   plead for him, or own him as the author of their opinion. Of him who
   succeeded him in his opposition to Jesus Christ, some fifty or sixty
   years after, namely, Photinus, bishop of Sirmium, they constantly
   boast. Of Samosatenus and his heresy, see Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. 7
   cap. 29, 30 and Hilary, De Synodis; of Photinus, Socrat. Eccles. Hist.
   lib. 2 cap. 24, 25. And with these do our present Socinians expressly
   agree in the matter of the person of Christ. [7]

   To the third head I refer that deluge of Arianism, whose rise,
   conception, author, and promoters, advantages, success, and
   propagation; the persecutions, cruelty, and tyranny of the rulers,
   emperors, kings, and governors infected with it; its extent and
   continuance, -- are known to all who have taken care in the least to
   inquire what was the state of the church of God in former days, that
   heresy being as it were the flood of water that pursued the church for
   some ages. Of Macedonius, Nestorius, and Eutyches, -- the first denying
   the deity of the Holy Ghost, the second the hypostatical union of the
   two natures of Christ, and the last confounding them in his person, --
   I shall not need to speak. These by the Socinians of our days are
   disclaimed. [8]

   In the second sort chiefly we are at present concerned. Now, to give an
   account, from what is come down unto us, by testimonies of good report
   and esteem, concerning those named, Theodotus, Paulus, Photinus, and
   the rest of the men who were the predecessors of them with whom we have
   to do, and undertook the same work in the infancy of the church which
   these are now engaged in when it is drawing, with the world, to its
   period, with what were their ways, lives, temptations, ends,
   agreements, differences among them, and in reference to the persons of
   our present contest (of whom a full account shall be given), is not my
   aim nor business. It hath been done by others; and to do it with any
   exactness, beyond what is commonly known, would take up more room than
   to this preface is allotted. Some things peculiarly seem of concernment
   for our observation, from the time wherein some of them acted their
   parts in the service of their master. What could possibly be more
   desired, for the safeguarding of any truth from the attempts of
   succeeding generations, and for giving it a security above all control,
   than that, upon public and owned opposition, it should receive a
   confirmation by men acted by the Holy Ghost, and giving out their
   sentence by inspiration from God? That, among other important heads of
   the gospel (as that of justification by faith and not by works, of
   Christian liberty, of the resurrection of the dead), this most glorious
   truth, of the eternal deity of the Son of God, underwent an open
   opposition from some of them above written, during the life of some of
   the apostles, before the writing of the Gospel by John, and was
   expressly vindicated by him in the beginning thereof, is acknowledged
   by all who have in any measure inquired into and impartially weighed
   the reports of those days. What could the heart of the most resolved
   unbeliever desire more for his satisfaction, than that God should speak
   from heaven for the conviction of his folly and ignorance? or what can
   our adversaries expect more from us, when we tell them that God himself
   immediately determined in the controversy wherein they are engaged?
   Perhaps they think that if he should now speak from heaven they would
   believe him. So said the Jews to Christ, if he would come down from the
   cross when they had nailed him to it, in the sight and under the
   contempt of many miracles greater than the delivery of himself could
   any way appear to be. The rich man in torments thought his brethren
   would repent if one came from the dead and preached to them. Abraham
   tells him, "If they will not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will
   they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." Doubtless, if what
   is already written be not sufficient to convince our adversaries,
   though God should speak from heaven they would not believe, nor indeed
   can, if they will abide by the fundamental principles of their
   religion. Under this great disadvantage did the persuasion of the
   Socinians set out in the world, that Christ is only psilos anthropos,
   -- by nature no more but a man; so that persons not deeply acquainted
   with the methods of Satan and the darkness of the minds of men could
   not but be ready to conclude it certainly bound up in silence for ever.
   But how speedily it revived, with what pride and passion it was once
   and again endeavoured to be propagated in the world, those who have
   read the stories of Paulus Samosatenus are fully acquainted, who gumne
   te kephale, blasphemed the Son of God as one no more than a man. In
   some space of time, these men being decried by the general consent of
   the residue of mankind professing the name of Jesus Christ, and their
   abomination destroyed by the sword of faith, managed in the hands of
   the saints of those days, Satan perceiving himself at a loss and under
   an impossibility of prevalency, whilst the grossness of the error he
   strove to diffuse terrified all sorts from having any thing to do
   therewith, he puts on it, by the help of Arius and his followers,
   another gloss and appearance, with a pretence of allowing Christ a
   deity, though a subordinate, created, made, divine nature, which in the
   fulness of time assumed flesh of the virgin; -- this opinion being,
   indeed, no less really destructive to the true and eternal deity of the
   Son of God than that of theirs before mentioned, who expressly affirmed
   him to be a mere man, and to have had no existence before his nativity
   at Bethlehem; yet having got a new pretence and colour of ascribing
   something more excellent and sublime unto him than that whereof we are
   all in common partakers, it is incredible with what speedy progress,
   like the breaking out of a mighty flood, it overspread the face of the
   earth. It is true, it had in its very entrance all the advantages of
   craft, fraud, and subtilty, and in its carrying on, of violence, force,
   and cruelty, and from the beginning to its end, of ignorance,
   blindness, superstition, and profaneness, among the generality of them
   with whom it had to deal, that ever any corrupt folly of the mind of
   man met withal. The rise, progress, cruelty, and continuance of this
   sect, with the times and seasons that passed with it over the nations,
   its entertainment by the many barbarous nations which wasted, spoiled,
   and divided among themselves the Roman empire, with their parting with
   it upon almost as evil an account as at first they embraced it, are
   not, as I said, my business now to discover. God purposing to revenge
   the pride, ingratitude, ignorance, profaneness, and idolatry of the
   world, which was then in a great measure got in amongst the professors
   of Christianity, by another more spiritual, cruel, subtile, and lasting
   "mystery of iniquity," caused this abomination of Arianism to give
   place to the power of the then growing Roman antichristian state,
   which, about the sixth or seventh century of years since the
   incarnation of the Son of God, having lost all church order and
   communion of the institution of Jesus Christ, fell into an earthly,
   political, carnal combination, authorized and animated by the spirit of
   Satan, for the ends of superstition, idolatry, persecution, pride, and
   atheism; which thereby ever since [have been] vigorously pursued.

   With these Arians, [9] as was said, do our Socinians refuse communion,
   and will not be called after their name: not that their profession is
   better than theirs, or that they have much to blame in what they
   divulge, though they agree not with them in allowing a pre-existing
   nature to Christ before his incarnation; but that generation of men
   having made themselves infamous to posterity by their wickedness,
   perjuries, crafts, and bloody cruelties, and having been pursued by
   eminent and extraordinary judgments from God, they are not willing to
   partake of the prejudices which they justly lie under.

   From the year 600, for divers ages, we have little noise of these men's
   abominations, as to the person of Christ, in the world. Satan had
   something else to busy himself about.

   A design he had in hand that was like to do him more service than any
   of his former attempts. Having, therefore, tried his utmost in open
   opposition to the person of Christ (the dregs of the poison thus shed
   abroad infecting in some measure a great part of the east to this day),
   by a way never before heard of, and which Christians were not exercised
   with nor in any measure aware of, he subtilely ruins and overthrows all
   his offices and the whole benefit of his mediation, and introduceth
   secretly a new worship from that which he appointed, by the means and
   endeavours of men pretending to act and do all that they did for the
   advancement of his kingdom and glory. And therefore, whilst the fatal
   apostasy of the western world, under the Roman antichrist, was
   contriving, carrying on, and heightening, till it came to its discovery
   and ruin, he stirs not at all with his old engines, which had brought
   in a revenue of obedience to his kingdom in no measure proportionable
   to this, which by this new device he found accruing to him. But when
   the appointed time of mercy was come, that God would visit his people
   with light from above, and begin to unravel the mystery of iniquity,
   whose abominations had destroyed the souls of them that embraced it,
   and whose cruelty had cut off the lives of thousands who had opposed
   it, by the Reformation, eminently and successfully begun and carried on
   from the year 1517, Satan perceiving that even this his great
   masterpiece of deceit and subtilty was like to fail him, and not to do
   him that service which formerly it had done, he again sets on foot his
   first design, of oppugning the eternal deity of the Son of God, still
   remembering that the ruin of his kingdom arose from the Godhead of his
   person and the efficacy of his mediation. So, then, as for the first
   three hundred years of the profession of the name of Christ in the
   world, he had variously opposed the Godhead of our blessed Saviour, by
   Simon Magus, Ebion, Cerinthus, Paulus Samosatenus, Marcus, Basilides,
   Valentinus, Calarbasus, Marcion, Photinus, Theodotus, and others; and
   from their dissipation and scattering, having gathered them all to a
   head in Arius and his abomination, -- which sometimes with a mighty
   prevalency of force and violence, sometimes more subtilely (putting out
   by the way the several branches of Macedonianism, Nestorianism,
   Eutychianism, all looking the same way in their tendency therewith), --
   he managed almost for the space of the next three hundred years
   ensuing; and losing at length that hold, he had spent more than double
   that space of time in carrying on his design of the great
   anti-christian papal apostasy; being about the times before mentioned
   most clearly and eminently discovered in his wicked design, and being
   in danger to lose his kingdom, which he had been so long in possession
   of, intending if it were possible to retrieve his advantage again, he
   sets on those men who had been instrumental to reduce the Christian
   religion into its primitive state and condition with those very errors
   and abominations wherewith he opposed and assailed the primitive
   professors thereof, -- if they will have the apostles' doctrine, they
   shall have the opposition that was made unto it in the apostles' times:
   his hopes being possibly the same that formerly they were (but
   assuredly Christ will prevent him); -- for as whilst the professors of
   the religion of Jesus Christ were spiritual, and full of the power of
   that religion they did profess, they defended the truth thereof, either
   by suffering, as under Constantius, Valens, and the Goths and Vandals,
   or by spiritual means and weapons; so when they were carnal, and lost
   the life of the gospel, yet endeavouring to retain the truth of the
   letter thereof, falling on carnal, politic ways for the supportment of
   it, and the suppressing of what opposed it, Satan quickly closed in
   with them, and accomplished all his ends by them, causing them to walk
   in all those ways of law, policy, blood, cruelty, and violence, for the
   destruction of the truth, which they first engaged in for the rooting
   out of errors and heresies. "Haud ignota loquor." Those who have
   considered the occasions and advantages of the bishop of Rome's rise
   and progress know these things to be so. Perhaps, I say, he might have
   thoughts to manage the same Or the like design at the beginning of the
   Reformation, when, with great craft and subtilty, he set on foot again
   his opposition to the person of Christ; which being the business
   chiefly under consideration, I shall give some brief account thereof.

   Those who have formerly communicated their thoughts and observations to
   us on this subject have commonly given rise to their discourses from
   Servetus, with the transactions about him in Helvetia, and the ending
   of his tragedy at Geneva. The things of him being commonly known, and
   my design being to deal with them in their chief seat and residence,
   where, after they had a while hovered about most nations of Europe,
   they settled themselves, I shall forbear to pursue them up and down in
   their flight, and meet with them only at their nest in Poland and the
   regions adjoining. The leaders of them had most of them separated
   themselves from the Papacy on pretence of embracing the reformed
   religion; and under that covert were a long time sheltered from
   violence, and got many advantages of insinuating their abominations
   (which they were thoroughly drenched withal before they left the
   Papacy) into the minds of many who professed the gospel.

   The first open breach they made in Poland was in the year (something
   having been attempted before), most of the leaders being Italians, men
   of subtile and serpentine wits. The chief leaders of them were Georgius
   Blandrata, Petrus Statorius, Franciscus Lismaninus; all which had been
   eminent in promoting the Reformation. [10]

   Upon their first tumultuating, Statorius, to whom afterwards Socinus
   wrote sundry epistles, and lived with him in great intimacy, was
   summoned to a meeting of ministers, upon an accusation that he denied
   that the Holy Spirit was to be invocated. Things being not yet ripe,
   the man knowing that if he were cast out by them he should not know
   where to obtain shelter, he secured himself by dissimulation, and
   subscribed this confession: "I receive and reverence the prophetical
   and apostolical doctrine, containing the true knowledge of God the
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and freely profess that God the Father,
   Son, and Holy Ghost, ought to be worshipped with the same religion or
   worship, distinctly or respectively, and to be invocated, according to
   the truth of the holy Scripture. And, lastly, I do plainly detest every
   heretical blasphemy concerning God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
   whether it be Arian, Servetian, Eunomian, or Stancarian. [11] "And this
   confession is to be seen in the acts of that convention, under his own
   hand, to this day; which notwithstanding, he was a fierce opposer of
   the doctrine here professed all his days afterward.

   And I the rather mention this, because I am not without too much ground
   of persuasion that thousands of the same judgment with this man do at
   this day, by the like dissimulation, live and enjoy many advantages
   both in the Papacy and among the reformed churches, spreading the
   poison of their abominations as they can. This Statorius I find, by the
   frequent mention made of him by Socinus, to have lived many years in
   Poland, with what end and issue of his life I know not, nor more of him
   but what is contained in Beza's two epistles to him, whose scholar he
   had been, when he seemed to have had other opinions about the essence
   of God than those he afterward settled in by the instruction of
   Socinus.

   And this man was one of the first heads of that multitude of men
   commonly known by the name of Anabaptists among the Papists (who took
   notice of little but their outward worship), who, having entertained
   strange, wild, and blasphemous thoughts concerning the essence of God,
   were afterward brought to a kind of settlement by Socinus, in that
   religion he had prepared to serve them all; and into his word at last
   consented the whole droves of Essentiators, Tritheists, Arians, and
   Sabellians, that swarmed in those days in Silesia, Moravia, and some
   other parts of Germany.

   For Blandrata, his story is so well known, from the epistles of Calvin
   and Beza, and others, that I shall not insist much upon it. The sum of
   what is commonly known of him is collected by Hornbeck.

   The records of the synods in Poland of the reformed churches give us
   somewhat farther of him; as doth Socinus also against Weik. Being an
   excellent physician, he was entertained, at his first coming into
   Poland, by Prince Radzivil, the then great patron of the reformed
   religion in those parts of the world, -- one of the same family with
   this captain-general of the Polonian forces for the great dukedom of
   Lithuania, a man of great success in many fights and battles against
   the Muscovites, continuing the same office to this day. To him Calvin
   instantly wrote, that he should take care of Blandrata, as a man not
   only inclinable to, but wholly infected with, Servetianism. [12] In
   that, as in many other things he admonished men of by his epistles,
   that wise and diligent person had the fate to tell the truth and not be
   believed. See Calvin's epistles, about the year 1561. But the man on
   this occasion being sent to the meeting at Pinckzow (as Statorius), he
   subscribes this confession:--

   "I profess myself to believe in one God the Father, and in one Lord
   Jesus Christ, his Son, and in one Holy Ghost, whereof each is
   essentially God. I detest the plurality of Gods, seeing to us there is
   one only God, indivisible in essence. I confess three distinct persons,
   the eternal deity and generation of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost,
   true and eternal God, proceeding from them both." [13]

   This did the wretched man think meet to do, that he might preserve the
   good esteem of his patron and reserve himself for a fitter opportunity
   of doing mischief; which also he did, obtaining a testimonial from the
   whole meeting of his soundness in the faith, with letters to Prince
   Radzivil and to Calvin signifying the same.

   Not long after this, by the great repute of his skill in physic, he
   became known and physician to Stephen, king of Poland; by whose favour,
   having no small liberty indulged him, he became the patron of all the
   Antitrinitarians of all sorts throughout Poland and Transylvania. What
   books he wrote, and what pains he took in propagating their cause, hath
   been declared by others. The last epistle of Socinus, in order as they
   are printed (it being without date, yet evidently written many years
   before most of them that went before it), is to this Blandrata, whose
   inscription is, "Amplissimo clarissimoque viro Georgio Blandratæ
   Stephani invictissimi regis Poloniæ, etc., archiatro et conciliario
   intimo, domino, æ patrono suo perpetua observantia colendo; et
   subscribitur, Tibi in Domino Jesu deditissimus cliens tuus F. S." To
   that esteem was he grown amongst them, because of his advantages to
   insinuate them into the knowledge of great men, which they mostly aimed
   at; so that afterward, when Socinus wrote his answer about magistrates
   to Palæologus, in defence of the Racovians, [14] Marcellus
   Squarcialupus, his countryman, a man of the same persuasion with him,
   falls foully on him, that he would venture to do it without the
   knowledge and consent of this great patron of theirs.

   But though this man by his dissimulation and falsehood thus escaped
   censure, and by his art and cunning insinuation obtained high
   promotions and heaped up great riches in the world, yet even in this
   life he escaped not the revenging hand of God. He was found at length
   with his neck broke in his bed; by what hand none knoweth. Wherefore
   Socinus, observing that this judgment of God upon him, as that on
   Franciscus David (of which mention shall be made afterward), would be
   fixed on in the thoughts of men to the prejudice of the cause which he
   favoured, considering more what was for his interest than what was
   decent or convenient, decries him for an apostate to the Jesuits before
   he was so destroyed, and intimates that he was strangled in his bed by
   a kinsman whom he had made his heir, for haste to take possession of
   his great wealth. [15]

   The story I have adjoined at large, that the man's ingenuity and
   thankfulness to his friend and patron may be seen. He tells us, that
   before the death of Stephen, king of Poland, he was turned from their
   profession by the Jesuits. Stephen, king of Poland, died in the year
   1588, according to Helvicus. That very year did Socinus write his
   answer to Volanus, the second part whereof he inscribed with all the
   magnifical titles before mentioned to Blandrata, professing himself his
   devoted client, and him the great patron of their religion! So that
   though I can easily believe what he reports of his covetousness and
   treachery, and the manner of his death, yet as to his apostasy (though
   possibly he might fall more and more under the power of his atheism), I
   suppose the great reason of imputing that to him was to avoid the
   scandal of the fearful judgment of God on him in his death.

   For Lismaninus, the third person mentioned, he was accused of Arianism
   at a convention at Morden, anno 1553, and there acquitted with a
   testimonial. [16] But in the year 1561, at another meeting at
   Whodrislave, he was convicted of double dealing, and after that wholly
   fell off to the Antitrinitarians, and in the issue drowned himself in a
   well. [17]

   And these were the chief settled troublers at the first of the Polonian
   reformed churches. The stories of Paulus Alciatus, Valentinus Gentilis,
   Bernardus Ochinus, and some others, are so well known, out of the
   epistles of Calvin, Beza, Bullinger, Zanchius, with what hath of late
   from them been collected by Cloppenburgius, Hornbeck, Maresius,
   Becmannus, etc., that it cannot but be needless labour for me to go
   over them again.

   That which I aim at is, from their own writings, and what remains on
   record concerning them, to give a brief account of the first breaking
   in of Anti-trinitarianism into the reformed churches of Poland, and
   their confused condition before headed by Socinus, into whose name they
   have since been all baptized. This, then, was the state of the churches
   in those days: The reformed religion spreading in great abundance, and
   churches being multiplied every day in Poland, Lithuania, and the parts
   adjoining; some tumults having been raised, and stirs made by Osiander
   and Stancarus about the essential righteousness and mediation of Christ
   (concerning which the reader may consult Calvin at large); many wild
   and foolish opinions being scattered up and down, about the nature of
   God, the Trinity, and Anabaptism, by many foreigners, sundry being
   thereby defiled, the opinions of Servetus having wholly infected sundry
   Italians: the persons before spoken of, then living at Geneva and about
   the towns of the Switzers, that embraced the gospel, being forced to
   flee for fear of being dealt withal as Servetus was (the judgment of
   most Christian rulers in whose days leading them to such a procedure,
   how rightly I do not now determine), scarce any one of them escaping
   without imprisonment and abjuration (an ill foundation of their after
   profession), they went most of them into Poland, looked on by them as a
   place of liberty, and joined themselves to the reformed churches in
   those places, and continuing many years in their communion, took the
   opportunity to entice and seduce many ministers with others, and to
   strengthen them who were fallen into the abominations mentioned before
   their coming to them.

   After many tergiversations, many examinations of them, many false
   subscriptions, in the year 1562, they fell into open division and
   separation from the reformed churches. [18] The ministers that fell off
   with them, besides Lismaninus and his companions (of whom before), were
   Gregorius Pauli, Stanislaus Lutonius, Martinus Crovicius, Stanislaus
   Paclesius, Georgius Schomanus, and others, most of whom before had
   taken good pains in preaching the gospel. The chief patrons and
   promoters were Johannes Miemoljevius, Hieronymus Philoponius, Johannes
   Cazaccovius, the one a judge, the other a captain, the third a
   gentleman, -- all men of great esteem.

   The year that this breach was made, Lælius Socinus, then of the age of
   thirty-seven years, who laid the foundations that his nephew after
   built upon, died in Switzerland, as the author of the life of Faustus
   Socinus informs us. [19] The man's life is known: he was full of
   Servetianism, and had attempted to draw sundry men of note to his
   abominations; a man of great subtilty and cunning, as Beza says of him,
   [20] incredibly furnished for contradiction and sophism; which the
   author of the life of Socinus phrases, he was "suggerendæ veritatis
   mirus artifex." He made, as I said, many private attempts on sundry
   persons to entice them to Photinianism; on some with success, on others
   without. Of his dealing with him, and the advantage he had so to do,
   Zanchius gives an account in his preface to his book "De Tribus
   Elohim." [21]

   He was, as the author of the life of Faustus Socinus relates, in a
   readiness to have published his notions and conceptions, when God, by
   his merciful providence, to prevent a little the pouring out of the
   poison by so skillful a hand, took him off by sudden death; and Faustus
   himself gives the same account of the season of his death in an epistle
   to Dudithius. [22]

   At his death, Faustus Socinus, being then about the age of twenty-three
   years, seizing upon all his uncle's books, after a while returned into
   Italy, and there spent in courtship and idleness in Florence twelve
   years; which he afterward grievously lamented, as shall be declared.
   Leaving him a while to his pleasure in the court of the great duke, we
   may make back again into Poland, and consider the progress of the
   persons who made way for his coming amongst them. Having made their
   separation, and drawn many after them, they at length brought their
   business to that height that they came to a disputation with the
   reformed ministers at Petricove [23] (where the parliament of the
   kingdom then was) by the permission of Sigismund the king, in the year
   1565, whereof the ensuing account is given by Antonius Possevine the
   Jesuit, in Atheis, sui sæculi, cap. xiii. fol. 15.

   The assembly of states was called against the Muscovians. The nobility
   desiring a conference between the ministers of the reformed churches
   and the Antitrinitarians, it was allowed by Sigismund the king. On the
   part of the reformed churches there were four ministers; as many of the
   other side came also prepared for the encounter. Being met, after some
   discourse the chief marshal of the kingdom, then a Protestant, used
   these words, "Seeing the proposition to be debated is agreed on, begin,
   in the name of the one God and the Trinity." [24] Whereupon one of the
   opposite party instantly cried out, "We cannot here say Amen, nor do we
   know that God, the Trinity." [25] "Whereunto the ministers subjoined,
   "We have no need of any other proposition, seeing this hath offered
   itself; for, God assisting, we will, and are ready to demonstrate that
   the Holy Ghost doth not teach us any other God in the Scripture, but
   him only who is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; that is, one God in
   trinity." [26]

   This colloquy continued three days. In the first, the ministers who
   were the opponents (the other always choosing to answer), by express
   texts of Scripture in abundance, confirmed the truth. In the beginning
   of their testimonies they appealed to the beginning of the Old and New
   Testament; [27] and upon both places confounded their adversaries. The
   second day the testimonies of the ancient writers of the church were
   produced, with no less success. And on the third, the stories of Arius
   and some other heretics of old. The issue of the disputation was to the
   great advantage of the truth; which Possevine himself cannot deny,
   though he affirms a little after that the Calvinists could not confute
   the Trinitarians, as he calls them, though they used the same arguments
   that the Catholics did, cap. xiv. p. 366.

   Possevine confesses that the ministers (as they called themselves) of
   Sarmatia and Transylvania, in their book of the False and True
   Knowledge of God, took advantage of the images of the Catholics; [28]
   for whose satisfaction, it seems, he subjoins the theses of Thyreus,
   wherein he labours to prove the use of those abominable idols to be
   lawful: of which in the close of this address.

   And this was the first great obstacle that was laid in the way of the
   progress of the reformed religion in Poland; which, by Satan's taking
   the advantage of this horrible scandal, is at this day, in those parts
   of the world, weak and oppressed. With what power the gospel did come
   upon the inhabitants of those countries at the first, and what number
   of persons it prevailed upon to forsake their dumb idols, which in
   Egyptian darkness they had long worshipped, is evident from the
   complaint of Cichovius the priest, who tells us that "about those
   times, in the whole parliament of the dukedom of Lithuania, there were
   not above one or two Catholics," as he calls them, "besides the
   bishops." [29] Yea, among the bishops themselves, some were come off to
   the reformed churches; amongst whom Georgius Petrovicius, bishop of
   Sarmogitia, is reckoned by Diaterieus, Chron. p. 49. Yea, and so far
   had the gospel influenced those nations, that in the year 1542, upon
   the death of King Sigismund II., during the interregnum, a decree was
   made in parliament, with general consent, that no prejudice should
   arise to any for the protestant religion, but that a firm union should
   be between the persons of both religions, popish and protestant; and
   that whosoever was chosen king should take an oath to preserve this
   union and the liberty of the protestant religion. -- Sarricius, Annal.
   Pol. lib. viii. p. 403.

   And when Henry, duke of Anjou, brother to Charles IX., king of France,
   was elected king of Poland [30] (being then a man of great esteem in
   the world, for the wars which in France he had managed for the Papists
   against the Prince of Conde and the never-enough-magnified Gasper
   Coligni, [31] being also consenting at least to the barbarous massacre
   of the Protestants in that nation), and coming to the church where he
   was to be crowned, by the advice of the clergy, would have avoided the
   oath of preserving the Protestants and keeping peace between the
   dissenters in religion, John Shirli, palatine of Cracovia, took up the
   crown, and making ready to go away with it out of the convention, cried
   out, "Si non jurabis, non regnabis," -- "If you will not swear, you
   shall not reign;" and thereby compelled him to take the oath agreed
   upon.

   This progress, I say, had the doctrine of the gospel made in those
   nations, so considerable a portion of the body of the people were won
   over to the belief of it, when, through the craft and subtilty of the
   old enemy of the propagation thereof, by this apostasy of some to
   Tritheism, as Gregorius Pauli, of some to Arianism, as Erasmus
   Johannes, of some to Photinianism, as Statorius and Blandrata, some to
   Judaism, as Seidelius (of whom afterward), the foundation of the whole
   building was loosened, and, instead of a progress, the religion has
   gone backwards almost constantly to this day. When this difference
   first fell out, the Papists [32] not once moved a mouth or pen for a
   long time against the broachers of all the blasphemies mentioned,
   hoping that by the breaches made by them on the reformed churches they
   should at length be able to triumph over both; for which end, in their
   disputes since with Protestants, they have striven to take advantage of
   the apostasy of many of those who had pretended to plead against the
   Papacy in behalf of the reformed churches and afterward turned
   Antitrinitarians, as I remember it is particularly insisted on in an
   English treatise which I saw many years ago, called "Micheus, the
   Converted Jew." And indeed it is supposed that both Paulus Alciatus and
   Ochinus turned Mohammedans. [33]

   Having thus, then, disturbed the carrying on of the Reformation, many
   ministers and churches falling off to Tritheism and Samosatenianism,
   they laid the foundation of their meeting at Racovia; from which place
   they have been most known since and taken notice of in the world. The
   first foundation of what they call the "church" in that place was made
   by a confluence of strangers out of Bohemia and Moravia, with some
   Polonians, [34] known only by the name of Anabaptists, but professing a
   community of goods and a setting up of the kingdom of Christ, calling
   Racovia, where they met, the New Jerusalem, or at least professing that
   there they intended to build and establish the New Jerusalem, with
   other fanatical follies; which Satan hath revived in persons not unlike
   them, and caused to be acted over again, in the days wherein we live,
   though, for the most part, with less appearance of holiness and
   integrity of conversation than in them who went before.

   The leaders of these men, who called themselves their "ministers," were
   Gregorius Pauli and Daniel Bielenscius: of whom Bielenscius afterward
   recanted; and Gregorius Pauli, being utterly wearied, ran away from
   them as from a hard service, [35] and, as Faustus Socinus tells us, in
   his preface to his answer to Palæologus, in his old age left off all
   study, and betook himself to other employments. Such were the persons
   by whom this stir began.

   This Gregorius Pauli, Schlusselburgius very ignorantly affirms to have
   been the head of the Antitrinitarians and their captain, [36] when he
   was a mere common trooper amongst them, and followed after others,
   running away betimes, -- an enthusiastical, antimagistratical heretic,
   pleading for community of goods. But this Gregory had said that Luther
   did but the least part of the work for the destruction of antichrist;
   and hence is the anger of Doctor Conradus, who everywhere shows himself
   as zealous of the honour of Luther as of Jesus Christ. So was the man,
   who had some divinity, but scarce any Latin at all.

   Be pleased now to take a brief view of the state of these men before
   the coming of Faustus Socinus into Poland and Transylvania, both these
   nations, after the death of Sigismund II., being in the power of the
   same family of the Bathori. Of those who professed the reformed
   religion and were fallen from the Papacy, there were three sorts, --
   Lutherans, and Calvinists, and the United Brethren; which last were
   originally Bohemian exiles, but, professing and practising a more
   strict way of church order and fellowship than the other, had very many
   of the nobility of Poland and the people joined to their communion. The
   two latter agreed in all points of doctrine, and at length came, in
   sundry meetings and synods, to a fair agreement and correspondency,
   forbearing one another wherein they could not concur in judgment. Now,
   as these grew up to union amongst themselves, the mixed multitude of
   several nations that had joined themselves unto them in their departure
   out of Egypt fell a lusting after the abominations mentioned, and
   either withdrew themselves or were thrown out from their communion.

   At first there were almost as many minds as men amongst them, the
   tessera of their agreement among themselves being purely opposition to
   the Trinity, upon what principle soever. Had a man learned to blaspheme
   the holy Trinity, were it on Photinian, Arian, Sabellian, yea,
   Mohammedan or Judaical principles, he was a companion and brother
   amongst them! To this the most of them added Anabaptism, with the
   necessity of it, and among the Papists were known by no other name.
   That they opposed the Trinity, that they consented not to the reformed
   churches, was their religion. For Pelagianism, afterward introduced by
   Socinus, there was little or no mention [of it] among them. In this
   estate, divided amongst themselves, notwithstanding some attempts in
   their synods (for synods they had) to keep a kind of peace in all their
   diversities of opinions, spending their time in disputes and
   quarrellings, were they when Faustus Socinus came into Poland; who at
   length brought them into the condition wherein they are, by the means
   and ways that shall be farther insisted on.

   And this state of things, considering how not unlike the condition of
   multitudes of men is thereunto in these nations wherein we live, hath
   oftentimes made me fear that if Satan should put it into the heart of
   any person of learning and ability to serve his lust and ambition with
   craft, wisdom, and diligence, it were not impossible for him to gather
   the dispersed and divided opinionatists of our days to a consent in
   some such body of religion as that which Socinus framed for the
   Polonians. But of him, his person, and labours, by what ways and means
   he attained his end, it may not be unacceptable, from his own and
   friends' writings, to give some farther account.

   That Faustus Socinus, of Sienna, was born of a good and ancient family,
   famous for their skill in the law, in the month of December in the year
   1539; that he lived in his own country until he was about the age of
   twenty years; that then leaving his country after his uncle Lælius, he
   went to Leyden, and lived there three years; that then, upon the death
   of his uncle, having got his books, he returned into Italy, and lived
   in the court of the great Duke of Tuscany twelve years, about the close
   of which time he wrote his book in Italian, "De Authoritate Sacræ
   Scripturæ;" that leaving his country he came to Basil in Switzerland,
   and abode there three years and somewhat more, -- are things commonly
   known, and so little to our purpose that I shall not insist upon them.

   All the while he was at Basil and about Germany he kept his opinions
   much to himself, being intent upon the study of his uncle Lælius'
   notes, as the Polonian gentleman who wrote his life confesseth; [37]
   whereunto he added the Dialogues of Bernardus Ochinus, as himself
   acknowledgeth, which about that time were turned into Latin by
   Castalio, [38] as he professed, to get money by his labour to live upon
   (though he pleads that he read Ochinus' Dialogues in Poland, [39] and
   as it seems not before), and from thence he was esteemed to have taken
   his doctrine of the mediation of Christ.

   The papers of his uncle Lælius, of which himself often makes mention,
   were principally his comment upon the first chapter of St John, and
   some notes upon sundry texts of Scripture giving testimony to the deity
   of Christ; among which Faustus extols that abominable corruption of
   John viii. 58, of which afterward I shall speak at large, Socin.
   Respon. ad Eras. Johan. His comment on the first of John, [40] Beza
   tells us, is the most depraved and corrupt that ever was put forth, its
   author having outgone all that went before him in depraving that
   portion of Scripture.

   The comment itself is published by Junius, "in defensione sanctæ
   Trinitatis," and confuted by him; and Zanchius, at large, "De Tribus
   Elohim, lib. vi. cap. ii., et deinceps;" Faustus varying something from
   his uncle in the carrying on of the same design.

   His book, "De Jesu Christo Servatore," he wrote, as the author of his
   life assures us, whilst he was in and about Basil, as also many
   passages in his epistles and other writings manifest.

   About the year 1575 he began it, which he finished about the year 1578,
   although the book was not printed till the year 1594; [41] for upon the
   divulging of it (he then living at Cracovia), a tumult was raised
   against him by the unruly and disorderly students, wherein he was
   dragged up and down and beaten, and hardly escaped with his life;
   [against] which inhumane precedence he expostulates at large in an
   epistle to Martin Vaidovita, a professor of the university, by whose
   means he was delivered from being murdered. But this fell out in the
   year 1598, as is evident from the date of that epistle, four years
   after the book was printed.

   The book is written against one Covet, whom I know by nothing else but
   what of his disputes with Socinus is by him published. Socinus
   confesseth that he was a learned man, and in repute for learning; [42]
   and, indeed, if we may take an estimate of the man from the little that
   is there delivered of him, he was a godly, honest, and very learned
   man, and spake as much in the cause as might be expected or was
   needful, before farther opposition was made to the truth he did defend.
   Of all the books of him concerning whom we speak, this his disputation,
   "De Jesu Christo Servatore," is written with the greatest strength,
   subtilty, and plausibility, neither is any thing said afterward by
   himself or the rest of his followers that is not comprised in it. Of
   this book he was wont afterward to boast, as Crellius informs us, and
   to say, "That if he might have some excellent adversary to deal withal
   upon the point, he then would show what could farther be spoken of the
   subject." [43]

   This book, at its first coming out, was confuted by Gregorius
   Zarnovecius (as Socinus testifies in his epistle to Vaidovita) in the
   Polonian language: which was afterward translated into Latin by
   Conradus Huberus, and printed at Franeker, anno 1618; also by one Otho
   Casmannus; and thirdly, at large, by Sibrandus Lubbertus, anno 1611,
   who, together with his refutation, printed the whole book itself, I
   hope to no disadvantage of the truth, though a late apostate to Rome,
   whom we called here Hugh Cressey, but is lately commenced B. Serenus
   Cressey, a priest of the order of Benedict, and who would have been
   even a Carthusian (such high honour did the man aim at), tells us that
   some of his scholars procured him to do it, that so they might get the
   book itself in their hands. [44] But the book will speak for itself
   with indifferent readers, and for its clearness is extolled by Vossius.
   [45] Generally, all that have since written of that subject, in theses,
   common-places, lectures, comments, professed controversies, have made
   that book the ground of their procedure.

   One is not to be omitted, which is in the hands of all those who
   inquire into these things, or think that they are concerned in the
   knowledge of them; this is Grotius' "Defensio Fidei Catholicæ de
   Satisfactione Christi, adversus Faustum Socinum Senensem." Immediately
   upon the coming out of that book, animadversions were put forth against
   it by Harmanus Ravenspergerus, approved, as it seems, by our Doctor
   Prideaux. [46]

   The truth is, those animadversions of Ravenspergerus are many of them
   slight, and in sundry things he was mistaken; whereby his endeavours
   were easily eluded by the learned Vossius, [47] in his vindication of
   Grotius against him. Not that the dissertation of Grotius is free from
   being liable to many and just exceptions, partly in things wherein he
   was mistaken, partly wherein he failed in what he undertook (whereby
   many young students are deluded, as ere long may be manifested), but
   that his antagonist had not well laid his action, nor did pursue it
   with any skill.

   However, the interpretations of Scripture given therein by that learned
   man will rise up in judgment against many of the annotations which in
   his after-comments on the Scripture he hath divulged. His book was at
   length answered by Crellius, the successor of Valentinus Smalcius, in
   the school and society of Racovia, after which Grotius lived about
   twenty years, and never attempted any reply. Hereupon it has been
   generally concluded that the man was wrought over to drink in that
   which he had before published to be the most destructive poison of the
   church; [48] the belief whereof was exceedingly increased and cherished
   by an epistle of his to Crellius, who had subtilely managed the man,
   according to his desire of honour and regard, and by his annotations,
   of which we shall have causer to speak afterward. That book of Crellius
   has since been at large confuted by Essenius, [49] and enervated by a
   learned and ingenious author in his "Specimen Refutationis Crellii de
   Satisfactione Christi," published about the same time with the
   well-deserving labour of Essenius, in the year 1648.

   Most of the arguments and sophisms of Socinus about this business are
   refuted and dissolved by David Paræus, in his comment on the Romans,
   not mentioning the name of him whose objections they were.

   About the year 1608, Michael Gitichius gathered together the sum of
   what is argumentative in that book of Socinus against the satisfaction
   of Christ; which was answered by Ludovicus Lucius, [50] then professor
   at Hamburg, and the reply of Gitichius confuted and removed out of the
   way by the same hand. In that brief rescript of Lucius there is a clear
   attempt to the enervating of the whole book of Socinus, and that with
   good success, by way of a logical and scholastical procedure. Only, I
   cannot but profess my sorrow that, having in his first answer laid that
   solid foundation of the necessity of the satisfaction of Christ, from
   the eternal nature and justice of God, whereby it is absolutely
   impossible that, upon the consideration and supposition of sin
   committed, it should be pardoned without a due compensation, in his
   rejoinder to the reply of Gitichius, he closes with a commonly known
   expression of Augustine, "That God could, if he would, have delivered
   us without satisfaction, but he would not;" [51] so casting down the
   most stable and unmovable pillar of that doctrine which he so
   dexterously built up in spite of its adversaries.

   I dare boldly acquaint the younger students in these weighty points of
   the religion of Jesus Christ, that the truth of this one particular,
   concerning the eternal justice of God indispensably requiring the
   punishment of sin, being well established (for which end they have not
   only the consent but the arguments of almost all who have handled these
   controversies with skill and success), will securely carry them through
   all the sophisms of the adversaries, and cut all the knots which, with
   so much subtilty, they endeavour to tie and cast upon the doctrine of
   the satisfaction of Christ; as I have in part elsewhere demonstrated.
   [52] From this book also did Smalcius take the whole of what he has
   delivered about the death of Christ in his Racovian Catechism, not
   adding any thing at all of his own; which Catechism, as it was
   heretofore confuted by Frederick Bauldwinus, by order of the university
   of Wittenburgh, and is by several parcels by many removed out of the
   way, especially by Altingius and Maccovius, so of late it is wholly
   answered by Nicolaus Arnoldus, [53] now professor at Franeker; which
   coming lately to my hands prevented me from proceeding to a just,
   orderly refutation of the whole, as I was intended to do, although I
   hope the reader will not find any thing of importance therein omitted.

   To close the story of this book of Socinus, and the progress it hath
   made in the world: this I dare assure them who are less exercised in
   these studies, that though the whole of the treatise hath at first view
   a very plausible pretence and appearance, yet there is a line of
   sophistry running through it, which being once discovered (as, indeed,
   it may be easily felt, with the help of some few principles), the whole
   fabric of it will fall to the ground, and appear as weak and
   contemptible a piece as any we have to deal withal in that warfare
   which is to be undertaken for the truths of the gospel. This also I
   cannot omit, as to the rise of this abomination of denying the
   satisfaction of Christ, that as it seems to hay been first invented by
   the Pelagians, so in after ages it was vented Petrus Abelardus,
   professor of philosophy at Paris; of whom Bernard, who wrote against
   him, saith, "Habemus in Francia novum de vetere magtheologum, qui ab
   ineunte ætate sua in arte dialectica lusit, et nunc in Scripturis
   sanctis insanit:" and in his epistle (which is to Pope Innocent) about
   him, [54] he strongly confutes his imaginations about this very
   business; whereupon he was condemned in a council at Rome, held by the
   same Innocent. [55]

   This part of our faith being of so great weight and importance, the
   great basis and foundation of the church, you will find it at large
   insisted on and vindicated in the ensuing treatise.

   The author of the life of Socinus tells us (as he himself also gives in
   the information) that whilst he abode about Switzerland, at Basil and
   Tigurum [Zurich], he had a dispute with Puccius; which also is since
   published. This was before his going into Poland in the year 1578. [56]

   The story of this Puccius, because it may be of some use as to the
   present estate of the minds of many in the things of God, I shall
   briefly give from Socinus himself (Ep. 3, ad Matt. Radec.), and that as
   a tremendous example of the righteous judgment of God, giving up a
   person of a light, unstable spirit to fearful delusions, with a
   desperate issue. Originally he was a merchant of a good and noble
   family, but leaving his profession he betook himself to study, [57] and
   for his advantage therein came hither to Oxford. [58] After he had
   stayed here until he began to vent some paradoxes in religion, about
   the year 1565 (being not able here to prevail with any to close with
   him), he went to Basil, where there was a dispute between him and
   Socinus, before mentioned; in the issue whereof they both professed
   that they could agree in nothing in religion but that there was a God
   that made the world. At Basil he maintained universal redemption and a
   natural faith, as they then termed it, or an innate power of believing
   without the efficacy of the grace of God, for which he was compelled
   thence to depart; which doing he returned again into England, where,
   upon the same account, he was cast into prison for a season; thence
   being released, he went into Holland, from whence by letters he
   challenged Socinus to dispute, and went one thousand miles (namely, to
   Cracovia in Poland) afterward to make it good. After some disputes
   there (both parties condescending to them on very ridiculous
   conditions), Socinus seeming to prevail, by having most friends among
   the judges, as the other professed, he stayed there a while, and wrote
   a book, which he styled "The Shut Bible, and of Elias," wherein he
   laboured to deny all ordinances, ministry, and preaching, until Elias
   should come and restore all things. His reason was taken from the
   defection and apostasy of the church; wherein, said he, all truth and
   order was lost, the state of the church being not again to be
   recovered, unless some with apostolical authority and power of working
   miracles were immediately sent of God for that purpose. How far this
   persuasion hath prevailed with some in our days, we all know and
   lament. Puccius at length begins to fancy that he shall himself be
   employed in this great restoration that is to be made of the church, by
   immediate mission from God! Whilst he was in expectation of his call
   hereunto, there come two Englishmen into Poland, men pretending
   discourse with angels and revelations from God: one of them was the
   chief at revelations (their names I cannot learn), the other gave out
   what he received, in his daily converse with angels, and the words he
   heard from God, about the destruction of all the present frame of the
   worship of God. To these men Puccius joined himself, and followed them
   to Prague in Bohemia, though his friends dealt with him to the
   contrary, assuring him that one of his companions was a mountebank and
   the other a magician; but being full of his former persuasion of the
   ceasing of all ordinances and institutions, with the necessity of their
   restitution by immediate revelation from God, having got companions fit
   to harden him in his folly and presumption, he scorned all advice, and
   away he went to Prague. No sooner came he thither but his prophet had a
   revelation by an angel that Puccius must become Papist, his cheating
   companion having never been otherwise. Accordingly he turns Papist;
   begs pardon publicly for his deserting the Roman church, is reconciled
   by a priest, in whose society after he had a while continued, and
   laboured to pervert others to the same superstition with himself, he
   died a desperate magician. Have none in our days been led into the like
   maze? hath not Satan led some in the same circle, setting out from
   superstition to profaneness, passing through some zeal and earnestness
   in religion, rising to a contempt of ministry and ordinances, with an
   expectation of revelations and communion with angels? And how many have
   again sunk down into Popery, atheism, and horrible abominations, is
   known to all in this nation who think it their duty to inquire into the
   things of God. I have given this instance only to manifest that the old
   enemy of our salvation is not playing any new game of deceit and
   temptation, but such as he hath successfully acted in former
   generations. Let not us be ignorant of his deceits.

   By the way, a little farther to take in the consideration of men
   like-minded with him last mentioned: of those who denied all
   ordinances, and maintained such an utter loss and defection of all
   church state and order that it was impossible it should be restored
   without new apostles, evidencing their ministry by miracles, this was
   commonly the issue, that being pressed with this, that there was
   nothing needful to constitute a church of Christ but that there were a
   company of men believing in Jesus Christ, receiving the word of God,
   and taking it for their rule, they denied that indeed now there was or
   could be any faith in Jesus Christ, the ministers that should beget it
   being utterly ceased, and therefore it was advisable for men to serve
   God, to live justly and honestly, according to the dictates of the law
   of nature, and to omit all thoughts of Christ beyond an expectation of
   his sending persons hereafter to acquaint the world again with his
   worship.

   That this was the judgment of Matt. Radecius, his honoured friend,
   Socinus informs us; [59] though he mollifies his expression, p. 123,
   ascribing it to others. Whether many in our days are not insensibly
   fallen into the same abominations, a little time will discover. The
   main of the plea of the men of this persuasion in those days was taken
   from the example of the Israelites under that idolatrous apostasy
   wherein they were engaged by Jeroboam. "In the days of Elijah there
   were," said they, "seven thousand who joined not with the residue in
   their false worship and idolatry, but yet they never went about to
   gather, constitute, and set up a new church or churches, but remained
   in their scattered condition, keeping themselves as they could from the
   abominations of their brethren;" -- not considering that there is not
   the same reason of the Judaical and Christian churches, in that the
   carrying on of the worship of God among them was annexed to one tribe,
   yea, to one family in that tribe, and chiefly tied to one certain
   place, no public instituted worship, such as was to be the bond of
   communion for the church, being acceptable that was not performed by
   those persons in that place: so that it was utterly impossible for the
   godly in Israel then, or the ten tribes, to set up a new church-state,
   seeing they neither had the persons nor were possessed of the place,
   without which no such constitution was acceptable to God, as not being
   of his appointment. Under the gospel it is not so, either as to the one
   or other. All places being now alike, and all persons who are enabled
   thereunto having liberty to preach the word in the order by Christ
   appointed, the erecting of churches and the celebration of ordinances
   is recoverable, according to the mind of God, out of the greatest
   defection imaginable, whilst unto any persons there is a continuance of
   the word and Spirit.

   But to proceed with Socinus. Blandrata having got a great interest with
   the king of Poland and prince of Transylvania, as hath been declared,
   and making it his business to promote the Antitrinitarians, of what
   sort soever, being in Transylvania, where the men of his own
   abomination were exceedingly divided about the invocation and adoration
   of Jesus Christ, Franciscus David carrying all before him in an
   opposition thereunto (of which whole business I shall give a farther
   account afterward), he sends for Socinus, [60] who was known to them,
   and, from his dealing with Puccius, began to be famed for a disputant,
   to come to him into Transylvania, to dispute with and confute
   Franciscus David, in the end of the year 1578; where what success his
   dispute had, in the imprisonment and death of David, shall be afterward
   related.

   Being now fallen upon this controversy, which fell out before Faustus'
   going into Poland, before I proceed to his work and business there, I
   shall give a brief account of this business which I have now mentioned,
   and on which occasion he was sent for by Blandrata into Poland,
   referring the most considerable disputes he had about that difference
   to that place in the ensuing treatise where I shall treat of the
   invocation and worship of Christ.

   After way was once made in the minds of men for the farther work of
   Satan, by denying the deity of our blessed Lord Jesus, very many
   quickly grew to have more contemptible thoughts of him than those
   seemed to be willing they should from whose principles they professed,
   and indeed righteously, that their mean esteem of him did arise. Hence
   Franciscus David, Georgius Enjedinus, Christianus Franken, and sundry
   others, denied that Christ was to be worshipped with religious worship,
   or that he might be invocated and called upon. Against these Socinus,
   indeed, contended with all his might, professing that he would not
   account such as Christians who would not allow that Christ might be
   invocated and was to be worshipped; which that he was to be, he proved
   by undeniable testimonies of Scripture. But yet when himself came to
   answer their arguments, whereby they endeavoured to prove that a mere
   man (such as on both sides they acknowledged Christ to be) might not be
   worshipped with religious worship or divine adoration, the man, with
   all his craft and subtilty, was entangled, utterly confounded,
   silenced, slain with his own weapons, and triumphed over, as I shall
   afterward manifest in the account which I shall give of the disputation
   between him and Christianus Franken about this business: God in his
   righteous judgment so ordering things, that he who would not embrace
   the truth which he ought to have received should not be able to
   maintain and defend that truth which he did receive; for having, what
   in him lay, digged up the only foundation of the religious worship and
   adoration of Christ, he was altogether unable to keep the building
   upright. Nor did this fall out for want of ability in the man, no man
   under heaven being able on his false hypothesis to maintain the worship
   of Christ, but, as was said, merely by the just hand of God, giving him
   up to be punished by his own errors and darkness.

   Being hardened in the contempt of Christ by the success they had
   against Socinus and his followers, with whom they conversed and
   disputed, some of the men before mentioned stayed not with him at the
   affirming of him to be a mere man, nor yet where they began, building
   on that supposition that he was not to be worshipped, but proceeded yet
   farther, and affirmed that he was indeed a good man and sent of God,
   but yet he spake not by the spirit of prophecy, but so as that whatever
   was spoken by him and written by his apostles was to be examined by
   Moses and the prophets, whereto if it did not agree it was to be
   rejected: which was the sum of the first and second theses of
   Franciscus David, [61] in opposition to which Socinus gave in his
   judgment in certain antitheses to Christopher Barthoræus, prince of
   Transylvania, who had then cast David into prison for his blasphemy.
   [62]

   To give a little account, by the way, of the end of this man, with his
   contempt of the Lord Jesus:--

   In the year 1579, in the beginning of the month of June, he was cast
   into prison by the prince of Transylvania, and lived until the end of
   November. [63] That he was cast into prison by the instigation of
   Socinus himself and Blandrata, the testimonies are beyond exception;
   for this is not only recorded by Bellarmine and others of the Papists
   (to whose assertions, concerning any adversary with whom they have to
   do, I confess much credit is not to be given), but by others also of
   unquestionable authority. [64] This, indeed, Socinus denies, and would
   willingly impose the odium of it upon others; [65] but the truth is,
   considering the keenness and wrath of the man's spirit, and the
   thoughts he had of this miserable wretch, [66] it is more than probable
   that he was instrumental towards his death. The like apology does
   Smalcius make in his answer to Franzius about the carriage of the
   Samosatenians in that business of Franciscus David; where they accused
   one another of craft, treachery, bloody cruelty, treason. [67] Being
   cast into prison, the miserable creature fell into a frenetical
   distemper, through the revenging hand of God upon him, as Socinus
   confesseth himself. [68] In this miserable condition the devils (saith
   the historian) appeared unto him; whereupon he cried out, "Behold who
   expect me their companion in my journey," [69] whether really, or in
   his vexed, distempered imagination, disordered by his despairing mind,
   I determine not; but most certain it is that in that condition he
   expired, not in the year 1580, as Bellarmine, Weik, Ræmundus, and some
   of ours from them, inform us, but one year sooner, as he assures us who
   best knew. [70] And the consideration of this man's desperate apostasy
   and his companions' might be one cause that about this time sundry of
   the Antitrinitarians were converted, amongst whom was Daniel
   Bielenscius, a man afterward of good esteem. [71]

   But neither yet did Satan stop here, but improved the advantage given
   him by these men to the utter denying of Jesus Christ: for unto the
   principle of Christ's being not God, adding another of the same nature,
   that the prophecies of the Old Testament were all concerning temporal
   things, some amongst them at length concluded that there was no promise
   of any such person as Jesus Christ in the whole Old Testament; that the
   Messiah or king promised was only a king promised to the Jews, that
   they should have after the captivity, in case they did not offend but
   walk with God. "The kingdom," say they, "promised in the Old Testament,
   is a kingdom of this world only; but the kingdom which you assert to
   belong to Jesus of Nazareth was a kingdom not of this world, a heavenly
   kingdom, and so, consequently, not promised of God or from God;" [72]
   and therefore with him they would not have aught to do. This was the
   argument of Martin Seidelius, in his epistle to Socinus and his
   companions.

   What advantage is given to the like blasphemous imaginations with this,
   by such Judaizing annotations on the Old Testament as those of Grotius,
   time will evidence. Now, because this man's creed is such as is not to
   be paralleled, perhaps some may be contented to take it in his own
   words, which are as follow:--

   "Cæterum ut sciatis cujus sim religionis, quamvis id scripto meo quod
   habetis ostenderim, tamen hic breviter repetam. Et primum quidem
   doctrina de Messia, seu rege illo promisso, ad meam religionem nihil
   pertinet: ham rex ille tantum Judæis promissus erat, sicut et bona ilia
   Canaan. Sic etiam circumcisio, sacrificia, et reliquæ ceremoniæ Mosis
   ad me non pertinent, sed tantum populo Judaico promissa, data, et
   mandata sunt. Neque ista fuerunt cultus Dei apud Judæos, sed
   inserviebant cultui divino, et ad cultum divinum deducebant Judæos.
   Verus autem cultus Dei quem meam religionem appello, est decalogus, qui
   est æterna, et immutabilis voluntas Dei; qui decalogus ideo ad me
   pertinet, quia etiam mihi a Deo datus est, non quidem per vocem
   sonantem de coelo, sicut populo Judaico, at per creationem insita est
   menti meæ; quia autem insitus decalogus, per corruptionem naturæ humanæ
   et pravis consuetudinibus, aliqua ex parte obscuratus est, ideo ad
   illustrandum eum, adhibeo vocalem decalogum, qui vocalis decalogus,
   ideo etiam ad me, et ad omnes populos pertinet, quia cum insito nobis
   decalogo consentit, imo idem ille decalogus est. Hæc est mea sententia
   de Messia, seu rege illo promisso, et hæc est mea religio, quam coram
   vobis ingenue profiteor." -- Martin. Seidelius Olaviensis Silesius.

   To this issue did Satan drive the Socinian principles in this man and
   sundry others, even to a full and peremptory denial of the Lord that
   bought them. In answering this man, it fell out with Socinus much as it
   did with him in his disputation with Franken about the adoration and
   invocation of Jesus Christ: for granting Franken that Christ was but a
   mere man, he could no way evade his inference thence, that he was not
   to be invocated; so, granting Seidelius that the promises of the Old
   Testament were all temporal, he could not maintain against him that
   Jesus Christ, whose kingdom is heavenly, was the king and Messiah
   therein promised; for Faustus hath nothing to reply but that "God gives
   more than he promised, of which no man ought to complain." [73] Not
   observing that the question being not about the faithfulness of God in
   his promises, but about the thing promised, he gave away the whole
   cause, and yielded that Christ was not indeed the king and Messiah
   promised in the Old Testament.

   Of an alike opinion to this of Seidelius was he of whom we spake
   before, Franciscus David; who as to the kingdom of Christ delivered
   himself to this purpose: "That he was appointed to be a king of the
   Jews, and that God sent him into the world to receive his kingdom,
   which was to be earthly and civil, as the kingdoms of other kings; but
   the Jews rejected him and slew him, contrary to the purpose of God, who
   therefore took him from them and placed him in a quiet place, where he
   is not at all concerned in any of the things of the church, but is
   there in God's design a king, and he will one day send him again to
   Jerusalem, there to take upon him a kingdom, and to rule as the kings
   of this world do or have done." -- Thes. Francisei David de Adorat.
   Jes. Christi.

   The reminding of these abominations gives occasion, by the way, to
   complain of the carnal apprehensions of a kingdom of Christ, which too
   many amongst ourselves have filled their thoughts and expectations
   withal. For my part, I am persuaded that, before the end of the world,
   the Lord Jesus, by his word and Spirit, will multiply the seed of
   Abraham as the stars of heaven, bringing into one fold the remnant of
   Israel and the multitude of the Gentiles; and that his church shall
   have peace, after he hath judged and broken the stubborn adversaries
   thereof, and laid the kingdoms of the nations in a useful subserviency
   to his interest in this world; and that himself will reign most
   gloriously, by a spirit of light, truth, love, and holiness, in the
   midst of them: but that he hath a kingdom of another nature and kind to
   set up in the world than that heavenly kingdom which he hath peculiarly
   exercised ever since he was exalted and made a ruler and a saviour,
   that he should set up a dominion over men as men, and rule, either
   himself present or by his substitutes, as in a kingdom of this world,
   which is a kingdom neither of grace nor glory, I know it cannot be
   asserted without either the denial of his kingdom for the present, or
   that he is or hitherto hath been a king (which was the blasphemy of
   Franciscus David before mentioned), or the affirming that he hath, or
   is to have, upon the promise of God, two kingdoms of several sorts; of
   which in the whole word of God there is not the least tittle.

   To return: about the end of the year 1579, Faustus Socinus left
   Transylvania and went into Poland, which he chose for the stage whereon
   to act his design. [74] In what estate and condition the persons in
   Poland and Lithuania were who had fallen off from the faith of the holy
   Trinity was before declared. True it is, that before the coming of
   Socinus, Blandrata, by the help of Franciscus David, had brought over
   many of them from Sabellianism, and Tritheism, and Arianism, unto
   Samosatenianism, and a full, plain denial of the deity of Christ. [75]

   But yet with that Pelagian doctrine that Socinus came furnished withal
   unto them, they were utterly unacquainted, and were at no small
   difference, many of them, about the Deity. The condition of the first
   man to be mortal and obnoxious to death, that there was no original
   sin, that Christ was not a high-priest on the earth, that he made no
   satisfaction for sin, that we are not justified by his righteousness
   but our own, that the wicked shall be utterly confined and annihilated
   at the last day, with the rest of his opinions, which afterward he
   divulged, they were utterly strangers unto; as is evident from the
   contests he had about these things with some of them in their synods,
   and by writing, especially with Niemojevius, one of the chief patrons
   of their sect.

   In this condition of affairs, the man, being wise and subtile, obtained
   his purpose by the ensuing course of procedure:--

   1. He joined himself to none of their societies, because, being divided
   amongst themselves, he knew that by adhering to any one professedly, he
   should engage all the rest against him. That which he pretended most to
   favour, and for whose sake he underwent some contests, was the assembly
   at Racovia, which at first was collected by Gregorius Paulus, as hath
   been declared.

   From these his pretence for abstaining was, their rigid injunction of
   all to be rebaptized that entered into their fellowship and communion.
   But he who made it his design to gather the scattered Antitrinitarians
   into a body and a consistency in a religion among themselves saw
   plainly that the rigid insisting upon Anabaptism, which was the first
   principle of some of them, would certainly keep them at an
   unreconcilable distance. Wherefore he falls upon an opinion much better
   suited to his design, and maintained that baptism was only instituted
   for the initiation of them who from any other false religion were
   turned to the religion of Christ; but that it belonged not to Christian
   societies, nor to them that were born of Christian parents, and had
   never been of any other profession or religion, though they might use
   it, if they pleased, as an indifferent thing. And therefore he refused
   to join himself with the Racovians, unless upon this principle, that
   they would desist for the time to come from requiring any to be
   baptized that should join with them. In a short time he divided that
   meeting by this opinion, and at length utterly dissolved them, as to
   their old principles they first consented unto, and built the remainder
   of them, by the hand of Valentinus Smalcius, into his own mould and
   frame.

   The author of his life sets it forth as a great trial of his prudence,
   piety, and patience, that he was repulsed from the society at Racovia,
   and that with ignominy; [76] when the truth is, he absolutely refused
   to join with them, unless they would at once renounce their own
   principles and subscribe to his; which is as hard a condition as can be
   put upon any perfectly conquered enemy. This himself delivers at large
   on sundry occasions, especially insisting on and debating that business
   in his epistles to Simon Ronembergius and to Sophia Siemichovia. On
   this score did he write his disputation "De Baptismo Aquæ," with the
   vindication of it from the animadversions of A. D. (whom I suppose to
   be Andrew Dudithius), and of M. C., endeavouring with all his strength
   to prove that baptism is not an ordinance appointed for the use of
   Christians or their children, but only for such as were converted from
   Paganism or Mohammedanism; and this he did in the year 1580, two years
   after his coming into Poland, as he declares by the date of the
   disputation from Cracovia, at the close thereof. And in this persuasion
   he was so fixed, and laid such weight upon it, that after he had once
   before broken the assembly at Racovia, in his old days he encourages
   Valentinus Smalcius, [77] then their teacher, to break them again,
   because some of them tenaciously held their opinion; and for those who,
   as Smalcius informed him, would thereupon fall off to the reformed
   churches, he bids them go, and a good riddance of them. By this means,
   I say, he utterly broke up, and divided, and dissolved the meeting at
   Racovia, which was collected upon the principles before mentioned, that
   there remained none abiding to their first engagement but a few old
   women, as Squarcialupus [78] tells him, and as himself confesses in his
   answer for them to Palæologus. [79] By this course of behaviour, the
   man had these two advantages:-- (1.) He kept fair with all parties
   amongst them, and provoked not any by joining with them with whom they
   could not agree; so that all parties looked on him as their own, and
   were ready to make him the umpire of all their differences, by which he
   had no small advantage of working them all to his own principles. (2.)
   He was less exposed to the fury of the Papists, which he greatly feared
   (loving well the things of this world), than he would have been had he
   joined himself to any visible church profession; and, indeed, his
   privacy of living was a great means of his security.

   2. His second great advantage was that he was a scholar, and was able
   to defend and countenance them against their opposers, the most of them
   being miserably weak and unlearned. One of their best defensatives,
   before his joining with them, was a clamour against logic and learning,
   as himself confesseth in some of his epistles. Now, this is not only
   evident by experience, but the nature of the thing itself makes it
   manifest that so it will be: whereas men of low and weak abilities fall
   into by-persuasions in religion, as they generally at first prevail by
   clamours and all sorts of reproaches cast on learning and learned men,
   yet if God in his providence at any time, to heighten the temptation,
   suffer any person of learning and ability to fall in amongst and with
   them, he is presently their head and ruler without control. Some
   testimony hereof our own days have afforded, and I wish we may not have
   more examples given us. Now, how far he availed himself of this
   advantage, the consideration of them with whom he had to do, of the
   esteem they had of his abilities, and the service he did them thereby,
   will acquaint us.

   [As] for the leaders of them, they were for the most part unlearned,
   and so unable to defend their opinions in any measure against a
   skillful adversary. Blandrata, their great patron, was not able to
   express himself in Latin, but by the help of Statorius, who had some
   learning, but no judgment; [80] and therefore, upon his difference with
   Franciscus David in Transylvania, he was forced to send for Socinus out
   of Helvetia to manage the disputation with him. And what kind of cattle
   those were with whom he had to do at Cracovia as well as Racovia, is
   manifest from the epistle of Simon Ronembergius, one of the leaders and
   elders of that which they called their "church," which is printed, with
   Socinus' answer unto it. I do not know that ever in my life I saw, for
   matter and form, sense and language, any thing so simple and foolish,
   so ridiculously senseless and incoherent, unless it were one or two in
   our own days, which with this deserve an eminent place "inter epistolas
   obscurorum virorum." And therefore Socinus justly feared that his party
   would have the worst in disputes, as he acknowledges it befell Licinius
   in his conference with Smiglecius at Novograde, [81] and could not
   believe Ostorodius that he had such success as he boasted in Germany
   with Fabritius; [82] and tells us himself a story of some pastors of
   their churches in Lithuania, who were so ignorant and simple that they
   knew not that Christ was to be worshipped. [83] What a facile thing it
   was for a man of his parts, abilities, and learning, to obtain a
   kingdom amongst such as these is easily guessed. He complains, indeed,
   of his own lost time in his young days, by the instigation of the
   devil, and says that it made him weary of his life to think of it, when
   he had once set up his thoughts in seeking honour and glory by being
   the head and master of a sect, as Ignatius the father of the Jesuits
   did [84] (with whom, as to this purpose, he is compared all along by
   the gentleman that wrote his life); yet it is evident that his learning
   and abilities were such as easily promoted him to the dictatorship
   among them with whom he had to do.

   It may, then, be easily imagined what kind of esteem such men as those
   would have of so great an ornament and glory of their religion, who at
   least was with them in that wherein they dissented from the rest of
   Christians.

   Not only after his death, when they set him forth as the most
   incomparable man of his time, but in his own life and to himself, as I
   know not what excellent person, [85] -- that he had a mind suited for
   the investigation of truth, was a philosopher, an excellent orator, an
   eminent divine, that for the Latin tongue especially he might contend
   with any of the great wits of Europe, they told him to his face; such
   thoughts had they generally of him. It is, then, no wonder they gave
   themselves up to his guidance. Hence Smalcius wrote unto him to consult
   about the propriety of the Latin tongue, and in his answer to him he
   excuses it as a great crime that he had used a reciprocal relative
   where there was no occasion for it. [86]

   And to make it more evident how they depended on him, on this account
   of his ability for instructions, when he had told Ostorodius an answer
   to an objection of the Papists, the man having afterward forgot it,
   sends to him again to have his lesson over once more, that he might
   remember it. [87]

   And therefore, as if he had been to deal with school-boys, he would
   tell his chief companions that he had found out and discovered such or
   such a thing in religion, but would not tell them until they had tried
   themselves, and therefore was afraid lest he should through unawares
   have told it to any of them; [88] upon one of which adventures,
   Ostorodius making bold to give in his conception, he does little better
   than tell him he is a blockhead. [89] Being in this repute amongst
   them, and exercising such a dominion in point of abilities and
   learning, to prevail the more upon them, he was perpetually ready to
   undertake their quarrels, which themselves were not able with any
   colour to maintain. Hence most of his books were written, and his
   disputations engaged in, upon the desire of one assembly, synod, or
   company of them or other, as I could easily manifest by particular
   instances. And by this means got he no small advantage to insinuate his
   own principles; for whereas the men greedily looked after and freely
   entertained the things which were professedly written in their defence,
   he always wrought in together therewith something of his own peculiar
   heresy, that poison might be taken down with that which was most
   pleasing. Some of the wisest of them, indeed, as Niemojevius,
   discovered the fraud, who, upon his answer to Andræus Volanus,
   commending what he had written against the deity of Christ, which they
   employed him in, falls foul upon him for his delivering in the same
   treatise that Christ was not a priest whilst he was upon the earth;
   [90] which one abominable figment lies at the bottom of his whole
   doctrine of the justification of a sinner. The case is the same about
   his judgment concerning the invocation of Christ, which was, "That we
   might do it, but it was not necessary from any precept or otherwise
   that so we should do."

   And this was nine years after his coming into Poland, as appears from
   the date of that epistle; so long was he in getting his opinions to be
   entertained among his friends. But though this man were a little wary,
   and held out some opposition unto him, yet multitudes of them were
   taken with this snare, and freely drank down the poison they loathed,
   being tempered with that which they had a better liking to. But this
   being discovered, he let the rest of them know that though he was
   entreated to write that book by the Racovians, and did it in their
   name, [91] yet, because he had published somewhat of his own private
   opinions therein, they might if they pleased deny, yea, and forswear,
   that they were written by their appointment.

   And this was with respect to his doctrine about the satisfaction of
   Christ, which, as he says, he heard they were coming over unto; and it
   is evident from what he writes elsewhere to Balcerovicius that he
   begged this employment of writing against Volanus, it being agreed by
   them that he should write nothing but by public consent, because of the
   novelties which he broached every day. By this readiness to appear and
   write in their defence, and so commending his writing to them on that
   account, it is incredible how he got ground upon them, and won them
   over daily to the residue of his abominations, which they had not
   received.

   3. To these add, as another advantage to win upon that people, the
   course he had fixed on in reference to others; which was, to own as
   his, and of his party of the church, all persons whatever that, on any
   pretence whatever, opposed the doctrine of the Trinity and forsook the
   reformed church. Hence he dealt with men as his brethren, friends, and
   companions, who scarcely retained any thing of Christians, some nothing
   at all; as Martin Seidelius, who denied Christ; with Philip Buccel, who
   denied all difference of good and evil in the actions of men; with
   Erasmus Johannes, an Arian; with Matthias Radecius, who denied that any
   could believe in Christ without new apostles; -- indeed, with all or
   any sorts of men whatever that would but join with him, or did consent
   unto the opposition of the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was
   the principal work which he engaged in.

   4. Unto these and the like advantages the man added all the arts and
   subtilties, all the diligence and industry, that were any way tending
   to his end. Some of his artifices and insinuations, indeed, were
   admirable, though to them who now review them in cold blood, without
   recalling to mind the then state of things, they may seem of another
   complexion. [92]

   By these and the like means, though he once despaired of ever getting
   his opinions received amongst them, as he professeth, yet in the long
   continuance of twenty-four years (so long he lived in Poland), with the
   help of Valentinus Smalcius, Volkelius, and some few others, who wholly
   fell in with him, he at length brought them all into subjection to
   himself, and got all his opinions enthroned, and his practice taken
   almost for a rule; so that whereas in former days they accused him for
   a covetous wretch, one that did nothing but give his mind to scrape up
   money, and were professedly offended with his putting money to usury,
   [93] for his full justification, Ostorodius and Voidovius, in the close
   of the compendium of their religion which they brought into Holland,
   profess that their "churches did not condemn usury, so that it were
   exercised with moderation and without oppression." [94]

   I thought to have added a farther account, in particular, of the man's
   craft and subtilty; of his several ways for the instilling of his
   principles and opinions; of his personal temper, wrath, and anger, and
   multiplying of words in disputes; of the foils he received in sundry
   disputations with men of his own antitrinitarian infidelity; of his aim
   at glory and renown, expressed by the Polonian gentleman who wrote his
   life; his losses and troubles, which were not many, -- with all which,
   and the like concernments of the man and his business in that
   generation, by the perusal of all that he wrote, and of much that hath
   been written against him, with what is extant of the conferences and
   disputations, synods and assemblies of those days, I have some little
   acquaintance; -- but being not convinced of much usefulness in my so
   doing, I shall willingly spare my labour. Thus much was necessary, that
   we might know the men and their conversation who have caused so much
   trouble to the Christian world; in which work, having the assistance of
   that atheism and those corrupted principles which are in the hearts of
   all by nature, without the infinite rich mercy of God sparing a sinful
   world as to this judgment, for his elect's sake, they will undoubtedly
   proceed.

   Leaving him, then, in the possession of his conquest, Tritheists,
   Sabellians, Arians, Eunomians, with the followers of Francis David,
   being all lost and sunk, and Socinians standing up in the room of them
   all, looking a little upon what ensued, I shall draw from the
   consideration of the persons to their doctrines, as at first proposed.

   After the death of Socinus, his cause was strongly carried on by those
   whom in his life he had formed to his own mind and judgment; among whom
   Valentinus Smalcius, Hieronymus Moscorovius, Johannes Volkelius,
   Christopherus Ostorodius, were the chief. To Smalcius he wrote eleven
   epistles, that are extant, professing his great expectations of him,
   extolling his learning and prudence. He afterward wrote the Racovian
   Catechism, compiling it out of Socinus' works; many answers and replies
   to and with Smiglecius the Jesuit, and Franzius the Lutheran; a book of
   the divinity of Christ, with sundry others; and was a kind of professor
   among them at Racovia. The writings of the rest of them are also
   extant. To him succeeded Crellius, a man of more learning and modesty
   than Smalcius, and of great industry for the defence of his heresy. His
   defence of Socinus against Grotius' treatise, "De Causis Mortis
   Christi, de Effectu SS.," his comments and ethics, declare his
   abilities and industry in his way. After him arose Jonas
   Schlichtingius, a man no whit behind any of the rest for learning and
   diligence, as in his comments and disputations against Meisnerus is
   evident. As the report is, he was burned by the procurement of the
   Jesuits, some four years ago, that they might be sure to have the blood
   of all sorts of men found upon them. What advantage they have obtained
   thereby time will show. I know that generation of men retort upon us
   the death of Servetus at Geneva; but the case was far different.
   Schlichtingius lived in his own country, and conversed with men of his
   own persuasion, who in a succession had been so before he was born:
   Servetus came out of Spain on purpose to disturb and seduce them who
   knew nothing of his abominations. Schlichtingius disputed his heresy
   without reproaching or blaspheming God willingly, under pretence of
   denying the way and worship of his adversaries: Servetus stuffed all
   his discourses with horrid blasphemies. Beza tells us that he called
   the Trinity tricipitem Cerberum, and wrote that Moses was a ridiculous
   impostor, Beza, Ep. i.; and there are passages cited out of his book of
   the Trinity (which I have not seen) that seem to have as much of the
   devil in them as any thing that ever yet was written or spoken by any
   of the sons of men. If, saith he, Christ be the Son of God, "debuissent
   ergo dicere, quod Deus habebat uxorem quandam spiritualem, vel quod
   solus ipse masculus femineus aut hermaphroditus, simul erat pater et
   mater, nam ratio vocabuli non patitur, ut quis dicatur sine matre
   pater: et si Logos filius erat, natus ex patre sine matre; dic mihi
   quomodo peporit eum, per ventrem an per latus."

   To this height of atheism and blasphemy had Satan wrought up the spirit
   of the man; so that I must say he is the only person in the world, that
   I ever read or heard of, that ever died upon the account of religion,
   in reference to whom the zeal of them that put him to death may be
   acquitted. But of these things God will judge. Socinus says he died
   calling on Christ; those that were present say quite the contrary, and
   that in horror he roared out misericordia to the magistrates, but
   nothing else. But arcana Deo.

   Of these men last named, their writings and endeavours for the
   propagation of their opinions, others having written already, I shall
   forbear. Some of note amongst them have publicly recanted and renounced
   their heresy, as Vogelius and Peuschelius; whose retractations are
   answered by Smalcius. Neither shall I add much as to their present
   condition. They have as yet many churches in Poland and Transylvania;
   and have their superintendents, after the manner of Germany.
   Regenvolscius tells us that all the others are sunk and lost, only the
   Socinians remain; [95] the Arians, Sabellians, David Georgians, with
   the followers of Franciscus David, being all gone over to the
   confession of Socinus: which makes me somewhat wonder at that of
   Johannes Lætus, who affirms that about the year 1619, in a convention
   of the states in Poland, those who denied that Christ ought to be
   invocated (which were the followers of Franciscus David, Christianus
   Franken, and Palæologus) pleaded that the liberty that was granted to
   Antitrinitarians was intended for them, and not for the Socinians; and
   the truth is, they had footing in Poland before ever the name of
   Socinus was there known, though he afterward insults upon them, and
   says that they most impudently will have themselves called Christians
   when they are not so. [96]

   But what numbers they are in those parts of the world, how the poison
   is drunk in by thousands in the Papacy, by what advantages it hath
   [insinuated], and continues to insinuate itself into multitudes living
   in the outward profession of the reformed churches, what progress it
   makes and what ground it gets in our native country every day, I had
   rather bewail than relate. This I am compelled to say, that unless the
   Lord, in his infinite mercy, lay an awe upon the hearts of men, to keep
   them in some captivity to the simplicity and mystery of the gospel who
   now strive every day to exceed one another in novel opinions and
   philosophical apprehensions of the things of God, I cannot but fear
   that this soul-destroying abomination will one day break in as a flood
   upon us.

   I shall only add something of the occasions and advantages that these
   men took and had for the renewing and propagation of their heresy, and
   draw to a close of this discourse.

   Not to speak of the general and more remote causes of these and all
   other soul-destroying errors, or the darkness, pride, corruption, and
   wilfullness of men; the craft, subtilty, envy, and malice of Satan; the
   just revenging hand of God, giving men up to a spirit of delusion, that
   they might believe lies, because they delighted not in the truth, -- I
   shall only remark one considerable occasion or stumbling-block at which
   they fell and drank in the poison, and one considerable advantage that
   they had for the propagation of what they had so fallen into.

   Their great stumbling-block I look upon to be the horrible corruption
   and abuse of the doctrine of the Trinity in the writings of the
   schoolmen, and the practice of the devotionists among the Papists. With
   what desperate boldness, atheistical curiosity, wretched inquiries and
   babbling, the schoolmen have polluted the doctrine of the Trinity, and
   gone off from the simplicity of the gospel in this great mystery, is so
   notoriously known that I shall not need to trouble you with instances
   for the confirmation of the observation. This the men spoken of (being
   the most, if not all of them, brought up in the Papacy) stumbled at.
   They saw the doctrine concerning that God whom they were to worship
   rendered unintelligible, curious, intricate,:involved in terms and
   expressions not only barbarous in themselves, and not used in
   Scripture, but insignificant, horrid, and remote from the reason of
   men: which, after some struggling, set them at liberty from under the
   bondage of those notions; and when they should have gone to "the law
   and to the testimony" for their information, Satan turned them aside to
   their own reasonings and imaginations, where they stumbled and fell.
   And yet of the forms and expressions of their schoolmen are the Papists
   so zealous, as that whoever departs from them in any kind is presently
   an antitrinitarian heretic. The dealings of Bellarmine, Genebrard,
   Possevine, and others, with Calvin, are known. One instance may be
   taken of their ingenuity: Bellarmine, in his book, "De Christo," lays
   it to the charge of Bullinger, that in his book, "De Scripturæ et
   Ecclesiæ Authoritate," he wrote that there were three persons in the
   Deity, "non statu, sed gradu, non subsistentia, sod forma, non
   potestate, sod specie differentes;" on which he exclaims that the
   Arians themselves never spake more wickedly: and yet these are the very
   words of Tertullian against Praxeas; which, I confess, are warily to be
   interpreted. But by this their measuring of truth by the forms received
   by tradition from their fathers, neglecting and forsaking the
   simplicity of the gospel, that many stumbled and fell is most evident.

   Schlusselburgius, in his wonted respect and favour unto the Calvinists,
   tells us that from them and their doctrine was the occasion
   administered unto this new abomination; also, that never any turned
   Arian but he was first a Calvinist: which he seems to make good by a
   letter of Adam Neuserus, who, as he saith, from a Sacramentarian turned
   Arian, and afterward a Mohammedan, and was circumcised at
   Constantinople. "This man," says he, "in a letter from Constantinople
   to Doctor Gerlachius, tells him that none turned Arians but those that
   were Calvinists first; and therefore he that would take heed of
   Arianism had best beware of Calvinism." [97] I am very unwilling to
   call any man's credit into question who relates a matter of fact,
   unless undeniable evidence enforce me, because it cannot be done
   without an imputation of the foulest crime; I shall therefore take
   leave to ask, --

   1. What credit is to be given to the testimony of this man, who, upon
   Conradus' own report, was circumcised, turned Mohammedan, and had
   wholly renounced the truth which he once professed? For my part, I
   should expect from such a person nothing but what was maliciously
   contrived for the prejudice of the truth; and therefore suppose he
   might raise this on purpose to strengthen and harden the Lutherans
   against the Calvinists, whom he hated most, because that they professed
   the truth which he had renounced, and that true knowledge of Christ and
   his will which now he hated; and this lie of his he looked on as an
   expedient for the hardening of the Lutherans in their error, and
   helping them with a stone to cast at the Calvinists.

   2. Out of what kindness was it that this man bare to Gerlachius and his
   companions, that he gives them this courteous admonition to beware of
   Calvinism? Is it any honour to Gerlachius, Conradus himself, or any
   other Lutheran, that an apostate, an abjurer of Christian religion,
   loved them better than he did the Calvinists? What person this Adam
   Neuserus was, and what the end of him was, we have an account given by
   Maresius from a manuscript history of Altingius. From Heidelberg, being
   suspected of a conspiracy with one Sylvanus, who for it was put to
   death, he fled into Poland, thence to Constantinople, where he turned
   Mohammedan, and was circumcised, and after a while fell into such
   miserable horror and despair, that with dreadful yellings and clamours
   he died; so that the Turks themselves confess that they never heard of
   a more horrid, detestable, and tragical end of any man; whereupon they
   commonly called him Satan Ogli, or the son of the devil. And so, much
   good may it do Conradus, with his witness.

   3. But what occasion, I pray, does Calvinism give to Arianism, that the
   one should be taken heed of if we intend to avoid the other? What
   offence does it give to men inquiring after the truth, to make them
   stumble on their abominations? What doctrine doth it maintain that
   should prepare them for it? But no man is bound to burden himself with
   more than he can carry, and therefore all such inquiries
   Schlusselburgius took no notice of.

   The truth is, many of the persons usually instanced in as apostates
   from Calvinism to Arianism were such as, leaving Italy and other parts
   of the pope's dominion, came to shelter themselves where they expected
   liberty and opportunity of venting their abomination among the reformed
   churches, and joined themselves with them in outward profession, most
   of them, as afterward appeared, being thoroughly infected with the
   errors against the Trinity and about the Godhead before they left the
   Papacy, where they stumbled and fell.

   In the practice of the "church," as it is called, wherein they were
   bred, they nextly saw the horrible idolatry that was countenanced in
   abominable pictures of the Trinity, and the worship yielded to them;
   which strengthened and fortified their minds against such gross
   conceptions of the nature of God as by those pictures were exhibited.

   Hence, when they had left the Papacy and set up their opposition to the
   blessed Trinity, in all their books they still made mention of those
   idols and pictures, speaking of them as the gods of those that
   worshipped the Trinity. This instance makes up a good part of their
   book, "De Falsa et Vera Cognitione Unius Dei, Patris, Filii, et
   Spiritus Sancti," written in the name of the ministers of the churches
   in Sarmatia and Transylvania; a book full of reproach and blasphemies.
   But this, I say, was another occasion of stumbling to those miserable
   wretches. They knew what thoughts the men of their communication had of
   God, by the pictures made of him, and the worship they yielded to them,
   -- they knew how abhorrent to the very principles of reason it was that
   God should be such as by them represented; and therefore set themselves
   at liberty (or rather gave up themselves to the service of Satan) to
   find out another god whom they might worship.

   Neither are they a little confirmed to this day in their errors by
   sundry principles which, under the Roman apostasy, got footing in the
   minds of men professing the name of Jesus Christ; particularly, they
   sheltered themselves from the sword of the word of God, evidencing the
   deity of Christ by ascribing to him divine adoration, by the shield of
   the Papists' doctrine, that those who are not gods by nature may be
   adored, worshipped, and invocated.

   Now, that to this day the Papists continue in the same idolatry (to
   touch that by the way), I shall give you, for your refreshment, a copy
   of a verse or two, whose poetry does much outgo the old,


   "O crux spes unica!

   Auge piis constantiam,

   Hoc passionis tempore,

   Reisque dona veniam;"

   and whose blasphemy comes not at all short of it. The first is of
   Clarus Bonarus the Jesuit, lib. iii. Amphitrial. Honor. lib. iii. cap.
   ult. ad Divinam Hallensem et Puerum Jesum, as followeth:--


   "Hæreo lac inter meditans, interque cruorem;

   Inter delicias uberis et lateris.

   Et dico (si forte oculus super ubera tendo),

   Diva parens mammæ gaudia posco tuæ.

   Sed dico (si deinde oculos in vulnera verto),

   O Jesu lateris gaudia male tui.

   Rem scio, prensabo si fas erit ubera dextra,

   Læva prensabo vulnera si dabitur.

   Lac matris miscere vole cum sanguine nati;

   Non possem antidote nobiliore frui.

   Vulnera restituant turpem uleeribus mendicum,

   Testa cui saniem radere sola potest.

   Ubera reficient Ismaelem sitientem,

   Quem Sara non patitur, quem neque nutrit Agar.

   Ista mihi, ad pestem procul et procul expungendam;

   Ista mini ad longas evalitura febres.

   Ira vomit flammas, fumatque libidinis Ætna;

   Suffocare queo sanguine, lacte queo.

   Livor inexpleta rubigine sævit in artus;

   Detergere queo lacte, cruore queo:

   Vanus honos me perpetua prurigine tentat:

   Exsaturare queo sanguine, lacte queo.

   Ergo parens et nate, meis advertite votis

   Lac peto, depereo sanguinem, utrumque volo.

   O sitio tamen! O vocem sitis intercludit!

   Nate cruore, sitim comprime lacte parens.

   Dic matri, meus hic frater sitit, optima mater,

   Vise fonte tuo promere, deque meo.

   Dic nato, tuus hie frater mi mellee fili

   Captivus monstrat vincula, lytron habes.

   Ergo Redemptorem monstra to jure vocari,

   Nobilior reliquis si tibi sanguis inest.

   Tuque parens monstra, matrem to jure vocari,

   Ubera si reliquis divitiora geris.

   O quando lactabor ab ubere, vulnere pascar?

   Deliciisque fruar, mamma latusque tuis."

   The other is of Franciscus de Mendoza, in Viridario Utriusque
   Eruditionis, lib. ii. prob. 2, as ensueth:--


   "Ubera me matris, nati me vulnera pascunt

   Scilicet hæc animi sunt medicina mei,

   Nam mihi dum lachrymas amor elicit ubera sugo

   Rideat ut dulci moestus amore dolor.

   At me pertentant dum gaudia, vulnera lambo

   Ut me læta pio mista dolore juvent.

   Vulnera sic nati, sic ubera sugo parentis

   Securæ ut variæ sint mihi forte vices.

   Quis sine lacte precor, vel quis sine sanguine vivat?

   Lacte tuo genetrix, sanguine hate tuo.

   Sit lac pro ambrosia, suavi pro hectare sanguis

   Sic me perpetuum vulnus et uber alit."

   And this their idolatry is objected to them by Socinus, [98] who
   marvels at the impudence of Bellarmine closing his books of
   controversies (as is the manner of the men of that Society) with "Laus
   Deo, virginique matri Mariæ," wherein, as he says (and he says it
   truly), divine honour with God is ascribed to the blessed Virgin.

   The truth is, I see not any difference between that dedication of
   himself and his work, by Redemptus Baranzano the priest, in these
   words, "Deo, Virglnique Matri, Sancto Paulo, Bruno, Alberto, Redempto,
   Francisco, Clarke, Joannæ, Catharinæ Senensi, divisque omnibus, quos
   peculiari cultu honorare desidero, omnis meus labour consecratus sit"
   (Baranzan. Nov. Opin. Physic. Diglad.), and that of the Athenians, by
   the advice of Epimenides Theois Asias kai Europes kai Libues, Theo
   agnosto kai Xeno both of them being suitable to the counsel of
   Pythagoras:--


   Athanatous men prota theous nomo hos diakeitai

   Tima kai sebou horkon epeith heroas aganous

   Tous te katachthonious oebe daimonas hennoma rhezon

   Let them be sure to worship all sorts, that they may not miss. And by
   these means, amongst others, hath an occasion of stumbling and
   hardening been given to these poor souls.

   As to the propagation of their conceptions, they had the advantage not
   only of an unsettled time, as to the civil government of the nations of
   the world, most kingdoms and commonweals in Europe undergoing in that
   age considerable mutations and changes (a season wherein commonly the
   envious man hath taken opportunity to sow his tares); but also, men
   being set at liberty from the bondage under which they were kept in the
   Papacy, and from making the tradition of their fathers the rule of
   their worship and walking, were found indeed to have, upon abiding
   grounds, no principles of religion at all, and therefore were earnest
   in the inquiry after something that they might fix upon. What to avoid
   they knew, but what to close withal they knew not; and therefore it is
   no wonder if, among so many (I may say) millions of persons as in those
   days there were that fell off from the Papacy, some thousands perhaps
   (much more scores) might, in their inquirings, from an extreme of
   superstition run into another almost of atheism.

   Such was the estate of things and men in those days wherein
   Socinianism, or the opposition to Christ of this latter edition, set
   forth in the world. Among the many that were convinced of the
   abominations of Popery before they were well fixed in the truth, some
   were deceived by the cunning sleight of some few men that lay in wait
   to deceive. What event and issue an alike state and condition of things
   and persons hath gone forth unto in the places and days wherein we live
   is known to all; and that the saints of God may be warned by these
   things is this addressed to them. To what hath been spoken I had
   thought, for a close of this discourse, to have given an account of the
   learning that these men profess, and the course of their studies, of
   their way of disputing, and the advantages they have therein; to have
   instanced in some of their considerable sophisms, and subtile
   depravations of Scripture, as also to have given a specimen of
   distinctions and answers, which may be improved to the discovering and
   slighting of their fallacies in the most important heads of religion:
   but being diverted by new and unexpected avocations, I shall refer
   these and other considerations unto a prodromus for the use of younger
   students who intend to look into these controversies.

   And these are the persons with whom we have to deal, these their ways
   and progress in the world. I shall now briefly subjoin some advantages
   they have had, something of the way and method wherein they have
   proceeded, for the diffusing of their poison, with some general
   preservatives against the infection, and draw to a close of this
   discourse.

   1. At the first entrance upon their undertaking, some of them made no
   small advantage, in dealing with weak and unwary men, by crying out
   that the terms of trinity, person, essence, hypostatical union,
   communication of properties, and the like, were not found in the
   Scripture, and therefore were to be abandoned.

   With the colour of this plea, they once prevailed so far on the
   churches in Transylvania as that they resolved and determined to
   abstain from the use of those words; but they quickly perceived that
   though the words were not of absolute necessity to express the things
   themselves to the minds of believers, yet they were so to defend the
   truth from the opposition and craft of seducers, and at length
   recovered themselves, by the advice of Beza: [99] yea, and Socinus
   himself doth not only grant but prove that in general this is not to be
   imposed on men, that the doctrine they assert is contained in Scripture
   in so many words, seeing it sufficeth that the thing itself pleaded for
   be contained therein. [100] To which purpose I desire the learned
   reader to peruse his words, seeing he gives an instance of what he
   speaks somewhat opposite to a grand notion of his disciple, with whom I
   have chiefly to do; yea, and the same person rejects the plea of his
   companions, of the not express usage of the terms wherein the doctrine
   of the Trinity is delivered in the Scripture, as weak and frivolous.
   [101] And this hath made me a little marvel at the precipitate,
   undigested conceptions of some, who, in the midst of the flames of
   Socinianism kindling upon us on every side, would (contrary to the
   wisdom and practice of all antiquity, no one assembly in the world
   excepted) tie us up to a form of confession composed of the bare words
   of the Scripture, in the order wherein they are placed. If we profess
   to believe that Christ is God blessed for ever, and the Socinians tell
   us, "True, but he is a God by office, not by nature," is it not lawful
   for us to say, "Nay, but he is God, of the same nature, substance, and
   essence with his Father?" If we shall say that Christ is God, one with
   the Father, and the Sabellians shall tell us, "True, they are every way
   one, and in all respects, so that the whole Deity was incarnate," is it
   not lawful for us to tell them, that though he be one in nature and
   essence with his Father, yet he is distinct from him in person? And the
   like instances may be given for all the expressions wherein the
   doctrine of the blessed Trinity is delivered. The truth is, we have
   sufficient ground for these expressions in the Scripture as to the
   words, and not only the things signified by them: the nature of God we
   have, Gal. iv. 8; the person of the Father, and the Son distinct from
   it, Heb. i. 3; the essence of God, Exod. iii. 14, Rev. i. 4; the
   Trinity, 1 John v. 7; the Deity, Col. ii. 9.

   2. Their whole business, in all their books and disputations, is to
   take upon themselves the part of answerers, so cavilling and making
   exception, not caring at all what becomes of any thing in religion, so
   they may with any colour avoid the arguments wherewith they are
   pressed. Hence almost all their books, unless it be some few short
   catechisms and confessions, are only answers and exceptions to other
   men's writings. Beside the fragments of a catechism or two, Socinus
   himself wrote very little but of this kind; so do the rest. How heavy
   and dull they are in asserting may be seen in Volkelius' Institutions;
   and here, whilst they escape their adversaries, they are desperately
   bold in their interpretations of Scripture, though, for the most part,
   it suffices [them to say] that what is urged against them is not the
   sense of the place, though they themselves can assign no sense at all
   to it. I could easily give instances in abundance to make good this
   observation concerning them, but I shall not mention what must
   necessarily be insisted on in the ensuing discourse. Their answers are,
   "This may otherwise be expounded;" "It may otherwise be understood;"
   "The word may have another signification in another place."

   3. The greatest triumphs which they set up in their own conceits are,
   when by any ways they possess themselves of any usual maxim that passes
   current amongst men, being applied to finite, limited, created things,
   or any acknowledged notion in philosophy, and apply it to the infinite,
   uncreated, essence of God; than which course of proceeding nothing,
   indeed, can be more absurd, foolish, and contrary to sound reason. That
   God and man, the Creator and creature, that which is absolutely
   infinite and independent, and that which is finite, limited, and
   dependent, should be measured by the same rules, notions, and
   conceptions, unless it be by way of eminent analogy, which will not
   further their design at all, is most fond and senseless. And this one
   observation is sufficient to arm us against all their profound disputes
   about "essence," "personality," and the like.

   4. Generally, as we said, in the pursuit of their design and carrying
   it on, they begin in exclaiming against the usual words wherein the
   doctrines they oppose are taught and delivered. "They are not Scripture
   expressions," etc.; "For the things themselves, they do not oppose
   them, but they think them not so necessary as some suppose," etc.
   Having got some ground by this on the minds of men, great stress is
   immediately laid on this, "That a man may be saved though he believe
   not the doctrine of the Trinity, the satisfaction of Christ, etc., so
   that he live holily, and yield obedience to the precepts of Christ; so
   that it is mere madness and folly to break love and communion about
   such differences." By this engine I knew, not long since, a choice
   society of Christians, through the cunning sleight of one lying in wait
   to deceive, disturbed, divided, broken, and in no small part of it
   infected. If they once get this advantage, and have thereby weakened
   the love and valuation of the truth with any, they generally, through
   the righteous judgment of God in giving up men of light and vain
   spirits to the imaginations of their own hearts, overthrow their faith,
   and lead them captive at their pleasure.

   5. I thought to have insisted, in particular, on their particular ways
   of insinuating their abominations, of the baits they lay, the devices
   they have, their high pretences to reason, and holiness in their lives,
   or honesty; as also, to have evinced, by undeniable evidences, that
   there are thousands in the Papacy and among the Reformed Churches that
   are wholly baptized into their vile opinions and infidelity, though,
   for the love of their temporal enjoyments, which are better to them
   than their religion, they profess it not; as also, how this persuasion
   of theirs hath been the great door whereby the flood of atheism which
   is broken in upon the world, and which is almost always professed by
   them who would be accounted the wits of the times, is come in upon the
   nations; farther, to have given general answers and distinctions
   applicable to the most if not all of the considerable arguments and
   objections wherewith they impugn the truth: but referring all these to
   my general considerations for the study of controversies in divinity,
   with some observations that may be preservatives against their poison,
   I shall speedily acquit you from the trouble of this address. Give me
   leave, then, in the last place (though unfit and unworthy), to give
   some general cautions to my fellow-labourers and students in divinity
   for the freeing our souls from being tainted with these abominations,
   and I have done:--

   1. Hold fast the form of wholesome words and sound doctrine: know that
   there are other ways of peace and accommodation with dissenters than by
   letting go the least particle of truth. When men would accommodate
   their own hearts to love and peace, they must not double with their
   souls, and accommodate the truth of the gospel to other men's
   imaginations. Perhaps some will suggest great things of going a middle
   way in divinity, between dissenters; but what is the issue, for the
   most part, of such proposals? After they have, by their middle way,
   raised no less contentions than was before between the extremes (yea,
   when things before were in some good measure allayed), the
   accommodators themselves, through an ambitious desire to make good and
   defend their own expedients, are insensibly carried over to the party
   and extreme to whom they thought to make a condescension unto; and, by
   endeavouring to blanch their opinions, to make them seem probable, they
   are engaged to the defence of their consequences before they are aware.
   Amyraldus (whom I look upon as one of the greatest wits of these days)
   will at present go a middle way between the churches of France and the
   Arminians. What hath been the issue? Among the churches, divisions,
   tumult, disorder; among the professors and ministers, revilings, evil
   surmisings; to the whole body of the people, scandals and offences; and
   in respect of himself, evidence of daily approaching nearer to the
   Arminian party, until, as one of them saith of him, he is not far from
   their kingdom of heaven. But is this all? Nay, but Grotius, Episcopius,
   Curcellæus, [102] etc. (quanta nomina!) with others, must go a middle
   way to accommodate with the Socinians; and all that will not follow are
   rigid men, that by any means will defend the opinions they are fallen
   upon. The same plea is made by others for accommodation with the
   Papists; and still "moderation," "the middle way," "condescension," are
   cried up. I can freely say, that I know not that man in England who is
   willing to go farther in forbearance, love, and communion with all that
   fear God and hold the foundation, than I am; but that this is to be
   done upon other grounds, principles, and ways, by other means and
   expedients, than by a condescension from the exactness of the least
   apex of gospel truth, or by an accommodation of doctrines by loose and
   general terms, I have elsewhere sufficiently declared. Let no man
   deceive you with vain pretences; hold fast the truth as it is in Jesus,
   part not with one iota, and contend for it when called thereunto.

   2. Take heed of the snare of Satan in affecting eminency by
   singularity. It is good to strive to excel and to go before one another
   in knowledge and in light, as in holiness and obedience. To do this in
   the road is difficult. Ahimaaz had not outrun Cushi but that he took a
   by-path. Many finding it impossible to emerge unto any consideration by
   walking in the beaten path of truth (all parts of divinity, all ways of
   handling it, being carried already to such a height and excellency,
   that to make any considerable improvement requires great pains, study,
   and an insight into all kinds of learning), and yet not able to conquer
   the itch of being accounted tines megaloi, turn aside into by-ways, and
   turn the eyes of all men to them by scrambling over hedge and ditch,
   when the sober traveller is not at all regarded.

   The Roman historian, giving an account of the degeneracy of eloquence
   after it once came to its height in the time of Cicero, fixeth on this
   as the most probable reason: "Difficilis in perfecto mora est;
   naturaliterque, quod procedere non potest, recedit; et ut primo ad
   consequendos, quos priores ducimus, accendimur: ita, ubi aut præteriri,
   aut æquari cos posse desperavimus, studium cum spe senescit; et quod
   adsequi non potest, sequi desinit; et, velut occupatam relinquens
   materiam, quærit novam: præteritoque eo in quo eminere non possumus,
   aliquid in quo nitamur conquirimus; sequiturque, ut frequens ac mobilis
   transitus maximum perfecti operis impedimentum sit." -- Paterc. Hist.
   Rom. lib. i. cap. xvii.

   I wish some such things may not be said of the doctrine of the reformed
   churches. It was not long since raised to a great height of purity in
   itself, and perspicuity in the way of its delivery; but athletic
   constitutions are seldom permanent. [103] Men would not be content to
   walk after others, and finding they could not excel what was done, they
   have given over to imitate it or to do any thing in the like kind; and
   therefore, neglecting that wherein they could not be eminent, they have
   taken a course to have something peculiar wherein to put forth their
   endeavours. Let us, then, watch against this temptation, and know that
   a man may be higher than his brethren, and yet be but a Saul.

   3. Let not any one attempt dealing with these men that is not in some
   good measure furnished with those kinds of literature and those common
   arts wherein they excel; as, first, the knowledge of the tongues
   wherein the Scripture is written, namely, the Hebrew and Greek. He that
   is not in some measure acquainted with these will scarcely make
   thorough work in dealing with them. There is not a word, nor scarce a
   letter in a word (if I may so speak), which they do not search and toss
   up and down; not an expression which they pursue not through the whole
   Scripture, to see if any place will give countenance to the
   interpretation of it which they embrace. The curious use of the Greek
   articles, which, as Scaliger calls them, are "loquacissimæ gentis
   flabellum," is their great covert against the arguments for the deity
   of Christ. Their disputes about the Hebrew words wherein the doctrine
   of the satisfaction of Christ is delivered in the Old Testament, the
   ensuing treatise will in part manifest. Unless a man can debate the use
   of words with them in the Scripture, and by instances from other
   approved authors, it will be hard so to enclose or shut them up but
   that they will make way to evade and escape. Press them with any
   testimony of Scripture, if of any one word of the testimony, whereon
   the sense of the whole in any measure depends, they can except that in
   another place that word in the original hath another signification, and
   therefore it is not necessary that it should here signify as you urge
   it, unless you are able to debate the true meaning and import of the
   word with them, they suppose they have done enough to evade your
   testimony. And no less [necessary], nextly, are the common arts of
   logic and rhetoric, wherein they exercise themselves. Among all
   Socinus' works, there is none more pernicious than the little treatise
   he wrote about sophisms; wherein he labours to give instances of all
   manner of sophistical arguments in those which are produced for the
   confirmation of the doctrine of the blessed Trinity.

   He that would re-enforce those arguments, and vindicate them from his
   exceptions and the entanglements cast upon them, without some
   considerable acquaintance with the principles of logic and artificial
   rules of argumentation, will find himself at a loss. Besides, of all
   men in the world, in their argumentations they are most sophistical. It
   is seldom that they urge any reason or give any exception wherein they
   conclude not "a particulari ad universale," or "ab indefinito ad
   universale, exclusive," or "ab aliqno statu Christi ad omnem," or "ab
   oeconomia Trinitatis ad theologiam Deitatis," or "ab usu vocis alicubi"
   to "ubique:" as, "Christ is a man, therefore not God; he is the servant
   of the Father, therefore not of the same nature." And the like
   instances may be given in abundance; from which kind of arguing he will
   hardly extricate himself who is ignorant of the rudiments of logic. The
   frequency of figurative expressions in the Scripture, which they make
   use of to their advantage, requires the knowledge of rhetoric also in
   him that will deal with them to any good purpose. A good assistance (in
   the former of these especially) is given to students by Keslerus, "in
   examine Logicæ, Metaphysicæ, et Physicæ Photinianæ." The pretended
   maxims, also, which they insist on from the civil law, in the business
   of the satisfaction of Christ, which are especially urged by Socinus,
   and by Crellius in his defence against Grotius, will make him who shall
   engage with them see it necessary in some measure to be acquainted with
   the principles of that faculty and learning also.

   With those who are destitute of these, the great Spirit of truth is an
   abundantly sufficient preserver from all the cunning sleights of men
   that lie in wait to deceive. He can give them to believe and suffer for
   the truth. But that they should at any time look upon themselves as
   called to read the books or dispute with the men of these abominations,
   I can see no ground.

   4. Always bear in mind the gross figments, that they seek to assert and
   establish in the room of that which they cunningly and subtilely
   oppose. Remember that the aim of their arguments against the deity of
   Christ and the blessed Trinity is, to set up two true Gods, the one so
   by nature, the other made so, rather one God in his own essence, the
   other a God from him by office, that was a man, is a spirit, and shall
   cease to be a God. And some farther account hereof you will meet with
   in the close of the ensuing treatise.

   5. Diligent, constant, serious reading, studying, meditating on the
   Scriptures, with the assistance and direction of all the rules and
   advantages for the right understanding of them which, by the
   observation and diligence of many worthies, we are furnished withal,
   accompanied with continual attendance on the throne of grace for the
   presence of the Spirit of truth with us, to lead us into all truth, and
   to increase his anointing of us day by day, "shining into our hearts to
   give us the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,"
   is, as for all other things in the course of our pilgrimage and walking
   with God, so for our preservation against these abominations, and the
   enabling of us to discover their madness and answer their objections,
   of indispensable necessity. Apollos, who was "mighty in the
   Scriptures," Acts xviii. 24, "mightily convinced the" gainsaying
   "Jews," verse 28. Neither, in dealing with these men, is there any
   better course in the world than, in a good order and method, to
   multiply testimonies against them to the same purpose; for whereas they
   have shifts in readiness to every particular, and hope to darken a
   single star, when they are gathered into a constellation they send out
   a glory and brightness which they cannot stand before. Being engaged
   myself once in a public dispute about the satisfaction of Christ, I
   took this course, in a clear and evident coherence, producing very many
   testimonies to the confirmation of it; which together gave such an
   evidence to the truth, that one who stood by instantly affirmed that
   "there was enough spoken to stop the mouth of the devil himself." And
   this course in the business of the deity and satisfaction of Christ
   will certainly be triumphant. Let us, then, labour to have our senses
   abundantly exercised in the word, that we may be able to discern
   between good and evil; and that not by studying the places themselves
   [only] that are controverted, but by a diligent search into the whole
   mind and will of God as revealed in the word; wherein the sense is
   given in to humble souls with more life, power, and evidence of truth,
   and is more effectual for the begetting of faith and love to the truth,
   than in a curious search after the annotations of men upon particular
   places. And truly I must needs say that I know not a more deplorable
   mistake in the studies of divines, both preachers and others, than
   their diversion from an immediate, direct study of the Scriptures
   themselves unto the studying of commentators, critics, scholiasts,
   annotators, and the like helps, which God in his good providence,
   making use of the abilities, and sometimes the ambition and ends of
   men, hath furnished us withal. Not that I condemn the use and study of
   them, which I wish men were more diligent in, but desire pardon if I
   mistake, and do only surmise, by the experience of my own folly for
   many years, that many which seriously study the things of God do yet
   rather make it their business to inquire after the sense of other men
   on the Scriptures than to search studiously into them themselves.

   6. That direction, in this kind, which with me is instar omnium, is for
   a diligent endeavour to have the power of the truths professed and
   contended for abiding upon our hearts, that we may not contend for
   notions, but what we have a practical acquaintance with in our own
   souls. When the heart is cast indeed into the mould of the doctrine
   that the mind embraceth; when the evidence and necessity of the truth
   abides in us; when not the sense of the words only is in our heads, but
   the sense of the things abides in our hearts; when we have communion
   with God in the doctrine we contend for, -- then shall we be
   garrisoned, by the grace of God, against all the assaults of men. And
   without this all our contending is, as to ourselves, of no value. What
   am I the better if I can dispute that Christ is God, but have no sense
   or sweetness in my heart from hence that he is a God in covenant with
   my soul? What will it avail me to evince, by testimonies and arguments,
   that he hath made satisfaction for sin, if, through my unbelief, the
   wrath of God abideth on me, and I have no experience of my own being
   made the righteousness of God in him, -- if I find not, in my standing
   before God, the excellency of having my sins imputed to him and his
   righteousness imputed to me? Will it be any advantage to me, in the
   issue, to profess and dispute that God works the conversion of a sinner
   by the irresistible grace of his Spirit, if I was never acquainted
   experimentally with the deadness and utter impotency to good, that
   opposition to the law of God, which is in my own soul by nature, with
   the efficacy of the exceeding greatness of the power of God in
   quickening, enlightening, and bringing forth the fruits of obedience in
   me? It is the power of truth in the heart alone that will make us
   cleave unto it indeed in an hour of temptation. Let us, then, not think
   that we are any thing the better for our conviction of the truths of
   the great doctrines of the gospel, for which we contend with these men,
   unless we find the power of the truths abiding in our own hearts, and
   have a continual experience of their necessity and excellency in our
   standing before God and our communion with him.

   7. Do not look upon these things as things afar off, wherein you are
   little concerned. The evil is at the door; there is not a city, a town,
   scarce a village, in England, wherein some of this poison is not poured
   forth. Are not the doctrines of free will, universal redemption,
   apostasy from grace, mutability of God, of denying the resurrection of
   the dead, with all the foolish conceits of many about God and Christ,
   in this nation, ready to gather to this head?

   Let us not deceive ourselves; Satan is a crafty enemy. He yet hovers up
   and down in the lubricous, vain imaginations of a confused multitude,
   whose tongues are so divided that they understand not one the other. I
   dare boldly say, that if ever he settle to a stated opposition to the
   gospel, it will be in Socinianism. The Lord rebuke him; he is busy in
   and by many, where little notice is taken of him. But of these things
   thus far.

   A particular account of the cause and reasons of my engagement in this
   business, with what I have aimed at in the ensuing discourse, you will
   find given in my epistle to the university, so that the same things
   need not here also be delivered. The confutation of Mr Biddle's
   Catechism, and Smalcius' Catechism, commonly called the "Racovian;"
   with the vindication of all the texts of Scripture giving testimony to
   the deity of Christ throughout the Old and New Testament from the
   perverse glosses and interpretations put upon them by Hugo Grotius in
   his Annotations on the Bible, with those also which concern his
   satisfaction; and, on the occasion hereof, the confirmation of the most
   important truths of the Scripture, about the nature of God, the person
   of Christ and the Holy Ghost, the offices of Christ, etc., -- have been
   in my design. With what mind and intention, with what love to the
   truth, with what dependence on God for his presence and assistance,
   with what earnestness of supplication to enjoy the fruit of the promise
   of our dear Lord Jesus, to lead me into all truth by his blessed
   Spirit, I have gone through this work, the Lord knows. I only know that
   in every particular I have come short of my duty therein, and that a
   review of my paths and pains would yield me very little refreshment,
   but that "I know in whom I have believed, and am persuaded that even
   concerning this also he will remember me for good, and spare me,
   according to the greatness of his mercy." And whatever becomes of this
   weak endeavour before the Lord, yet "he hath made with me an
   everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure, and this is all
   my salvation and all my desire, although he make it not to grow." What
   is performed is submitted humbly to the judgment of them to whom this
   address is made. About the thoughts of others, or any such as by envy,
   interest, curiosity, or faction, may be swayed or biassed, I am not
   solicitous. If any benefit redound to the saints of the Most High, or
   any that belong to the purpose of God's love be advantaged,
   enlightened, or built up in their most holy faith in the least, by what
   is here delivered, I have my reward.

   plurimum remisisse de studio suo in ecclesiis nostris Transilvanicis
   nostrisque hominibus juvandis: imo eo tandem devenisse ut vix
   existimaretur priorem quam tantopere foverat de Deo et Christo
   sententiam retinere, sed potius Jesuitis, qui in ea provincia tunc
   temporis Stephani regis, et ejus fratris Christopheri haud multo ante
   vitam functi, ope ac liberalitate non mediocriter, fiorebant, jam
   adhærere aut certe cum eis quodammodo colludere Illud certissimum est,

   se est expertus, coepisse quosdam ex nostris hominibus quos charissimos
   prius habebat, et suis opibus juvabat spernere ac deserere, etiam
   contra promissa et obligationem suam, et tandem illos penitus
   deseruisse, atque omni veræ et sinceræ pietatis studio valedixisse, et
   solis pecuniis congerendis intentum fuisse, quæ fortasse justissimo Dei

   promissum est, ergo regnum mundanum posteri Davidis ut haberent necesse
   est: et per consequens, rex file, quem prophetæ ex hac promissione post
   captivitatem Babylonicam regnaturum promiserunt, perinde ut cæteri
   posteri Davidis, mundanum regnum debuit habere. Quod quia Jesus ille
   non habuit (non enim regnavit ut David et posteri ejus), sed dicitur
   habere coeleste regnum, quod est diversum a mundano regno; ergo Jesus
   ille non est rex quem prophetæ promiserunt." -- Martin Seidelius, Ep.
   i. ad Socin.

   [73] "Nam quod dicimus, si Deus mundanum regem mundanumque regnum
   promisit, coelestem autem regein, coeleste, regnum reipsa præstitit
   plus eum præstitisse quam promiserit, recte omimino dicimus, nam qui

Mr Biddle's preface to his catechism.

   I have often wondered and complained that there was no catechism yet
   extant (that I could ever see or hear of) from whence one might learn
   the true grounds of the Christian religion, as the same is delivered in
   the holy Scripture, all catechisms generally being so stuffed with the
   supposals and traditions of men that the least part of them is derived
   from the word of God: for when councils, convocations, and assemblies
   of divines, justling the sacred writers out of their place in the
   church, had once framed articles and confessions of faith according to
   their own fancies and interests, and the civil magistrate had by his
   authority ratified the same, all catechisms were afterward fitted to
   those articles and confessions, and the Scripture either wholly omitted
   or brought in only for a show, not one quotation amongst many being a
   whit to the purpose, as will soon appear to any man of judgment, who,
   taking into his hand the said catechisms, shall examine the texts
   alleged in them; for if he do this diligently and impartially, he will
   find the Scripture and those catechisms to be at so wide a distance one
   from another, that he will begin to question whether the catechists
   gave any heed at all to what they wrote, and did not only themselves
   refuse to make use of their reason, but presume that their readers also
   would do the same. In how miserable a condition, then, as to spiritual
   things, must Christians generally needs be, when thus trained up, not,
   as the apostle adviseth, "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,"
   but in the supposals and traditions of men, having little or no
   assurance touching the reality of their religion! which some observing,
   and not having the happiness to light upon the truth, have quite
   abandoned all piety whatsoever, thinking there is no firm ground
   whereon to build the same. To prevent which mischief in time to come,
   by bringing men to a certainty (I mean such men as own the divine
   authority of the Scripture), and withal to satisfy the just and pious
   desires of many who would fain understand the truth of our religion, to
   the end they might not only be built up themselves, but also instruct
   their children and families in the same, I have here (according to the
   understanding I have gotten by continual meditation on the word of God)
   compiled a Scripture Catechism; wherein I bring the reader to a sure
   and certain knowledge of the chiefest things pertaining both to belief
   and practice, whilst I myself assert nothing (as others have done
   before me), but only introduce the Scripture faithfully uttering its
   own assertions, which all Christians confess to be of undoubted truth.
   Take heed, therefore, whosoever thou art that lightest on this book,
   and there readest things quite contrary to the doctrines that pass
   current amongst the generality of Christians (for I confess most of the
   things here displayed have such a tendency), that thou fall not foul
   upon them; for thou canst not do so without falllng foul upon the holy
   Scripture itself, inasmuch as all the answers throughout the whole
   Catechism are faithfully transcribed out of it and rightly applied to
   the questions, as thou thyself mayst perceive if thou make a diligent
   inspection into the several texts, with all their circumstances. Thou
   wilt perhaps here reply, that the texts which I have cited do indeed in
   the letter hold forth such things as are contrary to the doctrines
   commonly received amongst Christians, but they ought to have a mystical
   or figurative interpretation put upon them, and then both the doctrines
   and the texts of Scripture will suit well enough. To which I answer,
   that if we once take this liberty to impose our mystical or figurative
   interpretations on the Scripture, without express warrant of the
   Scripture itself, we shall have no settled belief, but be liable
   continually to be turned aside by any one that can invent a new
   mystical meaning of the Scripture, there being no certain rule to judge
   of such meanings as there is of the literal ones, nor is there any
   error, how absurd and impious soever, but may on such terms be accorded
   with the Scripture. All the abominable idolatries of the Papists, all
   the superstitious fopperies of the Turks, all the licentious opinions
   and practices of the Ranters, may by this means be not only palliated
   but defended by the word of God. Certainly, might we of our own heads
   figuratively interpret the Scripture, when the letter is neither
   repugnant to our senses nor to the scope of the respective texts, nor
   to a greater number of plain texts to the contrary (for in such cases
   we must of necessity admit figures in the sacred volume as well as we
   do in profane ones, otherwise both they and it will clash with
   themselves or with our senses, which the Scripture itself intimates to
   be of infallible certainty; see 1 John i. 1-3); -- might we, I say, at
   our pleasure impose our figures and allegories on the plain words of
   God, the Scripture would in very deed be, what some blasphemously
   affirm it to be, "a nose of wax." For instance, it is frequently
   asserted in the Scripture that God hath a similitude or shape, hath his
   place in the heavens, hath also affections or passions, as love,
   hatred, mercy, anger, and the like; neither is any thing to the
   contrary delivered there unless seemingly in certain places, which
   neither for number nor clearness are comparable unto those of the other
   side. Why now should I depart from the letter of the Scripture in these
   particulars, and boldly affirm, with the generality of Christians (or
   rather with the generality of such Christians only as, being conversant
   with the false philosophy that reigneth in the schools, have their
   understandings perverted with wrong notions), that God is without a
   shape, in no certain place, and incapable of affections? Would not this
   be to use the Scripture like a nose of wax, and when of itself it
   looketh any way, to turn it aside at our pleasure? And would not God be
   so far from speaking to our capacity in his word (which is the usual
   refuge of the adversaries when in these and the like matters concerning
   God they are pressed with the plain words of the Scripture), as that he
   would by so doing render us altogether incapable of finding out his
   meaning, whilst he spake one thing and understood the clean contrary?
   Yea, would he not have taken the direct course to make men substitute
   an idol in his stead (for the adversaries hold that to conceive of God
   as having a shape, or affections, or being in a certain place, is
   idolatry), if he described himself in the Scripture otherwise than
   indeed he is, without telling us so much in plain terms, that we might
   not conceive amiss of him? Thus we see that when sleep, which plainly
   argueth weakness and imperfection, had been ascribed to God, Ps. xliv.
   23, the contrary is said of him, Ps. cxxi. 4. Again, when weariness had
   been attributed to him, Isa. i. 14, the same is expressly denied of
   him, Isa. xl. 28. And would not God, think ye, have done the like in
   those forementioned things, were the case the same in them as in the
   others? This consideration is so pressing, that a certain author
   (otherwise a very learned and intelligent man) perceiving the weight
   thereof, and not knowing how to avoid the same, took up (though very
   unluckily) one erroneous tenet to maintain another, telling us in a
   late book of his, entitled Conjectura Cabalistica, "That for Moses, by
   occasion of his writings, to let the Jews entertain a conceit of God as
   in human shape, was not any more a way to bring them into idolatry than
   by acknowledging man to be God, as," saith he, "our religion does in
   Christ." How can this consist even with consonancy to his own
   principles, whilst he holds it to be false that God hath any shape, but
   true that Christ is God; for will a false opinion of God not sooner
   lead men into idolatry than a true opinion of Christ? But it is no
   marvel that this author, and other learned men with him, entertain such
   conceits of God and Christ as are repugnant to the current of the
   Scripture, whilst they set so high a rate on the sublime, indeed, but
   uncertain notions of the Platonists, and in the meantime slight the
   plain but certain letter of the sacred writers, as being far below the
   Divine Majesty, and written only to comply with the rude apprehensions
   of the vulgar, unless by a mystical interpretation they be screwed up
   to Platonism. This is the stone at which the pride of learned men hath
   caused them continually to stumble, -- namely, to think that they can
   speak more wisely and worthily of God than he hath spoken of himself in
   his word. This hath brought that more than Babylonish confusion of
   language into the Christian religion, whilst men have framed those
   horrid and intricate expressions, under the colour of detecting and
   excluding heresies, but in truth to put a baffle on the simplicity of
   the Scripture and usher in heresies, that so they might the more easily
   carry on their worldly designs, which could not be effected but through
   the ignorance of the people, nor the people brought into ignorance but
   by wrapping up religion in such monstrous terms as neither the people
   nor they themselves that invented them (or at least took them from the
   invention of others) did understand. Wherefore, there is no possibility
   to reduce the Christian religion to its primitive integrity, -- a
   thing, though much pretended, yea, boasted of in reformed churches, yet
   never hitherto sincerely endeavoured, much less effected (in that men
   have, by severe penalties, been hindered to reform religion beyond such
   a stint as that of Luther, or at most that of Calvin), -- but by
   cashiering those many intricate terms and devised forms of speaking
   imposed on our religion, and by wholly betaking ourselves to the
   plainness of the Scripture: for I have long since observed (and find my
   observation to be true and certain), that when, to express matters of
   religion, men make use of words and phrases unheard of in the
   Scripture, they slily under them couch false doctrines and obtrude them
   on us; for without question the doctrines of the Scripture can be so
   aptly explained in no language as that of the Scripture itself.
   Examine, therefore, the expressions of God's being "infinite and
   incomprehensible, of his being a simple act, of his subsisting in three
   persons or after a threefold manner, of a divine circumincession, of an
   eternal generation, of an eternal procession, of an incarnation, of an
   hypostatical union, of a communication of properties, of the mother of
   God, of God dying, of God made man, of transubstantiation, of
   consubstantiation, of original sin, of Christ's taking our nature on
   him, of Christ's making satisfaction to God for our sins, both past,
   present, and to come, of Christ's fulfilling the law for us, of
   Christ's being punished by God for us, of Christ's merits or his
   meritorious obedience, both active and passive, of Christ's purchasing
   the kingdom of heaven for us, of Christ's enduring the wrath of God,
   yea, the pains of a damned man, of Christ's rising from the dead by his
   own power, of the ubiquity of Christ's body, of apprehending and
   applying Christrighteousness to ourselves by faith, of Christ's being
   our surety, of Christ's paying our debts, of our sins imputed to
   Christ, of Christ's righteousness imputed to us, of Christ's dying to
   appease the wrath of God and reconcile him to us, of infused grace, of
   free grace, of the world of the elect, of irresistible workings of the
   Spirit in bringing men to believe, of carnal reason, of spiritual
   desertions, of spiritual incomes, of the outgoings of God, of taking up
   the ordinance," etc., and thou shalt find that as these forms of speech
   are not owned by the Scripture, so neither the things contained in
   them. How excellent, therefore, was that advice of Paul to Timothy in
   his second epistle to him, 2 Tim. i. 13, "Hold fast the form of sound
   words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in
   Christ Jesus"! for if we once let go those forms of sound words learned
   from the apostles, and take up such as have been coined by others in
   succeeding ages, we shall together [with them] part with the apostles'
   doctrine, as woful experience hath taught us; for after Constantine the
   Great, together with the council of Nice, had once deviated from the
   language of the Scripture in the business touching the Son of God,
   calling him" co-essential with the Father," this opened a gap for
   others afterward, under a pretence of guarding the truth from heretics,
   to devise new terms at pleasure; which did, by degrees, so vitiate the
   chastity and simplicity of our faith, delivered in the Scripture, that
   there hardly remained so much as one point thereof sound and entire. So
   that as it was wont to be disputed in the schools, whether the old ship
   of Theseus (which had in a manner been wholly altered at sundry times,
   by the accession of new pieces of timber upon the decay of the old)
   were the same ship it had been at first, and not rather another by
   degrees substituted in the stead thereof: in like manner there was so
   much of the primitive truth worn away, by the corruption that did, by
   little and little, overspread the generality of Christians, and so many
   errors in stead thereof tacked to our religion, at several times, that
   one might justly question whether it were the same religion with that
   which Christ and his apostles taught, and not another since devised by
   men and put in the room thereof. But thanks be to God through our Lord
   Jesus Christ, who, amidst the universal corruption of our religion,
   hath preserved his written word entire (for had men corrupted it, they
   would have made it speak more favourably in behalf of their lusts and
   worldly interests than it doth); which word, if we with diligence and
   sincerity pry into, resolving to embrace the doctrine that is there
   plainly delivered, though all the world should set itself against us
   for so doing, we shall easily discern the truth, and so be enabled to
   reduce our religion to its first principles. For thus much I perceive
   by mine own experience, who, being otherwise of no great abilities, yet
   setting myself, with the aforesaid resolution, for sundry years
   together upon an impartial search of the Scripture, have not only
   detected many errors, but here presented the reader with a body of
   religion exactly transcribed out of the word of God: which body
   whosoever shall well ruminate and digest in his mind, may, by the same
   method wherein! have gone before him, make a farther inquiry into the
   oracles of God, and draw forth whatsoever yet lies hid; and being
   brought to light, [it] will tend to the accomplishment of godliness
   amongst us, for at this only all the Scripture aimeth; -- the
   Scripture, which all men who have thoroughly studied the same must of
   necessity be enamoured with, as breathing out the mere wisdom of God,
   and being the exactest rule of a holy life (which all religions
   whatsoever confess to be the way unto happiness) that can be imagined,
   and whose divinity will never, even to the world's end, be questioned
   by any but such as are unwilling to deny their worldly lusts and obey
   the pure and perfect precepts thereof; which obedience whosoever shall
   perform, he shall, not only in the life to come, but even in this life,
   be equal unto angels.

   John Biddle.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Mr Biddle's preface briefly examined.

   In the entrance of Mr Biddle's preface he tells the reader very
   modestly "That he could never yet see or hear of a catechism"
   (although, I presume, he had seen, or heard at least, of one or two
   written by Faustus Socinus, though not completed; of one by Valentinus
   Smalcius, commonly called "The Racovian Catechism," from whence many of
   his questions and answers are taken; and of an "Exposition of the
   Articles of Faith, in the Creed called the Apostles', in way of
   catechism, by Jonas Schlichtingius," published in French, anno 1646, in
   Latin, anno 1651) "from whence the true grounds of Christian religion
   might be learned, as it is delivered in Scripture;" and therefore,
   doubtless, all Christians have cause to rejoice at the happy product of
   Mr B.'s pains, wherewith he now acquaints them, ushered in with this
   modest account, whereby at length they may know their own religion,
   wherein as yet they have not been instructed to any purpose. And the
   reason of this is, because "all other catechisms are stuffed with many
   supposals and traditions, the least part of them being derived from the
   word of God," Mr B. being judge. And this is the common language of his
   companions, comparing themselves and their own writings with those of
   other men. [104] The common language they delight in is, "Though
   Christians have hitherto thought otherwise."

   Whether we have reason to stand to this determination, and acquiesce in
   this censure and sentence, the ensuing considerations of what Mr B.
   substitutes in the room of those catechisms which he here rejects will
   evince and manifest. But to give countenance to this humble entrance
   into his work, he tells his reader "That councils, convocations, and
   assemblies of divines, have justled out the Scripture, and framed
   confessions of faith according to their own fancies and interests,
   getting them confirmed by the civil magistrate; according unto which
   confessions all catechisms are and have been framed, without any regard
   to the Scripture." What "councils" Mr B. intends he informs us not, nor
   what it is that in them he chiefly complains of. If he intend some
   only, such as the apostatizing times of the church saw, he knows he is
   not opposed by them with whom he hath to de, nor vet if he charge them
   all for some miscarriages in them or about them. If all, as that of the
   apostles themselves, Acts xv., together with the rest that for some
   ages followed after, and that as to the doctrine by them delivered,
   fall under his censure, we have nothing but the testimony of Mr B. to
   induce us to a belief of this insinuation. [105] His testimony in
   things of this nature will be received only by them who receive his
   doctrine.

   What I have to offer on this account I have spoken otherwhere. That the
   confessions of faith which the first general councils, as they are
   called, during the space of four hundred years and upward, composed and
   put forth, were "framed according to the fancies and interests of men,"
   beside the word, is Mr B.'s fancy, and his interest to have it so
   esteemed. The faith he professeth, or rather the infidelity he has
   fallen into, was condemned in them all, and that upon the occasion of
   its then first coming into the world; "Hinc illæ lacrimæ:" if they
   stand, he must fall. "That the catechisms of latter days" (I suppose he
   intends those in use amongst the reformed churches) "did wholly omit
   the Scripture, or brought it in only for a show, not one quotation
   amongst many being a whit to the purpose," you have the same testimony
   for as for the assertions foregoing. [106] He that will say this, had
   need some other way evince that he makes conscience of what he says, or
   that he dare not say any thing, so it serve his turn. Only Mr B. hath
   quoted Scripture to the purpose! To prove God to be "finite, limited,
   included in heaven, of a visible shape, ignorant of things future,
   obnoxious to turbulent passions and affections," are some of his
   quotations produced; for the like end and purpose are the most of the
   rest alleged. Never, it seems, was the Scripture alleged to any purpose
   before! And these things, through the righteous hand of God taking
   vengeance on an unthankful generation, not delighting in the light and
   truth which he hath sent forth, do we hear and read. Of those who have
   made bold akineta kinein, and to shake the fundamentals of gospel
   truths or the mystery of grace, we have daily many examples. The number
   is far more scarce of them who have attempted to blot out those koinai
   ennoiai, or ingrafted notions of mankind, concerning the perfections of
   God, which Mr B. opposeth. "Fabulas vulgaris nequitia non invenit." An
   opposition to the first principles of rational beings must needs be
   talked of. Other catechists, besides himself, Mr B. tells you, "have
   written with so much oscitancy and contempt of the Scripture, that a
   considering man will question whether they gave any heed to what they
   wrote themselves, or refused to make use of their reason, and presumed
   others would do so also." And so you have the sum of his judgment
   concerning all other catechisms, besides his own, that he hath either
   seen or heard of. "They are all fitted to confessions of faith,
   composed according to the fancies and interests of men, written without
   attending to the Scripture or quoting it to any purpose, their authors,
   like madmen, not knowing what they wrote, and refusing to make use of
   their reason that they might so do." And this is the modest, humble
   entrance of Mr B.'s preface.

   All that have gone before him were knaves, fools, idiots, madmen. The
   proof of these assertions you are to expect. When a philosopher pressed
   Diogenes with this sophism, "What I am, thou art not; I am a man,
   therefore thou art not," he gave him no other answer but, "Begin with
   me, and the conclusion will be true." Mr B. is a Master of Arts, and
   knew, doubtless, that such assertions as might be easily turned upon
   himself are of no use to any but those who have not aught else to say.
   Perhaps Mr B. speaks only to them of the same mind with himself; and
   then, indeed, as Socrates said, it was no hard thing to commend the
   Athenians before the Athenians, but to commend them before the
   Lacedæmonians was difficult. [107] No more is it any great undertaking
   to condemn men sound in the faith unto Socinians; before others it will
   not prove so easy.

   It is not incumbent on me to defend any, much less all the catechisms
   that have been written by learned men of the reformed religion. That
   there are errors in some, mistakes in others; that some are more clear,
   plain, and scriptural than others, I grant. All of them may have, have
   had, their use in their kind. That in any of them there is any thing
   taught inconsistent with communion with God, or inevitably tending to
   the impairing of faith and love, Mr B. is not, I presume, such a
   philoponos as to undertake to demonstrate. I shall only add, that
   notwithstanding the vain plea of having given all his answers in the
   express words of Scripture (whereby, with the foolish bird, he hides
   his head from the fowler, but leaves his whole monstrous body visible,
   the teaching part of his Catechism being solely in the insinuating,
   ensnaring, captious questions thereof, leading the understanding of the
   reader to a misapprehension and misapplication of the words of the
   Scripture, it being very easy to make up the grossest blasphemy
   imaginable out of the words of the Scripture itself), I never found,
   saw, read, or heard of any so grossly perverting the doctrine of the
   Scripture concerning God and all his ways as those of Mr B.'s do; for
   in sundry particulars they exceed those mentioned before of Socinus,
   Smalcius, Schlichtingius, which had justly gotten the repute of the
   worst in the world. And for an account of my reason of this persuasion
   I refer the reader to the ensuing considerations of them.

   This, then, being the sad estate of Christians, so misinformed by such
   vile varlets as have so foully deceived them and misled them, as above
   mentioned, what is to be done and what course to be taken to bring in
   light into the world, and to deliver men from the sorrowful condition
   whereinto they have been catechised? For this end, he tells the reader,
   doth he show himself to the world (Theos apo mechanes), to undeceive
   them, and to bring them out of all their wanderings unto some certainty
   of religion. [108] This he discourses, pp. 4, 5. The reasons he gives
   you of this undertaking are two:-- 1. "To bring men to a certainty;" 2.
   "To satisfy the pious desire of some who would fain know the truth of
   our religion." The way he fixes on for the compassing of the end
   proposed is:-- 1. "By asserting nothing;" 2. "By introducing the plain
   texts of Scripture to speak for themselves." Each briefly may be
   considered.

   1. What fluctuating persons are they, not yet come to any certainty in
   religion, whom Mr B. intends to deal withal? Those, for the most part,
   of them who seem to be intended in such undertakings, are fully
   persuaded from the Scripture of the truth of those things wherein they
   have been instructed. Of these, some, I have heard, have been unsettled
   by Mr B., but that he shall ever settle any (there being no consistency
   in error or falsehood) is impossible. Mr B. knows there is no one of
   the catechists he so decries but directs them whom he so instructs to
   the Scriptures, and settles their faith on the word of God alone,
   though they labour to help their faith and understanding by opening of
   it; whereunto also they are called. I fear Mr B.'s certainty will at
   length appear to be scepticism, and his settling of men to be the
   unsettling; that his conversions are from the faith; and that in this
   very book he aims more to acquaint men with his questions than the
   Scripture answers. [109] But he says, --

   2. Those whom he aims to bring to this certainty are "such as would
   fain understand the truth of our religion." If by "our religion" he
   means the religion of himself and his followers (or rather masters),
   the Socinians, I am sorry to hear that any are so greedy of its
   acquaintance. [110] Happily this is but a pretence, such as his
   predecessors in this work have commonly used. [As] for understanding
   the truth of it, they will find in the issue what an endless work they
   have undertaken. "Who can make that straight which is crooked, or
   number that which is wanting?" If by "our religion" he means the
   Christian religion, it may well be inquired who they are, with their
   "just and pious desires," who yet understand not the truth of Christian
   religion? that is, that it is the only true religion. When we know
   these Turks, Jews, Pagans, which Mr B. hath to deal withal, we shall be
   able to judge of what reason he had to labour to satisfy their "just
   and pious desires." I would also willingly be informed how they came to
   so high an advancement in our religion as to desire to be brought up in
   it, and to be able to instruct others, when as yet they do not
   understand the truth of it, or are not satisfied therein. And, --

   3. As these are admirable men, so the way he takes for their
   satisfaction is admirable also; that is, by "asserting nothing!' He
   that asserts nothing proves nothing; for that which any one proves,
   that he asserts. Intending, then, to bring men to a certainty who yet
   understand not the truth of our religion, he asserts nothing, proves
   nothing (as is the manner of some), but leaves them to themselves; -- a
   most compendious way of teaching (for whose attainment Mr B. needed not
   to have been Master of Arts), if it proves effectual! But by not
   asserting, it is evident Mr B. intends not silence. He hath said too
   much to be so interpreted. Only what he hath spoken, he hath done it in
   a sceptical way of inquiry; wherein, though the intendment of his mind
   be evident, and all his queries may be easily resolved into so many
   propositions or assertions, yet as his words lie, he supposes he may
   speak truly that he asserts nothing. Of the truth, then, of this
   assertion, that he doth not assert any thing, the reader will judge.
   And this is the path to atheism which, of all others, is most trod and
   beaten in the days wherein we live. A liberty of judgment is pretended,
   and queries are proposed, until nothing certain be left, nothing
   unshaken. But, --

   4. He "introduces the Scripture faithfully uttering its own
   assertions." If his own testimony concerning his faithful dealing may
   be taken, this must pass. The express words of the Scripture, I
   confess, are produced, but as to Mr B.'s faithfulness in their
   production, I have sundry exceptions to make; as, --

   (1.) That by his leading questions, and application of the Scripture to
   them, he hath utterly perverted the scope and intendment of the places
   urged. Whereas he pretends not to assert or explain the Scripture, he
   most undoubtedly restrains the signification of the places by him
   alleged unto the precise scope which in his sophistical queries he hath
   included. And in such a way of procedure, what may not the serpentine
   wits of men pretend to a confirmation of from Scripture, or any other
   book that hath been written about such things as the inquiries are made
   after? It were easy to give innumerable instances of this kind, but we
   fear God, and dare not to make bold with him or his word.

   (2.) Mr B. pretending to give an account of the" chiefest things
   pertaining to belief and practice," doth yet propose no question at all
   concerning many of the most important heads of our religion, and
   whereunto the Scripture speaks fully and expressly, or proposes his
   thoughts in the negative, leading on the scriptures from whence he
   makes his objections to the grand truths he opposeth, concealing, as
   was said, the delivery of them in the Scripture in other places
   innumerable; so insinuating to the men of "just and pious desires" with
   whom he hath to do that the Scripture is silent of them. That this is
   the man's way of procedure, in reference to the deity of Christ and of
   the Holy Ghost, the satisfaction and merit of Christ, the corruption of
   nature, and efficacy of grace, with many other most important heads of
   Christian religion, will be fully manifest in our consideration, of the
   several particulars as they shall occur in the method wherein by him
   they are handled.

   (3.) What can be concluded of the mind of God in the Scripture, by
   cutting off any place or places of it from their dependence,
   connection, and tendency, catching at those words which seem to confirm
   what we would have them so to do (whether, in the proper order wherein
   of God they are set and fixed, they do in the least east an eye towards
   the thesis which they are produced to confirm or no), might easily be
   manifested by innumerable instances, were not the vanity of such a
   course evident to all.

   On the consideration of these few exceptions to Mr B.'s way of
   procedure, it will easily appear what little advantage he hath given
   him thereby, and how unjust his pretence is, which by this course he
   aims to prevail upon men withal. This he opens, page 6: "None," saith
   he, "can fall foul upon the things contained in this Catechism" (which
   he confesseth to be "quite contrary to the doctrine that passeth
   current among the generality of Christians"), "as they are here
   displayed, because the answers are transcribed out of the Scriptures."
   But Mr B. may be pleased to take notice that the "displaying," as he
   calls it, of his doctrines is the work of his questions, and not of the
   words of Scripture produced to confirm them, which have a sense
   cunningly and subtilely imposed on them by his queries, or are pointed
   and restrained to the things which in the place of their delivery they
   look not towards in any measure. We shall undoubtedly find, in the
   process of this business, that Mr B.'s questions, being found guilty of
   treason against God, will not be allowed sanctuary in the answers which
   they labour to creep into; and that, they disclaiming their protection,
   they may be pursued, taken, and given up to the justice and severity of
   truth, without the least profanation of their holiness. A murderer may
   be plucked from the horns of the altar.

   Nor is that the only answer insisted on for the removal of Mr B.'s
   sophistry, which he mentions, p. 7, and pursues it for three or four
   leaves onward of his preface, namely, "That the scriptures which he
   urgeth do in the letter hold out such things as he allegeth them to
   prove, but yet they must be figuratively interpreted." For Mr B.'s
   "mystical sense," I know not what he intends by it, or by whom it is
   urged. This is applicable solely to the places he produceth for the
   description of God and his attributes, concerning whom that some
   expressions of Scripture are to be so interpreted himself confesseth,
   p. 13; and we desire to take leave to inquire whether some others,
   beside what Mr B. allows, may not be of the same consideration. In
   other things, for the most part, we have nothing at all to do with so
   much as the interpretation of the places he mentions, but only to
   remove the grossly sophistical insinuations of his queries. For
   instance, when Mr B. asks, "Whether Christ Jesus was a man or no?" and
   allegeth express Scripture affirming that he was, we say not that the
   Scripture must have a figurative interpretation, but that Mr B. is
   grossly sophistical, concluding from the assertion of Christ's human
   nature to the denial of his divine, and desperately injurious to the
   persons with whom he pretends he hath to do, who as yet "understand not
   the truth of our religion," in undertaking to declare to them the
   special "chief things of belief and practice," and hiding from them the
   things of the greatest moment to their salvation, and which the
   Scripture speaks most plentifully unto, by not stating any question or
   making any such inquiry as their affirmation might be suited unto. The
   like instance may be given in all the particulars wherein Mr B. is
   departed from "the faith once delivered to the saints." His whole
   following discourse, then, to the end of p. 13, wherein he decries the
   answer to his way of procedure, which himself had framed, he might have
   spared. It is true, we do affirm that there are figurative expressions
   in the Scripture (and Mr B. dares not say the contrary), and that they
   are accordingly to be interpreted; not that they are to have a mystical
   sense put upon them, but that the literal sense is to be received,
   according to the direction of the figure which is in the words. That
   these words of our Saviour, "This is my body," are figurative, I
   suppose Mr B. will not deny. Interpret them according to the figurative
   import of them, and that interpretation gives you the literal, and not
   a mystical sense, if such figures belong to speech and not to sense.
   That sense, I confess, may be spiritually understood (then it is
   saving) or otherwise; but this doth not constitute different senses in
   the words, but only denote a difference in the understandings of men.
   But all this, in hypothesi, Mr B. fully grants, p. 9; so that there is
   no danger, by asserting it, to cast the least thought of uncertainty on
   the word of God. But, p. 10, he gives you an instance wherein this kind
   of interpretation must by no means be allowed, namely, in the Scripture
   attributions of a shape and similitude (that is, of eyes, ears, hands,
   feet) unto God, with passions and affections like unto us; which that
   they are not proper, but figuratively to be interpreted, he tells you,
   p. 10-12, "those affirm who are perverted by false philosophy, and make
   a nose of wax of the Scripture, which plainly affirms such things of
   God." In what sense the expressions of Scripture intimated concerning
   God are necessarily to be received and understood, the ensuing
   considerations will inform the reader. For the present, I shall only
   say that I do not know scarce a more unhappy instance in his whole book
   that he could have produced than this, wherein he hath been
   blasphemously injurious unto God and his holy word. And herein we shall
   deal with him from Scripture itself, right reason, [111] and the common
   consent of mankind. How remote our interpretations of the places by him
   quoted for his purpose are from wresting the Scriptures, or turning
   them aside from their purpose, scope, and intendment, will also in due
   time be made manifest.

   We say, indeed, as Mr B. observes, that in those kinds of expressions
   God "condescendeth to accommodate his ways and proceedings" (not his
   essence and being) "to our apprehensions;" wherein we are very far from
   saying that "he speaks one thing and intends the clean contrary," but
   only that the things that he ascribes to himself, for our understanding
   and the accommodation of his proceedings to the manner of men, are to
   be understood in him and of them in that which they denote of
   perfection, and not in respect of that which is imperfect and weak.
   [112] For instance, when God says, "his eyes run to and fro, to behold
   the sons of men," we do not say that he speaks one' thing and
   understands another; but only because we have our knowledge and
   acquaintance with things by our eyes looking up and down, therefore
   doth he who hath not eyes of flesh as we have, nor hath any need to
   look up and down to acquaint himself with them, all whose ways are in
   his own hand, nor can without blasphemy be supposed to look from one
   thing to another, choose to express his knowledge of and intimate
   acquaintance with all things here below, in and by his own infinite
   understanding, in the way so suited to our apprehension. Neither are
   these kinds of expressions in the least an occasion of idolatry, or do
   give advantage to any of creating any shape of God in their
   imaginations, God having plainly and clearly, in the same word of his
   wherein these expressions are used, discovered that of himself, his
   nature, being, and properties, which will necessarily determine in what
   sense these expressions are to be understood; as, in the consideration
   of the several particulars in the ensuing discourse, the reader will
   find evinced. And we are yet of the mind, that to conceive of God as a
   great man, with mouth, eyes, hands, legs, etc., in a proper sense,
   sitting in heaven, shut up there, troubled, vexed, moved up and down
   with sundry passions, perplexed about the things that are to come to
   pass, which he knows not, -- which is the notion of God that Mr B.
   labours to deliver the world from their darkness withal, -- is gross
   idolatry, whereunto the scriptural attributions unto God mentioned give
   not the least countenance; as will in the progress of our discourse
   more fully appear. And if it be true, which Mr B. intimates, that
   "things implying imperfection" (speaking of sleep and being weary) "are
   not properly attributed to God," I doubt not but I shall easily evince
   that the same line of refusal is to pass over the visible shape and
   turbulent affections which are by him ascribed to him. But of these
   more particularly in their respective places.

   But he adds, pp. 13, 14, "That this consideration is so pressing, that
   a certain learned author, in his book entitled Conjectura Cabalistica,'
   affirms that for Moses, by occasion of his writings, to let the Jews
   entertain a conceit of God as in human shape was not any more a way to
   bring them into idolatry than by acknowledging man to be God, as our
   religion doth in Christ;" which plea of his Mr B. exagitates in the
   pages following. That learned gentleman is of age and ability to speak
   for himself: for mine own part, I am not so clear in what he affirms as
   to undertake it for him, though otherwise very ready to serve him upon
   the account which I have of his worth and abilities; though I may
   freely say I suppose they might be better exercised than in such
   cabalistical conjectures as the book of his pointed unto is full of.
   But who am I, that judge another? We must every one give an account of
   himself and his labours to God; and the fire shall try our works of
   what sort they are. I shall not desire to make too much work for the
   fire. For the present, I deny that Moses in his writings doth give any
   occasion to entertain a conceit of God as one of a human shape; neither
   did the Jews ever stumble into idolatry on that account. They
   sometimes, indeed, changed their glory for that which was not God; but
   whilst they worshipped that God that revealed himself by Moses,
   Jehovah, Ehejeh, it doth not appear that ever they entertained in their
   thoughts any thing but purum numen, a most simple, spiritual, eternal
   Being, as I shall give a farther account afterward. Though they
   intended to worship Jehovah both in the calf in the wilderness and in
   those at Bethel, yet that they ever entertained any thoughts that God
   had such a shape as that which they framed to worship him by is madness
   to imagine. For though Moses sometimes speaks of God in the
   condescension before mentioned, expressing his power by his arm, and
   bow, and sword, his knowledge and understanding by his eye, yet he doth
   in so many places caution them with whom he had to do of entertaining
   any thoughts of any bodily similitude of God, that by any thing
   delivered by him there is not the least occasion administered for the
   entertaining of such a conceit as is intimated. Neither am I clear in
   the theological predication which that learned person hath chosen to
   parallel with the Mosaical expressions of God's shape and similitude,
   concerning man being God. Though we acknowledge him who is man to be
   God, yet we do not acknowledge man to be God. Christ under this
   reduplication, as man, is not a person, and so not God. To say that man
   is God, is to say that the humanity and Deity are the same. Whatever he
   is as man, he is upon the account of his being man. Now, that he who is
   man is also God, though he be not God upon the account of his being
   man, can give no more occasion to idolatry than to say that God is
   infinite, omnipotent. For the expression itself, it being in the
   concrete, it may be salved by the communication of properties; but as
   it lies, it may possibly be taken in the abstract, and so is simply
   false. Neither do I judge it safe to use such expressions, unless it be
   when the grounds and reasons of them are assigned. But that Mr B.
   should be offended with this assertion I see no reason. Both he and his
   associates affirm that Jesus Christ as man (being in essence and nature
   nothing but man) is made a God; and is the object of divine worship or
   religious adoration on that account. I may therefore let pass Mr B.'s
   following harangue against "men's philosophical speculations, deserting
   the Scripture in their contemplations of the nature of God, as though
   they could speak more worthily of God than he hath done of himself;"
   for though it may easily be made appear that never any of the
   Platonical philosophers spoke so unworthily of God or vented such
   gross, carnal conceptions of him as Mr B. hath done, and the gentleman
   of whom he speaks be well able to judge of what he reads, and to free
   himself from being entangled in any of their notions, discrepant from
   the revelation that God hath made of himself in his word, yet we, being
   resolved to try out the whole matter, and to put all the differences we
   have with Mr B. to the trial and issue upon the express testimony of
   God himself in his word, are not concerned in this discourse.

   Neither have I any necessity to divert to the consideration of his
   complaint concerning the bringing in of new expressions into religion,
   if he intends such as whose substance or matter, which they do express,
   is not evidently and expressly found in the Scripture. What is the
   "Babylonish language," what are "the horrid and intricate expressions,"
   which he affirms to be "introduced under a colour of detecting and
   confuting heresies, but indeed to put a baffle upon the simplicity of
   the Scripture," he gives us an account of, p. 19, where we shall
   consider it and them. In general, words are but the figures of things.
   It is not words and terms, nor expressions, but doctrines and things,
   we inquire after. [113] Mr B., I suppose, allows expositions of
   Scripture, or else I am sure he condemns himself in what he practises.
   His book is, in his own thoughts, an exposition of Scripture. That this
   cannot be done without varying the words and literal expressions
   thereof, I suppose will not be questioned. To express the same thing
   that is contained in any place of Scripture with such other words as
   may give light unto it in our understandings, is to expound it. This
   are we called to, and the course of it is to continue whilst Christ
   continues a church upon the earth. Paul spake nothing, for the
   substance of the things he delivered, but what was written in the
   prophets; that he did not use new expressions, not to be found in any
   of the prophets, will not be proved. But there is a twofold evil in
   these expressions: "That they are invented to detect and exclude
   heresies, as is pretended." If heretics begin first to wrest Scripture
   expressions to a sense never received nor contained in them, it is
   surely lawful for them who are willing to "contend for the faith once
   delivered to the saints" to clear the mind of God in his word by
   expressions and terms suitable thereunto; [114] neither have heretics
   carried on their cause without the invention of new words and phrases.

   If any shall make use of any words, terms, phrases, and expressions, in
   and about religious things, requiring the embracing and receiving of
   those words, etc., by others, without examining either the truth of
   what by those words, phrases, etc., they intend to signify and express,
   or the propriety of those expressions themselves, as to their
   accommodation for the signifying of those things, I plead not for them.
   It is not in the power of man to make any word or expression, not
   rhetos found in the Scripture, to be canonical, and for its own sake to
   be embraced and received. [115] But yet if any word or phrase do
   expressly signify any doctrine or matter contained in the Scripture,
   though the word or phrase itself be not in so many letters found in the
   Scripture, that such word or phrase may not be used for the explication
   of the mind of God I suppose will not easily be proved. And this we
   farther grant, that if any one shall scruple the receiving and owning
   of such expressions, so as to make them the way of professing that
   which is signified by them, and yet do receive the thing or doctrine
   which is by them delivered, for my part I shall have no contest with
   him. For instance, the word omoousios was made use of by the first
   Nicene council to express the unity of essence and being that is in the
   Father and Son, the better to obviate Arius and his followers, with
   their hen hotan ouk en, and the like forms of speech, nowhere found in
   Scripture, and invented on set purpose to destroy the true and eternal
   deity of the Son of God. If, now, any man should scruple the receiving
   of that word, but withal should profess that he believes Jesus Christ
   to be God, equal to the Father, one with him from the beginning, and
   doth not explain himself by other terms not found in the Scripture,
   namely, that he was "made a God," and is "one with the Father as to
   will, not essence," and the like, he is like to undergo neither trouble
   nor opposition from me. We know what troubles arose between the eastern
   and western churches about the words "hypostasis" and "persona," until
   they understood on each side that by these different words the same
   thing was intended, and that hupostasis with the Greeks was not the
   same as "substantia" with the Latins, nor "persona" with the Latins the
   same with prosopon among the Greeks, as to their application to the
   thing the one and the other expressed by these terms. That such
   "monstrous terms are brought into our religion as neither they that
   invented them nor they that use them do understand," Mr B. may be
   allowed to aver, from the measure he hath taken of all men's
   understandings, weighing them in his own, and saying, "Thus far can
   they go and no farther," "This they can understand, that they cannot;"
   -- a prerogative, as we shall see in the process of this business, that
   he will scarcely allow to God himself without his taking much pains and
   labour about it. I profess, for ray part, I have not as yet the least
   conviction fallen upon me that Mr B. is furnished with so large an
   understanding, whatever he insinuates of his own abilities, as to be
   allowed a dictator of what any man can or cannot understand. If his
   principle, or rather conclusion, upon which he limits the
   understandings of men be this, "What I cannot understand, that no man
   else can," he would be desired to consider that he is as yet but a
   young man, who hath not had so many advantages and helps for the
   improving of his understanding as some others have had; and, besides,
   that there are some whose eyes are blinded by the god of this world,
   that they shall never see or understand the things of God, yea, and
   that God himself doth thus oftentimes execute his vengeance on them,
   for detaining his truth in unrighteousness.

   But yet, upon this acquaintance which he hath with the measure of all
   men's understandings, he informs his reader that "the only way to carry
   on the reformation of the church, beyond what yet hath been done by
   Luther or Calvin, is by cashiering those many intricate terms and
   devised forms of speaking," which he hath observed slily to couch false
   doctrines, and to obtrude them on us; and, by the way, that "this
   carrying on of reformation beyond the stint of Luther or Calvin was
   never yet so much as sincerely endeavoured." In the former passage,
   having given out himself as a competent judge of the understandings of
   all men, in this he proceeds to their hearts. "The reformation of the
   church," saith he, "was never sincerely attempted, beyond the stint of
   Luther and Calvin." Attempted it hath been, but he knows all the men
   and their hearts full well who made those attempts, and that they never
   did it sincerely, but with guile and hypocrisy! Mr B. knows who those
   are that say, "With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own."
   To know the hearts of men and their frame towards himself, Mr B.
   instructs us, in his Catechism, that God himself is forced to make
   trial and experiments; but for his own part, without any great trouble,
   he can easily pronounce of their sincerity or hypocrisy in any
   undertaking! Low and vile thoughts of God will quickly usher in light,
   proud, and foolish thoughts concerning ourselves. Luther and Calvin
   were men whom God honoured above many in their generation; and on that
   account we dare not but do so also. That all church reformation is to
   be measured by their line, -- that is, that no farther discovery of
   truth, in, or about, or concerning the ways or works of God, may be
   made, but what hath been made to them and by them, -- was not, that I
   know of, ever yet affirmed by any in or of any reformed church in the
   world. The truth is, such attempts as this of Mr B.'s to overthrow all
   the foundations of Christian religion, to accommodate the Gospel to the
   Alcoran, and subject all divine mysteries to the judgment of that
   wisdom which is carnal and sensual, under the fair pretence of carrying
   on the work of reformation and of discovering truth from the Scripture,
   have perhaps fixed some men to the measure they have received beyond
   what Christian ingenuity and the love of the truth requireth of them. A
   noble and free inquiry into the word of God, with attendance to all
   ways by him appointed or allowed for the revelation of his mind, with
   reliance on his gracious promise of "leading us into all truth" by his
   holy and blessed Spirit, without whose aid, guidance, direction, light,
   and assistance, we can neither know, understand, nor receive the things
   that are of God; neither captivated to the traditions of our fathers,
   for whose labour and pains in the work of the gospel, and for his
   presence with them, we daily bless the name of our God; neither yet
   "carried about with every wind of doctrine," breathed or insinuated by
   the "cunning sleight of men who lie in wait to deceive," -- is that
   which we profess. What the Lord will be pleased to do with us by or in
   this frame, upon these principles; how, wherein, we shall serve our
   generation, in the revelation of his mind and will, -- is in his hand
   and disposal. About using or casting off words and phrases, formerly
   used to express any truth or doctrine of the Scripture, we will not
   contend with any, provided the things themselves signified by them be
   retained. This alone makes me indeed put any value on any word or
   expression not rhetos found in the Scripture, namely, my observation
   that they are questioned and rejected by none but such as, by their
   rejection, intend and aim at the removal of the truth itself which by
   them is expressed, and plentifully revealed in the word. The same care
   also was among them of old, having the same occasion administered.
   Hence when Valens, [116] the Arian emperor, sent Modestus, his
   prætorian præfect, to persuade Basil to be an Arian, the man entreated
   him not to be so rigid as to displease the emperor and trouble the
   church, di' oligen dogmaton akribeian, for an over-strict observance of
   opinions, it being but one word, indeed one syllable, that made the
   difference, and he thought it not prudent to stand so much upon so
   small a business. The holy man replied, Tois theiois logois
   entethrammenoi proesthai men ton theion dogmaton oude mian anechontai
   sullaben -- "However children might be so dealt withal, those who are
   bred up in the Scriptures or nourished with the word will not suffer
   one syllable of divine truth to be betrayed." The like attempt to this
   of Valens and Modestus upon Basil was made by the Arian bishops at the
   council of Ariminum, [117] who pleaded earnestly for the rejection of
   one or two words not found in the Scripture, laying on that plea much
   weight, when it was the eversion of the deity of Christ which they
   intended and attempted. And by none is there more strength and evidence
   given to this observation than by him with whom I have now to do, who,
   exclaiming against words and expressions, intends really the subversion
   of all the most fundamental and substantial truths of the gospel; and
   therefore, having, pp. 19-21, reckoned up many expressions which he
   dislikes, condemns, and would have rejected, most of them relating to
   the chiefest heads of our religion (though, to his advantage, he cast
   in by the way two or three gross figments), he concludes "that as the
   forms of speech by him recounted are not used in the Scripture, no more
   are the things signified by them contained therein." In the issue,
   then, all the quarrel is fixed upon the things themselves, which, if
   they were found in Scripture, the expressions insisted on might be
   granted to suit them well enough. What need, then, all this long
   discourse about words and expressions, when it is the things themselves
   signified by them that are the abominations decried? Now, though most
   of the things here pointed unto will fall under our ensuing
   considerations, yet because Mr B. hath here cast into one heap many of
   the doctrines which in the Christian religion he opposeth and would
   have renounced, it may not be amiss to take a short view of the most
   considerable instances in our passage.

   His first is of God's being infinite and incomprehensible. This he
   condemns, name and thing, -- that is, he says "he is finite, limited,
   of us to be comprehended;" for those who say he is infinite and
   incomprehensible do say only that he is not finite nor of us to be
   comprehended. What advance is made towards the farther reformation of
   the church [118] by this new notion of Mr B.'s is fully discovered in
   the consideration of the second chapter of his Catechism; and in this,
   as in sundry other things, Mr B. excels his masters. [119] The
   Scripture tells us expressly that "he filleth heaven and earth;" that
   the "heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him;" that his
   presence is in heaven and hell, and that "his understanding is
   infinite" (which how the understanding of one that is finite may be, an
   infinite understanding cannot comprehend); that he "dwelleth in that
   light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can
   see" (which to us is the description of one incomprehensible); that he
   is "eternal," which we cannot comprehend. The like expressions are used
   of him in great abundance. Besides, if God be not incomprehensible, we
   may search out his power, wisdom, and understanding to the utmost; for
   if we cannot, if it be not possible so to do, he is incomprehensible.
   But "canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
   Almighty to perfection?" "There is no searching of his understanding."
   If by our lines we suppose we can fathom the depth of the essence,
   omnipotency, wisdom, and understanding of God, I doubt not but we shall
   find ourselves mistaken. Were ever any, since the world began, before
   quarrelled withal for asserting the essence and being of God to be
   incomprehensible? The heathen who affirmed that the more he inquired,
   the more he admired and the less he understood, [120] had a more noble
   reverence of the eternal Being [121] which in his mind he conceived,
   than Mr B. will allow us to entertain of God. Farther; if God be not
   infinite, he is circumscribed in some certain place; if he be, is he
   there fixed to that place, or doth he move from it? If he be fixed
   there, how can he work at a distance, especially such things as
   necessarily require divine power to their production? If he move up and
   down, and journey as his occasions require, what a blessed enjoyment of
   himself in his own glory hath he! But that this blasphemous figment of
   God's being limited and confined to a certain place is really
   destructive to all the divine perfections of the nature and being of
   God is afterward demonstrated. And this is the first instance given by
   Mr B. of the corruption of our doctrine, which he rejects name and
   thing, namely, "that God is infinite and incomprehensible." And now,
   whether this man be a "mere Christian" or a mere Lucian, let the reader
   judge.

   That God is a simple act is the next thing excepted against and
   decried, name and thing; in the room whereof, that he is compounded of
   matter and form," or the like, must be asserted. Those who affirm God
   to be a simple act do only deny him to be compounded of divers
   principles, and assert him to be always actually in being, existence,
   and intent operation. [122] God says of himself that his name is
   Ehejeh, and he is I am, -- that is, a simple being, existing in and of
   itself; and this is that which is intended by the simplicity of the
   nature of God, and his being a simple act. The Scripture tells us he is
   eternal, I am, always the same, and so never what he was not ever. This
   is decried, and in opposition to it his being compounded, and so
   obnoxious to dissolution, and his being in potentia, in a disposition
   and passive capacity to be what he is not, is asserted; for it is only
   to deny these things that the term "simple" is used, which he condemns
   and rejects. And this is the second instance that Mr B. gives in the
   description of his God, by his rejecting the received expressions
   concerning him who is so: "He is limited, and of us to be comprehended;
   his essence and being consisting of several principles, whereby he is
   in a capacity of being what he is not." Mr B., solus habeto; I will not
   be your rival in the favour of this God.

   And this may suffice to this exception of Mr B., by the way, against
   the simplicity of the being of God; yet, because he doth not directly
   oppose it afterward, and the asserting of it doth clearly evert all his
   following fond imaginations of the shape, corporeity, and limitedness
   of the essence of God (to which end also I shall, in the consideration
   of his several depravations of the truth concerning the nature of God,
   insist upon it), I shall a little here divert to the explication of
   what we intend by the simplicity of the essence of God, and confirm the
   truth of what we so intend thereby.

   As was, then, intimated before, though simplicity seems to be a
   positive term, or to denote something positively, yet indeed it is a
   pure negation, [123] and formally, immediately, and properly, denies
   multiplication, composition, and the like. And though this only it
   immediately denotes, yet there is a most eminent perfection of the
   nature of God thereby signified to us; which is negatively proposed,
   because it is in the use of things that are proper to us, in which case
   we can only conceive what is not to be ascribed to God. Now, not to
   insist on the metaphysical notions and distinctions of simplicity, by
   the ascribing of it to God we do not only deny that he is compounded of
   divers principles really distinct, but also of such as are improper,
   and not of such a real distance, or that he is compounded of any thing,
   or can be compounded with any thing whatever.

   First, then, that this is a property of God's essence or being is
   manifest from his absolute independence and firstness in being and
   operation, which God often insists upon in the revelation of himself:
   Isa. xliv. 6, "I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there
   is no God." Rev. i. 8, "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
   ending, saith the Lord, which is," etc.: so chap. xxi. 6, xxii. 13.
   Which also is fully asserted, Rom. xi. 35, 36, "Who hath first given to
   him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? for of him, and
   through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever."
   Now, if God were of any causes, internal or external, any principles
   antecedent or superior to him, he could not be so absolutely first and
   independent. Were he composed of parts, accidents, manner of being, he
   could not be first; for all these are before that which is of them, and
   therefore his essence is absolutely simple.

   Secondly, God is absolutely and perfectly one and the same, and nothing
   differs from his essence in it: "The Lord our God is one Lord," Deut.
   vi. 4; "Thou art the same," Ps. cii. 27. And where there is an absolute
   oneness and sameness in the whole, there is no composition by an union
   of extremes. Thus is it with God: his name is, "I am; I am that I am,"
   Exod. iii. 14, 15; "Which is," Rev. i. 8. He, then, who is what he is,
   and whose all that is in him is, himself, hath neither parts,
   accidents, principles, nor any thing else, whereof his essence should
   be compounded.

   Thirdly, The attributes of God, which alone seem to be distinct things
   in the essence of God, are all of them essentially the same with one
   another, and every one the same with the essence of God itself. For,
   first, they are spoken one of another as well as of God; as there is
   his "eternal power" as well as his "Godhead." And, secondly, they are
   either infinite and infinitely perfect, or they are not. If they are,
   then if they are not the same with God, there are more things infinite
   than one, and consequently more Gods; for that which is absolutely
   infinite is absolutely perfect, and consequently God. If they are not
   infinite, then God knows not himself, for a finite wisdom cannot know
   perfectly an infinite being. And this might be farther confirmed by the
   particular consideration of all kinds of composition, with a
   manifestation of the impossibility of their attribution unto God;
   arguments to which purpose the learned reader knows where to find in
   abundance.

   Fourthly, Yea, that God is, and must needs be, a simple act (which
   expression Mr B. fixes on for the rejection of it) is evident from this
   one consideration, which was mentioned before: If he be not so, there
   must be some potentiality in God. Whatever is, and is not a simple act,
   hath a possibility to be perfected by act; if this be in God, he is not
   perfect, nor all-sufficient. Every composition whatever is of power and
   act; which if it be, or might have been in God, he could not be said to
   be immutable, which the Scripture plentifully witnesseth that he is.

   These are some few of the grounds of this affirmation of ours
   concerning the simplicity of the essence of God; which when Mr B.
   removes and answers, he may have more of them, which at present there
   is no necessity to produce.

   From his being he proceeds to his subsistence, and expressly rejects
   his subsisting in three persons, name and thing. That this is no new
   attempt, no undertaking whose glory Mr B. may arrogate to himself, is
   known. Hitherto God hath taken thought for his own glory, and eminently
   confounded the opposers of the subsistence of his essence in three
   distinct persons. Inquire of them that went before, and of the dealings
   of God with them of old. What is become of Ebion, Cerinthus, Paulus
   Samosatenus, Theodotus Byzantinus, Photinus, Arius, Macedonius, etc.?
   Hath not God made their memory to rot, and their names to be an
   abomination to all generations? How they once attempted to have taken
   possession of the churches of God, making slaughter and havoc of all
   that opposed them, hath been declared; but their place long since knows
   them no more. By the subsisting of God in any person, no more is
   intended than that person's being God. If that person be God, God
   subsists in that person. If you grant the Father to be a person (as the
   Holy Ghost expressly affirms him to be, Heb. i. 3) and to be God, you
   grant God to subsist in that person: that is all which by that
   expression is intended. The Son is God, or is not. To say he is not
   God, is to beg that which cannot be proved. If he be God, he is the
   Father, or he is another person. If he be the Father, he is not the
   Son. That he is the Son and not the Son is sufficiently contradictory.
   If he be not the Father, as was said, and yet be God, he may have the
   same nature and substance with the Father (for of our God there is but
   one essence, nature, or being), and yet be distinct from him. That
   distinction from him is his personality, -- that property whereby and
   from whence he is the Son. The like is to be said of the Holy Ghost.
   The thing, then, here denied is, that the Son is God, or that the Holy
   Ghost is God: for if they are so, God must subsist in three persons; of
   which more afterward. Now, is this not to be found in the Scriptures?
   Is there no text affirming Christ to be God, to be one with the Father,
   or that the Holy Ghost is so? no text saying, "There are three that
   bear record in heaven; and these three are one?" none ascribing divine
   perfections, divine worship distinctly to either Son or Spirit, and yet
   jointly to one God? Are none of these things found in the Scripture,
   that Mr B. thinks with one blast to demolish all these ancient
   foundations, and by his bare authority to deny the common faith of the
   present saints, and that wherein their predecessors in the worship of
   God are fallen asleep in peace? The proper place for the consideration
   of these things will farther manifest the abomination of this bold
   attempt against the Son of God and the Eternal Spirit.

   For the divine circumincession, mentioned in the next place, I shall
   only say that it is not at all in my intention to defend all the
   expressions that any men have used (who are yet sound in the main) in
   the unfolding of this great, tremendous mystery of the blessed Trinity,
   and I could heartily wish that they had some of them been less curious
   in their inquiries and less bold in their expressions. It is the thing
   itself alone whose faith I desire to own and profess; and therefore I
   shall not in the least labour to retain and hold those things or words
   which may be left or lost without any prejudice thereunto.

   Briefly; by the barbarous term of "mutual circumincession," the
   schoolmen understand that which the Greek fathers called
   emperichoresis, whereby they expressed that mystery, which Christ
   himself teaches us, of "his being in the Father, and the Father in
   him," John x. 38, and of the Father's dwelling in him, and doing the
   works he did, chap. xiv. 10, -- the distinction of these persons being
   not hereby taken away, but the disjunction of them as to their nature
   and being.

   The eternal generation of the Son is in the next place rejected, that
   he may be sure to cast down every thing that looks towards the
   assertion of his deity, whom yet the apostle affirms to be" God blessed
   for ever," Rom. ix. 5. That the Word, which "in the beginning was" (and
   therefore is) "God," is "the only begotten of the Father," the apostle
   affirms, John i. 14. That he is also" the only begotten Son of God" we
   have other plentiful testimonies, Ps. ii. 7; John iii. 16; Acts xiii.
   33; Heb. i. 4-6; -- a Son so as, in comparison of his sonship, the best
   of sons by adoption are servants, Heb. iii. 5, 6; and so begotten as to
   be an only Son, John i. 14; though, begotten by grace, God hath many
   sons, James i. 18. Christ, then, being begotten of the Father, hath his
   generation of the Father; for these are the very same things in words
   of a diverse sound. The only question here is, whether the Son have the
   generation so often spoken of from eternity or in time, -- whether it
   be an eternal or a temporal generation from whence he is so said to be
   "begotten." As Christ is a Son, so by him the "worlds were made," Heb.
   i. 2, so that surely he had his sonship before he took flesh in the
   fulness of time; and when he had his sonship he had his generation. He
   is such a Son as, by being partaker of that name, he is exalted above
   angels, Heb. i. 5; and he is the "first begotten" before he is brought
   into the world, verse 6: and therefore his "goings forth" are said to
   be "from the days of eternity," Mic. v. 2; and he had "glory with the
   Father" (as the Son) "before the world was," John xvii. 5. Neither is
   he said to be "begotten of the Father" in respect of his incarnation,
   but conceived by the Holy Ghost, or formed in the womb by him, of the
   substance of his mother; nor is he thence called the "Son of God." In
   brief, if Christ be the eternal Son of God, Mr B. will not deny him to
   have had an eternal generation: if he be not, a generation must be
   found out for him suitable to the sonship which he hath; of which
   abomination in its proper place.

   This progress have we made in Mr B.'s creed: He believes God to be
   finite, to be by us comprehended, compounded; he believes there is no
   trinity of persons in the Godhead, -- that Christ is not the eternal
   Son of God. The following parts of it are of the same kind:--

   The eternal procession of the Holy Ghost is nextly rejected. The Holy
   Ghost being constantly termed the "Spirit of God," the "Spirit of the
   Father," and the "Spirit of the Son" (being also" God," as shall
   afterward be evinced), and so partaking of the same nature with Father
   and Son (the apostle granting that God hath a nature, in his rejecting
   of them who" by nature are no gods"), is yet distinguished from them,
   and that eternally (as nothing is in the Deity that is not eternal),
   and being, moreover, said ekporeuesthai or to "proceed" and "go forth"
   from the Father and Son, this expression of his "eternal procession"
   hath been fixed on, manifesting the property whereby he is
   distinguished from Father and Son. The thing intended hereby is, that
   the Holy Ghost, who is God, and is said to be of the Father and the
   Son, is by that name, of his being of them, distinguished from them;
   and the denial hereof gives you one article more of Mr B.'s creed,
   namely, that the Holy Ghost is not God. To what that expression of
   "proceeding" is to be accommodated will afterward be considered.

   The incarnation of Christ (the Deity and Trinity being despatched) is
   called into question, and rejected. By "incarnation" is meant, as the
   word imports, a taking of flesh (this is variously by the ancients
   expressed, but the same thing still intended [124] ), or being made so.
   The Scripture affirming that "the Word was made flesh," John i. 14;
   that "God was manifest in the flesh," 1 Tim. iii. 16; that "Christ took
   part of flesh and blood," Heb. ii. 14; that "he took on him the seed of
   Abraham," chap. ii. 16; that he was "made of a woman," Gal. iv. 4, 5;
   sent forth "in the likeness of sinful flesh," Rom. viii. 3; "in all
   things made like unto his brethren," Heb. ii. 17, -- we thought we
   might have been allowed to say so also, and that this expression might
   have escaped with a less censure than an utter rejection out of
   Christian religion. The Son of God taking flesh, and so being made like
   to us, that he might be the "captain of our salvation," is that which
   by this word (and that according to the Scripture) is affirmed, and
   which, to increase the heap of former abominations (or to "carry on the
   work of reformation beyond the stint of Luther or Calvin"), is here by
   Mr B. decried.

   Of the hypostatical union there is the same reason. Christ, who as
   "concerning the flesh" was of the Jews, and is God to be blessed for
   ever, over all, Rom. ix. 5, is one person. Being God to be blessed over
   all, that is, God by nature (for such as are not so, and yet take upon
   them to be gods, God will destroy), and having "flesh and blood as the
   children" have, Heb. ii. 14, that is, the same nature of man with
   believers, yet being but one person, one mediator, one Christ, the Son
   of God, we say both these natures of God and man are united in that one
   person, namely, the person of the Son of God. This is that which Mr B.
   rejects (now his hand is in), both name and thing. The truth is, all
   these things are but colourable advantages wherewith he laboureth to
   amuse poor souls. Grant the deity of Christ, and he knows all these
   particulars will necessarily ensue; and whilst he denies the
   foundation, it is to no purpose to contend about any consequences or
   inferences whatever. And whether we have ground for the expression
   under present consideration, John i. 14, 18, xx. 28; Acts xx. 28; Rom.
   i. 3, 4, ix. 5; Gal. iv. 4; Phil. ii. 5-8; 1 Tim. iii. 16, i.John i. 1,
   2; Rev. v. 12-14, with innumerable other testimonies of Scripture, may
   be considered. If "the Word, the Son of God, was made flesh, made of a
   woman, took our nature," wherein he was pierced and wounded, and shed
   his blood, and yet continues" our Lord and our God, God blessed for
   ever," esteeming it "no robbery to be equal with his Father," yet being
   a person distinct from him, being the "brightness of his person," we
   fear not to say that the two natures of God and man are united in one
   person; which is the hypostatical union here rejected.

   The communication of properties, on which depend two or three of the
   following instances mentioned by Mr B., is a necessary consequent of
   the union before asserted; and the thing intended by it is no less
   clearly delivered in Scripture than the truths before mentioned. [125]
   It is affirmed of "the man Christ Jesus" that he "knew what was in the
   heart of man," that he "would be with his unto the end of the world,"
   and Thomas, putting his hand into his side, cried out to him, "My Lord
   and my God," etc., when Christ neither did nor was so, as he was man.
   [126] Again, it is said that "God redeemed his church with his own
   blood," that the "Son of God was made of a woman," that "the Word was
   made flesh," none of which can properly be spoken of God, his Son, or
   eternal Word, [127] in respect of that nature whereby he is so; and
   therefore we say, that look what properties are peculiar to either of
   his natures (as, to be omniscient, omnipotent, to be the object of
   divine worship, to the Deity; [128] to be born, to bleed, and die, to
   the humanity), are spoken of in reference to his person, wherein both
   those natures are united. So that whereas the Scriptures say that "God
   redeemed his church with his own blood," or that he was "made flesh;"
   or whereas, in a consonancy thereunto, and to obviate the folly of
   Nestorius, who made two persons of Christ, the ancients called the
   blessed Virgin the Mother of God, -- the intendment of the one and
   other is no more but that he was truly God, who in his manhood was a
   son, had a mother, did bleed and die. And such Scripture expressions we
   affirm to be founded in this "communication of properties," or the
   assignment of that unto the person of Christ, however expressly spoken
   of as God or man, which is proper to him in regard of either of these
   natures, the one or other, God on this account being said to do what is
   proper to man, and man what is proper alone to God, because he who is
   both God and man doth both the one and the other. [129] By what
   expressions and with what diligence the ancients warded the doctrine of
   Christ's personal union against both Nestorius and Eutyches, [130] the
   one of them dividing his person into two, the other confounding his
   natures by an absurd confusion and mixture of their respective
   essential properties (Mr B. not giving occasion), I shall not farther
   mention.

   And this is all Mr B. instances in of what he rejects as to our
   doctrine about the nature of God, the Trinity, person of Christ, and
   the Holy Ghost; of all which he hath left us no more than what the
   Turks and other Mohammedans will freely acknowledge. [131] And whether
   this be to be a "mere Christian," or none at all, the pious reader will
   judge.

   Having dealt thus with the person of Christ, he adds the names of two
   abominable figments, to give countenance to his undertaking, wherein he
   knows those with whom he hath to do have no communion, casting the
   deity of Christ and the Holy Ghost into the same bundle with
   transubstantiation and consubstantiation; to which he adds the ubiquity
   of the body of Christ, after mentioned, -- self-contradicting fictions.
   With what sincerity, candour, and Christian ingenuity, Mr B. hath
   proceeded, in rolling up together such abominations as these with the
   most weighty and glorious truths of the gospel, that together he might
   trample them under his feet in the mire, God will certainly in due time
   reveal to himself and all the world.

   The next thing he decries is original sin (I will suppose Mr B. knows
   what those whom he professeth to oppose intend thereby); and this he
   condemns, name and thing. That the guilt of our first father's sin is
   imputed to his posterity; that they are made obnoxious to death
   thereby, that we are "by nature children of wrath, dead in trespasses
   and sins, conceived in sin; that our understandings are darkness, so
   that we cannot receive the things that are of God; that we are able to
   do no good of ourselves, so that unless we are born again we cannot
   enter into the kingdom of God; that we are alienated, enemies, have
   carnal minds, that are enmity against God, and cannot be subject to
   him;" [132] -- all this and the like is at once blown away by Mr B.;
   there is no such thing. "Una litura potest." That Christ by nature is
   not God, that we by nature have no sin, are the two great principles of
   this "mere Christian's" belief.

   Of Christ's taking our nature upon him, which is again mentioned, we
   have spoken before. If he was "made flesh, made of a woman, made under
   the law; if he partook of flesh and blood because the children partake
   of the same; if he took on him the seed of Abraham, and was made like
   to us in all things, sin only excepted; if, being in the form of God
   and equal to him, he took on him the form of a servant, and became like
   to us, -- he took our nature on him; [133] for these, and these only,
   are the things which by that expression are intended.

   The most of what follows is about the grace of Christ, which, having
   destroyed what in him lies his person, he doth also openly reject; and
   in the first place begins with the foundation, his making satisfaction
   to God for our sins, all our sins, past, present, and to come, which
   also, under sundry other expressions, he doth afterward condemn. God is
   a God of "purer eyes than to behold evil," and it is "his judgment that
   they which commit sin are worthy of death;" yea, "it is a righteous
   thing with him to render tribulation" to offenders; [134] and seeing we
   have "all sinned and come short of the glory of God," doubtless it will
   be a righteous thing with him to leave them to answer for their own
   sins who so proudly and contemptuously reject the satisfaction which he
   himself hath appointed and the ransom he hath found out. [135] But Mr
   B. is not the first who hath "erred, not knowing the Scriptures" nor
   the justice of God. The Holy Ghost acquainting us that "the Lord made
   to meet upon him the iniquity of us all; that he was wounded for our
   transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, and that the chastisement
   of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed; that he
   gave his life a ransom for us, and was made sin for us, that we might
   become the righteousness of God in him; that he was for us made under
   the law and underwent the curse of it; that he bare our sins in his
   body on the tree; and that by his blood we are redeemed, washed, and
   saved," [136] -- we doubt not to speak as we believe, namely, that
   Christ underwent the punishment due to our sins, and made satisfaction
   to the justice of God for them; and Mr B., who it seems is otherwise
   persuaded, we leave to stand or fall to his own account.

   Most of the following instances of the doctrines he rejects belong to
   and may be reduced to the head last mentioned, and therefore I shall
   but touch upon them. Seeing that "he that will enter into life must
   keep the commandments, and this of ourselves we cannot do, for in many
   things we offend all, and he that breaks one commandment is guilty of
   the breach of the whole law, [137] God having sent forth his Son, made
   of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law,
   that we might receive the adoption of children; and that which was
   impossible to us by the law, through the weakness of the flesh, God
   sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
   condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be
   fulfilled in us; and so we are saved by his life, being justified by
   his blood, he being made unto us of God righteousness, and we are by
   faith found in him, having on not our own righteousness, which is by
   the law, but that which is by Jesus Christ, the righteousness of God by
   faith;" [138] -- we do affirm that Christ fulfilled the law for us, not
   only undergoing the penalty of it, but for us submitting to the
   obedience of it, and performing all that righteousness which of us it
   requires, that we might have a complete righteousness wherewith to
   appear before God. And this is that which is intended by the active and
   passive righteousness of Christ, after mentioned; all which is
   rejected, name and thing.

   Of Christ's being punished by God, which he rejects in the next place,
   and, to multiply his instances of our false doctrines, insists on it
   again under the terms of Christ's enduring the wrath of God and the
   pains of a damned man, the same account is to be given as before of his
   satisfaction. That God "bruised him, put him to grief, laid the
   chastisement of our peace on him; [139] that for us he underwent death,
   the curse of the law, which inwrapped the whole punishment due to sin,
   and that by the will of God, who so made him to be sin who knew no sin,
   and in the undergoing whereof he prayed and cried, and sweat blood, and
   was full of heaviness and perplexity," [140] the Scripture is
   abundantly evident; and what we assert amounts not one tittle beyond
   what is by and in it affirmed.

   The false doctrine of the merit of Christ, and his purchasing for us
   the kingdom of heaven, is the next stone which this master-builder
   disallows and rejects. That "Christ hath bought us with a price; that
   he hath redeemed us from our sins, the world, and curse, to be a
   peculiar people, zealous of good works, so making us kings and priests
   to God for ever; that he hath obtained for us eternal redemption,
   procuring the Spirit for us, to make us meet for the inheritance of the
   saints in light, God blessing us with all spiritual blessings in
   heavenly places in him, upon the account of his making his soul an
   offering for sin," performing that obedience to the law which of us is
   required, [141] -- is that which by this expression of the "merit of
   Christ" we intend, the fruit of it being all the accomplishment of the
   promise made to him by the Father, upon his undertaking the great work
   of saving his people from their sins. In the bundle of doctrines by Mr
   B. at once condemned, this also hath its place.

   That Christ rose from the dead by his own power seems to us to be true,
   not only because he affirmed that he "had power so to do, even to lay
   down his life and to take it again," John x. 18, but also because he
   said he would do so when be bade them "destroy the temple," and told
   them that "in three days he would raise it again." It is true that this
   work of raising Christ from the dead is also ascribed to the Father and
   to the Spirit (as in the work of his oblation, his Father "made his
   soul an offering for sin," and he "offered up himself through the
   eternal Spirit"), yet this hinders not but that he was raised by his
   own power, his Father and he being one, and what work his Father doth
   he doing the same.

   And this is the account which this "mere Christian" giveth us
   concerning his faith in Christ, his person, and his grace: He is a mere
   man, that neither satisfied for our sins nor procured grace or heaven
   for us; and how much this tends to the honour of Christ and the good of
   souls, all that love him in sincerity will judge and determine.

   His next attempt is upon the way whereby the Scripture affirms that we
   come to be made partakers of the good things which Christ hath done and
   wrought for us; and in the first place he falls foul upon that of
   apprehending and applying Christ's righteousness to ourselves by faith,
   that so there may no weighty point of the doctrine of the cross remain
   not condemned (by this wise man) of folly. This, then, goes also, name
   and thing: Christ is "of God made unto us righteousness" (that is, "to
   them that believe on him," or "receive" or "apprehend" him, John i.
   12), God "having set him forth to be a propitiation through faith in
   his blood, to declare his righteousness for the forgiveness of sins,"
   and declaring that every one who "believeth in him is justified from
   all things from which he could not be justified by the law," God
   imputing righteousness to them that so believe; those who are so
   justified by faith having peace with God. It being the great thing we
   have to aim at, namely, that "we may know Jesus Christ, and the
   fellowship of his sufferings, and the power of his resurrection, and be
   found in him, not having our own righteousness, which is of the law,
   but the righteousness which is by the faith of Christ, Christ being the
   end of the law to every one that believeth," [142] we say it is the
   duty of every one who is called, to apprehend Christ by faith, and
   apply his righteousness to him; that is, to believe on him as "made the
   righteousness of God to him," unto justification and peace. And if Mr
   B. reject this doctrine, name and thing, I pray God give him repentance
   before it be too late, to the acknowledgment of the truth.

   Of Christ's being our surety, of Christ's paying our debt, of our sins
   imputed to Christ, of Christ's righteousness imputed to us, of Christ
   dying to appease the wrath of God and reconcile him to us, enough hath
   been spoken already to clear the meaning of them who use these
   expressions, and to manifest the truth of that which they intend by
   them, so that I shall not need again to consider them as they lie in
   this disorderly, confused heap which we have here gathered together.

   Our justification by Christ being cashiered, he falls upon our
   sanctification in the next place, that he may leave us as little of
   Christians as he hath done our Saviour of the true Messiah. Infused
   grace is first assaulted. The various acceptations of the word "grace"
   in the Scripture this is no place to insist upon. By "grace infused" we
   mean grace really bestowed upon us, and abiding in us, from the Spirit
   of God. That a new spiritual life or principle, enabling men to live to
   God, -- that new, gracious, heavenly qualities and endowments, as
   light, love, joy, faith, etc., bestowed on men, -- are called "grace"
   and "graces of the Spirit," [143] I suppose will not be denied. These
   we call "infused grace" and "graces;" that is, we say God works these
   things in us by his Spirit, giving us a "new heart and a new spirit,
   putting his law into our hearts, quickening us who were dead in
   trespasses and sins, making us light who were darkness, filling us with
   the fruits of the Spirit in joy, meekness, faith, which are not of
   ourselves but the gifts of God." [144] Mr B. having before disclaimed
   all original sin, or the depravation of our nature by sin, in deadness,
   darkness, obstinacy, etc., thought it also incumbent on him to disown
   and disallow all reparation of it by grace; and all this under the name
   of a "mere Christian," not knowing that he discovereth a frame of
   spirit utterly unacquainted with the main things of Christianity.

   Free grace is next doomed to rejection. That all the grace, mercy,
   goodness of God, in our election, redemption, calling, sanctification,
   pardon, and salvation, is free, not deserved, not merited, nor by us
   any way procured, -- that God doth all that he doth for us bountifully,
   fully, freely, of his own love and grace, -- is affirmed in this
   expression, and intended thereby. And is this found neither name nor
   thing in the Scriptures? Is there no mention of "God's loving us
   freely; of his blotting out our sins for his own sake, for his name's
   sake; of his giving his Son for us from his own love; of faith being
   not of ourselves, being the gift of God; of his saving us, not
   according to the works of righteousness which we have done, but of his
   own mercy; of his justifying us by his grace, begetting us of his own
   will, having mercy on whom he will have mercy; of a covenant not like
   the old, wherein he hath promised to be merciful to our
   unrighteousness," etc.? [145] or is it possible that a man assuming to
   himself the name of a Christian should be ignorant of the doctrine of
   the free grace of God, or oppose it and yet profess not to reject the
   gospel as a fable? But this was, and ever will be, the condemnation of
   some, that "light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather
   than light."

   About the next expression, of the world of the elect, I shall not
   contend. That by the name of "the world" (which term is used in the
   Scriptures in great variety of significations), the elect, as being in
   and of this visible world, and by nature no better than the rest of the
   inhabitants thereof, are sometimes peculiarly intended, is proved
   elsewhere, [146] beyond whatever Mr B. is able to oppose thereunto.

   Of the irresistible working of the Spirit, in bringing men to believe,
   the condition is otherwise. About the term "irresistible" I know none
   that care much to strive. That "faith is the gift of God, not of
   ourselves, that it is wrought in us by the exceeding greatness of the
   power of God; that in bestowing it upon us by his Spirit (that is, in
   our conversion), God effectually creates a new heart in us, makes us
   new creatures, quickens us, raises us from the dead, working in us to
   will and to do of his own good pleasure; as he commanded light to shine
   out of darkness, so shining into our hearts, to give us the knowledge
   of his glory; [147] begetting us anew of his own will," so irresistibly
   causing us to believe, because he effectually works faith in us, -- is
   the sum of what Mr B. here rejecteth, that he might be sure, as before,
   to leave nothing of weight in Christian religion uncondemned. But these
   trifles and falsities being renounced, he complains of the abuse of his
   darling, that it is called carnal reason; which being the only
   interpreter of Scripture which he allows of, he cannot but take it
   amiss that it should be so grossly slandered as to be called "carnal."
   The Scripture, indeed, tells us of a "natural man, that cannot discern
   the things which are of God, and that they are foolishness to him; of a
   carnal mind, that is enmity to God, and not like to have any reasons or
   reasonings but what are carnal; of a wisdom that is carnal, sensual,
   and devilish; [148] of a wisdom that God will destroy and confound;"
   and that such is the best of the wisdom and reason of all unregenerate
   persons; -- but why the reason of a man in such a state, with such a
   mind about the things of God, should be called "carnal," Mr B. can see
   no reason; and some men, perhaps, will be apt to think that it is
   because all his reason is still carnal. When a man is "renewed after
   the image of him that created him" he is made "spiritual, light in the
   Lord," every thought and imagination that sets up itself in his heart
   in opposition to God being led captive to the obedience of the gospel.
   We acknowledge a sanctified reason in such an one of that use in the
   dijudication of the things of God as shall afterward be declared.

   Spiritual desertions are nextly decried. Some poor souls would thank
   him to make good this discovery. They find mention in the Scripture of
   "God's hiding his face, withdrawing himself, forsaking, though but for
   a moment," and of them that on this account "walk in darkness and see
   no light, that seek him and find him not, but are filled with troubles,
   terrors, arrows from him," etc. [149] And this, in some measure, they
   find to be the condition of their own souls. They have not the life,
   light, power, joy, consolation, sense of God's love, as formerly; and
   therefore they think there are spiritual desertions, and that in
   respect of their souls these dispensations of God are signally and
   significantly so termed; and they fear that those who deny all
   desertions never had any enjoyments from or of God.

   Of spiritual incomes there is the same reason. It is not the phrase of
   speech, but the thing itself, we contend about. That God who is the
   Father of mercy and God of all consolation gives mercy, grace, joy,
   peace, consolation, as to whom, so in what manner or in what degree he
   pleaseth. The receiving of these from God is by some (and that,
   perhaps, not inaptly) termed "spiritual incomes," with regard to God's
   gracious distributions of his kindness, love, good-will and the
   receiving of them. So that it be acknowledged that we do receive grace,
   mercy, joy, consolation, and peace from God, variously as he pleaseth,
   we shall not much labour about the significancy of that or any other
   expression of the like kind. The Scriptures mentioning the "goings
   forth of God," Mic. v. 2, leave no just cause to Mr B. of condemning
   them who sometimes call any of his works or dispensations his
   outgoings.

   His rehearsal of all these particular instances, in doctrines that are
   found neither name nor thing in Scripture, Mr B. closeth with an
   "etc.;" which might be interpreted to comprise as many more, but that
   there remain not as many more important heads in Christian religion.
   The nature of God being abased, the deity and grace of Christ denied,
   the sin of our natures and their renovation by grace in Christ
   rejected, Mr B.'s remaining religion will be found scarce worth the
   inquiry after by those whom he undertakes to instruct, there being
   scarcely any thing left by him from whence we are peculiarly
   denominated Christians, nor any thing that should support the weight of
   a sinful soul which approacheth to God for life and salvation.

   To prevent the entertainment of such doctrines as these, Mr B. commends
   the advice of Paul, 2 Tim. i. 13, "Hold fast the form of sound words,"
   etc.; than which we know none more wholesome nor more useful for the
   safeguarding and defence of those holy and heavenly principles of our
   religion which Mr B. rejects and tramples on. Nor are we at all
   concerned in his following discourse of leaving Scripture terms, and
   using phrases and expressions coined by men; for if we use any word or
   phrase in the things of God and his worship, and cannot make good the
   thing signified thereby to be founded on and found in the Scriptures,
   we will instantly renounce it. But if indeed the words and expressions
   used by any of the ancients for the explication and confirmation of the
   faith of the gospel, especially of the doctrine concerning the person
   of Christ, in the vindication of it from the heretics which in sundry
   ages bestirred themselves (as Mr B. now doth) in opposition thereunto,
   be found/ consonant to Scripture, and to signify nothing but what is
   written therein with the beams of the sun, perhaps we see more cause to
   retain them, from the opposition here made to them by Mr B., than
   formerly we did, considering that his opposition to words and phrases
   is not for their own sake, but of the things intended by them.

   The similitude of "the ship that lost its first matter and substance by
   the addition of new pieces, in way of supplement to the old decays,"
   having been used by some of our divines to illustrate the Roman
   apostasy and traditional additionals to the doctrines of the gospel,
   will not stand Mr B. in the least stead, unless he be able to prove
   that we have lost, in the religion we profess, any one material part of
   what it was when given over to the churches by Christ and his apostles,
   or have added any one particular to what they have provided and
   furnished us withal in the Scriptures; which until he hath done, by
   these and the like insinuations he doth but beg the thing in question;
   which, being a matter of so great consequence and importance as it is,
   will scarce be granted him on any such terms. I doubt not but it will
   appear to every person whatsoever, in the process of this business, who
   hath his senses any thing exercised in the word to discern between good
   and evil, and whose eyes the god of this world hath not blinded, that
   the glorious light of the gospel of God should not shine into their
   hearts, that Mr B., as wise as he deems and reports himself to be, is
   indeed, like the foolish woman that pulls down her house with both her
   hands, labouring to destroy the house of God with all his strength,
   pretending that this and that part of it did not originally belong
   thereto (or like Ajax, in his madness, who killed sheep, and supposed
   they had been his enemies [150] ), upon the account of that enmity
   which he finds in his own mind unto them.

   The close of Mr B.'s preface contains an exhortation to the study of
   the word, with an account of the success he himself hath obtained in
   the search thereof, both in the detection of errors and the discovery
   of sundry truths. Some things I shall remark upon that discourse, and
   shut up these considerations of his preface:--

   For his own success, he tells us "That being otherwise of no great
   abilities, yet searching the Scriptures impartially, he hath detected
   many errors, and hath presented the reader with a body of religion from
   the Scriptures; which whoso shall well ruminate and digest will be
   enabled," etc.

   As for Mr B.'s abilities, I have not any thing to do to call them into
   question: whether small or great, he will one day find that he hath
   scarce used them to the end for which he is intrusted with them; and
   when the Lord of his talents shall call for an account, it will scarce
   be comfortable to him that he hath engaged them so much to his
   dishonour as it will undoubtedly appear he hath done. I have heard, by
   those of Mr B.'s time and acquaintance in the university, that what
   ability he had then obtained, were it more or less, he still delighted
   to be exercising of it in opposition to received truths in philosophy;
   and whether an itching desire of novelty, and of emerging thereby, lie
   not at the bottom of the course he hath since steered, he may do well
   to examine himself.

   What errors he hath detected (though but pretended such, which honour
   in the next place he assumes to himself) I know not. The error of the
   deity of Christ was detected in the apostles' days by Ebion Cerinthus,
   and others, [151] -- not long after by Paulus Samosatenus, by Photinus,
   by Arius, and others; [152] the error of the purity, simplicity, and
   spirituality of the essence of God, by Audseus and the
   Anthropomorphites; the error of the deity of the Holy Ghost was long
   since detected by Macedonius and his companions; the error of original
   sin, or the corruption of our nature, by Pelagius; the error of the
   satisfaction and merit of Christ, by Abelardus; all of them, by
   Socinus, Smalcius, Crellius, etc. What new discoveries Mr B. hath made
   I know not, nor is there any thing that he presents us with, in his
   whole body of religion, as stated in his questions, but what he hath
   found prepared, digested, and modelled to his hand by his masters, the
   Socinians, unless it be some few gross notions about the Deity; nor is
   so much as the language which here he useth of himself and his
   discoveries his own, but borrowed of Socinus, Ep. ad Squarcialupum.

   We have not, then, the least reason in the world to suppose that Mr B.
   was led into these glorious discoveries by reading of the Scriptures,
   much less by "impartial reading of them;" but that they are all the
   fruits of a deluded heart, given up righteously of God to believe a
   lie, for the neglect of his word and contempt of reliance upon his
   Spirit and grace for a right understanding thereof, by the cunning
   sleights of the forementioned persons, in some of whose writings Satan
   lies in wait to deceive. And for the "body of religion" which he hath
   collected, which lies not in the answers, which are set down in the
   words of the Scripture, but in the interpretations and conclusions
   couched in his questions, I may safely say it is one of the most
   corrupt and abominable that ever issued from the endeavours of one who
   called himself a Christian; for a proof of which assertion I refer the
   reader to the ensuing considerations of it. So that whatever promises
   of success Mr B. is pleased to make unto him who shall ruminate and
   digest in his mind this body of his composure (it being, indeed, stark
   poison, that will never be digested, but will fill and swell the heart
   with pride and venom until it utterly destroy the whole person), it may
   justly be feared that he hath given too great an advantage to a sort of
   men in the world, not behind Mr B. for abilities and reason (the only
   guide allowed by him in affairs of this nature), to decry the use and
   reading of the Scripture, which they see unstable and unlearned men
   fearfully to wrest to their own destruction. But let God be true, and
   all men liars. Let the gospel run and prosper; and if it be hid to any,
   it is to them whom the god of this world hath blinded, that the
   glorious light thereof should not shine into their hearts.

   What may farther be drawn forth of the same kind with what is in these
   Catechisms delivered, with an imposition of it upon the Scripture, as
   though any occasion were thence administered thereunto, I know not, but
   yet do suppose that Satan himself is scarce able to furnish the
   thoughts of men with many more abominations of the like length and
   breadth with those here endeavoured to be imposed on simple, unstable
   souls, unless he should engage them into downright atheism and
   professed contempt of God.

   Of what tendency these doctrines of Mr B. are unto godliness, which he
   next mentioneth, will in its proper place fall under consideration. It
   is true, the gospel is a "doctrine according to godliness," and aims at
   the promotion of it in the hearts and lives of men, in order to the
   exaltation of the glory of God; and hence it is that so soon as any
   poor deluded soul falls into the snare of Satan, and is taken captive
   under the power of any error whatever, the first sleight he puts in
   practice for the promotion of it is to declaim about its excellency and
   usefulness for the furtherance of godliness, though himself in the
   meantime be under the power of darkness, and knows not in the least
   what belongs to the godliness which he professeth to promote. As to
   what Mr B. here draws forth to that purpose, I shall be bold to tell
   him that to the accomplishment of a godliness amongst men (since the
   fall of Adam) that hath not its rise and foundation in the effectual,
   powerful changing of the whole man from death to life, darkness to
   light, etc., in the washing off the pollutions of nature by the blood
   of Christ; that is not wrought in us and carried on by the efficacy of
   the Spirit of grace, taking away the heart of stone and giving a new
   heart circumcised to fear the Lord; that is not purchased and procured
   for us by the oblation and intercession of the Lord Jesus; a godliness
   that is not promoted by the consideration of the viciousness and
   corruption of our hearts by nature, and their alienation from God, and
   that doth not in a good part of it consist in the mortifying, killing,
   slaying of the sin of nature that dwelleth in us, and in an opposition
   to all the actings and workings of it; a godliness that is performed by
   our own strength in yielding obedience to the precepts of the word,
   that by that obedience we may be justified before God and for it
   accepted, etc., -- there is not one tittle, letter, nor iota, in the
   whole book of God tending.

   Mr B. closeth his preface with a commendation of the Scriptures, their
   excellency and divinity, with the eminent success that they shall find
   who yield obedience to them, in that they shall be, "even in this life,
   equal unto angels." His expressions, at first view, seem to separate
   him from his companions in his body of divinity, which he pretends to
   collect from the Scriptures, whose low thoughts and bold expressions
   concerning the contradictions in them shall afterward be pointed unto;
   but I fear "latet anguis in herba:" and in this kiss of the Scriptures,
   with "hail" unto them, there is vile treachery intended, and the
   betraying of them into the hands of men, to be dealt withal at their
   pleasure. I desire not to entertain evil surmises of any (what just
   occasion soever be given on any other account) concerning things that
   have not their evidence and conviction in themselves. The bleating of
   that expression, "The Scriptures are the exactest rule of a holy life,
   evidently allowing other rules of a holy life, though they be the
   exactest, and admitting other things or books into a copartnership with
   them in that their use and service, though the preeminence be given to
   them, sounds as much to their dishonour as any thing spoken of them by
   any who ever owned them to have proceeded from God. It is the glory of
   the Scriptures, not only to be the rule, but the only one, of walking
   with God. If you take any others into comparison with it, and allow
   them in the trial to be rules indeed, though not so exact as the
   Scripture, you do no less cast down the Scripture from its excellency
   than if you denied it to be any rule at all. It will not lie as one of
   the many, though you say never so often that it is the best. What
   issues there will be of the endeavour to give reason the absolute
   sovereignty in judging of rules of holiness, allowing others, but
   preferring the Scripture, and therein, without other assistance,
   determining of all the contents of it, in order to its utmost end, God
   in due time will manifest. We confess (to close with Mr B.) that true
   obedience to the Scriptures makes men, even in this life, equal in some
   sense unto angels; not upon the account of their performance of that
   obedience merely, as though there could be an equality between the
   obedience yielded by us whilst we are yet sinners, and continue so (for
   "if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves"), and the exact
   obedience of them who never sinned, but abide in doing the will of God:
   but the principal and main work of God required in them, and which is
   the root of all other obedience whatever, being to "believe on him whom
   he hath sent," to "as many as so believe on him and so receive him
   power is given to become the sons of God;" who being so adopted into
   the great family of heaven and earth, which is called after God's name,
   and invested with all the privileges thereof, having fellowship with
   the Father and the Son, they are in that regard, even in this life,
   equal to angels.

   Having thus, as briefly as I could, washed off the paint that was put
   upon the porch of Mr B.'s fabric, and discovered it to be a composure
   of rotten posts and dead men's bones, -- whose pargeting being removed,
   their abomination lies naked to all, -- I shall enter the building or
   heap itself, to consider what entertainment he hath provided therein
   for those whom, in the entrance, he doth so subtilely and earnestly
   invite to turn in and partake of his provisions.

Chapter I.

   Mr Biddle's first chapter examined -- Of the Scriptures.

   Mr Biddle having imposed upon himself the task of insinuating his
   abominations by applying the express words of Scripture in way of
   answer to his captious and sophistical queries, was much straitened in
   the very entrance, in that he could not find any text or tittle in them
   that is capable of being wrested to give the least colour to those
   imperfections which the residue of men with whom he is, in the whole
   system of his doctrine, in compliance and communion, do charge them
   withal: as, that there are contradictions in them, though in things of
   less importance; [153] that many things are or may be changed and
   altered in them; that some of the books of the Old Testament are lost;
   and that those that remain are not of any necessity to Christians,
   although they may be read with profit. Their subjecting them, also, and
   all their assertions, to the last judgment of reason, is of the same
   nature with the other. But it not being my purpose to pursue his
   opinions through all the secret windings and turnings of them, so [as]
   to drive them to their proper issue, but only to discover the sophistry
   and falseness of those insinuations which grossly and palpably
   overthrow the foundations of Christianity, I shall not force him to
   speak to any thing beyond what he hath expressly delivered himself
   unto.

   This first chapter then, concerning the Scriptures, both in the Greater
   and Less Catechisms, without farther trouble I shall pass over, seeing
   that the stating of the questions and answers in them may be sound, and
   according to the common faith of the saints, in those who partake not
   with Mr B.'s companions in their low thoughts of them, which here he
   doth not profess; only, I dare not join with him in his last assertion,
   that such and such passages are the most affectionate in the book of
   God, seeing we know but in part, and are not enabled nor warranted to
   make such peremptory determinations concerning the several passages of
   Scripture, set in comparison and competition for affectionateness by
   ourselves.

Chapter II.

   Of the nature of God.

   His second chapter, which is concerning God, his essence, nature, and
   properties, is second to none in his whole book for blasphemies and
   reproaches of God and his word.

   The description of God which he labours to insinuate is, that he is
   "one person, of a visible shape and similitude, finite, limited to a
   certain place, mutable, comprehensible, and obnoxious to turbulent
   passions, not knowing the things that are future and which shall be
   done by the sons of men; whom none can love with all his heart, if he
   believe him to be one in three distinct persons.'?"

   That this is punctually the apprehension and notion concerning God and
   his being which he labours to beget, by his suiting Scripture
   expressions to the blasphemous insinuations of his questions, will
   appear in the consideration of both questions and answers, as they lie
   in the second chapter of the Greater Catechism.

   His first question is, "How many Gods of Christians are there?" and his
   answer is, "One God," Eph. iv. 6; whereunto he subjoins secondly, "Who
   is this one God?" and answers, "The Father, of whom are all things," 1
   Cor. viii. 6.

   That the intendment of the connection of these queries, and the suiting
   of words of Scripture to them, is to insinuate some thoughts against
   the doctrine of the Trinity, is not questionable, especially being the
   work of him that makes it his business to oppose it and laugh it to
   scorn. With what success this attempt is managed, a little
   consideration of what is offered will evince. It is true, Paul says,
   "To us there is one God," treating of the vanity and nothingness of the
   idols of the heathen, whom God hath threatened to deprive of all
   worship and to starve out of the world. The question as here proposed,
   "How many Gods of Christians are there?" having no such occasion
   administered unto it as that expression of Paul, being no parcel of
   such a discourse as he insists upon, sounds pleasantly towards the
   allowance of many gods, though Christians have but one. Neither is Mr
   B. so averse to polytheism as not to give occasion, on other accounts,
   to this supposal. Jesus Christ he allows to be a god. All his
   companions, in the undertaking against his truly eternal divine nature,
   still affirm him to be "Homo Deificatus" and "Deus Factus," [154] and
   plead "pro vera deitate Jesu Christi," denying yet, with him, that by
   nature he is God, of the same essence with the Father; so, indeed,
   grossly and palpably falling into and closing with that abomination
   which they pretend above all men to avoid, in their opposition to the
   thrice holy and blessed Trinity. Of those monstrous figments in
   Christian religion which on this occasion they have introduced, of
   making a man to be an eternal God, of worshipping a mere creature with
   the worship due only to the infinitely blessed God, we shall speak
   afterward.

   We confess that to us there is one God, but one God, and let all others
   be accursed. "The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth,"
   let them be destroyed, according to the word of the Lord, "from under
   these heavens," Jer. x. 11. Yet we say, moreover, that "there are three
   that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost;
   and these three are one," 1 John v. 7. And in that very place whence Mr
   B. cuts off his first answer, as it is asserted that there is "one
   God," so "one Lord" and "one Spirit," the fountain of all spiritual
   distributions, are mentioned; which whether they are not also that one
   God, we shall have farther occasion to consider.

   To the next query concerning this one God, who he is, the words are,
   "The Father, from whom are all things;" in themselves most true. The
   Father is the one God whom we worship in spirit and in truth; and yet
   the Son also is "our Lord and our God," John xx. 28, even "God over
   all, blessed for ever," Rom. ix. 5. The Spirit also is the God "which
   worketh all in all," 1 Cor. xii. 6, 11. And in the name of that one
   God, who is the "Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," are we baptized, whom we
   serve, who to us is the one God over all, Matt. xxviii. 19. Neither is
   that assertion of the Father's being the one and only true God any more
   prejudicial to the Son's being so also, than that testimony given to
   the everlasting deity of the Son is to that of the Father,
   notwithstanding that to us there is but one God. The intendment of our
   author in these questions is to answer what he found in the great
   exemplar of his Catechism, the Racovian, two of whose questions are
   comprehensive of all that is here delivered and intended by Mr B. [155]
   But of these things more afterward.

   His next inquiry is after the nature of this one God, which he answers
   with that of our Saviour in John iv. 24, "God is a spirit." In this he
   is somewhat more modest, though not so wary as his great master,
   Faustus Socinus, and his disciple (as to his notions about the nature
   of God) Vorstius. His acknowledgment of God to be a spirit frees him
   from sharing in impudence in this particular with his master, who will
   not allow any such thing to be asserted in these words of our Saviour.
   His words are (Fragment. Disput. de Adorat. Christi cum Christiano
   Franken, p. 60), "Non est fortasse eorum verborum ea sententia, quam
   plerique omnes arbitrantur: Deum scilicet esse spiritum, neque enim
   subaudiendum esse dicit aliquis verbum esti, quasi vox pneuma, recto
   casu accipienda sit, sed apo koinou repetendum verbum zetei quod paulo
   ante præcessit, et pneuma quarto casu accipiendum, ita ut sententia
   sit, Deum quærere et postulare spiritum." Vorstius also follows him,
   Not. ad Disput. 3, p. 200. Because the verb substantive "is" is not in
   the original expressed (than the omission whereof nothing being more
   frequent, though I have heard of one who, from the like omission, 2
   Cor. v. 17, thought to have proved Christ to be the "new creature"
   there intended), contrary to the context and coherence of the words,
   design of the argument in hand insisted on by our Saviour (as he was a
   bold man), and emphaticalness of significancy in the expression as it
   lies, he will needs thrust in the word "seeketh," and render the
   intention of Christ to be, that God seeks a spirit, that is, the spirit
   of men, to worship him. Herein, I say, is Mr B. more modest than his
   master (as, it seems, following Crellius, [156] who in the exposition
   of that place of Scripture is of another mind), though in craft and
   foresight he be outgone by him; for if God be a spirit indeed, one of a
   pure spiritual essence and substance, the image, shape, and similitude,
   which he afterwards ascribes to him, his corporeal posture, which he
   asserts (ques. 4), will scarcely be found suitable unto him. It is
   incumbent on some kind of men to be very wary in what they say, and
   mindful of what they have said; falsehood hath no consistency in
   itself, no more than with the truth. Smalcius in the Racovian Catechism
   is utterly silent as to this question and answer. But the consideration
   of this also will in its due place succeed.

   To his fourth query, about a farther description of God by some of his
   attributes, I shall not need to subjoin any thing in way of
   animadversion; for however the texts he cites come short of delivering
   that of God which the import of the question to which they are annexed
   doth require, yet being not wrested to give countenance to any perverse
   apprehension of his nature, I shall not need to insist upon the
   consideration of them.

   Ques. 5, he falls closely to his work, in these words, "Is not God,
   according to the current of the Scriptures, in a certain place, namely,
   in heaven?" whereunto he answers by many places of Scripture that make
   mention of God in heaven.

   That we may not mistake his mind and intention in this query, some
   light may be taken from some other passages in his book. In the preface
   he tells you "That God hath a similitude and shape" (of which
   afterward), "and hath his place in the heavens" (that "God is in no
   certain place," he reckons amongst those errors he opposes, in the same
   preface; of the same kind he asserteth the belief to be of God's "being
   infinite and incomprehensible);" and, Cat. Less. p. 6, "That God
   glisteneth with glory, and is resident in a certain place of the
   heavens, so that one may distinguish between his right and left hand by
   bodily sight." This is the doctrine of the man with whom we have to do
   concerning the presence of God. "He is," saith he, "in heaven, as in a
   certain place." That which is in a certain place is finite and limited,
   as, from the nature of a place and the manner of any thing's being in a
   place, shall be instantly evinced. God, then, is finite and limited; be
   it so (that he is infinite and incomprehensible is yet a Scripture
   expression): yea, he is so limited as not to be extended to the whole
   compass and limit of the heavens, but he is in a certain place of the
   heavens, yea, so circumscribed as that a man may see from his right
   hand to his left; -- wherein Mr B. comes short of Mohammed, who affirms
   that when he was taken into heaven to the sight of God, he found three
   days' journey between his eye-brows; which if so, it will be somewhat
   hard for any one to see from his right hand to his left, being supposed
   at an answerable distance to that of his eye-brows. Let us see, then,
   on what testimony, by what authority, Mr B. doth here limit the
   Almighty and confine him to a certain place, shutting up his essence
   and being in some certain part of the heavens, cutting him thereby
   short, as we shall see in the issue, in all those eternal perfections
   whereby hitherto he hath been known to the sons of men.

   The proof of that lies in the places of Scripture which, making mention
   of God, say, "he is in heaven," and that "he looketh down from heaven,"
   etc.; of which, out of some concordance, some twenty or thirty are by
   him repeated. Not to make long work of a short business, the Scriptures
   say, "God is in heaven." Who ever denied it? But do the Scriptures say
   he is nowhere else? Do the Scriptures say he is confined to heaven, so
   that he is so there as not to be in all other places? If Mr B. thinks
   this any argument, "God is in heaven, therefore his essence is not
   infinite and immense, therefore he is not everywhere," we are not of
   his mind. He tells you, in his preface, that he "asserts nothing
   himself." I presume his reason was, lest any should call upon him for a
   proof of his assertions. What he intends to insinuate, and what
   conceptions of God he labours to ensnare the minds of unlearned and
   unstable souls withal, in this question under consideration, hath been,
   from the evidence of his intendment therein, and the concurrent
   testimony of other expressions of his to the same purpose,
   demonstrated. To propose any thing directly in way of proof of the
   truth of that which he labours insensibly to draw the minds of men
   unto, he was doubtless conscious to himself of so much disability for
   its performance as to waive that kind of procedure; and therefore his
   whole endeavour is, having filled, animated, and spirited the
   understandings of men with the notion couched in his question, to cast
   in some Scripture expressions, that, as they lie, may seem fitted to
   the fixing of the notion before begotten in them. As to any attempt of
   direct proof of what he would hare confirmed, the man of reason is
   utterly silent.

   None of those texts of Scripture where mention is made of God's being
   in heaven are, in the coherence and dependence of speech wherein they
   lie, suited or intended at all to give answer to this question, or any
   like it, concerning the presence of God or his actual existence in any
   place, but only in respect of some dispensations of God and works of
   his, whose fountain and original he would have us to consider in
   himself, and to come forth from him there where in an eminent manner he
   manifests his glory. God is, I say, in none of the places by him urged
   said to be in heaven in respect of his essence or being, nor is it the
   intention of the Holy Ghost in any of them to declare the manner of
   God's essential presence and existence in reference to all or any
   place; but only by the way of eminency, in respect of manifestations of
   himself and operations from his glorious presence, doth he so speak of
   him. And, indeed, in those expressions, heaven doth not so much signify
   a place as a thing, or at least a place in reference to the things
   there done, or the peculiar manifestations of the glory of God there;
   so that if these places should be made use of as to the proof of the
   figment insinuated, the argument from them would be a non causa pro
   causa. The reason why God is said to be in heaven is, not because his
   essence is included in a certain place so called, but because of the
   more eminent manifestations of his glory there, and the regard which he
   requires to be had of him manifesting his glory as the first cause and
   author of all the works which outwardly are of him.

   3. God is said to be in heaven in an especial manner, because he hath
   assigned that as the place of the saints' expectation of that enjoyment
   and eternal fruition of himself which he hath promised to bless them
   withal; but for the limiting of his essence to a certain place in
   heaven, the Scriptures, as we shall see, know nothing, yea, expressly
   and positively affirm the contrary.

   Let us all, then, supply our catechumens, in the room of Mr B.'s, with
   this question, expressly leading to the things inquired after:-- What
   says the Scripture concerning the essence and presence of God? is it
   confined and limited to a certain place, or is he infinitely and
   equally present everywhere?

   Ans. "The Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth
   beneath," Josh. ii. 11. "But will God indeed dwell on the earth?
   behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much
   less this house that I have builded?" 1 Kings viii. 27. "Whither shall
   I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I
   ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell,
   behold, thou art there," etc., Ps. cxxxix. 7-10. "The heaven is my
   throne, and the earth is my footstool," Isa. lxvi. 1, Acts vii. 47, 48.
   "Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off? Can any
   hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord.
   Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord," Jer. xxiii. 23, 24.

   It is of the ubiquity and omnipresence of God that these places
   expressly treat; and whereas it was manifested before that the
   expression of God being in heaven doth not at all speak to the
   abomination which Mr B. would insinuate thereby, the naked rehearsal of
   those testimonies, so directly asserting and ascribing to the Almighty
   an infinite, unlimited presence, and that in direct opposition to the
   gross apprehension of his being confined to a certain place in heaven,
   is abundantly sufficient to deliver the thoughts and minds of men from
   any entanglements that Mr B.'s questions and answers (for though it be
   the word of the Scripture he insists upon, yet male dum recitas incipit
   esse tuum) might lead them into. On that account no more need be added;
   but yet this occasion being administered, that truth itself, concerning
   the omnipresence or ubiquity of God, may be farther cleared and
   confirmed.

   Through the prejudices and ignorance of men, it is inquired whether God
   be so present in any certain place as not to be also equally elsewhere,
   everywhere?

   Place has been commonly defined to be "superficies corporis ambientis."
   Because of sundry inextricable difficulties and the impossibility of
   suiting it to every place, this definition is now generally decried.
   That now commonly received is more natural, suited to the natures of
   things, and obvious to the understanding. A place is "spatium corporis
   susceptivum," -- any space wherein a body may be received and
   contained. The first consideration of it is as to its fitness and
   aptness so to receive any body: so it is in the imagination only. The
   second, as to its actual existence, being filled with that body which
   it is apt to receive: so may we imagine innumerable spaces in heaven
   which are apt and able to receive the bodies of the saints, and which
   actually shall be filled with them when they shall be translated
   thereunto by the power of God.

   Presence in a place is the actual existence of a person in his place,
   or, as logicians speak, in his ubi, that is, answering the inquiry
   after him where he is. Though all bodies are in certain places, yet per
   sons only are said to be present in them. Other things have not
   properly a presence to be ascribed to them; they are in their proper
   places, but we do not say they are present in or to their places.

   This being the general description of a place and the presence of any
   therein, it is evident that properly it cannot be spoken at all of God
   that he is in one place or other, for he is not a body that should fill
   up the space of its receipt, nor yet in all places, taking the word
   properly, for so one essence can be but in one place; and if the word
   should properly be ascribed to God in any sense, it would deprive him
   of all his infinite perfections.

   It is farther said that there be three ways of the presence of any in
   reference to a place or places. Some are so in a place as to be
   circumscribed therein in respect of their parts and dimensions, such
   are their length, breadth, and depth: so doth one part of them fit one
   part of the place wherein they are, and the whole the whole; so are all
   solid bodies in a place; so is a man, his whole body in his whole
   place, his head in one part of it, his arms in another. Some are so
   conceived to be in a place as that, in relation to it, it may be said
   of them that they are there in it so as not to be anywhere else, though
   they have not parts and dimensions filling the place wherein they are,
   nor are punctually circumscribed with a local space: such is the
   presence of angels and spirits to the places wherein they are, being
   not infinite or immense. These are so in some certain place as not to
   be at the same time, wherein they are so, without it, or elsewhere, or
   in any other place. And this is proper to all finite, immaterial
   substances, that are so in a place as not to occupy and fill up that
   space wherein they are. In respect of place, God is immense, and
   indistant to all things and places, absent from nothing, no place,
   contained in none; present to all by and in his infinite essence and
   being, exerting his power variously, in any or all places, as he
   pleaseth, revealing and manifesting his glory more or less, as it
   seemeth good to him.

   Of this omnipresence of God, two things are usually inquired after: 1.
   The thing itself, or the demonstration that he is so omnipresent; 2.
   The manner of it, or the manifestation and declaring how he is so
   present. Of this latter, perhaps, sundry things have been over
   curiously and nicely by some disputed, though, upon a thorough search,
   their disputes may not appear altogether useless. The schoolmen's
   distinctions of God's being in a place repletivè, immensivè, impletivè,
   superexcedenter, conservativè, attinctive, manifestative, etc. have,
   some of them at least, foundation in the Scriptures and right reason.
   That which seems most obnoxious to exception is their assertion of God
   to be everywhere present, instar puncti; but the sense of that and its
   intendment is, to express how God is not in a place, rather than how he
   is. He is not in a place as quantitive bodies, that have the dimensions
   attending them. Neither could his presence in heaven, by those who shut
   him up there, be any otherwise conceived, until they were relieved by
   the rare notions of Mr B. concerning the distinct places of his right
   hand and left. But it is not at all about the manner of God's presence
   that I am occasioned to speak, but only of the thing itself. They who
   say he is in heaven only speak as to the thing, and not as to the
   manner of it. When we say he is everywhere, our assertion is also to be
   interpreted as to that only; the manner of his presence being purely of
   a philosophical consideration, his presence itself divinely revealed,
   and necessarily attending his divine perfections; yea, it is an
   essential property of God. The properties of God are either absolute or
   relative. The absolute properties of God are such as may be considered
   without the supposition of any thing else whatever, towards which their
   energy and efficacy should be exerted. His relative are such as, in
   their egress and exercise, respect some things in the creatures, though
   they naturally and eternally reside in God. Of the first sort is God's
   immensity; it is an absolute property of his nature and being. For God
   to be immense, infinite, unbounded, unlimited, is as necessary to him
   as to be God; that is, it is of his essential perfection so to be. The
   ubiquity of God, or his presence to all things and persons, is a
   relative property of God; for to say that God is present in and to all
   things supposes those things to be. Indeed, the ubiquity of God is the
   habitude of his immensity to the creation. Supposing the creatures, the
   world that is, God is by reason of his immensity in-distant to them
   all; or if more worlds be supposed (as all things possible to the power
   of God without any absurdity may be supposed), on the same account as
   he is omnipresent in reference to the present world, he would be so to
   them and all that is in them.

   Of that which we affirm in this matter this is the sum: God, who in his
   own being and essence is infinite and immense, is, by reason thereof,
   present in and to the whole creation equally, -- not by a diffusion of
   his substance, or mixture with other things, heaven or earth, in or
   upon them, but by an inconceivable indistancy of essence to all things,
   -- though he exert his power and manifest his glory in one place more
   than another; as in heaven, in Zion, at the ark, etc.

   That this is the doctrine of the Scriptures in the places before
   mentioned needs no great pains to evince. In that, 1 Kings viii. 27,
   the design of Solomon in the words gives light to the substance of what
   he asserted. He had newly, with labour, cost, charge, and wisdom, none
   of them to be paralleled in the world, built a temple for the worship
   of God. The house being large and exceedingly glorious, the
   apprehensions of all the nations round about (that looked on, and
   considered the work he had in hand) concerning the nature and being of
   God being gross, carnal, and superstitious, themselves answerably
   worshipping those who by nature were not God, and his own people of
   Israel exceedingly prone to the same abomination, lest any should
   suppose that he had thoughts of including the essence of God in the
   house that he had built, he clears himself in this confession of his
   faith from all such imaginations, affirming that though indeed God
   would dwell on the earth, yet he was so far from being limited unto or
   circumscribed in the house that he had built, that "the heaven and the
   heaven of heavens," any space whatever that could be imagined, the
   highest heaven, could not, "cannot contain him;" so far is he from
   having a certain place in heaven where he should reside, in distinction
   from other places where he is not. "He is God in heaven above, and in
   earth beneath," Josh. ii. 11. That which the temple of God was built
   unto, that "the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain." Now,
   the temple was built to the being of God, to God as God: so Acts vii.
   47, "But Solomon built him an house;" him, -- that is, the Most High,
   -- "who dwelleth not," is not circumscribed, "in temples made with
   hands," verse 48.

   That of Ps. cxxxix. 7-10 is no less evident; the presence or face of
   God is expressly affirmed to be everywhere: "Whither shall I go from
   thy face? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I go into
   hell, behold, thou art there" As God is affirmed to be in heaven, so
   everywhere else; now that he is in heaven, in respect of his essence
   and being, is not questioned.

   Neither can that of the prophet Isaiah, chap. lxvi. 1, be otherwise
   understood but as an ascribing of an ubiquity to God, and a presence in
   heaven and earth: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool."
   The words are metaphorical, and in that way expressive of the presence
   of a person; and so God is present in heaven and earth. That the earth
   should be his footstool, and yet himself be so inconceivably distant
   from it as the heaven is from the earth (an expression chosen by
   himself to set out the greatest distance imaginable), is not readily to
   be apprehended. "He is not far from every one of us: for in him we
   live, and move, and have our being," Acts xvii. 27, 28.

   The testimony which God gives to this his perfection in Jer. xxiii. 23,
   24, is not to be avoided; more than what is here spoken by God himself
   as to his omnipresence we cannot, we desire not to speak: "Can any hide
   himself in secret places, that I shall not see him? saith the Lord. Do
   not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord." Still where mention is
   made of the presence of God, there heaven and earth (which two are
   comprehensive of, and usually put for the whole creation) are
   mentioned: and herein he is neither to be thought afar off nor near,
   being equally present everywhere, in the hidden places as in heaven;
   that is, he is not distant from any thing or place, though he take up
   no place, but is nigh all things, by the infiniteness and existence of
   his being.

   From what is also known of the nature of God, his attributes and
   perfections, the truth delivered may be farther argued and confirmed;
   as, --

   1. God is absolutely perfect; whatever is of perfection is to be
   ascribed to him: otherwise he could neither be absolutely
   self-sufficient, all-sufficient, nor eternally blessed in himself. He
   is absolutely perfect, inasmuch as no perfection is wanting to him, and
   comparatively above all that we can conceive or apprehend of
   perfection. If, then, ubiquity or omnipresence be a perfection, it no
   less necessarily belongs to God than it does to be perfectly good and
   blessed. That this is a perfection is evident from its contrary. To be
   limited, to be circumscribed, is an imperfection, and argues weakness
   We commonly say, we would do such a thing in such a place could we be
   present unto it, and are grieved and troubled that we cannot be so.
   That it should be so is an imperfection attending the limitedness of
   our natures. Unless we will ascribe the like to God, his omnipresence
   is to be acknowledged. If every perfection, then, be in God (and if
   every perfection be not in any, he is not God), this is not to be
   denied to him.

   2. Again; if God be now "in a certain place in heaven," I ask where he
   was before these heavens were made? These heavens have not always been.
   God was then where there was nothing but God, -- no heaven, no earth,
   no place. In what place was God when there was no place? When the
   heavens were made, did he cease this manner of being in himself,
   existing in his own infinite essence, and remove into the new place
   made for him? Or is not God's removal out of his existence in himself
   into a certain place a blasphemous imagination? "Ante omnia Deus erat
   solus ipse sibi, et locus, et mundus, et omnia," Tertul. Is this change
   of place and posture to be ascribed to God Moreover, if God be now only
   in a certain place of the heavens, if he should destroy the heavens and
   that place, where would he then be in what place? Should he cease to be
   in the place wherein he is, and begin to be in, to take up, and possess
   another? And are such apprehensions suited to the infinite perfections
   of God? Yea, may we not suppose that he may create another heaven? can
   he not do its. How should he be present there? or must it stand empty?
   or must he move himself thither? or make himself bigger than he was, to
   fill that heaven also?

   3. The omnipresence of God is grounded on the infiniteness of his
   essence. If God be infinite, he is omnipresent. Suppose him infinite,
   and then suppose there is any thing besides himself, and his presence
   with that thing, wherever it be, doth necessarily follow; for if he be
   so bounded as to be in his essence distant from any thing, he is not
   infinite. To say God is not infinite in his essence denies him to be
   infinite or unlimited in any of his perfections or properties; and
   therefore, indeed, upon the matter Socinus denies God's power to be
   infinite, because he will not grant his essence to be, Cat. chap. xi.
   part 1. That which is absolutely infinite cannot have its residence in
   that which is finite and limited, so that if the essence of God be not
   immense and infinite, his power, goodness, etc., are also bounded and
   limited; so that there are, or may be, many things which in their own
   natures are capable of existence, which yet God cannot do for want of
   power. How suitable to the Scriptures and common notions of mankind
   concerning the nature of God this is will be easily known. It is yet
   the common faith of Christians that God is aperigraptos kai apeiros.

   4. Let reason (which the author of these Catechisms pretends to advance
   and honour, as some think, above its due, and therefore cannot decline
   its dictates) judge of the consequences of this gross apprehension
   concerning the confinement of God to the heavens, yea, "a certain place
   in the heavens," though he "glister" never so much "in glory" there
   where he is. For, (1.) He must be extended as a body is, that so he may
   fill the place, and have parts as we have, if he be circumscribed in a
   certain place; which though our author thinks no absurdity, yet, as we
   shall afterward manifest, it is as bold an attempt to make an idol of
   the living God as ever any of the sons of men engaged into. (2.) Then
   God's greatness and ours, as to essence and substance, differ only
   gradually, but are still of the same kind. God is bigger than a man, it
   is true, but yet with the same kind of greatness, differing from us as
   one man differs from another. A man is in a certain place of the earth,
   which he fills and takes up; and God is in a certain place of the
   heavens, which he fills and takes up. Only some gradual difference
   there is, but how great or little that difference is, as yet we are not
   taught. (3.) I desire to know of Mr B. what the throne is made of that
   God sits on in the heavens, and how far the glistering of his glory
   doth extend, and whether that glistering of glory doth naturally attend
   his person as beams do the sun, or shining doth fire, or can he make it
   more or less as he pleaseth? (4.) Doth God fill the whole heavens, or
   only some part of them? If the whole, being of such substance as is
   imagined, what room will there be in heaven for any body else? Can a
   lesser place hold him 1 or could he fill a greater? If not, how came
   the heavens [to be] so fit for him? Or could he not have made them of
   other dimensions, less or greater? If he be only in a part of heaven,
   as is more than insinuated in the expression that he is "in a certain
   place in the heavens," I ask why he dwells in one part of the heavens
   rather than another? [157] or whether he ever removes or takes a
   journey, as Elijah speaks of Baal, 1 Kings xviii. 27, or is eternally,
   as limited in, so confined unto, the certain place wherein he is?
   Again; how doth he work out those effects of almighty power which are
   at so great a distance from him as the earth is from the heavens, which
   cannot be effected by the intervenience of any created power, as the
   resurrection of the dead, etc. The power of God doubtless follows his
   essence, and what this extends not to that cannot reach. But of that
   which might be spoken to vindicate the infinitely glorious being of God
   from the reproach which his own word is wrested to cast upon him, this
   that hath been spoken is somewhat that to my present thoughts doth
   occur.

   I suppose that Mr B. knows that in this his circumscription of God to a
   certain place, he transgresses against the common consent of mankind;
   if not, a few instances of several sorts may, I hope, suffice for his
   conviction. I shall promiscuously propose them, as they lie at hand or
   occur to my remembrance. For the Jews, Philo gives their judgment.
   "Hear," saith he, "of the wise God that which is most true, that God is
   in no place, for he is not contained, but containeth all. That which is
   made is in a place, for it must be contained and not contain." [158]
   And it is the observation of another of them, that so often as mqvm?, a
   place, is said of God, the exaltation of his immense and incomparable
   essence (as to its manifestation) is to be understood. [159] And the
   learned Buxtorf tells us that when that word is used of God, it is by
   an antiphrasis, to signify that he is infinite, illocal, received in no
   place, giving place to all. [160] That known saying of Empedocles
   passed among the heathen, "Deus est circulus, cujus centrum ubique,
   circumferentia nusquam;" and of Seneca, "Turn which way thou wilt, thou
   shalt see God meeting thee. Nothing is empty of him: he fills his own
   work." [161] "All things are full of God," says the poet; [162] and
   another of them:--


   "Estque Dei sedes nisi terræ, et pontus, et ær,

   Est coelum, et versus superos, quid quærimus ultra:

   Jupiter est quodcunque vides, quocunque moveris." [163]

   Of this presence of God, I say, with and unto all things, of the
   infinity of his essence, the very heathens themselves, by the light of
   nature (which Mr B. herein opposes), had a knowledge. Hence did some of
   them term him kosmopoios nous, "a mind framing the universe," and
   affirmed him to be infinite. "Primus omnium rerum desoriptionem et
   modum, mentis infinitæ vi et ratione designari, et confici voluit,"
   says Cicero of Anaxagoras, Tull. de Nat. Deor. lib. i. 11; -- "All
   things are disposed of by the virtue of one infinite mind." And
   Plutarch, expressing the same thing, says he is nous katharos kai
   arkratos emmemigmenos pasi, -- "a pure and sincere mind, mixing itself,
   and mixed" (so they expressed the presence of the infinite mind) "with
   all things." So Virgil, "Jovis omnia plena," -- "All things are full of
   God," (for God they intended by that name, Acts xvii. 25, 28, 29; and
   says Lactantius, "Convicti de uno Deo, cum id negare non possunt, ipsum
   se colere, afrmant, verum hoc sibi placere, ut Jupiter nominetur," lib.
   i. cap. 2.); which, as Servius on the place observes, he had taken from
   Aratus, whose words are:--


   Ek dios archomestha ton oude pot andres eomen

   Arrheton mestai de dios pasai men haguiai

   Pasai d anthropon agorai meste de thalassa

   Kai limenes pante de dios kechremetha pantes

   -- giving a full description, in his way, of the omnipresence and
   ubiquity of God. The same Virgil, from the Platonics, tells us in
   another place:--


   "Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus

   Mens agitat molem."

   Æn. vi. 726.

   And much more of this kind might easily be added. The learned know
   where to find more for their satisfaction; and for those that are
   otherwise, the clear texts of Scripture cited before may suffice.

   Of those, on the other hand, who have, no less grossly and carnally
   than he of whom we speak, imagined a diffusion of the substance of God
   through the whole creation, and a mixture of it with the creatures,
   [164] so as to animate and enliven them in their several forms, making
   God an essential part of each creature, [165] or dream of an assumption
   of creatures into an unity of essence with God, I am not now to speak.

Chapter III.

   Of the shape and bodily visible figure of God.

   Mr Biddle's question:--

   Is God in the Scripture said to have any likeness, similitude, person,
   shape?

   The proposition which he would have to be the conclusion of the answers
   to these questions is this, That, according to the doctrine of the
   Scriptures, God is a person shaped like a man; -- a conclusion so
   grossly absurd that it is refused as ridiculous by Tully, a heathen, in
   the person of Cotta (De Nat. Deor. lib. i. 6), against Velleius the
   Epicurean, the Epicureans only amongst the philosophers being so
   sottish as to admit that conceit. And Mr B., charging that upon the
   Scripture which hath been renounced by all the heathens who set
   themselves studiously to follow the light of nature, and, by a strict
   inquiry, to search out the nature and attributes of God, principally
   attending to that safe rule of ascribing nothing to him that eminently
   included imperfection, [166] hath manifested his pretext of mere
   Christianity to be little better than a cover for downright atheism, or
   at best of most vile and unworthy thoughts of the Divine Being. And
   here also doth Mr B. forsake his masters. [167] Some of them have had
   more reverence of the Deity, and express themselves accordingly, in
   express opposition to this gross figment.

   According to the method I proceeded in, in consideration of the
   precedent questions, shall I deal with this, and first consider briefly
   the scriptures produced to make good this monstrous, horrid assertion.
   The places urged and insisted on of old by the Anthropomorphites [168]
   were such as partly ascribed a shape in general to God, partly such as
   mention the parts and members of God in that shape, his eyes, his arms,
   his hands, etc.; from all which they looked on him as an old man
   sitting in heaven on a throne, -- a conception that Mr B. is no
   stranger to. The places of the first sort are here only insisted on by
   Mr B., and the attribution of a "likeness, image, similitude, person,
   and shape" unto God, is his warrant to conclude that he hath a visible,
   corporeal image and shape like that of a man; which is the plain
   intendment of his question. Now, if the image, likeness, or similitude,
   attributed to God as above, do no way, neither in the sum of the words
   themselves nor by the intendment of the places where they are used, in
   the least ascribe or intimate that there is any such corporeal, visible
   shape in God as he would insinuate, but are properly expressive of some
   other thing that properly belongs to him, I suppose it will not be
   questioned but that a little matter will prevail with a person desiring
   to emerge in the world by novelties, and on that account casting off
   that reverence of God which the first and most common notions of
   mankind would instruct him into, to make bold with God and the
   Scripture for his own ends and purposes.

   1. I say then, first, in general, if the Scripture may be allowed to
   expound itself, it gives us a fair and clear account of its own
   intendment in mentioning the image and shape of God, which man was
   created in, and owns it to be his righteousness and holiness; in a
   state whereof, agreeable to the condition of such a creature, man ing
   created is said to be created in the image and likeness of God, -- in a
   kind of resemblance unto that holiness and righteousness which are in
   him, Eph. iv. 23, 24, etc. What can hence be concluded for a corporeal
   image or shape to be ascribed unto God is too easily discernible. From
   a likeness in some virtue or property to conclude to a likeness in a
   bodily shape, may well befit a man that cares not what he says, so he
   may speak to the derogation of the glory of God.

   2. For the particular places by Mr B. insisted on, and the words used
   in them, which he lays the stress of this proposition upon: the first
   two words are dmvt? and tslm?; both of which are used in Gen. i. 26.
   The word dmvt? is used Gen. v. 1, and tslm?, Gen. ix. 6; but neither of
   these words doth, in its genuine signification, imply any corporeity or
   figure. The most learned of all the rabbins, and most critically
   skillful in their language, hath observed and proved that the proper
   Hebrew word for that kind of outward form or similitude is t'r?; and if
   these be ever so used, it is in a metaphorical and borrowed sense, or
   at]east there is an amphiboly in the words, the Scripture sometimes
   using them in such subjects where this gross, corporeal sense cannot
   possibly be admitted: kdmvt chmtnchs?, -- "Like the poison of a
   serpent," Ps. lviii. 4. There is, indeed, some imaginable, or rather
   rational, resemblance in the properties there mentioned, but no
   corporeal similitude. Vide Ezek. i. 28, xxiii. 14 (to which may be
   added many more places), where if dmvt? shall be interpreted of a
   bodily similitude, it will afford no tolerable sense. The same likewise
   may be said oftslm?. It is used in the Hebrew for the essential form
   rather than the figure or shape; and being spoken of men, signifies
   rather their souls than bodies. So it is used, Ps. lxxiii. 20; which is
   better translated, "Thou shalt despise their soul," than their "image."
   So where it is said, Ps. xxxix. 6, "Every man walketh in a vain show"
   (the same word again), however it ought to be interpreted, it cannot be
   understood of a corporeal similitude. So that these testimonies are not
   at all to his purpose. What, indeed, is the image of God, or that
   likeness to him wherein man was made, I have partly mentioned already,
   and shall farther manifest, chap. vi.; and if this be not a bodily
   shape, it will be confessed that nothing can here be concluded for the
   attribution of a shape to God; and hereof an account will be given in
   its proper place.

   The sum of Mr B.'s reasoning from these places is: "God, in the
   creation of the lower world and the inhabitancy thereof, making man,
   enduing him with a mind and soul capable of knowing him, serving him,
   yielding him voluntary and rational obedience; creating him in a
   condition of holiness and righteousness, in a resemblance to those
   blessed perfections in himself, requiring still of him to be holy as he
   is holy, to continue and abide in that likeness of his; giving him in
   that estate dominion over the rest of his works here below, -- is said
   to create him in his own image and likeness, he being the sovereign
   lord over all his creatures, infinitely wise, knowing, just, and holy:
   therefore he hath a bodily shape and image, and is therein like unto a
   man." "Quod erat demonstrandum."

   His next quotation is from Num. xii. 7, 8, where it is said of Moses
   that he shall behold the "similitude of the Lord." The word is tmvnh?;
   which, as it is sometimes taken for a corporeal similitude, so it is at
   other times for that idea whereby things are intellectually
   represented. In the former sense is it frequently denied of God; as
   Deut. iv. 15, "Ye saw no manner of similitude," etc. But it is
   frequently taken, in the other sense, for that object, or rather
   impression, whereby our intellectual apprehension is made; as in Job
   iv. 16, "An image was before mine eyes," namely, in his dream; which is
   not any corporeal shape, but that idea or objective representation
   whereby the mind of man understands its object, -- that which is in the
   schools commonly called phantasm, or else an intellectual species,
   about the notion of which it is here improper to contend. It is
   manifest that, in the place here alleged, it is put to signify the
   clear manifestation of God's presence to Moses, with some such glorious
   appearance thereof as he was pleased to represent unto him; therefore,
   doubtless, God hath a bodily shape.

   His next quotation is taken from James iii. 9, "Made after the
   similitude of God," -- Tous kath homoiosin Theou gegonotas. Certainly
   Mr B. cannot be so ignorant as to think the word homoiosis to include
   in its signification a corporeal similitude. The word is of as large an
   extent as "similitude" in Latin, and takes in as well those abstracted
   analogies which the understanding of man finds out, in comparing
   several objects together, as those other outward conformities of figure
   and shape which are the objects of our carnal eyes. It is the word by
   which the LXX. use to render the word dmvt?; of which we have spoken
   before. And the examples are innumerable in the Septuagint translation,
   and in authors of all sorts written in the Greek language, where that
   word is taken at large, and cannot signify a corporeal similitude; so
   that it is vain to insist upon particulars. And this also belongs to
   the same head of inquiry with the former, -- namely, what likeness of
   God it was that man was created in, whether of eyes, ears, nose, etc.,
   or of holiness, etc.

   His next allegation is from Job xiii. 7, 8, "Will ye accept his
   person?"hphnyv?, prosopon autou, -- an allegation so frivolous that to
   stand to answer it studiously would be ridiculous, 1. It is an
   interrogation, and doth not assert any thing. 2. The thing spoken
   against is prosopolepsia, which hath in it no regard to shape or
   corporeal personality, but to the partiality which is used in
   preferring one before another in justice. 3. The word mentioned, with
   its derivatives, is used in as great or greater variety of metaphorical
   translations than any other Hebrew word, and is by no means determined
   to be a signification of that bulky substance which, with the soul,
   concurs to make up the person of mare It is so used, Gen. xxxiii. 18,
   'tphny?, -- "Jacob pitched his tent before" (or "in the face of") "the
   city." It is confessed that it is very frequently translated prosopon
   by the LXX., as it is very variously translated by them; sometimes ho
   ophthalmos. See Jer. xxxviii. 26; Neh. ii. 13; Job xvi. 16; Deut. ii.
   36; Prov. xxvii. 23. Besides that, it is used in many other places for
   anti enanti apenanti epano enopion, and in many more senses. So that to
   draw an argument concerning the nature of God from a word so
   amphibological, or of such frequent translation in metaphorical speech,
   is very unreasonable.

   Of what may be hence deduced this is the sum: "In every plea or contest
   about the ways, dispensations, and judgments of God, that which is
   right, exact, and according to the thing itself, is to be spoken, his
   glory not standing in the least need of our flattery or lying;
   therefore God is such a person as hath a bodily shape and similitude,
   for there is no other person but what hath so."

   His last argument is from John v. 37, "Ye have neither heard his voice
   at any time, nor seen his shape," -- Oute eidos autou heorakate. But it
   argues a very great ignorance in all philosophical and accurate
   writings, to appropriate eidos to a corporeal shape, it being very
   seldom used, either in Scripture or elsewhere, in that notion; -- the
   Scripture having used it where that sense cannot be fastened on it, as
   in 1 Thess. v. 22, Apo pantos eidous ponerou apechesthe which may be
   rendered, "Abstain from every kind," or "every appearance," but not
   from every shape "of evil;" and all other Greek authors, who have
   spoken accurately and not figuratively of things, use it perpetually
   almost in one of these two senses, and very seldom if at all in the
   other.

   How improperly, and with what little reason, these places are
   interpreted of a corporeal similitude or shape, hath been showed.
   Wherein the image of God consists the apostle shows, as was declared,
   determining it to be in the intellectual part, not in the bodily, [169]
   Col. iii. 10, Endusamenoi ton neon (anrthopon) ton anakainoumenon eis
   epignosin kat eikona tou ktisantos auton. The word here used, eikon, is
   of a grosser signification than eidos, which hath its original from the
   intellectual operation of the mind; yet this the apostle determines to
   relate to the mind and spiritual excellencies, so that it cannot, from
   the places he hath mentioned, with the least colour of reason, be
   concluded that God hath a corporeal similitude, likeness, person, or
   shape. [170]

   What hath already been delivered concerning the nature of God, and is
   yet necessarily to be added, will not permit that much be peculiarly
   spoken to this head, for the removal of those imperfections from him
   which necessarily attend that assignation of a bodily shape to him
   which is here aimed at. That the Ancient of Days is not really one in
   the shape of an old man, sitting in heaven on a throne, glistering with
   a corporeal glory, his hair being white and his raiment beautiful, is
   sufficiently evinced from every property and perfection which in the
   Scripture is assigned to him.

   The Holy Ghost, speaking in the Scripture concerning God, doth not
   without indignation suppose any thing to be likened or compared to him.
   Maimonides hath observed that these words, Aph, Ira, etc., are never
   attributed to God but in the case of idolatry; that never any idolater
   was so silly as to think that an idol of wood, stone, or metal, was a
   god that made the heavens and earth; but that through them all
   idolaters intend to worship God. Now, to fancy a corporeity in God, or
   that he is like a creature, is greater and more irrational dishonour to
   him than idolatry. "To whom will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye
   compare unto him?" Isa. xl. 18. "Have ye not known? have ye not heard?
   hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood
   from the foundations of the earth? It is he that sitteth," etc. "To
   whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One,"
   verses 21-23, 25. Because the Scripture speaks of the eyes and ears,
   nostrils and arms of the Lord, and of man being made afar his likeness,
   if any one shall conclude that he sees, hears, smells, and hath the
   shape of a man, he must, upon the same reason, conclude that he hath
   the shape of a lion, of an eagle, and is like a drunken man, because in
   Scripture he is compared to them, and so of necessity make a monster of
   him, and worship a chimera. [171]

   Nay, the Scripture plainly interprets itself as to these attribution
   unto God. His arm is not an arm of flesh, 2 Chron. xxxii. 8. Neither
   are his eyes of flesh, neither seeth he as man seeth, Job x. 4. Nay,
   the highest we can pretend to (which is our way of understanding),
   though it hath some resemblance of him, yet falls it infinitely short
   of a likeness or equality with him. And the Holy Ghost himself gives a
   plain interpretation of his own intendment in such expressions: for
   whereas, Luke xi. 20, our Saviour says that he "with the finger of God
   cast out devils;" Matt. xii. 28, he affirms that he did it "by the
   Spirit of God," intending the same thing. It neither is nor can
   righteously be required that we should produce any place of Scripture
   expressly affirming that God hath no shape, nor hands, nor eyes, as we
   have, no more than it is that he is no lion or eagle. It is enough that
   there is that delivered of him abundantly which is altogether
   inconsistent with any such shape as by Mr B. is fancied, and that so
   eminent a difference as that now mentioned is put between his arms and
   eyes and ours, as manifests them to agree in some analogy of the thing
   signified by them, and not in an answerableness in the same kind.
   Wherefore I say, that the Scripture speaking of God, though it
   condescends to the nature and capacities of men, and speaks for the
   most part to the imagination (farther than which few among the sons of
   men were ever able to raise their cogitations), yet hath it clearly
   delivered to us such attributes of God as will not consist with that
   gross notion which this man would put upon the Godhead. The infinity
   and immutability of God do manifestly overthrow the conceit of a shape
   and form of God. [172] Were it not a contradiction that a body should
   be actually infinite, yet such a body could not have a shape, such a
   one as he imagines. The shape of any thing is the figuration of it; the
   figuration is the determination of its extension towards several parts,
   consisting in a determined proportion of them to each other; that
   determination is a bounding and limiting of them: so that if it have a
   shape, that will be limited which was supposed to be infinite, which is
   a manifest contradiction. But the Scripture doth plainly show that God
   is infinite and immense, not in magnitude (that were a contradiction,
   as will appear anon) but in essence. Speaking to our fancy, it saith
   that "he is higher than heaven, deeper than hell," Job xi. 8; that "he
   fills heaven and earth," Jer. xxiii. 24; that "the heaven of heavens
   cannot contain him," 1 Kings viii. 27; and it hath many [such]
   expressions to shadow out the immensity of God, as was manifest in our
   consideration of the last query. But not content to have yielded thus
   to our infirmity, it delivers likewise, in plain and literal terms, the
   infiniteness of God: "His understanding is infinite," Ps. cxlvii. 5;
   and therefore his essence is necessarily so. This is a consequence that
   none can deny who will consider it till he understands the terms of it,
   as hath Been declared. Yet, lest any should hastily apprehend that the
   essence of God were not therefore necessarily infinite, the Holy Ghost
   saith, Ps. cxlv. 3, that "his greatness hath no end," or is
   "inconceivable," which is infinite; for seeing we can carry on our
   thoughts, by calculation, potentially in infinitum, -- that is,
   whatever measure be assigned, we can continually multiply it by greater
   and greater numbers, as they say, in infinitum, -- it is evident that
   there is no greatness, either of magnitude or essence, which is
   unsearchable or inconceivable besides that which is actually infinite.
   Such, therefore, is the greatness of God, in the strict and literal
   meaning of the Scripture; and therefore, that he should have a shape
   implies a contradiction. But of this so much Before as I presume we may
   now take it for granted.

   Now, this attribute of infinity doth immediately and demonstratively
   overthrow that gross conception of a human shape we are in the
   consideration of; and so it doth, by consequence, overthrow the conceit
   of any other, though a spherical shape. Again, --

   Whatever is incorporeal is destitute of shape; whatever is infinite is
   incorporeal: therefore, whatever is infinite is destitute of shape.

   All the question is of the minor proposition. Let us therefore suppose
   an infinite body or line, and let it be bisected; either then, each
   half is equal to the whole, or less. If equal, the whole is equal to
   the part; if less, then that half is limited within certain bounds, and
   consequently is finite, and so is the other half also: therefore, two
   things which are finite shall make up an infinite; which is a
   contradiction.

   Having, therefore, proved out of Scripture that God is infinite, it
   follows also that he is incorporeal, and that he is without shape.

   The former argument proved him to be without such a shape as this
   catechist would insinuate; this, that he is without any shape at all.
   The same will be proved from the immutability or impassibility of God's
   essence, which the Scripture assigns to him: Mal. iii. 6, "I am the
   Lord; I change not" "The heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall
   perish, but thou endurest: they shall Be changed: but thou art the
   same," Ps. cii. 25, 26.

   If he be immutable, then he is also incorporeal, and consequently
   without shape.

   The former consequence is manifest, for every body is extended, and
   consequently is capable of division, which is mutation; wherefore,
   Being immutable, he hath no shape.

   Mr B.'s great plea for the considering of his Catechism, and insisting
   upon the same way of inquiry with himself, is from the success which
   himself hath found in the discovery of sundry truths, of which he gives
   an account in his book to the reader. That, among the glorious
   discoveries made by him, the particular now insisted on is not to be
   reckoned, I presume Mr B. knoweth. For this discovery the world is
   beholding to one Audæus, a monk, of whom you have a large account in
   Epiphanius, tom. i. lib. 3, Hær. 70; as also in Theodoret, lib. iv.
   Eccles. Hist., cap. x., who also gives us an account of the man and his
   conversation, with those that followed him. Austin also acquaints us
   with this worthy predecessor of our author, De Hær. cap. l. He that
   thinks it worth while to know that we are not beholding to Mr B., but
   to this Audæus, for all the arguments, whether taken from the creation
   of man in the image of God or the attribution of the parts and members
   of a man unto God in the Scripture, to prove him to have a visible
   shape, may at his leisure consult the authors above mentioned, who will
   not suffer him to ascribe the praise of this discovery to Mr B.'s
   ingenious inquiries. How the same figment was also entertained by a
   company of stupid monks in Egypt, who, in pursuit of their opinion,
   came in a great drove to Alexandria, to knock Theophilus the bishop on
   the head, who had spoken against them, and how that crafty companion
   deluded them with an ambiguity of expression, with what learned stirs
   ensued thereon, we have a full relation in Socrat. Eccles. Hist. lib.
   vi. cap. vii. [173]

   As this madness of brain-sick men was always rejected by all persons of
   sobriety professing the religion of Jesus Christ, so was it never
   embraced by the Jews, or the wiser sort of heathens, who retained any
   impression of those common notions of God which remain in the hearts of
   men. [174] The Jews to this day do solemnly confess, in their public
   worship, that God is not corporeal, that he hath no corporeal
   propriety, and therefore can nothing be compared with him. So one of
   the most learned of them of old: Oute gar anthropomorphos ho Theos oute
   theoeides anthropinon soma, Phil. de Opificio Mundi; -- "Neither hath
   God a human form, nor does a human body resemble him." And in Sacrifi.
   Abel: Oude ta hosa anthropois epi Theou kuriologeitai katachresis de
   onomaton esti paregorousa ten hemeteran astheneian -- "Neither are
   those things which are in us spoken properly of God, but there is an
   abuse of names therein, relieving our weakness."

   Likewise the heathens, who termed God noun, and psuchosin and pneuma,
   and dunamopoion or dunamin, had the same apprehensions of him. Thus
   discourses Mercurius ad Tatium, in Stobæus, serm. 78: Theon men noesai
   chalepon phrasai de adunaton; to gar asomaton somati semenai adunaton
   kai to teleion to atelei katalabesthai ou dunaton kai to aidion to

   Serm. 83: To de hen estin ariston autos hoper esti kattan ennoian zoon
   ouranion aphtharton archa te kai aitia tas ton holon diakosmasios

   Of the like import is that distich of Xenophanes in Clemens Alexan.,
   Strom. 5:--


   Eis Theos en te theoisi kai anthropoisi megistos

   Thute demas thnetoisin homoiios oude noema.


   "There is one great God among gods and men,

   Who is like to mortals neither as to body nor mind."

   Whereunto answers that in Cato:--


   "Si Deus est animus nobis ut carmina dicunt," etc.

   And Æschylus, in the same place of Clemens, Strom. 5:--


   Choreite thneton ton Theon kai me dokei

   Homoion auto sarkikon kathestanai.

   "Separate God from mortals, and think not thyself, of flesh, like him."

   And Posidonius plainly in Stobæus as above: Ho Theos esti pneuma noeron
   kai purodes ouk echon morphen -- "God is an intelligent fiery spirit,
   not having any shape." And the same apprehension is evident in that of
   Seneca, "Quid est Deus? Mens universi. Quid est Deus? Quod vides totum,
   et quod non vides totum. Sic demure magnitude sua illi redditur, qua
   nihil majus excogitari potest, si solus est omnia, opus suum et extra
   et intra tenet. Quid ergo interest inter naturam Dei et nostram? Nostri
   melior pars animus est, in illo nulla pars extra animum." Natural.
   Quæst. lib. 1. Præfat. It would be burdensome, if not endless, to
   insist on the testimonies that to this purpose might be produced out of
   Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Epictetus, Julius Firmicus, and others of the
   same order. I shall close with one of Alcinous, de Doctrina Platon.
   cap. x.: Atopon de ton Theon hex hules einai kai eidous ou gar estai
   haplous oude archikos -- "It is absurd to say that God is of matter and
   form; for if so, he could neither be simple, nor the principal cause."

   The thing is so clear, and the contrary, even by the heathen
   philosophers, accounted so absurd, that I shall not stand to pursue the
   arguments flowing from the other attributes of God, but proceed to what
   follows.

Chapter IV.

   Of the attribution of passions and affections, anger, fear, repentance,
   unto God -- In what sense it is done in the Scripture.

   His next inquiry about the nature of God respects the attribution of
   several affections and passions unto him in the Scriptures, of whose
   sense and meaning he thus expresseth his apprehension:--

   Ques. Are there not, according to the perpetual tenor of the
   Scriptures, affections and passions in God, as anger, fury, zeal,
   wrath, love, hatred, mercy, grace, jealousy, repentance, grief, joy,
   fear?

   Concerning which he labours to make the Scriptures determine in the
   affirmative.

   1. The main of Mr Biddle's design, in his questions about the nature of
   God, being to deprive the Deity of its distinct persons, its
   omnipresence, prescience, and therein all other infinite perfections,
   he endeavours to make him some recompense for all that loss by
   ascribing to him in the foregoing query a human visible shape, and in
   this, human, turbulent affections and passions. Commonly, where men
   will not ascribe to the Lord that which is his due, he gives them up to
   assign that unto him which he doth abhor, Jer. xliv. 15-17. Neither is
   it easily determinable whether be the greater abomination. By the
   first, the dependence of men upon the true God is taken off; by the
   latter, their hope is fixed on a false. This, on both sides, at present
   is Mr B.'s sad employment. The Lord lay it not to his charge, but
   deliver him from the snare of Satan, wherein he is "taken alive at his
   pleasure"! 2 Tim. ii. 26.

   2. The things here assigned to God are ill associated, if to be
   understood after the same manner. Mercy and grace we acknowledge to be
   attributes of God; the rest mentioned are by none of Mr B.'s companions
   esteemed any other than acts of his will, and those metaphorically
   assigned to him. [175]

   3. To the whole I ask, whether these things are in the Scriptures
   ascribed properly unto God, denoting such affections and passions in
   him as those in us are which are so termed? or whether they are
   assigned to him and spoken of him metaphorically only, in reference to
   his outward works and dispensations, correspondent and answering to the
   actings of men in whom such affections are, and under the power whereof
   they are in those actings? If the latter be affirmed, then as such an
   attribution of them unto God is eminently consistent with all his
   infinite perfections and blessedness, so there can be no difference
   about this question and the answers given thereunto, all men readily
   acknowledging that in this sense the Scripture doth ascribe all the
   affections mentioned unto God, of which we say as he of old, Tauta
   anthropopathos men legontai theoprepos de noountai. But this, I fear,
   will not serve Mr B.'s turn. The very phrase and manner of expression
   used in this question, the plain intimation that is in the forehead
   thereof of its author's going off from the common received
   interpretation of these attributions unto God, do abundantly manifest
   that it is their proper significancy which he contends to fasten on
   God, and that the affections mentioned are really and properly in him
   as they are in us. This being evident to be his mind and intendment, as
   we think his anthropopathism in this query not to come short in folly
   and madness of his anthropomorphitism in that foregoing, so I shall
   proceed to the removal of this insinuation in the way and method
   formerly insisted on.

   Mr B.'s masters tell us "That these affections are vehement commotions
   of the will of God, whereby he is carried out earnestly to the object
   of his desires, or earnestly declines and abhors what falls not out
   gratefully or acceptably to him." [176] I shall first speak of them in
   general, and then to the particulars (some or all) mentioned by Mr
   B.:--

   First, In general, that God is perfect and perfectly blessed, I suppose
   will not be denied; it cannot be but by denying that he is God. [177]
   He that is not perfect in himself and perfectly blessed is not God. To
   that which is perfect in any kind nothing is wanting in that kind. To
   that which is absolutely perfect nothing is wanting at all. He who is
   blessed is perfectly satisfied and filled, and hath no farther desire
   for supply. He who is blessed in himself is all-sufficient for himself.
   If God want or desire any thing for himself, he is neither perfect nor
   blessed. To ascribe, then, affections to God properly (such as before
   mentioned), is to deprive him of his perfection and blessedness. The
   consideration of the nature of these and the like affections will make
   this evident.

   1. Affections, considered in themselves, have always an incomplete,
   imperfect act of the will or volition joined with them. They are
   something that lies between the firm purpose of the soul and the
   execution of that purpose. [178] The proper actings of affections lie
   between these two; that is, in an incomplete, tumultuary volition. That
   God is not obnoxious to such volitions and incomplete actings of the
   will, besides the general consideration of his perfections and
   blessedness premised, is evident from that manner of procedure which is
   ascribed to him. His purposes and his works comprise all his actings.
   As the Lord hath purposed, so hath he done. "He worketh all things
   after the counsel of his own will." "Who hath known his mind? or who
   hath been his counsellor? Of him, and through him, and to him, are all
   things." [179]

   2. They have their dependence on that wherewith he in whom they are is
   affected; that is, they owe their rise and continuance to something
   without him in whom they are. A man's fear ariseth from that or them of
   whom he is afraid; by them it is occasioned, on them it depends
   Whatever affects any man (that is, the stirring of a suitable
   affection), in all that frame of mind and soul, in all the volitions
   and commotions of will which so arise from thence, he depends on
   something without him. Yea, our being affected with something without
   lies at the bottom of most of our purposes and resolves Is it thus with
   God, with him who is I am? Exod. iii. 14. Is he in dependence upon any
   thing without him? Is it not a most eminent contradiction to speak of
   God in dependence on any other thing? Must not that thing either be God
   or be reduced to some other without and besides him, who is God, as the
   causes of all our affections are? "God is in one mind, and who can turn
   him? what his soul desireth, that he doeth," Job xxiii. 13.

   3. Affections are necessarily accompanied with change and mutability;
   yea, he who is affected properly is really changed; yea, there is no
   more unworthy change or alteration than that which is accompanied with
   passion, [180] as is the change that is wrought by the affections
   ascribed to God. A sedate, quiet, considerate alteration is far less
   inglorious and unworthy than that which is done in and with passion.
   Hitherto we have taken God upon his testimony, that he is the "Lord,
   and he changeth not," Mal. iii. 6; that "with him there is neither
   change nor shadow of turning;" -- it seems, like the worms of the
   earth, he varieth every day.

   4. Many of the affections here ascribed to God do eminently denote
   impotence; which, indeed, on this account, both by Socinians and
   Arminians, is directly ascribed to the Almighty. They make him
   affectionately and with commotion of will to desire many things in
   their own nature not impossible, which yet he cannot accomplish or
   bring about (of which I have elsewhere spoken); yea, it will appear
   that the most of the affections ascribed to God by Mr B., taken in a
   proper sense, are such as are actually ineffectual, or commotions
   through disappointments, upon the account of impotency or defect of
   power.

   Corol. To ascribe affections properly to God is to make him weak,
   imperfect, dependent, changeable, and impotent.

   Secondly, Let a short view be taken of the particulars, some or all of
   them, that Mr B. chooseth to instance in. "Anger, fury, wrath, zeal"
   (the same in kind, only differing in degree and circumstances), are the
   first he instances in; and the places produced to make good this
   attribution to God are, Num. xxv. 3, 4; Ezek. v. 13; Exod. xxxii. 11,
   12; Rom. i. 18.

   1. That mention is made of the auger, wrath, and fury of God in the
   Scripture is not questioned. Num. xxv. 4, Deut. xiii. 17, Josh. vii.
   26, Ps. lxxviii. 31, Isa. xiii. 9, Deut. xxix. 24, Judges ii. 14, Ps.
   lxxiv. 1, lxix. 24, Isa. xxx. 30, Lam. ii. 6, Ezek. v. 15, Ps. lxxviii.
   49, Isa. xxxiv. 2, 2 Chron. xxviii. 11, Ezra x. 14, Hab. iii. 8, 12,
   are farther testimonies thereof. The words also in the original, in all
   the places mentioned, express or intimate perturbation of mind,
   commotion of spirit, corporeal mutation of the parts of the body, and
   the like distempers of men acting under the power of that passion. The
   whole difference is about the intendment of the Holy Ghost in these
   attributions, and whether they are properly spoken of God, asserting
   this passion to be in him in the proper significancy of the words, or
   whether these things be not taken anthropopathos, and to be understood
   theoprepos, in such a sense as may answer the meaning of the figurative
   expression, assigning them their truth to the utmost, and yet to be
   interpreted in a suitableness to divine perfection and blessedness.

   2. The anger, then, which in the Scripture is assigned to God, we say
   denotes two things:--

   (1.) His vindictive justice, or constant and immutable will of
   rendering vengeance for sin. [181] So God's purpose of the
   demonstration of his justice is called his being "willing to show his
   wrath" or anger, Rom. ix. 22; so God's anger and his judgments are
   placed together, Ps. vii. 6; and in that anger he judgeth, verse 8, And
   in this sense is the "wrath of God" said to be "revealed from heaven,"
   Rom. i. 18; that is, the vindictive justice of God against sin to be
   manifested in the effects of it, or the judgments sent and punishments
   inflicted on and throughout the world.

   (2.) By anger, wrath, zeal, fury, the effects of anger are denoted:
   Rom. iii. 5, "Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?" The words are,
   ho epipheron ten orgen, -- "who inflicteth or bringeth anger on man;"
   that is, sore punishments, such as proceed from anger; that God's
   vindictive justice. And Eph. v. 6, "For these things cometh the wrath
   of God upon the children of disobedience." Is it the passion or
   affection of auger in God that Mr B. talks of, that comes upon the
   children of disobedience? or is it indeed the effect of his justice for
   this sin? [182] Thus the day of judgment is called the "day of wrath"
   and of "anger," because it is the day of the "revelation of the
   righteous judgment of God:" Rom. ii. 5, "After thy hardness," etc. In
   the place of Ezekiel (chap. v. 13) mentioned by Mr B., the Lord tells
   them he will," cause his fury to rest upon them," and "accomplish it
   upon them. I ask whether he intends this of any passion in him (and if
   so, how a passion in God can rest upon a man), or the judgments which
   for their iniquities he did inflict? We say, then, anger is not
   properly ascribed to God, but metaphorically, denoting partly his
   vindictive justice, whence all punishments flow, partly the effects of
   it in the punishments themselves, either threatened or inflicted, in
   their terror and bitterness, upon the account of what is analogous
   therein to our proceeding under the power of that passion; and so is to
   be taken in all the places mentioned by Mr B. For, --

   3. Properly, in the sense by him pointed to, anger, wrath, etc., are
   not in God. Anger is defined by the philosopher to be, orexis meta
   lupes timorias phainomenes dia phainomenen oligorian, -- "desire joined
   with grief of that which appears to be revenge, for an appearing
   neglect or contempt." To this grief, he tells you, there is a kind of
   pleasure annexed, arising from the vehement fancy which an angry person
   hath of the revenge he apprehends as future, [183] -- which, saith he,
   "is like the fancy of them that dream," [184] -- and he ascribes this
   passion mostly to weak, impotent persona Ascribe this to God, and you
   leave him nothing else. There is not one property of his nature
   wherewith it is consistent. If he be properly and literally angry, and
   furious, and wrathful, he is moved, troubled, perplexed, desires
   revenge, and is neither blessed nor perfect. But of these things in our
   general reasons against the propriety of these attributions afterward.

   4. Mr B. hath given us a rule in his preface, that when any thing is
   ascribed to God in one place which is denied of him in another, then it
   is not properly ascribed to him. Now, God says expressly that "fury" or
   anger "is not in him," Isa. xxvii. 4; and therefore it is not properly
   ascribed to him.

   5. Of all the places where mention is made of God's repentings, or his
   repentance, there is the same reason. Exod. xxxii. 14, Gen. vi. 6, 7,
   Judges x. 16, Deut. xxx. 9, are produced by Mr B. That one place of 1
   Sam. xv. 29, where God affirms that he "knoweth no repentance," casts
   all the rest under a necessity of an interpretation suitable unto it.
   Of all the affections or passions which we are obnoxious to, there is
   none that more eminently proclaims imperfection, weakness, and want in
   sundry kinds, than this of repentance. If not sins, mistakes, and
   miscarriages (as for the most part they are), yet disappointment,
   grief, and trouble, are always included in it. So is it in that
   expression, Gen. vi. 6, "It repented the Lord that he had made man on
   the earth, and it grieved him at his heart." [185] What but his mistake
   and great disappointment, by a failing of wisdom, foresight, and power,
   can give propriety to these attributions unto God? The change God was
   going then to work in his providence on the earth was such or like that
   which men do when they repent of a thing, being "grieved at the heart"
   for what they had formerly done. So are these things spoken of God to
   denote the kind of the things which he doth, not the nature of God
   himself; otherwise such expressions as these would suit him, whose
   frame of spirit and heart is so described: "Had I seen what would have
   been the issue of making man, I would never have done it. Would I had
   never been so overseen as to have engaged in such a business! What have
   I now got by my rashness? nothing but sorrow and grief of heart
   redounds to me." And do these become the infinitely blessed God.

   6. Fear is added, from Deut. xxxii. 26, 27. "Fear," saith the wise man,
   "is a betraying of those succours which reason offereth;" [186] --
   nature's avoidance of an impendent evil; its contrivance to flee and
   prevent what it abhors, being in a probability of coming upon it; a
   turbulent weakness. This God forbids in us, upon the account of his
   being our God, Isa. xxxv. 4; "Fear not, O worm Jacob," etc., chap. xli.
   14. Everywhere he asserts fear to be unfit for them who depend on him
   and his help, who is able in a moment to dissipate, scatter, and reduce
   to nothing, all the causes of their fear. And if there ought to be no
   fear where such succour is ready at hand, sure there is none in Him who
   gives it. Doubtless, it were much better to exclude the providence of
   God out of the world than to assert him afraid properly and directly of
   future events. The schools say truly, "Quod res sunt futuræ, a
   voluntate Dei est (effectiva vel permissiva)." How, then, can God be
   afraid of what he knows will, and purposeth shall, come to pass? He
   doth, he will do, things in some likeness to what we do for the
   prevention of what we are afraid of. He will not scatter his people,
   that their adversaries may not have advantage to trample over them.
   When we so act as to prevent any thing that, unless we did so act,
   would befall us, it is because we are afraid of the coming of that
   thing upon us: hence is the reason of that attribution unto God. That
   properly He should be afraid of what comes to pass who knows from
   eternity what will so do, who can with the breath of his mouth destroy
   all the objects of his dislike, who is infinitely wise, blessed,
   all-sufficient, and the sovereign disposer of the lives, breath, and
   ways of all the sons of men, is fit for Mr B. and no man else to
   affirm. "All the nations are before him as the drop of the bucket, and
   the dust of the balance, as vanity, as nothing; he upholdeth them by
   the word of his power; in him all men live, and move, and have their
   being," and can neither live, nor act, nor be without him; their life,
   and breath, and all their ways, are in his hands; he brings them to
   destruction, and says, "Return, ye children of men;" [187] and must he
   needs be properly afraid of what they will do to him and against him.

   7. Of God's jealousy and hatred, mentioned from Ps. v. 4, 5, Exod. xx.
   5, Deut. xxxii. 21, there is the same reason. Such effects as these
   things in us produce shall they meet withal who provoke him by their
   blasphemies and abominations. Of love, mercy, and grace, the condition
   is something otherwise: principally they denote God's essential
   goodness and kindness, which is eminent amongst his infinite
   perfections; and secondarily the effects thereof, in and through Jesus
   Christ, are denoted by these expressions. To manifest that neither they
   nor any thing else, as they properly intend any affections or passions
   of the mind, any commotions of will, are properly attributed to God,
   unto what hath been spoken already these ensuing considerations may be
   subjoined:--

   (1.) Where no cause of stirring up affections or passions can have
   place or be admitted, there no affections are to be admitted; for to
   what end should we suppose that whereof there can be no use to
   eternity? If it be impossible any affection in God should be stirred up
   or acted, is it not impossible any such should be in him? The causes
   stirring up all affections are the access of some good desired, whence
   joy, hope, desire, etc., have their spring; or the approach of some
   evil to be avoided, which occasions fear, sorrow, anger, repentance,
   and the like. Now, if no good can be added to God, whence should joy
   and desire be stirred up in him? if no evil can befall him, in himself
   or any of his concernments, whence should he have fear, sorrow, or
   repentance? Our goodness extends not to him; he hath no need of us or
   our sacrifices, Ps. xvi. 2, l. 8-10; Job xxxv. 6-8. "Can a man be
   profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself?
   Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it
   gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?" chap. xxii. 2, 3.

   (2.) The apostle tells us that God is "blessed for ever," Rom. ix. 5;
   "He is the blessed and only Potentate," 1 Tim. vi. 15; "God
   all-sufficient," Gen. xvii. 1. That which is inconsistent with absolute
   blessedness and all-sufficiency is not to be ascribed to God; to do so
   casts him down from his excellency. But can he be blessed, is he
   all-sufficient, who is tossed up and down with hope, joy, fear, sorrow,
   repentance, anger, and the like? Doth not fear take off from absolute
   blessedness? Grant that God's fear doth not long abide yet whilst it
   doth so, he is less blessed than he was before and than he is after his
   fear ceaseth. When he hopes, is he not short in happiness of that
   condition which he attains in the enjoyment of what he hoped for? and
   is he not lower when he is disappointed and falls short of his
   expectation? Did ever the heathens speak with more contempt of what
   they worshipped? Formerly the pride of some men heightened them to
   fancy themselves to be like God, without passions or affections, Ps. l.
   21; being not able to abide in their attempt against their own sense
   and experience, it is now endeavoured to make God like to us, in having
   such passions and affections. My aim is brevity, having many heads to
   speak unto. Those who have written on the attributes of God, -- his
   self-sufficiency and blessedness, simplicity, immutability, etc., --
   are ready to tender farther satisfaction to them who shall desire it.

Chapter V.

   Of God's prescience or foreknowledge.

   His next attempt is to overthrow and remove the prescience or
   foreknowledge of God, with what success the farther consideration of
   the way whereby he endeavours it will manifest. His question (the
   engine whereby he works) is thus framed:--

   As for our free actions which are neither past nor present, but may
   afterward either be or not be, what are the chief passages of Scripture
   from whence it is wont to be gathered that God knoweth not such actions
   until they come to pass, yea, that there are such actions?

   That we might have had a clearer acquaintance with the intendment of
   this interrogation, it is desirable Mr Biddle had given us his sense on
   some particulars, which at first view present themselves to the trouble
   of every ordinary reader; as, --

   1. How we may reconcile the words of Scripture given in answer to his
   preceding query with the design of this. There it is asserted that God
   "understandeth our thoughts" (which certainly are of our free actions,
   if any such there are) "afar off;" here, that he knows not our free
   actions that are future, and not yet wrought or performed.

   2. By whom is it "wont to be gathered" from the following scriptures
   that "God knoweth not our free actions until they come to pass." Why
   doth not this "mere Christian," that is of no sect, name his companions
   and associates in these learned collections from Scripture? Would not
   his so doing discover him to be so far from a mere Christian, engaged
   in none of the sects that are now amongst Christians, as to be of that
   sect which the residue of men so called will scarce allow the name of a
   Christian unto? [188]

   3. What he intends by the close of his query, "Yea, that there are such
   actions." An advance is evident in the words towards a farther negation
   of the knowledge of God than what was before expressed. Before, he
   says, God knows not our actions that are future contingent; here, he
   knows not that there are such actions. The sense of this must be,
   either that God knows not that there are any such actions as may or may
   not be, -- which would render him less knowing than Mr B., who hath
   already told us that such there be, -- or else that he knows not such
   actions when they are, at least without farther inquiring after them,
   and knowledge obtained beyond what from his own infinite perfections
   and eternal purpose he is furnished withal. In Mr B.'s next book or
   catechism, I desire he would answer these questions also.

   Now in this endeavour of his Mr B. doth but follow his leaders. Socinus
   in his Prelections, where the main of his design is to vindicate man's
   free-will into that latitude and absoluteness as none before him had
   once aimed at, in his eighth chapter objects to himself this
   foreknowledge of God as that which seems to abridge and cut short the
   liberty contended for. [189] He answers that he grants not the
   foreknowledge pretended, and proceeds in that and the two following
   chapters, labouring to answer all the testimonies and arguments which
   are insisted on for the proof and demonstration of it, giving his own
   arguments against it, chap. xi. Crellius is something more candid, as
   he pretends, but indeed infected with the same venom with the other;
   for after he hath disputed for sundry pages to prove the foreknowledge
   of God, he concludes at last that for those things that are future
   contingent, he knows only that they are so, and that possibly they may
   come to pass, possibly they may not. [190] Of the rest of their
   associates few have spoken expressly to this thing. Smalcius once and
   again manifests himself to consent with his masters in his disputations
   against Franzius, expressly consenting to what Socinus had written in
   his Prelections, and affirming the same thing himself, yea, disputing
   eagerly for the same opinion with him. [191]

   For the vindication of God's foreknowledge, I shall proceed in the same
   order as before in reference to the other attributes of God insisted
   on, namely:-- 1. What Mr B. hath done, how he hath disposed of sundry
   places of Scripture for the proof of his assertion, with the sense of
   the places by him so produced, is to be considered; 2. Another question
   and answer are to be supplied in the room of his; 3. The truth
   vindicated to be farther confirmed.

   For the first:--

   In the proof of the assertion proposed Mr B. finds himself entangled
   more than ordinarily, though I confess his task in general be such as
   no man not made desperate by the loss of all in a shipwreck of faith
   would once have undertaken. To have made good his proceeding according
   to his engagement, he ought at least to have given us texts of
   Scripture express in the letter, as by him cut off from the state,
   condition, and coherence, wherein by the Holy Ghost they are placed,
   for the countenancing of his assertion: but here, being not able to
   make any work in his method, proposed and boasted in as signal and
   uncontrollable, no apex or tittle in the Scripture being pointed
   towards the denial of God's knowing any thing or all things, past,
   present, and to come, he moulds his question into a peculiar fashion,
   and asks, whence or from what place of Scripture may such a thing as he
   there avers be gathered; at once plainly declining the trial he had put
   himself upon of insisting upon express texts of Scripture only, not one
   of the many quoted by him speaking one word expressly to the business
   in hand, and laying himself naked to all consequences rightly deduced
   from the Scripture, and expositions given to the letter of some places
   suitable to "the proportion of faith," Rom. xii. 6. That, then, which
   he would have, he tells you is gathered from the places of Scripture
   subjoined, but how, by whom, by what consequence, with what evidence of
   reason, it is so gathered, he tells you not. An understanding, indeed,
   informed with such gross conceptions of the nature of the Deity as Mr
   B. hath laboured to insinuate into the minds of men, might gather, from
   his collection of places of Scripture for his purpose in hand, that God
   is afraid, troubled, grieved, that he repenteth, altereth and changeth
   his mind to and fro; but of his knowledge or foreknowledge of things,
   whether he have any such thing or not, there is not the least
   intimation, unless it be in this, that if he had any such
   foreknowledge, he need not put himself to so much trouble and vexation,
   nor so change and alter his mind, as he doth. And with such figments as
   these (through the infinite, wise, and good providence of God,
   punishing the wantonness of the minds and lives of men, by giving them
   up to strong delusions and vain imaginations, in the darkness of their
   foolish hearts, 2 Thess. ii. 10-12, so far as to change the glory of
   the incorruptible God into the likeness of a corruptible, weak,
   ignorant, sinful man, Rom. i. 23), are we now to deal.

   But let the places themselves be considered. To these heads they may be
   referred:-- 1. Such as ascribe unto God fear and being afraid. Deut.
   xxxii. 26, 27; Exod. xiii. 17; Gen. iii. 22, 23, are of this sort. 2.
   Repentance, 1 Sam. xv. 10, 11, ult. 3. Change, or alteration of mind,
   Num. xiv. 27, 30; 1 Sam. ii. 30. 4. Expectation whether a thing will
   answer his desire or no, Isa. v. 4. Conjecturing, Jer. xxxvi. 1-3;
   Ezek. xii. 1-3. 5. Trying of experiments, Judges iii. 1, 4; Dan. xii.
   10; 2 Chron. xxxii. 31. From all which and the like it may, by Mr B.'s
   direction and help, be thus gathered: "If God be afraid of what is to
   come to pass, and repenteth him of what he hath done when he finds it
   not to answer his expectation; if he sits divining and conjecturing at
   events, being often deceived therein, and therefore tries and makes
   experiments that he may be informed of the true state of things: then
   certainly he knows not the free actions of men, that are not yet come
   to pass." The antecedent Mr B. hath proved undeniably from ten texts of
   Scripture, and doubtless the consequent is easily to be gathered by any
   of his disciples. Doubtless it is high time that the old, musty
   catechisms of prejudicate persons, who scarce so much as once consulted
   with the Scriptures in their composures, as being more engaged into
   factions, were removed out of the way and burned, that this "mere
   Christian" may have liberty to bless the growing generation with such
   notions of God as the idolatrous Pagans of old would have scorned to
   have received.

   But do not the Scriptures ascribe all the particulars mentioned unto
   God? Can you blame Mr B. without reflection on them? If only what the
   Scripture affirms in the letter, and not the sense wherein and the
   manner how it affirms it (which considerations are allowed to all the
   writings and speakings of the sons of men) is to be considered, the end
   seeming to be aimed at in such undertakings as this of Mr B., namely,
   to induce the atheistical spirits of the sons of men to a contempt and
   scorn of them and their authority, will probably be sooner attained
   than by the efficacy of any one engine raised against them in the world
   besides.

   As to the matter under consideration, I have some few things in general
   to propose to Mr B., and then I shall descend to the particulars
   insisted on:--

   First, then, I desire to know whether the things mentioned, as fear,
   grief, repentance, trouble, conjecturings, making trials of men for his
   own information, are ascribed properly to God as they are unto men, or
   tropically and figuratively, with a condescension to us, to express the
   things spoken of, and not to describe the nature of God. [192] If the
   first be said, namely, that these things are ascribed properly to God,
   and really signify of him the things in us intended in them, then to
   what hath been spoken in the consideration taken of the foregoing
   query, I shall freely add, for mine own part, I will not own nor
   worship him for my God who is truly and properly afraid of what all the
   men in the world either will or can do; who doth, can do, or hath done
   any thing, or suffered any thing to be done, of which he doth or can
   truly and properly repent himself, with sorrow and grief for his
   mistake; or that sits in heaven divining and conjecturing at what men
   will do here below: and do know that he whom I serve in my spirit will
   famish and starve all such gods out of the world. But of this before.
   If these things are ascribed to God figuratively and improperly,
   discovering the kind of his works and dispensations, not his own nature
   or property, I would fain know what inference can be made or conclusion
   drawn from such expressions, directly calling for a figurative
   interpretation? For instance, if God be said to repent that he had done
   such a thing, because such and such things are come to pass thereupon,
   if this repentance in God be not properly ascribed to him (as by Mr
   B.'s own rule it is not), but denotes only an alteration and change in
   the works that outwardly are of him, in an orderly subserviency to the
   immutable purpose of his will, what can thence be gathered to prove
   that God foreseeth not the free actions of men? And this is the issue
   of Mr B.'s confirmation of the thesis couched in his query insisted on
   from the Scriptures.

   2. I must crave leave once more to mind him of the rule he hath given
   us in his preface, namely, "That where a thing is improperly ascribed
   to God, in some other place it is denied of him," as he instances in
   that of his being weary; so that whatever is denied of him in any one
   place is not properly ascribed to him in any other. Now, though God be
   said, in some of the places by him produced, to repent, yet it is in
   another expressly said that he doth not so, and that upon such a
   general ground and reason as is equally exclusive of all those other
   passions and affections, upon whose assignment unto God the whole
   strength of Mr B.'s plea against the prescience of God doth depend: 1
   Sam. xv. 29, "Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for
   he is not a man, that he should repent." The immutability of his
   nature, and unlikeness to men in obnoxiousness to alterations, are
   asserted as the reason of his not repenting; which will equally extend
   its force and efficacy to the removal from him of all the other human
   affections mentioned. And this second general consideration of the
   foundation of Mr B.'s plea is sufficient for the removal of the whole.

   3. I desire to know whether indeed it is only the free actions of men
   that are not yet done that Mr B. denies to be known of God, or whether
   he excludes him not also from the knowledge of the present state,
   frame, and actings of the hearts of men, and how they stand affected
   towards him, being therein like other rulers among men, who may judge
   of the good and evil actions of men so far as they are manifest and
   evident, but how men in their hearts stand affected to them, their
   rule, government, and authority, they know not? To make this inquiry, I
   have not only the observation premised from the words of the close of
   Mr B.'s query being of a negative importance ("Yea, that there are such
   actions"), but also from some of the proofs by him produced of his
   former assertion being interpreted according to the literal
   significancy of the words, as exclusive of any figure, which he
   insisteth on. Of this sort is that of Gen. xxii. 1, 2, 10-12, where God
   is said to tempt Abraham, [193] and upon the issue of that trial says
   to him (which words Mr B., by putting them in a different character,
   points to as comprehensive of what he intends to gather and conclude
   from them), "Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not
   withheld thy son, thine only son, from me." The conclusion which Mr B.
   guides unto from hence is, that God knew not that which he inquired
   after, and therefore tempted Abraham that he might so do, and upon the
   issue of that trial says, "Now I know." But what was it that God
   affirms that now he knew? Not any thing future, not any free action
   that was not as yet done, but something of the present condition and
   frame of his heart towards God, -- namely, his fear of God; not whether
   he would fear him, but whether he did fear him then. If this, then, be
   properly spoken of God, and really as to the nature of the thing
   itself, then is he ignorant no less of things present than of those
   that are for to come. He knows not who fears him nor who hates him,
   unless he have opportunity to try them in some such way as he did
   Abraham. And then what a God hath this man delineated to us! How like
   the dunghill deities of the heathen, who speak after this rate! [194]
   Doubtless the description that Elijah gave of Baal would better suit
   him than any of those divine perfections which the living, all-seeing
   God hath described himself by. But now, if Mr B. will confess that God
   knows all the things that are present, and that this inquiry after the
   present frame of the heart and spirit of a man is improperly ascribed
   to him, from the analogy of his proceedings, in his dealing with him,
   to that which we insist upon when we would really find out what we do
   not know, then I would only ask of him why those other expressions
   which he mentions, looking to what is to come, being of the same nature
   and kind with this, do not admit of, yea call for, the same kind of
   exposition and interpretation.

   Neither is this the only place insisted on by Mr B. where the inquiry
   ascribed unto God, and the trial that he makes, is not in reference to
   things to come, but punctually to what is present: Deut. viii. 2, xiii.
   3, "The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord
   your God with all your heart and With all your soul;" 2 Chron. xxxii.
   31, "God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his
   heart;" and Phil. iv. 6, "In every thing let your requests be made
   known unto God." Let Mr B. tell us now plainly whether he supposes all
   these things to be spoken properly of God, and that indeed God knows
   not our hearts, the frame of them, nor what in them we desire and aim
   at, without some eminent trial and inquiry, or until we ourselves do
   make known what is in them unto him. If this be the man's mind (as it
   must be, if he be at any agreement with himself in his principles
   concerning these scriptural attributions unto God), for my part I shall
   be so far from esteeming him eminent as a mere Christian, that I shall
   scarcely judge him comparable, as to his apprehensions of God, unto
   many that lived and died mere Pagans. To this sense also is applied
   that property of God, that he "trieth the hearts," as it is urged by Mr
   B. from 1 Thess. ii. 4; -- that is, he maketh inquiry after what is in
   them; which, but upon search and trial, he knoweth not! By what ways
   and means God accomplisheth this search, and whether hereupon he comes
   to a perfect understanding of our hearts or no, is not expressed. John
   tells us that "God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things;"
   and we have thought on that account (with that of such farther
   discoveries as he hath made of himself and his perfections unto us)
   that he had been said to search our hearts; not that himself, for his
   own information, needs any such formal process by way of trial and
   inquiry, but because really and indeed he doth that in himself which
   men aim at in the accomplishment of their most diligent searches and
   exactest trials.

   And we may, by the way, see a little of this man's consistency with
   himself. Christ he denies to be God, -- a great part of his religion
   consists in that negative, -- yet of Christ it is said that "he knew
   all men, and needed not that any should testify of man, for he knew
   what was in man," John ii. 24, 25: and this is spoken in reference to
   that very thing in the hearts of men which he would persuade us that
   God knows not without inquiry; that is, upon the account of his not
   committing himself to those as true believers whom yet, upon the
   account of the profession they made, the Scripture calls so, and says
   they "believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did,"
   verse 23. Though they had such a veil of profession upon them that the
   Holy Ghost would have us esteem them as believers, yet Christ could
   look through it into their hearts, and discover and know their frame,
   and whether in sincerity they loved him and believed in his name or no;
   but this God cannot do without inquiry I And yet Christ (if we believe
   Mr B.) was but a mere man, as he is a "mere Christian." Farther; it
   seems, by this gentleman, that unless "we make known our requests to
   God," he knows not what we will ask. Yet we ask nothing but what is in
   our thoughts; and in the last query he instructs us that God knows our
   thoughts, -- and doubtless he knows Mr B.'s to be but folly. Farther
   yet; if God must be concluded ignorant of our desires, because we are
   bid to make our requests known unto him, he may be as well concluded
   forgetful of what himself hath spoken, because he bids us put him in
   remembrance, and appoints some to be his remembrancers. But to
   return:--

   This is the aspect of almost one-half of the places produced by Mr B.
   towards the business in hand. If they are properly spoken of God, in
   the same sense as they are of man, they conclude him not to know things
   present, the frame of the heart of any man in the world towards himself
   and his fear, nay, the outward, open, notorious actions of men. So it
   is in that place of Gen. xviii. 21, insisted on by Crellius, one of Mr
   B.'s great masters, "I will go down now, and see" (or know) "whether
   they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come
   unto me." [195] Yea, the places which, in their letter and outward
   appearance, seem to ascribe that ignorance of things present unto God
   are far more express and numerous than those that in the least look
   forward to what is yet for to come, or was so at their delivery. This
   progress, then, have we made under our catechist, if we may believe
   him, as he insinuates his notions concerning God: "God sits in heaven
   (glistering on a throne), whereunto he is limited, yea, to a certain
   place therein, so as not to be elsewhere; being grieved, troubled, and
   perplexed at the affairs done below which he doth know, making inquiry
   after what he doth not know, and many things (things future) he knoweth
   not at all."

   Before I proceed to the farther consideration of that which is
   eminently and expressly denied by Mr B., namely, "God's foreknowledge
   of our free actions that are future," because many of his proofs, in
   the sense by him urged, seem to exclude him from an acquaintance with
   many things present, -- as, in particular, the frame and condition of
   the hearts of men towards himself, as was observed, -- it may not be
   amiss a little to confirm that perfection of the knowledge of God as to
   those things from the Scripture; which will abundantly also manifest
   that the expressions insisted on by our catechist are metaphorical and
   improperly ascribed to God. Of the eminent predictions in the
   Scripture, which relate unto things future, I shall speak afterward. He
   knew, for he foretold the flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,
   the famine in Egypt, the selling and exaltation of Joseph, the reign of
   David, the division of his kingdom, the Babylonish captivity, the
   kingdom of Cyrus, the return of his people, the state and ruin of the
   four great empires of the world, the wars, plagues, famines,
   earthquakes, divisions, which he manifestly foretold. But farther, he
   knows the frame of the hearts of men; he knew that the Keilites would
   deliver up David to Saul if he stayed amongst them, -- which probably
   they knew not themselves, 1 Sam. xxiii. 12; he knew that Hazael would
   murder women and infants, which he knew not himself, 2 Kings viii. 12,
   13; he knew that the Egyptians would afflict his people, though at
   first they entertained them with honour, Gen. xv. 13; he knew Abraham,
   that he would instruct his household, chap. xviii. 19; he knew that
   some were obstinate, their neck an iron sinew, and their brow brass,
   Isa. xlviii. 4; he knew the imagination or figment of the heart of his
   people, Deut. xxxi. 21; that the church of Laodicea, notwithstanding
   her profession, was lukewarm, neither cold nor hot, Rev. iii. 15. "Man
   looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart,"
   1 Sam. xvi. 7. "He only knoweth the hearts of all the children of men,"
   1 Kings viii. 39. "Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much
   more then the hearts of the children of men?" Prov. xv. 11. So also
   Prov. xxiv. 12; Jer. xvii. 9, 10; Ezek. xi. 5; Ps. xxxviii. 9, xciv.
   11; Job xxxi. 4; Matt. vi. 4, 6, 8; Luke xvi. 15; Acts i. 24, etc.
   Innumerable other places to this purpose may be insisted on, though it
   is a surprisal to be put to prove that God knows the hearts of the sons
   of men. But to proceed to that which is more directly under
   consideration:--

   The sole foundation of Mr B.'s insinuation, that God knows not our free
   actions that are future, being laid, as was observed, on the
   assignation of fear, repentance, expectation, and conjecturing, unto
   God, the consideration which hath already been had of those
   attributions in the Scripture and the causes of them is abundantly
   sufficient to remove it out of the way, and to let his inference sink
   thither whence it came. Doubtless never was painter so injurious to the
   Deity (who limned out the shape of an old man on a cloth or board, and,
   after some disputes with himself whether he should sell it for an
   emblem of winter, set it out as a representation of God the Father) as
   this man is in snatching God's own pencil out of his hand, and by it
   presenting him to the world in a gross, carnal, deformed shape. Plato
   would not suffer Homer in his Commonwealth, for intrenching upon the
   imaginary blessedness of their dunghill deities, making Jupiter to
   grieve for the death of Sarpedon, [196] Mars to be wounded by Diomedes,
   and to roar thereupon with disputes and conjectures in heaven among
   themselves about the issue of the Trojan war, [197] though he
   endeavours to salve all his heavenly solecisms by many noble
   expressions concerning purposes not unmeet for a deity, telling us, in
   the close and issue of a most contingent after, Dios de teleieto bole.
   [198] Let that man think of how much sorer punishment he shall be
   thought worthy (I speak of the great account he is one day to make) who
   shall persist in wresting the Scripture to his own destruction, to
   represent the living and incomprehensible God unto the world trembling
   with fear, pale with anger, sordid with grief and repentance, perplexed
   with conjectures and various expectations of events, and making a
   diligent inquiry after the things he knows not; that is, altogether
   such an one as himself: let all who have the least reverence of and
   acquaintance with that Majesty with whom we have to do judge and
   determine. But of these things before.

   The proposure of a question to succeed in the room of that removed,
   with a scriptural resolution thereof, in order to a discovery of what
   God himself hath revealed concerning his knowledge of all things, is
   the next part of our employment. Thus, then, it may be framed:--

   Ques. Doth not God know all things, whether past, present, or to come,
   all the ways and actions of men, even before their accomplishment, or
   is any thing hid from him? What says the Scripture properly and
   directly hereunto?

   Ans. "God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things," 1 John
   iii. 20. "Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
   sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with
   whom we have to do," Heb. iv. 13. "The Lord is a God of knowledge," 1
   Sam. ii. 3. "Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine up-rising, thou
   understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying
   down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in
   my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether," Ps. cxxxix.
   2-4. "Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
   infinite," Ps. cxlvii. 5. "Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or
   being his counsellor hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and
   who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught
   him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?" Isa. xl.
   13, 14. "There is no searching of his understanding," verse 28. Rom.
   xi. 36, "Of him are all things;" and, "Known unto God are all his works
   from the beginning of the world," Acts xv. 18, etc.

   Of the undeniable evidence and conviction of God's prescience or
   foreknowledge of future contingents, from his prediction of their
   coming to pass, with other demonstrations of the truth under
   consideration, attended with their several testimonies from Scripture,
   the close of this discourse will give a farther account.

   It remains only that, according to the way and method formerly insisted
   on, I give some farther account of the perfection of God pleaded for,
   with the arguments wherewith it is farther evidenced to us, and so to
   proceed to what followeth:--

   1. That knowledge is proper to God, the testimony of the Scripture unto
   the excellency and perfection of the thing itself doth sufficiently
   evince. [199] "I cannot tell," says the apostle: "God knoweth," 2 Cor.
   xii. 2, 3. It is the general voice of nature, upon relation of any
   thing that to us is hid and unknown, that the apostle there makes
   mention of: "God knoweth." That he knoweth the things that are past, Mr
   B. doth not question. That at least also some things that are present,
   yea some thoughts of our hearts, are known to him, he doth not deny. It
   is not my intendment to engage in any curious scholastical discourse
   about the understanding, science, knowledge, or wisdom of God, nor of
   the way of God's knowing things in and by his own essence, through
   simple intuition. That which directly is opposed is his knowledge of
   our free actions, which, in respect of their second and mediate causes,
   may or may not be. This, therefore, I shall briefly explain, and
   confirm the truth of it by Scripture testimonies and arguments from
   right reason, not to be evaded without making head against all God's
   infinite perfections, having already demonstrated that all that which
   is insisted on by Mr B. to oppose it is spoken metaphorically and
   improperly of God.

   That God doth foresee all future things was amongst mere Pagans so
   acknowledged as to be looked on as a common notion of mankind. [200] So
   Xenophon tells us, "That both Grecians and barbarians consented in
   this, that the gods knew all things, present and to come." [201] And it
   may be worth our observation, that whereas Crellius, one of the most
   learned of this gentleman's masters, distinguisheth between esomena and
   mellonta, affirming that God knows ta esomena, which, though future,
   are necessarily so, yet he knows not ta mellonta, which are only, says
   he, likely so to be. [202] Xenophon plainly affirms that all nations
   consent that he knows ta mellonta. "And this knowledge of his," saith
   that great philosopher, "is the foundation of the prayers and
   supplications of men for the obtaining of good or the avoiding of
   evil." Now, that one calling himself a "mere Christian" should oppose a
   perfection of God that a mere Pagan affirms all the world to
   acknowledge to be in him would seem somewhat strange, but that we know
   all things do not answer or make good the names whereby they are
   called.

   For the clearer handling of the matter under consideration, the terms
   wherein it is proposed are a little to be explained:--

   1. That prescience or foreknowledge is attributed to God, the Scripture
   testifieth. Acts ii. 23, Rom. viii. 29, xi. 2, 1 Pet. i. 2, are proofs
   hereof. The term, indeed (foreknowing), rather relates to the things
   known, and the order wherein they stand one to another and among
   themselves, than is properly expressive of God's knowledge. God knows
   all things as they are, and in that order wherein they stand. Things
   that are past, as to the order of the creatures which he hath appointed
   to them, and the works of providence which outwardly are of him, he
   knows as past; not by remembrance, as we do, but by the same act of
   knowledge wherewith he knew them from all eternity, even before they
   were. [203] Their existence in time and being, cast by the successive
   motion of things into the number of the things that are past, denotes
   an alteration in them, but not at all in the knowledge of God. So it is
   also in respect of things future. God knows them in that esse
   intelligibile which they have, as they may be known and understood; and
   how that is shall afterward be declared. He sees and knows them as they
   are, when they have that respect upon them of being future; when they
   lose this respect, by their actual existence, he knows them still as
   before. They are altered; his knowledge, his understanding is infinite,
   and changeth not.

   2. God's knowledge of things is either of simple intelligence (as
   usually it is phrased) or of vision. [204] The first is his knowledge
   of all possible things; that is, of all that he himself can do. That
   God knows himself I suppose will not be denied. An infinite
   understanding knows throughly all infinite perfections. God, then,
   knows his own power or omnipotency, and thereby knows all that he can
   do. Infinite science must know, as I said, what infinite power can
   extend unto. Now, whatever God can do is possible to be done; that is,
   whatever hath not in itself a repugnancy to being. Now, that many
   things may be done by the power of God that yet are not, nor ever shall
   be done, I suppose is not denied. Might he not make a new world? Hence
   ariseth the attribution of the knowledge of simple intelligence before
   mentioned unto God. In his own infinite understanding he sees and knows
   all things that are possible to be done by his power, would his good
   pleasure concur to their production.

   Of the world of things possible which God can do, some things, even all
   that he pleaseth, are future. [205] The creation itself, and all things
   that have had a being since, were so future before their creation. Had
   they not some time been future, they had never been. Whatever is, was
   to be before it wan All things that shall be to the end of the world
   are now future. How things which were only possible, in relation to the
   power of God, come to be future, and in what respect, shall be briefly
   mentioned. These things God knoweth also. His science of them is called
   of vision. He sees them as things which, in their proper order, shall
   exist. In a word, "scientia visionis," and "simplicis intelligentise,"
   may be considered in a threefold relation; that is, "in ordine ad
   objectum, mensuram, modum:" -- (1.) "Scientia visionis" hath for its
   object things past, present, and to come, -- whatsoever had, hath, or
   will have, actual being. The measure of this knowledge is his will;
   because the will and decree of God only make those things future which
   were but possible before: therefore we say, "Scientia visionis fundatur
   in voluntate." For the manner of it, it is called "Scientia libera,
   quia fundatur in voluntate," as necessarily presupposing a free act of
   the divine will, which makes things future, and so objects of this kind
   of knowledge. (2.) As for that "scientia" which we call "simplicis
   intelligentiæ," the object of it is possible; the measure of it
   omnipotency, for by it he knows all he can do; and for the manner of
   it, it is "scientia necessaria, quia non fundatur in voluntate, sed
   potestate" (say the schoolmen), seeing by it he knows not what he will,
   but what he can do. Of that late figment of a middle science in God,
   arising neither from the infinite perfection of his own being, as that
   of simple intelligence, nor yet attending his free purpose and decree,
   as that of vision, but from a consideration of the second causes that
   are to produce the things foreknown, in their kind, order, and
   dependence, I am not now to treat. And with the former kind of
   knowledge it is, or rather in the former way (the knowledge of God
   being simply one and the same) is it, that we affirm him to know the
   things that are future, of what sort soever, or all things before they
   come to pass.

   3. The things inquired after are commonly called contingent.
   Contingencies are of two sorts:-- (1.) Such as are only so; (2.) Such
   as are also free.

   (1.) Such as are only so are contingent only in their effects: such is
   the falling of a stone from a house, and the killing of a man thereby.
   The effect itself was contingent, nothing more; the cause necessary,
   the stone, being loosed from what detained it upon the house, by its
   own weight necessarily falling to the ground. (2.) That which is so
   contingent as to be also free, is contingent both in respect of the
   effect and of its causes also. Such was the soldier's piercing of the
   side of Christ. The effect was contingent, -- such a thing might have
   been done or not; and the cause also, for they chose to do it who did
   it, and in respect of their own elective faculty might not have chosen
   it. That a man shall write, or ride, or speak to another person
   to-morrow, the agent being free, is contingent both as to the cause and
   to the effect. About these is our principal inquiry; and to the
   knowledge of God which he is said to have of them is the opposition
   most expressly made by Mr B. Let this, then, be our conclusion:--

   God perfectly knows all the free actions of men before they are wrought
   by them. [206] All things that will be done or shall be to all
   eternity, though in their own natures contingent and wrought by agents
   free in their working, are known to him from eternity.

   Some previous observations will make way for the clear proof and
   demonstration of this truth. Then, --

   1. God certainly knows everything that is to be known; that is,
   everything that is scibile. If there be in the nature of things an
   impossibility to be known, they cannot be known by the divine
   understanding. If any thing be scibile, or may be known, the not
   knowing of it is his imperfection who knows it not. To God this cannot
   be ascribed (namely, that he should not know what is to be known)
   without the destruction of his perfection. He shall not be my God who
   is not infinitely perfect. He who wants any thing to make him blessed
   in himself can never make the fruition of himself the blessedness of
   others.

   2. Every thing that hath a determinate cause is scibile, may be known,
   though future, by him that perfectly knows that cause which doth so
   determine the thing to be known unto existence. Now, contingent things,
   the free actions of men that yet are not, but in respect of themselves
   may or may not be, have such a determinate cause of their existence as
   that mentioned. It is true, in respect of their immediate causes, as
   the wills of men, they are contingent, and may be or not be; but that
   they have such a cause as before spoken of is evident from the light of
   this consideration: in their own time and order they are. Now, whatever
   is at any time was future; before it was, it was to be. If it had not
   been future, it had not now been. Its present performance is sufficient
   demonstration of the futurition it had Before. I ask, then, whence it
   came to be future, -- that that action was rather to be than a thousand
   others that were as possible as it? for instance, that the side of
   Christ should be pierced with a spear, when it was as possible, in the
   nature of the thing itself and of all secondary causes, that his head
   should be cut off. That, then, which gives any action a futurition is
   that determinate cause wherein it may be known, whereof we speak. Thus
   it may be said of the same thing that it is contingent and determined,
   without the least appearance of contradiction, because it is not spoken
   with respect to the same things or causes.

   3. The determinate cause of continent things, that is, things that are
   future (for every thing when it is, and as it is, is necessary), [207]
   is the will of God himself concerning their existence and being; either
   by his efficiency and working, as all good things in every kind (that
   is, that are either morally or physically so, in which latter sense all
   the actions of men, as actions, are so); or by his permission, which is
   the condition of things morally evil, or of the irregularity and
   obliquity attending those actions, upon the account of their relation
   to a law, which in themselves are entitative and physically good, as
   the things were which God at first created. [208] Whether any thing
   come to pass beside the will of God and contrary to his purpose will
   not be disputed with any advantage of glory to God or honour to them
   that shall assert it. [209] That in all events the will of God is
   fulfilled is a common notion of all rational creatures. So the
   accomplishment of his "determinate counsel" is affirmed by the apostle
   in the issue of that mysterious dispensation of the crucifying of his
   Son. That of James iv. 15, Ean ho Kurios thelese, intimates God's will
   to be extended to all actions, as actions, whatever. Thus God knew
   before the world was made, or any thing that is in it, that there would
   be such a world and such things in it; yet than the making of the world
   nothing was more free or contingent. [210] God is not a necessary agent
   as to any of the works that outwardly are of him. Whence, then, did God
   know this? Was it not from his own decree and eternal purpose that such
   a world there should be? And if the knowledge of one contingent thing
   be from hence, why not of all? In brief, these future contingencies
   depend on something for their existence, or they come forth into the
   world in their own strength and upon their own account, not depending
   on any other. If the latter, they are God; if the former, the will of
   God or old Fortune must be the principle on which they do depend.

   4. God can work with contingent causes for the accomplishment of his
   own will and purposes, without the least prejudice to them, either as
   causes or as free and contingent. God moves not, works not, in or with
   any second causes, to the producing of any effect contrary or not
   agreeable to their own natures. Notwithstanding any predetermination or
   operation of God, the wills of men, in the production of every one of
   their actions, are at as perfect liberty as a cause in dependence of
   another is capable of. To say it is not in dependence is atheism. The
   purpose of God, the counsel of his will, concerning any thing as to its
   existence, gives a necessity of infallibility to the event, but changes
   not the manner of the second cause's operation, be [it] what it will.
   [211] That God cannot accomplish and bring about his own purposes by
   free and contingent agents, without the destruction of the natures he
   hath endued them withal, is a figment unworthy the thoughts of any who
   indeed acknowledge his sovereignty and power.

   5. The reason why Mr B.'s companions in his undertaking, as others that
   went before him of the same mind, do deny this foreknowledge of God,
   they express on all occasions to be that the granting of it is
   prejudicial to that absolutely independent liberty of will which God
   assigns to men: so Socinus pleads, Prælect. Theol. cap. viii.; thus
   far, I confess, more accurately than the Arminians. [212] These pretend
   (some of them, at least) to grant the prescience of God, but yet deny
   his determinate decrees and purposes, on the same pretence that the
   others do his prescience, namely, of their prejudicialness to the
   free-will of man. Socinus discourses (which was no difficult task) that
   the foreknowledge of God is as inconsistent with that independent
   liberty of will and contingency which he and they had fancied as the
   predetermination of his will; and therefore rejects the former as well
   as the latter. It was Augustine's complaint of old concerning Cicero,
   that "ita fecit homines liberos, ut fecit etiam sacrilegos." [213]
   Cicero was a mere Pagan, and surely our complaint against any that
   shall close with him in this attempt, under the name of a "mere
   Christian," will not be less just than that of Augustine. For mine own
   part, I am fully resolved that all the liberty and freedom that, as
   creatures, we are capable of is eminently consistent with God's
   absolute decrees and infallible foreknowledge; and if I should hesitate
   in the apprehension thereof, I had rather ten thousand times deny our
   wills to be free than God to be omniscient, the sovereign disposer of
   all men, their actions, and concernments, or say that any thing comes
   to pass without, against, or contrary to the counsel of his will. But
   we know, through the goodness of God, that these things have their
   consistency, and that God may have preserved to him the glory of his
   infinite perfection, and the will of man not at all be abridged of its
   due and proper liberty.

   These things being premised, the proof and demonstration of the truth
   proposed lies ready at hand in the ensuing particulars:--

   1. He who knows all things knows the things that are future, though
   contingent. [214] In saying they are things future and contingent, you
   grant them to be among the number of things, as you do those which you
   call things past; but that God knows all things hath already been
   abundantly confirmed out of Scripture. Let the reader look back on some
   of the many texts and places by which I gave answer to the query about
   the foreknowledge of God, and he will find abundantly enough for his
   satisfaction, if he be of those that would be satisfied, and dares not
   carelessly make bold to trample upon the perfections of God. Take some
   few of them to a review: 1 John iii. 20, "God is greater than our
   heart, and knoweth all things." Even we know things past and present.
   If God knows only things of the same kind, his knowledge may be greater
   than ours by many degrees, but you cannot say his understanding is
   infinite; there is not, on that supposition, an infinite distance
   between his knowledge and ours, but they stand in some measurable
   proportion. Heb. iv. 13, "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes
   of him with whom we have to do." "Not that which is to come, not the
   free actions of men that are future," saith Mr B. But to distinguish
   thus when the Scripture doth not distinguish, and that to the great
   dishonour of God, is not to interpret the word, but to deny it, Acts
   xv. 8, "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
   world." I ask, whether God hath any thing to do in the free actions of
   men? For instance, had he any thing to do in the sending of Joseph into
   Egypt, his exaltation there, and the entertainment of his father's
   household afterward by him in his greatness and power? all which were
   brought about by innumerable contingencies and free actions of men. If
   he had not, why should we any longer depend on him, or regard him in
   the several transactions and concernments of our lives?


   "Nullum numen abest, [215] si sit prudentia: nos te,

   Nos facimus, Fortuna, Deam."

   If he had to do with it, as Joseph thought he had, when he affirmed
   plainly that" God sent him thither, and made him a father to Pharaoh
   and his house.," Gen. xlv. 5-8, then the whole was known to God before,
   for "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world."
   And if God may know any one free action beforehand, he may know all,
   for there is the same reason of them all. Their contingency is given as
   the only cause why they may not be known, Now, every action that is
   contingent is equally interested therein. "A quatenus ad omne valet
   argumentum." That place of the psalm before recited, Ps. cxxxix. 2-6,
   is express as to the knowledge of God concerning our free actions that
   are yet future. If any thing in the world may be reckoned amongst our
   free actions, surely our thoughts may; and such a close reserved
   treasure are they that Mr B. doth more than insinuate, in the
   application of the texts of Scripture which he mentioneth, that God
   knoweth them not when present without search and inquiry. But these,
   saith the psalmist, "God knoweth afar off," -- before we think them,
   before they enter into our hearts. And truly I marvel that any man, not
   wholly given up to a spirit of giddiness, after he had produced this
   text of Scripture to prove that God knows our thoughts, should
   instantly subjoin a question leading men to a persuasion that God knows
   not our free actions that are future; unless it was with a Julian
   design, to impair the credit of the word of God, by pretending it
   liable to self-contradiction, or, with Lucian, to deride God as bearing
   contrary testimonies concerning himself.

   2. God hath, by himself and his holy prophets, which have been from the
   foundation of the world, foretold many of the free actions of men, what
   they would do, what they should do, long before they were born who were
   to do them. [216] To give a little light to this argument, which of
   itself will easily overwhelm all that stands before it, I shall handle
   it under these propositions:-- (1.) That God hath so foretold the free
   actions of men. (2.) That so he could not do unless he knew them, and
   that they would be, then when he foretold them. (3.) That he proves
   himself to be God by these his predictions. (4.) That he foretells them
   as the means of executing many of his judgments which he hath purposed
   and threatened, and the accomplishment of many mercies which he hath
   promised, so that the denial of his foresight of them so exempts them
   from under his providence as to infer that he rules not in the world by
   punishments and rewards.

   For the first:-- (1.) There needs no great search or inquiry after
   witnesses to confirm the truth of it; the Scripture is full of such
   predictions from one end to the other. Some few instances shall
   suffice: Gen. xviii. 18, 19, "Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a
   great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be
   blessed in him; for I know him, that he will command his children and
   his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do
   justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which
   he hath spoken of him." Scarce a word but is expressive of some future
   contingent thing, if the free actions of men be so before they are
   wrought. That "Abraham should become a mighty nation," that "all the
   nations of the earth should be blessed in him," that he would "command
   his children and his household after him to keep the ways of the Lord,"
   it was all to be brought about by the free actions of Abraham and of
   others; and all this "I know," saith the Lord, and accordingly declares
   it. By the way, if the Lord knew all this before, his following trial
   of Abraham was not to satisfy himself whether he feared him or no, as
   is pretended.

   So also Gen. xv. 13, 14, "And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that
   thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall
   serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also
   that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall
   they come out with great substance." The Egyptians' affliction on the
   Israelites was by their free actions, if any be free. It was their sin
   to do it; they sinned in all that they did for the effecting of it.
   And, doubtless, if any men's sinful actions are free, yet doth God here
   foretell "They shall afflict them."

   Deut. xxxi. 16-18, you have an instance beyond all possible exception:
   "And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
   fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods
   of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and
   will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
   Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will
   forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be
   devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they
   will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God
   is not among us?" etc. The sum of a good part of what is recorded in
   the Book of Judges is here foretold by God. The people's going a
   whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, their forsaking of
   God, their breaking his covenant, the thoughts of their hearts and
   their expressions upon the consideration of the evils and afflictions
   that should befall them, were of their free actions; but now all these
   doth God here foretell, and thereby engages the honour of his truth
   unto the certainty of their coming to pass.

   1 Kings xiii. 2 is signal to the same purpose: "O altar, altar, behold,
   a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon
   thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that bum incense
   upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon then" This prediction is
   given out three hundred years before the birth of Josiah. The
   accomplishment of it you have in the story, 2 Kings xxiii. 17. Did
   Josiah act freely? was his proceeding at Bethel by free actions, or no?
   If not, how shall we know what actions of men are free, what not? If it
   was, his free actions are here foretold, and therefore, I think,
   foreseen.

   1 Kings xxii. 28, the prophet Micaiah, in the name of the Lord, having
   foretold a thing that was contingent, and which was accomplished by a
   man acting at a venture, lays the credit of his prophecy (and therein
   his life, for if he had proved false as to the event he was to have
   suffered death by the law) at stake, before all the people, upon the
   certainty of the issue foretold: "And Micaiah said, If thou return at
   all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O
   people, every one of you."

   Of these predictions the Scripture is full. The prophecies of Cyrus in
   Isaiah, of the issue of the Babylonish war and kingdom of Judah in
   Jeremiah, of the several great alterations and changes in the empires
   of the world in Daniel, of the kingdom of Christ in them all, are too
   long to be insisted on. The reader may also consult Matt. xxiv. 5; Mark
   xiii. 6, xiv. 30; Acts xx. 29; 2 Thess. ii. 3, 4, etc.; 1 Tim. iv. 1; 2
   Tim. iii. 1; 2 Pet. ii. 1; and the Revelation almost throughout. Our
   first proposition, then, is undeniably evident, That God, by himself
   and by his prophets, hath foretold things future, even the free actions
   of men.

   (2.) The second proposition mentioned is manifest and evident in its
   own light: What God foretelleth, that he perfectly foreknows. The
   honour and repute of his veracity and truth, yea, of his being, depend
   on the certain accomplishment of what he absolutely foretells. If his
   predictions of things future are not bottomed on his certain prescience
   of them, they are all but like Satan's oracles, conjectures and guesses
   of what may be accomplished or not, -- a supposition whereof is as high
   a pitch of blasphemy as any creature in this world can possibly arrive
   unto.

   (3.) By this prerogative of certain predictions in reference to things
   to come, God vindicates his own deity; and from the want of it evinces
   the vanity of the idols of the Gentiles, and the falseness of the
   prophets that pretend to speak in his name: Isa. xli. 21-24, "Produce
   your cause, saith the Lord; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the
   King of Jacob. Let them bring them forth, and show us what shall
   happen: let them show the former things, what they be; or declare us
   things for to come. Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we
   may know that ye are gods. Behold, ye are of nothing." The Lord calling
   forth the idols of the Gentiles, devils, stocks, and stones, to plead
   for themselves, before the denunciation of the solemn sentence ensuing,
   verse 24, he puts them to the plea of foreknowledge for the proof of
   their deity. If they can foretell things to come certainly and
   infallibly, on the account of their own knooedge of them, gods they
   are, and gods they shall be esteemed. If not, saith he, "Ye are
   nothing, worse than nothing, and your work of nought; an abomination is
   he that chooseth you." And it may particularly be remarked, that the
   idols of whom he speaketh are in especial those of the Chaldeans, whose
   worshippers pretended above all men in the world to divination and
   predictions. Now, this issue doth the Lord drive things to betwixt
   himself and the idols of the world: If they can foretell things to
   come, that is, not this or that thing (for so, by conjecture, upon
   consideration of second causes and the general dispositions of things,
   they may do, and the devil hath done), but any thing or every thing,
   they shall go free; that is, "Is there nothing hid from you that is yet
   for to be?" Being not able to stand before this interrogation, they
   perish before the judgment mentioned. But now, if it may be replied to
   the living God himself that this is a most unequal way of proceeding,
   to lay that burden upon the shoulders of others which himself will not
   bear, bring others to that trial which himself cannot undergo, for he
   himself cannot foretell the free actions of men, because he doth not
   foreknow them, would not his plea render him like to the idols whom he
   adjudgeth to shame and confusion? God himself there, concluding that
   they are "vanity and nothing" who are pretended to be gods but are not
   able to foretell the things that are for to come, asserts his own
   deity, upon the account of his infinite understanding and knowledge of
   all things, on the account whereof he can foreshow all things whatever
   that are as yet future. In like manner doth he proceed to evince what
   is from himself, what not, in the predictions of any, from the
   certainty of the event: Deut. xviii. 21, 22, "If thou say in thine
   heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken? When
   a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not,
   nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but
   the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of
   him."

   (4.) The fourth proposition, That God by the free actions of men (some
   whereof he foretelleth) doth fulfil his own counsel as to judgments and
   mercies, rewards and punishments, needs no farther proof or
   confirmation but what will arise from a mere review of the things
   before mentioned, by God so foretold, as was to be proved. They were
   things of the greatest import in the world, as to the good or evil of
   the inhabitants thereof, and in whose accomplishment as much of the
   wisdom, power, righteousness, and mercy of God was manifest, as in any
   of the works of his providence whatever. Those things which he hath
   [so] disposed of as to be subservient to so great ends, certainly he
   knew that they would be. The selling of Joseph, the crucifying of his
   Son, the destruction of antichrist, are things of greater concernment
   than that God should only conjecture at their event. And, indeed, the
   taking away of God's foreknowledge of things contingent renders his
   providence useless as to the government of the world. To what end
   should any rely upon him, seek unto him, commit themselves to his care
   through the course of their lives, when he knows not what will or may
   befall them the next day? How shall he judge or rule the world who
   every moment is surprised with new emergencies which he foresaw not,
   which must necessitate him to new counsels and determinations? On the
   consideration of this argument doth Episcopius conclude for the
   prescience of God, Ep. ii., "ad Beverovicium de termino vitæ," [217]
   which he had allowed to be questioned in his private Theological
   Disputations, [218] though in his public afterward he pleads for it.
   The sum of the argument insisted on amounts to this:--

   Those things which God foretells that they shall certainly and
   infallibly come to pass before they so do, those he certainly and
   infallibly knoweth whilst they are future, and that they will come to
   pass; but God foretells, and hath foretold, all manner of future
   contingencies and free actions of men, good and evil, duties and sins:
   therefore he certainly and infallibly knows them whilst they are yet
   future.

   The proposition stands or falls unto the honour of God's truth,
   veracity, and power.

   The assumption is proved by the former and sundry other instances that
   may be given.

   He foretold that the Egyptians should afflict his people four hundred
   years, that in so doing they would sin, and that for it he would punish
   them, Gen. xv. 13, 14; and surely the Egyptians' sinning therein was
   their own free action. The incredulity of the Jews, treachery of Judas,
   calling of the Gentiles, all that happened to Christ in the days of his
   flesh, the coming of antichrist, the rise of false teachers, were all
   foretold, and did all of them purely depend on the free actions of men;
   which was to be demonstrated.

   3. To omit many other arguments, and to close this discourse: all
   perfections are to be ascribed to God; they are all in him. To know is
   an excellency; he that knows any thing is therein better than he that
   knows it not. The more any one knows, the more excellent is he. To know
   all things is an absolute perfection in the good of knowledge; to know
   them in and by himself who so knows them, and not from any discourses
   made to him from without, is an absolute perfection in itself, and is
   required where there is infinite wisdom and understanding. This we
   ascribe to God, as worthy of him, and as by himself ascribed to
   himself. To affirm, on the other side, -- (1.) That God hath his
   knowledge from things without him, and so is taught wisdom and
   understanding, as we are, from the event of things, for the more any
   one knows the wiser he is; (2.) That he hath, as we have, a successive
   knowledge of things, knowing that one day which he knew not another,
   and that thereupon there is, -- (3.) A daily and hourly change and
   alteration in him, as, from the increasing of his knowledge there must
   actually and formally be; and, (4.) That he sits conjecturing at
   events; -- to assert, I say, these and the like monstrous figments
   concerning God and his knowledge, is, as much as in them lieth who so
   assert them, to shut his providence out of the world, and to divest him
   of all his blessedness, self-sufficiency, and infinite perfections.
   And, indeed, if Mr B. believe his own principles, and would speak out,
   he must assert these things, how desperate soever; for having granted
   the premises, it is stupidity to stick at the conclusion. And therefore
   some of those whom Mr B. is pleased to follow in these wild vagaries
   speak out, and say (though with as much blasphemy as confidence) that
   God doth only conjecture and guess at future contingents; for when this
   argument is brought, Gen. xviii. 19, "?I know,' saith God, Abraham,
   that he will command his children and his household after him,' etc.,
   therefore future contingents may be certainly known of him," they deny
   the consequence; or, granting that he may be said to know them, yet say
   it is only by guess and conjecture, as we do. [219] And for the present
   vindication of the attributes of God this may suffice.

   Before I close this discourse, it may not be impertinent to divert a
   little to that which alone seems to be of any difficulty lying in our
   way in the assertion of this prescience of God, though no occasion of
   its consideration be administered to us by him with whom we have to do.

   "That future contingents have not in themselves a determinate truth,
   and therefore cannot be determinately known," is the great plea of
   those who oppose God's certain foreknowledge of them; "and therefore,"
   say they, "doth the philosopher affirm that propositions concerning
   them are neither true nor false." [220] But, --

   1. That there is, or may be, that there hath been, a certain prediction
   of future contingents hath been demonstrated; and therefore they must
   on some account or other (and what that account is hath been declared)
   have a determinate truth. And I had much rather conclude that there are
   certain predictions of future contingents in the Scripture, and
   therefore they have a determinate truth, than, on the contrary, they
   have no determinate truth, therefore there are no certain predictions
   of them. "Let God be true, and every man a liar."

   2. As to the falsity of that pretended axiom, this proposition, "Such a
   soldier shall pierce the side of Christ with a spear, or he shall not
   pierce him," is determinately true and necessary on the one side or the
   other, the parts of it being contradictory, which cannot lie together.
   Therefore, if a man before the flood had used this proposition in the
   affirmative, it had been certainly and determinately true; for that
   proposition which was once not true cannot be true afterward upon the
   same account.

   3. If no affirmative proposition about future contingents be
   determinately true, then every such affirmative proposition is
   determinately false; for from hence, that a thing is or is not, is a
   proposition determinately true or false. [221] And therefore if any one
   shall say that that is determinately future which is absolutely
   indifferent, his affirmation is false; which is contrary to Aristotle,
   whom in this they rely upon, who affirms that such propositions are
   neither true nor false. The truth is, of propositions that they are
   true or false is certain. Truth or falseness are their proper and
   necessary affections, as even and odd of numbers; nor can any
   proposition be given wherein there is a contradiction, whereof one part
   is true and the other false.

   4. This proposition, "Petrus orat," is determinately true de præsenti,
   when Peter doth actually pray (for "quicquid est, dum est, determinate
   est"); therefore this proposition de future, "Petrus orabit," is
   determinately true. The former is the measure and rule by which we
   judge of the latter. So that because it is true de presenti, "Petrus
   orat;" ergo this, de futuro, "Petrus orabit," was ab æterno true (ex
   parte rei). And then (ex parte modi) because this proposition, "Petrus
   orat," is determinately true de præsenti; ergo this, "Petrus orabit,"
   was determinately true from all eternity. [222] But enough of this.

   Mr B. having made a sad complaint of the ignorance and darkness that
   men were bred up in by being led from the Scripture, and imposing
   himself upon them for "a guide of the blind, a light of them which are
   in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, and a teacher of babes,"
   doth, in pursuit of his great undertaking, in this chapter instruct
   them what the Scripture speaks concerning the being, nature, and
   properties of God. Of his goodness, wisdom, power, truth,
   righteousness, faithfulness, mercy, independency, sovereignty,
   infiniteness, men had before been informed by books, tracts, and
   catechisms, "composed according to the fancies and interests of men,
   the Scripture being utterly justled out of the way." Alas! of these
   things the Scripture speaks not at all; but the description wherein
   that abounds of God, and which is necessary that men should know
   (whatever become of those other inconsiderable things wherewith other
   poor catechisms are stuffed), is, that he is finite, limited, and
   obnoxious to passions, etc. "Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou
   commit sacrilege?"

  Examination.

   Having delivered his thoughts concerning God himself, his nature and
   properties, in the foregoing chapters, in this our catechist proceeds
   to the consideration of his works, ascribing to God the creation of all
   things, especially insisting on the making of man. Now, although many
   questions might be proposed from which Mr B. would, I suppose, be
   scarcely able to extricate himself, relating to the impossibility of
   the proceeding of such a work as the creation of all things from such
   an agent as he hath described God to be, so limited both in his essence
   and properties, yet it being no part of my business to dispute or
   perplex any thing that is simply in itself true and unquestionable,
   with the attendancies of it from other corrupt notions of him or them
   by whom it is received and proposed, I shall wholly omit all
   considerations of that nature, and apply myself merely to what is by
   him expressed. That he who is limited and finite in essence, and
   consequently in properties, should by his power, without the help of
   any intervening instrument, out of nothing, produce, at such a vast
   distance from him as his hands can by no means reach unto, such mighty
   effects as the earth itself and the fulness thereof, is not of an easy
   proof or resolution. But on these things at present I shall not insist.
   Certain it is that, on this apprehension of God, the Epicureans
   disputed for the impassibility of the creation of the world. [223]

   His first question, then, is, "Were the heaven and earth from all
   eternity, or created at a certain time? and by whom?" To which he
   answers with Gen. i. 1, "In the beginning God created the heaven and
   the earth."

   Right. Only in the exposition of this verse, as it discovers the
   principal efficient cause of the creation of all things, or the author
   of this great work, Mr B. afterward expounds himself to differ from us
   and the word of God in other places. By "God" he intends the Father
   only and exclusively, the Scripture plentifully ascribing this work
   also to the Son and Holy Ghost, manifesting their concurrence in the
   indivisible Deity unto this great work, though, by way of eminency,
   this work be attributed to the Father, as that of redemption is to the
   Son, and that of regeneration to the Holy Ghost, from neither of which
   notwithstanding is the Father excluded.

   Perhaps the using of the name of God in the plural number, where
   mention is made of the creation, in conjunction with a verb singular,
   Gen. i. 1, and the express calling of God our Creators and Makers,
   Eccles. xii. 1, Ps. cxlix. 2, Job xxxv. 10, wants not a significancy to
   this thing. [224] And indeed he that shall consider the miserable
   evasions that the adversaries have invented to escape the argument
   thence commonly insisted on must needs be confirmed in the persuasion
   of the force of it. [225] Mr B. may haply close with Plato in this
   business, who, in his "Timæus," brings in his demiourgos speaking to
   his genii about the making of man, telling them that they were mortal,
   but encouraging them to obey him in the making of other creatures, upon
   the promise of immortality. "Turn you," saith he, "according to the law
   of nature, to the making of living creatures, and imitate my power
   which I used in your generation or birth;" [226] -- a speech fit enough
   for Mr B.'s god, "who is shut up in heaven," and not able of himself to
   attend his whole business. But what a sad success this demiurgus had,
   by his want of prescience, or foresight of what his demons would do
   (wherein also Mr B. likens God unto him), is farther declared; for they
   imprudently causing a conflux of too much matter and humour, no small
   tumult followed thereon in heaven, as at large you may see in the same
   author. However, it is said expressly the Son or Word created all
   things, John i. 3; and, "By him are all things," 1 Cor. viii. 6, Rev.
   iv. 11. Of the Holy Ghost the same is alarmed, Gen. i. 2, Job xxvi. 13,
   Ps. xxxiii. 6. Nor can the Word and Spirit be degraded from the place
   of principal efficient cause in this work to a condition of
   instrumentality only, which is urged (especially in reference to the
   Spirit), unless we shall suppose them to have been created before say
   creation, sad to have been instrumental of their own production. But of
   these things in their proper place.

   His second question is, "How long was God in making them?" and he
   answers from Exod. xx. 11, "In six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
   the sea, and all that in them is."

   The rule I formerly prescribed to myself of dealing with Mr B. causes
   me to pass this question also without farther inquiry; although, having
   already considered what his notions are concerning the nature and
   properties of God, I can scarce avoid conjecturing that by this crude
   proposal of the time wherein the work of God's creation was finished,
   there is an intendment to insinuate such a gross conception of the
   working of God as will By no means be suited to his omnipotent
   production of all things. But speaking of things no farther than
   enforced, I shall not insist on this query.

   His third is, "How did God create man?" and the answer is, Gen. ii. 7.
   To which he adds a fourth, "How did he create woman?" which he resolves
   from Gen. ii. 21, 22.

   Mr B., undertaking to give all the grounds of religion in his
   Catechisms, teacheth as well by his silence as his expressions. What he
   mentions not, in the known doctrine he opposeth, he may well be
   interpreted to reject. As to the matter whereof man sad woman were
   made, Mr B.'s answers do express it; but as to the condition and state
   wherein they were made, of that he is silent, though he knows the
   Scripture doth much more abound in delivering the one than the other.
   Neither can his silence in this thing be imputed to oversight or
   forgetfulness, considering how subservient it is to his intendment in
   his last two questions, for the subverting of the doctrine of original
   sin, and the denial of all those effects and consequences of the first
   breach of covenant whereof he speaks. He can, upon another account,
   take notice that man was made in the imago of God: but whereas hitherto
   Christians have supposed that that denoted some spiritual perfection
   bestowed on man, wherein he resembles God, Mr B. hath discovered that
   it is only an expression of some imperfection of God, wherein he
   resembles man; which yet he will as hardly persuade us of as that a man
   hath seven eyes or two wings, which are ascribed unto God also. That
   man was created in a resemblance and likeness unto God in that immortal
   substance breathed into his nostrils, Gen. ii. 7, in the excellent
   rational faculties thereof, in the dominion he was intrusted withal
   over a great part of God's creation, but especially in the integrity
   and uprightness of his person, Eccles. vii. 29, wherein he stood before
   God, in reference to the obedience required at his hands, -- which
   condition, by the implanting of new qualities in our soul, we are,
   through Christ, in some measure renewed unto, Col. iii. 10, 12, Eph.
   iv. 24, -- the Scripture is clear, evident, and full in the discovery
   of; but hereof Mr B. conceive, not himself bound to take notice. But
   what is farther needful to be spoken as to the state of man before the
   fall will fall under the consideration of the last question of this
   chapter.

   Mr B.'s process in the following questions is, to express the story of
   man's outward condition, unto the eighth, where he inquires after the
   commandment given of God to man when he put him into the garden, in
   these words:-- "Q. What commandment gave he to the man when he put him
   into the garden?" This he resolves from Gen. ii. 16, 17. That God gave
   our first parents the command expressed is undeniable. That the matter
   chiefly expressed in that command was all or the principal part of what
   he required of them, Mr B. doth not go about to prove. I shall only
   desire to know of him whether God did not in that estate require of
   them that they should love him, fear him, believe him, acknowledge
   their dependence on him, in universal obedience to his will? and
   whether a suitableness unto all this duty were not wrought within them
   by God? If he shall say No, and that God required no more of them but
   only not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, I desire to
   know whether they might have hated God, abhorred him, believed Satan,
   and yet been free from the threatening here mentioned, if they had only
   forbore the outward eating of the fruit? If this shall be granted, I
   hope I need not insist to manifest what will easily be inferred, nor to
   show how impossible this is, God continuing God, and man a rational
   creature. [227] If he shall say that certainly God did require that
   they should own him for God, -- that is, believe him, love him, fear
   him, and worship him, according to all that he should reveal to them
   and require of them, -- I desire to know whether this particular
   command could be any other than sacramental and symbolical as to the
   matter of it, being a thing of so small importance in its own nature,
   in comparison of those moral acknowledgments of God before mentioned;
   and to that question I shall not need to add more.

   Although it may justly be supposed that Mr B. is not without some
   thoughts of deviation from the truth in the following questions, yet
   the last being of most importance, and he being express therein in
   denying all the effects of the first sin, but only the curse that came
   upon the outward, visible world, I shall insist only on that, and close
   our consideration of this chapter. His question is thus proposed: "Q.
   Did the sin of our first parents in eating of the forbidden fruit bring
   both upon them and their posterity the guilt of hell-fire, deface the
   image of God in them, darken their understandings, enslave their wills,
   deprive them of power to do good, and cause mortality? If not, what are
   the true penalties denounced against them for that offence?" To this he
   answers from Gen. iii. 16-19.

   What the sin of our first parents was may easily be discovered from
   what was said before concerning the commandment given to them. If
   universal obedience was required of them unto God, according to the
   tenor of the law of their creation, their sin was an universal
   rebellion against and apostasy from him; which though it expressed
   itself in the peculiar transgression of that command mentioned, yet it
   is far from being reducible to any one kind of sin, whose whole nature
   is comprised in that expression. Of the effects of this sin commonly
   assigned, Mr B. annumerates and rejects six, sundry whereof are
   coincident with, and all but one reducible to, that general head of
   loss of the image of God; but for the exclusion of them all at once
   from being any effects of the first sin, Mr B. thus argues: "If there
   were no effects or consequences of the first sin but what are expressly
   mentioned, Gen. iii. 16-19, then those now mentioned are no effects of
   it; but there are no effects or consequences of that first sin but what
   are mentioned in that place:" therefore those recounted in his query,
   and commonly esteemed such, are to be cashiered from any such place in
   the thoughts of men.

   Ans. The words insisted on by Mr B. being expressive of the curse of
   God for sin on man, and on the whole creation here below for his sake,
   it will not be easy for him to evince that none of the things he
   rejects are not eminently inwrapped in them. Would God have denounced
   and actually inflicted such a curse on the whole creation, which he had
   put in subjection to man, as well as upon man himself, and actually
   have inflicted it with so much dread and severity as he hath done, if
   the transgression upon the account whereof he did it had not been as
   universal a rebellion against him as could be fallen into? Man fell in
   his whole dependence from God, and is cursed universally, in all his
   concernments, spiritual and temporal.

   But is this indeed the only place of Scripture where the effects of our
   apostasy from God, in the sin of our first parents, are described Mr B.
   may as well tell us that Gen. iii. 15 is the only place where mention
   is made of Jesus Christ, for there he is mentioned. But a little to
   clear this whole matter in our passage, though what hath been spoken
   may suffice to make naked Mr B.'s sophistry:--

   1. By the effects of the first sin, we understand every thing of evil
   that, either within or without, in respect of a present or future
   condition, in reference to God and the fruition of him whereto man was
   created, or the enjoyment of any goodness from God, is come upon
   mankind, by the just ordination and appointment of God, whereunto man
   was not obnoxious in his primitive state and condition. I am not at
   present at all engaged to speak de modo, of what is privative, what
   positive, in original sin, of the way of the traduction or propagation
   of it, of the imputation of the guilt of the first sin, and adhesion of
   the pollution of our nature defiled thereby, or any other questions
   that are coincident with these in the usual inquest made into and after
   the sin of Adam and the fruits of it; but only as to the things
   themselves, which are here wholly denied. Now, --

   2. That whatsoever is evil in man by nature, whatever he is obnoxious
   and liable unto that is hurtful and destructive to him and all men in
   common, in reference to the end whereto they were created, or any title
   wherewith they were at first intrusted, is all wholly the effect of the
   first sin, and is in solidum to be ascribed thereunto, is easily
   demonstrated; for, --

   (1.) That which is common to all things in any kind, and is proper to
   them only of that kind, must needs have some common cause equally
   respecting the whole kind: but now of the evils that are common to all
   mankind, and peculiar or proper to them and every one of them, there
   can be no cause but that which equally concerns them all; which, by the
   testimony of God himself, was this fall of Adam, Rom. v. 12, 15-19.

   (2.) The evils that are now incumbent upon men in their natural
   condition (which what they are shall be afterward considered) were
   either incumbent on them at their first creation, before the sin and
   fall of our first parents, or they are come upon them since, through
   some interposing cause or occasion. That they were not in them or on
   them, that they were not liable or obnoxious to those evils which are
   now incumbent on them, in their first creation, as they came forth from
   the hand of God (besides what was said before of the state and
   condition wherein man was created, even "upright" in the Sight of God,
   in his favour and acceptation, no way obnoxious to his anger and
   wrath), is evident by the light of this one consideration, namely, that
   there was nothing in man nor belonging to him, no respect, no regard or
   relation, but what was purely and immediately of the holy God's
   creation and institution. Now, it is contrary to all that he hath
   revealed or made known to us of himself, that he should be the
   immediate author of so much evil as is now, by his own testimony, in
   man by nature, and, without any occasion, of so much vanity and misery
   as he is subject unto; and, besides, directly thwarting the testimony
   which he gave of all the works of his hands, that they were exceeding
   good, it being evident that man, in the condition whereof we speak, is
   exceeding evil.

   3. If all the evil mentioned hath since befallen mankind, then it hath
   done so either by some chance and accident whereof God was not aware,
   or by his righteous judgment and appointment, in reference to some
   procuring and justly-deserving cause of such a punishment. To affirm
   the first, is upon the matter to deny him to be God; and I doubt not
   but that men at as easy and cheap a rate of sin may deny that there is
   a God, as, confessing his divine essence, to turn it into an idol, and
   by making thick clouds, as Job speaks, to interpose between him and the
   affairs of the world, to exclude his energetical providence in the
   disposal of all the works of his hands. If the latter be affirmed, I
   ask, as before, what other common cause, wherein all and every one of
   mankind is equally concerned, can be assigned of the evils mentioned,
   as the procurement of the wrath and vengeance of God, from whence they
   are, but only the fall of Adam, the sin of our first parents,
   especially considering that the Holy Ghost doth so expressly point out
   this fountain and source of the evils insisted on, Rom. v. 12, 15-19?

   4. These things, then, being premised, it will quickly appear that
   every one of the particulars rejected by Mr B. from being fruits or
   effects of the first sin are indeed the proper issues of it; and though
   Mr B. cut the roll of the abominations and corruptions of the nature of
   man by sin, and cast it into the fire, yet we may easily write it
   again, and add many more words of the like importance.

   The first effect or fruit of the first sin rejected by Mr B. is, "its
   rendering men guilty of hell-fire;" but the Scripture seems to be of
   another mind, Rom. v. 12, "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into
   the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that
   all have sinned." That all men sinned in Adam, that they contracted the
   guilt of the same death with him, that death entered by sin, the Holy
   Ghost is express in. The death here mentioned is that which God
   threatened to Adam if he did transgress, Gen. ii. 17; which that it was
   not death temporal only, yea not at all, Mr B. contends by denying
   mortality to be a fruit of this sin, as also excluding in this very
   query all room for death spiritual, which consists in the defacing of
   the image of God in us, which he with this rejects: and what death
   remains but that which hath hell following after it we shall afterward
   consider.

   Besides, that death which Christ died to deliver us from was that which
   we were obnoxious to upon the account of the first sin; for he came to
   "save that which was lost," and tasted death to deliver us from death,
   dying to "deliver them who through fear of death were all their
   lifetime subject to bondage," Heb. ii. 15. But that this was such a
   death as hath hell-fire attending it, he manifests by affirming that he
   "delivers us from the wrath to come." By "hell-fire" we understand
   nothing but the "wrath of God" for sin; into whose hands it is a
   fearful thing to fall, our God being a consuming fire. That the guilt
   of every sin is this death whereof we speak, that hath both curse and
   wrath attending it, and that it is the proper "wages of sin," the
   testimony of God is evident, Rom. vi. 23. What other death men are
   obnoxious to on the account of the first sin, that hath not these
   concomitants, Mr B. hath not as yet revealed. "By nature," also, we are
   "children of wrath," Eph. ii. 3. And on what foot of account our
   obnoxiousness now by nature unto wrath is to be stated, is sufficiently
   evident by the light of the preceding considerations.

   The "defacing of the image of God in us" by this sin, as it is usually
   asserted, is in the next place denied. That man was created in the
   image of God, and wherein that image of God doth consist, were before
   declared. That we are now born with that character upon us, as it was
   at first enstamped upon us, must be affirmed, or some common cause of
   the defect that is in us, wherein all and every one of the posterity of
   Adam are equally concerned, besides that of the first sin, is to be
   assigned. That this latter cannot be done hath been already declared.
   He that shall undertake to make good the former must engage in a more
   difficult work than Mr B., in the midst of his other employments, is
   willing to undertake. To insist on all particulars relating to the
   image of God in man, how far it is defaced, whether any thing properly
   and directly thereunto belonging be yet left remaining in us; to
   declare how far our souls, in respect of their immortal substance,
   faculties, and consciences, and our persons, in respect of that
   dominion over the creatures which yet, by God's gracious and merciful
   providence, we retain, may be said to bear the image of God, -- is a
   work of another nature than what I am now engaged in. For the asserting
   of what is here denied by Mr B., concerning the defacing of the image
   of God in us by sin, no more is required but only the tender of some
   demonstrations to the main of our intendment in the assertion touching
   the loss by the first sin, and our present want, in the state of
   nature, of that righteousness and holiness wherein man at his first
   creation stood before God (in reference unto the end whereunto he was
   created), in uprightness and ability of walking unto all well-pleasing.
   And as this will be fully manifested in the consideration of the
   ensuing particulars instanced in by Mr B., so it is sufficiently clear
   and evident from the renovation of that image which we have by Jesus
   Christ; and that is expressed both in general and in all the
   particulars wherein we affirm that image to be defaced. "The new man,"
   which we put on in Jesus Christ, which "is renewed in knowledge after
   the image of him that created him," Col. iii. 10, is that which we
   want, by sin's defacing (suo more) of that image of God in us which we
   had in knowledge. So Eph. iv. 23, 24, that new man is said to consist
   in the "renewing of our mind, whereby after God we are created in
   righteousness and holiness." So, then, whereas we were created in the
   image of God, in righteousness and holiness, and are to be renewed
   again by Christ into the same condition of his image in righteousness
   and holiness, we doubt not to affirm that by the first sin (the only
   interposition of general concernment to all the sons of men) the image
   of God in us was exceedingly defaced. In sum, that which made us
   sinners brought sin and death upon us; that which made us liable to
   condemnation, that defaced the image of God in us; and that all this
   was done by the first sin the apostle plainly asserts, Rom. v. 12, 15,
   17-19, etc.

   To the next particular effect of sin by Mr B. rejected, "the darkening
   of our understandings," I shall only inquire of him whether God made us
   at first with our understandings dark and ignorant as to those things
   which are of absolute necessity that we should be acquainted withal,
   for the attainment of the end whereunto he made us? For once I will
   suppose he will not affirm it; and shall therefore proceed one step
   farther, and ask him whether there be not such a darkness now upon us
   by nature, opposed unto that light, that spiritual and saving
   knowledge, which is of absolute necessity for every one to have and be
   furnished withal that will again attain that image of God which we are
   born short of. Now, because this is that which will most probably be
   denied, I shall, by the way, only desire him, --

   1. To cast aside all the places of Scripture where it is positively and
   punctually asserted that we are so dark and blind, and darkness itself,
   in the things of God; and then,

   2. All those where it is no less punctually and positively asserted
   that Christ gives us light, knowledge, understanding, which of
   ourselves we have not. And if he be not able to do so, then,

   3. To tell me whether the darkness mentioned in the former places and
   innumerable others, and [of which mention is made], as to the manner
   and cause of its removal and taking away, in the latter, be part of
   that death which passed on all men "by the offence of one," or by what
   other chance it is come upon us.

   Of the "enslaving of our wills, and the depriving us of power to do
   good," there is the same reason as of that next before. It is not my
   purpose to handle the common-place of the corruption of nature by sin:
   nor can I say that it is well for Mr B. that he finds none of those
   effects of sin in himself, nothing of darkness, bondage, or disability,
   or if he do, that he knows where to charge it, and not on himself and
   the depravedness of his own nature; and that because I know none who
   are more desperately sick than those who, by a fever of pride, have
   lost the sense of their own miserable condition. Only to stop him in
   his haste from rejecting the evils mentioned from being effects or
   consequences of the first sin, I desire him to peruse a little the
   ensuing scriptures; and I take them as they come to mind: Eph. ii. 1-3,
   5; John v. 25; Matt. viii. 22; Eph. v. 8; Luke iv. 18; 2 Tim. ii. 25,
   26; John viii. 34; Rom. vi. 16; Gen. vi. 5; Rom. vii. 5; John iii. 6; 1
   Cor. ii. 14; Rom. iii. 12; Acts viii. 31; John v. 40; Rom. viii. 7;
   Jer. xiii. 23, etc.

   The last thing denied is its "causing mortality." God threatening man
   with death if he sinned, Gen. ii. 17, seems to instruct us that if he
   had not sinned he should not have died; and upon his sin, affirming
   that on that account he should be dissolved and return to his dust,
   Gen. iii. 19, no less evidently convinces us that his sin caused
   mortality actually and in the event. The apostle, also, affirming that
   "death entered by sin, and passed upon all, inasmuch as all have
   sinned," seems to be of our mind. Neither can any other sufficient
   cause be assigned on the account whereof innocent man should have been
   actually mortal or eventually have died. Mr B., it seems, is of another
   persuasion, and, for the confirmation of his judgment, gives you the
   words of the curse of God to man upon his sinning, "Dust thou art, and
   unto dust shalt thou return;" the strength of his reason therein lying
   in this, that if God denounced the sentence of mortality on man after
   sinning, and for his sin, then mortality was not an effect of sin, but
   man was mortal before in the state of innocency. Who doubts but that at
   this rate he may be able to prove what he pleases.

   A brief declaration of our sense in ascribing immortality to the first
   man in the state of innocency, that none may be mistaken in the
   expressions used, may put a close to our consideration of this chapter.
   In respect of his own essence and being, as also of all outward and
   extrinsical causes, God alone is eminently and perfectly immortal; he
   only in that sense hath "life and immortality." [228] Angels and souls
   of men, immaterial substances, are immortal as to their intrinsic
   essence, free from principles of corruption and mortality; but yet are
   obnoxious to it in respect of that outward cause (or the power of God),
   which can at any time reduce them into nothing. The immortality we
   ascribe to man in innocency is only an assured preservation by the
   power of God from actual dying, notwithstanding the possibility thereof
   which he was in upon the account of the constitution of his person, and
   the principles thereunto concurring. So that though from his own nature
   he had a possibility of dying, and in that sense was mortal, yet God's
   institution assigning him life in the way of obedience, he had a
   possibility of not dying, and was in that sense immortal, as hath been
   declared. [229] If any one desire farther satisfaction herein, let him
   consult Johannes Junius' answer to Socinus' Prelections, in the first
   chapter whereof he pretends to answer in proof the assertion in title,
   "Primus homo ante lapsum natura mortalis fuit;" wherein he partly
   mistakes the thing in question, which respects not the constitution of
   man's nature, but the event of the condition wherein he was created,
   [230] and himself in another place states it better. [231]

   The sum of the whole may be reduced to what follows:-- Simply and
   absolutely immortal is God only: "He only hath immortality," 1 Tim. vi.
   16. Immortal in respect of its whole substance or essence is that which
   is separate from all matter, which is the principle of corruption, as
   angels, or is not educed from the power of it, whither of its own
   accord it should again resolve, as the souls of men. The bodies also of
   the saints in heaven, yea, and of the wicked in hell, shall be
   immortal, though in their own natures corruptible, being changed and
   preserved by the power of God. Adam was mortal as to the constitution
   of his body, which was apt to die; immortal in respect of his soul in
   its own substance; immortal in their union by God's appointment, and
   from his preservation upon his continuance in obedience. By the
   composition of his body before his fall, he had a posse mori; by the
   appointment of God, a posse non mori; by his fall, a non posse non
   mori.

   In this estate, on his disobedience, he was threatened with death; and
   therefore was obedience the tenure whereby he held his grant of
   immortality, which on his neglect he was penally to be deprived of. In
   that estate he had, -- (1.) The immortality mentioned, or a power of
   not dying, from the appointment of God; (2.) An uprightness and
   integrity of his person before God, with an ability to walk with him in
   all the obedience he required, being made in the image of God and
   upright; (3.) A right, upon his abode in that condition, to an
   eternally blessed life; which he should (4.) actually have enjoyed, for
   he had a pledge of it in the" tree of life" He lost it for himself and
   us; which if he never had it he could not do. The death wherewith he
   was threatened stood in opposition to all these, it being most
   ridiculous to suppose that any thing penal in the Scripture comes under
   the name of "death" that was not here threatened to Adam; -- death of
   the body, in a deprivation of his immortality spoken of; of the soul
   spiritually, in sin, by the loss of his righteousness and integrity; of
   both, in their obnoxiousness to death eternal; actually to be
   undergone, without deliverance by Christ, in opposition to the right to
   a better, a blessed condition, which he had. That all these are penal,
   and called in the Scriptures by the name of "death," is evident to all
   that take care to know what is contained in them.

   For a close, then, of this chapter and discourse, let us also propose a
   few questions as to the matter under consideration, and see what answer
   the Scripture will positively give in to our inquiries:--

   First, then, --

   Ques. 1. In what state and condition was man at first created?

   Ans. "God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
   him; male and female created he them," Gen. i. 27. "And God saw every
   thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good," verse 31. "In
   the image of God made he man," chap. ix. 6. "Lo, this only have I
   found, that God hath made man upright," Eccles. vii. 29. "Put on the
   new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
   holiness," Eph. iv. 24. "Put on the new man, which is renewed in
   knowledge after the image of him that created him," Col. iii. 10.

   Q. 2. Should our first parents have died had they not sinned, or were
   they obnoxious to death in the state of innocency?

   A. "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
   garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good
   and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest
   thereof thou shalt surely die," Gen. ii. 16, 17. "By one man sin
   entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all
   men, for that all have sinned," Rom. v. 12. "For the wages of sin is
   death," Rom. vi. 23.

   Q. 3. Are we now, since the fall, born with the image of God so
   enstamped on us as at our first creation in Adam?

   A. "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God," Rom. iii. 23.
   "Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man uptight; but they
   have sought out many inventions," Eccles. vii. 29. "So then they that
   are in the flesh cannot please God," Rom. viii. 8. "And you who were
   dead in trespasses and sins," Eph. ii. 1. "For we ourselves also were
   sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and
   pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another,"
   Tit. iii. 3. "The old man is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,"
   Eph. iv. 22.

   Q. 4. Are we now born approved of God and accepted with him, as when we
   were first created, or what is our condition now by nature? what say
   the Scriptures hereunto?

   A. "We were by nature the children of wrath, even as others," Eph. ii.
   3. "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God," John
   iii. 3. "He that believeth not the Son, the wrath of God abideth on
   him," verse 36. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh," John iii.
   6.

   Q. 5. Are our understandings by nature able to discern the things of
   God, or are they darkened and blind?

   A. "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for
   they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they
   are spiritually discerned," 1 Cor. ii. 14. "The light shineth in
   darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not," John i. 5. "To preach
   deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind,"
   Luke iv. 18. "Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from
   the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the
   blindness of their heart," Eph. iv. 18. "Ye were sometimes darkness,
   but now are ye light in the Lord," chap. v. 8. "For God, who commanded
   the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give
   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
   Christ," 2 Cor. iv. 6. "And we know that the Son of God is come, and
   hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true," 1
   John v. 20.

   Q. 6. Are we able to do those things now, in the state of nature, which
   are spiritually good and acceptable to God?

   A. "The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the
   law of God, neither indeed can be," Rom. viii. 7. "You were dead in
   trespasses and sins," Eph. ii. 1. "The imagination of man's heart is
   evil from his youth," Gen. viii. 21. "Can the Ethiopian change his
   skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are
   accustomed to do evil," Jer. xiii. 23. "For without me ye can do
   nothing," John xv. 5. "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think
   any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God," 2 Cor. iii.
   5. "For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good
   thing," Rom. vii. 18.

   Q. 7. How came we into this miserable state and condition?

   A. "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive
   me," Ps. li. 5. "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not
   one," Job xiv. 4. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh," John iii.
   6. "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
   sin; so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned," Rom. v.
   12.

   Q. 8. Is, then, the guilt of the first sin of our first parents
   reckoned unto us?

   A. "But not as the offence, so also is the free gift, For through the
   offence of one many be dead," Rom. v. 15. "And not as it was by one
   that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to
   condemnation," verse 16. "For by one man's offence death reigned,"
   verse 17. "Therefore by the offence of one judgment came upon all men
   to condemnation," verse 18. "By one man's disobedience many were made
   sinners," verse 19.

   Thus, and much more fully, doth the Scripture set out and declare the
   condition of man both before and after the fall; concerning which,
   although the most evident demonstration of the latter lies in the
   revelation made of the exceeding efficacy of that power and grace which
   God in Christ puts forth for our conversion and delivery from that
   state and condition before described, yet so much is spoken of this
   dark side of it as will render vain the attempts of any who shall
   endeavour to plead the cause of corrupted nature, or alleviate the
   guilt of the first sin.

   It may not be amiss, in the winding up of the whole, to give the reader
   a brief account of what slight thoughts this gentleman and his
   companions have concerning this whole matter of the state and condition
   of the first man, his fall or sin, and the interest of all his
   posterity therein, which confessedly lie at the bottom of that whole
   dispensation of grace in Jesus Christ which is revealed in the gospel.

   First. [As] for Adam himself, they are so remote from assigning to him
   any eminency of knowledge, righteousness, or holiness, in the state,
   wherein he was created, that, --

   1. For his knowledge, they say, "He was a mere great baby, that knew
   not that he was naked;" [232] so also taking away the difference
   between the simple knowledge of nakedness in innocency, and the
   knowledge joined with shame that followed sin. "Of his wife he knew no
   more but what occurred to his senses;" [233] though the expressions
   which he used at first view and sight of her do plainly argue another
   manner of apprehension, Gen. ii. 23. For "the tree of the knowledge of
   good and evil, he knew not the virtue of it;" [234] which yet I know
   not how it well agrees with another place of the same author, where he
   concludes that in the state of innocency there was in Adam a real
   predominancy of the natural appetite, which conquered or prevailed to
   the eating of the fruit of that tree. [235] Also, that being mortal, he
   knew not himself to be so. [236] The sum is, he was even a very beast,
   that knew neither himself, his duty, nor the will of God concerning
   him.

   2. [As] for his righteousness and holiness, which, as was said before,
   because he was made upright, in the image of God, we ascribe unto him,
   Socinus contends in one whole chapter in his Prelections, "that he was
   neither just nor holy, nor ought to be so esteemed nor called." [237]

   And Smalcius, in his confutation of Franzius' "Theses de Peccato
   Originali," all along derides and laughs to scorn the apprehension or
   persuasion that Adam was created in righteousness and holiness, or that
   ever he lost any thing of the image of God, or that ever he had any
   thing of the image of God beyond or besides that dominion over the
   creatures which God gave him. [238]

   Most of the residue of the herd, describing the estate and condition of
   man in his creation, do wholly omit any mention of any moral
   uprightness in him. [239]

   And this is the account these gentlemen give us concerning the
   condition and state wherein the first man was of God created: A heavy
   burden of the earth it seems he was, that had neither righteousness nor
   holiness whereby he might be enabled to walk before God in reference to
   that great end whereunto he was created, nor any knowledge of God,
   himself, or his duty.

   Secondly. [As] for his sin, the great master of their family disputes
   that it was a bare transgression of that precept of "not eating the
   fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil," and that his nature
   was not vitiated or corrupted thereby: [240] wherein he is punctually
   followed by the Racovian Catechism, which also giveth this reason why
   his nature was not depraved by it, namely, because it was but one act;
   -- so light are their thoughts and expressions of that great
   transgression! [241]

   Thirdly. [As] for his state and condition, they all, with open mouth,
   cry out that he was mortal and obnoxious to death, which should in a
   natural way have come upon him though he had not sinned. [242] But of
   this before.

   Fourthly. Farther; that the posterity of Adam were no way concerned, as
   to their spiritual prejudice, in that sin of his, as though they should
   either partake of the guilt of it or have their nature vitiated or
   corrupted thereby; but that the whole doctrine of original sin is a
   figment of Austin and the schoolmen that followed him, is the constant
   clamour of them all. [243] And indeed this is the great foundation of
   all or the greatest part of their religion. Hence are the necessity of
   the satisfaction and merit of Christ, the efficacy of grace, and the
   power of the Spirit in conversion, decried. On this account is
   salvation granted, by them, without Christ, a power of keeping all the
   commandments asserted, and justification upon our obedience. Of which
   in the process of our discourse.

   Such are the thoughts, such are the expressions, of Mr B.'s masters
   concerning this whole matter. Such was Adam in their esteem, such was
   his fall, and such our concernment therein. [244] He had no
   righteousness, no holiness (yea, Socinus at length confesses that he
   did not believe his soul was immortal [245] ); we contracted no guilt
   in him, derive no pollution from him. Whether these men are in any
   measure acquainted with the plague of their own hearts, the severity
   and spirituality of the law of God, with that redemption which is in
   the blood of Jesus, the Lord will one day manifest; but into their
   secret let not my soul descend.

   Lest the weakest or meanest reader should be startled with the mention
   of these things, not finding himself ready furnished with arguments
   from Scripture to disprove the boldness and folly of these men in their
   assertions, I shall add some few arguments whereby the severals by them
   denied and opposed are confirmed from the Scriptures, the places before
   mentioned being in them cast into that form and method wherein they are
   readily subservient to the purpose in hand:--

   First. That man was created in the image of God, in knowledge,
   righteousness, and holiness, is evident on the ensuing
   considerations:--

   1. He who was made "very good" and "upright," in a moral consideration,
   had the original righteousness pleaded for; for moral goodness,
   integrity, and uprightness, is equivalent unto righteousness. So are
   the words used in the description of Job, chap. i. 1; and "righteous"
   and "upright" are terms equivalent, Ps. xxxiii. 1. Now, that man was
   made thus good and upright was manifested in the scriptures cited in
   answer to the question before proposed, concerning the condition
   wherein our first parents were created. And, indeed, this uprightness
   of man, this moral rectitude, was his formal aptitude and fitness for
   and unto that obedience which God required of him, and which was
   necessary for the end whereunto he was created.

   2. He who was created perfect in his kind was created with the original
   righteousness pleaded for. This is evident from hence, because
   righteousness and holiness is a perfection of a rational being made for
   the service of God. This in angels is called "the truth," or that
   original holiness and rectitude which "the devil abode not in," John
   viii. 44. Now, as before, man was created "very good" and "upright,"
   therefore perfect as to his state and condition; and whatever is in him
   of imperfection flows from the corruption and depravation of nature.

   3. He that was created in the image of God was created in a state of
   righteousness, holiness, and knowledge. That Adam was created in the
   image of God is plainly affirmed in Scripture, and is not denied. That
   by the "image of God" is especially intended the qualities mentioned,
   is manifest from that farther description of the image of God which we
   have given us in the scriptures before produced in answer to our first
   question. And what is recorded of the first man in his primitive
   condition will not suffer us to esteem him such a baby in knowledge as
   the Socinians would make him. His imposing of names on all creatures,
   his knowing of his wife on first view, etc., exempt him from that
   imputation. Yea, the very heathens could conclude that he was very wise
   indeed who first gave names to things. [246]

   Secondly. For the disproving of that mortality which they ascribe to
   man in innocency the ensuing arguments may suffice:--

   1. He that was created in the image of God, in righteousness and
   holiness, whilst he continued in that state and condition, was
   immortal. That man was so created lies under the demonstration of the
   foregoing arguments and testimonies. The assertion thereupon, or the
   inference of immortality from the image of God, appears on this double
   consideration:-- (1.) In our renovation by Christ into the image of
   God, we are renewed to a blessed immortality; and our likeness to God
   consisted no less in that than in any other communicable property of
   his nature. (2.) Wherever is naturally perfect righteousness, there is
   naturally perfect life; that is, immortality. This is included in the
   very tenor of the promise of the law: "If man keep my statutes, he
   shall live in them," Lev. xviii. 5.

   2. That which the first man contracted and drew upon himself by sin was
   not natural to him before he sinned: but that man contracted and drew
   death upon himself, or made himself liable and obnoxious unto it by
   sin, is proved by all the texts of Scripture that were produced above
   in answer to our second question; as Gen. ii. 17, iii. 19; Rom. v. 12,
   15, 17-19, vi. 23, etc.

   3. That which is beside and contrary to nature was not natural to the
   first man; but death is beside and contrary to nature, as the voice of
   nature abundantly testifieth: therefore, to man in his primitive
   condition it was not natural.

   Unto these may sundry other arguments be added, from the promise of the
   law, the end of man's obedience, his constitution and state, denying
   all proximate causes of death, etc; but these may suffice.

   Thirdly. That the sin of Adam is not to be confined to the mere eating
   of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but had its
   rise in infidelity, and comprised universal apostasy from God, in
   disobedience to the law of his creation and dependence on God, I have
   elsewhere demonstrated, and shall not need here again to insist upon
   it. [247] That it began in infidelity is evident from the beginning of
   the temptation wherewith he was overcome. It was to doubt of the truth
   or veracity of God to which the woman was at first solicited by Satan:
   Gen. iii. 1," Hath God said so?" pressing that it should be otherwise
   than they seemed to have cause to apprehend from what God said; and
   their acquiescence in that reply of Satan, without revolving to the
   truth and faithfulness of God, was plain unbelief. Now, as faith is the
   root of all righteousness and obedience, so is infidelity of all
   disobedience. Being overtaken, conquered, deceived into infidelity, man
   gave up himself to act contrary to God and his will, shook off his
   sovereignty, rose up against his law, and manifested the frame of his
   heart in the pledge of his disobedience, eating the fruit that was
   sacramentally forbidden him.

   Fourthly. That all men sinned in Adam, and that his sin is imputed to
   all his posterity, is by them denied, but is easily evinced; for, --

   1. By whom sin entered into the world, so that all sinned in him, and
   are made sinners thereby, so that also his sin is called the "sin of
   the world," in him all mankind sinned, and his sin is imputed to them:
   but that this was the condition and state of the first sin of Adam the
   scriptures before mentioned, in answer to our seventh question, do
   abundantly manifest; and thence also is his sin called "the sin of the
   world," John i. 29.

   2. In whom all are dead, and in whom they have contracted the guilt of
   death and condemnation, in him they have all sinned, and have his sin
   imputed to them: but in Adam all are dead, 1 Cor. xv. 22, as also Rom.
   v. 12, 15, 17-19; and death is the wages of sin only, chap. vi. 23.

   3. As by the obedience of Christ we are made righteous, so by the
   disobedience of Adam we are made sinners: so the apostle expressly,
   Romans 5: but we are made righteous by the obedience of Christ, by the
   imputation of it to us, as if we had performed it, 1 Cor. i. 30, Phil.
   iii. 9; therefore we are sinners by the imputation of the sin of Adam
   to us, as though we had committed it, which the apostle also affirms.
   To what hath been spoken from the consideration of that state and
   condition wherein, by God's appointment, in reference to all mankind,
   Adam was placed, namely, of a natural and political or federal head (of
   which the apostle treats, 1 Cor. xv.), and from the loss of that image
   wherein he was created, whereunto by Christ we are renewed, many more
   words like these might be added.

   To what hath been spoken there is no need that much should be added,
   for the removal of any thing insisted on to the same purpose with Mr
   B.'s intimations in the Racovian Catechism; but yet seeing that that
   task also is undertaken, that which may seem necessary for the
   discharging of what may thence be expected shall briefly be submitted
   to the reader. To this head they speak in the first chapter, of the way
   to salvation, the first question whereof is of the import ensuing:--

   Q. Seeing thou saidst in the beginning that this life which leadeth to
   immortality is divinely revealed, I would know of thee why thou saidst
   so?

   A. Because as man by nature hath nothing to do with immortality (or
   hath no interest in it), so by himself he could by no means know the
   way which leadeth to immortality. [248]

   Both question and answer being sophistical and ambiguous, the sense and
   intendment of them, as to their application to the matter in hand, and
   by them aimed at, is first to be rectified by some few distinctions,
   and then the whole will cost us very little farther trouble:--

   1. There is, or hath been, a twofold way to a blessed immortality:--
   (1.) The way of perfect obedience to the law; for he that did it was to
   live therein. (2.) The way of faith in the blood of the Son of God; for
   he that believeth shall be saved.

   2. Man by nature may be considered two ways:-- (1.) As he was in his
   created condition, not tainted, corrupted, weakened, nor lost by sin;
   (2.) As fallen, dead, polluted, and guilty.

   3. Immortality is taken either, (1.) Nakedly and purely in itself for
   an eternal abiding of that which is said to be immortal; or, (2.) For a
   blessed condition and state in that abiding and continuance.

   4. That expression, "By nature," referring to man in his created
   condition, not fallen by sin, may be taken two ways, either, -- (1.)
   Strictly, for the consequences of the natural principles whereof man
   was constituted; or, (2.) More largely, it comprises God's constitution
   and appointment concerning man in that estate.

   On these considerations it will be easy to take off this head of our
   catechists' discourse, whereby also the remaining trunk will fall to
   the ground.

   I say, then, man by nature, in his primitive condition, was, by the
   appointment and constitution of God, immortal as to the continuance of
   his life, and knew the way of perfect legal obedience, tending to a
   blessed immortality, and that by himself, or by virtue of the law of
   his creation, which was concreated with him; but fallen man, in his
   natural condition, being dead spiritually, obnoxious to death temporal
   and eternal, doth by no means know himself, nor can know, the way of
   faith in Jesus Christ, leading to a blessed immortality and glory, Rom.
   ii. 7-10.

   It is not, then, our want of interest in immortality upon the account
   whereof we know not of ourselves the way to immortality by the blood of
   Christ. But there are two other reasons that enforce the truth of it:--

   1. Because it is a way of mere grace and mercy, hidden from all
   eternity in the treasures of God's infinite wisdom and sovereign will,
   which he neither prepared for man in his created condition nor had man
   any need of; nor is it in the least discovered by any of the works of
   God, nor by the law written in the heart, but is solely revealed from
   the bosom of the Father by the only-begotten Son, neither angels nor
   men being able to discover the least glimpse of that majesty without
   that revelation, John i. 18; 1 Cor. ii. 7; Eph. iii. 8-11; Col. ii. 2,
   3; 1 Tim. iii. 16.

   2. Because man in his fallen condition, though there be retained in his
   heart some weak and faint impressions of good and evil, reward and
   punishment, Rom. ii. 14, 15, yet is spiritually dead, blind, alienated
   from God, ignorant, dark, stubborn; so far from being able of himself
   to find out the way of grace unto a blessed immortality, that he is not
   able, upon the revelation of it, savingly, and to the great end of its
   proposal, to receive, apprehend, believe, and walk in it, without a new
   spiritual creation, resurrection from the dead, or new birth, wrought
   by the exceeding greatness of the power of God. [249] And on these two
   doth depend our disability to discover and know the way of grace
   leading to life and glory. And by this brief removal of the covering is
   the weakness and nakedness of their whole ensuing discourse so
   discovered as that I shall speedily take it with its offence out of the
   way. They proceed:--

   Q. But why hath man nothing to do with (or no interest in) immortality?

   A. Therefore, because from the beginning he was formed of the ground,
   and so was created mortal; and then because he transgressed the command
   given him of God, and so by the decree of God, expressed in his
   command, was necessarily subject to eternal death. [250]

   1. It is true, man was created of the dust of the earth as to his
   bodily substance; yet it is as true that moreover God breathed into him
   the breath of life, whereby he became "a living soul," and in that
   immediate constitution and framing from the hand of God was free from
   all nextly disposing causes unto dissolution. But his immortality we
   place on another account, as hath been declared, which is no way
   prejudiced by his being made of the ground.

   2. The second reason belongs unto man only as having sinned, and being
   fallen out of that condition and covenant wherein he was created. So
   that I shall need only to let the reader know that the eternal death,
   in the judgment of our catechists, whereunto man was subjected by sin,
   was only an eternal dissolution or annihilation (or rather an abode
   under dissolution, dissolution itself being not penal), and not any
   abiding punishment, as will afterward be farther manifest, They go
   on:--

   Q. But how doth this agree with those places of Scripture wherein it is
   written that man was created in the image of God, and created unto
   immortality, and that death entered into the world by sin, Gen. i. 26;
   Wisd. ii. 23; Rom. v. 12?

   A. As to the testimony which declareth that man was created in the
   image of God, it is to be known that the image of God doth not signify
   immortality (which is evident from hence, because at that time when man
   was subject to eternal death the Scripture acknowledgeth in him that
   image, Gen. ix. 6, James iii. 9), but it denoteth the power and
   dominion over all things made of God on the earth, as the same place
   where this image is treated of clearly showeth, Gen. i. 26. [251]

   The argument for that state and condition wherein we affirm man to have
   been created from the consideration of the image of God wherein he was
   made, and whereunto in part we are renewed, was formerly insisted on.
   Let the reader look back unto it, and he will quickly discern how
   little is here offered to enervate it in the least; for, --

   1. They cannot prove that man, in the condition and state of sin, doth
   retain any thing of the image of God. The places mentioned, as Gen. ix.
   6, and James iii. 9, testify only that he was made in the image of God
   at first, but that he doth still retain the image they intimate not;
   nor is the inference used in the places taken from what man is, but
   what he was created.

   2. That the image of God did not consist in any one excellency hath
   been above declared; so that the argument to prove that it did not
   consist in immortality, because it did consist in the dominion over the
   creatures, is no better than that would be which should conclude that
   the sun did not give light because it gives heat, So that, --

   3. Though the image of God, as to the main of it, in reference to the
   end of everlasting communion with God whereunto we were created, was
   utterly lost by sin (or else we could not be renewed unto it again by
   Jesus Christ), yet as to some footsteps of it, in reference to our
   fellow-creatures, so much might be and was retained as to be a reason
   one towards another for our preservation from wrong and violence.

   4. That place of Gen. i. 26, "Let us make man in our image, and let him
   have dominion over the fish of the sea," etc., is so far from proving
   that the image of God wherein man was created did consist only in the
   dominion mentioned, that it doth not prove that dominion to have been
   any part of or to belong unto that image. It is rather a grant made to
   them who were made in the image of God than a description of that image
   wherein they were made.

   It is evident, then, notwithstanding any thing here excepted to the
   contrary, that the immortality pleaded for belonged to the image of
   God, and from man's being created therein is rightly inferred; as above
   was made more evident.

   Upon the testimony of the Book of Wisdom, it being confessedly
   apocryphal, I shall not insist. Neither do I think that in the original
   any new argument to that before mentioned of the image of God is added;
   but that is evidently pressed, and the nature of the image of God
   somewhat explained. The words are, Hoti ho Theos ektise ton anthroton
   ep aphtharsia kai eikona tes idias idiotetos epoiesen auton Phthono de
   diabolou thanatos eiselthen eis ton kosmon periazousi de auton hoi tes
   ekeinou meridos ontes. The opposition that is put between the creation
   of man in integrity and the image of God in one verse, and the entrance
   of sin by the envy of the devil in the next, plainly evinces that the
   mind of the author of that book was, that man, by reason of his being
   created in the image of God, was immortal in his primitive condition.
   That which follows is of another nature, concerning which they thus
   inquire and answer:--

   Q. What, moreover, wilt thou answer to the third testimony?

   A. The apostle in that place treateth not of immortality [mortality],
   but of death itself. But mortality differeth much from death, for a man
   may be mortal and yet never die. [252]

   But, -- 1. The apostle eminently treats of man's becoming obnoxious to
   death, which until he was, he was immortal; for he says that death
   entered the world by sin, and passed on all men, not actually, but in
   the guilt of it and obnoxiousness to it. By what means death entered
   into the world, or had a right so to do, by that means man lost the
   immortality which before he had.

   2. It is true, a man may be mortal as to state and condition, and yet
   by almighty power be preserved and delivered from actual dying, as it
   was with Enoch and Elijah; but in an ordinary course he that is mortal
   must die, and is directly obnoxious to death. But that which we plead
   for from those words of the apostle is, that man, by God's constitution
   and appointment, was so immortal as not to be liable or obnoxious to
   death until he sinned. But they will prove their assertion in their
   progress.

   Q. What, therefore, is the sense of these words, "that death entered
   into the world by sin?"

   A. This, that Adam for sin, by the decree and sentence of God, was
   subject to eternal death; and therefore all men, because (or inasmuch
   as) they are bern of him, are subject to the same eternal death. And
   that this is so, the comparison of Christ with Adam, which the apostle
   instituteth from verse 12 to the end of the chapter, doth declare.
   [253]

   1. Be it so that this is the meaning of those words; yet hence it
   inevitably follows that man was no way liable or obnoxious to death but
   upon the account of the commination of God annexed to the law he gave
   him. And this is the whole of what we affirm, -- namely, that by God's
   appointment man was immortal, and the tenure of his immortality was his
   obedience, and thereupon his right thereunto he lost by his
   transgression.

   2. This is farther evident from the comparison between Christ and Adam,
   instituted by the apostle; for as we are all dead without Christ and
   his righteousness, and have not the least right to life or a blessed
   immortality, so antecedently to the consideration of Adam and his
   disobedience, we were not in the least obnoxious unto death, or any way
   liable to it in our primitive condition.

   And this is all that our catechists have to plead for themselves, or to
   except against our arguments and testimonies to the cause in hand;
   which how weak it is in itself, and how short it comes of reaching to
   the strength we insist on, a little comparison of it with what went
   before will satisfy the pious reader.

   What remains of that chapter, consisting in the depravation of two or
   three texts of Scripture to another purpose than that in hand, I shall
   not divert to the consideration of, seeing it will more orderly fall
   under debate in another place.

   What our catechists add elsewhere about original sin, or their attempt
   to disprove it, being considered, shall give a close to this discourse.

   Their 10th chapter is, "De liboro arbitrio;" where, after, in answer to
   the first question proposed, they have asserted that it is in our power
   to yield obedience unto God, as having free will in our creation so to
   do, and having by no way or means lost that liberty or power, their
   second question is, --

   Q. Is not this free will corrupted by original sin?

   A. There is no such thing as original sin, wherefore that cannot
   vitiate free will, nor can that original sin be proved out of the
   Scripture; and the fall of Adam, being but one act, could not have that
   force as to corrupt his own nature, much less that of his posterity.
   And that it was inflicted on him as a punishment neither doth the
   Scripture teach, and it is incredible that God, who is the fountain of
   all goodness, would so do. [254]

   1. This is yet plain dealing; and it is well that men who know neither
   God nor themselves have yet so much honesty left as to speak downright
   what they intend. Quickly despatched! -- "There is no such thing as
   original sin." To us, the denying of it is one argument to prove it.
   Were not men blind and dead in sin, they could not but be sensible of
   it; but men swimming with the water feel not the strength of the
   stream.

   2. But doth the Scripture teach no such thing? Doth it nowhere teach
   that we, who were "created upright, in the image of God, are now dead
   in trespasses and sins, by nature children of wrath, having the wrath
   of God upon us, being blind in our understandings, and alienated from
   the life of God, not able to receive the things that are of God, which
   are spiritually discerned, our carnal minds being enmity to God, not
   subject to his law, nor can be; that our hearts are stony, our
   affections sensual; that we are wholly come short of the glory of God;
   that every figment of our heart is evil, so that we can neither think,
   nor speak, nor do that which is spiritually good or acceptable to God;
   that being born of the flesh, we are flesh, and unless we are born
   again, can by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven; that all this
   is come upon us by the sin of one man, whence also judgment passed on
   all men to condemnation?" Can nothing of all this be proved from the
   Scripture? These gentlemen know that we contend not about words or
   expressions. Let them grant this hereditary corruption of our nature,
   alienation from God, impotency to good, deadness and obstinacy in sin,
   want of the Spirit, image, and grace of God, with obnoxiousness thereon
   to eternal condemnation, and give us a fitter expression to declare
   this state and condition by in respect of every one's personal interest
   therein, and we will, so it may please them, call it "original sin" no
   more.

   3. It is not impossible that one act should be so high and intense in
   its kind as to induce a habit into the subject, and so Adam's nature be
   vitiated by it; and he begot a son in his own likeness. The devils upon
   one sin became obstinate in all the wickedness that their nature is
   capable of. (2.) This one act was a breach of covenant with God, upon
   the tenor and observation whereof depended the enjoyment of all that
   strength and rectitude with God wherewith, by the law of his creation,
   man was endued. (3.) All man's covenant good, for that eternal end to
   which he was created, depended upon his conformity to God, his
   subjection to him, and dependence on him; all which, by that one sin,
   he wilfully cast away for himself and posterity (whose common, natural,
   and federal head he was), and righteously fell into that condition
   which we have described. (4.) The apostle is much of a different mind
   from our catechists, Rom. v. 15, 16, etc., as hath been declared.

   4. What is credible concerning God and his goodness with these
   gentlemen I know not. To me, that is not only in itself credible which
   he hath revealed concerning himself, but of necessity to be believed.
   That he gave man a law, threatening him, and all his posterity in him
   and with him, with eternal death upon the breach of it; that upon that
   sin he cast all mankind judicially out of covenant, imputing that sin
   unto them all unto the guilt of condemnation, seeing it is "his
   judgment that they who commit sin are worthy of death;" and that "he is
   of purer eyes than to behold evil," -- is to us credible, yea, as was
   said, of necessity to be believed. But they will answer the proofs that
   are produced from Scripture in the asserting of this original sin.

   Q. But that there is original sin these testimonies seem to prove: Gen.
   vi. 5, "Every cogitation of the heart of man is only evil every day;"
   and Gen. viii. 21, "The cogitation of man's heart is evil from his
   youth?"

   A. These testimonies deal concerning voluntary sin; from them,
   therefore, original sin cannot be proved. As for the first, Moses
   showeth it to be such a sin for whose sake God repented him that he had
   made man, and decreed to destroy him with a flood; which certainly can
   by no means be affirmed concerning a sin which should be in man by
   nature, such as they think original sin to be. In the other, he showeth
   that the sin of man shall not have that efficacy that God should punish
   the world for it with a flood; which by no means agreeth to original
   sin. [255]

   That this attempt of our catechists is most vain and frivolous will
   quickly appear; for, -- 1. Suppose original sin be not asserted in
   those places, doth it follow there is no original sin? Do they not know
   that we affirm it to be revealed in the way of salvation, and proved by
   a hundred places besides? And do they think to overthrow it by their
   exception against two or three of them, when if it be taught in any one
   of them it suffices? 2. The words, as by them rendered, lose much of
   the efficacy for the confirmation of what they oppose which in the
   original they have. In the first place, it is not, "Every thought of
   man's heart," but, "Every imagination or figment of the thoughts of his
   heart." The "motus primo primi," the very natural frame and temper of
   the heart of man, as to its first motions towards good or evil, are
   doubtless expressed in these words. So also is it in the latter place.

   We say, then, that original sin is taught and proved in these places;
   not singly or exclusively to actual sins, not a parte ante, or from the
   causes of it, but from its effects. That such a frame of heart is so
   universally by nature in all mankind, and in every individual of them,
   as that it is ever, always, or continually, casting, coining, and
   devising evil, and that only, without the intermixture of any thing of
   another kind that is truly and spiritually good, is taught in these
   places; and this is original sin. Nor is this disproved by our
   catechists; for, --

   1. "Because the sin spoken of is voluntary, therefore it is not
   original," will not be granted. (1.) Original sin, as it is taken
   peccatum originans, was voluntary in Adam; and as it is originatum in
   us is in our wills habitually, and not against them, in any actings of
   it or them. (2.) The effects of it, in the coining of sin and in the
   thoughts of men's hearts, are all voluntary; which are here mentioned
   to demonstrate and manifest that root from whence they spring, that
   prevailing principle and predominant habit from whence they so
   uniformly proceed.

   2. Why it doth not agree to original sin that the account [is]
   mentioned, verse 6, of God's repenting that he had made man, and his
   resolution to destroy him, these gentlemen offer not one word of reason
   to manifest. We say, -- (1.) That it can agree to no other but this
   original sin, with its infallible effects, wherein all mankind were
   equally concerned, and so became equally liable to the last judgment of
   God; though some, from the same principle, had acted much more boldly
   against his holy Majesty than others. (2.) Its being in men by nature
   doth not at all lessen its guilt. It is not in their nature as created,
   nor in them so by nature, but is by the fall of Adam come upon the
   nature of all men, dwelling in the person of every one; which lesseneth
   not its guilt, but manifests its advantage for provocation.

   3. Why the latter testimony is not applicable to original sin they
   inform us not. The words joined with it are an expression of that
   patience and forbearance which God resolved and promised to exercise
   towards the world, with a non obstante for sin. Now, what sin should
   this be but that which is "the sin of the world"? That actual sins are
   excluded we say not; but that original sin is expressed and aggravated
   by the effects of it our catechists cannot disprove. There are many
   considerations of these texts, from whence the argument from them for
   the proof of that corruption of nature which we call original sin might
   be much improved; but that is not my present business, our catechists
   administering no occasion to such a discourse. But they take some other
   texts into consideration:--

   Q. What thinkest thou of that which David speaks, Ps. li. 7, "Behold, I
   shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me?"

   A. It is to be observed that David doth not here speak of any men but
   himself alone, nor that simply, but with respect to his fall, and uses
   that form of speaking which you have in him again, Ps. lviii. 3.
   Wherefore original sin cannot be evinced by this testimony. [256]

   But, -- 1. Though David speaks of himself, yet he speaks of himself in
   respect of that which was common to himself with all mankind, being a
   child of wrath as well as others; nor can these gentlemen intimate any
   thing of sin and iniquity, in the conception and birth of David, that
   was not common to all others with him. Any man's confession for himself
   of a particular guilt in a common sin doth not free others from it;
   yea, it proves all others to be partakers in it who share in that
   condition wherein he contracted the guilt.

   2. Though David mentions this by occasion of his fall, as having his
   conscience made tender and awakened to search into the root of his sin
   and transgression thereby, yet it was no part of his fall, nor Was he
   the less conceived in sin and forth in brought ever more or iniquity
   for that fall; which were ridiculous to imagine. He here acknowledges
   it upon the occasion of his fall, which was a fruit of the sin
   wherewith he was born, James i. 14, 15, but was equally guilty of it
   before his fall and after.

   3. The expression here used, and that of Ps. lviii. 3, "The wicked are
   estranged from the womb, they go astray as soon as they be born,
   speaking lies," exceedingly differ. Here, David expresses what was his
   infection in the womb; there, what is wicked men's constant practice
   from the womb. In himself, he mentions the root of all actual sin; in
   them, the constant fruit that springs from that root in unregenerate
   men. So that, by the favour of these catechists, I yet say that David
   doth here acknowledge a sin of nature, a sin wherewith he was defiled
   from his conception, and polluted when he was warmed, and so fomented
   in his mother's womb; and therefore this place doth prove original sin.

   One place more they call to an account, in these words:--

   Q. But Paul saith that "in Adam all sinned," Rom. v. 12.

   A. It is not in that place, "In Adam all sinned;" but in the Greek the
   words are eph ho, which interpreters do frequently render in Latin in
   quo, "in whom," which yet may be rendered by the particles quoniam or
   quatenus, "because," or "inasmuch," as in like places, Rom. viii. 3,
   Phil. iii. 12, Heb. ii. 18, 2 Cor. v. 4. It appeareth, therefore, that
   neither can original sin be built up out of this place. [257]

   1. Stop these men from this shifting hole, and you may with much ease
   entangle and catch them twenty times a day: "This word may be rendered
   otherwise, for it is so in another place," -- a course of procedure
   that leaves nothing certain in the book of God. 2. In two of the places
   cited, the words are not eph' ho, but en ho, Rom. viii. 3, Heb. ii. 18.
   3. The places are none of them parallel to this; for here, the apostle
   speaks of persons or a person in an immediate precedency; in them, of
   things. 4. But render eph' ho by quoniam, "because," or "for that," as
   our English translation doth, the argument is no less evident for
   original sin than if they were rendered by "in whom." In the beginning
   of the verse the apostle tells us that death entered the world by the
   sin of one man, -- that one man of whom he is speaking, namely, Adam,
   -- and passed upon all men: of which dispensation, that death passed on
   all men, he gives you the reason in these words, "For that all have
   sinned;" that is, in that sin of that one man whereby death entered on
   the world and passed on them all. I wonder how our catechists could
   once imagine that this exception against the translation of those words
   should enervate the argument from the text for the proof of all men's
   guilt of the first sin, seeing the conviction of it is no less evident
   from the words if rendered according to their desire.

   And this is the sum of what they have to offer for the acquitment of
   themselves from the guilt and stain of original sin, and for answer to
   the three testimonies on its behalf which themselves chose to call
   forth; upon the strength whereof they so confidently reject it at the
   entrance of their discourse, and in the following question triumph upon
   it, as a thing utterly discarded from the thoughts of their
   catechumens. What reason or ground they have for their confidence the
   reader will judge. In the meantime, it is sufficiently known that they
   have touched very little of the strength of our cause, nor once
   mentioned the testimonies and arguments on whose evidence and strength
   in this business we rely. And for themselves who write and teach these
   things, I should much admire their happiness, did I not so much as I do
   pity them in their pride and distemper, keeping them from an
   acquaintance with their own miserable condition.

  Examination.

   The aim and design of our catechist in this chapter being to despoil
   our blessed Lord Jesus Christ of his eternal deity, and to substitute
   an imaginary Godhead, made and feigned in the vain hearts of himself
   and his masters, into the room thereof, I hope the discovery of the
   wickedness and vanity of his attempt will not be unacceptable to them
   who love him in sincerity. I must still desire the reader not to expect
   the handling of the doctrine of the deity of Christ at large, with the
   confirmation of it and vindication from the vain sophisms wherewith by
   others, as well as by Mr B., it hath been opposed. This is done
   abundantly by other hands. In the next chapter that also will have its
   proper place, in the vindication of many texts of Scripture from the
   exceptions of the Racovians. The removal of Mr B.'s sophistry, and the
   disentangling of weaker souls, who may in any thing be intricated by
   his queries, are my present intendment. To make our way dear and plain,
   that every one that runs may read the vanity of Mr B.'s undertaking
   against the Lord Jesus, and his kicking against the pricks therein, I
   desire to premise these few observations:--

   1. Distinction of persons (it being an infinite substance) doth no way
   prove difference of essence between the Father and the Son. Where
   Christ, as mediator, is said to be another from the Father or God,
   spoken personally of the Father, it argues not in the least that he is
   not partaker of the same nature with him. That in one essence there can
   be but one person may be true where the substance is finite and
   limited, but hath no place in that which is infinite.

   2. Distinction and inequality in respect of office in Christ doth not
   in the least take away equality and sameness with the Father in respect
   of nature and essence. [258] A son of the same nature with his father,
   and therein equal to him, may in office be his inferior, his subject.

   3. The advancement and exaltation of Christ as mediator to any dignity
   whatever, upon or in reference to the work of our redemption and
   salvation, is not at all inconsistent with that essential axia, honour,
   dignity, and worth, which he hath in himself as "God blessed for ever."
   Though he humbled himself and was exalted, yet in nature he was one and
   the same, he changed not.

   4. The Scripture's asserting the humanity of Christ with the
   concernments thereof, as his birth, life, and death, doth no more
   thereby deny his deity, than, by asserting his deity, with the
   essential properties thereof, eternity, omniscience, and the like, it
   denies his humanity.

   5. God's working any thing in and by Christ, as he was mediator,
   denotes the Father's sovereign appointment of the things mentioned to
   be done, not his immediate efficiency in the doing of the things
   themselves.

   The consideration of these few things, being added to what I have said
   before in general about the way of dealing with our adversaries in
   these great and weighty things of the knowledge of God, will easily
   deliver us from any great trouble in the examination of Mr B.'s
   arguments and insinuations against the deity of Christ; which is the
   business of the present chapter.

   His first question is, "How many Lords of Christians are there, by way
   of distinction from that one God?" and he answers, Eph. iv. 5, "One
   Lord."

   That of these two words there is not one that looks towards the
   confirmation of what Mr B. chiefly aims at in the question proposed,
   is, I presume, sufficiently clear in the light of the thing itself
   inquired after. Christ, it is true, is the one Lord of Christians; and
   therefore God, equal with the Father. He is also one Lord in
   distinction from his Father, as his Father, in respect of his
   personality, in which regard them are three that bear record in heaven,
   of which he is one; but in respect of essence and nature "he and his
   Father are one." Farther; unless he were one God with his Father, it is
   utterly impossible he should be the one Lord of Christians. That he
   cannot be our Lord in the sense intended, whom we ought to invocate and
   worship, unless also he were our God, shall be afterward declared. And
   although he be our Lord in distinction from his Father, as he is also
   our mediator, yet he is "the same God" with him "which worketh all in
   all," 1 Cor. xii. 6. His being Lord, then, distinctly in respect of his
   mediation hinders not his being God in respect of his participation in
   the same nature with his Father. And though here he be not spoken of in
   respect of his absolute, sovereign lordship, but of his lordship over
   the church, to whom the whole church is spiritually subject (as he is
   elsewhere also so called on the same account, as John xiii. 13; Acts
   vii. 59; Rev. xxii. 20), yet were he not Lord in that sense also, he
   could not be so in this. The Lord our God only is to be worshipped. "My
   Lord and my God," says Thomas. And the mention of "one God" is here, as
   in other places, partly to deprive all false gods of their pretended
   deity, partly to witness against the impossibility of polytheism, and
   partly to manifest the oneness of them who are worshipped as God the
   Father, Word, and Spirit: all which things are also severally testified
   unto.

   His second question is an inquiry after this Lord, who he is, in these
   words, "Who is that one Lord?" and the answer is from 1 Cor. viii. 6,
   "Jesus Christ, by whom are all things." The close of this second answer
   might have caused Mr B. a little to recoil upon his insinuation in the
   first, concerning the distinction of this "one Lord" from that "one
   God," in the sense by him insisted on. Who is he "by whom are all
   things" (in the same sense as they are said to be "of" the Father)? who
   is that but God? "He that made all things is God," Heb. iii. 4. And it
   is manifest that he himself was not made by whom all things were made:
   for he made not himself, nor could so do, unless he were both before
   and aider himself; nor was he made without his own concurrence by
   another, for by himself are all things. Thus Mr B. hath no sooner
   opened his mouth to speak against the Lord Jesus Christ, but, by the
   just judgment of God, he stops it himself with a testimony of God
   against himself, which he shall never be able to rise up against unto
   eternity.

   And it is a manifest perverting and corrupting of the text which we
   have in Grotius' gloss upon the place, who interprets the ta panta
   referred to the Father of all things simply, but the ta panta referred
   to Christ of the things only of the new creation, [259] there being not
   the least colour for any such variation, the frame and structure of the
   words requiring them to be expounded uniformly throughout: "But to us
   there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him;
   and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him." "The
   last expression, And we by him,' relates to the new creation; All
   things,' to the first." But Grotius follows Enjedinus in this as well
   as other things. [260]

   His inquiry in the next place is after the birth of Jesus Christ; in
   answer whereunto the story is reported from Matthew and Luke: which
   relating to his human nature, and no otherwise to the person of the Son
   of God but as he was therein "made flesh," or assumed the "holy thing"
   so born of the Virgin, Luke i. 35, into personal subsistence with
   himself, I shall let pass with annexing unto it the observation before
   mentioned, namely, that what is affirmed of the human nature of Christ
   doth not at all prejudice that nature of his in respect whereof he is
   said to be "in the beginning with God," and to be "God," and with
   reference whereunto himself said, "Before Abraham was I am," John i. 1,
   2, viii. 58; Prov. viii. 22, etc. God "possessed him in the beginning
   of his way," being then his "only-begotten Son, full of grace and
   truth." Mr B. indeed hath small hopes of despoiling Christ of his
   eternal glory by his queries, if they spend themselves in such
   fruitless sophistry as this:-- "Q. 4. How came Jesus Christ to be Lord
   according to the opinion of the apostle Paul?" The answer is, Rom. xiv.
   9. "Q. 5. What saith the apostle Peter also concerning the time and
   manner of his being made Lord? -- A. Acts ii. 32, 33, 36."

   Ans. 1. That Jesus Christ as mediator, and in respect of the work of
   redemption and salvation of the church to him committed, was made Lord
   by the appointment, authority, and designation of his Father, we do not
   say was the opinion of Paul, but is such a divine truth as we have the
   plentiful testimony of the Holy Ghost unto. He was no less made a Lord
   than a Priest and Prophet, of his Father. But that the eternal lordship
   of Christ, as he is one with his Father, "God blessed for ever," Rom.
   ix. 5, is any way denied by the asserting of this lordship given him of
   his Father as mediator, Mr B. wholly begs of men to apprehend and
   grant, but doth not once attempt from the Scripture to manifest or
   prove. The sum of what Mr B. intends to argue hence is: Christ
   "submitting himself to the form and work of a servant unto the Father,
   was exalted by him, and had a name given him above every name;'
   therefore he was not the Son of God and equal to him." That his
   condescension unto office is inconsistent with his divine essence is
   yet to be proved. But may we not beg of our catechist, at his leisure,
   to look a little farther into the chapter from whence he takes his
   first testimony concerning the exaltation of Christ to be Lord? perhaps
   it may be worth his while. As another argument to that of the dominion
   and lordship of Christ, to persuade believers to a mutual forbearance
   as to judging of one another, he adds, verse 10, "We shall all stand
   before the judgment-seat of Christ." And this, verse 11, the apostle
   proves from that testimony of the prophet Isaiah, chap. xlv. 23, as he
   renders the sense of the Holy Ghost, "As I live, saith the Lord, every
   knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God." So that
   Jesus Christ our Lord is that Jehovah, that God, to whom all subjection
   is due, and in particular that of standing before his judgment-seat.
   But this is overlooked by Grotius, and not answered to any purpose by
   Enjedinus, and why should Mr B. trouble himself with it?

   2. For the time assigned by him of his being made Lord, specified by
   the apostle, it doth not denote his first investiture with that office
   and power, but the solemn admission into the glorious execution of that
   lordly power which was given him as mediator. At his incarnation and
   birth, God affirms by the angel that he was then "Christ the Lord,"
   Luke ii. 11. And when "he brought his first-begotten into the world,
   the angels were commanded to worship him;" which if he were not a Lord,
   I suppose Mr B. will not say they could have done. Yea, and as he was
   both believed in and worshipped before his death and resurrection, John
   ix. 38, xiv. 1, which is to be performed only to the Lord our God,
   Matt. iv. 10, so he actually in some measure exercised his lordship
   towards and over angels, men, devils, and the residue of the creation,
   as is known from the very story of the Gospel, not denying himself to
   be a king, yea, witnessing thereunto when he was to be put to death,
   Luke xxiii. 3, John xviii. 37, as he was from his first showing unto
   men, chap. i. 49.

   "Q. 6. Did not Jesus Christ approve himself to be God by his miracles;
   and did he not those miracles by a divine nature of his own, and
   because he was God himself? What is the determination of the apostle
   Peter in this behalf? -- A. Acts ii. 22, x. 38."

   The intendment of Mr B. in this question, as is evident by his
   inserting of these words in a different character, "By a divine nature
   of his own, and because he was God himself," is to disprove or
   insinuate an answer unto the argument taken from the miracles that
   Christ did to confirm his deity. The naked working of miracles, I
   confess, without the influence of such other considerations as this
   argument is attended withal in relation to Jesus Christ, will not alone
   of itself assert a divine nature in him who is the instrument of their
   working or production. Though they are from divine power, or they are
   not miracles, yet it is not necessary that he by whom they are wrought
   should be possessor of that divine power, as "by whom" may denote the
   instrumental and not the principal cause of them. But for the miracles
   wrought by Jesus Christ, as God is said to do them "by him," because he
   appointed him to do them, as he designed him to his offices, and
   thereby gave testimony to the truth of the doctrine he preached from
   his bosom as also because he was "with him," not in respect of power
   and virtue, but as the Father in the Son, John x. 38; so he working
   these miracles by his own power and at his own will, even as his Father
   doth, chap. v. 21, and himself giving power and authority to others to
   work miracles by his strength and in his name, Matt. x. 8, Mark xvi.
   17, 18, Luke x. 19, there is that eminent evidence of his deity in his
   working of miracles as Mr B. can by no means darken or obscure by
   pointing to that which is of a clear consistency therewithal, -- as is
   his Father's appointment of him to do them, whereby he is said to do
   them "in his name," etc., as in the place cited, of which afterward.
   Acts ii. 22, the intendment of Peter is, to prove that he was the
   Messiah of whom he spake; and therefore he calls him "Jesus of
   Nazareth," as pointing out the man whom they knew by that name, and
   whom, seven or eight weeks before, they had crucified and rejected.
   That this man was "approved of God," [261] he convinces them from the
   miracles which God wrought by him; which was enough for his present
   purpose. Of the other place there is another reason; for though Grotius
   expounds these words, Hoti ho Theos en met autou, "For God was with
   him," "God always loved him, and always heard him, according to Matt.
   iii. 17" (where yet there is a peculiar testimony given to the divine
   sonship of Jesus Christ) "and John xi. 42," yet the words of our
   Saviour himself about the same business give us another interpretation
   and sense of them. This, I say, he does, John x. 37, 38, "If I do not
   the works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, though ye believe
   not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the
   Father is in me, and I in him." In the doing of these works, the Father
   was so with him as that he was in him, and he in the Father; not only
   energetikos, but by that divine indwelling which oneness of nature
   gives to Father and Son.

   His seventh question is exceeding implicate and involved: a great deal
   is expressed that Mr B. would deny, but by what inference from the
   scriptures he produceth doth not at all appear. The words of it are,
   "Could not Christ do all things of himself; and was it not an eternal
   Son of God that took flesh upon him, and to whom the human nature of
   Christ was personally united, that wrought all these works? Answer me
   to these things in the words of the Son himself. -- A. John v. 19, 20,
   30, xiv. 10."

   The inference which alone appears from hence is of the same nature with
   them that are gone before. That Christ could not do all things of
   himself, that he was not the eternal Son of God, that he took not
   flesh, is that which is asserted; but the proof of all this doth
   disappear. Christ being accused by the Jews, and persecuted for healing
   a man on the Sabbath-day, and their rage being increased by his
   asserting his equality with the Father (of which afterward), John v.
   17, 18, he lets them know that in the discharge of the office committed
   to him he did nothing but according to the will, commandment, and
   appointment, of his Father, with whom he is equal, and doth of his own
   will also the things that he doth; so that they had no more to plead
   against him for doing what he did than they had against him whom they
   acknowledged to be God: wherein he is so far from declining the
   assertion of his own deity (which that he maintained the Jews
   apprehended, affirming that he made himself equal with God, which none
   but God is or can be, for between God and that which is not God there
   is no proportion, much less equality) as that he farther confirms it,
   by affirming that he "doeth whatever the Father doeth, and that as the
   Father quickeneth whom he will, so he quickeneth whom he will." That
   redoubled assertion, then, of Christ, that he can do nothing of
   himself, is to be applied to the matter under consideration. He had not
   done, nor could do, any work but such as his Father did also; it was
   impossible he should, not only because he would not (in which sense to
   abouleton is one kind of those things which are impossible), but also
   because of the oneness in will, nature, and power, of himself and his
   Father, which he asserts in many particulars. Nor doth he temper his
   speech as one that would ascribe all the honour to the Father, and so
   remove the charge that he made a man equal to the Father, as Grotius
   vainly imagines; [262] for although as man he acknowledges his
   subjection to the Father, yea, as mediator in the work he had in hand,
   and his subordination to him as the Son, receiving all things from him
   by divine and eternal communication, yet the action or work that gave
   occasion to that discourse being an action of his person, wherein he
   was God, he all along asserts his own equality therein with the Father,
   as shall afterward be more fully manifested.

   So that though in regard of his divine personality as the Son he hath
   all things from the Father, being begotten by him, and as mediator doth
   all things by his appointment and in his name, yet he in himself is
   still one with the Father as to nature and essence, "God to be blessed
   for evermore." And that it was "an eternal Son of God that took flesh
   upon him," etc., hath Mr B. never read that "in the beginning was the
   Word, and the Word was God," that "the Word was made flesh;" that "God
   was manifested in the flesh;" and that "God sent forth his Son, made of
   a woman, made under the law?" of which places afterward, in their
   vindication from the exceptions of his masters.

   His eighth question is of the very same import with that going before,
   attempting to exclude Jesus Christ from the unity of essence with his
   Father, by his obedience to him, and his Father's acceptation of him in
   the work of mediation; which being a most ridiculous begging of the
   thing in question, as to what he pretends in the query to be
   argumentative, I shall not farther insist upon it.

   Q. 9. We are come to the head of this discourse, and of Mr B.'s design
   in this chapter, and, indeed, of the greatest design that he drives in
   religion, namely, the denial of the eternal deity of the Son of God;
   which not only in this place directly, but in sundry others covertly,
   he doth invade and oppose. His question is, "Doth the Scripture account
   Christ to be the Son of God because he was eternally begotten out of
   the divine essence, or for other reasons agreeing to him only as a man?
   Rehearse the passages to this purpose." His answer is from Luke i.
   31-35; John x. 36; Acts xiii. 32, 33; Rev. i. 5; Col. i. 18; Heb. i. 4,
   5, v. 5; Rom. viii. 29; most of which places are expressly contrary to
   him in his design, as the progress of our discourse will discover.

   This, I say, being the head of the difference between us in this
   chapter, after I have rectified one mistake in Mr B.'s question, I
   shall state the whole matter so as to obviate farther labour and
   trouble about sundry other ensuing queries. For Mr B.'s question, then,
   we say not that the Son is begotten eternally out of the divine
   essence, but in it, not by an eternal act of the Divine Being, but of
   the person of the Father; which being premised, I shall proceed.

   The question that lies before us is, "Doth the Scripture account Christ
   to be the Son of God because he was eternally begotten out of the
   divine essence, or for other reasons agreeing to him only as a man?
   Rehearse the passages to this purpose."

   The reasons, as far as I can gather, which Mr B. lays at the bottom of
   this appellation, are, -- 1. His birth of the Virgin, from Luke i.
   30-35. 2. His mission, or sending into the world by the Father, John x.
   36. 3. His resurrection with power, Acts xiii. 32, 33; Rev. i. 5; Col.
   i. 18. 4. His exaltation, Heb. v. 5; Rom. viii. 29.

   For the removal of all this from prejudicing the eternal sonship of
   Jesus Christ there is an abundant sufficiency, arising from the
   consideration of this one argument: If Jesus Christ be called the "Son
   of God" antecedently to his incarnation, mission, resurrection, and
   exaltation, then there is a reason and cause of that appellation before
   and above all these considerations, and it cannot be on any of these
   accounts that he is called the "Son of God;" but that he is so called
   antecedently to all these, I shall afterward abundantly manifest. Yet a
   little farther process in this business, as to the particulars
   intimated, may not be unseasonable.

   First, then, I shall propose the causes on the account whereof alone
   these men affirm that Jesus Christ is called the "Son of God." Of these
   the first and chiefest they insist upon is his birth of the Virgin, --
   namely, that he was called the "Son of God" because he was conceived of
   the Holy Ghost. This our catechist in the first place proposes; and
   before him, his masters. So the Racovians, in answer to that question,
   "Is therefore the Lord Jesus a mere man?" answer, "By no means: for he
   was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin; and therefore from
   his birth and conception was the Son of God, as we read in Luke i. 35;"
   [263] -- the place insisted on by the gentleman we are dealing withal.

   Of the same mind are the residue of their companions. So do Ostorodius
   and Voidovius give an account of their faith in their "Compendium," as
   they call it, "of the Doctrine of the Christian Church flourishing now
   chiefly in Poland." "They teach," say they, "Jesus Christ to be that
   man that was conceived of the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin;
   besides and before whom they acknowledge no only-begotten Son of God
   truly existing. Moreover, they teach him to be God, and the
   only-begotten Son of God, by reason of his conception of the Holy
   Ghost," etc. [264] Smalcius hath written a whole book of the true
   divinity of Jesus Christ; wherein he hath gathered together whatever
   excellencies they will allow to be ascribed unto him, making his deity
   to be the exurgency of them all. Therefore is he God, and the Son of
   God, because the things he there treats of are ascribed unto him! Among
   these, in his third chapter, which is "Of the conception and nativity
   of Jesus Christ," he gives this principal account why he is called the
   "Son of God," even from his conception and nativity. "He was," saith
   he, "conceived of the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary; because
   of which manner of conception and nativity he was by the angel called
   the Son of God,' and so may really be called the natural Son of God,'
   because he was born such. Only, Jesus Christ was brought forth to light
   by God his Father without the help of man." [265]

   The great master of the herd himself, from whom, indeed, the rest do
   glean and gather almost all that they take so much pains to scatter
   about the world, gives continually this reason of Christ's being called
   the "Son of God" and his "natural Son." "I say," saith he, "that Christ
   is deservedly called the natural Son of God,' because he was born the
   Son of God, although he was not begotten of the substance of God. And
   that he was born the Son of God another way, and not by the generation
   of the substance of God, the words of the angel prove, Luke i. 35.
   Therefore, because that man, Jesus of Nazareth, who is called Christ,
   was begotten not by the help of any man, but by the operation of the
   Holy Spirit in the womb of his mother, he is therefore, or for that
   cause, called the Son of God.'?" [266] So he against Weik the Jesuit.
   He is followed by Volkelius, lib. v. cap. xi. p. 468; whose book,
   indeed, is a mere casting into a kind of a method what was written by
   Socinus and others, scattered in sundry particulars, and whose method
   is pursued and improved by Episcopius. Jonas Schlichtingius, amongst
   them all, seems to do most of himself. I shall therefore add his
   testimony, to show their consent in the assignation of this cause of
   the appellation of the "Son of God," ascribed to our blessed Saviour.
   "There are," saith he, "many sayings of Scripture which show that
   Christ is in a peculiar manner, and on an account not common to any
   other, the Son of God; but yet we may not hence conclude that he is a
   Son on a natural account, when besides this, and that more common,
   another reason may be given which hath place in Christ. Is he not the
   Son of God on a singular account, and that which is common to no other,
   if of God himself, by the virtue and efficacy of the Holy Spirit, he
   was conceived and begotten in the womb of his mother?" [267]

   And this is the only buckler which they have to keep off the sword of
   that argument for the deity of Christ, from his being the proper Son of
   God, from the throat and heart of that cause which they have
   undertaken. And yet how faintly they hold it is evident from the
   expressions of this most cunning and skillful of all their champions:
   "There may another reason be given, which is the general evasion of
   them all from any express testimony of Scripture. "The words may have
   another sense, therefore nothing from them can be concluded;" whereby
   they have left nothing stable or unshaken in Christian religion; and
   yet they wipe their mouths, and say they have done no evil.

   But now, lest any one should say that they can see no reason why Christ
   should be called the "Son of God" because he was so conceived by the
   Holy Ghost, nor wherefore God should therefore in a peculiar manner,
   and more eminently than in respect of any other, be called the "Father
   of Christ," to prevent any objection that on this hand might arise,
   Smalcius gives an account whence this is, and why God is called the
   "Father of Christ," and what he did in his conception; which, for the
   abomination of it, I had rather you should hear in his words than in
   mine. In his answer to the second part of the refutation of Socinus by
   Smiglecius, cap. xvii., xviii., he contends to manifest and make good
   that Christ was the "Son of God according to the flesh," in direct
   opposition to that of the apostle, "He was made of the seed of David
   according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God," etc., Rom.
   i. 3, 4. He says then, cap. 18, p. 156, "Socinus affirmat Deum in
   generatione Christi vices patris supplevisse." But how, I pray? Why,
   "Satis est ad ostendendum, Deum in generatione Christi vices viri
   supplevisse, si ostendatur Deum id ad Christi generationem adjecisse,
   quod in generatione hominis ex parte viri ad hominem producendum adjici
   solet." But what is that, or how is that done? "Nos Dei virtutem in
   Virginis uterum aliquam substantiam creatam vel immisisse, aut ibi
   creasse affirmamus, ex qua juncto eo, quod ex ipsius Virginis
   substantia accessit, verus homo generatus fuit. Alias enim homo ille,
   Dei Filius a conceptione et nativitate proprie non fuisset," cap. xvii.
   p. 150. Very good; unless this abominable figment may pass current,
   Christ was not the Son of God. Let the reader observe, by the way, that
   they cannot but acknowledge Christ to have been, and to have been
   called, the "Son of God" in a most peculiar manner. To avoid the
   evidence of the inference from thence, that therefore he is God, of the
   same substance with his Father, they have only this shift, to say he is
   called the "Son of God' upon the account of that whereof there is not
   the least tittle nor word in the whole book of God, yea, which is
   expressly contrary to the testimony thereof; and unless this be
   granted, they affirm that Christ cannot be called the "Son of God." But
   let us hear this great rabbi of Mr B.'s religion a little farther
   clearing up this mystery:-- "Necessitas magna fuit, ut Christus ab
   initio vitæ suæ esset Deo Filius, qualis futurus non fuisset nisi Dei
   virtute aliquid creatum fuisset, quod ad constituendum Christi corpus,
   una cum Mariæ sanguine concurrit. Mansit autem nihilominus sanguis
   Mariæ Virginis purissimus, etiamsi cum alio aliquo semine commixtus
   fuit. Potuit enim tam purum, imo porius semen, a Deo creari, et
   proculdubio creatum fuit, quam erat sanguis Mariæ. Communis denique
   sensus et fides Christianorum omnium, quod Christus non ex virili
   semine conceptus sit; primum communis error censendus est, si sacris
   literis repuguet: Deinde id quod omnes sentiunt, facile cum ipsa
   veritate conciliari potest, ut scilicet semen illud, quod a Deo
   creatum, et cum semine Mariæ conjuncture fuit, dicatur non virile, quia
   non a viro profectum sit, vel ex viro in uterum Virginis translatum, ut
   quidam opinantur, qui semen Josephi translatum in Virginis uterum
   credunt," cap. xviii., p. 158. And thus far are men arrived: Unless
   this horrible figment may be admitted, Christ is not the Son of God. He
   who is the "true God and eternal life" will one day plead the cause of
   his own glory against these men.

   I insist somewhat the more on these things, that men may judge the
   better whether in all probability Mr B., in his "impartial search into
   the Scripture," did not use the help of some of them that went before
   him in the discovery of the same things which he boasts himself to have
   found out.

   And this is the first reason which our catechist hath taken from his
   masters to communicate to his scholars why Jesus Christ is called the
   "Son of God." This he and they insist on exclusively to his eternal
   sonship, or being the Son of God in respect of his eternal generation
   of the substance of his Father.

   The other causes which they assign why he is called the "Son of God" I
   shall very briefly point unto. By the way that hath been spoken of,
   they say he was the Son of God, the natural Son of God. But they say he
   was the Son of God before he was God. He grew afterward to be a God by
   degrees, as he had those graces and excellencies and that power given
   him wherein his Godhead doth consist. So that he was the Son of God,
   but not God (in their own sense) until a while after; and then when he
   was so made a God, he came thereby to be more the Son of God. But by
   this addition to his sonship he became the adopted Son of God; as, by
   being begotten, as was before revealed, he was the natural Son of God.
   Let us hear Smalcius a little opening these mysteries. "Neither," saith
   he, "was Christ God all the while he was the Son of God. To be the Son
   of God is referred to his birth, and all understand how one may be
   called the "Son of God" for his birth or original. But God none can be
   (besides that one God), but for his likeness to God. So that when
   Christ was made like God, by the divine qualities which were in him, he
   was most rightly so far the Son of God as he was God, and so far God as
   he was the Son of God. But before he had obtained that likeness to God,
   properly he could not be said to be God." [268]

   And these are some of those monstrous figments which, under pretence of
   bare adherence to the Scripture, our catechist would obtrude upon us:
   First, Christ is the Son of God; then, growing like God in divine
   qualities, he is made a God; and so becomes the Son of God. And this,
   if the man may be believed, is the pure doctrine of the Scripture! And
   if Christ be a God because he is like God, by the same reason we are
   all gods in Mr B.'s conceit, being all made in the image and likeness
   of God; which, says he, by sin we have not lost.

   But what kind of sonship is added to Christ by all these excellencies
   whereby he is made like to God? The same author tells us that it is a
   sonship by adoption, and that Christ on these accounts was the adopted
   Son of God. "If," saith he, "what is the signification of this word
   adoptivus may be considered from the Scripture, we deny not but that
   Christ in this manner may be called the adopted Son of God,' seeing
   that such is the property and condition of an adopted son that he is
   not born such as he is afterward made by adoption. Certainly, seeing
   that Christ was not such by nature, or in his conception and nativity,
   as he was afterward in his succeeding age, he may justly on that
   account be called the adopted Son of God.'?" [269] Such miserable
   plunges doth Satan drive men into whose eyes he hath once blinded, that
   the glorious light of the gospel should not shine into them! And by
   this we may understand, whatever they add farther concerning the
   sonship of Christ, that all belongs to this adopted sonship; whereof
   there is not one tittle in the whole book of God.

   The reasons they commonly add why in this sense Christ is called the
   "Son of God" are the same which they give why he is called "God." "He
   is the only-begotten Son of God," say the authors of the Compendium of
   the religion before mentioned, "because God sanctified him, and sent
   him into the world, and because of his exaltation at the right hand of
   God, whereby he was made our Lord and God." [270]

   Their good friend Episcopius hath ordered all their causes of Christ's
   filiation under four heads:--

   1. The first way (saith he) whereby Christ is in the Scripture kat'
   exochen, called the "Son of God," is in that as man he was conceived of
   the Holy Ghost, and born of a virgin. And I doubt not (saith he) but
   that God is on this ground called eminently the "Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ."

   2. Jesus Christ by reason of that duty or office which was imposed on
   him by his Father, that he should be the king of Israel promised by the
   prophets, is called the "Son of God."

   3. Because he was raised up by the Father to an immortal life, and, as
   it were, born again from the womb of the earth without the help of any
   mother.

   4. Because being so raised from death, he is made complete heir of hie
   Father's house, and lord of all his heavenly goods, saints, and angels.
   [271]

   The like he had written before, in his Apology for the Remonstrants,
   cap. ii. sect. 2.

   Thus he, evidently and plainly from the persons before named. But yet,
   after all this, he asks another question, -- "Whether, all this being
   granted, there do not yet moreover remain a more eminent and peculiar
   reason why Christ is called the Son of God'?" He answers himself:
   "There is, -- namely, his eternal generation of the Father, his being
   God of God from all eternity;" which he pursues with sundry arguments,
   and yet in the close disputes that the acknowledgment of this truth is
   not fundamental, or the denial of it exclusive of salvation! [272] So
   this great reconciler of the Arminian and Socinian religions, whose
   composition and unity into an opposition to them whom he calls
   Calvinists is the great design of his Theological Institutions; and
   such at this day is the aim of Curcellæus and some others. By the way,
   I shall desire (before I answer what he offers to confirm his
   assignation of this fourfold manner of filiation to Jesus Christ) to
   ask this learned gentleman (or those of his mind who do survive him)
   this one question, Seeing that Jesus Christ was from eternity the Son
   of God, and is called so after his incarnation, and was on that account
   in his whole person the Son of God, by their own confessions, what
   tittle can he or they find in the Scripture of a manifold filiation of
   Jesus Christ in respect of God his Father? or whether it be not a
   diminution of his glory to be called the Son of God upon any lower
   account, as by a new addition to him who was eternally his
   only-begotten Son, by virtue of his eternal generation of his own
   substance.

   Having thus discovered the mind of them with whom we have to do, and
   from whom our catechist hath borrowed his discoveries, I shall briefly
   do these two [three?] things:-- I. Show that the filiation of Christ
   consists in his generation of the substance of his Father from
   eternity, or that he is the Son of God upon the account of his divine
   nature and subsistence therein, antecedent to his incarnation. II. That
   it consists solely therein, and that he was not, nor was called, the
   Son of God upon any other account but that mentioned; and therein
   answer what by Mr B. or others is objected to the contrary. III. To
   which I shall add testimonies and arguments for the deity of Christ, --
   whose opposition is the main business of that new religion which Mr B.
   would catechise poor unstable souls into, -- in the vindication of
   those excepted against by the Racovians.

   I. For the demonstration of the first assertion, I shall insist on some
   few of the testimonies and arguments that might be produced for the
   same purpose:--

   1. He who is the true, proper, only-begotten Son of God, of the living
   God, he is begotten of the essence of God his Father, and is his Son by
   virtue of that generation; but Jesus Christ was thus the only, true,
   proper, only-begotten Son of God: and therefore he is the Son of God
   upon the account before mentioned. That Jesus Christ is the Son of God
   in the manner expressed, the Scripture abundantly testifieth: "Lo a
   voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased," Matt. iii. 17; "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
   God," chap. xvi. 16, John vi. 69.

   Which [latter] place in Matthew is the rather remarkable, because it is
   the confession of the faith of the apostles, given in answer to that
   question, "Whom say ye that I the Son of man am?" They answer, "The Son
   of the living God;" and this in opposition to them who said he was "a
   prophet, or as one of the prophets," as Mark expresses it, chap. vi.
   15, -- that is, only so. And the whole confession manifests that they
   did in it acknowledge both his orifice of being the Mediator and his
   divine nature or person also. "Thou art the Christ." These words
   comprise all the causes of filiation insisted on by them with whom we
   have to do, and the whole office of the mediation of Christ; but yet
   hereunto they add, "The Son of the living God," expressing his divine
   nature, and sonship on that account.

   "And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
   understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him
   that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and
   eternal life," 1 John v. 20. "He spared not his own Son," Rom. viii.
   32. "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw his
   glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father," John i. 14.
   "No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in
   the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him," verse 18. "He said also
   that God was his Father, making himself equal with God," John v. 18.
   "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son," John iii.
   16. "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
   sent his only-begotten Son into the world," 1 John iv. 9. "Thou art my
   Son; this day have I begotten thee," Ps. ii. 7, etc. All which places
   will be afterward vindicated at large.

   To prove the inference laid down, I shall fix on one or two of these
   instances:--

   1. He who is idios huios, the "proper son" of any, is begotten of the
   substance of his father. Christ is the proper Son of God, and God he
   called often idion Patera, his "proper Father." He is properly a father
   who begets another of his substance; and he is properly a son who is so
   begotten.

   Grotius confesseth there is an emphasis in the word idios, whereby
   Christ is distinguished from that kind of sonship which the Jews laid
   claim unto. [273] Now, the sonship they laid claim unto and enjoyed, so
   many of them as were truly so, was by adoption; for "to them pertained
   the adoption," Rom. ix. 4. Wherein this emphasis, then, and specially
   of Christ's sonship, should consist, but in what we assert of his
   natural sonship, cannot be made to appear. Grotius says it is "because
   the Son of God was a name of the Messiah." True, but on what account?
   Not that common [one] of adoption, but this of nature, as shall
   afterward appear.

   Again; he who is properly a son is distinguished from him who is
   metaphorically so only; for any thing whatever is metaphorically said
   to be what it is said to be by a translation and likeness to that which
   is true. Now, if Christ be not begotten of the essence of his Father,
   he is only a metaphorical Son of God by way of allusion, and cannot be
   called the proper Son of God, being only one who hath but a similitude
   to a proper Son; so that it is a plain contradiction that Christ should
   be the proper Son of God, and yet not be begotten of his Father's
   essence. Besides, in that 8th of the Romans, the apostle had before
   mentioned other sons of God, who became so by adoption, verses 15, 16;
   but when he comes to speak of Christ in opposition to them, he calls
   him "God's own" or proper "Son," -- that is, his natural Son, they
   being so only by adoption. And in the very words themselves, the
   distance that is given him by way of eminence above all other things
   doth sufficiently evince in what sense he is called the "proper Son of
   God:" "He that spared not his own Son, how shall he not with him give
   us all things?"

   2. The only-begotten Son of God is his natural Son, begotten of his
   essence, and there is no other reason of this appellation. And this is
   farther clear from the antithesis of this "only-begotten' to "adopted."
   They are adopted sons who are received to be such by grace and favour.
   He is only-begotten who alone is begotten of the substance of his
   father; neither can any other reason be assigned why Christ should so
   constantly, in way of distinction from all others, be called the
   "only-begotten Son of God." It were even ridiculous to say that Christ
   were the only-begotten Son of God and his proper Son, if he were his
   Son only metaphorically and improperly. That Christ is the proper,
   only-begotten Son of God, improperly and metaphorically, is that which
   is asserted to evade these testimonies of Scripture. Add hereunto the
   emphatical, discriminating significancy of that voice from heaven,
   "This is he, that well-beloved Son of mine;" and that testimony which
   in the same manner Peter gave to this sonship of Christ in his
   confession, "Thou art the Son of the living God;" and the ground of
   Christ's filiation will be yet more evident. Why the Son of the living
   God, unless as begotten of God as the living God, as living things
   beget of their own substance? But of that place before. Christ, then,
   being the true, proper, beloved, only-begotten Son of the living God,
   is his natural Son, of his own substance and essence.

   3. The same truth may have farther evidence given unto it from the
   consideration of what kind of Son of God Jesus Christ is. He who is
   such a son as is equal to his father in essence and properties is a son
   begotten of the essence of his father. Nothing can give such an
   equality but a communication of essence. Then, with God, equality of
   essence can alone give equality of dignity and honour; for between that
   dignity, power, and honour, which belong to God as God, and that
   dignity or honour that is or may be given to any other, there is no
   proportion, much less equality, as shall be evidenced at large
   afterward. And this is the sole reason why a son is equal to his father
   in essence and properties, because he hath from him a communication of
   the same essence whereof he is partaker. Now, that Christ is such a Son
   as hath been mentioned, the Scripture abundantly testifies. "My
   Father," saith Christ, "worketh hitherto, and I work. Therefore the
   Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the
   Sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal
   with God," John v. 17, 18. Verse 17, having called God his Father in
   the particular manner before mentioned, and affirmed to himself an
   equal nature and power for operation with his Father, the Jews thence
   inferred that he testified of himself that he was such a Son of God as
   that he was equal with God.

   The full opening of this place at large is not my present business; the
   learned readers know where to find that done to their hand. The
   intendment of those words is plain and evident. Grotius expounds Ison
   heauton to Theo, by "It was lawful for him to do what was so to God,
   and that he was no more bound to the Sabbath than he; which," saith he,
   "was a gross calumny." [274] So verse 19, these words of our Saviour,
   "The Son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the Father do"
   (wherein the emphasis lies evidently in the words aph heautou, for the
   Son can do nothing of himself but what the Father doth, seeing he hath
   his essence, and so, consequently, will and power, communicated to him
   by the Father), he renders to be an allusion to and comparison between
   a master and scholar; [275] as the scholar looks diligently to what his
   master doth, and strives to imitate him, so was it with Christ and God;
   -- which exposition was the very same with that which the Arians
   assigned to this place, as Maldonate upon the place makes appear. That
   it was not an equal licence with the Father to work on the Sabbath, but
   an equality of essence, nature, and power between Father and Son, that
   the Jews concluded from the saying of Christ, is evident from this
   consideration, that there was no strength in that plea of our Saviour
   of working on the Sabbath-day because his Father did so, without the
   violation of the Sabbath, unless there had been an equality between the
   persons working. That the Jews did herein calumniate Christ or accuse
   him falsely, the Tritheists said, indeed, as Zanchius testifies; [276]
   and Socinus is of the same mind, whose interest Grotius chiefly serves
   in his Annotations: but the whole context and carriage of the business,
   with the whole reply of our Saviour, do abundantly manifest that the
   Jews, as to their conclusion, were in the right, that he made himself
   such a Son of God as was equal to him. For if in this conclusion they
   had been mistaken, and so had calumniated Christ, there be two grand
   causes why he should have delivered them from that mistake by
   expounding to them what manner of Son of God he was:-- First, Because
   of the just scandal they might take at what he had spoken, apprehending
   that to be the sense of his words which they professed. [277] Secondly,
   Because on that account they sought to slay him; which if they had
   done, he should by his death have borne witness to that which was not
   true. They sought to kill him because he made himself such a Son of God
   as by that sonship he was equal to God; which if it were not so, there
   was a necessity incumbent on him to have cleared himself of that
   aspersion, which yet he is so far from, as that in the following verses
   he farther confirms the same thing.

   So he "thought it not robbery to be equal with God," Phil. ii. 6. It is
   of God the Father that this is spoken, as the Father, as appears in the
   winding up of that discourse: Verse 11, "That every tongue should
   confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." And
   to him is Christ equal; and therefore begotten of his own essence.

   Yea, he is such a Son as is one with his Father: "I and my Father are
   one," John x. 30; which the Jews again instantly interpret, without the
   least reproof from him, that he being man did yet aver himself to be
   God, verse 33.

   This place also is attempted to be taken out of our hands by Grotius,
   though with no better success than the former. ho Pater hen esmen "He
   joineth what he had spoken with what went before," saith he: "If they
   cannot be taken from my Father's power, they cannot be taken from mine,
   for I have my power of my Father; so that it is all one to be kept of
   me as of my Father:" which he intends, as I suppose, to illustrate by
   the example of the power that Joseph had under Pharaoh, Gen. xli.,
   though the verse he intend be false printed. [278] But that it is an
   unity of essence and nature, as well as an alike prevalency of power,
   that our Saviour intends, [is evident,] not only from that apprehension
   which the Jews had concerning the sense of those words, who immediately
   took up stones to kill him for blasphemy (from which apprehension he
   doth not at all labour to free them), but also from the exposition of
   his mind in those words, which is given us in our Saviour's following
   discourse: for, verse 36, he tells us this is as much as if he had
   said, "I am the Son of God" (now, the unity between Father and Son is
   in essence and nature principally), and then that "he doeth the works
   of his Father," the same works that his Father doeth, verses 37, 38,
   which, were he not of the same nature with him, he could not do; which
   he closes with this, "That the Father is in him, and he in the Father,"
   verse 38: of which words before and afterward.

   He, then (that we may proceed), who is so the Son of God as that he is
   one with God, and therefore God, is the natural and eternal Son of God;
   but that such a Son is Jesus Christ is thus plentifully testified unto
   in the Scripture. But because I shall insist on sundry other places to
   prove the deity of Christ, which also all confirm the truth under
   demonstration, I shall here pass them by. The evidences of this truth
   from Scripture do so abound, that I shall but only mention some other
   heads of arguments that may be and are commonly insisted on to this
   purpose. Then, --

   4. He who is the Son of God, begotten of his Father by an eternal
   communication of his divine essence, he is the Son begotten of the
   essence of the Father; for these terms are the same, and of the same
   importance. But this is the description of Christ as to his sonship
   which the Holy Ghost gives us. Begotten he was of the Father, according
   to his own testimony: "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee,"
   Ps. ii. 7. And he is "the only-begotten Son of God," John iii. 18. And
   that he is so begotten by a communication of essence we have his own
   testimony: "Before the hills, was I brought forth," Prov. viii. 25. He
   was begotten and brought forth from eternity. And now he tells you
   farther, John v. 26, "The Father hath given to the Son to have life in
   himself." It was by the Father's communication of life unto him, and
   his living essence or substance; for the life that is in God differs
   not from his being. And all this from eternity: "The Lord possessed me
   in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from
   everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were
   no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding
   with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
   brought forth," etc., Prov. viii. 22, etc., to the end of verse 31.
   "But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, out of thee shall he come forth unto me
   that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of
   old, from everlasting," Mic. v. 2. "In the beginning was the Word,"
   John i. 1. "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with
   the glory which I had with thee before the world was," John xvii. 5.
   "And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the world, he
   saith," etc., Heb. i. 6, etc.

   5. The farther description which we have given us of this Son makes it
   yet more evident: "He is the brightness of his Father's glory, and the
   express image of his person," Heb. i. 3. "The image of the invisible
   God," Col. i. 15. That Christ is the essential image of his Father, and
   not an accidental image, an image so as no creature is or can be
   admitted into copartnership with him therein, shall be on another
   occasion in this treatise fully demonstrated. And thither the
   vindication of these texts from the gloss of Grotius is also remitted.

   And this may suffice (without insisting upon what more might be added)
   for the demonstration of the first assertion, That Christ's filiation
   ariseth from his eternal generation, or he is the Son of God upon the
   account of his being begotten of the essence of his Father from
   eternity.

   II. That he is and is termed the Son of God solely on this account, and
   not upon the reasons mentioned by Mr B. and explained from his
   companions, is with equal clearness evinced. Nay, I see not how any
   thing may seem necessary for this purpose to be added to what hath been
   spoken; but for the farther satisfaction of them who oppose themselves,
   the ensuing considerations, through the grace and patience of God, may
   be of use:--

   1. If, for the reasons and causes above insisted on from the Socinians,
   Christ be the Son of God, then Christ is the Son of God "according to
   the flesh," or according to his human nature. So he must needs be, if
   God be called his Father because he supplied the room of a father in
   his conception. But this is directly contrary to the scriptures calling
   him the Son of God in respect of his divine nature, in opposition to
   the flesh or his human nature: "Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our
   Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; and
   declared to be the Son of God with power," Rom. i. 3, 4. "Of whom as
   concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for
   ever," Rom. ix. 5. The same distinction and opposition is observed, 2
   Cor. xiii. 4, 1 Pet. iii. 18. If Jesus Christ according to the flesh be
   the Son of David, in contradistinction to the Son of God, then
   doubtless he is not called the Son of God according to the flesh; but
   this is the plain assertion of the Scripture in the places before
   named. Besides, on the same reason that Christ is the Son of man, on
   the same he is not the Son of God; but Christ was and was called the
   Son of man upon the account of his conception of the substance of his
   mother, and particularly the Son of David, and so is not on that
   account the Son of God.

   Farther; that place of Rom. i. 3, 4, passing not without some
   exceptions as to the sense insisted on, may be farther cleared and
   vindicated. Jesus Christ is called the Son of God: Verses 1, 3, "The
   gospel of God concerning his Son Jesus Christ." This Son is farther
   described, -- (1.) By his human nature: He was "made of the seed of
   David according to the flesh." (2.) In respect of his person or divine
   nature, wherein he was the "Son of God," and that en dunamei, "in
   power" or "existing in the power of God," for so dunamis put absolutely
   doth often signify: as Rom. i. 20; Matt. vi. 13, xxvi. 64; Luke iv. 36.
   He had, or was in, the omnipotency of God; and was this declared to be,
   not in respect of the flesh, in which he was "made of a woman," but
   kata Pneuma hagiosunes (which is opposed to kata sarka), "according
   to," or "in respect of, his divine holy Spirit;" as is also the
   intendment of that word "The Spirit," in the places above mentioned.
   Neither is it new that the deity of Christ should be called Pneuma
   hagiosunes himself is called qds qdsym?, Dan. ix. 24, Sanctitas
   Sanctitatum, as here Spiritus Sanctitatis. And all this, saith the
   apostle, was declared so to be, or Christ was declared to be thus the
   Son of God, in respect of his divine, holy, spiritual, being, which is
   opposed to the flesh, ex anastaseos nekron, "by the" (or his)
   "resurrection from the dead," whereby an eminent testimony was given
   unto his deity. He was "declared to be the Son of God" thereby,
   according to the sense insisted on.

   To weaken this interpretation, Grotius moves, as they say, every stone,
   and heaves at every word; but in vain. (1.) Horisthentos, he tells us,
   is as much as prooristhentos, as by the Vulgar Latin it is translated
   prædestinatus. So, he pleads, it was interpreted by many of the
   ancients. The places he quotes were most of them collected by Beza in
   his annotations on the place, who yet rejects their judgment therein,
   and cites others to the contrary. Luke xxii. 22, Acts x. 42, xvii. 31,
   are also urged by him to evince the sense of the word; in each of which
   places it may be rendered "declared," or "to declare," and in neither
   of them ought to be by "predestinated." Though the word may sometimes
   signify so (which is not proved), yet that it here doth so will not
   follow. Horos, a "definition" (from whence that word comes), declares
   what a thing is, makes it known; and horizo may best be rendered "to
   declare," Heb. iv. 7. So in this place. Ti houn estin horisthentos tou
   Theou deichthentos apophanthentos, says Chrysostom on the place. And so
   doth the subject-matter require, the apostle treating of the way
   whereby Christ was manifested eminently to be the Son of God.

   But the most learned man's exposition of this place is admirable.
   "Jesus," saith he, "is many ways said to be the Son of God.'?" This is
   begged in the beginning, because it will not be proved in the end. If
   this be granted, it matters not much what follows. "But most commonly,
   or most in a popular way, because he was raised unto a kingdom by God."
   Not once in the whole book of God! Let him, or any one for him, prove
   this by any one clear testimony from Scripture, and take his whole
   interpretation. The Son of God, as Mediator, was exalted to a kingdom,
   and made a Prince and Saviour: but that by that exaltation he was made
   the Son of God, or was so on that account, is yet to be proved; yea, it
   is most false. He goes on: "In that sense the words of the second Psalm
   were spoken of David, because he was exalted to a kingdom, which are
   applied to Christ, Acts xiii. 33; Heb. i. 5.' But it is not proved that
   these words do at all belong to David, so much as in the type, nor any
   of the words from verse 7 to the end of the psalm. If they are so to be
   accommodated, they belong to the manifestation, not constitution of
   him; and so they are applied to our Saviour, when they relate to his
   resurrection, as one who was thereby manifested to be the Son of God,
   according as God had spoken of him. But now how was Christ
   predestinated to this sonship? "This kingly dignity, or the dignity of
   a Son, of Jesus, was predestinated and prefigured, when, leading a
   mortal life, he wrought signs and wonders;' which is the sense of the
   words en dunamei." The first sense of the word horisthentos is here
   insensibly slipped from. Predestinated and prefigured are ill conjoined
   as words of a neighbouring significancy. To predestinate is constantly
   ascribed to God as an act of his fore-appointing things to their end;
   neither can this learned man give one instance from the Scripture of
   any other signification of the word. And how comes now horisthentos to
   be "prefigured"? Is there the least colour for such a sense?
   "Predestinated to be the Son of God with power;" that is, "The signs he
   wrought prefigured that he should be exalted to a kingdom." He was by
   them in a good towardliness for it. It is true, dunameis, and sometimes
   dunamis, being in construction with some transitive verb, doth signify
   "great" or "marvellous works;" but that en dunamei, spoken of one
   declared to be so, hath the same signification, is not proved. He adds,
   "These signs Jesus did by the Spirit of holiness;' that is, that divine
   efficacy wherewith he was sanctified from the beginning of his
   conception, Luke i. 35; Mark ii. 8; John ix. 36." In the two latter
   places there is not one word to the purpose in hand; perhaps he
   intended some other, and these are false printed. The first shall be
   afterward considered; how it belongs to what is here asserted I
   understand not. That Christ wrought miracles by the "efficacy of the
   grace of the Spirit," with which he was sanctified, is ridiculous. If
   by the "Spirit" is understood his "spiritual, divine nature," this
   whole interpretation falls to the ground. To make out the sense of the
   words, he proceeds, "Jesus therefore is showed to be noble on the
   mother's side, as coming of an earthly king; but more noble on his
   Father's part, being made a heavenly king of God, after his
   resurrection, Heb. v. 9; Acts ii. 30, xxvi. 23." [279] And thus is this
   most evident testimony of the deity of Christ eluded, or endeavoured to
   be so. Christ on the mother's side was the "son of David," -- that is,
   "according to the flesh," -- of the same nature with her and him. On
   the Father's side he was the "Son of God," of the same nature with him.
   That God was his Father, and he the Son of God, because "after his
   resurrection he was made a heavenly king," is a hellish figment,
   neither is there any one word or tittle in the texts cited to prove it;
   so that it is a marvel to what end they are mentioned, one of them
   expressly affirming that he was the Son of God before his resurrection,
   Heb. v. 8, 9.

   2. He who was actually the Son of God before his conception, nativity,
   endowment with power or exaltation, is not the Son of God on these
   accounts, but on that only which is antecedent to them. Now, by virtue
   of all the arguments and testimonies before cited, as also of all those
   that shall be produced for the proof and evincing of the eternal deity
   of the Son of God, the proposition is unmoveably established, and the
   inference evidently follows thereupon.

   But yet the proposition, as laid down, may admit of farther
   confirmation at present. It is, then, testified to, Prov. xxx. 4, "What
   is his name, and what is his Son's name, if thou canst tell?" He was,
   therefore, the Son of God, and he was incomprehensible, even then
   before his incarnation. Ps. ii. 7, "Thou art my Son; this day have I
   begotten thee." Isa. ix. 6, "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
   given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name
   shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
   Father, The Prince of Peace." He is a Son, as he is the everlasting
   Father. And to this head of testimonies belongs what we urged before
   from Prov. viii. 22, etc. "He is the image of the invisible God, the
   first-born of every creature," Col. i. 15, which surely as to his
   incarnation he was not. "Before Abraham was, I am," John viii. 58. But
   of these places, in the following chapter, I shall speak at large.

   3. Christ was so the Son of God that he that was made like him was to
   be without father, mother, or genealogy: Heb. vii. 3, "Without father,
   without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor
   end of life; but made like unto the Son of God." But now Christ, in
   respect of his conception and nativity, had a mother (and one, they
   say, that supplied the room of father), had a genealogy that is upon
   record, and beginning of life, etc; so that upon these accounts he was
   not the Son of God, but on that wherein he had none of all these
   things, in the want whereof Melchisedec was made like to him. I shall
   only add, --

   4. That which only manifests the filiation of Christ is not the cause
   of it. The cause of a thing is that which gives it its being. The
   manifestation of it is only that which declares it to be so. That all
   things insisted on as the causes of Christ's filiation, by them with
   whom we have to do, did only declare and manifest him so to be who was
   the Son of God, the Scripture witnesseth: "The Holy Ghost shall come
   upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee;
   therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be
   called the Son of God," Luke i. 35. He shall be called so, -- thereby
   declared to be so: "And great was the mystery of godliness: God was
   manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,
   preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
   glory," 1 Tim. iii. 16. All the causes of Christ's filiation assigned
   by our adversaries are evidently placed as manifestations of God in
   him, or of his being the Son of God: "Declared to be the Son of God
   with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection
   from the dead," Rom. i. 3, 4. The absurdity of assigning distinct and
   so far different causes of the same effect of filiation, whether you
   make them total or partial, need not be insisted on.

   Farther (to add one consideration more), says Socinus, "Christ was the
   Son of God upon the account of his holiness and righteousness, and
   therein his likeness to God." Now, this he had not, according to his
   principles, in his infancy. He proves Adam not to have been righteous
   in the state of innocency, because he had yielded actual obedience to
   no law: no more had Christ done in his infancy. Therefore, -- (1.) He
   was not the Son of God upon the account of his nativity; nor (2.) did
   he become the Son of God any otherwise than we do, namely, by heating
   the word, learning the mind, and doing the will of God. (3.) God did
   not give his only-begotten Son for us, but gave the son of Mary, that
   he might (by all that which we supposed he had done for us) be made the
   Son of God. And so (4.) this sending of Christ doth not so much commend
   the love of God to us as to him, that he sent him to die and rise that
   he might be made God and the Son of God. (5.) Neither can any eximious
   love of Christ to us be seen in what he did and suffered; for had he
   not clone and suffered what he did, he had not been the Son of God.
   (6.) And also, if Christ be, on the account of his excellencies,
   graces, and gifts, the Son of God (which is one way of his filiation,
   insisted on), -- and to be God and the Son of God is, as they say, all
   one, and as it is indeed, -- then all who are renewed into the image of
   God, and are thereby the sons of God (as are all believers), are gods
   also!

   And this that hath been spoken may suffice for the confirmation of the
   second assertion laid down at the entrance of this discourse.

   To the farther confirmation of this assertion two things are to be
   annexed:-- First, The eversion of that fancy of Episcopius before
   mentioned, and the rest of the Socinianising Arminians, that Christ is
   called the "Son of God," both on the account of his eternal sonship and
   also of those other particulars mentioned from him above. Secondly, To
   consider the texts of Scripture produced by Mr B. for the confirmation
   of his insinuation, that Christ is not called the "Son of God" because
   of his eternal generation of the essence of his Father. The first may
   easily be evinced by the ensuing arguments:--

   1. The question formerly proposed to Episcopius may be renewed; for if
   Christ be the Son of God partly upon the account of his eternal
   generation, and so he is God's proper and natural Son, and partly upon
   the other accounts mentioned, then, --

   (1.) He is partly God's natural Son, and partly his adopted Son; partly
   his eternal Son, partly a temporary Son; partly a begotten Son, partly
   a made Son; -- of which distinctions, in reference to Christ, there is
   not one iota in the whole book of God.

   (2.) He is made the Son of God by that which only manifests him to be
   the Son of God, as the things mentioned do.

   (3.) Christ is equivocally only, and not univocally, called the Son of
   God; for that which hath various and diverse causes of its being so is
   so equivocally. If the filiation of Christ hath such equivocal causes
   as eternal generation, actual incarnation, and exaltation, he hath an
   equivocal filiation; which whether it be consistent with the Scripture,
   which calls him the proper Son of God, needs no great pains to
   determine.

   2. The Scripture never conjoins these causes of Christ's filiation as
   Causes in and of the same kind, but expressly makes the one the sole
   constituting, and the rest causes manifesting only, as hath been
   declared. And, to shut up this discourse, if Christ be the Son of man
   only because he was conceived of the substance of his mother, he is the
   Son of God only upon the account of his being begotten of the substance
   of his Father.

   Secondly, There remaineth only the consideration of those texts of
   Scripture which Mr B. produceth to insinuate the filiation of Christ to
   depend on other causes, and not on his eternal generation of the
   essence of his Father; which, on the principles laid down and proved,
   will receive a quick and speedy despatch.

   1. The first place named by him, and universally insisted on by the
   whole tribe, is Luke i. 30-35. It is the last verse only that I suppose
   weight is laid upon. Though Mr B. names the others, his masters never
   do so. That of verses 31, 32 seems to deserve our notice in Mr B.'s
   judgment, who changes the character of the words of it, for their
   significancy to his purpose. The words are, "Thou shalt conceive in thy
   womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be
   great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest." What Mr B. supposes
   may be proved from hence, at least how he would prove what he aims at,
   I know not. That Jesus Christ, who was bern of the Virgin, was a son of
   the Highest we contend. On what account he was so the place mentioneth
   not; but the reason of it is plentifully manifested in other places, as
   hath been declared.

   The words of verse 35 are more generally managed by them: "The Holy
   Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
   overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
   thee shall be called the Son of God." But neither do these particles,
   dio kai, render a reason of Christ's filiation, nor are [they] a note
   of the consequent, but only of an inference or consequence that ensues
   from what he spake before: "It being so as I have spoken, even that
   holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
   There is weight also in that expression, Hagion to gennomenon, "That
   holy thing that shall be born of thee." Hagion is not spoken in the
   concrete, or as an adjective, but substantively, and points out the
   natural essence of Christ, whence he was "that holy thing." Besides, if
   this be the cause of Christ's filiation which is assigned, it must be
   demonstrated that Christ was on that account called the "Son of God,"
   for so hath it been said that he should be; but there is not any thing
   in the New Testament to give light that ever Christ was on this account
   called the "Son of God," nor can the adversaries produce any such
   instance.

   2. It is evident that the angel in these words acquaints the blessed
   Virgin that in and by her conception the prophecy of Isaiah should be
   accomplished, which you have, chap. vii. 14, "Behold, a virgin shall
   conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel," as the
   express words of Luke declare, being the same with those of the
   prophecy, "Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a
   son, and shalt call," etc., verses 31, 32. And Matt. i. 20, 21, this
   very thing being related, it is said expressly to be done according to
   what was foretold by the prophet, verses 22, 23, repeating the very
   words of the Holy Ghost by Isaiah, which are mentioned before. Now
   Isaiah foretelleth two things:-- (1.) That a virgin should conceive;
   (2.) That he that was so conceived should be Immanuel, God with us; or
   the Son of God, as Luke here expresses it. And this is that which the
   angel here acquaints the blessed Virgin withal upon her inquiry, verse
   34, even that, according to the prediction of Isaiah, she should
   conceive and bear a son, though a virgin, and that that son of her's
   should be called the "Son of God."

   By the way, Grotius' dealing with this text, both in his annotations on
   Isa. vii., as also in his large discourse on Matt. i. 21-23, is
   intolerable and full of offence to all that seriously weigh it. It is
   too large here to be insisted on. His main design is to prove that this
   is not spoken directly of Christ, but only applied to him by a certain
   general accommodation. God may give time and leisure farther to lay
   open the heap of abominations which are couched in those learned
   annotations throughout. Which also appears, --

   3. From the emphaticalness of the expression dio kai, "even also."
   "That holy thing which is to be born of thee, even that shall be called
   the Son of God, and not only that eternal Word that is to be incarnate.
   That hagion to gennomenon, being in itself anupostaton, shall be called
   the Son of God." "Shall be called so," that is, appear to be so, and be
   declared to be so with power. It is evident, then, that the cause of
   Christ's filiation is not here insisted on, but the consequence of the
   Virgin's conception declared; that which was "born of her should be
   called the Son of God."

   And this Socinus is so sensible of that he dares not say that Christ
   was completely the Son of God upon his conception and nativity; which,
   if the cause of his filiation were here expressed, he must be. "It is
   manifest," saith he, "that Christ before his resurrection was not fully
   and completely the Son of God, being not like God before in immortality
   and absolute rule." [280]

   Mr B.'s next place, whereby the sonship of Christ is placed on another
   account, as he supposes, is John x. 36, "Say ye of him, whom the Father
   hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I
   said, I am the Son of God?"

   That this scripture is called to remembrance not at all to Mr B.'s
   advantage will speedily appear; for, --

   1. Here is not in the words the least mention whence, or for what cause
   it is, that Christ is the Son of God, but only that he is so, he being
   expressed and spoken of under that description which is used of him
   twenty times in that Gospel, "He who is sent of the Father." This is
   all that is in this place asserted, that he whom the Father sanctified
   and sent into the world counted it no robbery to be equal with him, nor
   did blaspheme in calling himself his Son.

   2. It is evident that Christ in these words asserts himself to be such
   a Son of God as the Jews charged him with blasphemy for affirming of
   himself that he was; for he justifies himself against their accusation,
   not denying in the least that they rightly apprehended and understood
   him, but maintaining what he had spoken to be most true. Now, this was
   that which the Jews charged him withal, verse 33, "That he, being a
   man, blasphemed in making himself God;" for so they understood him,
   that in asserting his sonship he asserted also his deity. This Christ
   makes good, namely, that he is such a Son of God as is God also; yea,
   he makes good what he had said, verse 30, which was the foundation of
   all the following discourse about his blasphemy, "I and my Father are
   one." So that, --

   3. An invincible argument for the sonship of Christ, to be placed only
   upon the account of his eternal generation, ariseth from this very
   place that was produced to oppose it! He who is the Son of God because
   he is "one with the Father," and God equal to him, is the Son of God
   upon the account of his eternal relation to the Father: but that such
   was the condition of Jesus Christ, himself here bears witness to the
   Jews, although they are ready to stone him for it; and of his not
   blaspheming in this assertion he convinces his adversaries by an
   argument a minori, verses 34-36.

   A brief analysis of this place will give evidence to this
   interpretation of the words. Our Saviour Christ having given the reason
   why the Jews believed not on him, namely, "because they were not of his
   sheep," verse 26, describes thereupon both the nature of those sheep of
   his, verse 27, and their condition of safety, verse 28. This he farther
   confirms from the consideration of his Father's greatness and power,
   which is amplified by the comparison of it with others, who are all
   less than he, verse 29; as also from his own power and will, which
   appears to be sufficient for that end and purpose from his essential
   unity with his Father, verse 30. The effect of this discourse of Christ
   by accident is the Jews taking up of stones, which is amplified by
   this, that it was the second time they did so, and that to this
   purpose, that they might stone him, verse 31. Their folly and madness
   herein Christ disproves with an argument ab absurdo, telling them that
   it must be for some good work that they stoned him, for evil had he
   done none, verse 32. This the Jews attempt to disprove by a new
   argument a disparatis, telling him that it was "not for a good work,
   but for blasphemy," that he "made himself to be God," whom they would
   prove to be but a man, verse 33. This pretence of blasphemy Christ
   disproves, as I said before, by an argument a minori, verses 34-36, and
   with another from the effects or the works which he did, which
   sufficiently proved him to be God, verses 37, 38, still maintaining
   what he said and what they thought to be blasphemy; so that they
   attempt again to kill him, verse 39. It is evident, then, that he still
   maintained what they charged him with.

   4. And this answers that expression which is so frequent in the
   Scripture, of God's sending his Son into the world, and that he came
   down from heaven, and came into the world, Gal. iv. 4, John iii. 13;
   all evincing his being the Son of God antecedently to that mission or
   sanctification whereby in the world he was declared so to be.
   Otherwise, the Son of God was not sent, but one to be his Son.

   Acts xiii. 32, 33, is also insisted on: "We declare unto you glad
   tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath
   fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up
   Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my
   Son, this day have I begotten thee."

   1. He that can see in this text a cause assigned of the filiation of
   Christ that should relate to the resurrection, I confess is sharper
   sighted than I. This I know, that if Christ were made the Son of God by
   his resurrection from the dead, he was not the Son of God who died, for
   that preceded this his making to be the Son of God. But that God gave
   his only-begotten Son to die, that he spared not his only Son, but gave
   him up to death, I think is clear in Scripture, if any thing be so.

   2. Paul seems to interpret this place to me, when he informs us that
   "Christ was declared to be the Son of God with power, by the
   resurrection from the dead," Rom. i. 4. Not that he was made so, but he
   was "declared" or made known to be so, when, being "crucified through
   weakness, he lived by the power of God," 2 Cor. xiii. 4; which power
   also was his own, John x. 18.

   According as was before intimated, Grotius interprets these words,
   "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee," "I have made thee a
   king; which," he says, "was fulfilled in that, when all power was given
   him in heaven and earth, Matt. xxviii. 18; as Justin in his colloquy
   with Trypho: Tote genesin autou legon genesthai exotou he gnosis autou
   emelle genesthai." [281] (1.) But then he was the Son of God before his
   resurrection, for he was the Son of God by his being begotten of him:
   which as it is false, so contrary to his own gloss on Luke i. 35. (2.)
   Christ was a king before his resurrection, and owned himself so to be,
   as hath been showed. (3.) Justin's words are suited to our exposition
   of this place. He was said to be then begotten, because then he was
   made known to be so the Son of God. (4.) That these words are not
   applied to Christ, in their first sense, in respect of his
   resurrection, [is evident] from the pre-eminence assigned unto him
   above angels by virtue of this expression, Heb. i. 5, which he had
   before his death, chap. i. 6. Nor, (5.) Are the words here used to
   prove the resurrection, which is done in the verses following, out of
   Isaiah and another psalm, "And as concerning that he raised him up from
   the dead," etc., Acts xiii. 34, 35. But then, --

   3. It is not an interpretation of the meaning of that passage in the
   psalm which Paul, Acts xiii., insists on, but the proving that Christ
   was the Son of God, as in that psalm he was called, by his resurrection
   from the dead; which was the great manifesting cause of his deity in
   the world.

   What Mr B. intends by the next place mentioned by him I know not. It is
   Rev. i. 5, "And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the
   first begotten of the dead." That Christ was the first who was raised
   from the dead to a blessed and glorious immortality, and is thence
   called the first-begotten of them, or from the dead, and that all that
   rise to such an immortality rise after him, and by virtue of his
   resurrection, is most certain and granted; but that from thence he is
   that only-begotten Son of God, though thereby he was only "declared" so
   to be, there is not the least tittle in the text giving occasion to
   such an apprehension.

   And the same also is alarmed of the following place of Col. i. 18,
   where the same words are used again: "He is the head of the church, who
   is the beginning, prototokos ek ton nekron, -- the first-born of the
   dead." Only I shall desire our catechist to look at his leisure a
   little higher into the chapter, where he will find him called also
   prototokos pases ktiseos, "the first-born of all the creation;" so that
   he must surely be prototokos before his resurrection. Nay, he is so the
   first-born of every creature as to be none of them; [282] for by him
   they were all created, verse 16. He who is so before all creatures as
   to be none of them, but that they are all created by him, is "God
   Messed for ever:" which when our catechist disproves, he shall have me
   for one of his disciples.

   Of the same kind is that which Mr B. next urgeth from Heb. i. 4, 5,
   only it hath this farther disadvantage, that both the verses going
   immediately before and that immediately following after do inevitably
   evince that the constitutive cause of the sonship of Jesus Christ, a
   priori, is in his participation of the divine nature, and that it is
   only manifested by any ensuing consideration. Verses 2, 3, the Holy
   Ghost tells us that "by him God made the worlds, who is the brightness
   of his glory, and the express image of his person;" and this as the Son
   of God, antecedent to any exaltation as mediator. And verse 6, "He
   bringeth in the first-begotten into the world, and saith, Let all the
   angels of God worship him." He is the first-begotten before his
   bringing into the world; and that this is proved by the latter clause
   of the verse shall be afterward demonstrated. Between both these, much
   is not like to be spoken against the eternal sonship of Christ. Nor is
   the apostle only declaring his pre-eminence above the angels upon the
   account of that name of his, the "Son of God," which he is called upon
   record in the Old Testament, but the causes also of that appellation he
   had before declared.

   The last place urged to this purpose is of the same import. It is Heb.
   v. 5, "So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
   but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten
   thee." When Mr B. proves any thing more towards his purpose from this
   place, but only that Christ did not of his own accord undertake the
   office of a mediator, but was designed to it of God his Father, who
   said unto him, "Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee,"
   declaring him so to be with power after his resurrection, I shall
   acknowledge him to have better skill in disputing than as yet I am
   convinced he is possessed of.

   And thus have I cleared the eternal sonship of Jesus Christ, and
   evinced the vanity of attempting to fix his prerogative therein upon
   any other account, not doubting but that all who love him in sin,
   cerity will be zealous of his glory herein. For his growing up to be
   the Son of God by degrees, to be made a God in process of time, to be
   the adopted Son of God, to be the Son of God upon various accounts of
   diverse kinds, inconsistent with one another, to have had such a
   conception and generation as modesty forbids to think or express, not
   to have been the Son of God until after his death, and the like
   monstrous figments, I hope he will himself keep his own in an
   everlasting abhorring of.

   The farther confirmation of the deity of Christ, whereby Mr B.'s whole
   design will be obviated, and the vindication of the testimonies
   wherewith it is so confirmed from his masters, is the work designed for
   the next chapter.

   There are yet remaining of this chapter two or three questions looking
   the same way with those already considered, which will, upon the
   principles already laid down and insisted on, easily and in very few
   words be turned aside from prejudicing the eternal deity of the Son of
   God. His 10th, then, is, --

   "What saith the Son himself concerning the prerogative of God the
   Father above him?" and answer is given John xiv. 28; Mark xiii. 32;
   Matt. xxiv. 36: whereunto is subjoined another of the same, "What saith
   the apostle Paul? -- A. 1 Cor. xv. 24, 28, xi. 3, iii. 22, 23."

   The intendment of these questions being the application of what is
   spoken of Christ, either as mediator or as man, unto his person, to the
   exclusion of any other consideration, namely, that of a divine nature
   therein, the whole of Mr B.'s aim in them is sufficiently already
   disappointed. It is true, there is an order, yea, a subordination, in
   the persons of the Trinity themselves, whereby the son, as to his
   personality, may be said to depend on the Father, being begotten of
   him; but that is not the subordination here aimed at by Mr B., but that
   which he underwent by dispensation as mediator, or which attends him in
   respect of his human nature. All the difficulty that may arise from
   these kinds of attribution to Christ the apostle abundantly salves in
   the discovery of the rise and occasion of them, Phil. ii. 7-9. He who
   was in the form of God, and equal to him, was in the form of a servant,
   whereunto he humbled himself, his servant, and less than he. And there
   is no more difficulty in the questions wherewith Mr B. amuses himself
   and his disciples than there was in that wherewith our Saviour stopped
   the mouth of the Pharisees, -- namely, how Christ could be the son of
   David, and yet his Lord, whom he worshipped. For the places of
   Scripture in particular urged by Mr B., [such as] John xiv. 28, says
   our Saviour, "My Father is greater than I" (mittens misso, says Grotius
   himself, referring the words to office, not nature), which he was and
   is in respect of that work of mediation which he had undertaken; but
   "inæqualitas officii non tollit æqualitatem naturæ." [283] A king's son
   is of the same nature with his father, though he may be employed by him
   in an inferior office. He that was less than his Father as to the work
   of mediation, being the Father's servant therein, is equal to him as
   his Son, as God to be blessed for ever. Mark xiii. 32, Matt. xxiv. 36,
   affirm that the Father only knows the times and seasons mentioned, not
   the angels, nor the Son; and yet, notwithstanding, it was very truly
   said of Peter to Christ, "Lord, thou knowest all things," John xxi. 17.
   He that in and of the knowledge and wisdom which as man he had, and
   wherein he grew from his infancy, knew not that day, yet as he knew all
   things knew it; it was not hidden from him, being the day by him
   appointed. Let Mr B. acknowledge that his knowing all things proves him
   to be God, and we will not deny but his not knowing the day of judgment
   proves him to have another capacity, and to be truly man.

   As man he took on him those affections which we call phusika kai
   adiableta pathe amongst which, or consequently unto which, he might be
   ignorant of some things. [284] In the meantime, he who made all things,
   as Christ did, Heb. i. 2, knew their end as well as their beginning. He
   knew the Father, and the day by him appointed; yea, all things that the
   Father hath were his, and "in him were hid all the treasures of wisdom
   and knowledge," Col. ii. 3.

   Paul speaks to the same purpose, 1 Cor. xv. 24, 28. The kingdom that
   Christ doth now peculiarly exercise is his economical mediatory
   kingdom; which shall have an end put to it when the whole of his
   intendment in that work shall be fulfilled and accomplished. But that
   he is not also sharer with his Father in that universal monarchy which,
   as God by nature, he hath over all, this doth not at all prove. All the
   argument from this place is but this: "Christ shall cease to be
   mediator; therefore he is not God." And that no more is here intended
   is evident from the expression of it, "Then shall the Son himself be
   subject;" which if it intend any thing but the ceasing from the
   administration of the mediatory kingdom, wherein the human nature is a
   sharer, it would prove that, as Jesus Christ is mediator, he is not in
   subjection to his Father, which himself abundantly hath manifested to
   be otherwise. Of 1 Cor. xi. 3, and iii. 22, 23, there is the same
   reason, both speaking of Christ as mediator; whence that no testimony
   can be produced against his deity hath been declared.

   He adds, 12th, "Q. Howbeit, is not Christ dignified, as with the title
   of Lord, so also with that of God, in the Scripture? -- A. [John xx.
   28,] Thomas said, "My Lord and my God." Verily, if Thomas said that
   Christ was his God, and said true, Mr B. is to blame who denies him to
   be God at all. With this one blast of the Spirit of the Lord is his
   fine fabric of religion blown to the ground. And it may be supposed
   that Mr B. made mention of this portion of Scripture that he might have
   the honour of cutting his own throat and destroying his own cause; or
   rather, that God, in his righteous judgment, hath forced him to open
   his mouth to his own shame. Whatever be the cause of it, Mr B. is very
   far from escaping this sword of the Lord, either by his insinuation in
   the present query, or diversion in the following. For the present, it
   was not the intent of Thomas to dignify Christ with titles, but to make
   a plain confession of his faith, being called upon by Christ to
   believe. In this state he professes that he believes him to be his Lord
   and his God. Thomas doubtless was a Christian; and Mr B. tells us that
   Christians have but one God, chap. i., ques. 1, Eph. iv. 6. Jesus
   Christ, then, being the God of Thomas, he is the Christians' one God,
   if Mr B. may be believed. It is not, then, the dignifying of Christ
   with titles (which it is not for men to do), but the naked confession
   of a believer's faith, that in these words is expressed. Christ is the
   Lord and God of a believer; ergo the only true God, as 1 John v. 20. Mr
   B. perhaps will tell you he was made a God; so one abomination begets
   another, -- infidelity idolatry; -- of this afterward. But yet he was
   not, according to his companions, made a God before his ascension,
   which was not yet when Thomas made his solemn confession.

   Some attempt also is made upon this place by Grotius Kai ho Theos mou.
   "Here first," saith he, "in the story of the gospel, is this word found
   ascribed by the apostle unto Jesus Christ" (which Maldonate before him
   observed for another purpose), "to wit, after he had by his
   resurrection proved himself to be him from whom life, and that eternal,
   ought to be expected. And this custom abode in the church, as appears
   not only in the apostolical writings, Rom. ix. 5, and of the ancient
   Christians, as may be seen in Justin Martyr against Trypho, but in the
   Epistle also of Pliny unto Trajan, where he says that the Christians
   sang verses to Christ as to God;" [285] or, as the words are in the
   author, "Carmen Christo, quasi Deo, dicere secum invicem." What the
   intendment of this discourse is is evident to all those who are a
   little exercised in the writings of them whom our author all along in
   his Annotations takes care of. That Christ was now made a God at his
   resurrection, and is so called from the power wherewith he was
   Intrusted at his ascension, is the aim of this discourse. Hence he
   tells us it became a "custom" to call him God among the Christians,
   which also abode amongst them; and to prove this "custom" he wrests
   that of the apostle, Rom. ix. 5, where the deity of Christ is spoken
   of, in opposition to his human nature or his flesh, that he had of the
   Jews, plainly asserting a divine nature in him, calling him God
   subjectively, and not only by way of attribution. But this is, it
   seems, a "custom," taken up afar Christ's resurrection, to call him
   God, and so continued; though John testifies expressly that he was God
   in the beginning. It is true, indeed, much is not to be urged from the
   expressions of the apostles before the pouring out of the Spirit upon
   them, as to any eminent acquaintance with spiritual things; yet they
   had before made this solemn confession that Christ was the "Son of the
   living God," Matt. xvi. 16-18, which is to the full as much as what is
   here by Thomas expressed. That the primitive Christians worshipped
   Christ and invocated him not only as a god, but professing him to be
   "the true God and eternal life," we have better testimonies than that
   of a blind Pagan who knew nothing of them nor their ways, but by the
   report of apostates, as himself confesseth. But learned men must have
   leave to make known their readings and observations, whatever become of
   the simplicity of the Scripture.

   To escape the dint of this sword, Mr B. nextly queries: "Q. Was he so
   the God of Thomas as that he himself in the meantime did not
   acknowledge another to be his God? -- A. John xx. 17; Rev. iii. 12."

   True, he who, being partaker of the divine essence, in the form of God,
   was Thomas' God, as he was mediator, the head of his church,
   interceding for them, acknowledged his Father to be his God; yea, God
   may be said to be his God upon the account of his sonship and
   personality, in which regard he hath his deity of his Father, and as
   "God of God." Not that he is a secondary, lesser, made god, a hero,
   semideus, as Mr B. fancies him, but "God blessed for ever," in order of
   subsistence depending on the Father.

   Of the same nature is the last question, namely, "Have you any passage
   in the Scripture where Christ, at the same time that he hath the
   appellation of God given to him, is said to have a God? -- A. Heb. i.
   8, 9."

   By Mr B.'s favour, Christ is not said to have a God, though God be said
   to be his God. Verse 8, Christ, by Mr B.'s confession, is expressly
   called God. He is, then, the one true God with the Father, or another.
   If the first, what doth he contend about? If the second, he is a god
   that is not God by nature, -- that is, not the one God of Christians,
   -- and consequently an idol; and indeed such is the Christ that Mr B.
   worshippeth. Whether this will be waived by the help of that
   expression, verse 9, "God, thy God," where it is expressly spoken of
   him in respect of his undertaking the office of mediation, wherein he
   was "anointed of God with the oil of gladness above his fellows," God
   and his saints will judge.

   Thus the close of this chapter, through the good, wise hand of the
   providence of God, leaving himself and his truth not without witness,
   hath produced instances and evidences of the truth opposed abundantly
   sufficient, without farther inquiry and labour, to discover the
   sophistry and vanity of all Mr B.'s former queries and insinuations;
   for which let him have the praise.

Chapter VIII.

   An entrance into the examination of the Racovian Catechism in the
   business of the deity of Christ -- Their arguments against it answered;
   and testimonies of the eternity of Christ vindicated.

   III. Although the testimonies and arguments for the deity of Christ
   might be urged and handled to a better advantage, if liberty might be
   used to insist upon them in the method that seems most natural for the
   clearing and confirmation of this important truth, yet that I may do
   two works at once, I shall insist chiefly, if not only on those texts
   of Scripture which are proposed to be handled and answered by the
   author or authors of the Racovian Catechism; which work takes up near
   one-fourth part of their book, and, as it is well known, there is no
   part of it wherein so much diligence, pains, sophistry, and cunning are
   employed as in that chapter, "Of the person of Christ," which by God's
   assistance we are entering upon the consideration of.

   Those who have considered their writings know that the very substance
   of all they have to say for the evading of the force of our testimonies
   for the eternal deity of Christ is comprised in that chapter, there
   being not any thing material that any of them have elsewhere written
   there omitted. And those who are acquainted with them, their persons
   and abilities, do also know that their great strength and ability for
   disputation lies in giving plausible answers, and making exceptions
   against testimonies, cavilling at every word and letter; being in proof
   and argument for the most part weak and contemptible. And therefore, in
   this long chapter, of near a hundred pages, all that themselves propose
   by way of argument against the deity of Christ is contained in two or
   three at the most, the residue being wholly taken up with exceptions to
   so many of the texts of Scripture wherein the deity of Christ is
   asserted as they have been pleased to take notice of, -- a course which
   themselves are forced to apologize for as unbecoming catechists. [286]

   I shall, then, the Lord assisting, consider that whole chapter of
   theirs in both parts of it, -- as to what they have to say for
   themselves, or to plead against the deity of Christ, as also what they
   bring forth for their defence against the evidence of the light that
   shineth from the texts whose consideration they propose to themselves,
   to which many of like sort may be added.

   I shall only inform the reader that this is a business quite beyond my
   first intention in this treatise, to whose undertaking I have been
   prevailed on by the desires and entreaties of some who knew that I had
   this other work imposed on me.

   Their first question and answer are:--

   Ques. Declare now to me what I ought to know concerning Jesus Christ?

   Ans. Thou must know that of the things of which thou oughtest to know,
   some belong to the essence of Christ and some to his office.

   Q. What are they which relate to his person?

   A. That only that by nature he is a true man, even u the Scriptures do
   often witness, amongst others, 1 Tim. ii. 5, 1 Cor. xv. 21; such a one
   as God of old promised by the prophets, and such as the creed, commonly
   called the Apostles', witnesseth him to be; which, with us, all
   Christians embrace. [287]

   Ans. That Jesus Christ was a true man, in his nature like unto us, sin
   only excepted, we believe, and do abhor the abominations of Paracelsus,
   Wigelius, etc., and the Familists amongst ourselves, who destroy the
   verity of his human nature. But that the Socinians believe the same,
   that he is a man in heaven, whatever he was upon earth, I presume the
   reader will judge that it may be justly questioned, from what I have to
   offer (and shall do it in its place) on that account. But that this is
   all that we ought to know concerning the person of Christ is a thing of
   whose folly and vanity our catechists will be one day convinced. The
   present trial of it between us depends in part on the consideration of
   the scriptures which shall afterward be produced to evince the
   contrary, our plea from whence shall not here be anticipated. The
   places of Scripture they mention prove him to be a true man, -- that as
   man he died and rose; but that he who was man was not also in one
   person God (the name of man there expressing the person, not the nature
   of man only) they prove not. The prophets foretold that Christ should
   be such a man as should also be the Son of God, begotten of him, Ps.
   ii. 7; "The mighty God," Isa. ix. 6, 7; "Jehovah," Jer. xxiii. 6; "The
   Lord of hosts," Zech. ii. 8, 9. And the Apostles' Creed also (as it is
   unjustly called) confesseth him to be the only Son of God, our Lord,
   and requires us to believe in him as we do in God the Father; which if
   he were not God were an accursed thing, Jer. xvii. 5.

   Q. Is therefore the Lord Jesus a pure (or mere) man?

   A. By no means; for he was conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of the
   Virgin Mary, and therefore from his very conception and birth was the
   Son of God, as we read, Luke i. 35, that I may not bring other causes,
   which thou wilt afterward find in the person of Christ, which most
   evidently declare that the Lord Jesus can by no means be esteemed a
   pure (or mere) man. [288]

   Ans. 1. But I have abundantly demonstrated that Christ neither was nor
   was called the Son of God upon the account here mentioned, nor any
   other whatever intimated in the close of the answer, but merely and
   solely on that of his eternal generation of the essence of his Father.

   2. The inquiry is after the essence of Christ, which receives not any
   alteration by any kind of eminency or dignity that belongs to his
   person. If Christ be by essence only man, let him have what dignity or
   honour he can have possibly conferred upon him, let him be born by what
   means soever, as to his essence and nature he is a man still, but a
   man, and not more than a man, -- that is, purus homo, a "mere man," --
   and not phusei Theos, "God by nature," but such a god as the Gentiles
   worshipped, Gal. iv. 8. His being made God and the Son of God
   afterward, which our catechists pretend, relating to office and
   dignity, not to his nature, exempts him not at all from being a mere
   man. This, then, is but a flourish to delude poor simple souls into a
   belief of their honourable thoughts of Christ, whom yet they think no
   otherwise of than the Turks do of Mohammed, nor believe he was
   otherwise indeed, or is to Christians, than as Moses to the Jews That
   which Paul speaks of the idols of the heathen, that they were not gods
   by nature, may, according to the apprehension of these catechists, be
   spoken of Christ; notwithstanding any exaltation or deification that he
   hath received, he is by nature no god. Yea, the apprehensions of these
   gentlemen concerning Christ and his deity are the same upon the matter
   with those of the heathen concerning their worthies and heroes, who, by
   an apotheosis, were translated into the number of their gods, as
   Jupiter, Hercules, and others. They called them gods, indeed; but put
   them close to it, they acknowledged that properly there was but one
   God, but that these men were honoured as being, upon [account of] their
   great worth and noble achievements, taken up to blessedness and power.
   Such an hero, an Hermes or Mercury, do they make of Jesus Christ, who,
   for his faithful declaring the will of God, was deified; but in respect
   of essence and nature, which here is inquired after, if he be any thing
   according to their principles (of making which supposal I shall give
   the reader a fair account), he was, he is, and will be, a mere man to
   all eternity, and no more. They allow him no more, as to his essence,
   than that wherein he was like us in all things, sin only excepted, Heb.
   ii. 17.

   Q. You said a little above that the Lord Jesus is by nature man; hath
   he also a divine nature?

   A. No; for that is not only repugnant to sound reason, but also to the
   Scriptures. [289]

   But this is that which is now to be put to the trial, Whether the
   asserting of the deity of Christ be repugnant to the Scriptures or no.
   And as we shall see in the issue that as these catechists have not been
   able to answer or evade the evidence of any one testimony of Scripture,
   of more than an hundred that are produced for the confirmation of the
   truth of his eternal deity, so, notwithstanding the pretended flourish
   here at the entrance, that they are not able to produce any one place
   of Scripture, so much as in appearance, rising up against it. [As] for
   that right reason, which in this matter of mere divine revelation they
   boast of, and give it the pre-eminence in their disputes against the
   person of Christ above the Scripture, unless they discover the
   consonancy of it to the word, to the law and testimony, whatever they
   propose on that account may be rejected with as much facility as it is
   proposed. But yet, if by "right reason" they understand reason so far
   captivated to the obedience of faith as to acquiesce in whatever God
   hath revealed, and to receive it as truth, -- than which duty there is
   not any more eminent dictate of right reason indeed, -- we for ever
   deny the first part of this assertion, and shall now attend to the
   proof of it. Nor do we here plead that reason is blind and corrupted,
   and that the natural man cannot discern the things of God, and so
   require that men do prove themselves regenerate before we admit them to
   judge of the truth of the propositions under debate; which though
   necessary for them who would know the gospel for their own good, so as
   to be wise unto salvation, yet it being the grammatical and literal
   sense of propositions as laid down in the word of the Scripture that we
   are to judge of in this case, we require no more of men, to the purpose
   in hand, but an assent to this proposition (which if they will not
   give, we can by undeniable demonstration compel them to), "Whatever
   God, who is prima veritas, hath revealed is true, whether we can
   comprehend the things revealed or no;" which being granted, we proceed
   with our catechists in their attempt.

   Q. Declare how it is contrary to right reason.

   A. 1. In this regard, that two substances having contrary properties
   cannot meet in one person; such as are to be mortal and immortal, to
   have a beginning and to want a beginning, to be changeable and
   unchangeable. 2. Because two natures, each of them constituting a
   person, cannot likewise agree or meet in one person; for instead of one
   there must (then) be two persons, and so also two Christs would exist,
   whom all without controversy acknowledge to be one, and his person one.
   [290]

   And this is all which these gentlemen offer to make good their
   assertion that the deity of Christ is repugnant to right reason; which,
   therefore, upon what small pretence they have done, will quickly
   appear.

   1. It is true that there cannot be such a personal uniting of two
   substances with such diverse properties as by that union to make an
   exequation, or an equalling of those diverse properties; but that there
   may not be such a concurrence and meeting of such different substances
   in one person, both of them preserving entire to themselves their
   essential properties, which are so diverse, there is nothing pleaded
   nor pretended. And to suppose that there cannot be such an union is to
   beg the thing in question against the evidence of many express
   testimonies of Scripture, without tendering the least inducement for
   any to grant their request.

   2. In calling these properties of the several natures in Christ
   "adverse" or "contrary," they would insinuate a consideration of them
   as of qualities in a subject, whose mutual contrariety should prove
   destructive to the one, if not both, or, by a mixture, cause an
   exurgency of qualities of another temperature. But neither are these
   properties such qualities, nor are they inherent in any common subject;
   but [they are] inseparable adjuncts of the different natures of Christ,
   never mixed with one another, nor capable of any such thing to
   eternity, nor ever becoming properties of the other nature, which they
   belong not unto, though all of them do denominate the person wherein
   both the natures do subsist. So that instead of pleading reason, which
   they pretended they would, they do nothing, in this first part of their
   answer, but beg the thing in question; which, being of so much
   importance and concernment to our souls, is never like to be granted
   them on any such terms. Will Christ, on their entreaties, cease to be
   God?

   Neither is their second pretended argument of any other kind.

   1. We deny that the human nature of Christ had any such subsistence of
   its own as to give it a proper personality, being from the time of its
   conception assumed into subsistence with the Son of God. This we prove
   by express texts of Scripture, Isa. vii. 14, ix. 6; John i. 14; Rom. i.
   3, ix. 5; Heb. ii. 16; Luke i. 35; Heb. ix. 14; Acts iii. 15, xx. 28;
   Phil. ii. 7; 1 Cor. ii. 8, etc.; and by arguments taken from the
   assigning of all the diverse properties by them mentioned before, and
   sundry others, to the same person of Christ, etc. That we would take it
   for granted that this cannot be, is the modest request of these
   gentlemen with whom we have to do.

   2. If by natures constituting persons they mean those who, antecedently
   to their union, have actually done so, we grant they cannot meet in one
   person, so that upon this union they should cease to be two persons.
   The personality of either of them being destroyed, their different
   beings could not be preserved. But if by "constituting" they understand
   only that which is so in potentia, or a next possibility of
   constituting a person, then, as before, they only beg of us that we
   would not believe that the person of the Word did assume the human
   nature of Christ, that "holy thing that was born of the Virgin," into
   subsistence with itself; which, for the reasons before mentioned, and
   others like to them, we cannot grant.

   And this is the substance of all that these men plead and make a noise
   with in the world, in an opposition to the eternal deity of the Son of
   God! This pretence of reason (which evidently comes short of being any
   thing else) is their shield and buckler in the cause they have
   unhappily undertaken. When they tell us of Christ's being hungry and
   dying, we say it was in the human nature, wherein he was obnoxious to
   such things no less than we, being therein made like unto us in all
   things, sin only excepted; -- when of his submission and subjection to
   his Father, we tell them it is in respect of the office of mediator,
   which he willingly undertook, and that his inequality unto him as to
   that office doth no way prejudice his equality with him in respect of
   his nature and being. But when, with the Scriptures and arguments from
   thence, as clear and convincing as if they were written with the beams
   of the sun, we prove our dear Lord Jesus, in respect of a divine
   nature, whereof he was partaker from eternity, to be God, blessed for
   ever, they tell us it cannot be that two such diverse natures as those
   of God and man should be united in one person; and it cannot be so,
   because it cannot be so, -- there is no such union among other things!
   And these things must be, that those who axe approved may be tried. But
   let us hear them out.

   Q. But whereas they show that Christ consisteth of a divine and human
   nature, as a man consisteth of soul and body, what is to be answered
   them?

   A. That here is a very great difference; for they say that the two
   natures in Christ are so united that Christ is both God and man. But
   the soul and body are in that manner conjoined in man, that a man is
   neither soul nor body; for neither soul nor body doth singly of itself
   constitute a person. But as the divine nature by itself constitutes a
   person, so it is necessary that the human nature should do. [291]

   Ans. 1. In what sense it may be said that Christ, that is, the person
   of Christ, consisteth of a divine and human nature, was before
   declared. The person of the Son of God assumed the human nature into
   subsistence with itself, and both in that one person are Christ.

   2. If our catechists have no more to say, to the illustration given of
   the union of the two natures in the person of Christ by that of the
   soul and body in one human person, but that there is "a great
   difference" in something between them, they do but filch away the
   grains that are allowed to every similitude, and show wherein the
   comparates differ, but answer not to that wherein they do agree.

   3. All that is intended by this similitude is, to show that besides the
   change of things, one into another, by the loss of one, as of water
   into wine by Christ, and besides the union that is in physical
   generation by mixture, whereby and from whence some third thing
   ariseth, that also there is a substantial union, whereby one thing is
   not turned into another nor mixed with it. And the end of using this
   similitude (which, to please our catechists, we can forbear,
   acknowledging that there is not among created beings any thing that can
   fully represent this, which we confess "without controversy to be a
   great mystery") is only to manifest the folly of that assertion of
   their master on John i., "That if the Word be made flesh' in our sense,
   it must be turned into flesh; for," saith he, "one thing cannot be made
   another but by change, conversion, and mutation into it:" the absurdity
   of which assertion is sufficiently evinced by the substantial union of
   soul and body, made one person, without that alteration and change of
   their natures which is pleaded for. Neither is the Word made flesh by
   alteration, but by union.

   4. It is confessed that the soul is not said to be made the body, nor
   the body said to be made the soul, as the Word is said to be made
   flesh; for the union of soul and body is not a union of distinct
   substances subsisting in one common subsistence, but a union of two
   parts of one nature, whereof the one is the form of the other. And
   herein is the dissimilitude of that similitude. Hence will that
   predication be justified in Christ, "The Word was made flesh," without
   any change or alteration, because of that subsistence whereunto the
   flesh or human nature of Christ was assumed, which is common to them
   both. And so it is in accidental predications. When we say a man is
   made white, black, or pale, we do not intend that he is as to his
   substance changed into whiteness, etc., but that he who is a man is
   also become white.

   5. It is true that the soul is not a person, nor the body, but a person
   is the exurgency of their conjunction: and therefore we do not say that
   herein the similitude is [to be] urged, for the divine nature of Christ
   had its own personality antecedent to this union; nor is the union of
   his person the union of several parts of the same nature, but the
   concurrence of several natures in one subsistence.

   6. That it is "of necessity that Christ's human nature should of itself
   constitute a person," is urged upon the old account of begging the
   thing in question. This is that which in the case of Christ we deny,
   and produce all the proofs before mentioned to make evident the reason
   of our denial; but our great masters here say the contrary, and our
   under-catechists are resolved to believe them. Christ was a true man,
   because he had the true essence of a man, soul and body, with all their
   essential properties. A peculiar personality belongeth not to the
   essence of a man, but to his existence in such a manner. Neither do we
   deny Christ to have a person as a man, but to have a human person: for
   the human nature of Christ subsisteth in that which, though it be in
   itself divine, yet as to that act of sustentation which it gives the
   human nature, is the subsistence of a man; on which account the
   subsistence of the human nature of Christ is made more noble and
   excellent than that of any other man whatever.

   And this is the whole plea of our catechists from reason, that whereto
   they so much pretend, and which they give the pre-eminence unto in
   their attempts against the deity of Christ, as the chief, if not the
   only engine they have to work by. And if they be thus weak in the main
   body of their forces, certainly that reserve which they pretend from
   Scripture, -- whereof, indeed, they have the meanest pretence and show
   that ever any of the sons of men had who were necessitated to make a
   plea from it in a matter of so great concernment as that now under
   consideration, -- will quickly disappear. Thus, then, they proceed:--

   Q. Declare, also, how it is repugnant to Scripture that Christ hath a
   divine nature.

   A. First, Because that the Scripture proposeth to us one only God by
   nature, whom we have above declared to be the Father of Christ.
   Secondly, The same Scripture testifieth that Jesus Christ was by nature
   a man, whereby it taketh from him any divine nature. Thirdly, Because
   whatever divine thing Christ hath, the Scripture plainly teacheth that
   he had it by a gift of the Father, Matt. xxviii. 18; Phil. ii. 9; 1
   Cor. xv. 27; John v. 19, x. 25. Lastly, Because the same Scripture most
   evidently showing that Jesus Christ did not vindicate and ascribe all
   his divine works to himself, or to any divine nature of his own, but to
   his Father, makes it plain that divine nature in Christ was altogether
   in vain, and would have been without any cause. [292]

   And this is that which our catechists have to pretend from Scripture
   against the deity of Christ, concluding that any such divine nature in
   him would be superfluous and needless, -- themselves being judges. In
   the strength of what here they have urged, they set themselves to evade
   the evidence of near fifty express texts of Scripture, by themselves
   produced and insisted on, giving undeniable testimony to the truth they
   oppose. Let, then, what they have brought forth be briefly
   considered:--

   1. The Scripture doth indeed propose unto us "one only God by nature,"
   and we confess that that only true God is the "Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ;" but we say that the Son is partaker of the Father's nature, of
   the same nature with him, as being his proper Son, and, by his own
   testimony, one with him. He is such a Son (as hath been declared) as is
   begotten of the essence of his Father; and is therefore God, blessed
   for ever. If the Father be God by nature, so is the Son; for he is of
   the same nature with the Father.

   2. To conclude that Christ is not God because he is man, is plainly and
   evidently to beg the thing in question. We evidently discover in the
   person of Christ properties that are inseparable adjuncts of a divine
   nature, and such also as no less properly belong to a human nature.
   From the asserting of the one of these to conclude to a denial of the
   other, is to beg that which they are not able to dig for.

   3. There is a twofold communication of the Father to the Son:-- (1.) By
   eternal generation. So the Son receives his personality, and therein
   his divine nature, from him who said unto him, "Thou art my Son; this
   day have I begotten thee." And this is so far from disproving the deity
   of Christ that it abundantly confirms it. And this is mentioned, John
   v. 19-23. This Christ hath by nature. (2.) By collation of gifts,
   honour and dignity, exaltation and glory, upon him as mediator, or in
   respect of that office which he humbled himself to undergo, and for the
   full execution whereof and investiture [where] with glory, honour, and
   power were needful; which is mentioned, Matt. xxviii. 18, Phil. ii. 9,
   1 Cor. xv. 27: which is by no means derogatory to the deity of the Son;
   for inequality in respect of office is well consistent with equality in
   respect of nature. This Christ hath by grace. Matt. xxviii. 18, Christ
   speaks of himself as thoroughly furnished with authority for the
   accomplishing of the work of mediation which he had undertaken. It is
   of his office, not of his nature or essence, that he speaks. Phil. ii.
   9, Christ is said to be exalted; which he was in respect of the real
   exaltation given to his human nature, and the manifestation of the
   glory of his divine, which he had with his Father before the world was,
   but had eclipsed for a season. 1 Cor. xv. 27 relates to the same
   exaltation of Christ as before.

   4. It is false that Christ doth not ascribe the divine works which he
   wrought to himself and his own divine power, although that he often
   also makes mention of the Father, as by whose appointment he wrought
   those works, as mediator: John v. 17, "My Father worketh hitherto, and
   I work;" verse 19, "For what things soever the Father doeth, these also
   doeth the Son;" verse 21, "For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and
   quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom he will." Himself
   wrought the works that he did, though as to the end of his working
   them, which belonged to his office of mediation, he still relates to
   his Father's designation and appointment.

   And this is the whole of our catechists' plea from reason and Scripture
   against the deity of Christ. [As] for the conclusion, of the
   superfluousness and needlessness of such a divine nature in the
   Mediator, as it argues them to be ignorant of the Scriptures, and of
   the righteousness of God, and of the nature of sin, so it might
   administer occasion to insist upon the demonstration of the necessity
   which there was that he who was to be mediator between God and man
   should be both God and man, but that I aim at brevity, and the
   consideration of it may possibly fall in upon another account, so that
   here I shall not insist thereon.

   Nextly, then, they address themselves to that which is their proper
   work (wherein they are exceedingly delighted), -- namely, in giving in
   exceptions against the testimonies produced for the confirmation of the
   truth under consideration, which they thus enter upon:--

   Q. But they endeavour to assert the divine nature of Christ from the
   Scriptures.

   A. They endeavour it, indeed, diverse ways; and that whilst they study
   either to evince out of certain scriptures what is not in them, or
   whilst they argue perversely from those things which are in the
   scriptures, and so evilly bring their business to pass. [293]

   These, it seems, are the general heads of our arguments for the deity
   of Christ; but before we part we shall bring our catechists to another
   reckoning, and manifest both that what we assert is expressly contained
   in the Scriptures, and what we conclude by ratiocination from them hath
   an evidence in it which they are not able to resist. But they say, --

   Q. What are those things which they labour to evince concerning Christ
   out of the Scriptures, which are not contained in them?

   A. Of this sort is, as they speak, his pre-eternity; which they
   endeavour to confirm with two sorts of scriptures:-- 1. Such as wherein
   they suppose this pre-eternity is expressed; 2. Such as wherein, though
   it be not expressed, yet they think that it may be gathered from them.
   [294]

   That we do not only "suppose," but have also as great an assurance as
   the plain, evident, and redoubled testimony of the Holy Ghost can give
   us of the eternity of Jesus Christ, shall be made evident in the
   ensuing testimonies, both of the one sort and the other, especially by
   such as are express thereunto; for in this matter we shall very little
   trouble the reader with collections and arguings, the matter inquired
   after being express and evident in the words and terms of the Holy
   Ghost himself. They say, then, --

   Q. Which are those testimonies of Scripture which seem to them to
   express his pre-eternity?

   A. They are those in which the Scripture witnesseth of Christ that he
   was in the beginning, that he was in heaven, that he was before
   Abraham, John i. 1, vi. 62, viii. 58. [295]

   Before I come to the consideration of the particular places proposed by
   them to be insisted on, I shall desire to premise one or two things;
   as, --

   1. That it is sufficient for the disproving of their hypothesis
   concerning Christ if we prove him to have been existent before his
   incarnation, whether the testimonies whereby we prove it reach
   expressly to the proof of his eternity or no. That which they have
   undertaken to maintain is, that Christ had no existence before his
   conception and birth of the Virgin; -- which if it be disproved, they
   do not, they cannot, deny but that it must be on the account of a
   divine nature; for as to the incarnation of any preexisting creature
   (which was the Arians' madness), they disavow and oppose it.

   2. That those three places mentioned are very far from being all
   wherein there is express confirmation of the eternity of Christ; and
   therefore, when I have gone through the consideration of them, I shall
   add some others also, which are of no less evidence and perspicuity
   than those whose vindication we are by them called unto.

   To the first place mentioned they thus proceed:--

   Q. What dost thou answer to the first?

   A. In the place cited there is nothing about that pre-eternity, seeing
   here is mention of the beginning, which is opposed to eternity. But the
   word "beginning" is almost always in the Scripture referred to the
   subject-matter, as may be seen, Dan. viii. 1; John xv. 27, xvi. 4; Acts
   xi. 15: and therefore, seeing the subject-matter here is the gospel,
   whose description John undertakes, without doubt, by his word
   "beginning," John understood the beginning of the gospel. [296]

   This place being express to our purpose, and the matter of great
   importance, I shall first confirm the truth contended for from thence,
   and then remove the miserable subterfuge which our catechists have
   received from their great apostles, uncle and nephew.

   1. That John, thus expressly insisting on the deity of Christ in the
   beginning of his Gospel, intended to disprove and condemn sundry that
   were risen up in those days denying it, or asserting the creation or
   making of the world to another demiurgus, we have the unquestionable
   testimony of the first professors of the religion of Jesus Christ, with
   as much evidence and clearness of truth as any thing can be tendered on
   uncontrolled tradition; which at least will give some insight into the
   intendment of the Holy Ghost in the words. [297]

   2. That by ho Logos, howsoever rendered, Verbum or Sermo, or on what
   account soever he be so called, either as being the eternal Word and
   Wisdom of the Father, or as the great Revealer of his will unto us
   (which yet of itself is not a sufficient cause of that appellation, for
   others also reveal the will of God unto us, Acts xx. 27, Heb. i. 1),
   Jesus Christ is intended, is on all hands confessed, and may be
   undeniably evinced from the context This ho Logos came into the world
   and was rejected by his own, verse 11; yea, expressly, he "was made
   flesh," and was "the only-begotten of the Father," verse 14.

   3. That the whole of our argument from this place is very far from
   consisting in that expression, "In the beginning," though that,
   relating to the matter whereof the apostle treats, doth evidently
   evince the truth pleaded for. It is part of our catechists' trade so to
   divide the words of Scripture that their main import and tendence may
   not be perceived. In one place they answer to the first words, "In the
   beginning;" in another, to "He was with God, and he was God;" in a
   third, to that, "All things were made by him;" in a fourth (all at a
   great distance one from another), to "The Word was made flesh:" which
   desperate course of proceeding argues that their cause is also
   desperate, and that they durst not meet this one testimony, as by the
   Holy Ghost placed and ordered for the confirmation of our faith,
   without such a bold mangling of the text as that instanced in.

   4. I shall, then, insist upon the whole of this testimony as the words
   are placed in the contexture by the Holy Ghost, and vindicate them from
   what, in several places, they have excepted against several parcels of
   them. Thus, then, from these words (these divine words, whose very
   reading reclaimed as eminent a scholar as the world enjoyed in his days
   from atheism [298] ) we proceed.

   He that was in the beginning before the creation of the world, before
   any thing of all things that are made was made, who was then with God,
   and was God, who made all things, and without whom nothing was made, in
   whom was life, -- he is God by nature, blessed for ever; nor is there,
   in the whole Scripture, a more glorious and eminent description of God,
   by his attributes, names, and works, than here is given of him
   concerning whom all these things are spoken. But now all this is
   expressly affirmed of the "Word that was made flesh;" that is,
   confessedly, of Jesus Christ: therefore he is God by nature, blessed
   for ever. Unto the several parts of this plain and evident testimony,
   in several places they except several things; thinking thereby to evade
   that strength and light which each part yields to other as they lie,
   and all of them to the whole. I shall consider them in order as they
   come to hand.

   Against that expression, "In the beginning," they except, in the place
   mentioned above, that it doth not signify pre-eternity, which hath no
   beginning. But, --

   1. This impedes not at all the existence of Jesus Christ before the
   creation, although it denies that his eternity is expressly asserted.
   Now, to affirm that Christ did exist before the whole creation, and
   made all things, doth no less prove him to be no more a creature, but
   the eternal God, than the most express testimony of his eternity doth
   or can do. 2. Though eternity has no beginning, and the sense of these
   words cannot be, "In the beginning of eternity," yet eternity is before
   all things, and "In the beginning" may be the description of eternity,
   as it is plainly, Prov. viii. 23. "From everlasting," and "In the
   beginning, before the earth was," are of the same import. And the
   Scripture saying that "In the beginning the Word was," not "was made,"
   doth as evidently express eternity as it doth in these other phrases
   of, "Before the world was," or "Before the foundation of the world,"
   which more than once it insists on, John xvii. 5. 3. By "In the
   beginning" is intended before the creation of all things. What will it
   avail our catechists if it do not expressly denote eternity? Why, the
   word "beginning" is to be interpreted variously, according to the
   subject-matter spoken of, as Gen. i. 1; which being here the gospel, it
   is the beginning of the gospel that is intended! But, --

   Be it agreed that the word "beginning" is to be understood according to
   the subject-matter whereunto it is applied, yet that the apostle doth
   firstly and nextly treat of the gospel, as to the season of its
   preaching, is most absurd. He treats evidently and professedly of the
   person of the author of the gospel, of the Word that was God and was
   made flesh. And that this cannot be wrested to the sense intended is
   clear; for, -- 1. The apostle evidently alludes to the first words of
   Genesis, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth;" and
   the Syriac translation from the Hebrew here places br syt?. So here,
   "In the beginning the Word made all things." 2. The following words,
   "The Word was with God, and the Word was God," manifest the intendment
   of the Holy Ghost to be, to declare what and where the Word was before
   the creation of the world, even with God. 3. The testimony that he was
   God in the beginning will no way agree with this gloss. Take his being
   God in their sense, yet they deny that he was God in the beginning of
   the gospel or before his suffering, as hath been showed. 4. The sense
   given by the Socinians to this place is indeed senseless. "In the
   beginning," say they, "that is, when the gospel began to be preached by
   John Baptist" (which is plainly said to be before the world was made),
   "the Word, or the man Jesus Christ" (the Word being afterward said to
   be made flesh, after this whole description of him as the Word), "was
   with God, so hidden as that he was known only to God" (which is false,
   for he was known to his mother, to Joseph, to John Baptist, to Simeon,
   Anna, and to others), "and the Word was God; that is, God appointed
   that he should be so afterward, or made God" (though it be said he was
   God then when he was with God). "And all things were made by him; the
   new creature was made by him; or the world by his preaching, and
   teaching, and working miracles, was made, or reformed" (that is,
   something was mended by him). Such interpretations we may at any time
   be supplied withal at an easy rate. 5. To view it a little farther: "In
   the beginning, -- that is, when John preached Jesus, and said, Behold
   the Lamb of God,' -- was the Word, or Jesus was;" that is, he was when
   John preached that he was. "Egregiam vero laudem!" He was when he was!
   "The Word was in the beginning;" that is, Jesus was flesh and blood,
   and then was afterward made flesh, and dwelt among us, when he had
   dwelt amongst us! And this is that interpretation which Faustus
   Socinus, receiving from his uncle Lælius, first set up upon, in the
   strength whereof he went forth unto all the abominations which
   afterward he so studiously vented.

   Passing by these two weighty and most material passages of this
   testimony, "The Word was God," and "The Word was with God," the one
   evidencing his oneness of nature with, and the other his distinctness
   of personality from, his Father, our catechists, after an interposition
   of near twenty pages, fix upon verse 3, and attempt to pervert the
   express words and intendment of it, having cut it off from its
   dependence on what went before, that evidently gives light into the aim
   of the Holy Ghost therein. Their words concerning this verse are, --

   Q. Declare to me with what testimonies they contend to prove that
   Christ created the heaven and the earth?

   A. With those where it is written, that "by him all things were made,
   and without him was nothing made that was made," and "the world was
   made by him," John i. 3, 10; as also Col. i. 16; Heb. i. 2, 10-12.

   Q. But how dost thou answer to the first testimony?

   A. 1. It is not, in the first testimony, they were created, but they
   were "made." 2. John says "They were made by him;" which manner of
   speaking doth not express him who is the first cause of any thing, but
   the second or mediate cause. Lastly, The word "all things" is not taken
   for all things universally, but is altogether related to the
   subject-matter; which is most frequent in the Scriptures, especially of
   the New Testament, whereof there is a signal example, 2 Cor. v. 17,
   wherein there is a discourse of a thing very like to this whereof John
   treats, where it is said "All things are made new," whereas it is
   certain that there are many things which are not made new. Now, whereas
   the subject-matter in John is the gospel, it appeareth that this word
   "all things" is to be received only of all those things which belong to
   the gospel.

   Q. But why doth John add, that "without him nothing was made that was
   made?"

   A. John added these words that he might the better illustrate those
   before spoken, "All things were made by him;" which seem to import that
   all those things were made by the Word or Son of God, although some of
   them, and those of great moment, were of such sort as were not done by
   him but the apostles, -- as the calling of the Gentiles, the abolishing
   of legal ceremonies: for although these things had their original from
   the preaching and works of the Lord Jesus, yet they were not perfected
   by Christ himself, but by his apostles; but yet not without him, for
   the apostles administered all things in his name and authority, as the
   Lord himself said, "Without me ye can do nothing," John xv. 5. [299]

   Thus to the third verse, of which afterward. We shall quickly see how
   these men are put to their shifts to escape the sword of this witness,
   which stands in the way to cut them off in their journeying to curse
   the church and people of God by denying the deity of their blessed
   Saviour.

   The connection of the words is wholly omitted, "He was God, and he was
   in the beginning with God, and all things were made by him." The words
   are an illustration of his divine nature by divine power and works, He
   was God, and he made all things. "He that made all things is God," Heb.
   iii. 4; "The Word made all things," John i. 3: therefore he is God. Let
   us see what is answered.

   1. "It is not said they were created by him, but made.'?" But the word
   here used by John is the same that in sundry places the LXX. (whom the
   writers of the New Testament followed) used about the creation; as Gen.
   i. 3, Kai eipen ho Theos Genetheto phos kai egeneto phos, and verse 6,
   Egeneto stereoma. And if, as it is affirmed, he was in the beginning
   (before all things), and made them all, he made them out of nothing;
   that is, he created them. To create is but to produce something out of
   nothing, "nothing" supplying the term from whence of their production.
   But, --

   2. "They are said to be made by him:' it is di' autou, which denotes
   not the principal, but mediate or instrumental cause." But it is most
   evident that these men care not what they say, so they may say
   something that they think will trouble them whom they oppose.

   (1.) This might help the Arians, who fancied Christ to be created or
   made before all things, and to have been the instrumental cause whereby
   God created all other things; but how this concerns them to insist on
   who deny that Christ had any existence at all before the world was some
   thousands of years old is not easy to be apprehended.

   (2.) In their own sense this is not to the purpose, but expressly
   contradictory to what they offer in the last place, by way of answer to
   the latter part of the third verse. Here they say he is not the
   principal efficient cause, but the second or mediate; there, that all
   things were either done by him or in his name and authority, which
   certainly denotes the principal cause of the things done. But, --

   (3.) This very expression is sundry times used concerning God the
   Father himself whom our catechists will not therefore deny to have been
   the principal efficient cause of the things ascribed to him: Rom. xi.
   36, "From him, and di' autou, by him are all things;" 1 Cor. i. 9, "God
   is faithful, di' ou, by whom ye were called;" Gal. i. 1, "Paul, an
   apostle, not of men, neither by man, but dia Iesou Christou kai Theou
   Patros, by Jesus Christ and God the Father;" Eph. i. 1, Dia thelematos
   Theou, "By the will of God." So that this also is frivolous. Thus far
   we have nothing to the purpose. But, --

   3. "?All things' are to be referred to the gospel, all things of the
   gospel whereof John treats; so are the words to be restrained by the
   subject-matter." But, --

   (1.) This is merely begged. John speaks not one word of the gospel as
   such, gives no description of it, its nature or effects; but evidently,
   plainly, and directly speaks of the Word that was God, and that made
   all things, describing him in his eternity, his works, his incarnation,
   his employment, his coming into the world, and his business; and treats
   of the gospel, or the declaration of the will of God by Jesus Christ,
   distinctly afterward, from verse 15 and forwards,

   (2.) For the expression, 2 Cor. v. 17, "All things are become new," it
   is expressly restrained to the "new creature," to them that are "in
   Christ Jesus;" but as to this general expression here, there is no
   colour why it should be so restrained, the expression itself everywhere
   signifying the creation of all things. See Gen. ii. 1, 2; Ps. xxxiii.
   6, cxxi. 2; Isa. xxxvii. 16, xliv. 24, lxvi. 1, 2; Jer. xxxii. 17; Acts
   xiv. 15, xvii. 24.

   And this is it which they plead to the first part of the verse, "All
   things were made by him."

   4. The other expression, they say, is added to manifest that "what was
   done after by the apostles was not done without him; and that is the
   meaning of these words, And without him was not any thing made that was
   made.'?" But, --

   (1.) Their proton pseudos, of referring the whole passage to the
   description of the gospel, whereof there is not the least tittle nor
   intimation in the text, being removed out of the way, this following
   figment falls of itself.

   (2.) This gloss is expressly contrary to the text. The "all things"
   here mentioned are the "all things" that were made in the beginning of
   the world, but this gloss refers it to the things made in the end of
   the world.

   (3.) It is contradictory to itself, for by the "beginning" they
   understand the beginning of the gospel, or the first preaching of it,
   but the things that they say here were made by Christ are things that
   were done after his ascension.

   (4.) It is true, the apostles wrought not any miracles, effected no
   mighty works, but by the presence of Christ with them (though the text
   cited to prove it, John xv. 5, be quite of another importance, as
   speaking of gospel obedience, not works of miracles or conversions);
   but that those works of theirs, or his by them, are here intended, is
   not offered to proof by our catechists. And this is the sense of the
   words they give: "Christ in the beginning of the gospel made all
   things, or all things were made by him, even those which he made by
   others after his ascension into heaven;" or thus, "All things, that is,
   some things, were made, that is, mended, by him, that is, the apostles,
   in the beginning of the gospel, that is, after his ascension."

   (5.) Our sense of the words is plain and obvious, Says the apostle, "He
   who was in the beginning, and was God, made all things;" which he first
   expresseth positively, and then by an universal negative confirms and
   explains what was before asserted in an universal affirmative, "Without
   him was not any thing made that was made."

   And this is the sum of what they have to except against this part of
   our testimony, than which nothing can be more vain and frivolous.

   The 10th verse is also by them taken under consideration, and these
   words therein, "The world was made by him;" against which this is their
   procedure:--

   Q. What dost thou answer to the second?

   A. 1. That John doth not write here that the world was created, but
   "made." 2. He uses the same manner of speech which signifieth the
   mediate cause; for he saith "The world was made by him." Lastly, This
   word mundus, the world, as others of the same import, doth not only
   denote heaven and earth, but, besides other significations, it either
   signifieth human kind, as the present place manifesteth, "He was in the
   world, and the world knew him not," and John xii. 19, or also future
   immortality, as Heb. i. 6; which is to be understood of the world to
   come, as it appears from chap. ii., where he saith, "He hath not put
   the world to come into subjection to the angels, of which we speak,"
   but he had nowhere spoken of it but chap. i. 6. Furthermore, you have a
   place, chap. x. 5, where, speaking of Christ, he saith, "Wherefore
   coming into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest
   not have, but a body," etc.; where, seeing it is evident that he speaks
   of that world into which Jesus being entered was made our priest, as
   all the circumstances demonstrate, it appears that he speaks not of the
   present, but of the world to come, seeing, chap. viii. 4, he had said
   of Christ, "If he were on earth he should not be a priest." [300]

   The first two exceptions have been already cashiered; those which
   follow are of as little weight or consideration: for, --

   1. It is confessed that the word "world" hath in Scripture various
   acceptations, and is sometimes taken for men in the world; but that it
   can be so taken when the world is said to be made or created, when it
   is equivalent to all things, when it is proposed as a place whereunto
   One comes, and where he is, as is the state of the expression here,
   there can nothing more absurd or foolish be imagined.

   2. Heb i. 6 speaks not of the world to come, nor is there any place in
   the Scripture where the word "world" doth signify immortality or the
   world to come, nor any thing looking that way. Heb. ii. 5, mention is
   made not simply of the world, but of the "world to come;" nor doth that
   expression of the apostle relate unto that of chap. i. 6, where the
   word "world" is used, but to what goes before and after in the same
   chapter, where the thing itself is insisted on in other terms. Nor is
   future immortality intended there, by the "world to come," but the
   present state of the Christian church, called the "world to come," in
   reference to that of the Jews, which was past in that use of speech
   whereby it was expressed before it came; as also chap. vi. 5. Nor is
   the "world to come" life eternal or blessed immortality; life is to be
   had in it, but "immortality" and the "world to come" are not the same.
   Nor is that world ever said to be made, nor is it anywhere described as
   made already, but as to come: as Matt. xii. 32; Luke xviii. 30, xx. 35;
   Eph. i. 21. Nor can it be said of the world to come that it knew not
   Christ, as it is of this that he made; nor can Christ be said to come
   into that world in the beginning, which he did not until after his
   resurrection; nor is the world to come that whereof it is said in the
   next verse, which expounds this, "He came, eis ta idia," "to his own,"
   for then "his own," hoi idioi, "knew him not." So that there is not the
   least colour or pretence of this foppery that here they would evade the
   testimony of the Holy Ghost withal.

   3. These words, Heb. x. 5, "Coming into the world, he saith," etc., do
   not in the least intimate any thing of the world to come, but express
   the present world, into which Christ came when God prepared a body for
   him at his incarnation and birth; which was in order to the sacrifice
   which he afterward offered in this world, as shall be evidently
   manifested when we come to the consideration of the priesthood of
   Christ.

   It remains only that we hear their sense of these words, which they
   give as followeth:--

   Q. But what dost thou understand by these words, "The world was made by
   him"?

   A. A twofold sense may be given of them: -- First, that human kind was
   reformed by Christ, and as it were made again, because he brought life,
   and that eternal, to human kind, which was lost, and was subject to
   eternal death (which also John upbraideth the world withal, which being
   vindicated by Christ from destruction acknowledged him not, but
   contemned and rejected him); for that is the manner of the Hebrew
   speech, that in such terms of speaking, the words to "make" and
   "create" are as much as to "make again" or to "create again," because
   that tongue wants those words that are called compounds. The latter
   sense is, that that immortality which we expect is, as to us, made by
   Christ; as the same is called "the world to come" in respect of us,
   although it be present to Christ and the angels." [301]

   1. That these expositions are destructive to one another is evident,
   and yet which of them to adhere unto our catechists know not, such good
   builders are they for to establish men in the faith. Pull down they
   will, though they have nothing to offer in the room of what they
   endeavour to destroy.

   2. That the latter sense is not intended was before evinced. The world
   that was made in the beginning, into which Christ came, in which he
   was, which knew him not, which is said to be made, is a world, is not
   immortality or life eternal; nor is there any thing in the context that
   should in the least give countenance to such an absurd gloss.

   3. Much less is the first sense of the words tolerable; for, --

   (1.) It is expressly contradictory to the text. "He made the world,"
   that is, he reformed it; and, "The world knew him not," when the world
   is not reformed but by the knowledge of him!

   (2.) To be made doth nowhere simply signify to be renewed or reformed,
   unless it be joined with other expressions restraining its significancy
   to such renovation.

   (3.) The world was not renewed by Christ whilst he was in it; nor can
   it be said to be renewed by him only on the account of laying the
   foundation of its renovation in his doctrine. "?By him the world was
   made;' that is, he preached that doctrine whereby some in the world
   were to be reformed." The world that Christ made knew him not; but the
   renewed world know him.

   4. The Hebraism of "making" for "re-forming" is commonly pretended,
   without any instance for its confirmation. John wrote in Greek, which
   language abounds with compositions above any other in the world, and
   such as on all occasions he makes use of.

   There is one passage more that gives strength to the testimony insisted
   on, confirming the existence of Christ in his divine nature
   antecedently to his incarnation, and that is verse 14, "The Word was
   made flesh." Who the Word is, and what, we have heard. He who was in
   the beginning, who was God, and was with God, who made all things, who
   made the world, in whom was light and life, he was made flesh, --
   flesh, so as that thereupon he dwelt amongst men, and conversed with
   them. How he was, and how he was said to be, made flesh, I have
   declared in the consideration of his eternal sonship, and shall not
   again insist thereon. This, after the interposition of sundry
   questions, our catechists take thus into consideration:--

   Q. How do they prove Christ to have been incarnate

   A. From those testimonies where, according to their translation, it is
   read, "The Word was made flesh," John i. 14, etc.

   Q. How dost thou answer it?

   A. On this account, because in that testimony it is not said (as they
   speak) God was incarnate, or the divine nature assumed the human. "The
   Word was made flesh" is one thing, and God was incarnate, or the divine
   nature assumed the human, another. Besides, these words, "The Word was
   made flesh," or rather, "The Speech was made flesh," may and ought to
   be rendered, "The Word was flesh." That it may be so rendered appears
   from the testimonies in which the word egeneto (which is here
   translated "was made") is found rendered by the word" was," as in this
   chapter, verse 6, and Luke xxiv. 19, etc. Also, that it ought to be so
   rendered the order of John's words teacheth, who should have spoken
   very inconveniently, "The Word was made flesh," -- that is, as our
   adversaries interpret it, the divine nature assumed the human, -- after
   he had spoken those things of the Word which followed the nativity of
   the man Christ Jesus; such as are these, "John bare witness of him;"
   "he came into the world;" "he was not received of his own;" that "to
   them that received him, he gave power to become the sons of God." [302]

   This is the last plea they use in this case. The dying groans of their
   perishing cause are in it, which will provide them neither with succour
   nor relief; for, --

   1. It is not words or expressions that we contend about, Grant the
   thing pleaded for, and we will not contend with any living about the
   expressions wherein it is by any man delivered. By the "incarnation of
   the Son of God," and by the "divine nature assuming the human," we
   intend no more than what is here asserted, -- the Word, who was God,
   was made flesh.

   2. All they have to plead to the thing insisted on is, that the word
   egeneto may, yea ought to be, translated fuit, "was," and not factus
   est, "was made." But, --

   (1.) Suppose it should be translated "was," what would it avail them?
   He that was a man was made a man. In that sense it expresses what he
   was, but withal denotes how he came so to be. He who was the Word
   before was also a man. Let them show us any other way how he became so
   but only by being made so, and, upon a supposition of this new
   translation, they may obtain something. But, --

   (2.) How will they prove that it may be so much as rendered by fuit,
   "was." They tell you it is so in two other places in the New Testament;
   but doth that prove that it may so much as be so rendered here? The
   proper sense and common usage of it is, "was made," and because it is
   once or twice used in a peculiar sense, may it be so rendered here,
   where nothing requires that it be turned aside from its most usual
   acceptation, yea much enforcing it thereunto?

   (3.) That it ought to be rendered by fuit, "was," they plead the
   mentioning before of things done after Christ's incarnation (as we call
   it), so that it cannot be "He was made flesh." But, --

   [1.] Will they say that this order is observed by the apostle, -- that
   that which is first done is first expressed as to all particulars?
   What, then, becomes of their interpretation who say "The Word was made
   God by his exaltation, and made flesh in his humiliation?" and yet how
   much is that which in their sense was last expressed before that which
   went before it? Or will they say, in him was the life of man before he
   was made flesh, when the life of man, according to them, depends on his
   resurrection solely, which was after he ceased to be flesh in their
   sense? Or what conscience have these men, who in their disputes will
   object that to the interpretation of others which they must receive and
   embrace for the establishing of their own?

   [2.] The order of the words is most proper. John having asserted the
   deity of Christ, with some general concomitants and consequences of the
   dispensation wherein he undertakes to be a mediator, in his 14th verse
   enters particularly upon a description of his entrance upon his
   employment, and his carrying it on, by the revelation of the will of
   God; so that without either difficulty or straining, the sense and
   intendment of the Holy Ghost falls in clearly in the words.

   3. It is evident that the word neither may nor ought to be translated
   according to their desire; for, --

   (1.) It being so often said before that the Word was, the word is still
   en, and not egeneto. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
   with God, and the Word was God;" -- the same was. "He was in the world,
   he was the light;" -- still the same word. So that if no more were
   intended but what was before expressed, the terms would not be changed
   without exceedingly obscuring the sense; and therefore egeneto must
   signify somewhat more than en.

   (2.) The word egeneto, applied to other things in this very place,
   denotes their making or their original; which our catechists did not
   question in the consideration of the places where it is so used: as
   verse 3, "All things were made by him, and without him was not any
   thing made that was made;" and verse 10, "The world was made by him."

   (3.) This phrase is expounded accordingly in other places: as Rom. i.
   3, Tou genomenou ek spermatos Dabid kata sarka, -- "Made of the seed of
   David according to the flesh;" and Gal. iv. 4, Genomenon ek gunaikos,
   "Made of a woman." But they think to salve all by the ensuing
   exposition of these words:--

   Q. How is that to be understood, "The Word was flesh?"

   A. That he by whom God perfectly revealed all his will, who is
   therefore called "Sermo" by John, was a man, subject to all miseries
   and afflictions, and lastly to death itself: for the Scripture useth
   the word "flesh" in that sense, as is clear from those places where God
   speaks, "My Spirit shall not always contend with man, seeing he is
   flesh," Gen. vi. 3; and Peter, "All flesh is grass," 1 Pet. i. 24.
   [303]

   This is the upshot of our catechists' exposition of this first chapter
   of John, as to the person of Christ; which is, --

   1. Absurd, upon their own suppositions; for the testimonies produced
   affirm every man to be flesh, so that to say he is a man is to say he
   is flesh, and to say that man was flesh is to say that a man was a man,
   inasmuch as every man is flesh.

   2. False, and no way fitted to the intendment of the Holy Ghost; for he
   was made flesh antecedently to his dwelling amongst us; which
   immediately follows in the text. Nor is his being made flesh suited to
   any thing in this place but his conversation with men; which answers
   his incarnation, not his mediation; neither is this exposition
   confirmed by any instance from the Scriptures of the like expression
   used concerning Jesus Christ, as that we urge is, Rom. i. 3, Gal. iv.
   4, and other places. The place evidently affirms the Word to be made
   something that he was not before, when he was the Word only, and cannot
   be affirmed of him as he was man, in which sense he was always
   obnoxious to miseries and death.

   And this is all which our catechists, in several places, have thought
   meet to insist on, by way of exception or opposition to our undeniable
   and manifest testimonies from this first chapter of John unto the great
   and sacred truth contended for; which I have at large insisted on, that
   the reader from this one instance may take a taste of their dealing in
   the rest, and of the desperateness of the cause which they have
   undertaken, driving them to such desperate shifts for the maintenance
   and protection of it. In the residue I shall be more brief.

   John vi. 62 is in the next place taken into consideration. The words
   are, "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was
   before?" What we intend from hence, and the force of the argument from
   this testimony insisted on, will the better appear if we add unto it
   those other places of Scripture wherein the same thing is more
   expressly and emphatically affirmed; which our catechists cast (or some
   of them) quite into another place, on pretence of the method wherein
   they proceed, but indeed to take off from the evidence of the
   testimony, as they deal with what we plead from John i. The places I
   intend are:--

   John iii. 13, "And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came
   down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven." Verse 31,
   "He that cometh from above is above all: he that cometh from heaven is
   above all." Chap. viii. 23, "Ye are from beneath; I am from above."
   Chap. xvi. 28, "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the
   World: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."

   Hence we thus argue:-- He that was in heaven before he was on the
   earth, and who was also in heaven whilst he was on the earth, is the
   eternal God; but this doth Jesus Christ abundantly confirm concerning
   himself: therefore he is the eternal God, blessed for ever.

   In answer to the first place our catechists thus proceed:--

   Q. What answerest thou to the second testimony, John vi. 62?

   A. Neither is here any mention made expressly of pre-eternity; for in
   this place the Scripture witnesseth that the Son of man, that is a man,
   was in heaven, who without all controversy was not eternally
   pre-existent. [304]

   So they. 1. It is expressly affirmed that Christ was in heaven before
   his coming into the world. And if we evince his pre-existence to his
   incarnation against the Socinians, the task will not be difficult to
   prove that pre-existence to be in an eternal divine nature against the
   Arians. It is sufficient, as to our intendment in producing this
   testimony, that it is affirmed that Christ en proteron in heaven before
   his coming forth into the world; in what nature we elsewhere prove.

   2. It is said, indeed, that the Son of man was in heaven; which makes
   it evident that he who is the Son of man hath another nature besides
   that wherein he is the Son of man, wherein he is the Son of God. And by
   affirming that the Son of man was in heaven before, it doth no more
   assert that he was eternal and in heaven in that nature wherein he is
   the Son of man, than the affirmation that God redeemed his church with
   his own blood doth prove that the blood shed was the blood of the
   divine nature. Both the affirmations are concerning the person of
   Christ. As he who was God shed his blood as he was man, so he who was
   man was eternal and in heaven as he was God. So that the answer doth
   merely beg the thing in question, namely, that Christ is not God and
   man in one person.

   3. The insinuation here of Christ's being in heaven as man before his
   ascension mentioned in Scripture, shall be considered when we come to
   the proposal made of that figment by Mr B., in his chapter of the
   prophetical office of Christ. In answer to the other testimonies cited,
   they thus proceed, towards the latter end of their chapter concerning
   the person of Christ:--

   Q. What answerest thou to John iii. 13, x. 36, xvi. 28, xvii. 18?

   A. That a divine nature is not here proved appeareth, because the words
   of the first testimony. "He came down from heaven," may be received
   figuratively: as James i. 17, "Every good and every perfect gift is
   from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights;" and Rev. xxi.
   2, 10, "I saw the holy city Jerusalem coming down from God." But if the
   words be taken properly, which we willingly admit, it appears that they
   are not spoken of any other than the Son of man, who, seeing he hath
   necessarily a human person, cannot by nature be God. Moreover, for what
   the Scripture witnesseth of Christ, that the Father sent him into the
   world, the same we read of the apostles of Christ in the same words
   above alleged; as John xvii. 18, "As thou hast sent me into the world,
   I have sent them into the world." And these words, "Christ came forth
   from the Father," are of the same impart with "He descended from
   heaven." "To come into the world" is of that sort as the Scripture
   manifests to have been after the nativity of Christ, John xviii. 37,
   where the Lord himself says," For this I am born, and come into the
   world, that I might bear witness to the truth;" and 1 John iv. 1, it is
   written, "Many false prophets are gone forth into the world." Wherefore
   from this kind of speaking a divine nature in Christ cannot be proved;
   but in all these speeches only what was the divine original of the
   office of Christ is described. [305]

   1. That these expressions are merely figuratively to be expounded they
   dare not assert; nor is there any colour given that they may be so
   received from the instances produced from James i. 17 and Rev. xxi. 2,
   10; for there is only mention made of descending or coming down, which
   word we insist not on by itself, but as it is conjoined with the
   testimony of his being in heaven before his descending, which takes off
   all pretence of a parity of reason in the places compared.

   2. All that follows is a perfect begging of the thing in question.
   Because Christ is the Son of man, it follows that he is a true man, but
   not that he hath the personality of a man, or a human personality.
   Personality belongs not to the essence but to the existence of a man.
   So that here they do but repeat their own hypothesis in answer to an
   express testimony of Scripture against it Their confession of the
   proper use of the word is but to give colour to the figment formerly
   intimated; which shall be in due place (God assisting) discovered.

   3. They utterly omit and take no notice of that place where Christ says
   he so came from heaven as that he was still in heaven; nor do they
   mention any thing of that which we lay greatest weight on, -- of his
   affirming that he was in heaven before, -- but merely insist on the
   word "descending" or "coming down;" and yet they can no other way deal
   with that neither but by begging the thing in question.

   4. We do not argue merely from the words of Christ's being sent into
   the world, but in this conjunct consideration that he was so sent into
   the world as that he was in heaven before, and so came forth from the
   Father, and was with him in heaven before his coming forth; and this
   our catechists thought good to oversee.

   5. The difference of Christ's being sent into the world, and the
   apostles by him, which they parallel as to the purpose in hand, lies in
   this, that Christ was so sent of the Father that he came forth from the
   Father, and was with him in heaven before his sending; which proves him
   to have another nature than that wherein he was sent, The similitude
   alleged consists quite in other things. Neither, --

   6. Doth the scripture in John xviii. 37 testify that Christ's sending
   into the world was after his nativity, but only that the end of them
   both was to "bear witness to the truth," And, indeed, "I was born," and
   "came into the world," are but the same, the one being exegetical of
   the other. But his being born and his coming into the world are, in the
   testimonies cited, plainly asserted in reference to an existence that
   he had in heaven before. And thus as our argument is not at all touched
   in this answer, so is their answer closed as it began, with the begging
   of that which is not only questioned but sufficiently disproved, --
   namely, that Christ was, in his human nature, taken up into heaven and
   instructed in the will of God before his entrance upon his prophetical
   office.

   And this is the whole of what they have to except against this evident
   testimony of the divine nature of Christ. He was in heaven with the
   Father before he came forth from the Father, or was sent into the
   world, and kata allo kai allo, was in heaven when he was on the earth,
   and at his ascension returned thither where he was before. And so much
   for the vindication of this second testimony.

   John vi. 62 is the second place I can meet with, in all the annotations
   of Grotius, wherein he seems to assert the union of the human nature of
   Christ with the eternal Word, -- if he do so. It is not with the man
   that I have any difference, nor do I impose any thing on him for his
   judgment; I only take liberty, having so great cause given, to discuss
   his Annotations.

   There remains one more of the first rank, as they are sorted by our
   catechists, for the proof of the eternity of Christ, which is also from
   John, chap. viii. 58, "Before Abraham was, I am," that they insist
   on:--

   In this place the pre-eternity of Christ is not only not expressed,
   seeing it is one thing to be before Abraham, and another to be eternal,
   but also, it is not so much as expressed that he was before the Virgin
   Mary. For these words may otherwise be read, namely, "Verily, verily, I
   say unto you, Before Abraham was made, I am;" as it appears from those
   places in the same evangelist where the like Greek phrase is used,
   chap. xiii. 19, xiv. 29.

   Q. What then would be the sense of this reading?

   A. Very eminent. For Christ admonisheth the Jews, who would have
   ensnared him in his speech, that whilst they had time, they should
   believe in him as the light of the world, before the divine grace which
   Christ offered to them should be taken from them and be carried to the
   Gentiles. But that these words, "I am," are to be supplied in that
   manner as if himself had added to them, "I am the light of the world,"
   appears, because that in the beginning of his speech, verse 12, he had
   twice in these words, "I am," called himself the light of the world,
   verses 24, 28. And that these words, "Before Abraham be," do signify
   that which we have said, may be perceived from the notation of that
   word "Abraham;" for it is evident that "Abraham" denotes "the father of
   many nations." Seeing, then, that Abram was not made Abraham before the
   grace of God manifested in Christ redounded to many nations, for
   Abraham before was the father of one nation only, it appears that that
   is the very sense of the words which we have given. [306]

   If our adversaries can well quit themselves of this evidence, I believe
   they will have no small hopes of escaping in the whole trial; and if
   they meet with judges so partially addicted to them and their cause as
   to accept of such manifest juggling and perverting of the Scriptures, I
   know not what they may not expect or hope for, especially seeing how
   they exult and triumph in this invention, as may be seen in the words
   of Socinus himself in his answer to Erasmus Johannes, p. 67. For
   whereas Erasmus says, "I confess in my whole life I never met with any
   interpretation of Scripture more wrested, or violently perverting the
   sense of it;" the other replies, "I hoped rather that thou wouldst
   confess that in thy whole life thou hadst never heard an interpretation
   more acute and true than this, nor which did savour more of somewhat
   divine, or evidenced more clearly its revelation from God. I truly have
   not light conjectures that he who brought it first to light in our age
   (now this was he who in this age renewed the opinion of the original of
   Christ, which I constantly defend)" (that is, his uncle Lælius)
   "obtained it of Christ by many prayers. This truly I do affirm, that
   whereas God revealed many things to that man at that time altogether
   unknown to others, yet there is scarce any thing amongst them all that
   may seem more divine than this interpretation." [307]

   Of this esteem is this interpretation of these words with them. They
   profess it to be one of the best and most divine discoveries that ever
   was made by them; whereto, for my part, I freely assent, though withal
   I believe it to be as violent a perverting of the Scripture and
   corrupting of the word of God as the world can bear witness to.

   Let the Christian reader, without the least prejudicial thought from
   the interpretation of this or that man, consult the text and context.
   The head of the discourse which gives occasion to these words of Christ
   concerning himself lies evidently and undeniably in verse 51, "Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see
   death." Upon this the Jews rise up against him, as one that boasted of
   himself above measure, and preferred himself before his betters: Verse
   52, "Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
   Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my
   saying, he shall never taste of death;" and, verse 53, "Art thou
   greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are
   dead: whom makest thou thyself?" Two things are here charged on him by
   the Jews: First, in general, That he preferred, exalted, and honoured
   himself. Secondly, in particular, That he made himself better than
   Abraham their father. To both which charges Christ answers in order in
   the following words. 1. To the first or general charge of honouring
   himself: Verses 54, 55, "Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour
   is nothing: it is my Father that honoreth me; of whom ye say, that he
   is your God. Ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should
   say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him,
   and keep his saying." His honour he had from God, whom they professed
   [to know,] but knew not. 2. To that of Abraham he replies, verse 56,
   "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was
   glad;" -- "Though Abraham was so truly great, and the friend of God,
   yet his great joy was from his belief in me, whereby he saw my day." To
   this the Jews reply, labouring to convince him of a falsehood, from the
   impossibility of the thing that he had asserted, verse 57, "Thou art
   not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?" -- "Abraham was
   dead so many hundred years before thou wast born, how couldst thou see
   him, or he thee?" To this, in the last place, our Saviour replies,
   verse 58, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am."
   The Jews knowing that by these words he asserted his deity, and that it
   was impossible on any other account to make good that he, who in their
   esteem was not fifty years old (indeed but a little above thirty),
   should be before Abraham, as in a case of blasphemy, they take up
   stones to stone him, verse 59, as was their perpetual manner, to
   attempt to kill him under pretence of blasphemy, when he asserted his
   deity; as John v. 18, "Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him,
   because he said that God was his Father, making himself equal with
   God."

   This naked and unprejudicate view of the text is sufficient to obviate
   all the operose and sophistical exceptions of our catechists, so that I
   shall not need long to insist upon them. That which we have asserted
   may be thus proposed: He who in respect of his human nature was many
   hundred years after Abraham, yet was in another respect existing before
   him; he had an existence before his birth, as to his divine nature. Now
   this doth Christ expressly affirm concerning himself; and nothing else
   is pretended but only his divine nature wherein he should so exist.
   They say, then, --

   1. That these words do not signify pre-eternity, but only something
   before Abraham. It is enough that his existence so many hundred years
   before his nativity is evidently asserted; his eternity from thence
   will evidently be concluded; and they will not deny that he may as well
   be eternal as be before Abraham. But, --

   2. The words may be rendered, "Priusquam Abraham fiat, ego sum,"
   "Before Abraham be made." But that they may be so rendered is no proof
   at all that they ought to be so; and, as was before observed, if this
   be sufficient to evade the sense of a place, that any word in it may be
   otherwise rendered, because it is or may be so in some other place,
   nothing certain can be concluded from any testimony of the Scriptures
   whatever. But that they may not be so rendered is evident, -- (1.) From
   the context, as before declared; (2.) From the opposition between ego
   eimi, "I am," and "Abraham was," which evidently denotes a time past,
   as it stands in comparison with what Christ says of himself; and, (3.)
   The words in such a construction as this require an interpretation as
   to the time past; and, (4.) Because this interpretation of the words
   corrupts the whole sense of the place, and wrests it contrary to the
   design and intendment of our Saviour. But then they say, --

   3. "The sense is excellent; for Before Abraham be made' is as much as
   before he be Abraham, or the father of many nations, which he was when
   the gospel was preached to the conversion of the Gentiles. I am,' that
   is, I am the light of the world,' which you should do well to walk in
   and attend unto."

   (1.) That this interpretation in general is altogether alien and
   strange from the scope of the place, the Christian reader, upon the
   bare view of it, will be able to judge. (2.) It is false:-- [1.]
   Because Abraham was the father of many nations, Jews and proselytes,
   before the preaching of the gospel, as Gen. xv. 5. [2.] It is false
   that Abram was not Abraham until after the ascension of Christ and
   preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, He was made Abraham from his
   first enjoyment of his name and seed in Isaac, and is constantly so
   called. [3.] It is frivolous; for if Christ was before Abram was made
   Abraham, we obtain what we plead for, for he was made so when God gave
   him that name. But it should be, "Before Abram be made Abraham," or
   there is no sense in the words; nor then neither, unless Abraham be
   taken as a common appellative for "the father of many nations," and not
   as a proper name, whereof in Scripture there is not any example. [4.]
   It is horribly wrested, -- 1st. In making the words "I am" elliptical,
   whereas there is neither need of nor colour for such a pretence. 2dly.
   In supplying the feigned ellipsis with a word at such a distance as
   from verse 12 to verse 58. 3dly. In making Christ to say he is the
   light of the world before the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles,
   when the "world" is everywhere in the gospel taken quite in another
   sense, for the Jews and Gentiles, and not for the Jews only, which
   according to this interpretation it must be. 4thly. It leaves no reason
   of the following attempt of the Jews to stone him, upon the particular
   provocation of this assertion, he having before affirmed himself to be
   the light of the world, which they were not moved at. There is indeed
   no end of the falsities, follies, and corruptions of this perverting
   and corrupting of the word of God.

   For the grammatical vindication of the words, and the translation of
   the word genesthai in a sense of that which is past, there is no
   occasion administered by our catechists; and therefore I shall not
   trouble the reader therewith.

   And of the first sort of testimonies which they except against, and
   their exceptions, thus far.

   A little animadversion upon the catechists' good friend Grotius shuts
   up this discourse and chapter. In the end he agrees with them, but
   fixes on a new medium for the accomplishment of it, not daring to
   espouse an interpretation so absurd in itself, and so abhorrent from
   the common sense of all men that ever professed the name of Christ. He
   takes, then, another course, yet no less aiming than they to disappoint
   this evidence of the pre- existence of Christ before his nativity. Prin
   abraam genesthai, antequam esset, saith he, "before he was;" and he
   gives many instances to prove the propriety of so translating that
   expression: "?Ego eimi, præsens pro imperfecto, eram, Syrus; Ego pelon,
   Nonnus. Sic in Græco: Ps. xc. 2, Pro tou genethenai su hei." Very good:
   before Abraham was, or was born, Christ was; as in that of the psalm,
   "Before the mountains were made, thou art." And, a little to help a
   friend at so good a work, it is no new thing for this evangelist to use
   the present for the preterimperfect tense; as chap. xiv. 9, Tosouton
   chronon meth humon eimi kai ouk egnokas me -- "I am so long," for "I
   was," or "I have been so long with you," etc. And chap. xv. 27, Hoti ap
   arches met emou este -- "Because ye have been with me from the
   beginning." Thus far, then, we are agreed. But how should this be, that
   Christ thus was before Abraham was? "Fuerat," saith he, "autem ante
   Abrabarnum Jesus divina constitutione;" -- "In God's appointment Jesus
   was before Abraham was born." Yea, and so was Grotius, and Socinus, and
   every man in the world; for "known unto God are all his works from the
   beginning of the world." And this is that great privilege, it seems,
   that our Saviour vindicates to himself, without any occasion, to no
   purpose, insisting on that which is common to him with all the elect of
   God in the best sense of the words! Of that other text of Scripture,
   John xvii. 5, which together with this he labours to corrupt, I shall
   speak afterward. I shall only add, that our great doctors do not in
   this business agree. Grotius here makes no mention of Socinus' gloss,
   and Socinus beforehand rejects this of Grotius as absurd and fond; and
   as such let it pass, as having no occasion given from the words
   foregoing, nor colour from the matter or phrase of words, nor
   significancy to the business in hand.

   quædam ad illius munus referri, quæ te scire oportet."Quænam ea sunt
   quæ ad personam ipsius referuntur? -- Id solum, quod natura sit homo
   verus, quemadmodum ea de re crebro Scripturæ sacræ testautur, inter
   alias, 1 Tim. ii. 5, et 1 Cor. xv. 21; qualem olim Deus per prophetas
   promiserat, et qualem etiam esse testatur fidei symbolum, quod vulgo
   Apostolicum vocant, quod nobiscum universi Christiani amplectuntur."

   [288] "Ergo Dominus Jesus est purus homo? -- Nullo pacto; etenim est
   conceptus e Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine, eoque ab ipsa
   conceptione et ortu Filius Dei est, ut ea de re Luc. i. 35 legimus, ubi
   angelus Mariam ira alloquitur, Spiritus Sanctus superveniet in te,
   etc., ut alias causas non afferam, quas postmodum in Jesu Christi
   persona deprehendes, quæ evidentisaime ostendunt Dominum Jesum pro pure
   homine nullo modo accipi posse."

   [289] "Dixeras paulo superius Dominum Jesum natura esse hominem; an
   idem habet naturam divinam? -- Nequaquam; nam id non solum rationi
   sanæ, verum etiam divinis literis repugnat."

   [290] "Cedo qui rationi sanæ repugnat? -- Primo, ad eum modum, quod duæ
   substantiæ, proprietatibus adversæ, coire in unam personam nequeant; ut
   sunt mortalem et immortalem esse, principium habere et principio
   carere, mutabilem et immutabilem existere. Deinde, quod dues natures,
   personam singulæ constituentes, in unam personam convenire itidem
   nequeant; nam loco unius duas personas esse operteret, atque ita duos
   Christos existere, quem unum esse, et unam ipsius personam omnes citra

   [291] "Cum vero illi ostendunt, Christum sic ex natura divina et humana
   constare, quemadmodum homo ex animo et corpore constet, quid illis
   respondendum? -- Permagnum hic esse discrimen; illi enim aiunt, duas
   naturas in Christo ita unitas esse, ut Christus sit Deus et homo. Anima
   vero et corpus ad eum modum in homine conjuneta sunt, ut nec anima nec
   corpus ipse homo sit, nec enim anima nec corpus sigillatim personam
   constituunt. At ut natura divina per se constituit personam, ita humana
   constituat per se necesse est."

   [292] "Doce etiam, qui id repugnet Scripturæ Christum habere divinam
   naturam. -- Primum, ea ratione, quod Scriptura nobis unum tantum natura
   Deum proponat, quem superius demonstravimus esse Christi Patrem.
   Secundo, eadem Scriptura testatur, Jesum Christum natura esse hominem,
   ut superius ostensum est; quo ipso illi naturam adimit divinam. Tertio,
   quod quicquid divinum Christus habeat, Scriptura eum Patris dono habere
   aperte doceat, Matt. xxviii. 18; Phil. ii. 9; 1 Cor. xv. 27; John v.
   19, x. 25. Denique cum eadem Scriptura apertissime ostendat, Jesum
   Christum omnia sua facta divina non sibi, nec alicui naturæ divinæ suæ,
   sed Patri suo vindicare solitum fuisse, planum facit, eam divinam in
   Christo naturam prorsus otiosam, ac sine omni causa futuram fuisse."

   [293] "Atqui illi e Scripturis illam divinam in Christo naturam
   asserere conantur? -- Conantur quidem variis modis; idque dum student
   aut e scripturis quibusdam evincere quæ in iis non habentur, aut dum ex
   iis quæ in scripturis habentur perperam ratiocinantur, ac male rem suam
   conficiunt."

   [294] "Quæ vero sunt ilia quæ illi de Christo e Scripturis evincere
   laborant quæ illic non habentur? -- Est illius, ut loquuntur,
   prææternitas, quam duplici scripturarum genere approbare nituntur.
   Primum ejusmodi est, in quo præ-æternitatem hanc expressam putant.
   Secundum, in quo licet expressa non sit, earn tamen colligi
   arbitrantur."

   [295] "Quænam sunt testimonia Scripturæ quæ videntur ipsis eam
   præ-æternitatem exprimere? -- Sunt ea in quibus Scriptura testatur de
   Christo, ipsum fuisse in principio, fuisse in coelo, fuisse ante
   Abrahamum, Joh. i. 1, vi. 62, viii. 58."

   [296] "Quid vero ad primum respendes? -- In loco citato nihil habetur
   de ista præ-æternitate, cum hic principii mentio fiat, quod
   præ-æternitati oppenitur. Principii vero vox in Scripturis fere semper
   ad subjectam refertur materiam, ut videre est, Dan. viii. 1; John xv.
   27, xvi. 4; Acts xi. 15: cum igitur hic subjecta sit materia

   sit multa extare, quæ nova facta non sunt. Cum veto subjecta apud
   Johannem materia sit evangelium, apparet vocem omnia de iis omnibus quæ
   quoquo modo ad evangelium pertinent accipi debere."Cur vero addidit
   Johannes, quod sine eo factum est nihil quod factum est? -- Addidit hæc
   Johannes, ut eo melius illustraret illa superiora, Omnia per ipsum
   facta sunt, quæ eam vim habere videntur, per solum Verbum vel Filium
   Dei omnia illa facta esse, licet ejus generis qædem, et quidem magni
   momenti, non per ipsum, verum per apostolos facta fuerint, -- ut est
   vocatio Gentium, et legalium ceremoniarum abolitio: licet enim hæc
   originem ab ipsis sermonibus et operibus Domini Jesu traxerint, ad
   effectum tamen non sunt perducta per ipsum Christum, sed per ipsius
   apostolos, non tamen sine ipso; apostoli enim omnia nomine et
   authoritate ipsius administrarunt, ut etiam ipse Dominus ait, Sine me
   nihil facere potestis, Joh. xv. 5."

   [300] "Quid vero respondes ad secundum? -- Primum, quod hic non scribat
   Johannes mundum esse creatum, sed factum. Deinde, eo loquendi mode
   utitur, qui mediam causam designat, ait enim, mundum per eum factum.
   Denique, hæc vox mundus, quemadmodum et aliæ quæ prorsus idem in
   Scripturis valent, non solum coelum et terram denotat, verum præter
   alias significationes, vel genus humanum designat, un locus præsens
   ostendit, ubi ait, In mundo erat, et mundus eum non agnovit, John i.
   10, et Mundus eum secutus est, John xii. 19, aut etiam futuram
   immortalitatem, ut apparet, Heb. i. 6, ubi ait, Et eum iterum
   introducit primogenitum in mundum, ait, Et adorent cum omnes angeli
   Dei, quod de futuro mundo accipi apparet e cap. ii. ejusdem epistolæ,
   ubi ait, Etenim non angelis subjecit mundum futurum, de quo loquimur,
   at nusquam de eo locutus fuerat, nisi ver. 6, cap. i. Præterea, habes
   locum, cap. x. ver. 5, ubi de Christo loquens, ait, Propterea
   ingrediens in mundum, ait, Hostiam et oblationem noluisti, verum corpus
   adaptasti mihi; ubi cum palam sit eum loqui de mundo in quem ingressus
   Jesus, sacerdos noster factus est (ut circumstantiæ omnes demonstrant)
   apparet, non de præsenti, sed de futuro mundo agi, quandoquidem, cap.
   viii. ver. 4, de Christo dixerat, Si in terris esset, ne sacerdos
   quidem esset."

   [301] "Quid vero per hæc, Mundus per cum factus est, intelligis? Duplex
   eorum sensus dari potest: Prior, quod genus humanum per Christum
   reformatum, et quasi denuo factum sit, eo quod ille generi humano, quod
   perierat, et æternæ morti subjectum erat, vitam attulit, eamque
   sempiternam (quod etiam mundo Johannes exprobrat, qui per Christum ab
   interitu vindicatus, eum non agnoverit, sed spreverit et rejecerit); is
   enim mos Hebraici sermonis, quod in ejusmodi loquendi modis, verba
   facere, creare, idem valeant, quod denuo facere, et denuo creare, idque
   propterea, quod verbis quæ composita vocant ea lingua careat. Posterior
   vero sensus est, quod illa immortalitas quam expectamus per Christum,
   quantum ad nos, facta sit; quemadmodum eadem futurum sæculum, habita
   ratione nostri, vocatur, licet jam Christo et angelis sit præsens."

   [302] "E quibus vero testimoniis Scripturæ demonstrate conantur
   Christum (ut loquuntur) incarnatum esse? -- Ex iis ubi secundum eorum
   versionem legitur Verbum caro factum ease, Job i. 14; Phil. ii. 6, 7; 1
   Tim. iii. 16, etc."Quomodo ad primum respondes? -- Ea ratione, quod in
   eo testimonio non habeatur Deum (ut loquuntur) incarnatum ease, aut
   quod natura divina assumpserit humanam. Aliud enim est, Verbum caro
   factum est, aliud, Deus incarnatus est (ut loquuntur) vel natura divina
   assumpsit humanam. Præterea, hæc verba, Verbum caro factum est, vel
   potius, Sermo caro factus est, possunt et debent ita reddi, Sermo caro
   fuit. Posse its reddi, e testimoniis in quibus vox egeneto (quæ hic per
   factum est translata est) verbo fuit reddita invenitur, apparet; ut in
   eodem cap., ver. 6, et Luc. xxiv. 19: Fuit homo missus a Deo, etc.; et,
   Qui fuit vir propheta, etc. Debere vero reddi per verbum fuit, ordo
   verborum Johannis docet, qui valde inconvenienter loquutas fuisset,
   Sermonem carnem factum esse, -- id est, ut adversarii interpretantur,
   naturam divinam assumpsisse humanam, -- postquam ea jam de illo Sermone
   exposuisset, quæ nativitatem hominis Jesu Christi subsecuta sunt: ut
   sunt hæc, Johannem Baptistam de illo testatum esse; illum in mundo
   fuisse; a suis non fuisse receptum; quod iis, a quibus receptus
   fuisset, potestatem dederit, ut filii Dei fierent."

   [303] "Qua ratione illud intelligendum est, Sermonem carnem fuisse? --
   Quod is per quem Deus voluntatem suam omnem perfecte exposuisset, et
   propterea a Johanne Sermo appellatus fuisset, homo fuerit, omnibus
   miseriis et affiictionibus, ac morti denique subjectus: etenim vocem
   caro eo sensu Scriptura usurpat, ut ex iis locis perspicuum est, ubi
   Deus loquitur, Non contendet Spiritus meus cum homine in æternum, quia
   caro est, Gen. vi. 3; et Petrus, Omnis caro ut foenum, 1 Pet. i. 24."

   [304] "Ad secundum autem quid respondes? -- Neque hic ullam
   præ-æternitatis mentionem factam expresse; nam hoc in loco Filium
   hominis, id est, hominem in coelis fuisse testatur Sriptura, quem citra
   ullam controversiam præ-æternum non extitisse certum est."

   [305] "Ubi vero Scriptura de Christo ait, quod de coelo descendit, a
   Patre exivit, et in mundum venit, John iii. 13, x. 36, xvi. 28, xvii.
   18, quid ad hæc respondes? -- Ex iis non probari divinam naturam hinc
   apparere, quod primi testimonii verba, Descendit de coelo, possint
   figurate accipi; quemadmodum, Jac. i. 17, Omne datum bonum et donum
   perfectum desursum est, descendens a Patre luminum; et Rev. xxi. 2, 10,
   Vidi civitatem sanctam, Hierusalem novam, descendentem de coelo a Deo,
   etc. Quod si proprie æcipi debeant, quod nos perlibenter admittimus,
   apparet non de alio illa dicta quam de Filio hominis, qui cum personam
   humanam necessario habeat, Deus natura esse non potest. Porro, quod
   Scriptura testatur de Christo, quod Pater eum miserit in mundum, idem
   de apostolis Christi legimus in iisdem verbis citatis superius:
   Quemadmodum me misisti in mundum, et ego misi eos in mundum, John xvii.
   18. Ea veto verba, quod Christusm a Patre exierit, idem valent, quod de
   coelo descendit. Venire vero in mundum, id ejusmodi est, quod Scriptura
   post nativitatem Christi extitisse ostendit, Joh. xviii. 37, ubi ipse
   Dominus ait, Ego in hoc natus sum, et in mundum vent ut testimonium
   perhibeam veritati; et 1 John iv. 1, scriptum est, Multos falsos
   prophetas exiisse in mundum. Quare ex ejusmodi loquendi modis natura
   divina in Christo probari non potest. In omnibus vero his locutionibus,
   quam divinum muneris Christi principium fuerit, duntaxat deseribitur."

   [306] "In hoc loco non solum non exprinfitur præ-æternitas Christi, cum
   aliud sit, ante Abrahamum fuisse, aliud, præ-æternum; verum ne hoc
   quidem expressum est, ipsum ante Mariam Virginem fuisse. Et enim ea
   verba aliter legi posse (nimirum hac ratione, Amen, amen, dico vobis,
   Priusquam Abraham fiat, ego sum) apparet ex iis locis apud eundem
   evangelistam, ubi similis et eadem locutio Græca habetur, cap. xiii.
   19, Et modo dico vobis, priusquam fiat, ut cum factum fuerit credatis;
   et cap. xiv. 29, Et nunc dixi vobis usquam fiat, etc."Quæ vero ejus
   sententia foret lectionis? -- Admodum egregia: etenim admonet Christus
   Judæos, qui eum in sermone capere volebant, ut dum tempus haberent,
   crederent ipsum esse mundi lucem, antequam divina gratia, quam Christus
   iis offerebat, ab iis tolleretur, et ad Gentes transferretur. Quod vero
   ea verba, ego sum, sint ad sum modum supplenda, ac si ipse subjecisset
   iis, Ego sum lux mundi, superius e principio ejus orationis, ver. 12,
   constat et hinc, quod Christus bis seipsum iisdem verbis, ego sum,
   lucem mundi vocaveritm, ver. 24, 28. Ea vero verba, Priusquam Abraham
   fiat, id significare quod diximus, e notatione nominis Abraham
   deprehendi potest; constat inter omnes Abrahamum notare patrem multarum
   gentium. Cum vero Abram non sit factus prius Abraham, quam Dei gratia,
   in Christo manifestata, in multas gontes redundaret, quippe quod
   Abrahamus unins tantum gentis antes pater fuerit, apparet sententiara
   horum verborum, quam attulimus, esse ipsissimam."

   [307] "Fateor me per omnem vitam meam non magis contortam scripturæ
   interpretationem audivisse; ideoque eam penitus improbo." -- Eras.
   Johan. "Cum primum fatendi verbum in tuis verbis animadverti, sperabam
   to potius nuliam in tua vita scripturæ interpretationem audivisse, quæ
   hac sit acutior aut verior; quæque magis divinum quid sapiat, et a Deo
   ipso patefactum fuisse præ se ferat. Ego quidem certe non leves
   conjecturas habeo, ilium, qui primus setate nostra eam in lucem
   pertulit (hic autem is fuit, qui primus quoque sententiam de Christi
   origine, quam ego constanter defendo renovavit) precibus multis ab ipso
   Christo impetrasse. Hoc profecto affirmare ausim, cum Deus illi viro
   permulta, aliia prorsus tunc temporis incognita, patefecerit, vix
   quidquam inter ilia omnia esse quod interpretatione hac divinius videri
   queat." -- Socin. Disput. cum Eras. Johan. arg. 4, p. 67.

Chapter IX.

   The pre-eternity of Christ farther evinced -- Sundry texts of Scripture
   vindicated.

   In the consideration of the ensuing testimonies, I shall content myself
   with more brief observations upon and discoveries of the corruptions of
   our adversaries, having given a large testimony thereof in the chapter
   foregoing. Thus, then, they proceed:--

   Ques. What are the testimonies of Scripture wherein they think that
   this pre-eternity of Christ is not indeed expressed, but yet may thence
   be proved?

   Ans. Those which seem to attribute to the Lord Jesus some things from
   eternity, and some things in a certain and determinate time. [308]

   Let the gentlemen take their own way and method; we shall meet with
   them at the first stile, or rather brazen wall, which they endeavour to
   climb over.

   Q. What are the testimonies which seem to attribute some things to the
   Lord Jesus from eternity?

   A. They are those from which they endeavour to confirm that Christ was
   begotten from eternity of the essence of his Father. [309]

   These are some of the places wherein this property of the Godhead,
   eternity, is ascribed to our Saviour, it is confessed.

   Q. But from what places do they endeavour to prove that Christ was from
   eternity begotten of the essence of his Father?

   A. From these chiefly, Mic. v. 2; Ps. ii. 7, Ps. cx. 3; Prov. viii. 23.
   [310]

   1. These are only some of the testimonies that are used to this
   purpose. 2. It is enough to prove Christ eternal if we prove him
   begotten of his Father, for no such thing can be new in God. 3. That he
   is the only-begotten Son of the Father, which is of the same import
   with that here opposed by our catechists, hath been before declared and
   proved, chap. vii.

   Q. But how must we answer these testimonies?

   A. Before I answer to each testimony, it is to be known that this
   generation of the essence of the Father is impossible; for if Christ
   were begotten of the essence of his Father, either he took his whole
   essence or but part. Part of his essence he could not take, for the
   divine essence is impartible; nor the whole, for it being one in number
   is incommunicable. [311]

   And this is the fruit of measuring spiritual things by carnal, infinite
   by finite, God by ourselves, the object of faith by corrupted rules of
   corrupted reason. But, -- 1. That which God hath revealed to be so is
   not impossible to be so. [312] Let God be true, and all men liars. That
   this is revealed hath been undeniably evinced. 2. What is impossible in
   finite, limited essences, may be possible and convenient to that which
   is infinite and unlimited, as is that whereof we speak. 3. It is not
   impossible, in the sense wherein that word must here be used, if any
   thing be signified by it. "It is not, it cannot be so in limited
   things, therefore not in things infinite;" -- "We cannot comprehend it,
   therefore it cannot be so;" -- "But the nature of the thing about which
   it is is inconsistent with it," This is denied, for God hath revealed
   the contrary. 4. For the parting of the divine essence, or receiving a
   part of the divine essence, our catechists might have left it out, as
   having none to push at with it, none standing in the way of that horn
   of their dilemma. 5. We say, then, that in the eternal generation of
   the Son, the whole essence of the Father is communicated to the Son as
   to a personal existence in the same essence, without multiplication or
   division of it, the same essence continuing still one in number; and
   this without the least show of impossibility in an infinite essence,
   all the arguments that lie against it being taken from the properties
   and attendancies of that which is finite.

   Come we to the particular testimonies. The first is Mic. v. 2, "But
   thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of
   Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler
   in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting,"
   or "the days of eternity."

   Q. How must this first testimony of the Scripture be answered?

   A. This testimony hath nothing at all of his generation of the essence
   of his Father, and a pre-eternal generation it no way proves; for here
   is mention of beginning and days, which in eternity have no place. And
   those words, which in the Vulgar are "from the days of eternity," in
   the Hebrew are "from the days of seculi," -- the days of an age; and
   "dies seculi" are the same with "dies antiqui," as Isa. lxiii. 9, 11;
   Mal. iii. 4. The sense of this place is, that Christ should have the
   original of his nativity from the beginning, and from the ancient
   years; that is, from that time wherein God established a king among his
   people, which was done really in David, who was a Bethlehemite, and the
   author of the stock and family of Christ. [313]

   Ans. 1. Who necessitated our catechists to urge this place to prove the
   generation of Christ, when it is used only to prove his generation to
   be eternal, the thing itself being proved by other testimonies in
   abundance? That he was begotten of the Father is confessed; that he was
   begotten of the essence of his Father was before proved. Yea, that
   which is here called mvts'tyv?, his "goings forth," is his generation
   of his Father, or somewhat else that our adversaries can assign; that
   it is not the latter shall immediately be evinced.

   2. Here is no mention of the mqdm?, "beginning;" and those who in the
   latter words reject the Vulgar edition cannot honestly insist on the
   former from thence because it serves their turn. Yet how that word is
   sometimes used, and in what sense it may be so, where "eternity" is
   intended, hath been declared in the last chapter.

   3. That "days" are not used with and to express "eternity" in
   Scripture, though strictly there be no days or time in eternity, is
   absurd negligence and confidence to affirm: Job x. 5, "Are thy days as
   the days of man? are thy years as man's days?" Hence God is called "The
   Ancient of days," Dan. vii. 9. "Thou art the same, and thy years shall
   not fail," Heb. i. 12.

   4. For the word gnolam [vlm?], translated "seculi," it hath in the
   Scripture various significations. It comes from a word signifying "to
   hide," [314] and denotes an unknown, hidden duration. Principally
   "perpetuum, æternum, sempiternum," -- that which is pre-eternal and
   eternal. Sometimes a very long time, Gen. ix. 12, and verse 16, that is
   perpetual: so Gen. xvii. 13, and in other places, with a reference to
   the sovereignty of God. Gen. xxi. 33, it is ascribed to God as a
   property of his, and signifies "eternal," Jehova gnolam [yhvh vlm?]: so
   Ps. lxxxix. 2, as also Isa. xlv. 17. Let all places where the word in
   Scripture in this sense is used be reckoned up (which are above three
   hundred), and it will appear that in far the greatest number of them it
   signifies absolutely "eternity." In the places of Isa. lxiii. 9, 11,
   and Mal. iii. 4, only a long time, indeed, is signified, but yet that
   which reaches to the utmost of the thing or matter treated of. And upon
   the same rule, where it is put absolutely it signifies "eternity." So
   doth aion in the New Testament, by which the LXX. often render gnolam
   [vlm?]; whence pro chronon aionion may be "from eternity," 2 Tim. i. 9,
   Tit. i. 2; wherein, also, with a like expression to that under
   consideration, the "times of eternity" are mentioned, though perhaps
   with a peculiar respect to something at the beginning of the world.
   This, then, is here expressed: He that was in the fulness of time born
   at Bethlehem, had his goings forth from the Father from eternity.

   5. The pretended sense of our adversaries is a bold corruption of the
   text; for, -- (1.) It applies that to David and his being born at
   Bethlehem which the Holy Ghost expressly applies to Jesus Christ, Matt.
   ii. 5, 6, and John vii. 42. (2.) The goings forth of Christ in this
   sense are no more from everlasting than every other man's who is from
   Adam, when yet this is peculiarly spoken of him, by way of incomparable
   eminency. (3.) They cannot give any one instance of the like
   expression, -- that "his goings forth are from eternity" should signify
   he had his original from an ancient stock. (4.) If only Christ's
   original of the tribe of Judah and of the house of David were intended,
   why was not that expressed in plain terms, as it is in other places,
   and as the place of his birth, namely, Bethlehem, is in this? So that
   we have already met our catechists and stopped them at this wall, their
   attempt at it being very faint and absurd. And yet this is the sum of
   what is pleaded by Socinus against Weik, cap. vii. p. 424; Smalcius
   against Smiglecius, cap. xxvi.; Ostorod. Instit. cap. vii., with the
   rest of them. He, then, who was born at Bethlehem in the fulness of
   time, of the house of David as concerning the flesh, Rom. i. 3, had
   also his "goings forth," his birth or generation of the Father, "of
   old, from the days of eternity;" which is that which this testimony
   confirms.

   Grotius on this place, according to his wont, outgoes his companions
   one step at least (as he was a bold man at conjectures), and applies
   this prophecy to Zerubbabel: "Natus ex Bethlehemo Zorobabel recte
   dicitur, quod ex Davidis familia esset, quæ orta Bethlehemo;" --
   "Zerubbabel is rightly said to be born at Bethlehem, being of the
   family of David, which had its original from Bethlehem."

   That Zerubbabel is here at all intended he doth not attempt to prove,
   either from the text, context, circumstances of the place, design of
   the prophecy, or any thing else that might give light into the
   intendment of the Holy Ghost. That it belongs properly to Christ we
   have a better interpreter to assure us than Grotius or any of his
   rabbins, Matt. ii. 4-6. I know that in his annotations on that place he
   allows the accommodation of the words to Christ; but we cannot allow
   them to be spoken of any other, the Holy Ghost expressly fitting them
   to him. And if Zerubbahel, who was born at Babylon, may be said to be
   born at Bethlehem because David, from whom he descended, was born
   there, what need all that labour and trouble that our Saviour might be
   born at Bethlehem? If it could not be said of Christ that he was born
   at Bethlehem, though he were of the lineage of David, unless he had
   actually been born there indeed, certainly Zerubbabel, who was born at
   Babylon, could not be said, on the account of his progenitor five
   hundred years before, to be born there.

   For the second part of this text, or the words we insist on for the
   proof of our intention, he useth the same shift in the same words with
   our catechists, "Origo ipsi ab olim, a temporibus longis; id est,
   originem trahit a domo illustri antiquitus, et per quingentos annos
   regnatrice;" -- "His original is from of old, from a long time; that
   is, he hath his original from an ancient illustrious house that had
   reigned five hundred years."

   Of the sense of the words I have spoken before. I shall only add, that
   the use of this note is to confute the other; for if his being born at
   Bethlehem signify his being of the family of David, and nothing else,
   he being not indeed bern there, what need this addition, if these
   obscure words signify no more but what was spoken before? Yea, and
   herein the learned man forsaketh his masters, all generally concluding
   that it is the Messiah who is here alone intended. The Chaldee
   paraphrast expressly puts in the name of Messiah. His words are, "Out
   of thee shall the Messiah come forth before me." And some of them do
   mystically interpret kedem [qdm?] of the mind of God, from whence the
   word or wisdom of God is brought forth; because, as they say, the word
   denotes the first numeration of the crown, or of that name of God which
   signifies his essence.

   The second is Ps. ii. 7, "The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son;
   this day have I begotten thee."

   Q. To this second what is to be answered?

   A. Neither in that is there any thing of generation of the essence of
   the Father, nor of a pre-eternal generation; for the word "to-day,"
   signifying a certain time, cannot denote pre-eternity. But that God
   begot him doth not evince that he was begotten of his essence; which
   appears from hence, 1. That the same words, "This day have I begotten
   thee," are in the first sense used of David, who was begotten neither
   from eternity nor of the essence of the Father. 2. Because the apostle
   Paul brings these words to prove the resurrection of Christ, Acts xiii.
   33. And the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews cites them for the
   glorifying of the Lord Jesus, Heb. i. 5, v. 5. And lastly, from hence,
   that it is manifest that God otherwise begets than by his essence,
   seeing the Scripture declares believers to be begotten of God, as is to
   be seen, John i. 13, 1 John iii. 9; James i. 18. [315]

   1. There is mention in these words of Christ's generation of his
   Father, of being "begotten" of him before his incarnation, this being
   spoken of him under the old testament; and to deny that there is any
   such thing in the text as that which, upon this consideration, we urge
   it to prove, is only to beg the thing in question.

   2. "This day," being spoken of God, of him who is eternal, to whom all
   time is so present as that nothing is properly yesterday nor today,
   does not denote necessarily such a proportion of time as is intimated,
   but is expressive of an act eternally present, nor past nor future.

   3. It cannot be proved that these words are spoken at all of David so
   much as typically, nor any thing else in that psalm from verse? to the
   end: yea, the contrary is evident from every verse following,
   especially the 12th, where kings and rulers are called to worship him
   of whom he speaks, and threatened with destruction if they do not; and
   they are pronounced blessed who put their trust in him; which cannot be
   spoken of David, God declaring them to be cursed who put their trust in
   man, Jer. xvii. 5-8.

   4. It is granted that the apostle makes use of these words when he
   mentions the resurrection and exaltation of Christ; not that Christ was
   then begotten, but that he was then declared to be the only-begotten
   Son of God, his resurrection and exaltation being manifestations of his
   sonship, not causes of his filiation, as hath been at large declared.
   So the sun is said to arise when it doth first to us appear.

   5. True, "God hath other sons, and believers are said to be begotten of
   God;" but how? By regeneration, and turning from sin, as in the places
   quoted is evident That Christ is so begotten of God is blasphemous once
   to imagine. Besides, he is the only-begotten Son of the Father, so that
   no other is begotten with a generation of the same kind with him. It is
   evident, then, by this testimony, and from these words, that Christ is
   so the Son of God as no angels are his sons in the same kind: for that
   the apostle produceth these words to prove, Heb. i. 5, "For unto which
   of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I
   begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to
   me a Son?" Now, the angels are the sons of God by creation, Job i. 6,
   xxxviii. 7. He is also such a Son and so begotten as believers are not;
   for they are begotten by regeneration from sin and adoption into the
   family of God. Therefore Christ, who is the Son of God in another kind
   than angels and men, who are so by creation, regeneration, and
   adoption, is the natural Son of God by eternal generation; which is
   also proved from this place.

   In this whole psalm Grotius takes no notice of Jesus Christ: indeed, in
   the entrance he tells us that a mystical and abstruse sense of it may
   belong to Christ, and so the rabbins acknowledge, and so the apostle
   took it; [316] but throughout the whole doth he not make the least
   application of it to Christ, but merely to David, although so many
   passages of it are urged in the New Testament to have had their
   accomplishment in Christ and the things which concerned him. These
   words, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee," he says may be
   thus rendered, "O fili mi, hodie (id est, hoc tempore) ego to genui:
   novam vitam, scilicet regalem tibi contuli." But, 1. That the words may
   not aptly be so translated, that they are not so rendered by the
   apostle, Heb. i. 5, he knew well enough, bny 'th? is filius meus tu,
   not fili mi. Nor doth the rendering of it by the vocative any way
   answer the words going before, "?I will declare the decree: the Lord
   hath said unto me, Thou art my Son:' that is the thing I will declare."
   2. That "hodie" should be "hoc tempore," relating to any certain time
   of David's reign, cannot be reconciled to the apostle's application of
   that expression on sundry occasions, as hath been manifested. 3. "I
   have given thee a new or a regal life,'"is somewhat an uncouth
   exposition of "genui re," without warrant, without reason or argument;
   and it is inconsistent with the time of the psalm's writing, according
   to Grotius himself. He refers it to 2 Sam. viii., when David had been
   king over Israel many years.

   To serve his hypothesis, the last two verses are miserably wrested. The
   command of worshipping Christ, verse 12, is a command of doing homage
   to David! And the last verse is thus glossed, "Beati omnes qui
   confidunt in eo, i.e., qui fidei ejus regis (id est, meæ) se
   permittunt." "They are blessed," says David, "who commit themselves to
   my faith and care." Doubtless the thought of any such thing was as
   remote from the heart of the holy man as this gloss is from the sense
   of the place. That they are blessed who trust in the Lord, that is,
   "commit themselves to his care," he everywhere declareth, yea, this he
   makes always the property of a blessed man; but that they are so who
   trust in him, not the least word to that purpose did the holy person
   ever utter. He knew they are cursed of God who put their trust in man.
   The word here is chvsy?, from chsh?, "to repair to any one for
   protection;' and it is used to express our trusting in God, Ps. xviii.
   30, as also Ps. xxxi. 19, on which men are frequently pronounced
   blessed; but that it should be applied to David, and a blessing annexed
   thereunto, we were to learn.

   The third testimony, of Ps. cx. 3, we pass over with our adversaries,
   as not to the purpose in hand, being a mistake of the Vulgar Latin.

   The fourth is Prov. viii. 23, "I was set up from everlasting, from the
   beginning, or ever the earth was."

   Q. What dost thou answer to this testimony?

   A. That thou mayst understand the matter the better, know that from
   this place they thus dispute: "The Wisdom of God is begotten from
   eternity; Christ is the Wisdom of God: therefore he is begotten from
   eternity, 1 Cor. i. 24." That this argument is not firm appears from
   hence, that, -- 1. Solomon treats of wisdom simply and absolutely
   considered, without the addition of the word "God;" Paul not simply and
   absolutely, but with the addition of the word "God." 2. Solomon treats
   of wisdom, which neither is a person nor can be, as appears from the
   diverse effects ascribed to this wisdom, chap. vii., viii., ix.;
   amongst which are these words, "By me kings rule, and princes decree
   righteousness;" and in the beginning of the 9th chapter, he brings in
   wisdom sending her maidens, and inviting all to her: but Paul treateth
   of that Wisdom which is a person. 3. The words which are rendered "from
   everlasting," in the Hebrew are "a seculo;" but that "from everlasting"
   and "a seculo" are diverse, Isa. lxiv. 4, Jer. ii. 20, Luke i. 70, with
   many like places, do declare. [317]

   1. Our argument hence is: "Christ, the second person of the Trinity, is
   spoken of, Prov. viii. 23, under the name of Wisdom; now, it is said
   expressly there of Wisdom that it was begotten from everlasting:' and
   therefore the eternal generation of Christ is hence confirmed." Our
   reasons are:-- (1.) Because the things here spoken of can be applied to
   no other. (2.) Because the very same things are affirmed of Christ,
   John i. 1. (3.) Because Christ is the Wisdom of God, and so called in
   the Scripture, not only in the expression of ho Logos, but rhetos, 1
   Cor. i. 30. (4.) That by Wisdom Solomon intended the Wisdom of God, and
   that that word may be supplied, is most evident from what is spoken of
   it. Let the place be read. (5.) Christ is called not only the "Wisdom
   of God," but also Wisdom absolutely and simply; and that not only Prov.
   i. 20, but Matt. xi. 19. (6.) The Wisdom that Solomon treats of is
   evidently a person, and such things are ascribed thereunto as can be
   proper to none but a person. Such are these, chap. viii. 30, 31, "I was
   by him, one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing
   always before him; rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth," etc.
   That it is the same wisdom spoken of chap. vii. and here is not
   evident; yet is there not any thing in that attributed to it but what
   suits well unto a person, -- much less in the beginning of the 9th
   chapter, the invitation there being such as may be made by a person
   only. It is a person who sends out messengers to invite to a banquet,
   as Christ doth in the gospel. "Kings rule and princes decree justice"
   by the authority of a person, and without him they can do nothing.

   2. The word translated "from everlasting" is the same with that
   considered before, Mic. v. 2. The words following do so evidently
   confirm the meaning of the word to be as expressed that it is
   marvellous the gentlemen durst venture upon the exception in this
   place: "The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his
   works of old;" that is, before the creation, as is at large expounded,
   verses 23-29.

   And this is all, the whole sum of what any of our adversaries, or
   rather the adversaries of Jesus Christ, have to object in their cause
   against these testimonies; whence we thus argue:--

   He who was begotten of God the Father with an eternal generation is
   eternal, and so, consequently, God; but so is Jesus Christ begotten of
   God the Father with an eternal generation: therefore he is eternal, and
   God blessed for ever.

   To clear what hath been spoken, I shall close my considerations of this
   text of Scripture with a brief parallel between what is spoken in this
   place of Wisdom and what is asserted of Jesus Christ in the New
   Testament:--

   1. It is Wisdom that is spoken of: so is Christ, Matt. xi. 19; 1 Cor.
   i. 24; Col. ii. 3. 2. "Wisdom was set up from everlasting," chap. viii.
   23: "Grace is given in Christ, pro chronon aionion, from everlasting,"
   2 Tim. i. 9; "He is the beginning," Col. i. 18; "The first and the
   last," Rev. i. 17. 3. "The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his
   way," says Wisdom, verse 22: "In the beginning was the Word, and the
   Word was with God," John i. 1. 4. "Before the mountains were settled,
   before the hills was I brought forth," verse 25: "He is the first-born
   of every creature," Col. i. 15; "He is before all," verse 17. 5. "I was
   daily his delight, rejoicing always before him," verse 30: "This is my
   beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," Matt. iii. 17; "The
   only-begotten Son is in the bosom of the Father," John i. 18. 6. "By me
   kings reign, and princes," etc., verses 15, 16: He is "the Prince of
   the kings of the earth," Rev. i. 5; the "King of kings, and Lord of
   lords," Rev. xix. 16. 7. "Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth,
   and my delights were with the sons of men," verse 31: "The Word was
   made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as
   of the only-begotten of the Father," John i. 14. 8. Compare also verse
   34 with John xiii. 17, Luke xi. 28, John x. 9; and verses 35, 36 with
   John vi. 44, 47. And many the like instances might be given.

   Grotius takes no notice of Christ in this place, yea, he seems
   evidently to exclude him from being here intended. His first note on
   verse 1 is, "Hæc de ea sapientia quæ in Lege apparet exponunt Hebræi:
   et sane el, si non soli, at præcipue, hæc attributa conveniunt;" --
   "The Hebrews expound these things of that wisdom which appears in the
   law; and truly these attributes agree thereunto, if not only, yet
   chiefly." Of this assertion he gives no reason. The contrary is evident
   from what is above said and proved. The authority of the modern
   rabbins, in the exposition of those places of Scripture which concern
   the Messiah, is of no value. They do not only, as their forefathers,
   err, not knowing the Scriptures, but maliciously corrupt them, out of
   hatred to Jesus Christ. In the meantime, one no less versed in the
   Hebrew authors than our annotator, expounding this place, from them
   concludes, "Nec dubito, hinc Johannem augustum illud et magnificum
   Evangelii sui initium sumpsisse, In principio erat Verbum;' nam Verbum
   et Sapientia idem sunt, et secundam Trinitatis personam indicant;" --
   "I doubt not but that John took that reverend and lofty entrance of his
   Gospel, In the beginning was the Word' from hence; for the Word and
   Wisdom are the same, and denote the second person of the Trinity."
   [318]

   Before I proceed to those that follow, I shall add some of them which
   are produced and insisted on usually for the same end and purpose with
   those mentioned before, and which in other places are excepted against
   by the catechists with whom we have to do, but properly belong to this
   head.

   Of those is John xvii. 5, "And now, O Father, glorify me with thine own
   self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was." To
   this they put in their exceptions towards the end of the chapter under
   consideration, saying, --

   Q. What answerest thou to this?

   A. Neither is here a divine nature proved; for that one may have glory
   with the Father before the world was made and yet not be God appeareth
   from that of 2 Tim. i. 9, where the apostle says of believers that
   grace was given unto them before the world began. Besides, it is here
   written that Jesus asked this glory, which is repugnant to the divine
   nature. But the sense of the place is, that Christ asked God that he
   would really give him that glory which he had with God in his decree
   before the world was. [319]

   1. A divine glory proves a divine nature. This Christ had from
   eternity, for he had it before the world began; therefore he had a
   divine nature also. It is the manifestation of his glory, which he had
   eclipsed and laid aside for a season, that here he desires of God,
   Phil. ii. 6-11. He glorified his Father by manifesting the glory of his
   deity, his name, to others; and he prays the Father to glorify him as
   he had glorified him on the earth. 2. There is not the same reason of
   what is here asserted of Christ and what is said of the elect, 2 Tim.
   i. 9. Christ here positively says he had heichon (glorps) oite eis
   Phateer bephore tee oorld oas; nor is this anywhere, in any one tittle
   in the Scripture expounded to be any otherwise but in a real having of
   that glory. The grace that is given to believers is not said to be
   before the world was, but pro chronon aionion, which may denote the
   first promise, Gen. iii. 15, as it doth Tit. i. 2; and if it be
   intended of the purpose of God, which was from eternity (as the words
   will bear), it is so expounded in twenty places, 3. Though the divine
   nature prayed not, yet he who was in the form of God, and humbled
   himself to take upon him the form and employment of a servant, might
   and did pray. The Godhead prayed not, but he who was God prayed. 4. For
   the sense assigned, let them once show us, in the whole book of God,
   where this expression, "I had eichon," may be possibly interpreted, "I
   had it in purpose," or "I was predestinated to it," and not "I had it
   really and indeed," and they say something to the purpose. In the
   meantime, they do but corrupt the word of God (as many do) by this
   pretended interpretation of it. 5. If predestination only be intended,
   here is nothing singular spoken of Christ, but what is common to him
   with all believers, when evidently Christ speaks of something that
   belonged to him eminently. 6. The very express tenor of the words will
   not admit of this gloss (let what violence can be used): Kai nun
   doxason me su Pater para seauto te doxe he eichon pro tou ton kosmon
   einai para soi "The glory that I had with thee, let me have it
   manifested with thee, now my work is done."

   Grotius falls in with our catechists: Te doxe he eichon, Destinatione
   tua; ut 1 Pet. i. 20, Rev. xiii. 8, sic et Eph. i. 3, 4, et infra, ver.
   24. Simile loquendi genus. Sic Legem fuisse ante mundum aiunt Hebræi."
   Again, Para soi, refer ad illud eichon, et intellige, ut diximus, in
   decreto tuo.

   But what intends the learned man by those places of 1 Pet. i. 20, Rev.
   xiii. 8? Is it to expound the thing that he supposes to be expressed?
   or to intimate that the phrase here used is expounded by the use of it
   in those other places? If the first, he begs that to be the sense of
   this place which is the sense of them, though neither the scope of the
   places nor the sense of the words themselves will bear it. If the
   latter, it is most false. There is not one word, phrase, or expression,
   in any one of the places pointed unto, at all coincident with them here
   used. Besides, the two places mentioned are of very different senses,
   the one speaking of God's purpose appointing Christ to be a mediator,
   the other of the promise given presently after the fall. 2. We grant
   that Christ, in respect of his human nature, was predestinated unto
   glory; but that he calls God's purpose his "glory," "the glory which he
   had," "which he had with God," wherewith he desires to be "glorified
   with him again," is to be proved from the text, or context, or phrase
   of speech, or parallel place, or analogy of faith, or somewhat, and not
   nakedly to be imposed on us. Let Prov. viii. 22-31, Phil. ii. 6-11, be
   consulted, as parallel to this place. Eph. i. 3, 4, speaks indeed of
   our predestination in Christ, "that we should be holy," and so come to
   glory, but of the glory that Christ had before the world was it speaks
   not; yea, verse 3, we are said to be actually "blessed," or to have the
   heavenly blessings, when we do enjoy them, which we are elected to,
   verse 4. What the Jews say of the Law, and the like, we must allow
   learned men to tell us, that they may be known to be so, although the
   sense of the Scripture be insensibly darkened thereby.

   To the same purpose is that of Peter, 1 Epist. i. 10, 11, "Of which
   salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who
   prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: searching what, or
   what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify,
   when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory
   that should follow." To which add that more clear place, 1 Pet. iii.
   18-20, "Quickened by the Spirit, by which also he went and preached
   unto the spirits in prison, which sometime were disobedient ... in the
   days of Noah." He who was in the days of the prophets of old, and in
   the days of Noah, so long before his being born according to the flesh,
   he was from everlasting, or had an existence antecedent to his
   incarnation; but this is expressly affirmed of our Saviour. It was his
   Spirit that spake in the prophets; which if he were not, could not be,
   for of him who is not nothing can be affirmed. He preached by his
   Spirit in the days of Noah to the spirits that are in prison.

   Of this latter place our catechists take no notice; about the first
   they inquire, --

   Q. What answerest thou to this?

   A. Neither is a divine nature proved from hence: for the Spirit which
   was in the prophets may be said to be "the Spirit of Christ," not that
   he was given of Christ, but because he fore-declared the things of
   Christ, as Peter there speaks; "he testified beforehand of the
   sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow." Which manner
   of speaking we have, 1 John iv. 6, "Hence know we the spirit; of truth,
   and the spirit of error;" where it is not called the spirit of truth
   and error because truth and error as persons do bestow the spirit, but
   because the spirit of truth speaks the things of truth, and the spirit
   of error the things of error. [320]

   1. It is confessed that if the Spirit that was in the prophets was the
   Spirit of Christ, then he hath a divine nature; for the only evasion
   used is, that it is not, or may not (possibly) be, so meant in this
   place, not denying but that if it be so, then the conclusion intended
   follows. 2. That this place is to be interpreted by 1 John iv. 6 there
   is no colour nor pretence. Christ is a person; he was so when Peter
   wrote: truth and error are not, and the spirit of them is to be
   interpreted according to the subject-matter. 3. The Spirit in other
   places is called the Spirit of Christ in the same sense as he is called
   the Spirit of God, Rom. viii. 9, Gal. iv. 6. 4. The Spirit of Christ is
   said directly to take of his and show it to his apostles, John xvi. 15;
   and so he did to the prophets. They may as well, on the pretence of 1
   John iv. 6, deny him to be the Spirit of God the Father as the Spirit
   of Christ, as being of him and sent by him.

   And thus far of the testimonies proving the pre-existence of Christ
   unto his incarnation, and so, consequently, his eternity: whence it
   follows that he is God over all, blessed for ever, having this evidence
   of his eternal power and Godhead. Sundry others of the same tendency
   will fall under consideration in our progress.

Chapter X.

   Of the names of God given unto Christ.

   In the next place, as a third head, our catechists consider the
   scriptural attributions of the names of God unto our Saviour, Jesus
   Christ; whence this is our argument:--

   "He who is Jehovah, God, the only true God, he is God properly by
   nature; but Jesus Christ is Jehovah, the true God, etc.: therefore he
   is God properly by nature."

   The proposition is clear in itself. Of the innumerable testimonies
   which are or may be produced to confirm the assumption, our catechists
   fix upon a very few, -- namely, those which are answered by Socinus
   against Weik the Jesuit, whence most of their exceptions to these
   witnesses are transcribed. To the consideration of these they thus
   proceed:--

   Ques. What are those places of Scripture which seem to attribute
   something to Christ in a certain and definite time?

   Ans. They are of two sorts, whereof some respect the names, others the
   works, which they suppose in the Scriptures to be attributed to Christ.

   Q. Which are they that respect the names of Christ?

   A. Those where they suppose in the Scripture that Christ is called
   "Jehovah," etc., Jer. xxiii. 6; Zech. ii. 8; 1 John v. 20; Jude 4; Tit.
   ii. 13; Rev. i. 8, iv. 8; Acts xx. 28; 1 John iii. 16. [321]

   The first testimony is Jer. xxiii. 6, in these words, "In his days
   Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his
   name whereby he shall be Jehovah our righteousness." To which add the
   next, Zech. ii. 8.

   Before I come to consider their exceptions to these texts in
   particular, some things in general may be premised, for the better
   understanding of what we are about, and what from these places we
   intend to prove and confirm:--

   1. The end of citing these two places is, to prove that Jesus Christ is
   in the Old Testament called Jehovah; which is by them denied, the
   granting of it being destructive to their whole cause.

   2. It is granted that Jehovah is the proper and peculiar name of the
   one only true God of Israel; -- a name as far significant of his nature
   and being as possibly we are enabled to understand; yea, so far
   expressive of God, that as the thing signified by it is
   incomprehensible, so many have thought the very word itself to be
   ineffable, or at least not lawful to be uttered. This name God
   peculiarly appropriates to himself in an eminent manner, Exod. vi. 2,
   3; so that this is taken for granted on all hands, that he whose name
   is Jehovah is the only true God, the God of Israel. Whenever that name
   is used properly, without a trope or figure, it is used of him only.
   What the adversaries of Christ except against this shall be vindicated
   in its proper place.

   3. Our catechists have very faintly brought forth the testimonies that
   are usually insisted on in this cause, naming but two of them;
   wherefore I shall take liberty to add a few more to them out of the
   many that are ready at hand: Isa. xl. 3, "The voice of him that crieth
   in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make straight in the
   desert a highway for our God." That it is Christ who is here called
   Jehovah is clear from that farther expression in Mal. iii. 1, and from
   the execution of the thing itself, Matt. iii. 3, Mark i. 2, 3, John i.
   23. Isa. xlv. 22-25, "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of
   the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by
   myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall
   not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall
   swear. Surely, shall one say, in Jehovah have I righteousness and
   strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against
   him shall be ashamed. In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be
   justified, and shall glory." The apostle expressly affirms all this to
   be spoken of Christ, Rom. xiv. 10-12, etc. Hos. xiii. 14 is also
   applied to Christ, 1 Cor. xv. 54, 55. He that would at once consider
   all the texts of the Old Testament, chiefly ascribing this name to
   Christ, let him read Zanchius "De Tribus Elohim," who hath made a large
   collection of them.

   Let us now see what our catechists except against the first
   testimony:--

   Q. What dost thou answer to the first testimony?

   A. First, that hence it cannot be necessarily evinced that the name of
   Jehovah is attributed to Christ. For these words, "And this is his name
   whereby they shall call him, The Lord our righteousness," may be
   referred to Israel, of whom he spake a little before, "In his days
   shall Judah be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely," etc., as from a
   like place may be seen in the same prophet, chap. xxxiii. 15, 16, where
   he saith, "In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
   righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and
   righteousness in the land. In those days shall Judah be saved, and
   Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall
   be called, The Lord our righteousness." For in the Hebrew it is
   expressly read, "They shall call her;" which last words are referred of
   necessity to Jerusalem, and in this place answereth to Israel, which is
   put in the first place. It seems, therefore, likely that also, in the
   first place, these words, "They shall call him," are referred to
   Israel. But although we should grant that the name of Jehovah may be
   referred unto Christ, yet from the other testimonies it appears that it
   cannot be asserted that Christ is called Jehovah simply, neither doth
   it thence follow that Christ is really Jehovah. Whether, therefore,
   these last words in this testimony of Jeremiah be understood of Christ
   or of Israel, their sense is, "Thou Jehovah, our one God, wilt justify
   us;" for at that time when Christ was to appear God would do that in
   Israel. [322]

   The sum of this answer is:-- 1. It may be these words are not spoken of
   Christ, but of Israel; 2. The same words are used of that which is not
   God; 3. If they be referred to Christ, they prove him not to be God; 4.
   Their sense is, that God will justify us in the days of Christ. Of each
   briefly:--

   1. The subject spoken of all along is Christ:-- (1.) He is the
   subject-matter of whatever here is affirmed: "I will raise up a
   righteous Branch to David; he shall be a king, and he shall reign, and
   his name shall be called The Lord our righteousness." (2.) Why are
   these words to be referred to Israel only, and not also to Judah (if to
   any but Christ), they being both named together, and upon the same
   account (yea, and Judah hath the pre-eminence, being named in the first
   place)? And if they belong to both, the words should be, "This is their
   name whereby they shall be called." (3.) Israel was never called "our
   righteousness," but Christ is called so upon the matter in the New
   Testament sundry times, and is so, 1 Cor. i. 30; so that, without
   departing from the propriety of the words, intendment, and scope of the
   place, with the truth of the thing itself, these words cannot be so
   perverted. The violence used to them is notoriously manifest.

   2. The expression is not the same in both places, neither is Jerusalem
   there called "The Lord our righteousness," but He who calls her is "The
   Lord our righteousness;" and so are the words rendered by Arias
   Montanus and others. And if what Jerusalem shall be called be
   intimated, and not what His name is that calls her, it is merely by a
   metonymy, upon the account of the presence of Christ in her; as the
   church is called "Christ" improperly, 1 Cor. xii. 12: Christ properly
   is Jesus only. But the words are not to be rendered, "This is the name
   whereby she shall be called," but, "This is the name whereby he shall
   call her, The Lord our righteousness;" that is, he who is the Lord our
   righteousness shall call her to peace and safety, which are there
   treated on. Christ is our righteousness; Jerusalem is not.

   3. It is evident that Christ is absolutely called Jehovah in this as
   well as in the other places before mentioned, and many more; and it
   hence evidently follows that he is Jehovah, as he who properly is
   called so, and understood by that name. Where God simply says his name
   is Jehovah, we believe him; and where he says the name of the Branch of
   the house of David is Jehovah, we believe him also. And we say hence
   that Christ is Jehovah, or the words have not a tolerable sense. Of
   this again afterward.

   4. The interpretation given of the words is most perverse and opposite
   to the meaning of them. The prophet says not that "Jehovah the one God
   shall be our righteousness," but, "The Branch of David shall be the
   Lord our righteousness." The subject is the Branch of David, not
   Jehovah. "The Branch of David shall be called The Lord our
   righteousness;" that is, say they, "The Lord shall justify us when the
   Branch of David shall be brought forth." Who could have discovered this
   sense but our catechists and their masters, whose words these are! It
   remaineth, then, that the Branch of David, who ruleth in righteousness,
   is Jehovah our righteousness; -- our righteousness, as being made so to
   us; Jehovah, as being so in himself.

   Grotius expounds this place, as that of Mic. v. 2, of Zerubbabel,
   helping on his friends with a new diversion which they knew not of;
   Socinus, as he professes, being not acquainted with the Jewish doctors,
   -- though some believe him not. [323] And yet the learned annotator
   cannot hold out as he begins, but is forced to put out the name
   Zerubbabel, and to put in that of the people, when he comes to the name
   insisted on; so leaving no certain design in the whole words from the
   beginning to the ending.

   Two things doth he here oppose himself in to the received
   interpretation of Christians:-- 1. That it is Zerubbabel who is here
   intended. 2. That it is the people who are called "The Lord our
   righteousness."

   For the first, thus he on verse 15, "Germen justum, -- a righteous
   Branch:" -- "Zorobabelem, qui tsmch?, ut hic appellatur, ita et
   Zechariæ vi. 12, nimirum quod velut surculus renatus esset ex arbore
   Davidis, quasi præcisa Justitiæ nomine commendatur Zorobabel etiam apud
   Zechariam ix. 9;" -- "Zerubbabel, who is here called the Branch, as
   also Zech. vi. 12, because as a branch he arose from the tree of David,
   which was as cut off. Also, Zerubbabel is commended for justice (or
   righteousness), Zech. ix. 9."

   That this is a prophecy of Christ the circumstances of the place
   evince. The rabbins were also of the same mind, as plentiful
   collections from them are made to demonstrate it, by Joseph de Voysin,
   Pug. Fid. par. 3, dist. 1, cap. iv. And the matter spoken of can be
   accommodated to no other, as hath been declared. Grotius' proofs that
   Zerubbabel is intended are worse than the opinion itself. That he is
   called the Branch, Zech. vi. 12, is most false. He who is called the
   Branch there is a king and a priest, "He shall rule upon his throne,
   and he shall be a priest;" which Zerubbabel was not, nor had any thing
   to do with the priestly office, which in his days was administered by
   Joshua. More evidently false is it that he is spoken of Zech. ix. 9;
   which place is precisely interpreted of Christ, and the accomplishment,
   in the very letter of the thing foretold, recorded, Matt. xxi. 5. The
   words are: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
   Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having
   salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of
   an ass." That a man professing Christian religion should affirm any one
   but Jesus Christ to be here intended is somewhat strange.

   Upon the accommodation of the next words to Zerubbabel, "A King shall
   reign and prosper," etc., I shall not insist. They contain not the
   matter of our present contest, though they are pitifully wrested by the
   annotator, and do no ways serve his design.

   For the particular words about which our contest is, this is his
   comment: "?And this is the name whereby they shall call him, nempe
   populum;" -- namely, the people. "They shall call the people." How this
   change comes, "In his days Judah shall be saved, and this is the name
   whereby he shall be called," -- that is, the people shall be called, --
   he shows not. That there is no colour of reason for it hath been
   showed; what hath been said need not to be repeated. He proceeds,
   "Dominus justitia nostra," that is, "Deus nobis bene fecit," -- "God
   hath done well for us, or dealt kindly with us." But it is not about
   the intimation of goodness that is in the words, but of the
   signification of the name given to Jesus Christ, that here we plead. In
   what sense Christ is "The Lord our righteousness" appears, Isa. xlv.
   22-25, 1 Cor. i. 30.

   The second testimony is Zech. ii. 8, in these words, "For thus saith
   the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations
   which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his
   eye. For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them," etc., verses 9-12.

   Briefly to declare what this witness speaks to, before we permit him to
   the examination of our adversaries: The person speaking is the Lord of
   hosts: "Thus saith the Lord of hosts." And he is the person spoken of.
   "After the glory," saith he (or, "After this glorious deliverance of
   you, my people, from the captivity wherein ye were among the nations"),
   "hath he sent me;" -- "Even me, the Lord of hosts, hath he sent." "Thus
   saith the Lord of hosts, He hath, sent me." And it was to the nations,
   as in the words following. And who sent him? "Ye shall know that the
   Lord of hosts hath sent me;" -- "The people of Israel shall know that
   the Lord of hosts hath sent me, the Lord of hosts, to the nations." But
   how shall they know that he is so sent? He tells them, verse 11, it
   shall be known by the conversion of the nations: "Many nations shall be
   joined to the Lord in that day." And what then? "They shall be my
   people;" -- "mine who am sent; my people; the people of the Lord of
   hosts that was sent;" that is, of Jesus Christ. "And I," saith he whose
   people they are, "will dwell in the midst of them" (as God promised to
   do), "and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me." I omit
   the circumstances of the place. Let us now see what is excepted by our
   catechists:--

   Q. What dost thou answer to this second testimony?

   A. The place of Zechariah they thus cite: "This saith the Lord of
   hosts; After the glory hath he sent me to the nations which spoiled
   you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye;" which
   they wrest unto Christ, because here, as they suppose, it is said that
   the Lord of hosts is sent from the Lord of hosts. But these things are
   not so; for it is evident that these words, "After the glory hath he
   sent me," are spoken of another, namely, of the angel who spake with
   Zechariah and the other angel. The same is evident in the same chapter
   a little before, beginning at the fourth verse, where the angel is
   brought in speaking; which also is to be seen from hence, that those
   words which they cite, "This saith the Lord of hosts," in the Hebrew
   may be read, "Thus saith the Lord of hosts;" and those, "Toucheth the
   apple of mine eye," may be read, "The apple of his eye;" which of
   necessity are referred to his messenger, and not to the Lord of hosts."
   [324]

   These gentlemen being excellent at cavils and exceptions, and thereunto
   undertaking to answer any thing in the world, do not lightly acquit
   themselves more weakly and jejunely in any place than in this; for, --

   1. We contend not with them about the translation of the words, their
   exceptions being to the Vulgar Latin only; we take them as they have
   rendered them. To omit that, therefore, --

   2. That these words are spoken by him who is called the angel we grant;
   but the only question is, Who is this angel that speaks them? It is
   evident, from the former chapter and this, that it is the man who was
   upon the red horse, chap. i. 8, who is called "Angelus Jehovæ," verse
   11, and makes intercession for the church, verse 12; which is the
   proper office of Jesus Christ. And that he is no created angel, but
   Jehovah himself, the second person of the Trinity, we prove, because he
   calls himself "The Lord of hosts;" says he will destroy his enemies
   with the shaking of his hand; that he will convert a people, and make
   them his people; and that he will dwell in his church. And yet unto all
   this he adds three times that he is sent of the Lord of hosts. We
   confess, then, all these things to be spoken of him who was sent; but
   upon all these testimonies conclude that he who was sent was the Lord
   of hosts.

   Grotius interprets all this place of an angel, and names him to boot!
   Michael it is; but who that Michael is, and whether he be no more than
   an angel (that is, a messenger), he inquires not. That the ancient
   Jewish doctors interpreted this place of the Messiah is evident. [325]
   Of that no notice here is taken; it is not to the purpose in hand. To
   the reasons already offered to prove that it is no mere creature that
   is here intended, but the Lord of hosts who is sent by the Lord of
   hosts, I shall only add my desire that the friends and apologizers for
   this learned annotator would reconcile this exposition of this place to
   itself, in those things which at first view present themselves to every
   ordinary observer. Take one instance: "Ye shall know that the Lord of
   hosts hath sent me," -- that is, Michael; "and I will dwell in the
   midst of thee." "Templum meum ibi habebo," -- "I will have my temple
   there." If he who speaks be Michael, a created angel, how comes the
   temple of Jehovah to be his? And such let the attempts of all appear to
   be who manage any design against the eternal glory of the Son of God.

   The third testimony is 1 John v. 20, "And we know that the Son of God
   is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that
   is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.
   This is the true God, and eternal life."

   Q. What dost thou answer to this?

   A. These words, "This is the true God," I deny to be referred to the
   Son of God. Not that I deny Christ to be true God, but that place will
   not admit those words to be understood of Christ; for here he treats
   not only of the true God, but of the only true God, as the article
   added in the Greek doth declare. But Christ, although he be true God,
   he is not yet of himself that one God, who by himself, and upon the
   most excellent account, is God, seeing that is only God the Father. Nor
   doth it avail the adversaries, who would have those words referred to
   Christ, because the mention of Christ doth immediately go before those
   words, "This is the true God:" for pronoun relatives, as "this" and the
   like, are not always referred to the next antecedent, but often to that
   which is chiefly spoken of, as Acts vii. 19, 20, x. 6, John ii. 7; from
   which places it appears that the pronoun relative "this" is referred
   not to the next, but to the most remote person. [326]

   1. It is well it is acknowledged that the only true God is here
   intended, and that this is proved by the prefixed article. This may be
   of use afterward.

   2. In what sense these men grant Christ to be a true God we know; -- a
   made God, a God by office, not nature; a man deified with authority: so
   making two true Gods, contrary to innumerable express texts of
   Scripture and the nature of the Deity.

   3. That these words are not meant of Christ they prove, because "he is
   not the only true God, but only the Father." But, friends, these words
   are produced to prove the contrary, as expressly affirming it; and is
   it a sufficient reason to deny it by saying, "He is not the only true
   God, therefore these words are not spoken of him," when the argument
   is, "These words are spoken of him, therefore he is the only true God?"

   4. Their instances prove that in some cases a relative may relate to
   the more remote antecedent, but that in this place that mentioned ought
   to do so they pretend not once to urge; yea, the reason they give is
   against themselves, namely, that "it refers to him chiefly spoken of,"
   which here is eminently and indisputably Jesus Christ. In the places by
   them produced it is impossible, from the subject-matter in hand, that
   the relative should be referred to any but the remoter antecedent; but
   that therefore here we must offer violence to the words, and strain
   them into an incoherence, and transgress all rules of construction
   (nothing enforcing to such a procedure), is not proved.

   5. In the beginning of the 20th verse it is said, "The Son of God is
   come, and hath given us an understanding;" and we are said to be "in
   him," even "in Jesus Christ;" on which it immediately follows, Houtos,
   "This," this Jesus Christ, "is the true God, and eternal life."

   6. That Jesus Christ is by John peculiarly called "life," and "eternal
   life," is evident both from his Gospel and this Epistle; and without
   doubt, by the same term, in his usual manner, he expresses here the
   same person. Chap. i. 2, v. 12, 20, "The Son of God is life, eternal
   life: he that hath the Son hath life: we are in him, in his Son Jesus
   Christ: this is the true God, and eternal life." So he began, and so he
   ends his Epistle.

   And this is all our adversaries have to say against this most express
   testimony of the divine nature of Jesus Christ; in their entrance
   whereunto they cry, "Hail, master!" as one before them did ("He is a
   true God"), but in the close betray him, as far as lies in them, by
   denying his divine nature.

   Even at the light of this most evident testimony, the eyes of Grotius
   dazzled that he could not see the truth. His note is, Houtos estin ho
   alethinos Theos, Is nempe quem Iesus monstravit colendumque docuit, non
   alius, Houtos sæpe refertur ad aliquid præcedens non amesos, Acts viii.
   19, x. 6." The very same plea with the former; only Acts viii. 19 is
   mistaken for Acts vii. 19, the place urged by our catechists, and
   before them by Socinus against Weik, to whom not only they, but Grotius
   is beholden. That citation of Acts x. 6 helps not the business at all.
   Houtos is twice used, once immediately at the beginning of the verse,
   secondly being guided by the first; the latter is referred to the same
   person, nor can possibly signify any other. Here is no such thing, not
   any one circumstance to cause us to put any force upon the constructure
   of the words, the discourse being still of the same person, without any
   alteration; which in the other places is not.

   Of the next testimony, which is from these words of Jude, "Denying the
   only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ," verse 4 (not to increase
   words), this is the sum: There being but one article prefixed to all
   the words, it seems to carry the sense that it is wholly spoken of
   Christ. The catechists reckon some places where one article serves to
   sundry things, as Matt. xxi. 12; but it is evident that they are
   utterly things of another kind and another manner of speaking than what
   is here: but the judgment hereof is left to the reader, it being not
   indeed clear to me whether Christ be called Despotes anywhere in the
   New Testament, though he be [called] Lord, and God, and the true God,
   full often.

   The second [chapter] of Titus, verse 13, must be more fully insisted
   on: "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearance of the
   great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."

   Q. What dost thou answer to this?

   A. In this place they strive to evince by two reasons that the epithet
   of the "great God" is referred to Christ. The first is the rule
   forementioned, of one article prefixed to all the words; the other,
   that we do not expect that coming of the Father, but of the Son. To the
   first you have an answer already in the answer to the fourth testimony;
   to the other I answer, Paul doth not say, "Expecting the coming of the
   great God," but, "Expecting the appearance of the glory of the great
   God." But now the words of Christ show that the glory of God the Father
   may be said to be illustrated when Christ comes to judgment, when he
   saith that he shall come in glory, that is, with the glory of God his
   Father, Matt. xvi. 27; Mark viii. 38. Besides, what inconvenience is it
   if it shall be said that God the Father shall come (as they cite the
   words out of the Vulgar), when the Son comes to judge the world? Shall
   not Christ sustain the person of the Father, as of him from whom he
   hath received this office of judging? [327]

   About the reading of the words we shall not contend with them. It is
   the original we are to be tried by, and there is in that no ambiguity.
   That Epiphaneia tes doxes, "The appearance of the glory," is a Hebraism
   for "The glorious appearance" cannot be questioned. A hundred
   expressions of that nature in the New Testament may be produced to give
   countenance to this. That the blessed hope looked for is the thing
   hoped for, the resurrection to life and immortality, is not denied.
   Neither is it disputed whether the subject spoken of be Jesus Christ
   and his coming to judgment. The subject is one; his epithets here
   two:-- 1. That belonging to his essence in himself, he is "the great
   God;" 2. That of office unto us, he is "our Saviour." That it is Christ
   which is spoken of appears, -- 1. From the single article that is
   assigned to all the words, Tou megalou Theou kai Soteros hemon Iesou
   Christou which no less signifies one person than that other expression,
   Ho Theos kai Pater Iesou Chrustou, -- "The God and Father of Jesus
   Christ." Should I say that one person is here intended, and not two
   (God and the Father of Jesus Christ being the same), our catechists may
   say, "No; for it is found in another place that there is but one
   article prefixed where sundry persons are after spoken of." But is it
   not evident in those places, from the subject-matter, that they are
   sundry persons, as also from the several conditions of them mentioned,
   as in that of Matt. xxi. 12, "He cast out the sellers and buyers," The
   proper force, then, of the expression enforces this attribution to
   Jesus Christ. 2. Mention is made tes epiphaneias, -- of the glorious
   appearance of him of whom the apostle speaks. That Christ is the person
   spoken of, and his employment of coming to judgment, primarily and
   directly, is confessed. This word is never used of God the Father, but
   frequently of Christ, and that, in particular, in respect of the things
   here spoken of; yea, it is properly expressive of his second coming, in
   opposition to his first coming, under contempt, scorn, and reproach: 1
   Tim. vi. 14, "Keep this commandment, mechri tes epiphaneias tou
   Christou." 2 Tim. iv. 8, "Which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall
   give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them that love
   ten epiphaneian autou." Neither, as was said, is it ever used of the
   Father, but is the word continually used to express the second coming
   of Jesus Christ. Sometimes parousia hath the same signification; and is
   therefore never ascribed to the Father. 3. It is not what may be said
   to be done, whether the glory of the Father may be said to be
   illustrated by the coming of Christ, but what is said. "The glorious
   appearance of the great God" is not the manifestation of his glory, but
   his glory is manifested in his appearance. 4. It is true, it is said
   that Christ shall "come in the glory of his Father," Matt. xvi. 27,
   Mark viii. 38; but it is nowhere said that the glory of the Father
   shall come or appear. 5. Their whole interpretation of the words will
   scarce admit of any good sense; nor can it be properly said that two
   persons come when only one comes, though that one have glory and
   authority from the other. 6. Christ shall also judge in his own name,
   and by the laws which, as Lord, he hath given. 7. There is but the same
   way of coming and appearance of the great God and our Saviour: which if
   our Saviour come really and indeed, and the great God only because he
   sends him, the one comes and the other comes not; which is not,
   doubtless, they both come.

   Grotius agrees with our catechists, but says not one word more for the
   proof of his interpretation, nor in way of exception to ours, than they
   say, as they say no more than Socinus against Bellarmine, nor he much
   more than Erasmus before him, from whom Grotius also borrowed his
   comment of Ambrose, which he urges in the exposition of this place;
   which, were it not for my peculiar respect to Erasmus, I would say were
   not honestly done, himself having proved that comment under the name of
   Ambrose to be a paltry, corrupted, depraved, foisted piece: but Grotius
   hath not a word but what hath been spoken to.

   The next testimony mentioned is Rev. i. 8, "I am Alpha and Omega, the
   beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and
   which is to come, the Almighty;" to which is added that of chap. iv. 8,
   "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to
   come."

   Q. What sayest thou to this?

   A. This place they say refers to Christ, because they suppose none is
   said to come but only Christ, for he is to come to judge the quick and
   dead. But it is to be noted, that that word which they have rendered
   "to come," may equally be rendered "is to be," as John xvi. 13, where
   the Lord says of the Spirit, which he promised to the apostles, that he
   should "show them things to come;" and Acts xviii. 21, we read that the
   feast day was "to be," in which place the Greek word is erchomenos.
   Lastly, Who is there that knows not that seeing it is said before,
   "which was, and is," this last which is added may be rendered "to be,"
   that the words in every part may be taken of existence, and not in the
   two former of existence, in the latter of coming? Neither is there any
   one who doth not observe that the eternity of God is here described,
   which comprehendeth time past, present, and to come. But that which
   discovers this gross error is that which we read in Rev. i. 4, 5,
   "Grace be to you, and peace, from him which is, which was, and which is
   to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and
   from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness;" -- from which
   testimony it appears that Jesus Christ is quite another from him which
   is, and was, and is to be, or, as they think, is to come. [328]

   1. There is not one place which they have mentioned wherein the word
   here used, erchomenos, may not properly be translated "to come;" which
   they seem to acknowledge at first to be peculiar to Christ. But, 2.
   These gentlemen make themselves and their disciples merry by persuading
   them that we have no other argument to prove these words to be spoken
   of Christ but only because he is said to be ho erchomenos: which yet,
   in conjunction with other things, is not without its weight, being as
   it were a name of the Messiah, Matt. xi. 3, from Gen. xlix. 10, [329]
   though it may be otherwise applied. 3. They are no less triumphant,
   doubtless, in their following answer, that these words describe the
   eternity of God, and therefore belong not to Christ; when the argument
   is, that Christ is God, because, amongst other things, these words
   ascribe eternity to him. Is this an answer to us, who not only believe
   him, but prove him eternal? 4. And they are upon the same pin still in
   their last expression, that these words are ascribed to the Father,
   verse 4, when they know that the argument which they have undertaken to
   answer is, that the same names are ascribed to the Son as to the
   Father, and therefore he is God equal with him. Their answer is, "This
   name is not ascribed to Christ, because it is ascribed to the Father."
   Men must beg when they can make no earnings at work. 5. We confess
   Christ to be "alius," "another," another person from the Father; not
   another God, as our catechists pretend.

   Having stopped the mouths of our catechists, we may briefly consider
   the text itself. 1. That by this expression, "Who is, and who was, and
   who is to come," the apostle expresses that name of God, Ehejeh
   ['hyh?], Exod. iii. 14, which, as the rabbins say, is of all seasons,
   and expressive of all times, is evident. To which add that other name
   of God, "Almighty," and it cannot at all be questioned but that he who
   is intended in these words is "the only true God." 2. That the words
   are here used of Jesus Christ is so undeniable from the context that
   his adversaries thought good not once to mention it. Verse 7, his
   coming is described to be in glory: "Behold, he cometh with clouds; and
   every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all
   kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him;" whereupon himself
   immediately adds the words of this testimony, "I am Alpha and Omega"
   For, (1.) They are words spoken to John by him who gave him the
   Revelation, which was Jesus Christ, verse 1. (2.) They are the words of
   him that speaks on to John, which was Jesus Christ, verse 18. (3.)
   Jesus Christ twice in this chapter afterward gives himself the same
   title, verse 11, "I am Alpha and Omega;" and verse 17, "I am the first
   and the last." But who is he? "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and,
   behold, I live for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of
   death," verse 18. He gave the Revelation, he is described, he speaks
   all always, he gives himself the same title twice again in this
   chapter.

   But our catechists think they have taken a course to prevent all this,
   and therefore have avoided the consideration of the words as they are
   placed, chap. i. 8, considering the same words in chap. iv. 8, where
   they want some of the circumstances which in this place give light to
   their application. They are not there spoken by any one that ascribes
   them to himself, but by others are ascribed "to him that sitteth upon
   the throne;" who cry (as the seraphims, Isa. vi. 3), "Holy, holy, holy,
   Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come." But yet there
   wants not evidence to evince that these words belong immediately in
   this place also to Jesus Christ; for, -- 1. They are the name, as we
   have seen, whereby not long before he revealed himself. 2. They are
   spoken of "him who sitteth upon the throne" in the midst of the
   Christian churches here represented. And if Christ be not intended in
   these words, there is no mention of his presence in his church, in that
   solemn representation of its assembly, although he promised to be in
   the "midst" of his "to the end of the world." 3. The honour that is
   here ascribed to him that is spoken of is because he is axios,
   "worthy," as the same is assigned to the Lamb by the same persons in
   the same words, chap. v. 12. So that in both these places it is Jesus
   Christ who is described: "He is, he was, he is to come" (or, as another
   place expresses it, "The same yesterday, to-day, and for ever"), "the
   Lord God Almighty."

   I shall not need to add any thing to what Grotius hath observed on
   these places. He holds with our catechists, and ascribes these titles
   and expressions to God in contradistinction to Jesus Christ, and gives
   in some observations to explain them: but for the reason of his
   exposition, wherein he knew that he dissented from the most of
   Christians, we have oude gru, so that I have nothing to do but to
   reject his authority; which, upon the experience I have of his design,
   I can most freely do.

   Proceed we to the next testimony, which is Acts xx. 28, "Feed the
   church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood." He who
   purchased the church with his blood is God; but it was Jesus Christ who
   purchased his church with Ms blood, Eph. v. 25-27, Tit. ii. 14, Heb.
   ix. 14: therefore he is God.

   Q. What dost thou answer to this?

   A. I answer, the name of "God" is not necessarily in this place
   referred to Christ, but it may be referred to God the Father, whose
   blood the apostles call that which Christ shed, in that kind of
   speaking, and for that cause, with which God, and for which cause the
   prophet says, "He who toucheth you toucheth the apple of the eye of God
   himself." For the great conjunction that is between Father and Son,
   although in essence they are altogether diverse, is the reason why the
   blood of Christ is called the blood of God the Father himself,
   especially if it be considered as shed for us; for Christ is the Lamb
   of God, that takes away the sins of the world, whence the blood shed to
   that purpose may be called the blood of God himself. Nor is it to be
   passed by in silence, that in the Syriac edition, in the place of God,
   Christ is read. [330]

   There is scarce any place in returning an answer whereunto the
   adversaries of the deity of Christ do less agree among themselves than
   about this. 1. Some say the name of God is not here taken absolutely,
   but with relation to office, and so Christ is spoken of, and called
   "God by office:" so Socin. ad Bellar. et Weik. p. 200, etc. Some say
   that the words are thus to be read, "Feed the church of God, which
   Christ hath purchased by his own blood:" so Ochinus and Lælius Socinus,
   whom Zanchius answers, "De Tribus Elohim," lib. iii. cap. vi. p. 456.
   Some flee to the Syriac translation, contrary to the constant
   consenting testimony of all famous copies of the original, all agreeing
   in the word Theou, some adding tou Kuriou. [331] So Grotius would have
   it, affirming that the manuscript he used had tou Kuriou, not telling
   them that it added Theou, which is the same with what we affirm; and
   therefore he ventures at asserting the text to be corrupted, and, in
   short writing, thou to be crept in for chou [manuscript contractions
   for Theou and Christou], contrary to the faith and consent of all
   ancient copies: which is all he hath to plead. 2. Our catechists know
   not what to say: "Necessarily this word God' is not to be referred to
   Christ; it may be referred to God the Father." Give an instance of the
   like phrase of speech, and take the interpretation. Can it be said that
   one's blood was shed when it was not shed, but another's? and there is
   no mention that that other's blood was shed. 3. If the Father's blood
   was shed, or said truly to be shed, because Christ's blood was shed,
   then you may say that God the Father died, and was crucified under
   Pontius Pilate, and that God the Father rose from the dead; that he was
   dead, and is alive; that that blood that was shed was not Christ's, but
   somebody's else that he loved, and was near unto him. 4. There is no
   analogy between that of the prophet, of the "apple of God's eye," and
   this here spoken of. Uncontrollably a metaphor must there be allowed;
   -- here is no metaphor insisted on; but that which is the blood of
   Christ is called the blood of God, and Christ not to be that God is
   their interpretation. There, divers persons are spoken of, God and
   believers; here, one only, that did that which is expressed. And all
   the force of this exposition lies in this, "There is a figurative
   expression in one place, the matter spoken of requiring it, therefore
   here must be a figure admitted also," where there is not the same
   reason. What is this but to "make the Scripture a nose of wax?" The
   work of "redeeming the church with his blood' is ever ascribed to
   Christ as peculiar to him, constantly, without exception, and never to
   God the Father; neither would our adversaries allow it to be so here,
   but that they know not how to stand before the testimony wherewith they
   are pressed. 5. If, because of the conjunction that is between God the
   Father and Christ, the blood of Christ may be called the blood of God
   the Father, then the hunger and thirst of Christ, his dying and being
   buried, his rising again, may be called the hunger and thirst of God
   the Father, his sweating, dying, and rising. And he is a strange
   natural and proper Son who hath a quite different nature and essence
   from his own proper Father, as is here affirmed. 6. Christ is called
   "The Lamb of God," as answering and fulfilling all the sacrifices that
   were made to God of old; and if the blood of Christ may be called the
   blood of God the Father because he appointed it to be shed for us, then
   the blood of any sacrifice was also the blood of the man that appointed
   it to be shed, yea, of God, who ordained it. The words are, Ekklesian
   tou Theou e periepoiesato dia tou idiou haimatos. If any words in the
   world can properly express that it is one and the same person who is
   intended, that it is his own blood properly that bought the church with
   it, surely these words do it to the full. Christ, then, is God.

   The next place they are pleased to take notice of, as to this head of
   testimonies about the names of God, is 1 John iii. 16, "Hereby perceive
   we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us." He who laid
   down his life for us was God; that is, he was so when he laid down his
   life for us, and not made a God since.

   Q. To the eighth what sayest thou?

   A. First take this account, that neither in any Greek edition (but only
   the Complutensis) nor in the Syriac the word "God" is found But suppose
   that this word were found in all copies, were therefore this word "he"
   to be referred to "God"? No, doubtless; not only for that reason which
   we gave a little before, in answer to the third testimony, that such
   words are not always referred to the next person, but, moreover,
   because John doth often in this epistle refer the Greek word ekeinos to
   him who was named long before, as in the 3d, 5th, and 7th verses of
   this chapter. [332]

   1. Our catechists do very faintly adhere to the first exception, about
   the word Theou [333] in the original, granting that it is in some
   copies, and knowing that the like phrase is used elsewhere, and that
   the sense in this place necessarily requires the presence of that word.
   2. Supposing it as they do, we deny that this is a very just exception
   which they insist upon, that as a relative may sometimes, and in some
   cases, where the sense is evident, be referred to the remote
   antecedent, therefore it may or ought to be so in any place, contrary
   to the propriety of grammar, where there are no circumstances enforcing
   such a construction, but all things requiring the proper sense of it.
   3. It is allowed of only where several persons are spoken of
   immediately before, which here are not, one only being intimated or
   expressed. 4. They can give no example of the word "God" going before,
   and ekeinos following after, where ekeinos is referred to any thing or
   person more remote; much less here, where the apostle, having treated
   of God and the love of God, draws an argument from the love of God to
   enforce our love of one another. 5. In the places they point unto,
   ekeinos in every one of them is referred to the next and immediate
   antecedent, as will be evident to our reader upon the first view.

   Give them their great associate and we have done: "?Ekeinos hic est
   Christus, ut supra ver. 5, subintelligendum hic autem est, hoc Christum
   fecisse Deo sic decernente nostri causa quod expressum est, Rom. v. 8."
   That ekeinos is Christ is confessed; but the word being a relative, and
   expressive of some person before mentioned, we say it relates unto
   Theou, the word going immediately before it. No, says Grotius, but "the
   sense is, Herein appeared the love of God, that by his appointment
   Christ died for us.'"That Christ laid down his life for us by the
   appointment of the Father is most true, but that that is the intendment
   of this place, or that the grammatical construction of the words will
   bear any such sense, we deny.

   And this is what they have to except to the testimonies which
   themselves choose to insist on to give in their exceptions to, as to
   the names of Jehovah and God being ascribed unto Jesus Christ; which
   having vindicated from all their sophistry, I shall shut up the
   discourse of them with this argument, which they afford us for the
   confirmation of the sacred truth contended for: He who is Jehovah, God,
   the only true God, etc., he is God by nature; but thus is Jesus Christ
   God, and these are the names the Scripture calls and knows him by:
   therefore he is so, God by nature, blessed for ever.

   That many more testimonies to this purpose may be produced, and have
   been so by those who have pleaded the deity of Christ against its
   opposers, both of old and of late, is known to all that inquire after
   such things. I content myself to vindicate what they have put in
   exceptions unto.

   [331] It is necessary to state that this is far from being correct.
   Eminent critics, such as Bengel, Matthai, and Scholz, it is true,
   decide for Theou, but Griesbach, Lachman, and Tischendorf, give tou
   Kuriou as the proper reading. The leading manuscripts A, C, D, E, are
   in favour of the latter; but Tischendorf has now proved that manuscript
   B, commonly known as the Vatican manuscript, and formerly supposed to
   agree with them, on the contrary, has Theou, a prima manu. All the
   evidence cannot be weighed and discussed in this note, but the
   authority for Theou is, on the whole, sufficient to establish it as the
   true reading. -- Ed.

   [332] "Ad octavum veto quid? -- Primum igitur sic habeto, neque in
   Græca editione uila hæc (excepta Complutensi), nec in editione Syriaca,
   vocem Deus haberi. Verum etiamsi vex haberetur in omnibus exemplaribus,
   num idcireo ea vex the ad Deum erit referenda? Non certe; non solum ob
   eam causam quam paulo superius attulimus, in responsione ad testimonium

   epistola sæpe ad eum refert, qui longe antea nominatus fuerat, ut et 3,
   5, et 7, versu ejusdem capitis in Græco apparet."

   [333] It cannot now be questioned that there is no authority for the
   insertion of Theou. Even our authorized version consigns it to Italics,
   as a supplement, and not in the original. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter XI.

   Of the work of creation assigned to Jesus Christ, etc. -- The
   confirmation of his eternal deity from thence.

   The scriptures which assign the creating of all things to Jesus Christ
   they propose as the next testimony of his deity whereunto they desire
   to give in their exceptions. To these they annex them wherein it is
   affirmed that he brought the people of Israel out of Egypt, and that he
   was with them in the wilderness; with one particular out of Isaiah,
   compared with the account given of it in the gospel, about the
   prophet's seeing the glory of Christ. Of those which are of the first
   sort they instance in John i. 3, 10; Col. i. 16, 17; Heb. i. 2, 10-12.

   The first and second of these I have already vindicated, in the
   consideration of them as they lay in their conjuncture with them going
   before in verse 1; proceed we therefore to the third, which is Col. i.
   16, 17, "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
   that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
   dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by
   him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things
   consist."

   1. That these words are spoken of Jesus Christ is acknowledged. The
   verses foregoing prevent all question thereof: "He hath translated us
   into the kingdom of his dear Son: in whom we have redemption through
   his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the
   invisible God, the first-born of every creature: for by him were all
   things," etc.

   2. In what sense Christ is the "image of the invisible God," even the
   "express image of his Father's person," shall be afterward declared.
   The other part of the description of him belongs to that which we have
   in hand. He is prototokos pases ktiseos, -- "the first-born of every
   creature;" that is, before them all, above them all, heir of them all,
   and so none of them. It is not said he is protoktistos, first created,
   but prototokos, the first-born. Now, the term "first" in the Scripture
   represents either what follows, and so denotes an order in the things
   spoken of, he that is the first being one of them, as Adam was the
   first man; or it respects things going before, in which sense it denies
   all order or series of things in the same kind. So God is said to be
   the "first," Isa. xli. 4, because before him there was none, Isa.
   xliii. 10. And in this sense is Christ the "first-born," -- so the
   first-born as to be the "only-begotten Son of God," John iii. 18. This
   the apostle proves and gives an account of in the following verses; for
   the clearing of his intendment wherein a few things may be premised:--

   1. Though he speaks of him who is Mediator, and describes him, yet he
   speaks not of him as Mediator; for that he enters upon verse 18, "And
   he is the head of the body, the church," etc.

   2. That the things whose creation is here assigned unto Jesus Christ
   are evidently contradistinguished to the things of the church, or new
   creation, which are mentioned verse 18. Here he is said to be the
   "first-born of every creature;" there, the "first-born from the dead;"
   -- here, to make all things; there, to be "the head of the body, the
   church."

   3. The creation of all things simply and absolutely is most
   emphatically expressed:-- (1.) In general: "By him all things were
   created." (2.) A distribution is made of those "all things" into "all
   things that are in heaven and that are in earth;" which is the common
   expression of all things that were made at the beginning, Exod. xx. 11,
   Acts iv. 24. (3.) A description is given of the things so created
   according to two adjuncts which divide all creatures whatever, --
   whether they are "visible or invisible." (4.) An enumeration is in
   particular made of one sort, of things invisible; which being of
   greatest eminency and dignity, might seem, if any, to be exempted from
   the state and condition of being created by Jesus Christ: "Whether they
   be thrones," etc. (5.) This distribution and enumeration being closed,
   the general assumption is again repeated, as having received
   confirmation from what was said before: "All things were created by
   him," of what sort soever, whether expressed in the enumeration
   foregoing or no; all things were created by him. They were created for
   him eis auton, as it is said of the Father, Rom. xi. 36; which, Rev.
   iv. 11, is said to be for his will and "pleasure." (6.) For a farther
   description of him, verse 17, his pre-existence before all things, and
   his providence in supporting them and continuing that being to them
   which he gave them by creation, are asserted: "And he is before all
   things, and by him all things consist."

   Let us consider, then, what is excepted hereunto by them with whom we
   have to do. Thus they, --

   Q. What dost thou answer to this place?

   A. Besides this, that this testimony speaks of Christ as of the mediate
   and second cause, it is manifest the words "were created" are used in
   Scripture, not only concerning the old, but also the new creation; of
   which you have an example, Eph. ii. 10, 15, James i. 18. Moreover, that
   these words, "All things in heaven and in earth," are not used for all
   things altogether, appeareth, not only from the words subjoined a
   little after, verse 20, where the apostle saith, that "by him are all
   things reconciled in heaven and in earth," but also from those words
   themselves, wherein the apostle said not that the heavens and earth
   were created, but "all things that are in heaven and in earth."

   Q. But how dost thou understand that testimony?

   A. On that manner wherein all things that are in heaven and in earth
   were reformed by Christ, after God raised him from the dead, and by him
   translated into another state and condition; and this whereas God gave
   Christ to be head to angels and men, who before acknowledged God only
   for their lord. [334]

   What there is either in their exceptions or exposition of weight to
   take off this evident testimony shall briefly be considered.

   1. The first exception, of the kind of causality which is here ascribed
   to Christ, hath already been considered and removed, by manifesting the
   very same kind of expression, about the same things, to be used
   concerning God the Father. 2. Though the word creation be used
   concerning the new creation, yet it is in places where it is evidently
   and distinctly spoken of in opposition to the former state wherein they
   were who were so created. But here, as was above demonstrated, the old
   creation is spoken of in direct distinction from the new, which the
   apostle describes and expresses in other terms, verse 20; if that may
   be called the new creation which lays a foundation of it, as the death
   of Christ doth of regeneration; and unless it be in that cause, the
   work of the new creation is not spoken of at all in this place. 3.
   Where Christ is said "to reconcile all things unto himself, whether
   things in earth, or things in heaven," he speaks plainly and evidently
   of another work, distinct from that which he had described in these
   verses; and whereas reconciliation supposes a past enmity, the "all
   things" mentioned in the 20th verse can be none but those which were
   sometime at enmity with God. Now, none but men that ever had any enmity
   against God, or were at enmity with him, were ever reconciled to God.
   It is, then, men in heaven and earth, to whose reconciliation, in their
   several generations, the efficacy of the blood of Christ did extend,
   that are there intended. 4. Not [only] heaven and earth are named, but
   "all things in them," as being most immediately expressive of the
   apostle's purpose, who, naming all things in general, chose to instance
   in angels and men, as also insisting on the expression which is used
   concerning the creation of all things in sundry places, as hath been
   showed, though he mentions not all the words in them used.

   [As] for the exposition they give of these words, it is most
   ridiculous; for, -- 1. The apostle doth not speak of Christ as he is
   exalted after his resurrection, but describes him in his divine nature
   and being. 2. To translate out of one condition into another is not to
   create the thing so translated, though another new thing it may be.
   When a man is made a magistrate, we do not say he is made a man but he
   is made a magistrate. 3. The new creation, which they here affirm to be
   spoken of, is by no means to be accommodated unto angels. In both the
   places mentioned by themselves, and in all places where it is spoken
   of, it is expressive of a change from bad to good, from evil actions to
   grace, and is the same with regeneration or conversion, which cannot be
   ascribed to angels, who never sinned nor lost their first habitation.
   4. The dominion of Christ over angels and men is nowhere called a new
   creation, nor is there any colour or pretence why it should be so
   expressed. [335] 5. The new creation is "in Christ," 2 Cor. v. 17; but
   to be "in Christ" is to be implanted into him by the Holy Spirit by
   believing, which by no means can be accommodated to angels. 6. If only
   the dominion of Christ be intended, then, whereas Christ's dominion is,
   according to our adversaries (Smalc. de Divin. Christi, cap. xvi.),
   extended over all creatures, men, angels, devils, and all other things
   in the world, men, angels, devils, and all things, are new creatures!
   7. Socinus says that by "principalities and powers" devils are
   intended. And what advancement may they be supposed to have obtained by
   the new creation? The devils were created, that is, delivered! There is
   no end of the folly and absurdities of this interpretation: I shall
   spend no more words about it. Our argument from this place stands firm
   and unshaken.

   Grotius abides by his friends in the interpretation of this place,
   wresting it to the new creature and the dominion of Christ over all,
   against all the reasons formerly insisted on, and with no other
   argument than what he was from the Socinians supplied withal. His words
   on the place are:-- "It is certain that all things were created by the
   Word; but those things that go before show that Christ is here treated
   of, which is the name of a man, as Chrysostom also understood this
   place. But he would have it that the world was made for Christ, in a
   sense not corrupt; but on the account of that which went before,
   ektisthe is better interpreted were ordained,' or obtained a certain
   new state.'?" [336] So he, in almost the very words of Socinus. But, --

   1. In what sense "all things were created by the Word," and what
   Grotius intends by the "Word," I shall speak elsewhere. 2. Is Christ
   the name of a man only? or of him who is only a man? Or is he a man
   only as he is Christ? If he would have spoken out to this, we might
   have had some light into his meaning in many other places of his
   Annotations. The apostle tells us that Christ is "over all, God blessed
   for ever," Rom. ix. 5; and that Jesus Christ was "declared to be the
   Son of God, by the resurrection from the dead," chap. i. 4. If "Christ"
   denote the person of our mediator, Christ is God, and what is spoken of
   Christ is spoken of him who is God. But this is that which is aimed at:
   The Word, or Wisdom of God, bears eminent favour towards that man Jesus
   Christ; but that he was any more than a man, that is, the union of the
   natures of God and man in one person, is denied. 3. The words before
   are so spoken of Christ as that they call him the Son of God, and the
   image of the invisible God, and the first-born of the creation; which
   though he was who was a man, yet he was not as he was a man. 4. All the
   arguments we have insisted on, and farther shall insist on (by God's
   assistance), to prove the deity of Christ, with all the texts of
   Scripture wherein it is plainly affirmed, do evince the vanity of this
   exception, "Christ is the name of a man; therefore the things spoken of
   him are not proper and peculiar to God." 5. Into Chrysostom's
   exposition of this place I shall not at present inquire, though I am
   not without reason to think he is wronged; but that the word here
   translated "created" may not, cannot be rendered ordained, or placed in
   a new state and condition, I have before sufficiently evinced, neither
   doth Grotius add any thing to evince his interpretation of the place,
   or to remove what is objected against it.

   1. He tells us that of that sense of the word ktizein, he hath spoken
   in his Prolegomena to the Gospels; and urges Eph. ii. 10, 13, iii. 9,
   iv. 24, to prove the sense proposed. (1.) It is confessed that God doth
   sometimes express the exceeding greatness of his power and efficacy of
   his grace in the regeneration of a sinner, and enabling him to live to
   God, by the word "create," -- whence such a person is sometimes called
   the "new creature," -- according to the many promises of the Old
   Testament, of creating a new heart in the elect, whom he would take
   into covenant with himself, -- a truth which wraps that in its bowels
   whereunto Grotius was no friend; but that this new creation can be
   accommodated to the things here spoken of is such a figment as so
   learned a man might have been ashamed of. The constant use of the word
   in the New Testament is that which is proper, and that which in this
   place we insist on: as Rom. i. 25; 1 Tim. iv. 3; Rev. iv. 11. (2.) Eph.
   ii. 10 speaks of the "new creature" in the sense declared; which is not
   illustrated by verse 13, which is quite of another import. Chap. iv. 24
   is to the same purpose. Chap. iii. 9, the creation of all things,
   simply and absolutely, is ascribed to God; which to wrest to a new
   creation there is no reason, but what arises from opposition to Jesus
   Christ, because it is ascribed also to him.

   2. The latter part of the verse he thus illustrates, or rather
   obscures: Ta panta di autou, intellige omnia quæ ad novam creationem
   pertinent." How causelessly, how without ground, how contrary to the
   words and scope of the place, hath been showed. Kai eis auton ektistai,
   propter ipsum, ut ipse omnibus illis præesset, Rev. v. 13, Heb. ii. 8.
   This is to go forward in an ill way. (1.) What one instance can he give
   of this sense of the expression opened? The words, as hath been showed,
   are used of God the Father, Rom. xi. 36, and are expressive of absolute
   sovereignty, as Rev. iv. 11. (2.) The texts cited by him to exemplify
   the sense of this place (for they are not instanced in to explain the
   phrase, which is not used in them) do quite evert his whole gloss. In
   both places the dominion of Christ is asserted over the whole creation;
   and particularly, in Rev. v. 13, things in heaven, earth, under the
   earth, and in the sea, are recounted. I desire to know whether all
   these are made new creatures or no. If not, it is not the dominion of
   Christ over them that is here spoken of; for he speaks only of them
   that he created.

   Of the 17th verse he gives the same exposition: Kai autos esti pro
   panton, id est, A et O, ut ait Apoc. i. 8, pro panton, intellige ut jam
   diximus." Not contented to pervert this place, he draws another into
   society with it, wherein he is more highly engaged than our catechists,
   who confess that place robe spoken of the eternity of God: "Kai ta
   panta en auto sunesteke Et hæc vox de veteri creatione ad novam
   traducitur. Vid. 2 Pet. iii. 5." Prove it by any one instance; or, if
   that may not be done, beg no more in a matter of this importance. In
   Peter it is used of the existence of all things by the power of God, in
   and upon their creation; and so also here, but spoken with reference to
   Jesus Christ, who is "God over all, blessed for ever." And so much for
   the vindication of this testimony.

   Heb. i. 2 is nextly mentioned, "By whom also he made the worlds."

   That these words are spoken of Christ is not denied. They are too
   express to bear any exception on that account. That God is said to make
   the world by Christ doth not at all prejudice what we intend from this
   place. God could no way make the world by Christ but as he was his own
   eternal Wisdom; which exempts him from the condition of a creature.
   Besides, as it is said that God made the world by him, denoting the
   subordination of the Son to the Father and his being his Wisdom, as he
   is described Prov. viii.; so also the Word is said to make the world,
   as a principal efficient cause himself, John i. 3 and Heb. i. 10. The
   word here used is aionas. That aion is of various acceptations in the
   New Testament is known. A duration of time, an age, eternity, are
   sometimes expressed thereby; the world, the beginning of it, or its
   creation, as John ix. 32. In this place it signifies not "time" simply
   and solely, but the things created in the "beginning of time" and "in
   all times;" and so expressly the word is used, Heb. xi. 3. The framing
   aionon, is the creation of the world; which by faith we come to know.
   "The worlds," that is, the world and all in it, were made by Christ.

   Let us now hear our catechists:--

   Q. How dost thou answer to this testimony?

   A. On this manner, that it is here openly written, not that Christ
   made, but that God by Christ made the worlds. It is also confessed that
   the word "secula" may signify not only the ages past and present, but
   also to come. But that here it signifies things future is demonstrated
   from hence, that the same author affirmeth that by him whom God
   appointed heir of all things he made the worlds: for Jesus of Nazareth
   was not made heir of all things before he raised him from the dead;
   which appears from hence, because then all power in heaven and in earth
   was given him of God the Father; in which grant of power, and not in
   any other thing, that inheritance of all things is contained. [337]

   1. For the first exception, it hath been sufficiently spoken to
   already; and if nothing else but the pre-existence of Christ unto the
   whole creation be hence proved, yet the cause of our adversaries is by
   it destroyed for ever. This exception might do some service to the
   Arians; to Socinians it will do none at all. 2. The word "secula"
   signifies not things future anywhere. This is gratis dictum, and cannot
   be proved by any instance. "The world to come" may do so, but "the
   world" simply doth not. That it doth not so signify in this place is
   evident from these considerations:-- (1.) These words, "By whom he made
   the worlds," are given as a reason why God made him "heir of all
   things," -- even because by him he made all things; which is no reason
   at all, if you understand only heavenly things by "the worlds" here:
   which also removes the last exception of our catechists, that Christ
   was appointed heir of all things antecedently to his making of the
   world; which is most false, this being given as a reason of that, --
   his making of the world of his being made heir of all things. Besides,
   this answer, that Christ made not the world until his resurrection, is
   directly opposite to that formerly given by them to Col. i. 16, where
   they would have him to be said to make all things because of the
   reconciliation he made by his death, verse 20. (2.) The same word or
   expression in the same epistle is used for the world in its creation,
   as was before observed, chap. xi. 3; which makes it evident that the
   apostle in both places intends the same. (3.) Aion is nowhere used
   absolutely for "the world to come;" which being spoken of in this
   epistle, is once called oikoumenen ten mellousan, chap. ii. 5, and
   aiona mellonta, chap. vi. 5, but nowhere absolutely aiona or aionas.
   (4.) "The world to come" is nowhere said to be made, nor is this
   expression used of it. It is said, chap. ii. 5, to be put into
   subjection to Christ, not to be made by him; and chap. vi. 5, the
   "powers" of it are mentioned, not its creation. (5.) That is said to be
   made by Christ which he upholds with the word of his power; but this is
   said simply to be all things: "He upholdeth all things by the word of
   his power," chap. i. 3. (6.) This plainly answers the former
   expressions insisted on, "He made the world," "He made all things,"
   etc. So that this text also lies as a two-edged sword at the very heart
   of the Socinian cause.

   Grotius seeing that this interpretation could not be made good, yet
   being no way willing to grant that making of the world is ascribed to
   Christ, relieves his friends with one evasion more than they were aware
   of. It is, that di' hou, "by whom," is put for di' o, "for whom," or
   for whose sake; and epoiese is to be rendered by the preterpluperfect
   tense, "he had made." And so the sense is, "God made the world for
   Christ;" which answereth an old saying of the Hebrews, "That the world
   was made for the Messiah."

   But what will not great wits give a colour to! 1. Grotius is not able
   to give me one instance in the whole New Testament where di' hou is
   taken for di' o: and if it should be so anywhere, himself would confess
   that it must have some cogent circumstance to enforce that
   construction, as all places must have where we go off from the
   propriety of the word. 2. If di' hou be put for di' o dia must be put
   for eis, as, in the opinion of Beza, it is once in the place quoted by
   Grotius, and so signify the final cause, as he makes di' hon, to do.
   Now, the Holy Ghost doth expressly distinguish between these two in
   this business of making the world, Rom. xi. 36, Di autou kai eis auton
   ta panta: so that, doubtless, in the same matter, one of these is not
   put for the other. 3. Why must epoiese be "condiderat?" and what
   example can be given of so rendering that aoristus? If men may say what
   they please, without taking care to give the least probability to what
   they say, these things may pass. 4. If the apostle must be supposed to
   allude to any opinion or saying of the Jews, it is much more probable
   that he alluded, in the word aionas, which he uses, to the threefold
   world they mention in their liturgy, -- the lower, middle, and higher
   world, or [residence of the] souls of the blessed, -- or the fourfold,
   mentioned by Rab. Alschech: "Messias prosperabitur, vocabulum est quod
   quatuor mundos complectitur; qui sunt mundus inferior, mundus
   angelorum, mundus sphærarum, et mundus supremus," etc. But of this
   enough.

   Though this last testimony be sufficient to confound all gainsayers,
   and to stop the mouths of men of common ingenuity, yet it is evident
   that our catechists are more perplexed with that which follows in the
   same chapter; which, therefore, they insist longer upon than on any one
   single testimony besides, -- with what success comes now to be
   considered.

   The words are, Heb. i. 10-12, "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid
   the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine
   hands: they shall perish, but thou remainest; and they all shall wax
   old as doth a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and
   they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not
   fail." That these words of the psalmist are spoken concerning Christ we
   have the testimony of the apostle applying them to him; wherein we are
   to acquiesce. The thing also is clear in itself, for they are added in
   his discourse of the deliverance of the church; which work is peculiar
   to the Son of God, and where that is mentioned, it is he who eminently
   is intended. Now, very many of the arguments wherewith the deity of
   Christ is confirmed are wrapped up in these words:-- 1. His name,
   Jehovah, is asserted: "Thou, Lord;" for of him the psalmist speaks,
   though he repeats not that word. 2. His eternity and pre-existence to
   his incarnation: "Thou, Lord, in the beginning," -- that is, before the
   world was made. 3. His omnipotence and divine power in the creation of
   all things: "Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the
   heavens are the works of thine hands." 4. His immutability: "Thou art
   the same, and thy years shall not fail;" as Mal. iii. 6. 5. His
   sovereignty and dominion over all: "As a vesture shalt thou fold them
   up, and they shall be changed." Let us now see what darkness they are
   able to pour forth upon this sun shining in its strength.

   Q. What dost thou answer to this testimony?

   A. To this testimony I answer, that it is not to be understood of
   Christ, but of God. But because this writer refers it to the Son of
   God, it is to be considered that the discourse in this testimony is
   expressly about not one, but two things chiefly. The one is the
   creation of heaven and earth; the other, the abolishing of created
   things. Now, that that author doth not refer the first unto Christ is
   hence evident, because in that chapter he proposeth to himself to
   demonstrate the excellency of Christ above the angels; not that which
   he hath of himself, but that which he had by inheritance, and whereby
   he is made better than the angels, as is plain to any one, verse 4; of
   which kind of excellence seeing that the creation of heaven and earth
   is not, nor can be, it appeareth manifestly that this testimony is not
   urged by this writer to prove that Christ created heaven and earth.
   Seeing, therefore, the first part cannot be referred to Christ, it
   appeareth that the latter only is to be referred to him, and that
   because by him God will abolish heaven and earth, when by him he shall
   execute the last judgment, whereby the excellency of Christ above
   angels shall be so conspicuous that the angels themselves shall in that
   very thing serve him. And seeing this last speech could not be
   understood without those former words, wherein mention is made of
   heaven and earth, being joined to them by this word "they," therefore
   the author had a necessity to make mention of them also; for if other
   holy writers do after that manner cite the testimonies of Scripture,
   compelled by no necessity, much more was this man to do it, being
   compelled thereunto.

   Q. But where have the divine writers done this?

   A. Amongst many other testimonies take Matt. xii. 18-21, where it is
   most manifest that only verse 19 belongeth to the purpose of the
   evangelist, when he would prove why Christ forbade that he should be
   made known. So Acts ii. 17-21, where also verses 17, 18, only do make
   to the apostle's purpose, which is to prove that the Holy Ghost was
   poured forth on the disciples; and there also, verses 25-28, where
   verse 27 only is to the purpose, the apostle proving only that it was
   impossible that Christ should be detained of death. Lastly, in this
   very chapter, verse 9, where these words, "Thou hast loved
   righteousness, and hated iniquity," are used, it is evident that they
   belong not to the thing which the apostle proveth, which is that Christ
   was made more excellent than the angels. [338]

   That in all this discourse there is not any thing considerable but the
   horrible boldness of these men, in corrupting and perverting the word
   of God, will easily to the plainest capacity be demonstrated; for which
   end I offer the ensuing animadversions:--

   1. To say these things are not spoken of Christ, because they are
   spoken of God, is a shameless begging of the thing in question. We
   prove Christ to be God because those things are spoken of him that are
   proper to God only.

   2. It is one thing in general that is spoken of, namely, the deity of
   Christ; which is proved by one testimony, from Ps. cii., concerning one
   property of Christ, namely, his almighty power, manifested in the
   making of all thins, and disposing them in his sovereign will, himself
   abiding unchangeable.

   3. It is shameless impudence in these gentlemen, to take upon them to
   say that this part of the apostle's testimony which he produceth is to
   his purpose, that not; as if they were wiser than the Holy Ghost, and
   knew Paul's design better than himself.

   4. The foundation of their whole evasion is most false, -- namely, that
   all the proofs of the excellency of Christ above angels, insisted on by
   the apostle, belong peculiarly to what he is said to receive by
   inheritance. The design of the apostle is to prove the excellency of
   Christ in himself, and then in comparison of angels: and therefore,
   before the mention of what he received by inheritance, he affirms
   directly that by him "God made the worlds;" and to this end it is most
   evident that this testimony, that he created heaven and earth, is most
   directly subservient.

   5. Christ also hath his divine nature by inheritance, -- that is, he
   was eternally begotten of the essence of his Father, and is thence by
   right of inheritance his Son, as the apostle proves from Ps. ii. 7.

   6. Our catechists speak not according to their own principles when they
   make a difference between what Christ had from himself and what he had
   from inheritance, for they suppose he had nothing but by divine grant
   and voluntary concession, which they make the inheritance here spoken
   of; nor according to ours, who say not that the Son, as the Son, is a
   seipso, or hath any thing a seipso; and so know not what they say.

   7. There is not, then, the least colour or pretence of denying this
   first part of the testimony to belong to Christ. The whole is spoken of
   to the same purpose, to the same person, and belongs to the same matter
   in general; and that first expression is, if not only, yet mainly and
   chiefly, effectual to confirm the intendment of the apostle, proving
   directly that Christ is better and more excellent than the angels, in
   that he is Jehovah, that made heaven and earth, they are but his
   creatures, -- as God often compares himself with others. In the psalm,
   the words respect chiefly the making of heaven and earth; and these
   words are applied to our Saviour. That the two works of making and
   abolishing the world should be assigned distinctly unto two persons
   there is no pretence to affirm. This boldness, indeed, is intolerable.

   8. To abolish the world is no less a work of almighty power than to
   make it, nor can it be done by any but him that made it, and this
   confessedly is ascribed to Christ; and both alike belong to the
   asserting of the excellency of God above all creatures, which is here
   aimed to be done.

   9. The reason given why the first words, which are nothing to the
   purpose, are cited with the latter, is a miserable begging of the thing
   in question; yea, the first words are chiefly and eminently to the
   apostle's purpose, as hath been showed. We dare not say only; for the
   Holy Ghost knew better than we what was to his purpose, though our
   catechists be wiser in their own conceits than he. Neither is there any
   reason imaginable why the apostle should rehearse more words here out
   of the psalm than were directly to the business he had in hand, seeing
   how many testimonies he cites, and some of them very briefly, leaving
   them to be supplied from the places whence they are taken.

   10. That others of the holy writers do urge testimonies not to their
   purpose, or beyond what they need, is false in itself, and a bold
   imputation of weakness to the penmen of the Holy Ghost. The instances
   hereof given by our adversaries are not at all to the purpose which
   they are pursuing; for, --

   (1.) In no one of them is there a testimony cited whereof one part
   should concern one person, and another another, as is here pretended;
   -- and without farther process this is sufficient to evince this
   evasion of impertinency; for nothing will amount to the interpretation
   they enforce on this place but the producing of some place of the New
   Testament where a testimony is cited out of the Old, speaking
   throughout of the same person, whereof the one part belongs to him and
   the other not, although that which they say doth not belong to him be
   most proper for the confirmation of what is affirmed of him, and what
   the whole is brought in proof of.

   (2.) There is not any of the places instanced in by them wherein the
   whole of the words is not directly to the purpose in hand, although
   some of them are more immediately suited to the occasion on which the
   whole testimony is produced, as it were easy to manifest by the
   consideration of the several places.

   (3.) These words, "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity,"
   are not mentioned to prove immediately the excellency of Christ above
   angels, but his administration of his kingdom, on which account, among
   others, he is so excellent; and thereunto they are most proper.

   And this is the issue of their attempt against this testimony; which,
   being thus briefly vindicated, is sufficient alone of itself to consume
   with its brightness all the opposition which, from the darkness of hell
   or men, is made against the deity of Christ.

   And yet we have one more to consider before this text be dismissed.
   Grotius is nibbling at this testimony also. His words are: "Again, that
   which is spoken of God he applies to the Messiah; because it was
   confessed among the Hebrews that this world was created for the
   Messiah's sake (whence I should think that ethemeliosas is rightly to
   be understood, Thou wast the cause why it was founded;' -- and, The
   heavens are the works of thy hands;' that is, They were made for
   thee'), and that a new and better world should be made by him." [339]
   So he.

   This is not the first time we have met with this conceit, and I wish
   that it had sufficed this learned man to have framed his Old Testament
   annotations to rabbinical traditions, that the New might have escaped.
   But jacta est alea. 1. I say, then, that the apostle doth not apply
   that to one person which was spoken of another, but asserts the words
   in the psalm to be spoken of him concerning whom he treats, and thence
   proves his excellency, which is the business he hath in hand. It is not
   to adorn Christ with titles which were not due to him (which to do were
   robbery), but to prove by testimonies that were given of him that he is
   no less than he affirmed him to be, even "God, blessed for ever." 2.
   Let any man in his right wits consider this interpretation, and try
   whether he can persuade himself to receive it: Ethemeliosas su Kurie,
   -- "For thee, O Lord, were the foundations of the earth laid, and the
   heavens are the works of thy hands;" that is, "They were made for
   thee." Any man may thus make quidlibet ex quolibet; but whether with
   due reverence to the word of God I question. 3. It is not about the
   sense of the Hebrew particles that we treat (and yet the learned man
   cannot give one clear instance of what he affirms), but of the design
   of the Holy Ghost in the psalm and in this place of the Hebrews,
   applying these words to Christ. 4. I marvel he saw not that this
   interpretation doth most desperately cut its own throat, the parts of
   it being at an irreconcilable difference among themselves: for, in the
   first place, he says the words are spoken of God, and applied to the
   Messiah, and then proves the sense of them to be such that they cannot
   be spoken of God at all, but merely of the Messiah; for to that sense
   doth he labour to wrest both the Hebrew and Greek texts. Methinks the
   words being spoken of God, and not of the Messiah, but only fitted to
   him by the apostle, there is no need to say that "Thou hast laid the
   foundation of the earth," is, "It was laid for thy sake;" and, "The
   heavens are the works of thy hands," that is, "They were made for
   thee," seeing they are properly spoken of God. This one rabbinical
   figment of the world's being made for the Messiah is the engine whereby
   the learned man turns about and perverts the sense of this whole
   chapter. In brief, if either the plain sense of the words or the
   intendment of the Holy Ghost in this place be of any account, yea, if
   the apostle deals honestly and sincerely, and speaks to what he doth
   propose, and urges that which is to his purpose, and doth not falsely
   apply that to Christ which was never spoken of him, this learned gloss
   is directly contrary to the text.

   And these are the testimonies given to the creation of all things by
   Christ, which our catechists thought good to produce to examination.

Chapter XII.

   All-ruling and disposing providence assigned unto Christ, and his
   eternal Godhead thence farther confirmed, with other testimonies
   thereof.

   That Christ is that God who made all things hath been proved by the
   undeniable testimonies in the last chapter insisted on. That, as the
   great and wise Creator of all things, he doth also govern, rule, and
   dispose of the things by him created, is another evidence of his
   eternal power and Godhead, some testimonies whereof, in that order of
   procedure which by our catechists is allotted unto us, come now to be
   considered.

   The first they propose is taken from Heb. i. 3, where the words spoken
   of Christ are, Pheron te ta panta to rhemati tes dunameos hautou, --
   "Upholding all things by the word of his power."

   He who "upholdeth all things by the word of his power" is God. This is
   ascribed to God as his property; and by none but by him who is God by
   nature can it be performed. Now, this is said expressly of Jesus
   Christ: "Who being the brightness of his Father's glory, and the
   express image of his person, upholding all things by the word of his
   power, when he had by himself purged our sins," etc.

   This place, or the testimony therein given to the divine power of Jesus
   Christ, they seek thus to elude:--

   The word here," all things," doth not, no more than in many other
   places, signify all things universally without exception, but is
   referred to those things only which belong to the kingdom of Christ; of
   which it may truly be said that the Lord Jesus "beareth," that is,
   conserveth," all things by the word of his power." But that the word"
   all things" is in this place referred unto those things only appeareth
   sufficiently from the subject-matter itself of it. Moreover, the word
   which this writer useth, "to bear," doth rather signify governing or
   administration than preservation, as these words annexed, "By the word
   of his power," seem to intimate. [340]

   This indeed is jejune, and almost unworthy of these men, if any thing
   may be said so to be; for, -- 1. Why is ta panta here "the things of
   the kingdom of Christ"? It is the express description of the person of
   Christ, as" the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image
   of his person," that the apostle is treating of, and not at all of his
   kingdom as mediator. 2. It expressly answers the "worlds" that he is
   said to make, verse 2; which are not "the things of the kingdom of
   Christ," nor do our catechists plead them directly so to be. This term,
   "all things," is never put absolutely for all the things of the kingdom
   of Christ. 3. The subject-matter here treated of by the apostle is the
   person of Jesus Christ and the eminency thereof. The medium whereby he
   proves it to be so excellent is his almighty power in creating and
   sustaining of all things. Nor is there any subject-matter intimated
   that should restrain these words to the things of the kingdom of
   Christ. 4. The word pheron, neither in its native signification nor in
   the use of it in the Scripture, gives any countenance to the
   interpretation of it by "governing or administering," nor can our
   catechists give any one instance of that signification there. It is
   properly "to bear, to carry, to sustain, to uphold." Out of nothing
   Christ made all things, and preserves them by his power from returning
   into nothing. 5. What insinuation of their sense they have from that
   expression," By the word of his power," I know not. "By the word of his
   power" is "By his powerful word." And that that word or command is
   sometimes taken for the effectual strength and efficacy of God's
   dominion, put forth for the accomplishing of his own purposes, I
   suppose needs not much proving.

   Grotius would have the words dunamis hautou to refer to the power of
   the Father, "Christ upholdeth all things by the word of his Father's
   power," without reason or proof, nor will the grammatical account bear
   that reddition of the relative mentioned.

   About that which they urge out of Jude 5 I shall not contend. The
   testimony from thence relies on the authority of the Vulgar Latin
   translation; which, as to me, may plead for itself.

   Neither of what is mentioned from 1 Cor. x. shall I insist on any
   thing, but only the 9th verse, the words whereof are, "Neither let us
   tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of
   serpents." The design of the apostle is known. From the example of
   God's dealing with the children of Israel in the wilderness upon their
   sins and provocations, there being a parity of state and condition
   between them and Christians as to their spiritual participation of
   Jesus Christ, verses 1-4, he dehorts believers from the ways and sins
   whereby God was provoked against them. Particularly in this verse he
   insists on the tempting of Christ; for which the Lord sent fiery
   serpents among them, by which they were destroyed, Num. xxi. 6. He whom
   the people tempted in the wilderness, and for which they were destroyed
   by serpents, was the Lord Jehovah; now, this doth the apostle apply to
   Christ: he therefore is the Lord Jehovah. But they say, --

   From those words it cannot be proved that Christ was really tempted in
   the wilderness, as from the like speech, if any one should so speak,
   may be apprehended. "Be not refractory to the magistrates, as some of
   our ancestors were." You would not thence conclude straightway that the
   same singular magistrates were in both places intended. And if the like
   phrases of speech are found in Scripture, in which the like expression
   is referred to him whose name was expressed a little before, without
   any repetition of the same name, it is there done where another besides
   him who is expressed cannot be understood; as you have an example of
   here, Deut. vi. 16, "You shall not tempt the Lord your God, as you
   tempted him in Massah." But in this speech of the apostle of which we
   treat, another besides Christ may be understood, as Moses or Aaron; of
   which see Num. xxi. 5. [341]

   1. Is there the same reason of these two expressions, "Do not tempt
   Christ, as some of them tempted," and, "Be not refractory against the
   magistrates, as some of them were"? "Christ" is the name of one
   singular individual person, wherein none shareth at any time, it being
   proper only to him. "Magistrate" is a term of office, as it was to him
   that went before him, and will be to him that shall follow after him.

   2. They need not to have puzzled their catechumens with their long
   rule, which I shall as little need to examine, for none can be
   understood here but Christ. That the word "God" should be here
   understood they do not plead, nor if they had had a mind thereunto is
   there any place for that plea; for if the apostle had intended God in
   distinction from Christ, it was of absolute necessity that he should
   have expressed it; nor, if it had been expressed, would the apostle's
   argument have been of any force unless Christ had been God, equal to
   him who was so tempted.

   3. It is false that the Israelites tempted Moses or Aaron, or that it
   can be said they tempted them. It is God they are everywhere said to
   tempt, Ps. lxxviii. 18, 56; Ps. cvi. 14; Heb. iii. 9. It is said,
   indeed, "that they murmured against Moses, that they provoked him, that
   they chode with him;" but to tempt him, -- which is to require a sign
   and manifestation of his divine power, -- that they did not, nor could
   be said to do, Num. xxi. 5.

   Grotius tries his last shift in this place, and tells us, from I know
   not what ancient manuscript, that it is not, "Let us not tempt Christ,"
   but, "Let us not tempt God:" "Error commissus ex notis Thn. et Chn."
   That neither the Syriac, nor the Vulgar Latin translation, nor any copy
   that either Stephanus in his edition of the New Testament or in his
   various lections had seen, nor any of Beza's, nor Erasmus' (who would
   have been ready enough to have laid hold of the advantage), should in
   the least give occasion of any such conjecture of an alteration, doth
   wholly take off, with me, all the authority either of the manuscript or
   of him that affirms it from thence. [342]

   As they please to proceed, the next place to be considered is John xii.
   41, "These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
   him."

   The words in the foregoing verses, repeated by the apostle, manifest
   that it is the vision mentioned Isa. vi. that the apostle relates unto.
   Whence we thus argue: He whose glory Isaiah saw, chap. vi., was "the
   Holy, holy, Lord of hosts," verse 3, "the King, the Lord of hosts,"
   verse 5; but this was Jesus Christ whose glory Isaiah then saw, as the
   Holy Ghost witnesses in these words of John xii. 41. What say our
   catechists?

   First, it appears that these words are not necessarily referred to
   Christ, because they may be understood of God the Father; for the words
   a little before are spoken of him, "He hath blinded, hardened, healed."
   Then, the glory that Isaiah saw might be, nay was, not present, but
   future; for it is proper to prophets to see things future, whence they
   are called "seers," 1 Sam. ix. 9. Lastly, although these words should
   be understood of that glory which was then present and seen to Isaiah,
   yet to see the glory of one and to see himself are far different
   things. And in the glory of that one God Isaiah saw also the glory of
   the Lord Christ; for the prophet says there, "The whole earth is full
   of the glory of God," verse 3. But then this was accomplished in
   reality when Jesus appeared to that people, and was afterward preached
   to the whole world. [343]

   It is most evident that these men know not what to say nor what to
   stick to in their interpretation of this place. This makes them heap up
   so many several suggestions, contradictory one to another, crying that
   "It may be thus," or "It may be thus." But, -- 1. That these words
   cannot be referred to God the Father, but must of necessity be referred
   to Christ, is evident, because there is no occasion of mentioning him
   in this place, but an account is given of what was spoken verse 37,
   "But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed
   not on him;" to which answers this verse, "When he saw his glory, and
   spake of him." The other words of "blinding" and "hardening" are
   evidently alleged to give an account of the reason of the Jews'
   obstinacy in their unbelief, not relating immediately to the person
   spoken of. The subject-matter treated of is Christ. The occasion of
   mentioning this testimony is Christ. Of him here are the words spoken.
   2. The glory Isaiah saw was present; all the circumstances of the
   vision evince no less. He tells you the time, place, and circumstances
   of it; -- when he saw the seraphims; when he heard their voice; when
   the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried; when the
   house was filled with glory; and when he himself was so terrified that
   he cried out, "Woe is me, for I am undone!" If any thing in the world
   be certain, it is certain that he saw that glory present. 3. He did not
   only see his glory, but he saw him; or he so saw his glory as that he
   saw him, so as he may be seen. So the prophet says expressly, "I have
   seen the King, the Lord of hosts." And what the prophet says of seeing
   the Lord of hosts, the apostle expresses by seeing "his glory;" because
   he saw him in that glorious vision, or saw that glorious representation
   of his presence. 4. He did, indeed, see the glory of the Lord Christ in
   seeing the glory of the one God, he being the true God of Israel; and
   on no other account is his glory seen than by seeing the glory of the
   one true God. 5. The prophet doth not say that "the earth was full of
   the glory of God," but it is the proclamation that the seraphims made
   one to another concerning that God whose presence was then there
   manifested. 6. When Christ first appeared to the people of the Jews,
   there was no great manifestation of glory. The earth was always full of
   the glory of God. And if those words have any peculiar relation to the
   glory of the gospel, yet withal they prove that he was then present
   whose glory in the gospel was afterward to fill the earth.

   Grotius hath not aught to add to what was before insisted on by his
   friends. A representation he would have this to be of God's dealing in
   the gospel, when it is plainly his proceeding in the rejection of the
   Jews for their incredulity, and tells you, "Dicitur Esaias vidisse
   gloriam Christi, sicut Abrahamus diem ejus;" -- "Isaiah saw his glory,
   as Abraham saw his day." Well aimed, however! Abraham saw his day by
   faith; Isaiah saw his glory in a vision. Abraham saw his day as future,
   and rejoiced; Isaiah so saw his glory as God present that he trembled.
   Abraham saw the day of Christ all the days of his believing; Isaiah saw
   his glory only in the year that king Uzziah died. Abraham saw the day
   of Christ in the promise of his coming; Isaiah saw his glory with the
   circumstances before mentioned. Even such let all undertakings appear
   to be that are against the eternal deity of Jesus Christ!

   In his annotations on the 6th of Isaiah, where the vision insisted on
   is expressed, he takes no notice at all of Jesus Christ or the second
   person of the Trinity; nor (which is very strange) doth he so much as
   once intimate that what is here spoken is applied by the Holy Ghost
   unto Christ in the gospel, nor once name the chapter where it is done!
   With what mind and intention the business is thus carried on God knows;
   I know not.

Chapter XIII.

   Of the incarnation of Christ, and his pre-existence thereunto.

   The testimonies of Scripture which affirm Christ to have been
   incarnate, or to have taken flesh, which inevitably proves his
   pre-existence in another nature to his so doing, they labour, in their
   next attempt, to corrupt, and so to evade the force and efficacy which
   from them appeareth so destructive to their cause; and herein they thus
   proceed:--

   Ques. From what testimonies of Scripture do they endeavour to
   demonstrate that Christ was, as they speak, incarnate?

   Ans. From these, John i. 14; Phil. ii. 6, 7; 1 Tim. iii. 16; Heb. ii.
   16, i.John iv. 2, 3; Heb. x. 5. [344]

   Of the first of these we have dealt already, in the handling of the
   beginning of that chapter, and sufficiently vindicated it from all
   their exceptions; so that we may proceed immediately to the second.

   Q. What dost thou answer to the second?

   A. Neither is that here contained which the adverse party would prove:
   for it is one thing which the apostle saith, "Being in the form of God,
   he took the form of a servant;" another, that the divine nature assumed
   the human; for the "form of God" cannot here denote the divine nature,
   seeing the apostle writes that Christ exinanivit, -- made that form of
   no reputation, but God can no way make his nature of no reputation;
   neither doth the "form of a servant" denote human nature, seeing to be
   a servant is referred to the fortune and condition of a man. Neither is
   that also to be forgotten, that the writings of the New Testament do
   once only, it may be, use that word "form" elsewhere, namely, Mark xvi.
   12, and that in that sense wherein it signifies not nature, but the
   outward appearance, saying, "Jesus appeared in another form unto two of
   his disciples."

   Q. But from those words which the apostle afterward adds, "He was found
   in fashion as a man," doth it not appear that he was, as they say,
   incarnate?

   A. By no means; for that expression contains nothing of Christ's
   nature: for of Samson we read that he should be "as a man," Judges xvi.
   7, 11; and, Ps. lxxxii., Asaph denounced to those whom he called "sons
   of the Most High," that they "should die like men;" -- of whom it is
   certain that it cannot be said of them that they were, as they speak,
   incarnate.

   Q. How dost thou understand this place?

   A. On this manner, that Christ, who in the world did the works of God,
   to whom all yielded obedience as to God, and to whom divine adoration
   was given, -- God so willing, and the salvation of men requiring it, --
   was made as a servant and a vassal, and as one of the vulgar, when he
   had of his own accord permitted himself to be taken, bound, beaten, and
   slain. [345]

   Thus they. Now, because it is most certain and evident to every one
   that ever considered this text, that, according to their old trade and
   craft, they have mangled it and taken it in pieces, at least cut off
   the head and legs of this witness, we must seek out the other parts of
   it and lay them together before we may proceed to remove this heap out
   of our way. Our argument from this place is not solely from hence, that
   he is said to be "in the form of God," but also that he was so in the
   form of God as to be "equal with him," as is here expressed; nor merely
   that "he took upon him the form of a servant," but that he took it upon
   him when he was "made in the likeness of men," or "in the likeness of
   sinful flesh," as the apostle expresses it, Rom. viii. 3. Now, these
   things our catechists thought good to take no notice of in this place,
   nor of one of them any more in any other. But seeing the very head of
   our argument lies in this, that "in the form of God" he is said to be
   "equal with God," and that expression is in another place taken notice
   of by them, I must needs gather it into its own contexture before I do
   proceed. Thus, then, they:--

   Q. How dost thou answer to those places where Christ is said to be
   equal to God, John v. 18, Phil. ii. 6?

   A. That Christ is equal to God doth no way prove that there is in him a
   divine nature. Yea, the contrary is gathered from hence; for if Christ
   be equal to God, who is God by nature, it follows that he cannot be the
   same God. But the equality of Christ with God lies herein, that, by
   that virtue that God bestowed on him, he did and doth all those things
   which are God's, as God himself. [346]

   This being the whole of what they tender to extricate themselves from
   the chains which this witness casts upon them, now lying before us, I
   shall propose our argument from the words, and proceed to the
   vindication of it in order.

   The intendment and design of the apostle in this place being evidently
   to exhort believers to self-denial, mutual love, and condescension one
   to another, he proposes to them the example of Jesus Christ; and lets
   them know that he, being in the form of God, and equal with God"
   therein (huparchon, existing in that form, having both the nature and
   glory of God), did yet, in his love to us, "make himself of no
   reputation," or lay aside and eclipse his glory, in this, that "he took
   upon him the form of a servant," being made man, that in that form and
   nature he might be "obedient unto death" for us and in our behalf.
   Hence we thus plead:--

   He that was "in the form of God," and "equal with God," existing
   therein, and "took on him the" nature and "form of a servant," he is
   God by nature, and was incarnate or made flesh in the sense before
   spoken of; now all this is affirmed of Jesus Christ: ergo.

   1. To this they say (that we may consider that first which is first in
   the text), "That his being equal to God doth not prove him to be God by
   nature, but the contrary," etc., as above. But, -- (1.) If none is, nor
   can be, by the testimony of God himself, like God, or equal to him, who
   is not God by nature, then he that is equal to him is so. But, "To whom
   will ye liken me? or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your
   eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things," Isa. xl. 25,
   26. None that hath not created all things of nothing can be equal to
   him. And, "To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me,
   that we may be like?" chap. xlvi. 5. (2.) Between that which is finite
   and that which is infinite, that which is eternal and that which is
   temporal, the creature and the Creator, God by nature and him who by
   nature is not God, it is utterly impossible there should be any
   equality. (3.) God having so often avouched his infinite distance from
   all creatures, his refusal to give his glory to any of them, his
   inequality with them all, it must have been the highest robbery that
   ever any could be guilty of, for Christ to make himself equal to God if
   he were not God. (4.) The apostle's argument arises from hence, that he
   was equal to God before he took on him the form of a servant; which was
   before his working of those mighty works wherein these gentlemen assert
   him to be equal to God.

   2. Themselves cannot but know the ridiculousness of their begging the
   thing in question, when they would argue that because he was equal to
   God he was not God. He was the same God in nature and essence, and
   therein equal to him to whom he was in subordination as the Son, and in
   office a servant, as undertaking the work of mediation.

   3. The case being as by them stated, there was no equality between
   Christ and God in the works he wrought; for, -- (1.) God doth the works
   in his own name and authority, Christ in God's. (2.) God doth them by
   his own power, Christ by God's. (3.) God doth them himself, Christ not,
   but God in him, as another from him. (4.) He doth not do them as God,
   however that expression be taken; for, according to these men, he
   wrought them neither in his own name, nor by his own power, nor for his
   own glory; all which he must do who doth things as God.

   He is said to be "equal with God," not as he did such and such works,
   but as en morphe Theou huarchon, -- being in the form of God
   antecedently to the taking in hand of that form wherein he wrought the
   works intimated.

   To work great works by the power of God argues no equality with him, or
   else all the prophets and apostles that wrought miracles were also
   equal to God. The infinite inequality of nature between the Creator and
   the most glorious creature will not allow that it be said, on any
   account, to be equal to him. Nor is it said that Christ was equal to
   God in respect of the works he did, but, absolutely, "He thought it not
   robbery to be equal with God."

   And so is their last plea to the first part of our argument accounted
   for: come we to what they begin withal.

   1. We contend not, as hath been often said, about words and
   expressions. (1.) That the divine nature assumed the human we thus far
   abide by, that the Word, the Son of God, took to himself, into personal
   subsistence with him, a human nature; whence they are both one person,
   one Christ. And this is here punctually affirmed, namely, he that was
   and is God took upon him the form of a man. (2.) The apostle doth not
   say that Christ made that form of no reputation, or Christ ekenose that
   form; but Christ, being in that form, heauton ekenose "made himself of
   no reputation," not by any real change of his divine nature, but by
   taking to himself the human, wherein he was of no reputation, it being
   he that was so, in the nature and by the dispensation wherein he was
   so. And it being not possible that the divine nature of itself, in
   itself, should be humbled, yet he was humbled who was in the form of
   God, though the form of God was not.

   2. It is from his being "equal with God," "in the form of God," whereby
   we prove that his being in the form of God doth denote his divine
   nature; but of this our catechists had no mind to take notice.

   3. The "form of a servant" is that which he took when he was made en
   homoiomati anthropon, as Adam begat a son in his own likeness. (1.)
   Now, this was not only in condition a servant, but in reality a man.
   (2.) The form of a servant was that wherein he underwent death, the
   death of the cross; but he died as a man, and not only in the
   appearance of a servant. (3.) The very phrase of expression manifests
   the human nature of Christ to be denoted hereby: only, as the apostle
   had not before said directly that he was God, but "in the form of God,"
   expressing both his nature and his glory, so here he doth not say he
   was a man, but in the "form of a servant," expressing both his nature
   and his condition, wherein he was the servant of the Father. Of him it
   is said en morphe Theou huparchon, but morphen doulou labon, -- he was
   in the other, but this he took. (4.) To be a servant denotes the state
   or condition of a man; but for one who was "in the form of God," and
   "equal with him," to be made in the "form of a servant," and to be
   "found as a man," and to be in that form put to death, denotes, in the
   first place, a taking of that nature wherein alone he could be a
   servant. And this answers also to other expressions, of the "Word being
   made flesh," and "God sending forth his Son, made of a woman." (5.)
   This is manifest from the expression, Schemati heuretheis hos
   anthropos, -- "He was found in fashion as a man;" that is, he was truly
   so: which is exegetical of what was spoken before, "He took on him the
   form of a servant."

   But they say, "This is of no importance, for the same is said of
   Samson, Judges xvi. 7, 11, and of others, Ps. lxxxii., who yet we do
   not say were incarnate."

   These gentlemen are still like themselves. Of Christ it is said that he
   humbled himself, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was found
   in likeness as a man; of Samson, that being stronger than a hundred
   men, if he were dealt so and so withal, he would "become as other men,"
   for so the words expressly are, -- no stronger than another man. And
   these places are parallel! Much good may these parallels do your
   catechumens! And so of those in the psalm, that though in this world
   they are high in power for a season, yet they should die as other men
   do. Hence, in a way of triumph and merriment, they ask if these were
   incarnate, and answer themselves that surely we will not say so. True,
   he who being as strong as many becomes by any means to be as one, and
   they who live in power but die in weakness as other men do, are not
   said to be incarnate; but he who, "being God, took on him the form of a
   servant, and was in this world a very man," may (by our new masters'
   leave) be said to be so.

   [As] for the sense which they give us of this place (for they are bold
   to venture at it), it hath been in part spoken to already. 1. Christ
   was in the world, as to outward appearance, no way instar Dei, but
   rather, as he says of himself, instar vermis. That he did the works of
   God, and was worshipped as God, was because he was God; nor could any
   but God either do the one, as he did them, or admit of the other. 2.
   This is the exposition given us: "?Christ was in the form of God,
   counting it no robbery to be equal to him;' that is, whilst he was here
   in the world, in the form of a servant, he did the works of God, and
   was worshipped." 3. Christ was in the form of a servant from his first
   coming into the world, and as one of the people; therefore he was not
   made so by any thing afterward. His being bound, and beat, and killed,
   is not his being made a servant; for that by the apostle is afterward
   expressed, when he tells us why, or for what end (not how or wherein),
   he was made a servant, namely, "He became obedient to death, the death
   of the cross."

   And this may suffice for the taking out of our way all that is excepted
   against this testimony by our catechists; but because the text is of
   great importance, and of itself sufficient to evince the sacred truth
   we plead for, some farther observations for the illustration of it may
   be added.

   The sense they intend to give us of these words is plainly this, "That
   Christ, by doing miracles in the world, appeared to be as God, or as a
   God; but he laid aside this form of God, and took upon him the form of
   a servant, when he suffered himself to be taken, bound, and crucified.
   He began to be," they say, "in the form of God, when, after his
   baptism, he undertook the work of his public ministry, and wrought
   mighty works in the world; which form he ceased to be in when he was
   taken in the garden, and exposed as a servant to all manner of
   reproach."

   That there is not any thing in this whole exposition answering the mind
   of the Holy Ghost is evident, as from what was said before, so also, 1.
   Because it is said of Christ, that en morphe Theou huparchon, he was
   "in the form of God," before he "took the form of a servant." And yet
   the taking of the form of a servant in this place doth evidently answer
   his being "made flesh," John i. 14; his being made "in the likeness of
   sinful flesh," Rom. viii. 3; his coming or being sent into the world,
   Matt. x. 40, xx. 28; John iii. 16, 17, etc. 2. Christ was still in the
   form of God, as taken essentially, even then when he was a servant;
   though, as to the dispensation he had submitted to, he emptied himself
   of the glory of it, and was not known to be the "Lord of glory," 2 Cor.
   viii. 9. 3. Even all the while that they say he was in the form of God,
   he was in the form of a servant; that is, he was really the servant of
   the Father, and was dealt withal in the world as a servant, under all
   manner of reproach, revilings, and persecutions. He was not more in the
   form of a servant when he was bound than when he had not where to lay
   his head. 4. The state and condition of a servant consists in this,
   that he is not sui juris. No more was Christ, in the whole course of
   his obedience; he did not any private will of his own, but the will of
   him that sent him. Those who desire to see the vindication of this
   place to the utmost, in all the particulars of it, may consult the
   confutation of the interpretation of Erasmus, by Beza, annot., in Phil.
   ii. 6, 7; of Ochinus and Lælius Socinus, by Zanchius in locum, et de
   Tribus Elohim, p. 227, etc.; of Faustus Socinus, by Beckman, Exercitat.
   p. 168, and Johan. Jun. Examen Respon. Socin. pp. 201, 202; of
   Enjedinus, by Gomarus, Anal. Epist. Paul. ad Phil. cap. ii.; of
   Ostorodius, by Jacobus a Porta, Fidei Orthodox. Defens. pp. 89, 150,
   etc. That which I shall farther add is in reference to Grotius, whose
   Annotations may be one day considered by some of more time and leisure
   for so necessary a work.

   Thus then he: Hos en morphe Theou huparchon. Morphe in nostris libris
   non significat internum et occultum aliquid, sed id quod in oculos
   incurrit, qualis erat eximia in Christo potestas sanandi morbos omnes,
   eichiendi dæmonas, excitandi mortuos, mutandi rerum naturas, quæ vere
   divina sunt; ita ut Moses, qui tam magna non fecit, dictus ob id fuerit
   dens Pharaonis. Vocem morphes quo dixi sensu habes, Matt. xvi. 12, Isa.
   xliv. 13, ubi in Hebræo tvnyt?; Dan. iv. 33, v. 6, 10, vii. 28, ubi in
   Chaldæo zyv?; Job iv. 16, ubi in Hebræo tmvnh?; -- Morphe in our books
   doth not signify an internal or hidden thing, but that which is visibly
   discerned, such as was that eminent power in Christ of healing all
   diseases, casting out of devils, raising the dead, changing the nature
   of things, which are truly divine; so that Moses, who did not so great
   things, was therefore called the god of Pharaoh. The word morphe, in
   the sense spoken of, you have Mark xvi. 12, Isa. xliv. 13, where in the
   Hebrew it is tvnyt?; Dan. iv. 33, etc., where in the Chaldee it is
   zyv?; Job iv. 16, where in the Hebrew it is tmvnh?.

   Ans. 1. A form is either substantial or accidental, -- that which is
   indeed, or that which appears. That it is the substantial form of God
   which is here intended, yet with respect to the glorious manifestation
   of it (which may be also as the accidental form), hath been formerly
   declared and proved. So far it signifies that which is internal and
   hidden, or not visibly discerned, inasmuch as the essence of God is
   invisible. The proofs of this I shall not now repeat. 2. Christ's power
   of working miracles was not visible, though the miracles he wrought
   were visible, insomuch that it was the great question between him and
   the Jews by what power he wrought his miracles; for they still pleaded
   that he cast out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. So that
   if the power of doing the things mentioned were morphe Theou, that form
   was not visible and exposed to the sight of men; for it was "aliquid
   internum et occultum," -- a thing internal and hidden. 3. If to be "in
   the form of God," and thereupon to be "equal with him," be to have
   power or authority of healing diseases, casting out devils, raising the
   dead, and the like, then the apostles were in the form of God, and
   equal to God, having Power and authority given them for all these
   things, which they wrought accordingly, casting out devils, healing the
   diseased, raising the dead, etc.; which whether it be not blasphemy to
   affirm the reader may judge. 4. It is true, God says of Moses, Exod.
   vii. 1, "I have made thee a god to Pharaoh;" which is expounded chap.
   iv. 16, where God tells him that "Aaron should be to him instead of a
   mouth, and he should be to him instead of God;" that is, Aaron should
   speak and deliver to Pharaoh and the people what God revealed to Moses,
   Moses revealing it to Aaron, -- Aaron receiving his message from Moses
   as other prophets did from God; whence he is said to be to him "instead
   of God." And this is given as the reason of that expression, chap. vii.
   1, of his being "a god to Pharaoh," even as our Saviour speaks, because
   the word of God came by him, because he should reveal the will of God
   to him: "Thou shalt be a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be
   thy prophet. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy
   brother shall speak unto Pharaoh." He is not upon the account of his
   working miracles called God, or said to be in the form of God, or to be
   made equal to God; hut revealing the will of God to Aaron, who spake it
   to Pharaoh, he is said to be "a god to Pharaoh," or "instead of God,"
   as to that business. 5. It is truth, the word morpe, or "form," is
   used, Mark xvi. 12, for the outward appearance; and it is as true the
   verb of the same signification is used for the internal and invisible
   form of a thing, Gal. iv. 19, Achris hou morphothe Cheistos en humin,
   "Until Christ be formed in you." So that the very first observation of
   our annotator, that "in our books" (that is, the Scriptures, for in
   other authors it is acknowledged that this word signifies the internal
   form of a thing) "this word morphe signifies not any thing internal or
   hidden," is true only of that one place, Mark xvi. 12. In this it is
   otherwise, and the verb of the same signification is evidently
   otherwise used. And, which may be added, other words that bear the same
   ambiguity of signification, as to things substantial or accidental,
   being applied to Christ, do still signify the former, not the latter,
   yea, where they expressly answer what is here spoken, as eikon, Col. i.
   15, and hupostasis, Heb. i. 3; both of the same import with morphe
   here, save that the latter adds personality. 6. As for the words
   mentioned out of the Old Testament, they are used in businesses quite
   of another nature, and are restrained in their signification by the
   matter they speak of. tvnyt? is not morphe properly, but eikon, and is
   translated "imago" by Arias Montanus. t'r? is rather morphe, Gen. xxix.
   17, 1 Sam. xxviii. 14. tmvnh? is used ten times in the Bible, and hath
   various significations, and is variously rendered: homoioma, Deut. iv.
   15; glupton homoioma, verse 16; so most commonly. zyv? in Daniel is
   "splendour," doxa, not morphe. And what all this is to the purpose in
   hand I know not. The "form of God," wherein Christ was, is that wherein
   he was "equal with God,' -- that which, as to the divine nature, is the
   same as his being in the "form of a servant," wherein he was obedient
   to death, was to the human. And, which is sufficiently destructive of
   this whole exposition, Christ was then in the "form of a servant," when
   this learned man would have him to be "in the form of God;" which two
   are opposed in this place, for he was the servant of the Father in the
   whole course of the work which he wrought here below, Isa. xlii. 1.

   He proceeds on this foundation: Ouk harpagmon hegesato to heinai ina
   Theo. "?Haarpagmon hegeisthai est locutio Syriaca In Liturgia Syriaca,
   Johannes Baptista Christo baptismum ab ipso expetenti, dicit, non
   assumam rapinam.' Solent qui aliquid bellica virtute peperere, id
   omnibus ostentare, ut Romani in triumpho facere solebant. Non multo
   aliter Plutarchus in Timoleonte: Ouch harpagen hegesato. Sensus est:
   Non venditavit Christus, non jactavit istam potestatem; quin sæpe etiam
   imperavit ne quod fecerat vulgaretur. Isa hic est adverbium; sic Odyss.
   O: Ton nun isa Theo, etc. Isothea phronein, dixit scriptor, 2 Macc ix.
   12. Einai ina Theo est spectari tanquam Deum." The sum of all is, "He
   thought it no robbery," that is, he boasted not of his power, "to be
   equal to God, so to be looked on as a God."

   The words, I confess, are not without their difficulty. Many
   interpretations are given of them; and I may say, that of the very many
   which I have considered, this of all others, as being wrested to
   countenance a false hypothesis, is the worst To insist particularly on
   the opening of the words is not my present task. That Grotius is beside
   the sense of them may be easily manifested; for, -- 1. He brings
   nothing to enforce this interpretation. That the expression is Syriac
   in the idiom of it he abides not by, giving us an instance of the same
   phrase or expression out of Plutarch, who knew the propriety of the
   Greek tongue very well, but of the Syriac not at all. Others also give
   a parallel expression out of Thucydides, lib. viii., Skeue harpagen
   poiesamenos. 2. I grant isa may be used adverbially, and be rendered
   "æqualiter;" but now the words are to be interpreted "pro subjecta
   materia." He who was in the form of God, and counted it no robbery
   (that is, did not esteem it to be any wrong, on that account of his
   being in the form of God) to be equal to his Father, did yet so submit
   himself as is described. This being "equal with God" is spoken of
   Christ accidentally to his "taking on him the form of a servant," which
   he did in his incarnation, and must relate to his being "in the form of
   God;" and if thereunto it be added that the intendment reaches to the
   declaration he made of himself, when he declared himself to be equal to
   God the Father, and one with him as to nature and essence, it may
   complete the sense of this place.

   All' heauton akenose he renders "libenter duxit vitam inopem,"
   referring it to the poverty of Christ whilst he conversed here in the
   world. But whatever be intended by this expression, 1. It is not the
   same with morphen doulou labon, which Grotius afterward interprets to
   the same purpose with what he says here of these words. 2. It must be
   something antecedent to his "taking the form of a servant;" or rather,
   something that he did, or became exceptively to what he was before, in
   becoming a servant. He was "in the form of God," all heauton ekenose,
   but "he humbled," or "bowed down himself," in "taking the form of a
   servant;" that is, he condescended thereunto, in his great love that he
   bare to us, the demonstration whereof the apostle insists expressly
   upon. And what greater demonstration of love, or condescension upon the
   account of love, could possibly be given, than for him who was God,
   equal to his Father, in the same Deity, to lay aside the manifestation
   of his glory, and to take upon him our nature, therein to be a servant
   unto death?

   He proceeds: Morphen doulou labon. "Similis factus servis, qui nihil
   proprium possident;" -- "He was made like unto servants, who possess
   nothing of their own." Our catechists, with their great master, refer
   this, his being like servants, to the usage he submitted to at his
   death; this man, to his poverty in his life. And to this sense of these
   words is that place of Matt. viii. 20 better accommodated than to the
   clause foregoing, for whose exposition it is produced by our annotator.

   But, -- 1. It is most certain that the exposition of Grotius will not,
   being laid together, be at any tolerable agreement with itself, if we
   allow any order of process to be in these words of the apostle. His aim
   is acknowledged to be an exhortation to brotherly love, and mutual
   condescension in the same, from the example of Jesus Christ; for he
   tells you that "he, being in the form of God, made himself of no
   reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant." Now, if this be
   not the gradation of the apostle, that being "in the form of God," free
   from any thing of that which follows, he then debased and humbled
   himself, and "took upon him the form of a servant," there is not any
   form of plea left from this example here proposed to the end aimed at.
   But now, says Grotius, "his being in the form of God was his working of
   miracles; his debasing himself, his being poor, his taking the form of
   a servant, possessing nothing of his own." But it is evident that there
   was a coincidence of time as to these things, and so no gradation in
   the words at all; for then when Christ wrought miracles, he was so poor
   and possessed nothing of his own, that there was no condescension nor
   relinquishment of one condition for another discernible therein. 2. The
   "form of a servant" that Christ took was that wherein he was like man,
   as it is expounded in the words next following: he was "made in the
   likeness of men." And what that is the same apostle informs us, Heb.
   ii. 17, Hothen opheile kata panta tois adelphois homoiothenai, --
   "Wherefore he ought in all things to be made like his brethren:" that
   is, en homoiomati anthropon genomenos, he was "made in the likeness of
   men;" or, as it is expressed Rom. viii. 3, en homoiomati sarkos, "in
   the likeness of flesh;" which also is expounded, Gal. iv. 4 genomenos
   ek gunaikos, "made of a woman;" -- which gives us the manner of the
   accomplishment of that, John i. 14, Ho Logos sarx egeneto, "The Word
   was made flesh." 3. The employment of Christ in that likeness of man is
   confessedly expressed in these words; not his condition, that he had
   nothing, but his employment, that he was the servant of the Father,
   according as it was foretold that he should be, Isa. xlii. 1, 19, and
   which he everywhere professed himself to be. He goes on, --

   En homoiomati anthropon genomenos. "Cum similis esset hominibus, illis
   nempe primis, id est, peccati expers," 2 Cor. v. 21; -- "Whereas he was
   like men, namely, those first; that is, without sin."

   That Christ was without sin, that in his being made like to us there is
   an exception as to sin, is readily granted. He was hosios akakos
   amiantos kechorismenos apo ton hamartolon, Heb. vii. 26. But, -- 1.
   That Christ is ever said to be made like Adam on that account, or is
   compared with him therein, cannot be proved. He was deueteros anthropos
   and eschatos Adam, but that he was made en homoiomati tou Adam is not
   said. 2. This expression was sufficiently cleared by the particular
   places formerly urged. It is not of his sinlessness in that condition,
   of which the apostle hath no occasion here to speak, but of his love in
   taking on him that condition, in being sent in the likeness of sinful
   flesh, yet without sin, that these words are used. It is a likeness of
   nature to all men, and not a likeness of innocency to the first, that
   the apostle speaks of; a likeness, wherein there is a tautotes, as to
   the kind, a distinction in number, as, "Adam begat a son in his own
   likeness," Gen. v. 3.

   All that follows in the learned annotator is only an endeavour to make
   the following words speak in some harmony and conformity to what he had
   before delivered; which being discerned not to be suited to the mind of
   the Holy Ghost in the place, I have no such delight to contend about
   words, phrases, and expressions, as to insist any farther upon them.
   Return we to our catechists.

   The place they next propose to themselves to deal withal is 1 Tim. iii.
   16, "And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was
   manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,
   revealed unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
   glory."

   If it be here evinced that by "God" is meant Christ, it being spoken
   absolutely, and in the place of the subject in the proposition, this
   business is at a present close, and our adversaries' following attempt
   to ward themselves from the following blows of the sword of the word,
   which cut them in pieces, is to no purpose, seeing their death's wound
   lies evident in the efficacy of this place. Now, here not only the
   common apprehension of all professors of the name of Christ in general,
   but also the common sense of mankind, to be tried in all that will but
   read the books of the New Testament, might righteously be appealed
   unto; but because these are things of no importance with them with whom
   we have to do, we must insist on other considerations:--

   First, then, That by the word Theos, "God," some person is intended, is
   evident from hence, that the word is never used but to express some
   person, nor can in any place of the Scriptures be possibly wrested to
   denote any thing but some person to whom that name doth belong or is
   ascribed, truly or falsely. And if this be not certain and to be
   granted, there is nothing so, nor do we know any thing in the world or
   the intendment of any one word in the book of God. Nor is there any
   reason pretended why it should have any other acceptation, but only an
   impotent begging of the thing in question "It is not so here, though it
   be so everywhere else; because it agrees not with our hypothesis."
   Leros! Secondly, That Christ, who is the second person [of the
   Trinity], the Son of God, is here intended, and none else, is evident
   from hence, that whatever is here spoken of Theos, of this "God," was
   true and fulfilled in him as to the matter; and the same expressions,
   for the most of the particulars, as to their substance, are used
   concerning him and no other; neither are they possible to be
   accommodated to any person but him. Let us a little accommodate the
   words to him: 1. He who as "God" was "in the beginning with God," in
   his own nature invisible, ephanerothe en sarki, "was manifested in the
   flesh," when sarx egeneto, when he was "made flesh," John i. 14, and
   made en homoiomati sarkos, Rom. viii. 3, "in the likeness of flesh,"
   genomenos ek spermatos Dabid kata sarka, chap. i. 3; so made "visible
   and conspicuous," or ephanerothe, when eskenosen en hemin, "dwelling
   among men; who also saw his glory, as the glory of the only-begotten of
   the Father," John i. 14. Being thus "manifest in the flesh," having
   taken our nature on him, he was reviled, persecuted, condemned, slain,
   by the Jews, as a malefactor, a seditious person, -- an impostor. But,
   2. Edikaiothe en Pseumati, he was "justified in the Spirit" from all
   their false accusations and imputations. He was justified by the
   eternal Spirit, when he was raised from the dead, and "declared to be
   the Son of God with power" thereby, Rom. i. 4; for though he was
   "crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God," 2 Cor.
   xiii. 4. So he also sent out his Spirit to "convince the world of sin,
   because they believed not on him, and of righteousness, because he went
   to his Father," John xvi. 8-10; which he also did, justifying himself
   thereby to the conviction and conversion of many thousands who before
   condemned him or consented to his condemnation, upon the account
   formerly mentioned, Acts ii. 47. And this is he who, 3. ophthe
   angelois, was "seen of angels," and so hath his witnesses in heaven and
   earth; for when he came first into the world, all the angels receiving
   charge to worship him, by Him who said, Proskunesatosan auto pantes
   angeloi autou, Heb. i. 6, one came down at his nativity to declare it,
   to whom he was seen, and instantly a multitude of the heavenly host saw
   him, Luke ii. 9-14, and afterward went away into heaven, verse 15. In
   the beginning also of his ministry, angels were sent to him in the
   wilderness, to minister to him, Matt. iv. 11; and when he was going to
   his agony in the garden, an angel was sent to comfort him, Luke xxii.
   43, and he then knew that he could at a word's speaking have more than
   twelve legions of angels to his assistance, Matt. xxvi. 53; and when he
   rose again the angels saw him again, and served him therein, chap.
   xxviii. 2. And as he shall come again with his holy angels to judgment,
   Matt. xxv. 31, 2 Thess. i. 7, so no doubt but in his ascension the
   angels accompanied him; yea, that they did so is evident from Ps.
   lxviii. 17, 18. So that there was no eminent concernment of him wherein
   it is not expressly affirmed that ophthe angelois. At his birth,
   entrance on his ministry, death, resurrection, ascension, ophthe
   angelois. 4. Ekeruchthe en ethnesin, He was "preached unto the
   Gentiles," or among the people or Gentiles; which, besides the
   following accomplishment of it to the full in the preaching of the
   gospel concerning him throughout the world, had a signal entrance in
   that declaration of him to "devout men dwelling at Jerusalem, out of
   every nation under heaven," Acts ii. 5. And hereupon, 5. Episteuthe en
   kosmo, He was "believed on in the world." He that had been rejected as
   a vile person, condemned and slain, being thus justified in the Spirit
   and preached, was believed on, many thousands being daily converted to
   the faith of him, -- to believe that he was the Messiah, the Son of
   God, -- whom before they received not, John i. 10, 11. And, for his own
   part, 6. anelephthe en doxe, he was "received up into glory;" the story
   whereof we have, Acts i. 9-11, "When he had spoken to his disciples, he
   was taken up, and a cloud received him:" of which Luke says briefly, as
   Paul here, anelephthe, Acts i. 2; as Mark also doth, chap. xvi. 19,
   anelephthe, -- that is, anelephthe en doxe, "he was taken up into
   heaven," or "to glory." Anelephthe is as much as ano elephthe, "he was
   taken up" (en phor eis) "into glory."

   This harmony of the description of Christ here, both as to his person
   and office, with what is elsewhere spoken of him (this being evidently
   a summary collection of what is more largely in the gospel spoken of),
   makes it evident that he is "God" here intended; which is all that is
   needful to be evinced from this place.

   Let us now hear our catechists pleading for themselves:--

   Q. What dost thou answer to 1 Tim. iii. 16?

   A. 1. That in many ancient copies, and in the Vulgar Latin itself, the
   word "God" is not read; wherefore from that place nothing certain can
   be concluded. 2. Although that word should be read, yet there is no
   cause why it should not be referred to the Father, seeing these things
   may be affirmed of the Father, that he appeared in Christ and the
   apostles, who were flesh. And for what is afterward read, according to
   the usual translation, "He was received into glory," in the Greek it
   is," He was received in glory," -- that is, "with glory," or
   "gloriously."

   Q. What, then, is the sense of this testimony?

   A. That the religion of Christ is full of mysteries: for God, -- that
   is, his will for the saving of men, -- was perfectly made known by
   infirm and mortal men; and yet, because of the miracles and various
   powerful works which were performed by such weak and mortal men, it was
   acknowledged for true; and it was at length perceived by the angels
   themselves; and was preached not only to the Jews but also to the
   Gentiles: all believed thereon, and it was received with great glory,
   after an eminent manner. [347]

   Thus they, merely rather than say nothing, or yield to the truth.
   Briefly to remove what they offer in way of exception or assertion, --

   1. Though the word "God," be not in the Vulgar Latin, [348] yet the
   unanimous, constant consent of all the original copies, confessed to be
   so both by Beza and Erasmus, is sufficient to evince that the loss of
   that translation is not of any import to weaken the sense of the place.
   Of other ancient copies, whereof they boast, they cannot instance one.
   In the Vulgar also it is evident that by the "mystery" Christ is
   understood.

   2. That what is here spoken may be referred to the Father, is a very
   sorry shift against the evidence of all those considerations which show
   that it ought to be referred to the Son.

   3. It may not, it cannot with any tolerable sense be, referred to the
   Father.

   It is not said that "in Christ and the apostles he appeared," and was
   "seen of angels," etc.; but that "God was manifested in the flesh,"
   etc.: nor is any thing that is here spoken of God anywhere ascribed, no
   not once in the Scripture, to the Father. How was he "manifested in the
   flesh"? how was he "justified in the Spirit"? how was "he taken up into
   glory"?

   4. Though en doxe may be rendered "gloriously, or "with glory," yet
   anelephthe may not, "receptus est," but rather "assumptus est," and is
   applied to the ascension of Christ in other places, as hath been
   showed.

   [As] for the sense they tender of these words, let them, -- 1. Give any
   one instance where "God" is put for the "will of God," and that
   exclusively to any person of the Deity, or, to speak to their own
   hypothesis, exclusively to the person of God. This is intolerable
   boldness, and argues something of searedness. 2. The "will of God for
   the salvation of men" is the gospel How are these things applicable to
   that? -- how was the gospel "justified in the Spirit"? how was it
   "received up into glory"? how was it "seen of angels, ophthe angelois?
   In what place is any thing of all this spoken of the gospel? Of Christ
   all this is spoken, as hath been said. In sum, "the will of God" is
   nowhere said to be "manifested in the flesh;" Christ was so. That "the
   will of God" should be "preached by weak and mortal men" was no "great
   mystery;" that God should assume human nature is so. The "will of God"
   cannot be said to "appear to the angels;" Christ did so. Of the last
   expression there can be no doubt raised.

   Grotius insists upon the same interpretation with our catechists, in
   the whole and in every part of it; nor doth he add any thing to what
   they plead but only some quotations of Scripture not at all to the
   purpose, or at best suited to his own apprehensions of the sense of the
   place, not opening it in the least, nor evincing what he embraces to be
   the mind of the Holy Ghost, to any one that is otherwise minded. What
   he says, because he says it, deserves to be considered.

   Theos ephanerothe en sarki. "Suspectam nobis hanc lectionem faciunt
   interpretes veteres, Latinus, Syrus, Arabs, et Ambrosius, qui omnes
   legunt, o ephanerothe." Addit Hincmarus Opusculo 55. illud Theos, "hic
   positum a Nestorianis." 1. But this suspicion might well have been
   removed from this learned man by the universal consent of all original
   copies, wherein, as it seems, his own manuscript, that sometimes helps
   him at a need, doth not differ. 2. One corruption in one translation
   makes many. 3. The Syriac reads the word "God," and so Tremellius hath
   rendered it; [349] Ambrose and Hincmarus followed the Latin
   translation; and there is a thousand times more probability that the
   word Theos was filched out by the Arians than that it was foisted in by
   the Nestorians. But if the agreement of all original copies may be thus
   contemned, we shall have nothing certain left us. But, saith he,
   "Sensum bonum facit illud, o ephanerothe. Evangelium illud coeleste
   innotuit primum non per angelos, sed per homines mortales, et quantum
   extera species ferebat infirmos, Christum, et apostolos ejus
   Ephanerothe, ... bene convenit mysterio, id est, rei latenti. Sic et
   Col. i. 26; sarx hominem significat mortalem, 2 Cor. v. 16. Vide 1 John
   iv. 2, et quæ ad eum locum dicentur."

   1. Our annotator, having only a suspicion that the word Theos was not
   in the text, ought, on all accounts, to have interpreted the words
   according to the reading whereof he had the better persuasion, and not
   according unto that whereof he had only a suspicion. But then it was by
   no means easy to accommodate them according to his intention, nor to
   exclude the person of Christ from being mentioned in them; which, by
   joining in with his suspicion, he thought himself able to do. 2. He is
   not able to give us any one instance in the Scripture of the like
   expression to this, of "manifest in the flesh," being referred to the
   gospel. When referred to Christ, nothing is more frequent, John i. 14,
   vi. 53; Acts ii. 31; Rom. i. 3, viii. 3, ix. 5; Eph. ii. 14, 15; Col.
   i. 22; Heb. v. 7, x. 19, 20; 1 Pet. iii. 18, iv. 1, 1 John iv. 2, etc.
   Of the "flesh of the gospel," not one word. 3. There is not the least
   opposition intimated between men and angels as to the means of
   preaching the gospel; nor is this any mystery, that the gospel was
   preached by men. Ephanerothe is well applied to a "mystery" or "hidden
   thing;" but the question is, what the "mystery" or "hidden thing" is.
   We say it was the great matter of the Word's being made flesh, as it is
   elsewhere expressed. In the place urged out of the Corinthians, whether
   it be the 5th or 11th chapter that is intended, there is nothing to
   prove that sarx signifies a mortal man. And this is the entrance of
   this exposition. Let us proceed.

   Edikaiothe en Peumati. "Per plurima miracula approbata est ea veritas.
   Pneuma sunt miracula divina, per metonumian quæ est, 1 Cor. ii. 4, et
   alibi." "?Justified in the Spirit;" that is, approved by many miracles,
   for Pneuma is miracles by a metonymy." Then let every thing be as the
   learned man will have it. It is in vain to contend; for surely never
   was expression so wrested. That Pneuma simply is "miracles" is false;
   that to have a thing done en Pneumati signifies "miracles" is more
   evidently so, 1 Cor. ii. 4. The apostle speaks not at all of miracles,
   but of the efficacy of the Spirit with him in his preaching the word,
   to "convince the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment," according
   to the promise of Christ. For the application of this expression to
   Jesus Christ see above. He adds, dikaiousthai is here "approbare," ut
   Matt. xi. 19. It is here to "approve;" and that because it was
   necessary that the learned annotator should douleuein hupothesei. In
   what sense the word is taken, and how applied to Christ, with the
   genuine meaning of the place, see above. See also John i. 33, 34. Nor
   is the gospel anywhere said to be "justified in the Spirit;" nor is
   this a tolerable exposition, "?Justified in the Spirit,' -- that is, it
   was approved by miracles."

   Ophthe angelois. "Nempe cum admiratione maxima. Angeli hoc arcanum per
   homines mortales didicere, Eph. iii. 10; 1 Pet. i. 12." How eminently
   this suits what is spoken of Jesus Christ was showed before. It is
   true, the angels, as with admiration, look into the things of the
   gospel; but that it is said the gospel ophthe angelois is not proved.

   It is true, the gospel was preached to the Gentiles; but yet this word
   is most frequently applied to Christ. Acts iii. 20, viii. 5, 25, ix.
   20, xix. 13; 1 Cor. i. 23, xv. 12; 2 Cor. i. 19, 2 Cor. iv. 5, xi. 4;
   Phil. i. 15, are testimonies hereof.

   Episteuthe en kosmo. "Id est, in magna mundi parte, Rom. i. 8, Col. i.
   6." But then, I pray, what difference is between edikaiothe en Pneumati
   and episteuthe en kosmo? The first is, "It was approved by miracles;"
   the other, "It was believed." Now, to approve the truth of the gospel,
   taken actively, is to believe it. How much more naturally this is
   accommodated to Christ, see John iii. 17, 18, and verses 35, 36, vi.
   40; Acts x. 43, xvi. 31; Rom. iii. 22, x. 8, 9; Gal. ii. 16, 1 John v.
   5, etc.

   The last clause is, anelephthe en doxe. "Gloriose admodum exaltatum
   est, nempe quia multo majorem attulit sanctitatem, quam ulla antehac
   dogmata." And this must be the sense of the word analambanomai in this
   business: see Luke ix. 51; Mark xvi. 19; Acts i. 2, 11, 22. And in this
   sense we are indifferent whether en doxe be eis doxan, "unto glory,"
   which seems to be most properly intended; or sun doxe, "with glory," as
   our adversaries would have it; or "gloriously," as Grotius: for it was
   gloriously, with great glory, and into that glory which he had with his
   Father before the world was. That the gospel is glorious in its
   doctrine of holiness is true, but not at all spoken of in this place.

   Heb. ii. 16 is another testimony insisted on to prove the incarnation
   of Christ; and so, consequently, his subsistence in a divine nature
   antecedently thereunto. The words are, "For verily he took not on him
   the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham." To this
   they answer, that --

   Herein not so much as any likeness of the incarnation, as they call it,
   doth appear; for this writer doth not say that "Christ took" (as some
   read it, and commonly they take it in that sense), but "he takes." Nor
   doth he say" human nature," but the "seed of Abraham;" which in the
   holy Scriptures denotes them who believe in Christ, as Gal. iii. 29.

   Q. What then is the sense of this place?

   A. This is that which this writer intends, that Christ is not the
   Saviour of angels, but of men believing; who, because they are subject
   to afflictions and death (which he before expressed by the
   participation of flesh and blood), therefore did Christ willingly
   submit himself unto them, that he might deliver his faithful ones from
   the fear of death, and might help them in all their afflictions. [350]

   The sense of this place is evident, the objections against it weak. 1.
   That the word is epilambanetai, not epelabeto, "assumit," not
   "assumpsit," is an enallage of tense so usual as that it can have no
   force as an objection; and, verse 14, it is twice used in a contrary
   sense, the time past being put for the present, as here the present for
   that which is past, kekoinoneke for koinonei, and metesche for
   metechei. See John iii. 31, xxi. 13. 2. That by the "seed of Abraham"
   is here intended the human nature of the seed of Abraham, appears, --
   (1.) From the expression going before, of the same import with this,
   "He took part of flesh and blood," verse 14. (2.) From the opposition
   here made to angels or the angelical nature; the Holy Ghost showing
   that the business of Christ being to save his church by dying for them,
   he was not therefore to take upon him an angelical, spiritual substance
   or nature, but the nature of man. 3. The same thing is elsewhere in
   like manner expressed, as where he is said to be "made of the seed of
   David according to the flesh," Rom. i. 3, and to "come of the fathers
   as concerning the flesh," chap. ix. 5. 4. Believers are called
   Abraham's seed sometimes spiritually, in relation to the faith of
   Abraham, as Gal. iii. 29, where he is expressly spoken of as father of
   the faithful by inheriting the promises; but take it absolutely, to be
   of the "seed of Abraham" is no more but to be a man of his posterity:
   John viii. 37, "I know that ye are Abraham's seed." Rom. ix. 7,
   "Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children."
   Verse 8, "That is, They are the children of the flesh." So Rom. xi. 1.
   "Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I," 2 Cor. xi. 22.

   [As] for the sense assigned, -- 1. It is evident that in these words
   the apostle treats not of the help given, but of the way whereby Christ
   came to help his church, and the means thereof; his actual helping and
   relieving of them is mentioned in the next verse. 2. Here is no mention
   in this verse of believers being obnoxious to afflictions and death; so
   that these words of theirs may serve for an exposition of some other
   place of Scripture (as they say of Gregory's comment on Job), but not
   of this. 3. By "partaking of flesh and blood" is not meant, primarily,
   being obnoxious to afflictions and death, nor doth that expression in
   any place signify any such thing, though such a nature as is so
   obnoxious be intended.

   The argument, then, from hence stands still in its force, that Christ,
   subsisting in his divine nature, did assume a human nature of the seed
   of Abraham into personal union with himself.

   Grotius is still at a perfect agreement with our catechists. Saith he,
   "?Epilambanesthai apud Platenem et alios est solenniter vindicare; hic
   autem ex superioribus intelligendum est, vindicare, seu asserere in
   libertatem manu injecta;" -- "This word in Plato and others is to
   vindicate into liberty; here, as is to be understood from what went
   before, it is to assert into liberty by laying hold with the hand." Of
   the first, because he gives no instances, we shall need take no farther
   notice. The second is denied. Both the help afforded and the means of
   it by Christ are mentioned before. The help is liberty; the means,
   partaking of flesh and blood, to die. These words are not expressive of
   nor do answer the latter, or the help afforded, but the means of the
   obtaining of it, as hath been declared. But he adds, "The word
   signifies to lay hold of with the hand, as Mark viii. 23," etc. Be it
   granted that it doth so. "To lay hold with the hand, and to take to
   one's self," this is not to assert into liberty, but by the help of a
   metaphor; and when the word is used metaphorically, it is to be
   interpreted "pro subjecta materia," according to the subject-matter,
   which here is Christ's taking a nature upon him that was of Abraham,
   that was not angelical. The other expression he is singular in the
   interpretation of.

   "He took the seed of Abraham." "Id est, Id agit ut vos Hebroæos liberet
   a peccatis et metu mortis. Eventûs enim nomen sæpe datur operæ in id
   impensæ;" -- "That is, He doth that that he may deliver you Hebrews
   from sin and fear of death.' The name of the event is often given to
   the work employed to that purpose." But, -- 1. Here, I confess, he
   takes another way from our catechists. The "seed of Abraham" is with
   them believers; with him only Jews. But the tails of their discourse
   are tied together with a firebrand between them, to devour the harvest
   of the church. 2. This taking the seed of Abraham is opposed to his not
   taking the seed of angels. Now the Jews are not universally opposed to
   angels in this thing, but human kind. 3. He "took the seed of Abraham"
   is, it seems, he endeavoured to help the Jews. The whole discourse of
   the help afforded, both before and after this verse, is extended to the
   whole church; how comes it here to be restrained to the Jews only? 4.
   The discourse of the apostle is about the undertaking of Christ by
   death, and his being fitted thereunto by partaking of flesh and blood;
   which is so far from being in any place restrained or accommodated only
   to the Jews, as that the contrary is everywhere asserted, is known to
   all.

   [The next place is] 1 John iv. 2, "Every spirit that confesseth that
   Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God." He who comes into the
   world, or comes into flesh or in the flesh, had a subsistence before he
   so came. It is very probable that the intendment of the apostle was to
   discover the abomination of them who denied Christ to be a true man,
   but assigned him a fantastical body; which yet he so doth as to express
   his coming in the flesh in such a manner as evidences him to have
   another nature (as was said) besides that which is here synecdochically
   called "flesh." Our catechists to this say, --

   That this is not to the purpose in hand; for that which some read, "He
   came into the flesh," is not in the Greek, but "He came in the flesh."
   Moreover, John doth not write, "That spirit which confesseth Jesus
   Christ, which came in the flesh, is of God;" but that "That spirit
   which confesseth Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh, is of God."
   The sense of which words is, that the spirit is of God which confesseth
   that Jesus Christ, who performed his office in the earth without any
   pomp or worldly ostentation, with great humility as to outward
   appearance, and great contempt, and lastly underwent a contumelious
   death, is Christ, and King of the people of God. [351]

   I shall not contend with them about the translation of the words. 1. En
   sarki seems to be put for eis sarka, but the intendment is the same;
   for the word "came" is eleluthota, that is, "that came," or "did come."
   2. It is not ton eleluthota, "who did come," that thence any colour
   should be taken for the exposition given by them, of confessing that
   Christ, or him who is the Christ, is the King of the people of God, or
   confessing him to be the Christ, the King of the people of God; but it
   is, "that confesseth him who came in the flesh," that is, as to his
   whole person and office, his coming, and what he came for. 3. They
   cannot give us any example nor any one reason to evince that that
   should be the meaning of en sarki which here they pretend. The meaning
   of it hath above been abundantly declared, so that there is no need
   that we should insist longer on this place, nor why we should trouble
   ourselves with Grotius' long discourse on this place. The whole
   foundation of it is, that "to come in the flesh" signifies to come in a
   low, abject condition, -- a pretence without proof, without evidence.
   "Flesh" may sometimes be taken so; but that to "come in the flesh" is
   to come in such a condition, we have not the least plea pretended.

   The last place they mention to this purpose is Heb. x. 5, "Wherefore,
   when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou
   wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me." He who had a body
   prepared for him when he came into the world, he subsisted in another
   nature before that coming of his into the world. To this they say, --

   Neither is there here any mention made of the incarnation (as they call
   it), seeing that world, into which the author says Christ entered, is
   the world to come, as was above demonstrated; whence to come into the
   world doth not signify to be born into the world, but to enter into
   heaven. Lastly, in these words, "A body hast thou prepared me," that
   word, "a body" (as appeared from what was said where his entering this
   world was treated of), may be taken for an immortal body.

   Q. What is the sense of this place?

   A. That God fitted for Jesus such a body, after he entered heaven, as
   is fit and accommodate for the discharging of the duty of a high
   priest. [352]

   But, doubtless, than this whole dream nothing can be more fond or
   absurd. 1. How many times is it said that Christ came into this world,
   where no other world but this can be understood! "For this cause,"
   saith he, "came I into the world, that I might bear witness unto the
   truth," John xviii. 37. Was it into heaven that Christ came to bear
   witness to the truth? "Jesus Christ came into the world to save
   sinners," 1 Tim. i. 15. Was it into heaven? 2. These words, "A body
   hast thou prepared me," are a full expression of what is
   synecdochically spoken of in the Psalms in these words, "Mine ears hast
   thou opened," expressing the end also why Christ had a body prepared
   him, -- namely, that he might yield obedience to God therein; which he
   did signally in this world when he was "obedient unto death, the death
   of the cross." 3. As I have before manifested the groundlessness of
   interpreting the word "world," put absolutely, of the "world to come,"
   and so taken off all that here they relate unto, so in that
   demonstration which, God assisting, I shall give of Christ's being a
   priest and offering sacrifice in this world before he entered into
   heaven, I shall remove what farther here they pretend unto. In the
   meantime, such expositions as this, that have no light nor colour given
   them from the texts they pretend to unfold, had need of good strength
   of analogy given them from elsewhere; which here is not pretended.
   "?When he cometh into the world,' that is, when he enters heaven, he
   says, A body hast thou prepared me,' that is, an immortal body thou
   hast given me." And that by this immortal body they intend indeed no
   body I shall afterward declare.

   Grotius turns these words quite another way, not agreeing with our
   catechists, yet doing still the same work with them; which, because he
   gives no proof of his exposition, it shall suffice so to have
   intimated. In sum, verse 4, he tells us how the blood of Christ takes
   away sin, namely, "Because it begets faith in us, and gives right to
   Christ for the obtaining of all necessary helps for us," in pursuit of
   his former interpretation of chapter ix., where he wholly excludes the
   satisfaction of Christ. His coming into the world is, he says, "His
   showing himself to the world, after he had led a private life therein
   for a while," contrary to the perpetual use of that expression of the
   New Testament. And so the whole design of the place is eluded, the
   exposition whereof I shall defer to the place of the satisfaction of
   Christ.

   And these are the texts of Scripture our catechists thought good to
   endeavour a delivery of themselves from, as to that head or argument of
   our plea for his subsistence in a divine nature antecedently to his
   being born of the Virgin, -- namely, because he is said to be incarnate
   or "made flesh."

   loquuntur) incarnatum esse? -- Ex iis ubi secundum eorum versionem
   legitur, Verbum caro factum est, Johan. i. 14; Et qui (Christus) cum
   esset in forma Dei, etc.; Phil. ii. 6, 7; 1 Tim. iii. 16; Heb. ii. 16,
   i.; 1 Johan. iv. 2, 3; Heb. x. 5."

   pars confectum velit. Aliud enim est quod hic apostolus ait, Cum in
   forma Dei esset, forman servi assumpsit; aliud vero natura divina
   assumpsit humanam. Etenim hic forma Dei designare non potest Dei
   naturam, cum apostolus scribat eam formam Christum exinanivisse. Deus
   vero naturam suam nullo mode exinanire potest; nec vero forma servi
   denotat naturam humanam, cum servum esse ad fortunam et conditionem
   hominis referatur. At ne id quoque dissimulandum est, scripta Novi
   Testamenuti hanc vocem forma semel fortassis tantum alibi usurpare,
   Marc. xvi. 12, idque eo sensu quo non naturam, sed exteriorem speciem
   significat, cum ait, Jesum duobus discipulis suis apparuisse alia
   forma."Ex iis vero verbis, quæ apostolus paulo post subjecit, Habitu
   inventus est ut homo, nonne apparet eum (ut loquuntur) incarnstum esse?
   -- Nullo modo; etenim ea oratio nihil in se habet ejusmodi. De Samsone
   enim in literis sacris legimus, quod idem futurus erat ut homo, Judic.
   xvi. 7, 11; et Ps. lxxxii., Asaph iis hominibus quos deos et filios
   Altissimi, vocaverat, denunciat, quod essent morituri ut homines; de

   fuisse."Qua ratione locum hunc totum intelligis? -- Ad eum modum, quod
   Christus, qui in mundo, instar Dei, opera Dei efficiebat, et cui, sicut
   Deo, omnia parebant, et cui divina adoratio exhibebatur, -- ita volente
   Deo, et hominum salute exigente, -- factus est tanquam servus et
   mancipium, et tanqusm unus ex aliis vulgaribus hominibus, cum ultro se
   capi, vinciri, cædi, et occidi permiserat."

   [346] "Qui porro ad ea loca respondes, etc.? -- Quod Christus sit
   æqualis Deo, id divinam in eo naturam hullo modo probat: imo hinc res
   adversa colligitur; nam si Christus Deo, qui natura Deus est, æqualis
   est, efficitur, quod is idem Deus esse non possit. A Equalitas vero
   Christi cum Deo in eo est, quod ea virtute quam in eum contulit Deus,
   ea omnia efficeret, et efficiat, quæ ipsius Dei sunt, tanquam Deus
   ipse."

   [347] "Ad tertium vero quid respondes? -- Primum quidem, quod in multis
   exemplaribus vetustis, et in ipsa Vulgata, non legatur vox Deus; quare
   ex eo loco certum nihil concludi potest. Deinde, etiamsi ea vox
   legeretur, nullam esse causam cur ad Patrem referri non possit, cum hæc
   de Patre affirmari possint, eum apparuisse in Christo, et apostolis,
   qui caro fuerunt. Quod autem inferius legitur, secundum usitatam
   versionem, Receptus est in gloriam, id in Græco habetur, Receptus est
   in gloria, -- id est, cum gloria, aut gloriose."Quæ vero futura eat
   hujus testimonii sentontis? -- Religionem Christi plenam esse

   per homines infirmos et mortales perfecte patefacta eat; et nihilominus
   tamen propter miracula et Tirtutes varias quæ per homines illos
   infirmos et mortales edita fuerant, pro vera eat agnita; eadem ab ipsis
   angelis fuit demum perspecta; non solum Judæis, verum etiam Gentibus
   fuit prædicata: omnes ei crediderunt, et insignem in modum, et summa
   cum gloria recepta fuit."

   [348] Griesbach, Lachman, and Tischendorf, have decided for hos as the
   true reading. Knapp, Tittmann, Scholz, Henderson, Bloomfield, and Moses
   Stuart, abide by Theos. Tischendorf refers to seven manuscripts, --
   four of them being in uncial characters, -- as his authority for hos.
   Upwards of one hundred and fifty manuscripts have Theos. It is a
   question, however, to be determined not by the number of the
   manuscripts merely, but by their value and authority; and the reader is
   referred on this subject to Dr Henderson's dissertation, "The Great
   Mystery of Godliness Incontrovertible," and the second edition of
   Tischendorf's New Testament, -- Ed.

   [349] In the Syriac version, as edited by Tremellius, the word "God" is
   certainly to be found. It seems however, to be one of the emendations
   which that learned Jewish convert to Christianity professed to make in
   the Syriac original, which unquestionably supports the other reading.

   reddunt, et vulgo eo sensu accipiunt) sed assumere. Nec dicit, naturam
   humanam, sed semen Abrahæ, quod in literis sacris notat cos qui in
   Christum crediderunt, ut Gal. iii. 29, videre est. "Quid vero sensus

Chapter XIV.

   Sundry other testimonies given to the deity of Christ vindicated.

   In the next place they heap up a great many testimonies confusedly,
   containing scriptural attributions unto Christ of such things as
   manifest him to be God; which we shall consider in that order, or
   rather disorder, wherein they are placed of them.

   Their first question here is:--

   Ques. In what scriptures is Christ called God?

   Ans. John i. 1, "The Word was God;" John xx. 28, "Thomas saith unto
   Christ, My Lord and my God;" Rom. ix. 5, the apostle saith that "Christ
   is God over all, blessed for ever."

   Q. What can be proved by these testimonies?

   A. That a divine nature cannot be demonstrated from them, besides the
   things that are before produced, is hence manifest, that in the first
   testimony the Word is spoken of, and John saith that he was" with God;"
   in the second, Thomas calleth him "God" in whose feet and hands he
   found the print of the nails, and of the spear in his side; and Paul
   calleth him who according to the flesh was of the fathers, "God over
   all, blessed for ever;" -- all which cannot be spoken of him who by
   nature is God, for thence it would follow that there are two Gods, of
   whom one was with the other; and these things, to have the prints of
   wounds and to be of the fathers, belong wholly to a man, which were
   absurd to ascribe to him who is God by nature. And if any one shall
   pretend that veil of the distinction of natures, we have above removed
   that, and have showed that this distinction cannot be maintained. [353]

   That in all this answer our catechists do nothing but beg the thing in
   question, and flee to their own hypothesis, not against assertions but
   arguments, themselves so far know as to be forced to apologize for it
   in the close. 1. That Christ is not God because he is not the person of
   the Father, that he is not God because he is man, is the sum of their
   answer; and yet these men knew that we insisted on these testimonies to
   prove him God though he be man, and though he be not the same person
   with the Father. 2. They do all along impose upon us their own most
   false hypothesis, that Christ is God although he be not God by nature.
   Those who are not God by nature, and yet pretend to be gods, are idols,
   and shall be destroyed. And they only are the men who affirm there are
   two Gods, -- one who is so by nature, and another made so; one indeed
   God, and no man; the other a man, and no God. The Lord our God is one
   God. 3. In particular, John i. 1, the Word is Christ, as hath been
   above abundantly demonstrated, -- Christ, in respect of another nature
   than he had before he took flesh and dwelt with men, verse 14. Herein
   is he said to be with the Father, in respect of his distinct personal
   subsistence, who was one with the Father as to his nature and essence.
   And this is that which we prove from his testimony, which will not be
   warded with a bare denial: "The Word was with God, and the Word was
   God;" -- God by nature, and with God in his personal distinction. 4.
   Thomas confesses him to be his Lord and God in whose hands and feet he
   saw the print of the nails, as God is said to redeem the church with
   his own blood. He was the Lord and God of Thomas, who in his human
   nature shed his blood, and had the print of the nails in his hands and
   feet. Of this confession of Thomas I have spoken before, and therefore
   I shall not now farther insist upon it. He whom Thomas, in the
   confession of his faith as a believer, owned for his Lord and God, he
   is the true God, God by nature. Of a made god, a god by office, to be
   confessed and believed in, the Scripture is utterly silent. 5. The same
   is affirmed of Rom. ix. 5. The apostle distinguishes of Christ as to
   his flesh and as to his deity: as to his flesh or human nature, he says
   he was of the fathers; but in the other regard he is "over all, God
   blessed for ever." And as this is a signal expression of the trim God,
   "God over all, blessed for ever," so there is no occasion of that
   expression, to kata sarka, "as to the flesh," but to assert something
   in Christ, which he afterward affirms to be his everlasting deity, in
   regard whereof he is not of the fathers. He is, then, of the fathers,
   to kata sarka ho o epi panton Theos eulogetos eis tous aionos amen The
   words are most emphatically expressive of the eternal deity of Christ,
   in contradistinction to what he received of the fathers. Ho on, even
   then when he took flesh of the fathers, then was he, and now he is, and
   ever will be, "God over all," that is, the Most High God, "blessed for
   ever." It is evident that the apostle intends to ascribe to Christ here
   two most solemn attributes of God, -- the Most High, and the Blessed
   One. Nor is this testimony to be parted with for their begging or with
   their importunity. 6. It is our adversaries who say there are two Gods,
   as hath been showed, not we; and the prints of wounds are proper to him
   who is God by nature, though not in that regard on the account whereof
   he is so. 7. What they have said to oppose the distinction of two
   natures in the one person of Christ hath already been considered, and
   manifested to be false and frivolous.

   I could wish to these testimonies they had added one or two more, as
   that of Isa. liv. 5, "Thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is
   his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole
   earth shall he be called." That Jesus Christ is the husband and spouse
   of the church will not be denied, Eph. v. 25, Rev. xxi. 9; but he who
   is so is "The Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel, the God of the
   whole earth." And Heb. iii. 4, the apostle says, "He that made all
   things is God," -- that is, his church, for of that he treats. He that
   created all things, -- that is, "the church, as well as all other
   things,' -- he is God, none could do it but God; but Christ built this
   house, verse 3. But this is not my present employment.

   The learned Grotius is pitifully entangled about the last two places
   urged by our catechists. Of his sleight in dealing with that of John
   xx. 28, I have spoken before, and discovered the vanity of his
   insinuations. Here he tells you, that after Christ's resurrection, it
   grew common with the Christians to call him God, and urges Rom. ix. 5;
   but coming to expound that place, he finds that shift will not serve
   the turn, it being not any Christians calling him God that there is
   mentioned, but the blessed apostle plainly affirming that he is "God
   over all, blessed for ever;" and therefore, forgetting what he had said
   before, he falls upon a worse and more desperate evasion, affirming
   that the word Theos ought not to be in the text, because Erasmus had
   observed that Cyprian and Hilary, citing this text, did not name the
   word! And this he rests upon, although he knew that all original copies
   whatever, constantly, without any exception, do read it, and that Beza
   had manifested, against Erasmus, that Cyprian adver. Judæos, lib. ii.
   cap. vi., and Hilary ad Ps. xii., do both cite this place to prove that
   Christ is called God, though they do not express the text to the full;
   and it is known how Athanasius used it against the Arians, without any
   hesitation as to the corruption of the text. This way of shifting
   indeed is very wretched, and not to be pardoned. I am well contented
   with all who, from what he writes on John i. 1 (the first place
   mentioned), do apprehend that when he wrote his annotations on that
   place he was no opposer of the deity of Christ; but I must take leave
   to say, that, for mine own part, I am not able to collect from all
   there spoken in his own words that he doth at all assert the assuming
   of the human nature into personal subsistence with the Son of God. I
   speak as to the thing itself, and not to the expressions which he
   disallows. But we must proceed with our catechists:--

   Q. Where doth the Scripture testify that Christ is one with the Father?

   A. John x. 29-31, "My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all;
   and no man is able to pluck them out of his hand. I and my Father are
   one. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him."

   Q. How dost thou answer this testimony?

   A. That from hence, that Christ is said to be one with the Father, it
   cannot be proved that he is one with him in nature, the words of Christ
   to his Father of the disciples do show: John xvii. 11," That they may
   he one, as we are;" and a little after, verse 22, "That they may be
   one, even as we are one." That Christ is one with the Father, this
   ought to be understood either of will or power in the business of our
   salvation. Whence that a divine nature cannot be proved is manifest
   from those places where Christ saith his Father is greater than all,
   and, consequently, than Christ himself, as he expressly confesseth, and
   that he gave him his sheep, John xiv. 28. [354]

   Of this place I have spoken before. That it is an unity of essence that
   is here intended by our Saviour appears, -- 1. From the apprehension
   the Jews had of his meaning in those words, who immediately upon them
   took up stones to stone him for blasphemy, rendering an account of
   their so doing, verse 33, "Because he, being a man, did make himself
   God." 2. From the exposition he makes himself of his words, verse 36,
   "I am the Son of God;" -- "That is it I intended; I am so one with him
   as a son is with his father," -- that is, one in nature and essence. 3.
   He is so one with him as that the Father is in him, and he in him, by a
   divine immanency of persons.

   Those words of our Saviour, John xvii. 11, 22, 1. Do not argue a parity
   in the union of believers among themselves with that of him and his
   Father: but a similitude (see John xvii. 20), -- that they may be one
   in affection, as his Father and he are in essence. We are to be holy,
   as God is holy. 2. If oneness of will and consent be the ground of
   this, that the Son and Father are one, then the angels and God are one,
   for with their wills they always do his. 3. Oneness of power with God
   in any work argues oneness of essence. God's power is omnipotent, and
   none can be one with him in power but he who is omnipotent, -- that is,
   who is God. And if it be unity of power which is here asserted, it is
   spoken absolutely, and not referred to any particular kind of thing. 4.
   It is true, God the Father is greater than Christ, as is affirmed John
   xiv. 28, in respect of his office of mediation, of which there he
   treats; but they are one and equal in respect of nature. Neither is God
   in this place said to be greater than all in respect of Christ, who is
   said to be one with him, but in reference to all that may be supposed
   to attempt the taking of his sheep out of his hands. 5. Christ took or
   received his sheep, not simply as God, the eternal Son of God, but as
   mediator; and so his Father was greater than he. This testimony, then,
   abides: He that is one with the Father is God by nature; Christ is thus
   one with the Father. "One" is the unity of nature; "are," their
   distinction of persons, "I and my Father are one."

   Grotius adheres to the same exposition with our catechists, only he
   goes one step farther in corrupting the text. His words are: "?Ego kai
   ho Pater hen esmen. Connectit quod dixerat cum superioribus. Si Patris
   potestati eripi non poterunt, nec meæ poterunt; nam mea potestas a
   Patre emanat, et quidem ita, ut tantundem valeat a me, aut a Patre,
   custodiri. Vid. Gen. xli. 25, 27." I suppose he means verse 44, being
   the words of Pharaoh delegating power and authority immediately under
   him to Joseph; -- but, as it is known, potestas is exousia,
   "authority," and may belong to office; but potentia is dunamis,
   "force," "virtue," or "power," and belongs to essence. It is not
   potestas or authority that Christ speaks of, but strength, might, and
   power, which is so great in God that none can take his sheep out of his
   hand. Now, though unitas potestatis doth not prove unity of essence in
   men, yet unitas potentiæ, which is here spoken of, in God evidently
   doth; yea, none can have unitatem potestatis with God but he who hath
   unitatem essentiæ.

   What they except in the next place against Christ's being equal with
   God, from John v. 18, Phil. ii. 6, 7, hath been already removed, and
   the places fully vindicated. They proceed:--

   Q. But where is it that Christ is called the "Son of the living God,"
   the "proper" and "only-begotten Son of God?"

   A. Matt. xvi. 16; Rom. viii. 32; John iii. 16, 18.

   Q. But how are these places answered?

   A. From all these attributes of Christ a divine nature can by no means
   be proved; for as to the first, it is notorious that Peter confessed
   that the Son of man was Christ and the Son of the living God, who, as
   it is evident, bad not such a divine nature as they feign. Besides, the
   Scripture testifieth of other men that they are the sons of the living
   God, as the apostle out of Hosea, Rom. ix. 26. And as to what belongeth
   to the second and third places, in them we read that the "proper" and
   "only-begotten Son of God" was delivered to death; which cannot be said
   of him who is God by nature. Yea, from hence, that Christ is the Son of
   God, it appears that he is not God, for otherwise he should be Son to
   himself. But the cause why these attributes belong to Christ is this,
   that he is the chiefest and most dear to God among all the sons of God:
   as Isaac, because he was most dear to Abraham, and was his heir, is
   called his "only-begotten son," Heb. xi. 17, although he had his
   brother Ishmael; and Solomon the "only-begotten of his mother,"
   although he had many brethren by the same mother, 1 Chron. iii. 1-6,
   etc.; Prov. iv. 3. [355]

   I have spoken before fully to all these places, and therefore shall be
   very brief in the vindication of them in this place. On what account
   Christ is, and on what account alone he is called, the Son of God, hath
   been sufficiently demonstrated, and his unity of nature with his Father
   thence evinced. It is true, -- 1. That Peter calls Christ, who was the
   Son of man, the "Son of the living God;" not in that or on that account
   whereon he is the Son of man, but because he is peculiarly, in respect
   of another nature than that wherein he is the Son of man, the Son of
   the living God. And if Peter had intended no more in this assertion but
   only that he was one among the many sons of God, how doth he answer
   that question, "But whom say ye that I am?" being exceptive to what
   others said, who yet affirmed that he was a prophet, one come out from
   God, and favoured of him. It is evident that it is something much more
   noble and divine that is here affirmed by him, in this solemn
   confession of him on whom the church is built. It is true, believers
   are called "children of the living God," Rom. ix. 26, in opposition to
   the idols whom they served before their conversion; neither do we argue
   from this expression barely, "Of the living God," but in conjunction
   with those others that follow, and in the emphaticalness of it, in this
   confession of Peter, Christ instantly affirming that this was a rock
   which should not be prevailed against. 2. What is meant by the "proper"
   and "only-begotten Son of God" hath been already abundantly evinced.
   Nor is it disproved by saying that the proper and only Son of God was
   given to death, for so he was; and thereby "God redeemed his church
   with his own blood." He that is the proper and only-begotten Son of God
   was given to death, though not in that nature and in respect of that
   wherein he is the proper and only-begotten Son of God. 3. Christ is the
   Son of the Father, who is God, and therein the Son of God, without any
   danger of being "the Son of himself," that is, of God as he is the Son.
   This is a begging of the thing in question, without offering any plea
   for what they pretend to but their own unbelief and carnal
   apprehensions of the things of God. 4. Our catechists have exceedingly
   forgotten themselves and their masters, in affirming that "Christ is
   called the proper and only-begotten Son of God, because he is most dear
   to God of all his sons;" themselves and their master having, as was
   showed at large before, given us reasons quite of another nature for
   this appellation, which we have discussed and disproved elsewhere. 5.
   If Christ be the only-begotten Son of God only on this account, because
   he is most dear among all the sons of God, then he is the Son of God
   upon the same account with them, -- that is, by regeneration and
   adoption; which that it is most false hath been showed elsewhere.
   Christ is the proper, natural, only-begotten Son of God, in
   contradistinction to all others, the adopted sons of God, as was made
   manifest. Isaac is called the "only-begotten son" of Abraham, not
   absolutely, but in reference to the promise; he was his only-begotten
   son to whom the promise did belong: "He that had received the promises
   offered up his only-begotten son." Solomon is not said to be the
   "only-begotten of his mother," Prov. iv. 3, but only "before the face"
   or "in the sight of his mother," eminently expressing his preferment as
   to her affections. How little is this to what the gospel says of Jesus
   Christ!

   I have only to say concerning Grotius in this matter, that from none of
   these expressions, in any place, doth he take the least notice of what
   is necessarily concluded concerning the deity of Christ; wherein he
   might use his own liberty. The opening, interpretation, and improvement
   of these testimonies to the end aimed at, I desire the reader to see,
   chap. vii. They proceed:--

   Q. What scripture calls Christ the "first-born of every creature"?

   A. Col. i. 15.

   Q. What dost thou answer thereunto?

   A. Neither can it hence be gathered that Christ hath a divine nature:
   for seeing Christ is the "first-born of every creature," it is
   necessary that he be one of the number of the creatures; for such is
   the force of the word "first-born" in the Scriptures, that it is of
   necessity that he who is first-born be one of the number of them of
   whom he is the first-born, Col. i. 18; Rom. viii. 29; Rev. i. 5.
   Neither that our Lord Jesus was one of the things created in the old
   creation can our adversaries grant, unless they will be Arians. It
   behoveth them that they grant him to be one of the new creation. From
   whence not only the divine nature of Christ cannot be proved, but also
   that Christ hath no such divine nature is firmly evinced. But now that
   Jesus is called by that name by the apostle, it is from hence, that in
   time and worth he far exceedeth all other things of the new creation.
   [356]

   1. That by the "creation" in this verse, and the things enumerated to
   be created in the verses following, are intended the creation of the
   world, and all things therein, "visible and invisible," was before
   abundantly evinced, in the consideration of the ensuing verses, and the
   exceptions of these catechists wholly removed from being any hinderance
   to the embracing of the first obvious sense of the words All, then,
   that is here inferred from a supposition of the new creation being here
   intended (which is a most vain supposition) falls to the ground of
   itself; so that I shall not need to take the least farther notice of
   it. 2. That Christ is so the first-born of the old creation as to be a
   prince, heir, and lord of it, and the things thereof (which is the
   sense of the word as here used), and yet not one of them, is evident
   from the context. The very next words to these, "He is the first-born
   of every creature," are, "For by him were all things created." He by
   whom all things, all creatures, were created, is no creature; for he
   else must create himself. And so we are neither Arians nor Photinians.
   Though the former have more colour of saving themselves from the sword
   of the word than the latter, yet they both perish by it. 3. The word
   prototokos, "first-born," in this place is metaphorical, and the
   expression is intended to set out the excellency of Christ above all
   other things That that is the design of the Holy Ghost in the place is
   confessed. Now, whereas the word may import two things concerning him
   of whom it is spoken, -- (1.) that he is one of them in reference to
   whom he is said to be the first-born, or, (2.) that he hath privilege,
   pre-eminence, rule, and inheritance of them and over them, -- I ask,
   Which of these significations suits the apostle's aim here, to set out
   the excellency of Christ above all creatures? that which makes him one
   of them, or that which exalts him above them? 4. Prototokos tases
   ktiseos, is "begotten before all creatures," or "every creature." The
   apostle doth not say Christ was protos ktistheis, "the first of them
   made," but, he was born or begotten before them all, -- that is, from
   eternity. His being begotten is opposed to the creation of all other
   things; and though the word, where express mention is made of others in
   the same kind, may denote one of them, yet where it is used concerning
   things so far distant, and which are not compared, but one preferred
   above the other, it requires no such signification. See Job xviii. 13;
   Ps. lxxxix. 27; Jer. xxxi. 9.

   Grotius is perfectly agreed with our catechists, and uses their very
   words in the exposition of this place; but that also hath been
   considered, and his exposition called to an account formerly.

   The next testimonies insisted on they produce in answer to this
   question:--

   Q. What scriptures affirm that Christ hath all things that the Father
   hath?

   A. John xvi. 15, xvii. 10.

   Q. What sayest thou to these?

   A. We have above declared that the word omnia, "all things," is almost
   always referred to the subject-matter; wherefore from these places that
   which they intend can no way be proved. The subject-matter, chap. xvi.,
   is that which the Holy Spirit was to reveal to the apostles, which
   belonged to the kingdom of Christ; and, chap. xvii., it is most
   apparent that he treateth of his disciples, whom God gave him, whom he
   calls his. Moreover, seeing that whatever Christ hath, he hath it by
   gift from the Father, and not of himself, it hence appeareth that he
   can by no means have a divine nature, when he who is God by nature hath
   all things of himself. [357]

   Of these texts the consideration will soon be despatched. 1. John xiv.
   15, Christ saith, "All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore
   said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you." Now,
   if all things that the Father hath are his, then the divine nature is
   his, for the Father hath a divine nature. But they say this "all
   things" is to be expounded according to the subject-matter treated of;
   that is, only what the Holy Ghost was to reveal to the apostles. Let,
   then, the expression be expounded according to the subject-matter.
   Christ renders a reason why he said that the Spirit should take of his:
   even because what he had of the Father he had also of him, all that the
   Father hath being his. Now, it was the knowledge of all truth, and all
   things to come, and all things concerning the kingdom of Christ, that
   he was thus to show to the apostles. But look, whence the Holy Ghost
   hath his knowledge, thence he hath his essence; for those things do not
   really differ in a divine nature. The Spirit, then, having his
   knowledge of the Son, hath also his essence of the Son, as he hath of
   the Father. And by this it is most evidently confirmed, that among the
   "all things" that the Father hath, which the Son hath, his divine
   nature is also, or else that could be no reason why he should say that
   the Spirit should take of his, and show to them.

   2. John xvii. 10, a reason is rendered why those who are Christ's are
   also God's, and to be in his care; that is, because all his things (ta
   ema panta) were the Father's, and all the Father's his. It is not,
   then, spoken of the disciples; but is a reason given why the disciples
   are so in the love of God, because of the unity of essence which is
   between Father and Son, whence all the Son's things are the Father's,
   and all the Father's are the Son's.

   3. Christ's having all things not from himself, but by gift from the
   Father, may be understood two ways. Either it refers to the nature of
   Christ as he is God, or to the person of Christ as he is the Son of
   God. In the first sense it is false; for the nature of Christ being one
   with that of the Father hath all things, without concession, gift, or
   grant made to it, as the nature. But as the person of the Son, in which
   regard he receives all things, even his nature, from the Father, so it
   is true (those words being expounded as above); but this only proves
   him to be the Son of God, not at all that he is not God.

   Grotius on the first place, Panta hosa echei ho pater ema esti "Etiam
   præscientia et decreta de rebus futuris, quatenus ecclesiam spectant."
   Did he truly intend what the first words do import, we should judge
   ourselves not a little beholding to him. The foreknowledge of God is
   not in any who is not God, nor his decrees. The first is an eternal
   property of his nature; the latter are eternal acts of his will. If
   Christ have these, he must have the nature of God. But the last words
   evidently take away what the first seem to grant, by restraining this
   participation of Christ in the foreknowledge and decrees of God to
   things concerning the church; in which sense Socinus grants the
   knowledge of Christ to be infinite, namely, in respect of the church,
   Disput. de Adorat. Christi cum Christiano Franken, p. 15. But it being
   certain that he whose the prescience of God and his purposes are
   properly as to any one thing, his they are universally, it is too
   evident that he intends these things to belong to Christ no otherwise
   but as God revealeth the things that are to come concerning his church
   to him; which respects his office as Mediator, not his nature as he is
   one with God, blessed for ever. Of the deity of Christ, neither in this
   nor the other place is there the least intimation in that author.

   Q. But what scripture calleth Christ "the eternal Father?"

   A. Isa. ix. 6.

   Q. What sayest thou thereunto?

   A. From thence a divine nature cannot be proved, seeing Christ is
   called the "Father of eternity" for a certain cause, as may be seen
   from the words there a little before expressed. But it is marvellous
   that the adversaries will refer this place to the Son, which treats of
   the eternal Father, who, as it is evident, according to themselves, is
   not the Father. But Christ is said to be the "Father of eternity," or
   of the "world to come," because he is the prince and author of eternal
   life, which is future. [358]

   It were well for our adversaries if they could thus shift off this
   testimony. Let the words be considered, and it will quickly appear what
   need they have of other helps, if they intend to escape this sword that
   is furbished against them and their cause. The words of the verse are,
   "For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the
   government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
   Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
   Prince of Peace."

   1. Our catechists, confessing that this is spoken of Christ, and that
   he is here called "The everlasting Father" (they are more modest than
   Grotius, whose labour to corrupt this place is to be bewailed, having
   ventured on the words as far as any of the modern rabbins, who yet make
   it their business to divert this text from being applied to the
   Messiah), have saved me the labour of proving from the text and context
   that he only can possibly be intended. This, then, being taken for
   granted, that is that which is here affirmed of him, that "his name
   shall be called," or "he shall be," and "shall be known to be" (for
   both these are contained in this expression), "Wonderful, Counsellor,
   The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." He who is
   "The mighty God" and "The everlasting Father" is God by nature; but so
   is Jesus Christ. The expression here used of "The mighty God" is
   ascribed to God, Deut. x. 17, Neh. ix. 32, Jer. xxxii. 18; and is a
   most eminent name of God, -- a name discriminating him from all that
   are not God by nature. And this may be added to the other names of God
   that are attributed to Christ: as "Adonai," Ps. cx. 1; -- "Elohim," Ps.
   xlv. 6; Heb. i. 8; -- "Jehovah," Jer. xxxiii. 6, xxxiii. 16; Mal. iii.
   1; Ps. lxxxiii. 18; -- "God," John i. 1; -- "The true God," 1 John v.
   20; -- "The great God," Tit. ii. 13, (of which places before); -- and
   here "The mighty God, The everlasting Father."

   2. What say our catechists to all this? They fix only on that
   expression, "The eternal Father," and say that we cannot intend the Son
   here, because we say he is not the Father; and yet so do these
   gentlemen themselves! They say Christ is the Son of God, and no way the
   same with the Father; and yet they say that upon a peculiar account he
   is here called "The eternal Father."

   3. On what account, then, soever Christ is called "The eternal Father,"
   yet he is called so, and is eternal. Whether it be because in nature he
   is one with the Father, or because of his tender and fatherly
   affections to his church, or because he is the author of eternal life,
   or because in him is life, it is all one as to the testimony to his
   deity in the words produced. He who is "The mighty God, The everlasting
   Father, The Prince of Peace," is God by nature; which was to be
   confirmed.

   So much for them. But our other friend must not be forgotten. The place
   is of great importance, the testimony in it evident and clear; and we
   must not suffer ourselves, on any pretence, to be deprived of the
   support thereof. Thus, then, he proceeds in the exposition of this
   place:--

   "For unto us a child is born." "Id est, nascetur. Nam Hebræa præterita
   sumuntur pro futuris;" -- "That is, shall be born," etc. Of this we
   shall have use in the very next words.

   "Unto us a Son is given." "Dabitur. Ezechias patri Achazo multum
   dissimilis. Sic tamen ut multo excellentius hæc ad Messiam pertinere,
   non Christiani tantum agnoscant, sed et Chaldæus hoc loco;" -- that is,
   "Shall be given. Hezekiah, most unlike his father Ahaz. Yet so that
   these things belong more excellently to the Messiah, not only as the
   Christians acknowledge, but the Chaldee in this place."

   Here begins the exposition. Hezekiah is intended. So, indeed, say some
   of the rabbins. But, -- 1. This prophecy is evidently a continuance of
   that which is begun chap. vii., and was given at the time of the
   invasion of Judah by Rezin and Pekah; which was after Ahaz had reigned
   some years, as is evident, 2 Kings xvi. 1-5. Now, he reigned but
   sixteen years in all, and when Hezekiah came to the crown, in
   succession to him, he was twenty-five years of age, 2 Kings xviii. 1,
   2; so that he must needs be born before this prophecy. There is, then,
   already an inconsistency in these annotations, making the prophet to
   speak of that which was past as future and to come.

   2. It is true that the Chaldee paraphrast applies this prophecy unto
   the Messiah, whose words are, "Dicit propheta domui David; quoniam
   parvulus natus est nobis, Filius datus est nobis, et suscepit legem
   super se, ut servaret eam; et vocabitur nomen ejus, a facie admirabilis
   consilii Deus, vir permanens in æternum; Christus cujus pax
   multiplicabitur super nos in diebus ejus." He not only refers the whole
   to Christ, without any intimation of Hezekiah, but says also that his
   name shall be "The God of counsel."

   3. Neither is he alone, but the ancient rabbins generally are of the
   same judgment, as Petrus Galatinus and Raymundus Martinus abundantly
   manifest. To repeat what is or may be collected from them to that
   purpose is not much to mine.

   4. The present difference between us and the learned annotator is,
   whether Hezekiah be here intended at all or no. To what hath been
   spoken we have that to add in opposition to him which we chiefly insist
   upon, namely, that none of the things ascribed to the person here
   spoken of can be attributed to Hezekiah, as expressing somewhat more
   divine than can be ascribed to any mere man whatever. Indeed, as
   Grotius wrests the words in his following interpretation, they may be
   ascribed to any other; for he leaves no name of God, nor any expression
   of any thing divine, to him that is spoken of.

   Among the rabbins that interpret this place of Hezekiah, one of the
   chief said he was the Messiah indeed, and that they were to look for no
   other! This is the judgment of Rabbi Hillel in the Talmud. Hence,
   because Maimonides said somewhere that the faith of the Messiah to come
   is the foundation of the law, it is disputed by Rabbi Joseph Albo,
   Orat. i. cap. i., whether Hillel were not to be reckoned among the
   apostates and such as should have no portion in the world to come; but
   he resolves the question on Hillel's side, and denies that the faith of
   the Messiah to come is the foundation of the law. Others, who apply
   these words to Hezekiah, say he should have been the Messiah, but that
   God altered his purpose upon the account which they assign. This they
   prove from verse 6, where, in the word lmrbh?, "mem clausum" is put in
   the middle of a word. This Grotius takes notice of, and says, "Eo
   stabilitatem significari volunt Hebræi, ut per mem aperture in fine
   rupturam." Perhaps sometimes they do so, but here some of them turn it
   to another purpose, as they may use it to what purpose they please, the
   observation being ludicrous. The words of Rabbi Tanchum, in libro
   Sanhedrim, to this purpose, are: "Dixit Rabbi Tanchum, Quomodo omne mem
   quod est in medio vocis aperture est, et istud lmrbh?, Isa. ix. 6,
   clausum est? Quæsivit Deus sanctus benedictus facere Ezechiam Messiam,
   et Sennacheribum Gog et Magog. Dixit proprietas judicii coram eo,
   Domine mundi, et quid Davidem, qui dixit faciei tuæ tot cantica et
   laudes, non fecisti Messiam, Ezechiam vero, cui fecisti omnia signa
   hæc, et non dixit canticum faciei tuæ, vis facere Messiam?' Propterea
   clausum fuit statim, etc. Egressa est vox coelestis, Secretum meum
   mihi;'?" -- "Rabbi Tanchum said, Seeing every mem that is in the middle
   of a word is open, how comes that in lmrbh? to be closed? The holy,
   blessed God sought to make Hezekiah to be the Messiah, and Sennacherib
   to be Gog and Magog. Propriety of judgment" (that is, the right measure
   of judgment), "said before him, Lord of the whole earth, why didst thou
   not make David Messiah, who spake so many songs and praises before
   thee? and wilt [thou] make Hezekiah to be the Messiah, for whom thou
   hast wrought those great signs, and he spake no song before thee?'
   Instantly mem was shut, and a heavenly voice went forth, My secret
   belongs to me.'?"

   And so Hezekiah lost the Messiahship for want of a song! And these are
   good masters in the interpretation of prophecies concerning Christ. I
   wholly assent to the conjecture of the learned annotator about this
   business: "Non incredibile est," says he, "quod unus scriba properans
   commiserat, id, alios superstitiose imitatos;" -- "One began this
   writing by negligence, and others followed him with superstition." The
   conjectures of some Christians from hence are with me of no more weight
   than those of the Jews: as, that by this mem clausum is signified the
   birth of Christ of a virgin; and whereas in number it signifies six
   hundred, it denotes the space of time at the end whereof Christ was to
   be born, which was so many years from the fourth of Ahaz, wherein this
   prophecy, as is supposed, was given.

   I have not insisted on these things as though they were of any
   importance, or in themselves worthy to be repeated, when men are
   dealing seriously about the things of God, but only to show what little
   cause Grotius had to follow the modern rabbins in their exposition of
   this place, whose conceits upon it are so foolish and ridiculous.

   Return we to the Annotations. The first passage he fixes on is, "And
   the government shall be upon his shoulder." Saith he, "Id est, erit
   porphurogenetos, ab ipsis cunis purpuram feret regiam, ut in regnum
   natus. Confer Ezech. xxviii. 13;" -- "He shall be born to purple; from
   his very cradle he shall wear the kingly purple, being born to the
   kingdom."

   1. But this is nothing peculiar to Hezekiah. His son Manasseh was all
   this as well as he; and how this, being in itself a light and trivial
   thing, common to all other kings' sons with him, should be thus
   prophesied of as an eminent honour and glory, none can see any cause.
   2. But is this indeed the meaning of these words, "Hezekiah, when he is
   a boy, shall wear a purple coat?" which the prophet, when he gave forth
   this prophecy, perhaps saw him playing in every day. Certainly it is a
   sad thing to be forsaken of God, and to be given up to a man's own
   understanding in the exposition of the Scripture. That the government,
   the principality here mentioned, which is said to be upon the shoulder
   of him concerning whom the words are spoken, -- that is, committed to
   him as a weighty thing, -- is the whole rule and government of the
   church of God, committed to the management of the Lord Jesus Christ,
   the mediator, to the inconceivable benefit and consolation of his
   people, the reader may find evinced in all expositors on the place
   (unless some one or other of late, persons of note, who, to appear
   somebodies, have ventured to follow Grotius); it is not my business to
   insist on particulars.

   His next note is on these words, "His name shall be called." "In Hebræo
   est vocabit; supple quisque. Etiam Chaldæus vocabitur transtulit. Notum
   autem Hebræis dici sic vel sic vocari aliquem cui tales tituli aut
   epitheta conveniunt." I delight not to contend at all, nor shall do it
   without great cause. For the sense of these words, I am content that we
   take up thus much: The titles following are his names, and they agree
   to him; that is, he is, or shall be, such an one as answers the
   description in them given of him. But here our great doctors, whom this
   great man follows, are divided. Some of them not seeing how it is
   possible that the names following should be ascribed to Hezekiah, some
   of them directly terming him "God," they pervert the words, and read
   them thus: "The wonderful Counsellor, the mighty God, etc., shall call
   his name The Prince of Peace;" so ascribing the last name only to
   Hezekiah, all the former to God. The advantage they take is from the
   want of variation by cases in the Hebrew. And this way go all the
   present rabbins, being set into it by Solomon Jarchi on the place. But
   as this is expressly contrary to the judgment of the old doctors, [359]
   as hath been abundantly proved out of their Targum and Talmud, where
   Hezekiah is called the "lord of eight names," and is opposed to
   Sennacherib, who they say had eight names also, so it is contrary to
   all their own rules of grammar to place the name of him who calls after
   the verb calling, of which there is not one instance to be given.
   Grotius, therefore, takes in with them who apply all these names to
   Hezekiah, shift with them afterward as well as he can. So he
   proceeds:--

   "Wonderful." "Ob summas quæ in eo erunt virtutes;" -- "For the
   excellent virtues that shall be in him." But, I pray, why more than
   David or Josiah? "This is his name, Wonderful;' that is, he shall be
   very virtuous, and men shall admire him." How much better this name
   agrees to Him, and how much more proper it is, whose person is so great
   a mystery, 1 Tim. iii. 16, and whose name is so abstruse, Prov. xxx. 4,
   and that upon the wonderful conjunction of two natures in one person,
   here mentioned (he who is "The mighty God" being also "a child given"
   unto us), is evident to all.

   "Counsellor, The mighty God." "Imo consultator Dei fortis; id est, qui
   in omnibus negotiis consilia a Deo poscet, per Prophetas scilicet, ut
   jam sequetur;" -- "Yea, he who asketh counsel of the mighty God;' that
   is, who in all his affairs asks counsel of God, namely, by the
   prophet."

   And is not this boldness thus to correct the text, "Counsellor, The
   mighty God," "Yea, he who asketh counsel of the mighty God?" What
   colour, what pretence, what reason or plea, may be used for this
   perverting the words of the text, our annotator not in the least
   intimates.

   The words are evidently belonging to the same person, equally parts of
   that name whereby he is to be called; and the casting of them, without
   any cause, into this construction, in a matter of this importance
   (because it is to be said), is intolerable boldness. It is, not without
   great probability of truth, pleaded by some, that the first two words
   should go together, "The wonderful Counsellor," as those that follow
   do; -- not that pl'?, "admirabilis," is an epithet, or an adjective, it
   being a substantive, and signifying a wonder or a miracle; but that the
   weight of what is said being laid much upon the force of "Counsellor,"
   setting out the infinite wisdom of Christ, in all his ways, purposes,
   and counsels concerning his church, this other term seems to be suited
   to the setting forth thereof. But this corruption of the text is the
   more intolerable in our annotator, because, in the close of his
   observations on this place, he confesses that all the things here
   mentioned have a signification in Christ, much more sublime and plain
   than that which he hath insisted on; so that had he been any friend to
   the deity of Christ he would not have endeavoured to have robbed him of
   his proper name, "The mighty God," in this place. But this was
   necessary, that the rabbinical accommodation of this place to Hezekiah
   might be retained.

   That this place, then, is spoken of Christ we have evinced, nor can it
   be waived without open perverting of the words; and he is here called
   "The mighty God," as was before declared.

   Grotius proceeds to apply the residue of this glorious name to
   Hezekiah: "The everlasting Father," or, as it is in the Vulgar Latin,
   "Pater futuri seculi." "In Hebræo non est futuri. Pater seculi est qui
   multos post se relicturus sit posteros, et in longum tempus;" -- "In
   the Hebrew the word future is not; the father of the age' is he who
   leaves many of his posterity behind him, and that for a long time."

   About the Vulgar Latin translation we do not contend. Of the meaning
   and use of the word vlm? I have spoken already. When it is applied to
   God, it signifies "eternity." But the word here is not vlm?, [360] but
   d?, properly "eternity," when applied to God: Ps. x. 16, "The Lord is
   King vlm vm?" -- "seculi et æternitatis, for ever and ever." Instances
   might be multiplied to this purpose. That this should be, "Hezekiah
   shall leave many children, and that for a long season," credat Apella.
   What sons he left, besides one, and him a wicked one for the most part
   of his days, is uncertain. Within one hundred and thirty years, or
   thereabout, his whole posterity was carried captive. How exceedingly
   unsuited this appellation is to him is evident. "The Father of
   eternity;" that is, one that leaves a son behind him, and a possibility
   for his posterity to continue in the condition wherein he was for one
   hundred and thirty years! Many such everlasting fathers may we find
   out. What in all this is peculiar to Hezekiah, that this should so
   emphatically be said to be his name.

   The next is, "Princeps Pacis;" -- "The Prince of Peace." "Princeps
   pacificus, et in pace victurus;" -- "A peaceable prince, and one that
   should live in peace."

   1. On how much better, more noble and glorious account this title
   belongs to Christ, is known. 2. The Prince of Peace is not only a
   peaceable prince, but the author, giver, procurer, establisher of
   peace. 3. Neither did Hezekiah reign in peace all his days. His kingdom
   was invaded, his fenced cities taken, and himself and chief city
   delivered by a miraculous slaughter of his enemies.

   "Of the increase of his government, and of peace no end;" which he
   reads according to the Vulgar Latin, "Multiplicabitur ejus imperiam, et
   pacis ejus non erit finis." Literally, "For the multiplying of his
   kingdom, and of peace no end." As to the first part, his exposition is,
   "Id est, durabit per annos 29;" -- "His kingdom should continue for
   twenty-nine years." Who would believe such gross darkness should cover
   the face of so learned a man? "Of the increase of his government there
   shall be no end;" that is, he shall reign nine and twenty years! This
   might almost twice as properly be spoken of his son Manasseh, who
   reigned fifty-five.

   And now let him that hath a mind to feed on such husks as these go on
   with his annotations in this place; I am weary of considering such
   trash. And let the pious reader tremble at the righteous judgment of
   God, giving up men trusting to their own learning and abilities,
   refusing to captivate their hearts to the obedience of the truth, to
   such foolish and childish imaginations, as men of common sense must
   needs abhor.

   It appears, then, that we have here a description of Jesus Christ, and
   of him only, and that the names here ascribed to him are proper to him,
   and declare who he was and is, even "The mighty God, The Prince of
   Peace," etc. Let us proceed with our catechists.

   In the next place they heap up sundry places, which they return slight
   answers unto; and yet to provide them in such manner as that they might
   be the easier dealt withal, they cut off parcels and expressions in the
   middle of sentences, and from the context, from whence the greatest
   evidence, as to the testimony they give in this matter, doth arise. I
   shall consider them apart as they are proposed:--

   Christ is called the Word of God, John i. 1, Rev. xix. 13. They say, --

   From hence, that Christ is called "The Word of God," a divine nature in
   Christ cannot be proved, yea, the contrary may be gathered; for seeing
   he is the Word of the one God, it is apparent that he is not that one
   God. But Jesus is therefore called the Word of God, because he expounds
   to us the whole will of God, as John there declares a little after,
   John i. 18; as he is also in the same sense said to be life and truth.
   [361]

   1. Christ is the Word of God. The Word, or ho Logos, is either
   prophorikos, or the word which outwardly is spoken of God; or
   endiathetos, his eternal, essential Word or Wisdom. Let our catechists
   prove another acceptation of the word in any place. That Christ is not
   the word spoken by God they will grant; for he was a person, that
   revealed to us the word of God. He is, then, God's eternal Word or
   Wisdom; and so, consequently, God. 2. Christ is so called the Word of
   God, John i. 1, as that he is in the same place said to be God. And our
   adversaries are indeed too impudent, whereas they say, "If he be the
   Word of the one God, he cannot be that one God," the Holy Ghost
   affirming the flat contrary, namely, that he was "The Word, and was
   with God, and was God;" that is, doubtless, the one true God, verses
   1-3. He was "with God" in his person as the Son; and he "was God" as to
   his nature. 3. Christ is not called the Word, John i. 1, upon the
   account of his actual revealing the word of God to us in his own person
   on the earth (which he did, verse 18), because he is called so in his
   everlasting residence with the Father before the world was, verse 1;
   nor is he so called on that account, Rev. xix. 13, it being applied to
   him in reference to the work of executing judgment on his enemies as a
   king, and not to his revealing the word of God as a prophet. So that
   notwithstanding this exception, this name of the "Word of God," applied
   to Christ, as in the places mentioned, proves him to have a divine
   nature, and to be God, blessed for ever.

   The next place is Col. i. 15, "Christ is the image of the invisible
   God." To which they say only, --

   The same may be said of this as of that foregoing. [362]

   But an image is either an essential image or accidental, -- a
   representation of a thing in the same substance with it, as a son is
   the image of his father, or a representation in some resemblance, like
   that of a picture. That Christ cannot be the latter is evident. Our
   catechists refer it to his office, not his person But, -- 1. It is the
   person of Christ that is described in that and the following verses,
   and not his office. 2. The title given to God, whose image he is, "The
   invisible God," will allow there be no image of him hut what is
   invisible; nor is there any reason of adding that epithet of God but to
   declare also the invisible spiritual nature of Christ, wherein he is
   like his Father. And the same is here intended with what is mentioned
   in the third place:--

   Heb. i. 3, "He is the express image of his person."

   This is to be understood that whatever God hath promised, he hath now
   really exhibited in Christ. [363]

   Well expounded! Christ is the character of his Father's person; that
   is, what God promised he exhibited in Christ! Would not any man admire
   these men's acumen and readiness to interpret the Scriptures? The words
   are part of the description of the person of the Son of God, "He is the
   brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person,
   upholding all things by the word of his power;" that is, he reveals the
   will of God! This the apostle had expressly affirmed, verse 2, in plain
   and familiar terms; that he should now repeat over the same thing
   again, in words so exceedingly insignificant of any such matter, is
   very strange. 2. The apostle streaks of the hypostasis of the Father,
   not of his will; of his subsistence, not his mind to be revealed. We do
   not deny that Christ doth represent his Father to us, and is to us the
   "express image of his person;" but, antecedently hereunto, we say he is
   so in himself. Grotius' corruption of this whole chapter was before
   dis. covered, and in part removed.

   John xiv. 9, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father," is next
   proposed. To which they say, --

   Neither can any divine nature be proved from hence, for this "seeing"
   cannot be spoken of the essence of God, which is invisible, but of the
   knowledge of the things that Christ did and spake. [364]

   Christ so speaks of his and his Father's oneness, whereby he that saw
   one saw both, as he describes it to be in the verse following, where he
   says "the Father is in him, and he in the Father." Now, that the Father
   is in him and he in the Father, and that he and the Father are one in
   nature and essence, hath been before sufficiently demonstrated. The
   seeing here intended is that of faith, whereby both Father and Son are
   seen unto believers.

   Col. ii. 9 is the last in this collection, "In whom dwelleth all the
   fulness of the Godhead bodily." To this they say, --

   That this word divinitas may signify the will of God. And seeing the
   apostle opposeth that speech not to persons, but to philosophy and the
   law, it is manifest that it is to be understood of the doctrine, and
   not of the person of Christ. Of this word "bodily" thou shalt hear
   afterward. [365]

   But, -- 1. It is not divinity but deity, not theotes but pleroma
   theotetos, that is here spoken of; and that not simply neither, but
   pleroma theotetos, "the fulness of the Godhead." 2. That theites, or
   pleroma theotetos, is ever taken for the will of God, they do not, they
   cannot prove. 3. How can it be said that the will of God katoikei
   somatikos, "doth dwell bodily" in any, or what can be the sense of that
   expression? Where they afterward interpret the word "bodily" I do not
   remember; when I meet with their exposition it shall be considered. 4.
   That the words are to be referred to the person of Christ, and not to
   his doctrine, is manifest, not only from the words themselves, that
   will not bear any such sense as whereunto they are wrested, but also
   from the context; for not only the whole order and series of words
   before and after do speak of the person of Christ (for "In him are hid
   all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," verse 3; "Him we receive,"
   verse 6; "In him we are built up," verse 7; "In him we are complete,"
   verse 10; "In him we are circumcised," verse 11; "With him we are
   buried," verse 12; "Together with him are we quickened," verse 13; and
   it was he that was crucified for us, verses 14, 15), but also the
   design of the Holy Ghost enforces this sense, it being to discover a
   fulness and sufficiency in Christ of all grace and wisdom, that men
   should not need to seek relief from either law or philosophy. The
   fulness of the Godhead inhabiting in the person of Christ
   substantially, he is God by nature. And of these places so far. The
   three following, of John xvii. 5, 1 Pet. i. 10, 11, John iii. 13, have
   been in their proper places already vindicated.

   Grotius interprets that of Col. ii. 9 according to the analogy of the
   faith of our catechists: "Christi doctrina non modo philosophiæ sed et
   Legi Mosis plurimum præstat." That pan to pleroma tes theotetos should
   be doctrina, and katoikei en Christo should make it "the doctrine of
   Christ," and somatikos should be no man knows what, is but a cross way
   of interpretation. And yet Augustine is quoted, with a saying from him
   to give countenance unto it; which makes me admire almost as much as at
   the interpretation itself. The words our annotator mentions are taken
   from his Epist. 57 ad Dardan., though he mentions it not. The reason
   will quickly appear to any one that shall consult the place; for
   notwithstanding the expression here cropped off from his discourse, he
   gives an interpretation of the words utterly contrary to what this
   learned man would here insinuate, and perfectly agreeing with that
   which we have now proposed!

   Our catechists proceed to the consideration of sundry places where
   Christ is called "The only Lord, the Lord of glory, the King of kings,
   the Lord of lords," -- all which being titles of the one true God,
   prove him to be so; -- and the first proposed is, "To us there is one
   Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him," 1 Cor. viii.
   6.

   A little to give light to our argument from hence, and that the
   strength of it may appear, some few observations concerning the context
   and the words themselves will be necessary:--

   1. Verse 5, the apostle, speaking of the heathens and their opinion of
   the Deity, says, "There be," that is, to them, in their apprehension,
   "gods many, and lords many;' that is, many supreme powers, who are gods
   and lords. The terms of "gods many, and lords many," are not expressive
   of several kinds of deities, but of the same. Whom they esteemed lords
   they esteemed gods, and so on the contrary. In opposition to this
   polytheism of theirs, he declares that Christians have but one God, one
   Lord; wherein if the apostle did not intend to assert one only God unto
   Christians, in the different persons of the Father and Son, he had not
   spoken in such an opposition as the adversative alla at the beginning
   of the words and the comparison instituted do require.

   2. That this "one Lord" of Christians is the only true God is manifest
   from Deut. vi. 4, "The Lord our God is one Lord." So the apostle here,
   "To us there is one Lord:" not many gods, as the heathens fancied; in
   opposition also to whose idolatry is that assertion of Moses. And so
   Thomas, in his confession, joins these two together, intending one and
   the same person, "My Lord and my God."

   3. Kurios, being put to signify God, is the word which the LXX. render
   Jehovah by, and so heis Kupios is that "only Jehovah."

   4. The attribution of the same works in this verse to Father and Son
   manifests them to be the same one God: "Of whom are all things, and we
   in him; ... by whom are all things, and we by him." These things being
   premised, what our catechists except to this testimony may be
   considered. Thus, then, they:--

   Hence a divine nature cannot be proved; for, -- 1. He doth manifestly
   difference him from the Father, whom we have taught above to be the
   only God by nature. 2. This that it says of him, that "by him are all
   things," shows him not to be God by nature, seeing, as hath been above
   declared, this particle "by" doth not signify the first, but the second
   cause; which can by no means be spoken of him who is God by nature. And
   though the Scriptures do sometimes say of the Father, "By him are all
   things," yet these words are to be taken otherwise of the Father than
   of the Son. It is manifest that this is said of the Father, because all
   mediate causes by which any thing is done are not from any other, but
   from himself, nor are they such as that he cannot work without them;
   but it is spoken of Christ, because by him another, namely, God,
   worketh all things, as it is expressly said, Eph. iii. 9. That I need
   not to remember, that the word "all things,"as was showed above, is to
   be referred to the subject-matter; which that it so appeareth hence,
   that the apostle dealeth of all those things which belong to the
   Christian people, as these two words "to us" and "Father" do declare.
   Whence it is proved that Christ is not simply and absolutely, but in
   some certain respect, called the "one Lord, by whom are all things."
   Wherefore his divine nature is not proved from hence. [366]

   It is very evident that they are much entangled with this testimony,
   which necessitates them to turn themselves into all manner of shapes,
   to try whether they can shift their bonds, and escape or no. Their
   several attempts to evade shall be considered in their order.

   1. It is true, Christ is differenced clearly from the Father as to his
   person, here spoken of; but that they have proved the Father to be the
   only God by nature, exclusively to the Son and Holy Ghost, is but a
   boasting before they put off their harness. It is true, the Father is
   said here to be the "one God;" which no more hinders the Son from being
   so too than the assertion that the Son is the "one Lord" denies the
   Father's being so also.

   2. That cavil at the word "by" hath been already considered and
   removed. It is enough for us to manifest that this assignation of the
   creation of all things to Christ by the expression of, "By him are all
   things," doth by no means depose him from the honour of principal
   efficient cause in that work, the same attribution being made to the
   Father in the same words. And to say, as our catechists do, that this
   expression is ascribed to the Father in such a sense, and not to
   Christ, is purely, without any pretence of proof, to beg the thing in
   question. Neither is that any thing to the purpose which is urged from
   Eph. iii. 9, for we confess that as Christ is equal with his Father as
   to his nature, wherein he is God, so as he is the Son in office, he was
   the servant of the Father, who accomplishes his own mind and will by
   him.

   3. The subject-matter in this place, as to the words under
   consideration, is the demonstration of the one God and Lord of
   Christians, asserted in opposition to the many gods and lords of the
   heathen, from the effects or works of that one God and Lord, "of him
   and by him are all things;" and this is the difference that God
   elsewhere puts between himself and idols, Jer. x. 10, 11. And if there
   be any such subject-matter as proves Christ not to be the one Lord
   absolutely, but in some respect, it proves also that the Father is not
   the one God absolutely, but in some respect only.

   4. The words "to us" and "Father" do one of them express the persons
   believing the doctrine proposed concerning the one true God and Lord,
   the other describes that one true God by that name whereby he revealed
   himself to those believers; neither of them at all enforcing the
   restriction mentioned.

   Christ, then, is absolutely the one Lord of Christians, who made all
   things; and so is by nature God, blessed for ever.

   I should but needlessly multiply words, particularly to animadvert on
   Grotius' annotations on this place. I do it only where he seems to add
   some new shifts to the interpretation of our adversaries, or varies
   from them in the way, though he agrees in the end; neither of which
   reasons occurring in this place, I shall not trouble the reader with
   the consideration of his words. By di hou ta pamta, to maintain his
   former expositions of the like kind, he will have all the things of the
   new creation only intended; but without colour or pretence of proof, or
   any thing to give light to such an exposition of the words.

   Our catechists next mention 1 Cor. ii. 8, "For had they known it, they
   would not have crucified the Lord of glory."

   Who is the Lord of glory, or God of glory, the Holy Ghost declares,
   Acts vii. 2, "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when
   he was in Mesopotamia;" and Ps. xxiv. 8, "Who is this King of glory?
   The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle." Christ,
   therefore, is this God; and, indeed, is intended in that psalm. But
   they say, --

   A divine nature cannot be proved from hence, seeing it treateth of him
   who was crucified, which cannot be said of a divine nature, but of a
   man; who is therefore called the "Lord of glory," that is, the glorious
   Lord, because he is crowned of God with glory and honour. [367]

   But, -- 1. Though the divine nature could not be crucified, yet he that
   had a divine nature might be and was crucified in the nature of a man,
   which he also had. Our catechists know they do but beg in these things,
   and would fain have us grant that because Christ had a human nature, he
   had not a divine. 2. He is called "The Lord of glory," as God is called
   "The God of glory;" and these terms are equivalent, as hath been
   showed. 3. He was the Lord of glory when the Jews crucified him, or
   else they had not crucified him who was the Lord of glory, but one that
   was to be so; for he was not crowned with glory and honour until after
   his crucifying.

   Grotius' annotation on this place is worth our observation, as having
   somewhat new and peculiar in it. "Kurion tes doxes. Eum quem Deus vult
   esse omnium judicem. Nam gloria Christi maxime illum diem respicit, 1
   Pet. iv. 13. Christus Kurios doxes, præfiguratus per arcam, quæ mlk
   hkvvr?, Ps. xxiv. 9." For the matter and substance of it, this is the
   same plea with that before mentioned: the additions only deserve our
   notice. 1. Christ is called "The Lord of glory, as God is called "The
   God of glory;" and that term is given him to testify that he is the God
   of glory. If his glory at the clay of judgment be intended, the Jews
   could not be said to crucify the Lord of glory, but him that was to be
   the Lord of glory at the end of the world. Our participation of
   Christ's glory is mentioned 1 Pet. iv. 13, not his obtaining of glory.
   He is essentially the Lord of glory; the manifestation whereof is
   various, and shall be eminent at the day of judgment. 2. That the ark
   is called mlk hkvvd?, is little less than blasphemy. It is he alone who
   is the Lord of hosts who is called "The Lord of glory," Ps. xxiv. 9.
   But this is another shift for the obtaining of the end designed, --
   namely, to give an instance where a creature is called "Jehovah," as
   that king of glory is; than which a more unhappy one could scarce be
   fixed on in the whole Scripture. The annotations of the learned man on
   that whole psalm are very scanty. His design is to refer it all to the
   story of David's bringing home the ark, 2 Sam. vi.. That it might be
   occasioned thereby I will not deny; that the ark is called "The King of
   glory" and "The Lord of hosts," and not he of whose presence and favour
   the ark was a testimony, no attempt of proof is offered. Neither, by
   the way, can I assent unto his interpretation of these words, "?Lift up
   your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors:' that
   is, Ye gates of Zion, made of cedar, that are made hanging down, and
   when they are opened, they are lifted up." Certainly something more
   sublime and glorious is intended.

   The process of our catechists is unto Rev. xvii. 14, xix. 16; in both
   which places Christ is called "The Lord of lords and King of kings."
   This also is expressly the name of God: 1 Tim. vi. 15, 16, "Who is the
   blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who
   only hath immortality, dwelling in the light," etc. To this they say:--

   In this testimony he is treated of who is the Lamb, who hath garments,
   who was killed, and redeemed us with his blood, as John evidently
   testifieth; which can by no means be referred to a divine nature, and
   therefore a divine nature cannot hence be proved. But all things that
   in these testimonies are attributed to Christ do argue that singular
   authority which God hath given unto Christ in those things that belong
   to the new covenant. [368]

   These are but drops; the shower is past. Because he who is the Lamb who
   was slain is King of kings and Lord of lords, we prove him to have
   another nature, in respect whereof he could be neither killed nor
   slain; therefore he is God, God only is so. And the answer is, "Because
   he was the Lamb he was killed and slain, therefore he is not God," --
   that is, he is not King of kings and Lord of lords; -- which the Holy
   Ghost, who gave him this name, win prove against them. 2. Our
   adversaries have nothing to except against this testimony, but that the
   King of kings and Lord of lords is not God; which they do not prove,
   nor labour to disprove our confirmation of it. 3. Kings and lords of
   the world are not of the things of the new covenant, so that Christ's
   absolute sovereignty over them is not of the grant which he hath of his
   Father as Mediator, but as he is God by nature.

   And so much for this collection concerning these several names of God
   attributed to Christ.

   What follows in the three questions and answers ensuing relates to the
   divine worship attributed to Christ in the Scriptures, though it be
   marvellous faintly urged by them. Some few texts are named, but so much
   as the intendment of our argument from them is not once mentioned. But
   because I must take up this elsewhere, namely, in answer to Mr Biddle,
   chap. x., I shall remit the consideration of what here they except to
   the proper place of it; where, God assisting, from the divine worship
   and invocation of Jesus Christ, I shall invincibly demonstrate his
   eternal power and Godhead.

   In the last place, they heap up together a number of testimonies, --
   each of which is sufficient to cast them down to the sides of the pit
   in the midst of their attempts against the eternal deity of the Son of
   God, -- and accommodate a slight general answer to them all. The places
   are worth the consideration; I shall only propose them, and then
   consider their answer.

   The first is Isa. viii. 13, 14, "Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself;
   and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he shall be
   for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence
   to both the houses of Israel." He that is to be for a rock of offence
   and a stone of stumbling is the Lord of hosts, whom we must sanctify in
   our hearts, and make him our dread and our fear. But this was Jesus
   Christ: Luke ii. 34, "This child is set for the fall and rising again
   of many in Israel." "As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a
   stumbling-stone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him
   shall not be ashamed," Rom. ix. 33. "The stone which the builders
   refused, ... a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence," 1 Pet. ii.
   7, 8. In all which places that prophecy is repeated. Christ, therefore,
   is the Lord of hosts, whom we are to sanctify in our heart, and to make
   him our dread and our fear.

   Isa. xlv. 22, 23, "I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by
   myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall
   not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall
   swear." He who is God, and none else, is God by nature. But now "we
   shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ. For it is written,
   As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue
   shall confess to God," Rom. xiv. 10, 11. It is the judgment-seat of
   Christ that men must appear before when they bow their knee to him, --
   that is, to him who is God, and none else.

   Isa. xli. 4, "I, Jehovah, the first, and with the last; I am he." Chap.
   xliv. 6, "I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no
   God." So chap. xlviii. 12. That this is spoken of Christ we have his
   own testimony, Rev. i. 17, "Fear not; I am the first and the last." He
   who is the first and the last, he is God, and there is none besides
   him.

   Zech. xii. 10, "I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplications: and
   they shall look upon me whom they have pierced." He that speaks is
   unquestionably Jehovah, the Lord of hosts So the whole context, so the
   promising of the Spirit in this verse, evinces But that Jesus Christ is
   here intended, that it is he who is spoken of, is evident, Rev. i. 7,
   "Every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him." He, then,
   is Jehovah, the Lord of hosts. "These things were done, that the
   scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. And
   again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they
   pierced," John xix. 36, 37. It is, as I said, beyond dispute that it is
   Jehovah, the only true God, that spake; and what he spoke of himself is
   fulfilled in Jesus Christ.

   Ps. lxviii. 17, 18, "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even
   thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy
   place. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
   thou hast received gifts for men; that the Lord God might dwell among
   them." This also is a glorious description of the triumphant majesty of
   God; and yet the God here intended is Jesus Christ: Eph. iv. 8-10,
   "Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
   captive, and gave gifts unto men. Now that he ascended, what is it but
   that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that
   descended is the same also that ascended."

   Grotius on both these places says that what is properly spoken of God
   is by Paul mystically applied to Christ; to the same purpose with what
   our catechists afterward insist on. That it is the same person who is
   intended in both places, and not that applied to one which was spoken
   of another (which is most evident in the context), he takes no notice.
   There being nothing of plea or argument in his annotations against our
   testimonies from hence, but only an endeavour to divert the meaning of
   the places to another sense, I shall not insist longer on them.

   But what say our catechists to all these, -- which are but some of the
   instances of this kind that might be given? Say they:--

   To all these it may be so answered as that it may appear that a divine
   nature in Christ cannot from them be proved: for those things which are
   spoken of God under the law may be spoken of Christ under the gospel,
   as also they are spoken, for another cause, -- namely, because of that
   eminent conjunction that is between God and Christ, on the account of
   dominion, power, and office; all which the scriptures of the New
   Testament do frequently witness that he received by gift from God. And
   if the Scripture delivers this of Moses, that he brought Israel out of
   Egypt, Exod. xxxii. 7, and that he was the redeemer of the people, Acts
   vii. 35, and of others the same things, that were evidently written of
   God, when neither Moses nor others had so near a conjunction with God
   as was between God and Christ, much more justly may those things which
   in the first respect are spoken of God be accommodated to Christ,
   because of the eminent and near conjunction that was between them.
   [369]

   And this is their defence, the answer they fix upon to all the
   testimonies recited; wherein how little truth or strength there is will
   quickly appear. 1. These scriptures perhaps may be answered thus or
   thus, as what will not the serpentine wits of men find out to wrest the
   word withal to their own destruction? but the question is, How ought
   they to be interpreted, and what is their sense and intendment? 2. We
   do not say that what is spoken of God under the law is accommodated to
   Christ under the gospel, but that the things instanced in, that were
   spoken of God, were then spoken of Christ as to his nature wherein he
   is God; which appears by the event, expounded in the books of the New
   Testament. The Scripture doth not say in the New Testament of Christ
   what was said in the Old of God, but evinces those things which were so
   spoken of God to have been spoken of Christ. So that, 3. The folly of
   that pretence, that what was spoken of God is referred to Christ upon
   the account of the conjunction mentioned, -- which, whatever it be, is
   a thing of nought in comparison of the distance that is between the
   Creator and a mere creature, -- is manifest; for let any one be in
   never so near conjunction with God, yet if he be not God, what is
   spoken of God, and where it is spoken of God, and denoting God only,
   cannot be spoken of him, nor, indeed, accommodated to him. 4. The
   instances of Moses are most remote from the business in hand. It is
   said of Moses that he brought the children of Israel out of Egypt; and
   so he did, as their chief leader and ruler, so that he was a redeemer
   to that people, as he was instrumental in the hand of God, working by
   his power and presence with him those mighty works which made way for
   their deliverance and redemption. But where is it said of Moses or any
   one else that he was God; that what God said of himself was said of
   Moses and accomplished in him? or where ever did Moses speak in the
   name of God, and say, "I, Jehovah, will do this and this, or be so and
   so, unto my people?" 5. It is true, men may be said to do in their
   place and kind of operation what God doth do, -- he as the principal
   efficient, they as the instrumental cause, -- and so may every other
   creature in the world, as the sun gives light and heat; but shall
   therefore that which God speaks in his own name of himself be so much
   as accommodated unto them? 6. The conjunction that is between God and
   Christ, according to our catechists, is but of love and favour on the
   part of God, and of obedience and dependence on the part of Christ; but
   this in the same kind, though not in the same degree, is between God
   and all believers, so that of them also what is spoken of God may be
   spoken.

   And thus, through the presence of God, have I gone through with the
   consideration of all the testimonies given in the Scripture of the
   deity of Christ which these catechists thought good to take notice of,
   with a full answer to their long chapter "De persona Christi." The
   learned reader knows how much all the arguments we insist on and the
   testimonies we produce in this cause might have been improved to a
   greater advantage of clearness and evidence, had I taken liberty to
   handle them as they naturally fall into several heads, from the
   demonstration of all the names and properties, all the works and laws,
   all the worship and honour of God, to be given and ascribed to Jesus
   Christ; but the work I had to do cast my endeavour in this business
   into that order and method wherein it is here presented to the reader.

   The conclusion of our catechists is a long harangue, wherein they
   labour to insinuate the prejudicialness of our doctrine to the true
   knowledge of Christ and the obtaining of salvation by him, with the
   certain foundation that is laid in theirs for the participation of all
   the benefits of the gospel. The only medium they fix upon for to gain
   both these ends by is this, that we deny Christ to be a true man, which
   they assert. That the first of these is notoriously false is known to
   all other men, and is acknowledged in their own consciences; of the
   truth of the latter elsewhere. He that had a perfect human nature, soul
   and body, with all the natural and essential properties of them both,
   he who was born so, lived so, died so, rose again so, was and is a
   perfect man; so that all the benefits that we do or may receive from
   Jesus Christ as a perfect man, like unto us in all things, sin only
   excepted, there is a way open for in this our confession of him. In the
   meantime, the great foundation of our faith, hope, and expectation,
   lies in this, that "he is the Son of the living God;" and so that "God
   redeemed his church with his own blood," he who was of the fathers
   "according to the flesh being God over all, blessed for ever:" which if
   he had not been, he could not have performed the work which for us he
   had to do. It is true, perhaps, as a mere man he might do all that our
   catechists acknowledge him to have done, and accomplish all that they
   expect from him; but for us, who flee to him as one that suffered for
   our sins, and made satisfaction to the justice of God for them, who
   wrought out a righteousness that is reckoned to all that believe, that
   quickens us when we are dead, and sends the Holy Ghost to dwell and
   abide in us, and is himself present with us, etc., it is impossible we
   should ever have the least consolation in our fleeing for refuge to him
   unless we had this grounded persuasion concerning his eternal power and
   Godhead. We cannot think he was made the Son of God and a God upon the
   account of what he did for us; but that being God, and the Son of God,
   herein was his love made manifest, that he was "made flesh," "took upon
   him the form of a servant," and became therein for us "obedient unto
   death, the death of the cross." Many, indeed, and inexpressible, are
   the encouragements unto faith and consolation in believing that we do
   receive from Christ's being made like to us, a perfect man, wherein he
   underwent what we were obnoxious unto, and whereby he knows how to be
   compassionate unto us; but that any sweetness can be hence derived unto
   any who do refuse to own the fountain whence all the streams of love
   and mercy that run in the human nature of Christ do flow, that we deny.
   Yea, that our adversaries in this business have any foundation for
   faith, love, or hope, or can have any acceptance with God or with Jesus
   Christ, but rather that they are cursed, on the one hand for robbing
   him of the glory of his deity, and on the other for putting their
   confidence in a man, we duly demonstrate from innumerable testimonies
   of Scripture. And for these men, the truth is, as they lay out the
   choicest of all their endeavours to prove him not to be God by nature,
   and so not at all (for a made god, a second-rank god, a deified man, is
   no God, the Lord our God being one, and the conceit of it brings in the
   polytheism of the heathen amongst the professors of the name of
   Christ), so they also deny him to be true man now he is in heaven, or
   to retain the nature of a man; and so, instead of a Christ that was God
   from eternity, made a man in one person unto eternity, they believe in
   a Christ who was a man, and is made a god, who never had the nature of
   God, and had then the nature of man, but hath lost it. This, Mr B.,
   after his masters, instructs his disciples in, in his Lesser Catechism,
   chap. x., namely, that although Christ rose with his fleshly body,
   wherein he was crucified, yet now he hath a spiritual body, not in its
   qualities, but substance, -- a body that hath neither flesh nor bones.
   What he hath done with his other body, where he laid it aside, or how
   he disposeth of it, he doth not declare.

   [353] "In quibus scripturis Christus vocatur Deus? -- Johan. i. 1, Et
   Verbum fuit Deus, et cap. xx. 28, Thomas ad Christum ait, Dominus meus
   et Deus meus; et Rom. ix. 5, apostolus scribit Christum Deum (esse)
   supra omnes benedicturn in secula."Quid his testimoniis effici potest?
   -- Naturam divinam in Christo ex iis demonstrari non posse, præter ea
   quæ superius allata sunt, hint manifestum est, quod in primo testimonio
   agatur de Verbo, quod Johannes testatur apud ilium Deum fuisse; in
   secundo, Thomas eum appellat Deum, in cujus pedibus et manibus,
   clavorum, in latere lanceæ vestigia deprehendit; et Paulus eum qui
   secundum carnem a patribus erat, Deum supra omnia benedictum vocat. Quæ
   omnia dici de eo qui natura Deus sit, nullo mode posse, planum est,
   etenim ex illo sequeretur duos esse Deos, quorum alter apud alterum
   fuerit. Hæc vero, vestigia vulnerum habere, eque patribus esse, hominis
   sunt prorsus, quæ ei, qui natura Deus sit, ascribi nimis absonum esset.
   Quod si illud distinctionis naturarum velum quis prætendat, jam
   superius illud amovimus, et docuimus hanc dis-tinctionem nullo modo
   posse sustineri."

   [354] "Ubi vero Scriptura testatur Christum cum Patre esse unum? --
   Johan x. 29-31, ubi Dominus ait, Pater, qui mihi (oves) dedit, major
   omnibus est; et nemo eas rapere potest e manibus Patris mei. Ego et
   Pater unum sumus."Qua ratione respondes ad id testimonium? -- Ex eo,
   quod dicatur Christus esse cum Patre unum, efiiei non posse esse unum
   cum co nature, verba Christi, quæ ad Patrem de discipulis habuit,
   demonstrant: Johan. xvii. 11, Pater sancte, serve illos in nomine tuo,
   ut sint unum, quemadmodum et nos unum sumus; et paulo inferius, ver.
   22, Ego gloriam, quam dedisti mihi, dedi illis; ut sint unum,
   quemadmodum nos unum surnus. Quod veto Christus sit unum cum Patre, hoc
   aut de voluntate aut de potentia in salutis nostræ ratione accipi
   debet. Unde naturam divinam non probari ex eodem loco constat ubi
   Christus air, Pattern omnibus esse majorem, ac proinde etiam ipso
   Domino, quemadmodum idem Dominus expresse fatetur, et quod eas oves ei
   dederit, Johan. xiv. 28."

   [355] "Filium autem Dei viventis, Filium Dei proprium et unigenitum
   esse Christum, ubi habetur? -- De hoc Matt. xvi. 16, legimus, ubi
   Petrus ait, Tu es Christus, Filius Dei viventis; et Rom. viii. 32, ubi
   apostolus ait, Qui (Deus) proprio Filio, non pepercit, verum cum
   propter nos tradidit; et Johan. iii. 16, Sic Deus dilexit mundum, ut
   Filium suum genitum daret; et ver. 18, Nomen unigeniti Filii
   Dei."Quomodo vero ad hæc loca respondetur? -- Ex iis omnibus attributis
   Christi hullo modo probari posse naturam ejus divinam; nam quod ad
   primum attinet, notissimum est Petrum fateri, quod Filius hominis sit
   Christus, et Filius Dei viventis, quem constat divinam naturam, qualem
   illi comminiscuntur, non habuisse. Præterea, testatur Scriptura de
   aliis hominibus quod sint filii Dei viventis, ut ex Hosea, Rom. ix. 26,
   Et erit loco ejus, ubi eis dictum est, Non populus meus (estis) vos,
   illic vocabuntur filii Dei viventis. Quod vero secundum et tertium
   locum attinet, in his legimus proprium et unigenitum Dei Filium in
   mortem traditum, quod eo qui natura Deus sit, dici non potest. Imo vero
   ex eo quod Christus Dei Filius sit, apparet Deum illum non esse,
   alioquin sibi ipsi Filius esset. Causa vero cur Christo ista attributa
   competant hæc est, quod inter onmes Dei filios et præcipuus sit et Deo
   charissimus, quemadmodum Isaac, quia Abahamo charissimus et hæres
   exstitit, unigenitus vocatus est, Heb. xi. 17, licet fratrem Ismaelem
   habuerit; et Solomon unigenitus coram matre sua, licet plures ex eadem
   matre fratres fuerint, 1 Chron. iii. 1-6, etc., Prov. iv. 3."

   [356] "Quæ scriptura eum vocat primogenitum omnis creaturæ? -- Col. i.
   15."Quid ad eam respondes? -- Neque hinc naturam divinam Christum
   habere exsculpi posse, etenim cum Christus primogenitus omnis creaturæ
   sit, eum unum e numero creaturarum esse oportere necesse est; ea enim
   in Scripturis vis est primogeniti, ut primogenitum unum ex eorum
   genere, quorum primogenitus est, esse necesse sit, Col. i. 18; Rom.
   viii. 29; Rev. i. 5. Ut vero unus e rebus conditis creationis veteris
   existat Dominus Jesus, nec adversarii quidem concedent, nisi Ariani
   esse velint. Unum igitur esse e novæ creationis genere Dominum Jesum
   concedant oportet. Unde non solum divina Christi natura effici non
   potest, verum etiam quod nunam divinam naturam Christus habeat firmiter
   conficitur. Quod vero eo nomine vocatur ab apostolo Jesus, eo fit, quod
   tempore et præstantia res onmes novæ creationis longe antecedat."

   [357] "Ubi vero scriptura eum omnia quæ Pater habeat habere asserit? --
   John xvi. 15, Christus sit, Omnia quæ Pater habet mea sunt; et infra
   capite xvii. 10, Mea omnia tua sunt, et tua mea."Quid tu ad hæc? -- Vox
   omnia, ad subjectam materiam ut superius aliquoties demonstravimus fere
   semper refertur; quare ex ejusmodi locis non potest ullo modo quod
   volunt effici. Materia vero subjecta, cap. xvi., est, id nimirum, quod
   Spiritus Sanctus apostolis ad Christi regnum spectans revelaturus erat;
   et xvii. cap. constat apertissime agi de discipulis ipsius Jesu quos
   ipsi Deus dederat, unde eos etiam suos vocat. Præterea, cum quicquid
   Christus habeat, habcat Patris dono, non autem a seipso, hinc apparet,
   ipsum divinam naturam habere hullo modo posse, cum natura Deus omnia a
   seipso habeat."

   [358] "At quæ scriptura Christum Patrem æternitatis vocat? -- Isa. ix.
   6."Tu vero quid ad hæc? -- Ex eo naturam divinam probari non posse, cum
   certain ob causam Pater æternitatis Christus sit vocatus, ex ipsis
   verbis ibidem paulo superius expressis videre est. Mirum veto est
   adversarios hunc locum, ubi agitur de Patre æterno, ad Filium referre,
   quem constat secundum cos ipsos Patrem non esse. Pater vero æternitatis
   aut futuri seculi propterea dictus est Christus, quod sit princeps et
   autor vitæ æternæ, quæ futura est."

   [359] Vide Pet. Gal. lib. iii. cap. xix.; Raymun. Martin. iii. p. dist.
   1, cap. ix.

   [360] Ps. xlviii. 14, ix. 6, 7, etc.

   [361] "Ex eo quod Verbum Dei sit Christus doceri divina in Christo
   natura non potest, imo adversum potius colligitur, cum enim ipsius
   unius Dei Verbum sit, apparet eum non esse ipsum unum Deum. Quod etiam
   ad singula hæc testimonia simul responderi potest. Verbum vero, vel
   Sermo Dei Jesus ideo nuncupatur, quod omnem Dei voluntatem nobis
   exposuerit, ut ibidem Johannes inferius exposuit, Johan. i. 18.
   Quemadmodum etiam eodem sensu et vita et veritas dicitur."

   [362] "Hoc idem dici potest de eo, quod imago Dei inconspicui vocatur."

   [363] "Quod vero character hypostaseos ejus dictus sit, hoc intelligi
   debet: Deus quicquid nobis promisit, jam reipsa in eo exhibuisse.'?"

   [364] "Quod vero attinet ad dictum Domini Jesu, Qui me videt videt
   Patrem, nequehinc naturam divinam probari certum cuique esse potest,
   cum ea ratio videndi non possit de essentia Dei accipi, quæ invisibilis
   sit prorsus, verum de cognitione eorum, quæ dixit et fecit Christus."

   [365] "Nec illis denique verbia, quod plenitudo divinitatis in eo
   habitat corporaliter, probatur natura divina. Primum enim, vox hæc
   divinitas designate potest voluntatem Dei. Eamque orationem cum
   apostolus opponat non personis, sed philosophiæ et legi, hinc
   perspicuum est, eam de doctrina Domini Jesu non de persona accipi. De
   hac vero voce corporaliter, quid ea notet, inferius suo loco audies."

   [366] "Ex eo quod Christum apostolus Dominum suum vocet, natura divina
   effici nequit; nam eum primo manitfeste ab illo Patre, quem ibidem Deum
   unum fatetur, secernit, quum solum natura Deum esse superius docuimua
   Deinde, hoc ipsum quod de eo dicit, omnia per ipsum, eum natura Deum
   esse non ostendit, cum, ut superius demonstratum est, hac particula per
   non primam verum secundam causam designari constet, quod de eo qui
   natura Deus est dici nullo mode petest. Et licet de Patre Scriptura
   interdum loquatur, Per eum omnia, aliter tamen hæc de Patre quam de
   Christo accipiuntur. De Patre enim hæc ideo dici constat, quod omnes
   causæ mediæ per quas fit aliquid, non aliunde sint, nisi ab ipso, nec
   sint ejusmodi, ut sine iis ille agere non possit; de Christo vero
   dicuntur, quod per eum alius quis, nempe Deus omnia operetur, ut Eph.
   iii. 9 expresse habetur. Ne commemorandum mihi sit verbum omnia (uti
   superius ostensum est) ad subjectam materiam referri; quod ita habere
   inde apparet, quod apostolus agit de iis omnibus rebus quæ ad populum
   Christianum pertinent, ut duo hæc verba demonstrant, nobis, et Pater.
   Unde efficitur Christum non simpliciter et absolute, verum certa de
   causa vocatum Dominum unum, per quem omnia Quare hinc natura divina non
   probatur."

   [367] "Cum in eo agatur de eo qui crueifixus sit, apparet ex eo naturam
   divinam non probari, cum de hac illud dici nequeat, verum de heroine,
   qui ideo Dominus gloriæ dicitur, hoc est, Dominus gloriosus, quod a Deo
   gloria et honore coronatus sit."

   [368] "In tertio testimonio, cum agatur de eo qui Agnus est, et qui
   vestimenta ha Revelation bet quem et occisum, et sanguine suo nos
   redimisse, apertissime idem Johannes fatetur, quæ referri ad divinam
   naturam nulla ratione poassunt, apparet eo naturam divinam Christi
   astrui non posse. Omnia veto quæ hic Christo in iis testimoniis
   tribuuntur, singularem ipsius potestatem quam Deus Christo in iis quæ
   ad novum foedus pertinent, dedit, arguunt."

   [369] "Ad omnia ita responderi potest, ut appareat nullo modo ex iis
   effici divinam in Christo esse naturam; etenim aliam ob causam ea quæ
   de Deo dicta sunt sub lege, dici potuerunt de Christo sub evangelio,
   quemadmodum et dicta sunt, nimirum propter illam summam quæ inter Deum
   et Christum est, ratione imperii, potestatis, atque muneris,
   conjunctionem, quæ onmia illum Dei dono consecutum esse scripturæ Novi
   Testamenti passim testantur. Quod si Scriptura ea tradit de Mose, eum
   Israelem ex Ægypto eduxisse, Exod. xxxii. 7, et quod redempter illius
   populi fuerit, Acts vii. 35, et de aliis idem quod de ipso Deo
   apertissime scriptum erat, cum nec Moses neque alli tantam cum Deo
   conjunctionem haberent, quanta inter Deum et Christum intercessit,
   multo justius hæc quæ de Deo primo respectu dicta sunt, Christo
   accommodari possunt, propter summam illam et arctissimam inter Deum et
   Christum conjunctionem."

     __________________________________________________________________

  Examination.

   The fifth chapter of our catechist is concerning the Holy Ghost, for
   reducing of whom into the order and rank of creatures Mr Biddle hath
   formerly taken great pains; [370] following therein the Macedonians of
   old, and leaving his new masters the Socinians, who deny him his
   personality, and leave him to be only the efficacy or energy of the
   power of God. The design is the same in both; the means used to bring
   it about differ. The Socinians, not able to answer the testimonies
   proving him to be God, to be no creature, do therefore deny his
   personality. [371] Mr B., being not able to stand before the clear
   evidence of his personality, denies his deity. What he hath done in
   this chapter I shall consider; what he hath elsewhere done hath already
   met with a detection from another hand.

   "Q. How many Holy Spirits of Christians are there? -- A. One Spirit,'
   Eph. iv. 4."

   I must take leave to put one question to Mr B, that we may the better
   know the mind and meaning of his; and that is, what he means by the
   "Holy Spirits of Christians"? If he intend that Spirit which they
   worship, invocate, believe, and are baptized into his name, who
   quickens and sanctifies them, and from whom they have their supplies of
   grace, it is true there is but one only Spirit of Christians, as is
   evident, Eph. iv. 4; and this Spirit is "God, blessed for ever;" nor
   can any be called that one Spirit of Christians but he that is so. But
   if by the "Holy Spirits of Christians" he intend created spiritual
   beings, sent out from God for the good of Christians, of those that
   believe, there are then an innumerable company of holy spirits of
   believers; for all the angels are "ministering spirits, sent forth to
   minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation," Heb. i. 14. So that
   by this one testimony, that there is but one Holy Spirit of Christians,
   that Holy Spirit is exempted from the number of all created spirits,
   and reckoned as the object of their worship with the "one God" and one
   Lord, Eph. iv. 4-6; when yet they worship the Lord their God alone, and
   him only do they serve, Matt. iv. 10.

   His second question is, "Wherein consists the prerogative of that Holy
   Spirit above other spirits? -- A. 1 Cor. ii. 10, 11."

   The prerogative of that Holy Spirit of whom we speak is that of God
   above his creatures, -- prerogative of an infinite, eternal,
   self-subsisting being. Yea, and that this is indeed his prerogative we
   need not seek for proof beyond that testimony here produced by Mr B.
   (though to another purpose) in answer to his question. He that
   "searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God," is God. To "search
   all things" is the same with knowing all things; so the apostle
   interprets it in the next verse, "The things of God knoweth no man, but
   the Spirit of God." To know all things is to be omniscient; but he that
   is omniscient is God. His angels he charged with folly. Omniscience is
   an essential attribute of God; and therefore Socinus, in his
   disputation with Franken, durst not allow Christ to be omniscient, lest
   he should also grant him to be infinite in essence. [372] Again, he
   that searches or knows ta bathe tou Theou, the "deep things of God," is
   God. None can know the deep things of an infinite wisdom and
   understanding but he that is infinite. All creatures are excluded from
   an acquaintance with the deep things of God, but only as he voluntarily
   revealeth them: Rom. xi. 34, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or
   who hath been his counsellors" that is, no creature hath so been. Theon
   oudeis heorake popote, John i. 18 Now the Spirit doth not know the deep
   things of God by his voluntary revelation of them; for as the spirit of
   a man knows the things of a man, so doth the Spirit of God know the
   things of God. This is not because they are revealed to the spirit of a
   man, but because that is the principle of operation in a man, and is
   conscious to all its own actions and affairs. And so it is with the
   Spirit of God: being God, and having the same understanding, and will,
   and power, with God the Father and Son, as the spirit of a man knows
   the things of a man, so doth he the things of God. Thus in the
   beginning of this, as in the close of the last chapter, Mr B. hath
   provided sufficiently for his own conviction and scattering of all his
   paralogisms and sophistical insinuations, running through them both.

   The design of this present chapter being to pursue what Mr B. hath some
   years since publicly undertaken, namely, to disprove the deity of the
   Holy Ghost, -- his aim here being to divert the thoughts of his
   catechumens from an apprehension thereof, by his proposal and answer of
   such questions as serve to his design, pretending to deliver the
   doctrine concerning the Holy Ghost from the Scripture, and not once
   producing any of those texts which are most usually insisted on for the
   confirmation of his deity (with what Christian candour and ingenuity is
   easily discovered), -- I shall briefly, from the Scripture, in the
   first place establish the truth concerning the eternal deity of the
   person of the Holy Ghost, and then consider his questions in their
   order, so far as shall be judged meet or necessary.

   I shall not go forth unto any long discourse on this subject, some
   plain testimonies of Scripture will evince the truth we contend for,
   being the heads of as many arguments, if any one shall be pleased to
   make use of them in that way.

   First, then, the Spirit created, formed, and adorned this world, and is
   therefore God: "He that made all things is God," Heb. iii. 4. "By the
   word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the
   Spirit of his mouth," Ps. xxxiii. 6. "By his Spirit hath he garnished
   the heavens," Job xxvi. 13. "The Spirit of God hath made me, and the
   breath of the Almighty hath given me life," chap. xxxiii. 4; Ps. civ.
   30. He that makes the heavens and garnisheth them, he that maketh man
   and giveth him life, is God. So in the beginning mrchpht?, motabat se,
   moved himself, as a dove warming its young, as he afterward appeared in
   the form of a dove. And hence that which is ascribed unto God
   absolutely in one place is in another ascribed to the Spirit
   absolutely: as, Exod. iv. 15, Num. xii. 8, what it is affirmed that God
   doth, will do, or did, is affirmed of the Spirit, Acts i. 16, xxviii.
   25: so Num. xiv. 22, Deut. vi. 16, what is said of God is affirmed of
   the Spirit, Isa. lxiii. 10, Acts vii. 51: so also Deut. xxxii. 12,
   compared with Isa. lxiii. 14. Innumerable other instances of the same
   kind might be added.

   Secondly, He regenerates us. "Except we be born of water and of the
   Spirit, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God," John iii. 5; 2 Thess.
   ii. 13; 1 Pet. i. 2. He also "searcheth all things, yea, the deep
   things of God," as was before observed, 1 Cor. ii. 10, 11. From him is
   our illumination, Eph. i. 17, 18; 2 Cor. iii. 18. John xiv. 26, "The
   Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, he shall teach you all things."
   Chap. xvi. 13, "The Spirit of truth will guide you into all truth."
   "The Holy Ghost shall teach you," Luke xii. 12. And he foretelleth
   "things to come," John xvi. 13, 1 Tim. iv. 1; which is a property of
   God, whereby he will be known from all false gods, Isa. xli. 22, 23,
   etc. And he is in some of these places expressly called God, as also 1
   Cor. xii. 5, 6, compared with verse 11; and he is immense, who dwells
   in all believers.

   Thirdly, He dwelleth in us, as God in a temple, Rom. viii. 9, 1 Cor.
   iii. 16; thereby sanctifying us, chap. vi. 11; comforting us, John xvi.
   7; and helping our infirmities, Rom. viii. 26; mortifying our sins,
   chap. viii. 13; creating in us Christian graces, Gal. v. 22, 23; yea,
   he is the author of all grace, as is evident in that promise made of
   his presence with the Messiah, Isa. xi. 2. I say, with the Messiah, for
   of him only are those words to be understood; to which purpose I cannot
   but add the words of an old friar, to the shame of some amongst us who
   should know more, or be more Christian in their expositions of
   Scripture. Saith he, speaking of this place, "Note that in innumerable
   places of the Talmud this is expounded of the Messiah, and never of any
   other, by any one who is of any authority among the Hebrews. Wherefore
   it is evident that some amongst us, too much Judaizing, do err, whilst
   they fear not to expound this literally of Josiah. But that this is to
   be understood of the Messiah only is showed by Rabbi Solomon, who
   expounds it of him, and not of Josiah; which, according to his way, he
   would never have done, if, without the injury, of his Talmud and
   Targum, and the prejudice of all his predecessors, he could have
   expounded it otherwise." [373] So far he.

   It is not a little strange that some Christians should venture farther
   in perverting the testimonies of Scripture concerning the Messiah than
   the Jews dare to do.

   4. He makes and appoints to himself and his service ministers of the
   church, Acts xiii. 2, giving unto them powers, and working various and
   wonderful works, as he pleaseth, 1 Cor. xii. 8-11.

   5. He is sinned against, and so offended with sin that the sin against
   him shall never be forgiven, Matt. xii. 31; though it be not against
   his person, but some especial grace and dispensation of his.

   6. He is the object of divine worship, [374] we being baptized into his
   name, as that of the Father and Son, Matt. xxviii. 19. And grace is
   prayed for from him as from Father and Son, 2 Cor. xiii. 14; Rev. i. 4,
   5; Rom. x. 14. He is to be head of churches, Rev. ii. 3; but God will
   not give this glory to another, Isa. xlii. 8. Also, he hath the name of
   God given him, Isa. vi. 8, 9, compared with Acts xxviii. 25, 26; and
   Isa. lxiii. 13, 14, with Ps. lxxviii. 41, 52; 2 Sam. xxiii. 2, 3; Acts
   v. 3, 4.

   7. And the attributes of God are ascribed to him, as, -- (1.) Ubiquity,
   or omnipresence, Ps. cxxxix. 7; 1 Cor. iii. 16. (2.) Omniscience, 1
   Cor. ii. 10; John xvi. 13. His omnipotency and eternity are both
   manifest from the creation.

   8. To all this, in a word, it may be added that he is a person, the
   denial whereof is the only kresphugeton of the Socinians. They
   acknowledge that if he be a person, he is God. But, (1.) He is a person
   who hath a name, and in whose name something is done, as we are said to
   be baptized in the name of the Holy Ghost, Matt. xxviii. 19. And, (2.)
   He is conjoined with the other divine persons as one of them, 2 Cor.
   xiii. 14; Rev. i. 4, 5; Matt. xxviii. 19. (3.) He hath an
   understanding, 1 Cor. ii. 11; and a will, chap. xii. 11. (4.) To him
   are speaking and words ascribed, and such actions as are peculiar to
   persons, Acts xiii. 2, xx. 28, etc.

   What remains of this chapter will be of a brief and easy despatch. The
   next question is, "Whence is the Holy Ghost sent? -- A. 1 Pet. i. 12,
   Down from heaven.'?"

   1. This advantageth not at all Mr B.'s design against the Holy Ghost,
   to prove him not to be God, that he is "sent down from heaven;" whereby
   he supposeth that his coming from one place to another is intimated,
   seeing he supposes God to be so in heaven, yea, in some certain place
   of heaven, as at the same time not to be elsewhere, so that if ever he
   be in the earth he must come down from heaven.

   2. Nor is there any thing in his being sent prejudicial to the
   prerogative of his divine being; for he who is God, equal in nature to
   the Father and Son, yet, in respect of the order of that dispensation
   that these three who are in heaven, who are also one, 1 John v. 7, have
   engaged in for the salvation of men, may be sent of the Father and the
   Son, having the execution of that work, which they respectively concur
   in, in an eminent manner to him committed.

   3. Wherever the Spirit is said to descend from heaven, it is to be
   understood according to the analogy of what we have already spoken
   concerning the presence of God in heaven, with his looking and going
   down from thence; which I shall not repeat again. Essentially he is
   everywhere, Ps. cxxxix. 7.

   4. In that place of Peter alleged by Mr B., not the person of the
   Spirit, but his gifts on the apostles, and his operations in them,
   whose great and visible foundations were laid on the day of Pentecost,
   Acts ii., are intended.

   The two next questions leading only to an expression of the sending of
   the Holy Ghost by the Father and the Son, though Mr B.'s Christians
   differ about the interpretation of the places produced for the proof
   thereof, and there lie no small argument and evidence of the deity of
   Christ in his sending of the Holy Ghost as the Father sends him, yet
   there being an agreement in the expressions themselves, I shall not
   insist upon them. He proceeds:-- "Q. Had Jesus Christ always the power
   to send the Holy Ghost, or did he obtain it at a certain time? -- A.
   Acts ii. 32, 33; John vii. 39."

   1. The intendment of this query is, to conclude from some certain
   respect and manner of sending the Holy Ghost to the thing itself, --
   from the sending him in a visible, glorious, plentiful, eminent manner,
   [375] as to the effusion of his gifts and graces, to the sending of him
   absolutely; which methinks a Master of Arts should know to be a
   sophistical way of arguing. 2. It endeavours, also, from the exercise
   of power to conclude to the receiving of the power itself; and that not
   the absolute exercise of it neither, but in some certain respect, as
   was spoken. 3. This, then, is that which Mr B. concludes: "Because
   Christ, when he was exalted, or when he ascended into heaven, had the
   accomplishment of the promise actually, in the sending forth of the
   Spirit in that abundant and plentiful manner which was prophesied of by
   Joel, chap. ii. 28-31, therefore he then first received power to send
   the Spirit:" which, 4. By the testimony of Christ himself is false, and
   not the sense of the Holy Ghost in the places mentioned, seeing that
   before his ascension he breathed on his disciples, and bade them
   receive the Holy Ghost, John xx. 22. Nay, 5. That he had the power of
   sending the Holy Ghost, and did actually send him, not only before his
   ascension and exaltation, but also before his incarnation, is expressly
   affirmed, 1 Pet. i. 11. The Spirit that was in the prophets of old was
   the "Spirit of Christ," and sent by him; as was that Spirit by which he
   preached in the days of the old disobedient world: which places have
   been formerly vindicated at large. So that, 6. As that place, Acts ii.
   32, 33, is there expounded to be concerning the plentiful effusion of
   the gifts of the Holy Spirit in the times of the gospel, according to
   the prophecy of Joel, so also is that of John vii. 39, it being
   positively affirmed as to the thing itself that he gave the Holy Ghost
   before his exaltation, though not in that abundant manner as afterward;
   and so neither of them concludes any thing as to the time of Christ's
   receiving power to send the Spirit; which, upon the supposition of such
   a work as for the accomplishment whereof it was necessary the Holy
   Ghost should be sent, he had from eternity.

   About the next question we shall not contend. It is:-- "Q. What were
   the general benefits accruing to Christians by the Holy Ghost?"
   whereunto sundry texts of Scripture that make mention of the Holy
   Ghost, his graces, and gifts, are subjoined. Upon the whole I have only
   some few things to animadvert:--

   1. If by the words "general benefits" he limits the receiving of those
   benefits of the Holy Ghost to any certain time (as suppose the time of
   his first plentiful effusion, upon the ascension of Jesus Christ, and
   the preaching of the gospel to all nations thereupon), as it is a
   sacrilegious conception, robbing believers of after ages to the end of
   the world of all the fruits of the efficacy of the Spirit, without
   which they can neither enjoy communion with God in this life nor ever
   be brought to an eternal fruition of him, so it is most false, and
   contrary to the express prayer of our Saviour, desiring the same things
   for them who should believe on his name to the end of the world as he
   did for those who conversed with him in the days of his flesh. But I
   will suppose this is not his intention, because it would plainly deny
   that there are any Christians in the worm (which yet was the opinion of
   some of his friends heretofore [376] ), for "if we have not the Spirit
   of Christ we are none of his," Rom. viii. 9.

   2. The things enumerated may be called "general benefits," because they
   are common to all believers as to the substance, essence, or being of
   them, though in respect of their degrees they are communicated
   variously to the several individuals, the same Spirit dividing to every
   one as he will, 1 Cor. xii. 11. They are so general to them all that
   every particular believer enjoys them all.

   3. The enumeration here given us is very far and remote from being
   complete, there being only some few fruits of the Spirit and privileges
   which we receive by our receiving of him recounted, and that in a very
   confused manner, one thing being added after another without any order
   or coherence at all. Yea, of the benefits we receive by the Spirit, of
   the graces he works in us, of the helps he affords us, of that joy and
   consolation he imparts unto us, of the daily assistances we receive
   from him, of the might of his power put forth in us, of the efficacy of
   his operations, the constancy of his presence, the privileges by him
   imparted, there is not by any in this life a full account to be given.
   To insist on particulars is not my present task; I have also in part
   done it elsewhere. [377]

   4. I desire Mr B. seriously to consider whether even the things which
   he thinks good to mention may possibly be ascribed to a mere creature,
   or that all believers are by such an one "baptized into one body," or
   that we "are all made to drink into one Spirit," etc. But of these
   things before. Unto this he adds: "Q. What are the special benefits
   accruing to the apostles by the Holy Ghost? what saith Christ to them
   hereof? -- A. John xv. 26, xvi. 13."

   Besides the graces of the Spirit, which the apostles, as believers,
   received in a plentiful manner, they had also his presence by his
   extraordinary gifts, to fit them for that whole extraordinary work
   whereunto of him they were called: for as by his authority they were
   separated to the work, and were to perform it unto him, Acts xiii. 2,
   so whatever work they were to perform, either as apostles or as penmen
   of the scripture of the New Testament, they had suitable gifts bestowed
   on them by him, 1 Cor. xii., -- inspiration from him suitable to their
   work; the Scripture being of inspiration from God, because the holy men
   that wrote it were inspired or moved by the Holy Ghost, 2 Pet. i. 21, 2
   Tim. iii. 16, 17. [378] And as this Holy Ghost, who is God, working all
   in all, divideth of his gifts as he will, 1 Cor. xii. 6, 11, and giveth
   all gifts whatever to the church that it doth enjoy, so did he in an
   especial manner with the apostles.

   Now, our Saviour, Christ, being to leave the world, giving gracious
   promises to his disciples, he considered them under a twofold capacity
   or condition:-- 1. Of believers, of such as followed him and believed
   in him; wherein their estate was common with that of all them who were
   to believe on him to the end of the world, John xvii. 20. 2. Of
   apostles, and of such as he intended to employ in that great work of
   planting his church in the world, and propagating his gospel to the
   ends of it. Under both these considerations doth he promise the Spirit
   to his disciples, John xiv. 26, xv. 26, xvi. 7, 13, praying his Father
   for the accomplishment of those promises, chap. xvii.; -- that as
   believers they might be kept in the course of their obedience to the
   end (in which regard he made those promises no less to us than to
   them); and that as apostles they might be furnished for their work,
   preserved, and made prosperous therein. Of this latter sort some
   passages in the verses here mentioned seem to be, and may have a
   peculiar regard thereunto, and yet in their substance they are of the
   first kind, and are made good to all believers. Neither is there any
   more said concerning the teaching and guidance of the Spirit into the
   truth in John xv. 26, xvi. 13, than is said in 1 John ii. 20, 27, where
   it is expressly assigned to all believers. Of that unction and teaching
   of the Spirit, of his preserving us in all truth needful for our
   communion with God, of his bringing to mind what Christ had spoken, for
   our consolation and establishment, with efficacy and power (things, I
   fear, despised by Mr B.), this is not a season to treat.

   That which follows concerns the order and way of procedure insisted on
   by the Son and Holy Ghost in carrying on the work of our salvation and
   propagation of the gospel, whose sovereign fountain is in the bosom of
   the Father. His query is, "Q. Should the Holy Ghost lead them into all
   truth, as speaking of himself, and imparting of his own fulness? what
   saith Christ concerning him? -- A. John xvi. 13, 14."

   1. The Scripture proposeth the Holy Ghost, in the communication of his
   gifts and graces, under a double consideration:-- (1.) Absolutely, as
   he is God himself; and so he speaketh of himself, and the churches are
   commanded to attend to what he so saith, Rev. ii. 29. And he imparts of
   his own fulness, "the self-same Spirit dividing to every man severally
   as he will," 1 Cor. xii. 11. And in this sense, what the prophets say
   in the Old Testament, "The word of the Lord," and "Thus saith the
   Lord," in the New they are said to speak by the Spirit, Matt. xxii. 43;
   Acts i. 16; 2 Pet. i. 21. (2.) Relatively, and that both in respect of
   subsistence and operation, as to the great work of saving sinners by
   Jesus Christ. And as in the first of these senses he is not of himself,
   being the Spirit of the Father and the Son, proceeding from them both,
   so neither doth he speak of himself, but according to what he receiveth
   of the Father and the Son. 2. Our Saviour, Christ, says here, "He shall
   not speak of himself;' but he nowhere says, "He shall not impart of his
   own fulness," which is Mr B.'s addition To "speak of himself" shows the
   original authority of him that speaks, whereby he speaks to be in
   himself; which, as to the words and works pointed to, is not in the
   Holy Ghost personally considered, and as in this dispensation. But to
   impart of his own fulness, is to give out of that which is eminently in
   himself; which the Holy Ghost doth, as hath been shown. 3. Christ, in
   the words insisted on, comforting his disciples with the promise of the
   presence of his Spirit when he should be bodily absent from them,
   acquaints them also with the works that he should do when he came to
   them and upon them, in that clear, eminent, and abundant manner which
   he had promised; -- which is not any new work, nor any other than what
   he had already acquainted them with, nor the accomplishment of any
   thing but what he had laid the foundation of; yea, that all the mercy,
   grace, light, guidance, direction, consolation, peace, joy, gifts, that
   he should communicate to them and bless them withal, should be no other
   but what were procured and purchased for them by himself. These things
   is the Spirit said to hear and speak, to receive and communicate, as
   being the proper purchase and inheritance of another; and in so doing
   to glorify him whose they are, in that peculiar sense and manner. All
   that discourse which we have of the mission and sending of the Holy
   Ghost, and his proceeding or coming forth from the Father and Son for
   the ends specified, John xiv. 26, xv. 26, xvi. 7, 13, concerns not at
   all the eternal procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father and Son,
   as to his distinct personality and subsistence, but belongs to that
   economy, or dispensation, or ministry, that the whole Trinity
   proceedeth in for the accomplishment of the work of our salvation.

   The last query, by the heap of scriptures that is gathered in answer to
   it, seems to have most weight laid upon it; but it is indeed, of all
   the rest, most weakly sophistical. The words of it are, "Q. Do men
   receive the Holy Ghost while they are of the world and in their natural
   condition, to the end that they may become the children of God, may
   receive the word, may believe, may repent, may obey Christ; or after
   they are become the children of God, have received the word, do
   believe, do repent, do obey Christi" The answer is as above. To the
   same purpose is that of the Racovian Catechism:--

   Ques. Is there not need of the internal gift of the Spirit, that we may
   believe the gospel?

   Ans. By no means; for we do not read in the Scripture that that gift is
   conferred on any but him that believes the gospel. [379]

   Remove the ambiguity of that expression, "Believe the gospel," and
   these two questions perfectly fall in together. It may, then, be taken
   either for believing the doctrine of the gospel in opposition to the
   law, and in this sense it is not here inquired after; or for the power
   of believing in the subject, and in that sense it is here denied.

   1. Now, the design of this question is, to deny the effectual operation
   of the Holy Ghost for and in the conversion, regeneration, and
   sanctification of the elect, and to vindicate the whole work of faith,
   holiness, quickening, etc., to ourselves. The way designed for the
   proof and establishment of this insinuation consists in producing
   sundry testimonies wherein it is affirmed that those who do believe and
   are the children of God do receive the Spirit for other ends and
   purposes than those here enumerated. The sum of his argument is this:
   "If they who do believe and are the children of God do receive the
   Spirit of God for their adoption, and the carrying on of the work of
   their sanctification, with the supply of new grace, and the
   confirmation and enlargement of what they have received, with joy,
   consolation, and peace, with other gifts that are necessary for any
   work or employment that they are called unto, then the Holy Spirit doth
   not quicken or regenerate them, nor work faith in them, nor make them
   the children of God, nor implant them into Christ." Now, when Mr B.
   proves this consequence, I will confess him to be master of one art
   which he never learned at Oxford, unless it were his business to learn
   what he was taught to avoid.

   2. But Mr B. hath one fetch of his skill more in this question. He asks
   whether men do receive the Holy Ghost when they are of the world; and
   for a confutation of any such apprehension produceth testimonies of
   Scripture that the world cannot receive the Holy Ghost, nor the natural
   man the things of God. But who told this gentleman that we say men
   whilst they are in and of the world do receive the Spirit of God, or
   the things of the Spirit, in the Scripture sense or use of that word
   "receiving?" The expression is metaphorical, yet always, in the case of
   the things of the gospel, denoting the acting of faith in them who are
   said to "receive" any thing from God. Now, if this gentleman could
   persuade us that we say that we receive the Spirit by faith, to the end
   that we may have faith, he might as easily lead us about whither he
   pleased as the Philistines did Samson when they had put out his eyes. A
   little, then, to instruct this catechist: I desire him to take notice,
   that properly the Spirit is received by faith to the ends and purposes
   by him mentioned, with many such others as might be added; but yet,
   before men's being enabled to receive it, that Spirit, by his power and
   the efficacy of his grace, quickeneth, regenerateth, and worketh faith
   in their hearts. In brief, the Spirit is considered and promised either
   as a Spirit of regeneration, with all the concomitants and essential
   consequents thereof, or as a Spirit of adoption, with the consequents
   thereof. In the first sense he works in men in order of nature
   antecedent to their believing, faith being a fruit of the Spirit; in
   the latter, and for the ends and purposes thereof, he is received by
   faith, and given in order of nature upon believing.

   3. That the world cannot receive the Spirit, nor the natural man the
   things of God, is from hence, that the Spirit hath not wrought in them
   that which is necessary to enable them thereunto; which is evident from
   what is affirmed of the impotency of the natural man as to his
   receiving the things of God: for if the reason why he cannot receive
   the things of God is because he is a natural man, then, unless there be
   some other power than what is in himself to translate him from that
   condition, it is impossible that he who is a natural man should ever be
   otherwise, for he can only alter that condition by that which he cannot
   do. But, --

   4. That the Spirit is given for and doth work regeneration and faith in
   men, I shall not now insist on the many testimonies whereby it is
   usually and invincibly confirmed. There is no one testimony given to
   our utter impotency to convert or regenerate ourselves, to believe,
   repent, and turn to God; no promise of the covenant to give a new
   heart, new obedience through Christ; no assertion of the grace of God
   and the efficacy of his power, which is exalted in the vocation and
   conversion of sinners, -- but sufficiently evinces the truth thereof.
   That one eminent instance shall close our consideration of this
   chapter, which we have Tit. iii. 5, 6, "Not by works of righteousness
   which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the
   washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed
   on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour."

   Of the first head made by men professing the religion of Jesus Christ
   against the deity of the Spirit, attempting to rank him among the works
   of his own hand; of the peculiar espousing of an enmity against him by
   Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, from whom the ensuing
   pneumatomachoi took their name; of the novel inventions of Faustus
   Socinus and his followers, denying the personality of the Spirit,
   making him to be nothing but the efficacy of the power of God, or the
   power of God, -- this is no place to treat. Besides, the truth is,
   until they will speak clearly what they mean by the "Spirit of God,"
   and so assert something, as well as deny, they may justly be neglected.
   They tell us it is virtus Dei; but whether that virtus be substantia or
   accidens they will not tell us. It is, they say, potentia Dei. This we
   confess; but we say he is not potentia energetike, but hupostatike, and
   that because we prove him to be God.

   What, then, hath been spoken of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I shall
   shut up with that distich of Greg. Naz. Sanct. Spir. lib. iii.:--

Chapter XVI.

   Of salvation by Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Mr Biddle's sixth chapter considered.

   This is a short chapter, and will speedily receive its consideration.
   That Christ is a Saviour, and that he is so called in Scripture, is
   confessed on all hands Mr Biddle's masters were the first who directly
   called into question amongst Christians on what account principally he
   is so called. Of his faith in this business and theirs we have the sum,
   with the reasons of it, in the book of their great apostle, "De Jesu
   Christo Servatore." This book is answered throughout with good success
   by Sibrandus Lubbertus; the nerves of it cut by Grotius, "De
   Satisfactione Christi;" and the reply of Crellius thereunto thoroughly
   removed by Essenius, in his "Triumphus Crucis." The whole argumentative
   part of it, summed up into five heads by Michael Gitichius, is answered
   by Ludovicus Lucius, and that answer vindicated from the reply of
   Gitichius. And generally those who have written upon the satisfaction
   of Christ have looked upon that book as the main master-piece of the
   adversaries, and have made it their business to remove its sophistry
   and unmask its pretensions.

   Mr B. is very slight and overly in this business, being not able, in
   the method of procedure imposed on himself, so much as to deliver his
   mind significantly as to what he does intend. The denial and rejection
   of the satisfaction and merit of Christ is that which the man intends,
   as is evident from his preface, where he denies them, name and thing.
   This he attempts partly in this chapter, partly in that concerning the
   death of Christ, and also in that of justification. In this he would
   attempt the notion of salvation, and refer it only to deliverance from
   death by a glorious resurrection. Some brief animadversions may
   possibly rectify the man's mistakes. His first question we pass, as a
   principle in the terms of it on all sides confessed, namely, that
   "Christ is our Lord and Saviour." His second is:--

   Ques. Is Christ our Saviour originally and of himself, or because he
   was given, exalted, and raised up by another to be a Saviour?

   Ans. Acts iv. 12, v. 31, xiii. 28.

   The intendment of this query is to pursue the former insinuations of
   our catechist against the deity of Christ, as though his appointment to
   his office of mediation were inconsistent with his divine nature; the
   vanity of which pretence hath been sufficiently already discovered. In
   brief, Christ is considered either absolutely with respect to his
   divine nature and person, as he is God in himself, and so he is a
   Saviour originally of himself; for "as for our Redeemer, the Lord of
   hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel," Isa. xlvii. 4. "Thy Maker
   is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the
   Holy One of Israel," chap. liv. 5. In this sense was Christ a Saviour
   originally and of himself. But as he took flesh, to accomplish the work
   of our redemption by tasting death for us, though his own merciful and
   gracious will did concur therein, yet was he eminently designed to that
   work and given, by his Father, in love and mercy, contriving the work
   of our salvation. And this latter is mentioned not only in the places
   cited by our catechist, but also in a hundred more, and yet not one of
   them lying in the least subserviency to Mr B.'s design. His last query
   is:--

   Q. How do the saints expect to be saved by Christ?

   A. Rom. v. 10; Phil. iii. 20, 21.

   The intendment of this question must be to answer the general proposal,
   in what sense Christ is our Saviour, and how his people are saved by
   him. Now, however that be true in itself which is here asserted, and is
   the exurgency of the question and answer as connected, the saints
   expecting salvation by Christ in the complete accomplishment of it by
   his power in heaven, yet as here proposed to give an account of the
   whole sense wherein Christ is our Saviour, [it] is most false and
   deceitful. Christ is a Saviour principally as he was promised, and came
   to "save his people from their sins," -- whence he had his name of
   Jesus, or a Saviour, Matt. i. 21, -- and that by his death, Heb. ii.
   14, 15, or laying down his life a ransom for us, Matt. xx. 28, and
   giving himself a price of redemption for us, 1 Tim. ii. 6, "in whom we
   have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins," Eph. i. 7,
   so saving or delivering us from the wrath that is to come, 1 Thess. i.
   10. The salvation which we have by Christ, which this chapter in title
   pretends to discover, is from sin, the world, Satan, death, wrath,
   curse, the law, bearing of us unto acceptation with God, peace,
   reconciliation, and glory. But that the doctrines before mentioned,
   without which these things cannot once be apprehended, may be obscured
   or lost, are these wholly omitted. Of the sense of Rom. v. 10, and what
   is there intended by the "life of Christ," I shall farther treat when I
   come to speak about justification, and of the whole business under our
   consideration of the death of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter XVII.

   Of the mediation of Christ.

   In his seventh chapter he proposeth two questions in general about the
   mediation of Christ, answering, first, that he is a "mediator," from 1
   Tim. ii. 5; second, that he is the "mediator of the new covenant," Heb.
   viii. 6, xii. 24. But as to his work of mediation, what it is, wherein
   it doth consist, on what account principally Christ is called our
   mediator, whether he be a mediator with God for us, as well as a
   mediator with us for God, and how he carries on that work, -- wherein
   he knows the difference between us and his masters about this matter
   doth lie, -- he speaks not one word, nor gives any occasion to me to
   enter into the consideration of it. What I suppose necessary to offer
   to this head, I shall do in the ensuing discourse of the death of
   Christ, the ends thereof, and the satisfaction thereby.

   And therefore I shall hereunto add his ninth chapter also, which is
   concerning remission of sins by Jesus Christ. The difference between
   his masters and us being about the meritorious and procuring cause of
   remission of sins by. Christ, which here he mentions not, what is
   farther to be added thereabout will fall in also under the
   consideration of the death of Christ, and our justification thereby.

   His first question is altogether out of question, namely, "Who shall
   have remission of sins by Christ?" It is granted all, and only,
   believers. "He that believeth shall be saved; and he that believeth not
   shall be damned," Mark xvi. 16. "To as many as receive him, power is
   given to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
   name," John i. 12.

   To his next question an answer may be given that will suit that
   following also, which is the whole of this chapter. The question is,
   "Doth not Christ forgive sins? -- A. Christ forgave you,' Col. iii.
   13."

   That Christ forgives sins is taken for granted; and yet forgiveness of
   sin is the supremest act of sovereign, divine power that God exerciseth
   in the world. Now, Christ may be considered two ways:-- 1. Absolutely,
   as "God over all, blessed for ever." So he forgave sins by his own
   original authority and power, as the lawgiver who is able to save and
   to destroy. 2. As Mediator, God and man; and so his power was delegated
   to him by God the Father, as himself speaks, Matt. xxviii. 18, "All
   power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;" and chap. ix. 6, he
   saith that he had "power on earth to forgive sins," -- that is, given
   unto him. Now, forgiveness of sins is either authoritative or
   declarative. The latter Christ delegated to his apostles and all their
   successors in the work of preaching the gospel, and it is such a power
   as a mere man may be invested withal. That forgiveness of sins which we
   term "authoritative," being an act of sovereign, divine power,
   exercised about the law and persons concerned therein, may be said to
   be given to Christ two ways:-- (1.) As to the possession of it; and so
   he hath it from his Father as God, as he hath his nature, essence, and
   life from him. Whence, whatever works the Father doth, he doth
   likewise, -- quicken as he quickens, pardon as he pardons, -- as hath
   been declared. (2.) As to the execution of it, for such an end and
   purpose as the carrying on of the work of mediation, committed to him;
   and so it is given him in commission from the Father, who sent him into
   the world to do his will; and in this sense had he, the Son of man,
   power to forgive sins whilst he was on the earth. And to Mr B.'s ninth
   chapter this may suffice.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter XVIII.

   Of Christ's prophetical office.

   The eighth chapter in Mr Biddle is of Christ's prophetical office, or
   his entrance into a dealing with Christ in respect of his offices, as
   he hath done with him in respect of his person already.

   His first question is, --

   Ques. Is not Christ dignified, as with the title of mediator, so also
   with that of prophet?

   Ans. Acts iii. 20, 22.

   1. Mr B. tells us, chap. iv., that Christ is dignified with the title
   of God, though he be not so; and here that he is dignified with the
   title of a prophet, but leaves it at large whether he were so indeed or
   no. We are resolved in the case. The first promise made of him by God
   to Adam was of him generally as a mediator, particularly as a priest,
   as he was to break the head of Satan by the bruising of his own heel;
   the next solemn renovation of it to Abraham was of him as king, taking
   all nations to be his inheritance; and the third by Moses, after the
   giving of the law, as a prophet to teach and instruct his redeemed
   people, Gen. iii. 15, xii. 2, 3, Deut. xviii. 18. And a prophet he is,
   the great prophet of his church; not only dignified with that title,
   but so he is indeed.

   2. But says Mr B., "He is dignified with the title of a prophet as well
   as of mediator," -- as though his being a prophet were
   contradistinguished from his being a mediator. Christ's teaching of his
   people is part of the mediation he hath undertaken. All that he doth on
   their part in offering gifts and sacrifices to God for them, all that
   he doth on the part of God towards them by instructing and ruling of
   them, he doth as he is the mediator between God and man, the surety of
   the covenant. He is not, then, a mediator and a prophet, but he who is
   the mediator is the high priest and prophet of his church. Nor are
   there any acts that he exerciseth on the one or other of these accounts
   but they are all acts of his mediation, and of him as a mediator. Mr
   B., indeed, tells us not what he understands by the mediation of
   Christ. His masters so describe it as to make it all one with his
   prophetical office, and nothing else; which makes me somewhat to wonder
   why this man seems to distinguish between them.

   3. Many more notions of Mr B.'s masters are here omitted; as, that
   Christ was not the prophet of his people under the old testament,
   though by his Spirit he preached even to those that were disobedient in
   the days of Noah, and it was the Spirit of Christ that was in all the
   prophets of old, whereby God instructed his church, 1 Pet. iii. 19, 20,
   i. 11; -- that he is a prophet only because he hath given unto us a new
   law, though he promise effectually to open blind eyes, and to send his
   Spirit to teach us and to lead us into all truth, giving us
   understanding that we may know him that is true, Isa. lxi. 1; Luke iv.
   18; John xvi. 7-13; 1 John v. 20. But he lays dirt enough in our way,
   so that we shall not need farther to rake into the dunghill.

   4. I should not have thought that Mr B. could have taken advantage for
   his end and purpose from the place of Scripture he mentions, Acts iii.
   20, 22, "Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord
   your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me," but that I
   find him in his next query repeating that expression, "Like unto me,"
   and wresting of it to be the foundation of a conceit plainly jocular.
   Christ was like to Moses as he was a prophet, and like to Aaron as he
   was a priest, and like to David as he was a king; that is, he was
   represented and typified by all these, and had that likeness to them
   which the antitype (as the thing typified is usually but improperly
   called) hath to the type: but that therefore he must not only be like
   them in the general office wherein the correspondency doth Consist, but
   also in all the particular concernments of the office as by them
   administered, is to confound the type and the antitype (or rather thing
   typified.) Nor do the words used, either by Moses, Deut. xviii. 18, or
   by Peter, Acts iii. 22, intimate any such similitude or likeness
   between Christ and Moses as should extend to such particulars as are
   afterward intimated. The words of Peter are, "God shall raise you up a
   prophet, hos eme," rather "as he raised up me," than "like unto me,"
   not the least similitude being intimated between them but in this, that
   they were both prophets, and were both to be hearkened unto. And so the
   word used by God to Moses, kmvk?, "sicut te" ("a prophet as thou art"),
   doth import, "I will raise up one that shall be a prophet as thou art a
   prophet." The likeness is only in the office. For such a similitude as
   should give the least occasion to Mr B.'s following figments there is
   no colour. And so the whole foundation being rooted up, the tottering
   superstruction will easily fall to the ground. But then to proceed:--

   Q. Forasmuch as Christ was to be a prophet like unto Moses, and Moses
   had the privilege above other prophets that God made not himself known
   to him in a vision, nor spake to him in a dream, but face to face, as a
   man speaketh to his friend, and showed to him the similitude of the
   Lord, Exod. xxxiii. 11, Num. xii. 6-8, can you tell any passage of
   Scripture which intimateth that Christ did see God before the discharge
   of his prophetical office?

   A. John vi. 45, 46, "Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he
   which is from God, he hath seen the Father."

   1. This passage is indeed very pretty, whether the principles or the
   inferences of it are considered.

   The principles of it are sundry:-- (1.) That God hath a bodily shape
   and similitude, face and hands, and the like corporeal properties;
   [380] (2.) That Moses saw the face of God as the face of a man; [381]
   (3.) That Christ was in all things like Moses, so that what Moses did
   he must do also. Therefore, (1.) Christ did see the face of God as a
   man; (2.) He did it before he entered on his prophetical office;
   whereunto add, (3.) The.proof of all, "No man hath seen the Father,
   save he which is from God." That is, Christ only saw the face of God,
   and no man else, when the ground of the whole fiction is that Moses saw
   it before him!

   2. Of the bodily shape of God, and of Moses seeing his face, I have
   already spoken that which Mr B. will not take out of his way. Of
   Christ's being like Moses something also hath now been delivered.

   That which, Exod. xxxiii. 11, in the Hebrew is pnym 'lpnym?, panim el
   panim, the LXX. have rendered enopios enopio, -- that is, "præsens
   præsenti," "as one present with him;" and the Chaldee paraphrast,
   "verbum ad verbum," -- that is, God dealt with him kindly and
   familiarly, not with astonishing terror, and gave him an intimate
   acquaintance with his mind and will. And the same expression is used
   concerning God's speaking to all the people, Deut. v. 4; of whom yet it
   is expressly said that they saw no likeness at all, chap. iv. 12. [382]

   If from the likeness mentioned there must be a sameness asserted unto
   the particular attendancies of the discharge of that office, then
   Christ must divide the sea, lift up a brazen serpent, and die in a
   mountain, and be buried by God where no man could ever know. Moses,
   indeed, enjoyed an eminency of revelation above other prophets, which
   is called his conversing with God as a friend, and beholding him face
   to face, but even in that wherein he is exalted above all others, he is
   infinitely short of the great Prophet of his church: for Moses, indeed,
   as a servant was faithful in all the house of God, but this man is over
   his own house; whose house we are, Heb. iii. 5, 6.

   3. This figment is for ever and utterly everted by the Holy Ghost, John
   i. 17, 18, where he expressly urges a dissimilitude between Moses and
   the only-begotten Son in that particular wherein this gentleman would
   have the likeness to consist "Herein," says Mr B., "is Christ like to
   Moses, that as Moses saw God face to face, so he saw God face to face."
   "No," saith the Holy Ghost; "the law, indeed, was given by Moses, but
   no man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in
   the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him." It is true that it is
   said of Moses that "God spake to him face to face," -- that is, in a
   more clear and familiar manner than he did to other prophets, -- though
   he told him plainly that he should not, or could not, see his face,
   Exod. xxxiii. 18-23, though he gave him some lower manifestations of
   his glory: so that notwithstanding the revelations made to him, "no man
   hath seen God at any time, but the only-begotten Son." He who is of the
   same nature and essence with the Father, and is in his bosom love, he
   hath seen him, John vi. 46; and in this doth Moses, being a man only,
   come infinitely short of the only-begotten Son, in that he could never
   see God, which He did: which is also asserted in the place of Scripture
   cited by Mr B.

   4. To lay this axe, then, also to the root of Mr B.'s tree, to cut it
   down for the fire: The foundation of Christ's prophetical office, as to
   his knowledge of the will of his Father, which he was to reveal, doth
   not consist in his being "taken up into heaven," and there being taught
   the will of God in his human nature, but in that he was the
   "only-begotten Son of the Father," who eternally knew him and his whole
   will and mind, and, in the dispensation which he undertook, revealed
   him and his mind, according as it was appointed to him. In respect,
   indeed, of his human nature, wherein he declared and preached the will
   of God, he was taught of God, being filled with wisdom and
   understanding by the Spirit, whereby he was anointed for that purpose;
   but as the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, he always saw
   him, knew him, and revealed him, Luke iv. 18; Isa. lxi. 1; Heb. i. 9.

   I shall only add, that this fancy of Mr B. and the rest of the
   Socinians (Socinianism being, indeed, a kind of modest and subtile
   Mohammedanism [383] ), of Christ's seeing God, as did Moses, seems to
   be taken from, or taken up to comply with, the Alcoran, where the same
   is affirmed of Mohammed. So Beidavi on these words of, the Alcoran, "Et
   sunt ex iis quibuscum locutus est ipse Deus." Saith he, "Est hic Moses;
   aut juxta alios Moses et Mahumed, super quibus Pax; Mosi Deus locutus
   est ea nocte, qua in exstasi quasi fuit in monte Sinai. Mahumedi vero
   locutus est illa nocte, qua scalis coelo admotis, angelos vidit
   ascendere, tunc enim vix jactum duarum sagittarum ab eo fuit." How near
   Moses came is not expressed, but Mohammed came within two bow-shots of
   him! How near the Socinian Christ came I know not, nor doth Mr B.
   inform us.

   But yet as Mr B. eats his word as to Moses, and after he had affirmed
   that he saw the face of God, says he only saw the face of an angel, so
   do the Mohammedans also as to the vision of their prophet, who tell us
   that indeed he was not able to see an angel in his own proper shape, as
   Socinus says we cannot see a spiritual body, though Mr B. thinks that
   we may see God's right hand and his left. But of this you have a
   notable story in Kessæus. Saith he, "They report of the prophet that on
   a certain day, or once upon a time, he said to Gabriel, O Gabriel, I
   desire to see thee in the form of thy great shape or figure, wherein
   God created thee. Gabriel said to him, O beloved of God, my shape is
   very terrible; no man can see it, and so not thou, but he will fall
   into a swoon. Mohammed answered, Although it be so, yet I would see
   thee in a bigger shape. Gabriel therefore answered, O beloved of God,
   where dost thou desire to see me? Mohammed answered, Without the city
   of Mecca, in the stony village. Says Gabriel, That village will not
   hold me. Therefore answered Mohammed, Let it be in mount Orphath. That
   is a larger and fitter place, says Gabriel. Away, therefore, went
   Mohammed to mount Orphath, and, behold, Gabriel with a great noise
   covered the whole horizon with his shape; which when the prophet saw,
   he fell upon the earth in a swoon. When, therefore, Gabriel, on whom be
   peace, had returned to his former shape, he came to the prophet, and
   embracing and kissing him, said to him, Fear not, O beloved of God, I
   am thy brother Gabriel. The prophet answers, Thou speakest truly, O my
   brother Gabriel; I could never have thought that any creature of God
   had had such a figure or shape. Gabriel answered, O beloved of God,
   what wouldst thou say if thou sawest the shape of the angel Europhil?"
   [384]

   They who know any thing of the Mohammedan forgeries and abominations,
   in applying things spoken of in the Scripture to their great impostor,
   will quickly perceive the composition of this fiction from what is
   spoken of Moses and Daniel. This lying knave, it seems, was of Mr B.'s
   mind, that it was not God indeed, but an angel, that appeared to Moses
   on mount Sinai; and thence is this tale, which came to pass "once upon
   a time." He proceeds:--

   Q. From whence doth it appear that Christ, like Moses, heard from God
   the things that he spake?

   A. John viii. 26, 28, 40, xiv. 10.

   All the difficulty of this question ariseth from these words, "Like
   Moses;" and the sense by Mr B. put upon them, -- how falsely, holy
   inconsistently with himself, with what perverting of the Scripture, --
   hath been declared. The scriptures in the answer affirm only that
   Christ "heard and was taught of the Father;" which is not at all
   denied, but only the modus that Mr B. would impose upon the words is
   rejected. Christ "heard of the Father," [385] who taught him, as his
   servant in the work of mediation, by his Spirit, wherewith he was
   anointed; but it is his "going into heaven" to hear a lesson with his
   bodily ears which Mr B. aims at, and labours under the next query to
   prove, -- how unsuccessfully shall briefly be demonstrated. Saith he,
   --

   Q. Can you farther cite any passage to prove that Christ as a man
   ascended into heaven, and was there, and came from God out of heaven,
   before he showed himself to the world and discharged his prophetical
   office, so that the talking of Moses with God, in the person of an
   angel bearing the name of God, was but a shadow of Christ's talking
   with God?

   A. John iii. 13, 30-32, vi. 29, 32, 33, 38, 41, 42, 51, 57, 58, 62,
   viii. 29, 42, xiii. 1, 3, xvi. 27-30, xvii. 8.

   We are come now to the head of this affair, to that which has been
   aimed at all along in the former queries The sum is: "Christ until the
   time of his baptism was ignorant of the mind and will of God, and knew
   not what he was to do or to declare to the world, nor what he came into
   the world for, at least only in general; but then when he was led into
   the wilderness to be tempted, he was rapt up into heaven, [386] and
   there God instructed him in his mind and will, made him to know the
   message that he came to deliver, gave him the law that he was to
   promulge, and so sent him down again to the earth to preach it." Though
   the Scripture says that he knew the will of God, by being his
   "only-begotten Son, full of grace and truth," and that he was "full of
   the Holy Ghost" when he went to the wilderness, being by him "anointed
   to preach the gospel;" though at his solemn entrance so to do "the
   heavens were opened, and the Spirit of God descended on him in the form
   of a dove," God giving solemn testimony to him and charge to "hear
   him;" [387] yet, because Mr B.'s masters are not able to answer the
   testimonies of Scripture for the divine nature of Christ, which affirm
   that he was in heaven before his incarnation, and came down to his work
   by incarnation, this figment is set on foot, to the unspeakable
   dishonour of the Son of God. Before I proceed farther in the
   examination of this invention and detection of its falsehood, that it
   may appear that Mr B. made not this discovery himself by his impartial
   study of the Scripture (as he reports), it may not be amiss to inquire
   after the mind of them in this business whose assistance Mr B. has in
   some measure made use of.

   The Racovian Catechism gives us almost the very same question and
   answer:--

   Q. Whence is it manifest that Christ revealed the will of God perfectly
   unto us?

   A. Hence, because Jesus himself was in a most perfect manner taught it
   of God in heaven, and was sent from heaven magnificently for the
   publishing of it to men, and did perfectly declare it to them.

   Q. But where is it written that Christ was in heaven, and was sent from
   heaven?

   A. John vi. 38, -- [388]

   -- and so do they proceed with the places of Scripture here cited by Mr
   B. The same Smalcius spends one whole chapter in his book of the
   Divinity of Christ, whose title is, "De Initiatione Christi ad Munus
   Propheticum," to declare and prove this thing, that Christ was so taken
   up into heaven, and there taught the mind of God, Smalc. de Divin. Jes.
   Christ. cap. iv.; only in this he seems to be at variance with Mr B.,
   that he denies that Moses saw the face of God, which this man makes the
   ground of affirming that Christ did so. But here Mr B. is at variance
   also with himself in the end of the last question, intimating that
   Moses saw only the face of an angel that bare the name of God; which
   now serves his turn as the other did before. Ostorodius, in his
   Institutions, cap. xvi., pursues the same business with vehemency, as
   the manner of the man was: but Smalcius is the man who boasts himself
   to have first made the discovery; and so he did, as far as I can find,
   or at least he was the first that fixed the time of this rapture to be
   when he was in the wilderness. And saith he, "Hoc mysterium nobis a Deo
   per sacras literas revelatum esse plurimum gaudemus," Idem ibid. And,
   of all his companions, this man lays most weight on this invention. His
   eighth chapter, in the refutation of Martinus Smiglecius, de Verbi
   Incarnationis Natura, is spent in the pursuit of it; so also is a good
   part of his book against Ravenspergerus. Socinus himself ventures at
   this business, but so faintly and slightly as I suppose in all his
   writings there is not any thing to be found wherein he is less
   dogmatical; his discourse of it is in his first answer to the Parænesis
   of Volanus, pp. 38-40. One while he says the words are to be taken
   metaphorically; then, that Christ was in heaven in his mind and
   meditation; and at last, it may be, "was taken into heaven," as Paul
   was. [389]

   To return to our catechists and to the thing itself, the reader may
   take of it this brief account:--

   1. There is, indeed, in the New Testament abundant mention of our
   Saviour's coming down from heaven, of his coming forth from God, which
   in what sense it is spoken hath been fully before declared; but of his
   being taken up into heaven after his incarnation before his death, and
   being there taught the mind of God and the gospel which he was to
   preach, there is not one word nor syllable. Can it be supposed that,
   whereas so many lesser things are not only taken notice of, but also to
   the full expressed, with all their circumstances, this, which,
   according to the hypothesis of them with whom we have to do, is of such
   importance to the confirmation of his doctrine, and, upon a supposition
   of his being a mere man, eminently suited to the honour of his ministry
   above all the miracles that he wrought, [should not have been
   mentioned,] -- that he and all his followers should be utterly silent
   therein; that when his doctrine was decried for novelty and folly, and
   whatever is evil and contemptible, that none of the apostles in its
   vindication, none of the ancients against the Pagans, should once make
   use of this defensative, that Christ was taken up into heaven, and
   there instructed in the mind of God? Let one word, testimony, or
   expression, be produced to this purpose, that Christ was taken up into
   heaven to be instructed in the mind of God before his entrance upon his
   office, and let our adversaries take the cause. If not, let this story
   be kept in the old golden legend, as a match for any it contains.

   2. There was no cause of this rapture or taking of Christ into heaven.
   That which is assigned, that there he might be taught the gospel, helps
   not in any measure; for the Scripture not only assigns other causes of
   his acquaintance with the mind and will of God, -- namely, his oneness
   with the Father, being his only-begotten Son, his Word and Wisdom, as
   also (in respect of his condescension to the office of mediation) his
   being anointed with the fulness of the Spirit, as was promised and
   prophesied of him, -- but also affirms that this was accomplished both
   on him and towards him before such time as this fiction is pretended to
   fall out, John i. 1, 18; Prov. viii. 14-16; Col. ii. 3; Heb. i. 9; John
   iii. 34.

   Instantly upon his baptism Luke tells you that he was pleres Pneumatos
   hagiou, "full of the Holy Ghost," chap. iv. 1; which was all that was
   required to give him a full furnishment for his office, and all that
   was promised on that account. This answers what he expresses to be
   necessary for the discharge of his prophetical office: Pleres Pneumatos
   agiou is as much as rvch 'dny yhvh ly?, Isa. lxi. 1; and upon that he
   says, "He hath sent me to preach." God also solemnly bare witness to
   him from heaven to the same purpose, Matt. iii. 17. And before this
   John affirmed that he was "the Light of the world, the true Light,
   which lighteth every man that cometh into the world," John i. 9; which
   how he should be, and yet himself be in darkness, not knowing the will
   of God, is not easily to be apprehended.

   3. To what purpose served all that glory at his baptism, that solemn
   inauguration, when he took upon him the immediate administration of his
   prophetical office in his own person, if after this he was to be taken
   up into heaven to be taught the mind of God? To what end were the
   heavens opened over him? to what end did the Holy Ghost descend upon
   him in a visible shape, which God had appointed as a sign whereby he
   should be known to be the great prophet, John i. 32-34? to what end was
   that voice from heaven, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased?" -- I say, to what end were all these, if after all this he
   was ignorant of the gospel and of the will of God, and was to be taken
   up into heaven to be instructed?

   4. If this must be supposed to be without any mention, yet why is it
   said always, that Christ came from heaven to the earth? If he was first
   on the earth, and was taken into heaven, and came again to the earth,
   he had spoken to the understanding of men if he had said, "I am
   returned from heaven;" and not, as he doth, "I am come from heaven.".
   This in lesser matters is observed. Having gone out of Galilee to
   Jordan, and come again, it is said he "returned from Jordan," Luke iv.
   1; [390] and having been with the Gadarenes, upon his coming to the
   other side, from whence he went, it is said he returned from the
   Gadarenes back again, Luke viii. 40. [391] But where is it said that he
   returned from heaven, which, on the supposition that is made, had alone
   in this ease been proper? which propriety of speech is in all other
   cases everywhere observed by the holy writers.

   5. It is said that Christ "entered once into the holy place," and that
   "having obtained eternal redemption," Heb. ix. 12; yea, and expressly
   that he ought to suffer before he so entered, Luke xxiv. 26. But,
   according to these men, he went twice into heaven, -- once before he
   suffered and had obtained eternal redemption, and once afterward. It
   may also be observed, that when they are pressed to tell us some of the
   circumstances of this great matter, being silent to all others, they
   only tell us that they conjecture the time to be in the space of that
   forty days wherein he was in the wilderness; [392] -- on purpose,
   through the righteous judgment of God, to entangle themselves in their
   own imaginations, the Holy Ghost affirming expressly that he was the
   whole "forty days in the wilderness, with the wild beasts," Mark i. 13.
   [393]

   Enough being said to the disprovement of this fiction, I shall very
   briefly touch upon the sense of the places that are produced to give
   countenance thereunto.

   1. In most of the places insisted on there is this expression, "He that
   came down from heaven," or, "I came down from heaven:" so John vi. 32,
   33, 38, 41, 42, 51, 57, 58, iii. 30-32. Hence this is the conclusion,
   "If our Saviour came down from heaven, then, after he had lived some
   time in the world, he was taken up into heaven, there to be taught the
   mind of God." He that hath a mind to grant this consequence is willing
   to be these men's disciple. The Scripture gives us another account of
   the intendment of this phrase, -- namely, "That the Word was with God,
   and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
   and his glory was seen, as the glory of the only-begotten of the
   Father," John i. 1, 2, 14; so that it is not a local descension, but a
   gracious condescension, that is intimated, with his voluntary
   humiliation, when he who was "in the form of God humbled himself to
   take upon him the form of a servant," therein to learn obedience. So
   that these expressions yield very little relief to our adversary.

   2. The second sort are those wherein he is said to "come forth from
   God," or "from the Father," -- this is expressed, John viii. 42, xiii.
   1, 3, xvi. 27-30, xvii. 8, -- from whence an argument of the same
   importance with the former doth arise: "If Christ came from God, from
   the Father, then, after he had been many years in the world, he was
   taken into heaven, and there taught the gospel, and sent again into the
   world." With such invincible demonstrations do these men contend! That
   Christ came from God, from the Father, -- that is, had his mission and
   commission from God, as he was mediator, the great prophet, priest, and
   king of his church, -- none denies, and this is all that in these
   places is expressed; of which afterward.

   3. Some particular places are yet remaining. The first is John iii. 13,
   "No man hath ascended into heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
   the Son of man, which is in heaven." That "which is" Mr B. renders
   rather "which was," whether with greater prejudice to his cause or
   conscience I know not; -- to his cause, in that he manifests that it
   cannot be defended without corrupting the word of God; to his
   conscience, by corrupting it to serve his own end and turn accordingly.
   The words are, ho o en to ourano, which will by no means admit of his
   corrupting gloss.

   I say, then, let the words speak [for] themselves, and you need no
   other [sword] to cut the throat of the whole cause that this man hath
   undertaken to manage. He that speaks is the Son of man, and all the
   time of his speaking he was in heaven. "He," saith he, "is in heaven."
   In his human nature he was then on the earth, not in heaven; therefore
   he had another nature, wherein at that time he was in heaven also, he
   who was so being the Son of man. And what, then, becomes of Mr B.'s
   Christ? and what need of the rapture whereof he speaks?

   [As] for the "ascending into heaven," mentioned in the beginning of the
   verse, that it cannot be meant of a local ascent of Christ in his human
   nature antecedent to his resurrection is evident, in that he had not
   yet "descended into the lower parts of the earth," which he was to do
   before his local ascent, Eph. iv. 9, 10. The ascent there mentioned
   answers the discourse that our Saviour was then upon; which was to
   inform Nicodemus in heavenly things. To this end he tells him (verse
   12) that they were so slow of believing that they could not receive the
   plainest doctrine, nor understand even the visible things of the earth,
   as the blowing of the wind, nor the causes and issue of it; much less
   did they understand the heavenly things of the gospel, which none
   (saith he, verse 13) hath pierced into, is acquainted withal, hath
   ascended, into heaven, in the knowledge of, but he who is in heaven,
   and is sent of God into the world to instruct you. He who is in heaven
   in his divine nature, who is come down from heaven, being sent of God,
   having taken flesh, that he might reveal and do the will of God, he,
   and none but he, hath so ascended into heaven as to have the full
   knowledge of the heavenly things whereof I speak. Of a local ascent, to
   the end and purpose mentioned, there is not the least syllable.

   Thus, I say, the context of the discourse seems to exact a metaphorical
   interpretation of the words, our Saviour in them informing Nicodemus of
   his acquaintance with heavenly things, whereof he was ignorant. But yet
   the propriety of the words may be observed without the least advantage
   to our adversaries, for it is evident that the words are elliptical:
   Oudeis anabebeken eis ton ouranon ei me ho huios. "Ascend" must be
   repeated again to make the sense complete; and why may not mellei
   anabenai be inserted as well as anabebeke? So are the words rendered by
   Theophylact; [394] and in that sense [they] relate not to what was
   before, but what was to be. And an instance of the necessity of an
   alike supplement is given in Matt. xi. 27. Moreover, some suppose that
   anabebeken, affirming the want of a potential conjunction, as an, or
   the like (which the following exceptive ei me require), in the place,
   is not to be taken for the act done, but for the power of doing it, of
   which examples may be given: so that the propriety of the words may
   also be preserved without the least countenance afforded to the figment
   under consideration.

   The remaining place is John vi. 62, "What and if ye shall see the Son
   of man ascend up where he was before?" Hopou en to proteron That Christ
   was in heaven before his local ascent thither in his human nature is
   part of our plea to prove his divine nature, and what will thence be
   obtained I know not.

   And this is the first attempt that these gentlemen make upon the
   prophetical office of Christ: "He did not know the will of God as the
   only-begotten Son of the Father in his bosom; he was not furnished for
   the declaring of it in his own immediate ministry by the unction of the
   Holy Ghost, and his being filled therewith; he was not solemnly
   inaugurated thereinto by the glorious presence of the Father and the
   Holy Ghost with him, one in a voice, and the other in a bodily shape,
   bearing witness to him to be the prophet sent from God; but being for
   many years ignorant of the gospel and the will of God, or what he came
   into the world to do, he was, no man knows where, when, nor how, rapt
   into heaven, and there taught and instructed in the mind of God (as
   Mohammed pretended he was also), and so sent into the world, after he
   had been sent into the world many a year."

   Here the Racovians add:--

   Q. What is that will of God which by Christ is revealed?

   A. It is the new covenant, which Christ, in the name of God, made with
   human kind; whence also he is called "the mediator of the new
   covenant." [395]

   1. It seems, then, that Christ was taken into heaven to be taught the
   new covenant, of which before he was ignorant; though the very name
   that was given him before he was born contained the substance of it,
   Matt. i. 21. 2. Christ did not make the covenant with us as mediator,
   but confirmed and ratified it, Heb. ix. 15-17. God gave him in the
   covenant which he made, and therefore is said to "give him for a
   covenant," Isa. xlii. 6. 3. The covenant of grace is not made with all
   mankind, but with the seed of the woman, Gen. iii. 15; Gal. iii. 16;
   Rom. ix. 7, 8. 4. Christ is not called the mediator of the new covenant
   because he declared the will of God concerning it, but because he gave
   his life a ransom for those with whom it is made, 1 Tim. ii. 5, 6; and
   the promises of it were confirmed in his blood, Heb. ix. 15, x. 16-20.
   5. This covenant was not first made and revealed when Christ taught in
   his own person It was not only made but confirmed to Abraham in Christ
   four hundred and thirty years before the law, Gal. iii. 17; yea, ever
   since the entrance of sin, no man hath walked with God but in the same
   covenant of grace, as elsewhere is declared.

   Let us see what follows in Mr B. Says he, --

   Q. You have already showed that Christ was like unto Moses in seeing
   God, and hearing from him the things which he spake: but Moses exceeded
   all other prophets likewise in that he only was a lawgiver; was Christ
   therefore like unto Moses in giving of a law also, and is there any
   mention of this law?

   A. Gal. vi. 2, "Fulfil the law of Christ;" Rom. iii. 27, "By the law of
   faith;" James ii. 12, "By the law of liberty;" James i. 25.

   1. That Moses did not see the face of God hath been showed, and Mr B.
   confesseth the same. That Christ was not rapt into heaven for any such
   end or purpose as is pretended, that he is not compared to Moses as to
   his initiation into his prophetical office, that there is not one word
   in the Scripture giving countenance to any of these figments, hath been
   evinced; nor hath Mr B. showed any such thing to them who have their
   senses exercised to discern good and evil, what apprehensions soever
   his catechumens may have of his skill and proofs.

   2. What is added to this question will be of an easy despatch. The word
   "law' may be considered generally, as to the nature of it, in the sense
   of Scripture, for a revelation of the mind of God; and so we say Christ
   did give a law, in that he revealed fully and clearly the whole mind of
   God as to our salvation and the obedience he requireth of us. And so
   there is a law of faith, that is, a doctrine of faith, opposite to the
   law as to its covenant ends, simply so called. And he also instituted
   some peculiarly significant ceremonies to be used in the worship of
   God; pressing, in particular, in his teaching and by his example, the
   duty of love; which thence is peculiarly called "a new commandment,"
   John xiii. 34, and "the law of Christ," Gal. vi. 2, even that which he
   did so eminently practice. As he was a teacher, a prophet come out from
   God, he taught the mind, and will, and worship of God, from his own
   bosom, John i. 18, Heb. i. 1, 2. And as he was and is the king of his
   church, he hath given precepts, and laws, and ordinances, for the rule
   and government thereof, to which none can add, nor from them any
   detract. But take the word "law" strictly in reference to a covenant
   end, so that he which performs it shall be justified by his performance
   thereof, so we may say he gave the law originally as God, but as
   mediator he gave no such law, or no law in that sense, but revealed
   fully and clearly our justification with God upon another account, and
   gave no new precepts of obedience but what were before given in the
   law, written originally in the heart of man by nature, and delivered to
   the church of the Jews by Moses in the wilderness; of which in the
   chapter of justification.

   For the places quoted by Mr B., that of Gal. vi. 2, "Bear ye one
   another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ," speaks only of
   that one command of brotherly love and forbearance which is called
   peculiarly, as I said, "a new commandment," though the Jews had it from
   the beginning, and the "law of Christ," because of the eminent
   accomplishment of it by "him who loved us, and gave himself for us,"
   transmitting it anew to us with such new motives and inducements as it
   had not received before, nor ever shall again. The "law of faith,"
   mentioned Rom. iii. 27, is no more but the doctrine of the gospel, and
   justification without the works of the law, -- that is, all works
   commanded, by what law soever; as the whole doctrine of the word of God
   is called "the law" near an hundred times in the Psalms. The "law of
   faith" is that which is opposed to the "law of works," as a means of
   obtaining righteousness, which is not by obedience to new commands.

   The places in James ii. 12, i. 25, speak directly of the moral law;
   which is manifest by that particular enumeration of its precepts which
   we have subjoined, chap. ii. 10-12.

   3. But Mr B.'s masters have a farther reach in the asserting Christ to
   have given a new law, -- namely, whereas they place justification as a
   consequent of our own obedience, and observing how impossible it is to
   do it on the obedience yielded to the moral law, the apostle having so
   frequently and expressly decried all possibility of justification
   thereby, they have therefore feigned to themselves that Christ Jesus
   hath given a new law, in obedience whereunto we may be justified; which
   when they attempt to prove, it will be needful for them to produce
   other manner of evidences than that here by Mr B. insisted on, which
   speaks not one word to the purpose in hand. But that this is the
   intendment of the man is evident from his ensuing discourse.

   Having reckoned up the expositions of the law, and its vindication
   given by our Saviour, Matt. v., in the next query he calls them, very
   ignorantly, "the law of faith, or the new covenant." If Mr B. knows no
   more of the new covenant but that it is a new law given by our Saviour,
   Matt. v.-vii.. (as upon other accounts), I pity the man. He proceeds,
   --

   Q. Doth not Christ, then, partly perfect, partly correct the law of
   Moses? What is the determination of Christ concerning this matter?

   A. Matt. v. 21-45.

   1. The reason of this query I acquainted the reader with before. These
   men, seeking for a righteousness, as it were, by the works of the law,
   [396] and not daring to lay it upon that which the apostle doth so
   often expressly reject, they strive to relieve themselves with this,
   that our Saviour hath so dealt with the law as here is expressed; so
   that to yield obedience to it now, as mended, perfected, and reformed,
   must needs be sufficient to our justification.

   2. Two things are here affirmed to be done by the Lord Christ in
   reference to the "law of Moses," as it is called, -- that is, the moral
   law, as is evident by the following instances given to make good the
   assertion, -- first, That he perfects it; secondly, That he corrects
   it: and so a double imputation is laid on the law of God, (1.) Of
   imperfection; (2.) Of corruption, that needed amendment or correction.

   Before I proceed to examine the particular instances whereby the man
   attempts to make good his insinuation, the honour of God and his law
   requires of us that it be vindicated from this double calumny, and
   demonstrated to be neither imperfect nor to stand in need of
   correction:--

   1. For its perfection, we have the testimony of God himself expressly
   given thereunto: Ps. xix. 7, "The law of the Lord is perfect,
   converting the soul;" it is the "perfect law of liberty," James i. 25;
   yea, so perfect as that God hath forbidden any thing to be added to it
   or to be taken from it, Deut. xii. 32.

   2. If the law wants perfection, it is in respect of its essential
   parts, or its integral parts, or in respect of degrees. But for its
   essential parts, it is perfect, being, in matter and form, in sense and
   sentence, divine, holy, just, good, Rom. vii. 12. For its integrals, it
   compriseth "the whole duty of man," Eccles. xii. 13; which doing he was
   to live. And for the degrees of its commands, it requireth that we love
   the Lord our God with all our hearts and all our souls, and our
   neighbours as ourselves; which our Saviour confirms as a rule of
   perfection, Matt. xxii. 36-40.

   3. If the law of God was not perfect, but needed correction, it is
   either because God could not or would not give a perfect and complete
   law. To say the first is blasphemy; for the latter, there is no
   pretence for it. God giving a law for his service, proclaiming his
   wisdom and holiness to be therein, and that if any man did perform it,
   he should live therein, certainly would not give such a law as, by its
   imperfection, should come short of any of the ends and purposes for
   which it was appointed.

   4. The perfection of the law is hence also evinced, that the precepts
   of Christ, wherein our obedience requires us to be perfect, are the
   same and no other than the precepts of the law. His new commandment of
   love is also an old one, 1 John ii. 7, 8, which Christ calls his new
   commandment, John xiii. 34; and the like instances might be multiplied.
   Neither will the instance of Mr B. evince the contrary, which he argues
   from Matt. v.; for that Christ doth not in that chapter correct the
   law, nor add any new precept thereunto, but expounds and vindicates it
   from the corrupt glosses of the scribes and Pharisees, appears, --

   (1.) From the occasion of the discourse, and the proposition which our
   Saviour makes good, establisheth, and confirmeth therein, which is laid
   down, verse 20, "Except your righteousness shall exceed the
   righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
   into the kingdom of heaven." In pursuit of this proposition, he
   manifesteth what their righteousness was, by examining their catechism
   upon the commandments, and the exposition they made therein of them. It
   is not the righteousness of the law that our Saviour rejects, and
   requires more in his disciples, but that of the Pharisees, whom he
   everywhere called hypocrites. But for the law, he tells them a tittle
   of it shall not pass away, and he that keeps it shall be called great,
   or be of great esteem, in the kingdom of God; and the good works that
   our Saviour then required in his disciples are no other but those that
   were commanded in the law.

   (2.) The very phraseology and manner of speech here used by our Saviour
   manifests of whom and concerning what he speaks: "Ye have heard that it
   was said to them of old time;" -- "Ye have heard," not. "Ye have read."
   "Ye have heard it of the scribes and Pharisees out of Moses' chair;
   they have told you that it was thus said." And, "Ye have heard that it
   was said to them of old;" not "that it was written, that it was written
   in the law," the expression whereby he citeth what was written. And,
   "It was said to them of old," -- the common pretence of the Pharisees,
   in the imposing their traditions and expositions of the law. "It is the
   tradition of the elders; it was said to them by such and such blessed
   masters of old."

   (3.) Things are instanced in that are nowhere written in the law, nor
   ever were; as that, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine
   enemy;" which is so remote from the law as that the contrary is
   directly commanded, Lev. xix. 18; Exod. xxiii. 4, 5; Prov. xx. 22. To
   them who gave this rule, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine
   enemy," doth Christ oppose himself. But those were the scribes and
   Pharisees in their corrupt glosses, from which God's law is vindicated,
   not in itself before corrupted.

   (4.) Whose sayings Christ rejects, their sayings he did not come to
   fulfil; but he came to fulfil and accomplish the law: and therefore it
   is not the law and the sentence thereof that he rejects in that form of
   speech, "But I say unto you."

   Before I come to the consideration of the particular instances given by
   Mr B., a brief consideration of what is offered to this purpose by
   Smalcius, in his Racovian Catechism, may be premised. His first
   chapter, about the prophetical office of Christ, is "De præceptis
   Christi, quæ legi addidit;" -- "Of the precepts of Christ, which he
   added to the law." And therein this is his first question and answer:--

   Q. What are the perfect commands of God revealed by Christ?

   A. Part of them is contained in the precepts given by Moses, with those
   which are added thereunto in the new covenant; part is contained in
   those things which Christ himself prescribed. [397]

   The commands of God revealed by Jesus Christ are here referred to three
   heads:-- 1. The ten commandments given by Moses; for so that part is
   explained in the next question, where they are said to be the
   decalogue. 2. The additions made by Christ thereunto. 3. His own
   peculiar institutions.

   1. As to the first, I desire only to know how the ten commandments were
   revealed by Jesus Christ. The catechist confesseth that they were given
   to Moses, and revealed by that means; how are they, then, said to be
   revealed by Christ? If they shall say that he may be said to reveal
   them because he promulged them anew, with new motives, reasons, and
   encouragements, I hope he will give us leave to say also that what he
   calls "a new commandment" is not so termed in respect of the matter of
   it, but its new enforcement by Christ. We grant Christ revealed that
   law of Moses, with its new covenant ends, as he was the great prophet
   of his church, by his Spirit, from the foundation of the world; but
   this Smalcius denies.

   2. That Christ made no new additions to the moral law hath been partly
   evidenced from what hath been spoken concerning the perfection thereof,
   with the intention of our Saviour in that place, and those things
   wherein they say these additions are found and do consist, and shall
   yet farther be evinced from the consideration of the particulars by
   them instanced in.

   3. It is granted that our blessed Saviour did, for the times of the new
   testament, institute the two ordinances of baptism and the Lord's
   supper, in the room of them which, together with their representation
   of the benefits which believers receive by him, did also prefigure him
   as to come. But, -- (1.) These are no new law, nor part of a new law,
   with a law design in them. (2.) Though there is an obedience in their
   performance yielded to God and Christ, yet they belong rather to the
   promises than the precepts of Christ; to our privilege, -- before, unto
   our duty.

   In the progress of that catechist, after some discourse about the
   ceremonial and judicial law, with their abolition, and his allowance of
   magistrates among Christians notwithstanding (which they do upon
   condition they shed no blood, for any cause whatever), he attempts in
   particular to show what Christ added to the moral law in the several
   precepts of it. And to the first he says that Christ added two
   things:-- 1. In that he prescribed us a certain form of prayer; of
   which afterward, in the chapter designed to the consideration of what
   Mr B. speaks to the same purpose. 2. That we acknowledge himself for
   God, and worship him; of which also in our discourse of the kingly
   office of Christ. To the second, he says, is added in the New
   Testament, not only that we should not worship images, but avoid them
   also; which is so notoriously false, the avoiding of images of our own
   making being no less commanded in the Old Testament than in the New,
   that I shall not insist thereon. The residue of his plea is the same
   with Mr B.'s from Matt. v., where what they pretend shall be considered
   in order.

   To consider, then, briefly the particular instances. 1. The first is in
   reference to the sixth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill." This the
   Pharisees so interpreted as that if a man kept himself from blood and
   from causing the death of another, he was righteous as to the keeping
   of this commandment. Our Saviour lets his disciples know that there is
   a closer and nearer sense of this law: "I say unto you, in the
   exposition of this commandment, that any rash anger, anger without a
   cause, all offence given proceeding from thence, in light, vilifying
   expressions, such as Raca,' much more all provoking taunts and
   reproaches, as Thou fool,' are forbidden therein, so as to render a man
   obnoxious to the judgment of God, and condemnation in their several
   degrees of sinfulness;" [398] as there were amongst themselves several
   councils, according to several offences, -- the judgment, the council,
   and utter cutting off as a child of hell. Hence, then, having
   manifested the least breach of love or charity towards our brother to
   be a breach of the sixth commandment, and so to render a man obnoxious
   to the judgment of God in several degrees of sin, according as the
   eruptions of it are, he proceeds in the following verses to exhort his
   disciples to patience, forbearance, and brotherly love, with readiness
   to agreement and forgiveness, verses 23-26.

   2. In the next place, he proceeds to the vindication and exposition of
   the seventh commandment, verse 27, "Thou shalt not commit adultery;"
   which the Pharisees had so expounded as that if a man kept himself from
   actual uncleanness, however loosely he lived, and put away his wife at
   his pleasure, he was free from the breach thereof. To give them the
   true meaning and sense of this commandment, and farther to discover the
   hypocrisy of the Pharisees, he lets them know, --

   (1.) That the concupiscence of the heart or inordinate desire of any
   person is the adultery here no less forbidden than that of actual
   uncleanness, which the law made death. And certainly he must needs be
   as blind as a Pharisee who sees not that the uncleanness of the heart
   and lust after woman was forbidden by the law and under the old
   testament.

   (2.) As to their living with their wives, he mentions, indeed, the
   words of Moses, "Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a
   bill of divorcement," but opposeth not himself thereunto at all, but
   only shows that that permission of divorce is to be interpreted
   according to the rule and instruction given in the first institution of
   marriage (as afterward, on another occasion, he explains himself, Matt.
   xix.), and not that men might therefore, for every cause that they
   would or could pretend, instantly put away their wives, as the
   Pharisees taught men to do, and as Josephus, one of them, testifies of
   himself that he did: "I put away my wife," saith he, "because she did
   not please me." "No," saith our Saviour; "that permission of Moses is
   not to be extended beyond the just cause of divorce, as it is by the
   Pharisees, but made use of only in the case of fornication," verses 31,
   32; and he thereupon descends to caution his disciples to be careful
   and circumspect in their walking in this particular, and not be led by
   an offending eye or hand (the beginning of evil) to greater
   abominations, verses 28-30.

   3. In like manner doth he proceed in the vindication of the third
   commandment. The scribes and Pharisees had invented or approved of
   swearing by creatures, the temple, altar, Jerusalem, the head, and the
   like; and thereupon they raised many wicked and cursed distinctions, on
   purpose to make a cloak for hypocrisy and lying, as you may see, Matt.
   xxiii. 16-19. "If a man swear by the temple, it is nothing, he is not
   bound by his oath; but if he swear by the gold of the temple, he is
   obliged." In like manner did they distinguish of the altar and the
   gift. And having mixed these swearings and distinctions in their
   ordinary conversation, there was nothing sincere or open and plain left
   amongst them. This wicked gloss of theirs (being such as their
   successors abound withal to this day) our blessed Saviour decries, and
   commands his disciples to use plainness and simplicity in their
   conversation, in plain affirmations and negations, without the mixture
   of such profane and cursed distinctions, verses 34-37, which that it
   was no new duty, nor unknown to the saints of the old testament, is
   known to all that have but read it.

   4. In matter of judgment between man and man, he proceeds in the same
   manner. Because the law had appointed the magistrate to exercise
   talionem in some cases, and to take an eye for an eye, and a tooth for
   a tooth, the blind Pharisees wrested this to countenance private men in
   revenging themselves, and pursuing them who had injured them with a
   hostile mind, at least until the sentence of the law was executed on
   them. To root the rancour and malice out of the minds of men which by
   this means were nourished and fomented in them, our Saviour lets them
   know that notwithstanding that procedure of the magistrate by the law,
   yet indeed all private revenges were forbidden and all readiness to
   contend with others, which he amplifieth in the proposal of some
   particular cases; and all this by virtue of a rule which himself
   affirms to be contained in the law, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself," verses 38-42, pressing also lending and giving, as works of
   charity, whereunto a blessing is so often pronounced in the Old
   Testament.

   5. His last instance is in the matter of love, concerning which the
   Pharisees had given out this note, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and
   hate thine enemy;" for whereas there were certain nations whom God had
   appointed to utter destruction at his people's first coming into
   Canaan, he commanded them to show them no mercy, but utterly to destroy
   them, Deut. vii. 2. This the wretched hypocrites laid hold of to make
   up a rule and law for private men to walk by in reference to them whom
   they accounted their enemies, in express contradiction to the command
   of God, Exod. xxiii. 4, 5, Lev. xix. 18. Wherefore our blessed Saviour
   vindicates the sense of the law from this cursed tradition also, and
   renews the precept of loving and doing good to our enemies, verses
   43-47. So that in none of the instances mentioned is there the least
   evidence of what was proposed to be confirmed by them, -- namely, that
   our Saviour gave a new law, in that he did partly perfect, partly
   correct the law of Moses, -- seeing he did only vindicate the sense and
   meaning of the law, in sundry precepts thereof, from the false glosses
   and traditions of the scribes and Pharisees, invented and imposed on
   their disciples to be a cloak to their hypocrisy and wickedness. And
   this also may fully suffice to remove what on this account is delivered
   by the Racovian Catechism. But on this foundation Mr B. proceeds:--

   Q. You have made it appear plainly that the law of faith or the new
   covenant, whereof Christ was the mediator, is better than the law of
   works or the old covenant, whereof Moses was the mediator, in respect
   of precepts; is it also better in respect of promises?

   A. Heb. viii. 6, vii. 19.

   This is indeed a comfortable passage! for the better understanding
   whereof I shall single out the several noble propositions that are
   insinuated therein, and evidently contained in the words of it; as, --

   1. Christ was the mediator of the law of faith, the new law, in the
   same sense as Moses was mediator of the old law, the law of works.

   2. Christ's addition of precepts and promises to the law of Moses is
   the law of faith, or the new covenant.

   3. The people or church of the Jews lived under the old covenant, or
   the law of works, whereof Moses, not Christ, was the mediator.

   4. The difference between the old and the new covenant lies in this,
   that the new hath more precepts of obedience and more promises than the
   old.

   And now, truly, he that thinks that this man understands either the old
   covenant or the new, either Moses or Christ, either faith or works,
   shall have liberty from me to enjoy his opinion, for I have not more to
   add to convince him of his mistake than what the man himself hath here
   delivered.

   For my part, I have much other work to do, occasioned by Mr B., and
   therefore I shall not here divert to the consideration of the two
   covenants and their difference, with the twofold administration of the
   covenant of grace, both before and after Christ's coming in the flesh;
   but I shall content myself with some brief animadversions upon the
   forementioned propositions and proceed:--

   1. In what sense Christ is the mediator of the new covenant, I shall,
   God assisting, at large declare, when I come to treat of his death and
   satisfaction, and shall not here prevent myself in any thing of what
   must then and there be delivered.

   2. That there are precepts and promises attending the new covenant is
   granted; but that it consists in any addition of precepts to the
   Mosaical law, carried on in the same tenor with it, with other
   promises, is a figment directly destructive of the whole gospel and the
   mediation of the Son of God. By this means, the whole undertaking of
   Jesus Christ to lay down his life a ransom for us, -- our justification
   by his blood, his being of God made righteousness to us, the free
   pardon of our sins and acceptation with God by and for him, as he is
   the end of the law for righteousness; all communication of effectual
   grace to work in us new obedience, the giving of a new, clean heart,
   with the law of God written in it by the Spirit; in a word, the whole
   promise made to Abraham, the whole new covenant, is excluded from the
   covenant, and men left yet in their sins. The covenant of works was,
   "Do this, and live;" and the tenor of the law, "If a man do the things
   thereof, he shall live thereby," -- that is, if a man by his own
   strength perform and fulfil the righteousness that the law requires, he
   shall have eternal life thereby. "This covenant," saith the apostle,
   "God hath disannulled, because no man could be saved by it," Heb. vii.
   18. "The law thereof, through sin, was become weak and insufficient as
   to any such end and purpose," Rom. viii. 3. What, then, doth God
   substitute in room thereof? Why, a new covenant, that hath more
   precepts added to the old, with all those of the old continued that
   respected moral obedience! But is this a remedy? is not this rather a
   new burden? If the law could not save us before, because it was
   impossible, through sin, that we should perfectly accomplish it, and
   therefore "by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified," is it
   a likely way to relieve us by making an addition of more precepts to
   them which before we could not observe? But that, through the righteous
   hand of God, the interest of men's immortal souls is come to be
   concerned therein, I should think the time exceedingly lavished that is
   spent in this discourse. "Let him that is ignorant be ignorant still,"
   were a sufficient answer. And this that hath been said may suffice to
   the fourth particular also.

   3. That Moses was a mediator of a covenant of works, properly and
   formally so called, and that the church of the Jews lived under a
   covenant of works, is a no less pernicious figment than the former. The
   covenant of works was, "Do this, and live;" -- "On perfect obedience
   you shall have life." Mercy and pardon of sins were utter strangers to
   that covenant; and therefore by it the Holy Ghost tells us that no man
   could be saved. The church of old had the promises of Christ, Rom. ix.
   4, Gen. iii. 15, xii. 3; were justified by faith, Gen. xv. 6, Rom. iv.,
   Gal. iii.; obtained mercy for their sins, and were justified in the
   Lord, Isa. xlv. 24, 25; had the Spirit for conversion, regeneration,
   and sanctification, Ezek. xi. 19, xxxvi. 26; expected and obtained
   salvation by Jesus Christ; -- things as remote from the covenant of
   works as the east is from the west.

   It is true, the administration of the covenant of grace which they
   lived under was dark, legal, and low, in comparison of that which we
   now are admitted unto since the coming of Christ in the flesh; but the
   covenant wherein they walked with God and that wherein we find
   acceptance is the same, and the justification of Abraham their father
   the pattern of ours, Rom. iv. 4, 5.

   Let us now see what answer Mr B. applies to his query. The first text
   he mentions is Heb. viii. 6, "But now hath he obtained a more excellent
   ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant,
   which was established upon better promises." That which the Holy Ghost
   here affirms is, that the new covenant, whereof Christ is the mediator,
   is better than the old, and that it hath better promises; which, I
   suppose, none ever doubted. The covenant is better, seeing that could
   by no means save us, while by this Christ doth to the uttermost. The
   promises are better, for it hath innumerable promises of conversion,
   pardon, and perseverance, which that had not at all; and the promise of
   eternal life, which that had, is given upon infinitely better and surer
   terms. But all this is nothing at all to Mr B.'s purpose.

   No more is the second place which he mentioneth, Heb. vii. 19, "The law
   made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did."

   Not that by "the law" in that place the covenant of works is intended,
   but the legal administration of the covenant of grace. "This," saith
   the apostle, "made nothing perfect." Men were kept under types and
   shadows; and though they were children of God by adoption, yet in
   comparison they were kept as servants, being under age, until the
   fulness of time came, when the bringing in of Jesus Christ, that
   "better hope," made the administration of grace perfect and complete,
   Gal. iv. 1-6. Mr B. all along obscures himself under the ambiguous term
   of "the law," confounding its covenant and subsequent use. As for the
   covenant use of the law, or as it was the tenor of the covenant of
   works, the saints of the old testament were no more concerned in it
   than are we. The subsequent use of it may be considered two ways, -- 1.
   As it is purely moral, exacting perfect obedience, and so the use of it
   is common to them and us; 2. As attended with ceremonial and judicial
   institutions in the administration of it, and so it was peculiar to
   them. And this one observation will lead the reader through much of the
   sophistry of this chapter, whose next question is, --

   Q. Were those better promises of God touching eternal life and
   immortality hidden in the dark and not brought to light under the law?

   A. "Jesus Christ hath brought life and immortality to light through the
   gospel," 2 Tim. i. 10.

   The whole ambiguity of this question lies in these expressions, "Hidden
   in the dark and not brought to light." If he intend comparatively, in
   respect of the clear revelation made of the mind and will of God by
   Jesus Christ, we grant it. If he mean it absolutely, that there were no
   promises of life and immortality given under the law, it is absolutely
   false; for, --

   1. There are innumerable promises of life and immortality in the Old
   Testament given to the church under the law. See Heb. xi. 14; Deut.
   xii. 1, xxx. 6; Ps. xvi. 10, 11; Deut. xxxii. 29; Ps. cxxx. 8; Isa.
   xxv. 8, 9, xlv. 17, xxvi. 19; Jer. xxiii. 6; Ps. ii. 12, xxxii. 1, 2,
   xxxiii. 12.

   2. They believed in eternal life, and therefore they had the promise of
   it; for faith relieth always on the word of promise. Thus did Job xix.
   25-27; and David, Ps. xvii. 15; so did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Heb.
   xi. 10, 13, 14; yea, and some of them, as a pattern and example,
   without dying obtained it, as Enoch and Elijah.

   3. The covenant of Abraham was that which they lived in and under. But
   this covenant of Abraham had promises of eternal life, even that God
   would be his God, dead and alive, Gen. xvii. 1, 7. And that the
   promises thereof were promises of eternal life, Paul manifests, Rom.
   iv. 3, Gal. iii. 14. But this hath been so abundantly manifested by
   others that I shall not longer insist upon it. We are come to the last
   query of this chapter, which is:--

   Q. Though the promises of the gospel be better than those of the law,
   pet are they not, as well as those of the law, proposed under
   conditions of faith and perseverance therein, of holiness and
   obedience, of repentance, and suffering for Christ? how speak the
   Scriptures?

   A. John iii. 14-16, 18, 36; Hab. ii. 4; Heb. xi. 6; 2 Tim. ii. 11; Rom.
   viii. 13; Acts iii. 19; Rev. ii. 5, 16; John v. 14.

   Neither will this query long detain us. In the new testament, there
   being means designed for the attainment of an end, -- faith, obedience,
   and perseverance, for the attainment of salvation and enjoyment of God
   through Christ, -- the promises of it are of two sorts. Some respect
   the end, or our whole acceptation with God; some the means, or way
   whereby we come to be accepted in Christ. The first sort are those
   insisted on by Mr B., and they are so far conditional as that they
   declare the firm connection and concatenation of the end and means
   proposed, so that without them it is not to be attained; but the other,
   of working faith, and new obedience, and perseverance, are all absolute
   to the children of the covenant, as I have so fully and largely
   elsewhere declared that I shall not here repeat any thing there
   written, nor do I know any necessity of adding any thing thereunto.
   [399] I thought to have proceeded with the Racovian Catechism also, as
   in the former part of the discourse; but having made this process, I
   had notice of an answer to the whole by Arnoldus, the professor of
   divinity at Franeker; and therefore, that I may not actum agere, nor
   seem to enter another's labour, I shall not directly and kata poda
   carry on a confutation thereof hereafter, but only divert thereunto as
   I shall have occasion, yet not omitting any thing of weight therein, as
   in this chapter I have not, as to the matter under consideration.

Chapter XIX.

   Of the kingly office of Jesus Christ, and of the worship that is
   ascribed and due to him.

   Of the nature of the kingly office of Jesus Christ, his investiture
   with it, his administration of it, with the efficacy of that power
   which therein he puts forth, both towards his elect and others, Mr
   Biddle doth not administer any occasion to discourse. It is
   acknowledged by him that he was, or at least is, a king, by the
   designation and appointment of the Father, to whom, as he was mediator,
   he was subject; that he abides in his rule and dominion as such, and
   shall do so to the end of the world; and I shall not make any farther
   inquiry as to these things, unless farther occasion be administered.
   Upon the account of this authority they say he is God. But whereas it
   is certain that this authority of his shall cease at the end of the
   world, 1 Cor. xv. 28, it seems that he shall then also cease to be God,
   such a God as they now allow him to be.

   By some passages in his second and third questions, he seems to
   intimate that Christ was not invested in his kingdom before his
   ascension into heaven. So question the second, "Is Christ already
   invested in his kingdom, and did he, after his ascension and sitting
   down at the right hand of God, exercise dominion and sovereignty over
   men and angels?" and question third, "For what cause and to what end
   was Jesus Christ exalted to his kingdom?" -- to which he answers from
   Phil. ii. 8-10 in both places; intimating that Christ was not invested
   with his kingly power until after his exaltation. (As for the ends of
   his exaltation, these being some mentioned, though not all, nor the
   chief, I shall not farther insist on them.) But this, as it is contrary
   to the testimony that himself gave of his being a king in a kingdom
   which was not of this world, it being a great part of that office
   whereunto he was of his Father anointed, so it is altogether
   inconsistent with Mr B.'s principles, who maintains that he was
   worshipped with religious worship and honour whilst he was upon the
   earth; which honour and worship, says he, are due to him and to be
   performed merely upon the account of that power and authority which is
   given him of God, as also say all his companions; and certainly his
   power and authority belong to him as king. The making of him a king and
   the making of him a god is with them all one; but that he was a god
   whilst he was upon the earth they acknowledge from the words of Thomas
   to him, "My Lord and my God."

   And the title of the 12th chapter of Smalcius' book, "De Vera Jesu
   Christi Divinitate," is, "De nomine Dei, quod Jesus Christus in terris
   mortalis degens habuit;" [400] which in the chapter itself he seeks to
   make good by sundry instances, and in the issue labours to prove that
   the sole cause of the attribution of that name to him is from his
   office; but what office, indeed, he expresseth not. The name of God,
   they say, is a name of office and authority; the authority of Christ,
   on which account he is to be worshipped, is that which he hath as king.
   And yet the same author afterward contends that Christ was not a king
   until after his resurrection and ascension. [401] For my part, I am not
   solicitous about reconciling him to himself; let them that are so take
   pains, if they please, therein. Some pains, I conceive, it may cost
   them, considering that he afterward affirms expressly that he was
   called Lord and God of Thomas because of his divine rule or kingdom;
   which, as I remember, was before his ascension.

   As for his exaltation at his ascension, it was not by any investiture
   in any new office, but by an admission to the execution of that part of
   his work of mediatorship which did remain, in a full and glorious
   manner, the whole concernment of his humiliation being past. In the
   meantime, doubtless, he was a king when the Lord of glory was
   crucified, 1 Cor. ii. 8.

   But that which remains of this chapter is more fully to be considered.

   Question 4 is, "How ought men to honour the Son of God?"

   From hence to the end of the chapter, Mr B. insists on the religious
   worship and invocation of Jesus Christ; which, with all his companions,
   he places as the consequent of his kingly office and of that authority
   wherewith, for the execution and discharge thereof, from God he is
   invested. I shall very briefly consider what is tendered by Mr B. to
   the purpose in hand, and then take liberty a little more largely to
   handle the whole business of the worship of Jesus Christ, with the
   grounds, reasons, and motives thereof.

   His fourth question to this matter is, "How ought men to honour the Son
   of God, Christ Jesus," and it is answered, "John v. 23, Even as they
   honour the Father.'?"

   This, then, is consented unto on both sides, that Jesus Christ is to be
   worshipped and honoured with the same worship and honour wherewith the
   Father is worshipped and honoured; that is, with that worship and
   honour which is divine and religious, -- with that subjection of soul,
   and in the performance of those duties, which are due to God alone.
   [402] How Socinus himself doubled in this business and was entangled
   shall be afterward discovered. What use will be made of this in the
   issue of this discourse the reader may easily conjecture.

   His next question, discovering the danger of the non-performance of
   this duty of yielding divine honour and worship to Christ, strengthens
   the former assertion, and therefore I have nothing to except or add
   thereunto.

   In question the sixth, Mr B. labours to defend the throat of his cause
   against the edge of that weapon which is sharpened against it by this
   concession, that Jesus Christ is to be worshipped with divine worship
   as the Father is, by a diversion of it, with a consideration of the
   grounds of the assignation of this worship to Christ. His words are:--

   Q. Ought men to honour the Son as they honour the Father because he
   hath the same essence with the Father, or because he hath the same
   judiciary power? what is the decision of the Son himself concerning
   this point?

   A. John v. 22, 23.

   The sum is: The same worship is to be given to the Father and the Son,
   but upon several grounds; -- to the Father, because he is God by
   nature, because of his divine essence; to the Son, because of a
   delegated judiciary power committed to him by the Father. For the
   discovery of the vanity of this assertion, in the close of our
   consideration of this matter, I shall manifest, --

   1. That there neither is nor can be any more than one formal cause of
   the attribution of the same divine worship to any one; so that to
   whomsoever it is ascribed, it is upon one and the same individual
   account, as to the formal and fundamental cause thereof.

   2. That no delegated power of judgment is or can be a sufficient ground
   or cause of yielding that worship and honour to him to whom it is
   delegated which is proper to God.

   For the present, to the text pleaded, "The Father judgeth no man, but
   hath committed all judgment unto the Son, that all men should honour
   the Son, even as they honour the Father," I say in brief, that hina
   pantes timosi is not expressive of the formal cause of the honouring
   and adoration of Christ, but of an effectual motive to men to honour
   him, to whom, upon the account of his divine nature, that honour is
   due; -- as in the first commandment, "I am the Lord thy God, that
   brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
   thou shalt have no other gods before me," that expression, "That
   brought thee out of the land of Egypt," is a motive to the worship of
   God, but not the formal cause of it, that being due to him as he is by
   nature God, blessed for ever, though he had never brought that people
   out of Egypt. But of this more afterward.

   Question 7, a farther diversion from the matter in hand is attempted by
   this inquiry:--

   Q. Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, because he had in
   him the divine nature personally united to the human, or because he was
   the Son of man? what is the decision of the Son himself concerning this
   point also?

   A. "He hath given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the
   Son of man," John v. 27.

   1. A point in difference is stated, and its decision inquired after,
   wherein there is no such difference at all. Nor do we say that God gave
   Christ the judiciary power, wherewith as mediator he is invested,
   because he had in him the divine nature personally united to the human.
   The power that Christ hath upon the account of his divine nature is not
   delegated, but essential to him. Nor can Mr B. name any that have so
   stated the difference as he here proposes it.

   2. We say not that Christ had in him the divine nature personally
   united to the human, but that the human nature was personally united to
   the divine, his personality belonging to him upon the account of his
   divine nature, not his human.

   3. We grant that the judiciary power that was delegated to Christ as
   mediator, he being appointed of God to judge the world, was given him
   "because he is the Son of man," or was made man to be our mediator, and
   to accomplish the great work of the salvation of mankind; but that
   divine worship, proper to God the Father, is due, and to be yielded and
   ascribed to him, on this ground and reason, "because he is the Son of
   man," Mr B. cannot prove, nor doth attempt it.

   The 8th, 9th, and 10th questions belong not to us. We grant it was and
   is the will and command of God that Jesus Christ, the mediator, should
   be worshipped of angels and men, and that he was so worshipped even in
   this world, for "when he brought the first-begotten into the world, he
   said, Let all the angels of God worship him," Heb. i. 6; and that he is
   also to be worshipped now, having finished his work, being exalted on
   the right hand of God; -- but that the bottom, foundation, and sold
   formal cause of the worship which God so commands to be yielded to him,
   is any thing but his being "God, blessed for evermore," or his being
   the "only-begotten Son of God," there is not in the places mentioned
   the least intimation.

   The 11th and 12th look again the same way with the former, and with the
   same success. Saith he, --

   Q. When men ascribe glory and dominion to Jesus Christ in the
   Scripture, and withal intimate the ground thereof, is it because they
   conceive him to be very God, and to have been eternally begotten out of
   the divine essence, or because he gave himself to death? let me hear
   how they explain themselves?

   A. Rev. v. 9.

   Q. Are the angels of the same opinion with the saints, when they also
   ascribe the glory and dominion to him? let me hear how they also
   explain themselves?

   A. Rev. v. 11, 12.

   Of both these places afterward.

   At present, -- 1. Christ as a lamb is Christ as mediator, both God and
   man, to whom all honour and glory is due.

   2. Neither saints nor angels do give, nor pretend to give, the reason
   why Christ is to be worshipped, or what is the formal reason why divine
   worship is ascribed to him, but only what is in their thoughts and
   considerations a powerful and effectual motive to love, fear, worship,
   and ascribe all glory to him; as David often cries, "Bless the Lord, O
   my soul!" (or assigns glory and honour to him), because he had done
   such or such things, intimating a motive to his worship, and not the
   prime foundation and cause why he is to be worshipped.

   Having spoken thus to the adoration of Christ, his last question is
   about his invocation, which he proves from sundry places of Scripture,
   not inquiring into the reasons of it; so that., adding that to the
   former concession of the worship and honour due to him, I shall close
   these considerations with this one syllogism: "He who is to be
   worshipped by angels and men with that divine worship which is due to
   God the Father, and to be prayed unto, called on, believed in, is God
   by nature, blessed for ever; but, according to the confession of Mr B.,
   Jesus Christ is to be worshipped by angels and men with that divine
   worship which is due even to God the Father, and to be prayed unto:
   therefore is he God by nature, over all, blessed for ever." The
   inference of the major proposition I shall farther confirm in the
   ensuing considerations of the worship that is ascribed to Jesus Christ
   in the Scripture.

   In the endeavour of Faustus Socinus to set up a new religion, there was
   not any thing wherein he was more opposed, or wherewith he was more
   exercised by the men of the same design with himself, than in this,
   about the worship and invocation of Jesus Christ. He and his uncle
   Lælius urging amongst others this proposition, "That Christ was not
   God," Franciscus David, Budæus, Christianus Franken, Palæologus, with
   others, made the conclusion that he was not to be worshipped as God,
   nor called upon. With some of these he had sundry disputes and
   conferences, and was miserably intricated by them, being unable to
   defend his opinion upon his hypothesis of the person of Christ. That
   Christ is to be worshipped and invocated, indeed, he proves well and
   learnedly, as in many places, so especially in his third epistle to
   Matthias Radecius; but coming to knit his arguments to his other
   opinion concerning Christ, he was perpetually gravelled, as more
   especially it befell him in his dispute with Christianus Franken, anno
   1584, as is evident in what is extant of that dispute, written by
   Socinus himself. Of the chief argument insisted on by Franken I shall
   speak afterward: see "Disput. cum Franken," pp. 24, 25, 28, 35, etc.
   Against Franciscus David he wrote a peculiar tract, and to him an
   epistle, to prove that the words of Thomas, "My Lord and my God," were
   spoken of Christ, and therefore he was to be worshipped (Epist. p.
   186); wherein he positively affirms that there was no other reading of
   the words (as David vainly pretended) but what is the common use,
   because Erasmus made mention of no such thing, who would not have
   omitted it could he have made any discovery thereof, being justly
   supposed to be no good friend to the Trinity. [403] That men may know
   what to judge of some of his annotations, as well as those of Grotius,
   who walks in the same paths, is this remarked. Wherefore he and his
   associates rejected this Franciscus David afterward as a detestable
   heretic, and utterly deserted him when he was cast into prison by the
   prince of Transylvania, where he died miserably, raving and crying out
   that the devils expected and waited for his company in his journey
   which he had to go (Florim. Rem lib. iv. cap. xii.); the account
   whereof Smalcius also gives us in his refutation of Franzius, Theses de
   Hypocrit. disput. 9, p. 298. [404]

   After these stirs and disputations, it grew the common tenet of Socinus
   and his followers (see his epistle to Enjedinus) that those who denied
   that Christ was to be worshipped and invocated were not to be accounted
   Christians (which how well it agrees with other of his assertions shall
   instantly be seen). So Socinus himself leads the way, Respon. ad
   Niemojevium, Ep. i.; who is followed by Volkelius. [405] "Unless,"
   saith he, "we dare to call on the name of Christ, we should not be
   worthy of the name of Christians." [406] And he is attended by the
   Racovian Catechism, De præcept. Christi, cap. i., whose author affirms
   plainly that he esteemed them not Christians who worshipped him not,
   and accounted that indeed they had not Christ, however in word they
   durst not deny him. [407]

   And of the rest the same is the judgment; but yet with what consistency
   with what they also affirm concerning this invocation of Christ, we
   shall now briefly consider.

   Socinus, in his third epistle to Matthias Radecius, whom he everywhere
   speaks honourably of, and calls him "excellent man," "friend,"
   "brother," and "much-to-be-observed lord" [408] (because he was a great
   man), who yet denied and opposed this invocation of Christ, lays this
   down in the entrance of his discourse, that there is nothing of greater
   moment in Christian religion than the demonstration of this, "That
   invocation and adoration, or divine worship, do agree to Christ,
   although he be a created thing." [409] And in the following words he
   gives you the reason of the importance of the proof of this assertion,
   namely, "Because the Trinitarians' main strength and argument lies in
   this, that adoration and invocation are due to Christ, which are proper
   only to the most high God." [410] Which makes me bold on the other side
   to affirm, that there is nothing in Christian religion more clear, nor
   more needful to be confirmed, than this, that divine worship neither
   is, can, nor ought, by the will of God, to be ascribed to any who by
   nature is not God, to any that is a mere creature, of what dignity,
   power, and authority soever. But yet now, when this zealous champion
   for the invocation of Christ comes to prove his assertion, being
   utterly destitute of the use of that which is the sure bottom and
   foundation thereof, he dares go no farther, but only says that we may
   call upon Christ if we will, but for any precept making it neccessary
   so to do, that he says there is none.

   And therefore he distinguisheth between the adoration of Christ and his
   invocation. [411] For the first, he affirms that it is commanded, or at
   least that things are so ordered that we ought to adore him; but of the
   latter, says he, "There is no precept, only we may do so if we will."
   The same he had before affirmed in his answer to Franciscus David.
   [412] Yea, in the same discourse he affirms, that "if we have so much
   faith as that we can go with confidence to God without him, we need not
   invocate Christ." [413] "We may," saith he, "invocate Christ; but we
   are not bound so to do." Whence Niemojevius falls upon him, and tells
   him that he had utterly spoiled their cause by that concession; [414]
   to deliver himself from which charge, how pitifully he intricates
   himself may be seen in his answer to that epistle. Now, whether this
   man hath sufficient cause to exclude any from being Christians for the
   non-performance of that which himself dares not affirm that they ought
   to do, and with what consistency of principles these things are
   affirmed, is easy to judge.

   Of the same judgment with him is Volk. de Vera Relig. lib. iv. cap. xi.
   de Christi invocatione, Schlichting. ad Meisner., pp. 206, 207, and
   generally the rest of them; which again how consistent it is with what
   they affirm in the Racovian Catechism, -- namely, that this is an
   addition which Jesus Christ hath made to the first commandment, that he
   himself is to be acknowledged a God, to whom we are bound to yield
   divine honour, [415] -- I see not; for if this be added to the first
   commandment, that we should worship him as God, it is scarce,
   doubtless, at our liberty to call upon him or no. Of the same mind is
   Smalcius, De Divinitate Jesu Christi, -- a book that he offered to
   Sigismund III., king of Poland, by the means of Jacobus Sienienska,
   palatine of Podolia, in the year 1608; who, in his epistle to the king,
   calls him his pastor. [416] And yet the same person doth, in another
   place of the same treatise, most bitterly inveigh against them who will
   not worship nor invocate Christ, affirming that they are worse than the
   Trinitarians themselves, [417] -- than which, it seems, he could invent
   nothing more vile to compare them with, -- and yet again [he says] that
   there is no precept that he should be invocated, Cat. Rac. (that is,
   the same person with the former), cap. v. De præcep. Christi, quæ legem
   prefecerunt. [418] So also Ostorodius, Compendiolum Doctrinæ Ecclesiæ
   Christianæ nunc in Polonia potissimum fiorentis, cap. I. sect. 2.

   It is, then, on all hands concluded that Jesus Christ is to be
   worshipped with divine and religious worship, due to God only.

   Fixing this as a common and indisputable principle, I shall subjoin and
   prove these two assertions:-- 1. In general, Divine worship is not to
   be ascribed to any that is not God by nature, who is not partaker of
   the divine essence and being. 2. In particular, Jesus Christ is not to
   be worshipped on the account of the power and authority which he hath
   received from God as mediator, but solely on the account of his being
   "God, blessed for ever." [419] And this is all that is required in
   answer to this tenth chapter of Mr B. What follows on the heads
   mentioned is for the farther satisfaction of the reader in these things
   upon the occasion administered, and for his assistance to the obviating
   of some other Socinian sophisms that he may meet withal. I shall be
   brief in them both.

   For the first, Divine worship is not to be ascribed to them whom God
   will certainly destroy. He will not have us to worship them whom
   himself hateth But, now, all gods that have not made the heavens and
   the earth he will destroy from under these heavens: Jer. x. 11, "Thus
   shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the
   earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these
   heavens." It is a thing that God would have the nations take notice of,
   and therefore is it written in the Chaldee dialect in the original,
   that they who were principally concerned in those days might take the
   more notice of it. And it is an instruction that God put into the
   mouths of the meanest of his people, that they should say it to them:
   "Say ye to them." And the assertion is universal, to all whomsoever
   that have not made the heavens and earth, -- and so is applicable to
   the Socinians' Christ. A god they say he is, as Elijah said of Baal, 1
   Kings xviii. 27; he is made so: but that he made the heavens and earth
   they deny; and therefore he is so far from having any right to be
   worshipped, that God hath threatened he shall be destroyed.

   Again; the apostle reckons it among the sins of the Gentiles that "they
   worshipped them who by nature were no gods," Gal. iv. 8, [420] from
   which we are delivered by the knowledge of God in the gospel And the
   weight of the apostle's assertion of the sin of the Gentiles lies in
   this, that by nature they were not gods who were worshipped. So that
   this is a thing indispensable, that divine worship should not be given
   to any who is not God by nature; and surely we are not called in the
   gospel to the practice of that which is the greatest sin of the
   heathens, that know not God. And to manifest that this is a thing which
   the law of nature gives direction in, not depending on institution,
   Rom. i., it is reckoned among those sins which are against the light of
   nature. They "worshipped the creature" (besides, or) "more than" (or
   with) "the Creator," [421] verse 25, "who is God, blessed for
   evermore." To worship a creature, him who is not the Creator, God,
   blessed for ever, is that idolatry which is condemned in the Gentiles
   as a sin against the light of nature; which to commit God cannot (be it
   spoken with reverence!) dispense with the sons of men (for he cannot
   deny himself), much less institute and appoint them so to do. [422] It
   being, then, on all hands confessed that Christ is to be worshipped
   with divine or religious worship, it will be easy to make the
   conclusion that he is God by nature, blessed for evermore.

   That also is general and indispensable which you have, Jer. xvii. 5, 6,
   "Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and
   whose heart departeth from the Lord. For he shall be like the heath in
   the desert, and shall not see when good cometh." That which we worship
   with divine worship we trust in, and make it our arm and strength. And
   these words, "And whose heart departeth from the Lord," are not so much
   an addition to what is before cursed as a declaration of it. All trust
   in man, who is no more but so, with that kind of trust wherewith we
   trust in Jehovah (as by the antithesis, verse 7, is evident that it is
   intended), is here cursed. If Christ be only a man by nature, however
   exalted and invested with authority, yet to trust in him as we trust in
   Jehovah, -- which we do if we worship him with divine worship, --
   would, by this rule, be denounced a cursed thing.

   Rev. xix. 10, xxii. 8, 9, do add the command of God to the general
   reason insisted on in the places before mentioned: "I fell at his feet
   to worship him. And he said, See thou do it not: for I am thy
   fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus:
   worship God." So again, chap. xxii. 9. There are evidently two reasons
   assigned by the angel why John ought not to worship him:-- 1. Because
   he was a servant. He that is a servant of God, and is no more, is not
   to be worshipped. Now, he that is not God at his best estate, however
   exalted, is but a servant in respect of God, and a fellow-servant of
   the saints, and no more, chap. vi. 11. All his creatures serve him, and
   for his will they were made. Such and no other is the Socinians'
   Christ, who is clearly deprived of all worship by this prohibition and
   reason of it. 2. From the command, and the natural and eternal
   obligation of it, in these repeated words, To Theo prokuneson. [423] It
   is the word of the law that our Saviour himself insists on, Matt. iv.
   10, that is here repeated; and the force of the angel's reason for the
   strengthening his prohibition, is from hence, that no other but he who
   is God, that God intended by the law and by our Saviour, Matt. iv., is
   to be worshipped. For if the intendment of the words were only
   positive, that God is to be worshipped, and did not also at the same
   time exclude every one whatever from all divine worship who is not that
   God, they would be of no force for the reproof of John in his attempt
   to worship the angel nor have any influence into his prohibition. And
   thus that angel, who, chap. v. 9-13, shows John all creatures in heaven
   and on earth yielding divine worship and adoration to the Lamb, the
   Lord Jesus Christ, in the close of all appropriates all that worship to
   God himself alone, and for ever shuts out the most glorious creature
   from our thoughts and intentions in the performance of any divine
   worship or religious adoration.

   And it may hence appear how vain is that plea of the adversaries, to
   avoid the force of this reproof, which is managed by Schlichtingius
   against Meisnerus. "To those places," saith he, "where mention is made
   of God as alone to be worshipped, I answer, that by those exclusive
   particles, alone,' and the like, when they are used of God, they are
   not simply excluded who depend on God in that thing which is treated
   of. So is he said to be only wise, only powerful, only immortal, and
   yet those who are made partakers of them from God ought not simply to
   be excluded from wisdom, power, and immortality. Wherefore, when it is
   said that God alone is to be worshipped and adored, he ought not to be
   simply excluded who herein dependeth on God, because of that divine
   rule over all which he hath of him received, yea, he is rather
   included." [424] So the most learned of that tribe. But, --

   1. By this rule nothing is appropriated unto God, nor any thing
   excluded from a participation with him, by that particle mentioned: and
   wherever any thing is said of God only, we are to understand it of God
   and others; for on him, in all things, do all other things depend.

   2. When it is said that God only is wise, etc., though it doth not
   absolutely deny that any other may be wise with that wisdom which is
   proper to them, yet it absolutely denies that any one partakes with God
   in his wisdom, -- is wise as God is wise, with that kind of wisdom
   wherewith God is wise. And so where it is said that God only is to be
   worshipped and honoured, though it doth not exclude all others from any
   kind of worship and honour, but that they may have that which is due to
   them by God's appointment, from their excellency and pre-eminence, yet
   it doth absolutely exclude any from being worshipped with divine
   worship; that is due and proper to God.

   3. We shall show afterward that whatever dignity, rule, and dominion
   they say is given to Christ, and whatever excellency in him doth thence
   arise, yet it is quite of another kind, and stands upon another foot of
   account, than that essential excellency that is in God; and so cannot
   nor doth require the same kind of worship as is due to God.

   4. Angels and men are depending on God in authority and power, and
   therefore, if this rule be true, they are not excluded from divine and
   religious worship in the command of worshipping God only; and so they
   may be worshipped with divine and religious adoration and invocation as
   well as Jesus Christ. Neither is it any thing but a mere begging of the
   thing in question, to say that it is divine power that is delegated to
   Christ, which that is not that is delegated to angels and men. That
   power which is properly divine and the formal cause of divine worship
   is incommunicable, nor can be delegated, nor is in any who is not
   essentially God. So that the power of Christ and angels being of the
   same kind, though his be more and greater than theirs as to degrees,
   they are to be worshipped with the same kind of worship, though he may
   be worshipped more than they.

   5. This is the substance of Schlichtingius' rule, "When any thing is
   affirmed of God exclusively to others, -- indeed others are not
   excluded, but included"!

   6. We argue not only from the exclusive particle, but from the nature
   of the thing itself. So that, this pretended rule and exception
   notwithstanding, all and every thing whatever that is not God is by God
   himself everlastingly excluded from the least share in divine or
   religious worship, with express condemnation of them who assign it to
   them.

   The same evasion with that insisted on by Schlichtingius, Socinus
   himself had before used, who professes that this is the bottom and
   foundation of all his arguments in his disputation with Franciscus
   David about the invocation of Christ, that others as well as God may be
   worshipped and invocated, in his third epistle to Volkelius, where he
   labours to answer the objection of John's praying for grace from "the
   seven spirits that are before the throne of Christ," Rev. i. 4, "But
   why, I pray, is it absurd to affirm that those seven spirits (supposing
   them mere creatures) were invocated of John? Is it because God alone is
   to be invocated? But that this reason is of no value that whole
   disputation doth demonstrate, not only because it is nowhere forbidden
   that we should invocate any other but God" (os durum), "but also, and
   much rather, because those interdictions never exclude those who are
   subordinate to God himself." [425] That is, as was observed before,
   they exclude none at all; for all creatures whatever are subordinate to
   God. To say that they are subordinate as to this end, that under him
   they may be worshipped, is purely to beg the question. We deny that any
   is or may be in such a subordination to God. And the reasons the man
   adds of this his assertion contain the grand plea of all idolaters,
   heathenish and antichristian: "Whatever is given to them," saith he,
   "who are in that subordination is given to God." [426] So said the
   Pagans of old, so say the Papists at this day; all redounds to the
   glory of God, when they worship stocks and stones, because he appoints
   them so to do. And so said the Israelites when they worshipped the
   golden calf: "It is a feast to Jehovah." But if John might worship and
   invocate (which is the highest act of worship) the seven spirits, Rev.
   i. 4, because of their subordination to God, supposing them to be so
   many created spirits, why might he not as well worship the spirit or
   angel in the end of the book, chap. xxii. 8, 9, who was no less
   subordinate to God? Was the matter so altered during his visions, that
   whom he might invocate in the entrance he might not so much as worship
   in the close?

   The Racovian Catechism takes another course, and tells you that the
   foundation of the worship and adoration of Christ is because "Christ
   had added to the first commandment that we should acknowledge him for
   God;" [427] that is, he who hath divine authority over us, to whom we
   are bound to yield divine honour. But, -- 1. That Jesus Christ, who is
   not God by nature, did add to the command of God that he himself should
   be acknowledged God, is intolerable blasphemy, asserted without the
   least colour or pretence from the Scripture, and opens a door to
   downright atheism. 2. The exposition of his being God, that is, one who
   hath divine authority over us, is false. God is a name of nature, not
   of office and power, Gal. iv. 8. 3. Christ was worshipped, and
   commanded to be worshipped, before his coming in the flesh, Ps. ii. 12;
   Gen. xlviii. 16; Exod. xxiii. 21.

   But if this be added to the first commandment, that Christ be
   worshipped as God, then is he to be worshipped with the worship
   required in the first commandment. Now, this worship is that which is
   proper to the only true God, as the very words of it import, "Thou
   shalt have no other gods before me." How, then, will Smalcius reconcile
   himself with his master, who plainly affirms that Jesus Christ is not
   to be worshipped with that divine worship which is due to God alone,
   and strives to answer that place of John v. 23 to the contrary, that
   "all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father?" [428]
   That Christ should be commanded to be worshipped in the first
   commandment (or by an addition made thereto), which commands us to have
   only one God, and not be worshipped with the worship which is due to
   that one God, is one of the mysteries of these men's religion. But to
   proceed:--

   Where the formal cause of divine worship is not, there divine worship
   ought not to be exhibited; but in no creature there is, nor can be, the
   formal cause of divine worship: therefore no creature, who is only
   such, can be worshipped without idolatry. The formal reason of any
   thing is but one; the reason of all worship is excellency or
   pre-eminence. The reason of divine or religious worship is divine
   pre-eminence and excellency. Now, divine excellency and pre-eminence is
   peculiar unto the divine nature. Wherein is it that God is so
   infinitely excellent above all creatures? Is it not from his infinitely
   good and incomprehensible nature? Now, look what difference there is
   between the essence of the Creator and the creature, the same is
   between their excellency. Let a creature be exalted to ever so great a
   height of dignity and excellency, yet his dignity is not at all nigher
   to the dignity and excellency of God, because there is no proportion
   between that which is infinite and that which is finite and limited.
   If, then, excellency and pre-eminence be the cause of worship, and the
   distance between the excellency of God and that of the most excellent
   and most highly-advanced creature be infinite, it is impossible that
   the respect and worship due to them should be of the same kind. Now, it
   is religious or divine adoration that is due to God, whereof the
   excellency of his nature is the formal cause: this, then, cannot be
   ascribed to any other; -- and to whomsoever it is ascribed, thereby do
   we acknowledge to be in him all divine perfections; which, if he be not
   God by nature, is gross idolatry. In sum, adorability, if I may so say,
   is an absolute, incommunicable property of God; adoration thence
   arising, a respect that relates to him only.

   I shall, for a close of this chapter, proceed to manifest that Christ
   himself is not by us worshipped under any other formal reason but as he
   is God; which will add some light to what hath already been spoken. And
   here, lest there should be any mistake among the meanest in a matter of
   so great consequence, I shall deliver my thoughts to the whole of the
   worship of Christ in the ensuing observations:--

   1. Jesus Christ, the mediator, being Theanthropos, God and man, the Son
   of God having assumed to gennomenon hagion, Luke i. 35, "that holy
   thing" that was born of the Virgin, anupostaton, having no subsistence
   of its own, into personal subsistence with himself, is to be worshipped
   with divine, religious worship, even as the Father. By "worshipped with
   divine worship," I mean believed in, hoped in, trusted in, invocated as
   God, as an independent fountain of all good, and a sovereign disposer
   of all our present and everlasting concernments: by doing whereof we
   acknowledge in him, and ascribe to him, all divine perfections, --
   omnipotency, omniscience, infinite goodness, omnipresence, and the
   like.

   This proposition was sufficiently confirmed before. In the Revelation
   you have the most solemn representation of the divine, spiritual
   worship of the church, both that militant in the earth and that
   triumphant in the heavens; and by both is the worship mentioned given
   to the Mediator: "Unto him" (to Jesus Christ) "that loved us, and
   washed us from our sins in his own blood, be glory and dominion for
   ever and ever, Amen," chap. i. 5, 6. So again, the same church,
   represented by four living creatures and twenty-four elders, falls down
   before the Lamb, chap. v. 8, 12, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
   receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and
   glory, and blessing;" and, verse 13, joint worship is given to him who
   sits upon the throne and to the Lamb by the whole creation, "And every
   creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and
   such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
   Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth
   upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever," etc. And this
   also is particularly done by the church triumphant, chap. vii. 9, 10.
   Now, the Lamb is neither Christ in respect of the divine nature nor
   Christ in respect of the human nature, but it is Christ the mediator.
   That Christ was mediator in respect of both natures shall in due time
   be demonstrated. It is, then, the person of the mediator, God and man,
   who is the "Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world," to whom
   all this honour and worship is ascribed. This the apostle perfectly
   confirms, Rom. xiv. 8-11, "Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and
   whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or
   die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and
   revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. But why
   dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy
   brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ. For
   it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,
   and every tongue shall confess to God." To Christ, exalted in his
   dominion and sovereignty, we live and die; to him do we bow the knee
   and confess, that is, perform all worship, and stand before him, as at
   his disposal; we swear by him; -- as in the place from whence these
   words are taken.

   2. That our religious, divine, and spiritual worship, hath a double or
   twofold respect unto Jesus Christ: [429] -- (1.) As he is the ultimate
   formal object of our worship, being God, to be blessed for evermore, as
   was before declared. (2.) As the way, means, and cause, of all the good
   we receive from God in our religious approach to him.

   In the first sense, we call upon the name of Christ, 1 Cor. i. 2: in
   the other, we ask the Father in his name, according to his command,
   John xvi. 23. In the first, we respect him as one with the Father, as
   one who thinks it no robbery to be equal with him, Phil. ii. 6; the
   "fellow of the Lord of hosts," Zech. xiii. 7: in the other, as one that
   doth intercede yet with the Father, Heb. vii. 25, praying him yet to
   send the Comforter to us, being yet, in that regard, less than the
   Father; and in which respect as he is our head, so God is his head, as
   the apostle tells us, 1 Cor. xi. 3, "The head of every man" (that is,
   every believer) "is Christ, and the head of Christ is God." In this
   sense is he the way whereby we go to the Father, John xiv. 6; and
   through him we have an access to the Father, Eph. ii. 18, Dia Christou
   pros ton Patera. In our worship, with our faith, love, hope, trust, and
   prayers, we have an access to God. Thus, in our approach to the throne
   of grace, we look upon Christ as the high priest over the house of God,
   Heb. iv. 14-16, by whom we have admission, who offers up our prayers
   and supplications for us, Rev. viii. 3. In this state, as he is the
   head of angels and of his whole church, so is he in subordination to
   the Father; and therefore he is said at the same time to receive
   revelations from the Father, and to send an angel as his servant on his
   work and employment, Rev. i. 1. And thus is he our advocate with the
   Father, 1 John ii. 1. In this respect, then, seeing that in our access
   to God, even the Father, as the Father of him and his, John xx. 17,
   with our worship, homage, service, our faith, love, hope, confidence,
   and supplications, eyeing Christ as our mediator, advocate,
   intercessor, upon whose account we are accepted, for whose sake we are
   pardoned, through whom we have admission to God, and by whom we have
   help and assistance in all that we have to do with God; it is evident,
   I say, that in this respect he is not eyed nor addressed to in our
   worship as the ultimate, adequate, formal object of it, but as the
   meritorious cause of our approach and acceptance, and so of great
   consideration therein And therefore, whereas, Rom. iii. 25, it is said
   that "God hath set him forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
   blood," it is not intended that faith fixes on his blood or
   blood-shedding, or on him as shedding his blood, as the prime object of
   it, but as the meritorious cause of our forgiveness of sin, through the
   righteousness of God.

   And these two distinct respects have we to Jesus Christ, our mediator,
   who is Theanthropos, God and man, in our religious worship, and all
   acts of communion with him: As one with the Father, we honour him,
   believe in him, worship him, as we do the Father; [430] as mediator,
   depending on the Father, in subordination to him, so our faith regards
   him, we love him and hope in him, as the way, means, and meritorious
   cause, of our acceptance with the Father. And in both these respects we
   have distinct communion with him.

   3. That Jesus Christ, our mediator, Theanthropos, God and man, who is
   to be worshipped with divine or religious worship, is to be so
   worshipped because he is our mediator. That is, his mediation is the
   "ratio quia," an unconquerable reason and argument, why we ought to
   love him, fear him, believe in him, call upon him, and worship him in
   general. This is the reason still urged by the Holy Ghost why we ought
   to worship him: Rev. i. 5, 6, "Unto him that loved us, and washed us
   from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto
   God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever."
   Who would not love him, who would not ascribe honour to him, who hath
   so loved us and washed us in his own blood So Rev. v. 12, there is an
   acknowledgment of the power, riches, goodness, wisdom, strength, glory,
   and blessing, that belong to him, because as the Lamb, as Mediator, he
   hath done so great things for us. And, I dare say, there is none of his
   redeemed ones who finds not the power of this motive upon his heart.
   The love of Christ in his mediation, the work he has gone through in
   it, and that which he continueth in, the benefits we receive thereby,
   and our everlasting misery without it, are all chains upon our souls to
   bind us to the Lord Christ in faith, love, and obedience. [431] But yet
   this mediation of Christ is not the formal and fundamental cause of our
   worship (as shall be showed), but only a motive thereunto. It is not
   the "ratio formalis, et fundamentalis cultus," but only the "ratio
   quia," or an argument thereunto. Thus God dealing with his people, and
   exhorting them of old to worship and obedience, he says, "I am the Lord
   thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the
   house of bondage: thou shalt have no other gods before me," Exod. xx.
   2, 3. He makes his benefit of bringing them out of the land of Egypt
   the reason of that eternally indispensable moral worship which he
   requires in the first commandment: not that that was the formal cause
   of that worship, for God is to be worshipped as the first, sovereign,
   independent good, as the absolute Lord of all and fountain of all good,
   whether he gives any such benefits or no; but yet all his mercies, all
   his benefits, every thing he doth for us in his providence and in his
   grace, as to the things of this life or of another, are all arguments
   and motives to press us to the performance of all that worship and
   service which we owe unto him as our God and Creator. "Bless the Lord,
   O my soul, and forget not all his benefits," saith David, Ps. ciii. 1,
   2. So is it in the case of our mediator. For the work of his mediation
   we are eternally obliged to render all glory, honour, and thanksgiving
   to him; but yet his mediation is not the formal cause thereof, but only
   an invincible motive thereunto. Let this, therefore, be our fourth and
   last observation:--

   4. Though Jesus Christ, who is our mediator, God and man, is to be
   worshipped with divine worship, even as we honour the Father, yet this
   is not as he is mediator, but as he is God, blessed for evermore. He is
   not to be worshipped under this reduplication as mediator, though he
   who is mediator is to be worshipped, and he is to be worshipped because
   he is mediator. That is, his mediatory office is not the formal cause
   and reason of yielding divine worship to him, nor under that
   consideration is that worship ultimately terminated in him. The formal
   reason of any thing, strictly taken, is but one, and it is that from
   the concession whereof that thing or effect whereof it is the cause or
   reason, without any other help, doth arise or result from it. Now, the
   formal cause or reason of all divine worship is the deity or divine
   nature; -- that being granted, divine worship necessarily follows to be
   due; that being denied, that worship also is, and is to be for ever,
   denied. We may not worship them who by nature are not God. If it could
   be supposed that we might have had a mediator that should not have been
   God (which was impossible), religious worship would not have been
   yielded to him; and if the Son of God had never been our mediator, yet
   he was to be worshipped.

   It is the deity of Christ, then, which is the fundamental, formal cause
   and reason, and the proper object, of our worship: [432] for that being
   granted, though we had no other reason or argument for it, yet we ought
   to worship him; and that being denied, all other reasons and motives
   whatever would not be a sufficient cause or warrant for any such
   proceeding.

   It is true, Christ hath a power given him of his Father above all
   angels, principalities, and powers, called "All power in heaven and in
   earth," Matt. xxviii. 18, and "a name above every name," Phil. ii. 9,
   giving him an excellency, an axia, as he is mesites hiketes, as he is
   the king and head of his church, which is to be acknowledged, owned,
   ascribed to him; and the consideration whereof, with his ability and
   willingness therein to succour, relieve, and save us to the uttermost,
   in a way of mediation, is a powerful, effectual motive (as was said
   before) to his worship: but yet this is an excellency which is distinct
   from that which is purely and properly divine, and so cannot be the
   formal reason of religious worship. Excellency is the cause of honour;
   every distinct excellency and eminence is the cause of honour; every
   distinct excellency and eminence is the cause of distinct honour and
   worship. Now, what excellency or dignity soever is communicated by a
   way of delegation is distinct and of another kind from that which is
   original, infinite, and communicating, and therefore cannot be the
   formal cause of the same honour and worship.

   I shall briefly give the reasons of the assertion insisted on, and so
   pass on to what remains.

   1. The first is taken from the nature of divine or religious worship.
   It is that whereby we ascribe the honour and glory of all infinite
   perfections to him whom we so worship, -- to be the first cause, the
   fountain of all good, independent, infinitely wise, powerful,
   all-sufficient, almighty, all-seeing, omnipotent, eternal, the only
   rewarder; as such we submit ourselves to him religiously, in faith,
   love, obedience, adoration, and invocation. But now we cannot ascribe
   these divine excellencies and perfections unto Christ as mediator, for
   then his mediation should be the reason why he is all this, which it is
   not; but it is from his divine nature alone that so he is, and
   therefore thence alone is it that he is so worshipped.

   2. Christ under this formal conception, as they speak, as mediator, is
   not God; but under this, as partaker of the nature of God. Christ as
   mediator is an expression, as they speak, in the concrete, whose form
   is its abstract. Now, that is his mediation or mediatory office; and
   therefore if Christ under this formal conception of a mediator be God,
   his mediatory office and God must be the same, which is false and
   absurd: therefore as such, or on that fundamental account, he is not
   worshipped with divine worship.

   3. Christ in respect of his mediation dependeth on God, and hath all
   his power committed to him from God: Matt. xi. 27, "All things," saith
   he, "are delivered unto me of my Father;" and chap. xxviii. 18, "All
   power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;" John xvii. 2, "Thou
   hast given him power over all flesh;" and in innumerable other places
   is the same testified. God gives him as mediator his name, -- that is,
   his authority. Now, God is worshipped because he is independent: he is,
   and there is none besides him; he is Alpha and Omega, -- the first and
   the last. And if the reason why we worship God with divine worship be
   because he is autarkes and independent, certainly that wherein Christ
   is dependent and in subordination to him, as receiving it from him,
   cannot be the formal cause of attributing divine worship to him.

   4. Christ in respect of his divine nature is "equal with God," that is,
   the Father, Phil. ii. 6; but in respect of his mediation he is not
   equal to him, he is less than he. "My Father," saith he, "is greater
   than I," John xiv. 28. Now, whatever is less than God, is not equal to
   him, is infinitely so; for between God and that which is not God there
   is no proportion, neither in being nor excellency. That Christ in
   respect of his office is not equal to God is commonly received in that
   axiom, whereby the arguments thence taken against his deity are
   answered, "Inæqualitas officii non tollit æqualitatem naturæ." Now,
   certainly, that which is infinitely unequal to God cannot be the formal
   cause of that worship which we yield to him as God.

   5. That which shall cease and is not absolutely eternal cannot be the
   formal cause of our worship, for the formal reason of worship can no
   more cease than God can cease to be God; for when that ceaseth, we
   cease to worship him, which while he is the Creator and sovereign Lord
   of his creatures cannot be. Now, that the mediatory office of Christ
   shall cease the Holy Ghost affirmeth, 1 Cor. xv. 24, "Then cometh the
   end," etc. He then gives up his kingdom to God. And there is the same
   reason from the other parts of his mediatory office. It is true,
   indeed, the efficacy of his office abideth to eternity, whilst the
   redeemed ones live with God and praise him; but as to the
   administration of his office, that ceaseth when at the last day, the
   whole work of it shall be perfectly consummated, and he hath saved to
   the uttermost all that come to God by him.

   The sum of all is: Jesus Christ, God and man, our mediator, who is to
   be worshipped in all things and invocated as the Father, and whom we
   ought night and day to honour, praise, love, and adore, because of his
   mediation and the office of it, which for our sakes he hath undertaken,
   is so to be honoured and worshipped, not as mediator, exalted of God,
   and intrusted with all power and dignity from him, but as being equal
   with him, God, to be blessed for ever, his divine nature being the
   fundamental, formal reason of that worship, and proper ultimate object
   of it. And to close up this digression, there is not any thing that
   more sharply and severely cuts the throat of the whole sophistical plea
   of the Socinians against the deity of Christ than this one observation.
   Themselves acknowledge that Christ is to be worshipped with religious
   worship, and his name to be invocated, denying to account them
   Christians, whatever they are, who are otherwise minded, as Franciscus
   David and those before mentioned were. Now, if there be no possible
   reason to be assigned as the formal cause of this worship but his
   deity, they must either acknowledge him to be God or deny themselves to
   be Christians.

   Some directions, by the way, may be given from that which hath been
   spoken as to the guidance of our souls in the worship of God, or in our
   addresses to the throne of grace by Jesus Christ. What God hath
   discovered of himself unto us, he would have us act faith upon in all
   that we have to deal with him in. By this we are assured we worship the
   true God, and not an idol, when we worship him who has revealed himself
   in his word, and as he has revealed himself. Now, God hath declared
   himself to be three in one; for it is written, "There are three that
   bear record in heaven, and these three are one," 1 John v. 7. So, then,
   is he to be worshipped. And not only so, but the order of the three
   persons in that Deity, the eternal, internal order among themselves, is
   revealed to us. The Father is of none, is autautos. The Son is begotten
   of the Father, having the glory of the only-begotten Son of God, and so
   is autotheos in respect of his nature, essence, and being, not in
   respect of his personality, which he hath of the Father. The Spirit is
   of the Father and the Son. He is often so called the Spirit of God and
   the Spirit of the Son. For the term of "proceeding," or "going forth,"
   I profess myself ignorant whether it concern chiefly his eternal
   personality or his dispensation in the work of the gospel. The latter I
   rather like; of which this is no time to give my reasons. But be those
   expressions of what import soever, he is equally the Spirit of the
   Father and the Son, and is of them both and from them both. God, then,
   by us is to be worshipped as he hath revealed the subsistence of the
   three persons in this order, and so are we to deal with him in our
   approaches to him: not that we are to frame any conception in our minds
   of distinct substances, which are not; but by faith closing with this
   revelation of them, we give up our souls in contemplation and
   admiration of that we cannot comprehend.

   2. There is an external economy and dispensation of the persons in
   reference to the work of our salvation, and what we draw nigh to them
   for. So the Father is considered as the foundation of all mercy, grace,
   glory, every thing that is dispensed in the covenant or revealed in the
   gospel, the Son receiving all from him, and the Spirit [being] sent by
   the Son to effect and complete the whole good pleasure of God in us and
   towards us. And in and under the consideration of this economy is God
   of us to be worshipped.

   "All things," saith Christ, "are delivered unto me of my Father," Matt.
   xi. 27 (that is, to me as mediator); therefore "come unto me." And in
   his prayer, John xvii. 8, "I have given unto them the words which thou
   gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I
   came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me." So
   most fully John iii. 34, 35. He is sent of God; and from the love of
   the Father to him as mediator are all things given him. "It pleased the
   Father that in him should all fulness dwell," Col. i. 19; John i. 16.
   John v. 26, "He hath given him to have life," -- that is, as he is
   mediator, appointed him to be the fountain of spiritual life to his
   elect. And Rev. i. 1, the revelation of the will of God is given unto
   Christ by the Father, as to this end of discovering it to the church.

   Hence ariseth the second way of faith's acting itself towards God in
   our worship of him. It eyes the Father as the fountain of this
   dispensation, and the Son as the mediator, as the storehouse, and the
   Spirit as immediate communicator thereof. Here also it considers the
   Son under these two distinct notions:-- first, as the ordinance and
   servant of the Father in the great work of mediation. So it loves him,
   delights in him, and rejoiceth in the wisdom of God in finding out and
   giving such a means of life, salvation, and union with himself; and so
   by Christ believes in God, even the Father. It considers him, secondly,
   as the way of going to the Father; and there it rests, as the ultimate
   object of all the religious actings of the soul So we are very often
   said through and by Christ to believe in God, and by him to have an
   access to God and an entrance to the throne of grace. In this sense, I
   say, when we draw nigh to God in any religious worship, yea, in all the
   first actings and movings of our souls towards him in faith and love,
   the Lord Christ is considered as mediator, as clothed with his offices,
   as doing the will of the Father, as serving the design of his love; and
   so the soul is immediately fixed on God through Christ, being
   strengthened, supported, and sustained, by the consideration of Christ
   as the only procuring cause of all the good things we seek from God,
   and of our interest in those excellencies which are in him, which make
   him excellent to us.

   And this is the general consideration that faith hath of Christ in all
   our dealings with God. We "ask in his name," "for his sake," go to God
   "on his account," "through him," and the like; are strengthened and
   emboldened upon the interest of him as our high priest and intercessor;
   God the Father being yet always immediately in our eye as the primary
   object of our worship. But yet now again, this Christ as mediator, so
   sent and intrusted by the Father, as above, is also one with the
   Father, God, to be blessed for evermore. Faith also takes in this
   consideration; and so he who before was the means of fixing our faith
   on God is thereupon become the proper object of our faith himself. We
   believe in him, invocate, call upon him, worship him, put our trust in
   him, and live unto him. Over and above, then, the distinction that the
   eternal persons have in the manner of in-being in the same essence,
   which also is the object of our faith, that distinction which they have
   in the external economy is to be considered in our religious worship of
   God; -- and herein is Christ partly eyed as the Father's servant, the
   means and cause of all our communion with God, and so is the medium of
   our worship, not the object; partly as God and man vested with that
   office, and so he is the primary and ultimate object of it also. And
   this may give us, I say, some assistance to order our thoughts aright
   towards God, and some light into that variety of expressions which we
   have in Scripture about worshipping of God in Christ, and worshipping
   of Christ also. So is it in respect of the Spirit.

   Having cleared the whole matter under consideration, it may be worth
   the while a little to consider the condition of our adversaries in
   reference to this business, wherein, of all other things, as I said
   before, they are most entangled. Of the contests and disputes of
   Socinus with Franciscus David about this business, I have given the
   reader an account formerly, and of the little success he had therein.
   The man would fain have stood when he had kicked away the ground from
   under his feet, but was not able. And never was he more shamefully
   gravelled in any dispute than in that which he had with Christianus
   Franken about this business, whereof I shall give the reader a brief
   account.

   This Franken seems to have been a subtile fellow, who, denying with
   Socinus that Christ was God, saw evidently that it was impossible to
   find out a foundation of yielding religious worship or adoration unto
   him. With him about this matter Socinus had a solemn dispute in the
   house of one Paulicovius, anno 1584, March 14. [433] Franken in this
   disputation was the opponent, and his first argument is this: "Look how
   great distance there is between the Creator and the creature, so great
   ought the difference to be between the honour that is exhibited to the
   one and the other. But between the Creator and the creature there is
   the greatest difference, whether you respect nature and essence, or
   dignity and excellency; and therefore there ought to be the greatest
   difference between the honour of the Creator and the creature. But the
   honour that chiefly is due to God is religious worship; therefore this
   is not to be given to a creature, therefore not to Christ, whom you
   confess to be a mere creature." [434] This, I say, was his first
   argument. To which Socinus answers: "Although the difference between
   God and the creature be the greatest, yet it doth not follow that the
   difference between their honour must be so; for God can communicate his
   honour to whom he will, especially to Christ, who is worthy of such
   honour, and who is not commanded to be worshipped without weighty
   causes for it." [435]

   But, by the favour of this disputant, God cannot give that honour that
   is due unto him upon the account of his excellency and eminency, as he
   is the first cause of all things and the last end (which is the ground
   of divine worship), to any one who hath not his nature. The honour due
   to God cannot be given to him who is not God. His honour, the honour of
   him as God, is that which is due to him as God. Now, that he should
   give that honour that is due to him as God to him which is not God, is
   utterly impossible and contradictory to itself. We confess that there
   be most weighty causes why Christ should be worshipped, yet but one
   formal reason of that worship we can acknowledge; and therefore when
   Franken had taken off this absurd answer by sundry instances and
   reasons, Socinus is driven to miserable evasions. First, he cries out,
   "I can answer all these testimonies;" [436] to which when the other
   replied, "And I can give a probable answer to all the texts you produce
   arguing the adoration of Christ," [437] being driven to hard shifts, he
   adds, "I am as certain of the truth of my opinion as I am that I hold
   this hat in my hand," [438] -- which is a way of arguing that is
   commonly used by men that have nothing else to say. Wherefore Franken
   laughs at him, and tells him, "Your certainty cannot be a rule of truth
   to me and others, seeing another man may be found that will say he is
   most certain to the contrary opinion." [439] So that, prevailing
   nothing by this means, he is forced to turn the tables; and instead of
   an answer, which he could not give to Franken's argument, to become
   opponent and urge an argument against him. Saith he, "My certainty of
   this thing is as true as it is true that the apostle saith of Christ,
   Let all the angels of God worship him.'?" [440] But, by the favour of
   this disputant, this is not his business. He was to answer Franken's
   argument, whereby he proved that he was not to be worshipped, and not
   to have brought a contrary testimony, which is certainly to be
   interpreted according to the issue of the reason insisted on. And this
   was the end of that first argument between them.

   The next argument of Franken, whereby he brought his adversary to
   another absurdity, had its rise from a distinction given by Socinus
   about a twofold religious worship; -- one kind whereof, without any
   medium, was directed to God; the other is yielded him by Christ as a
   means. The first he says is proper to God, the other belongs to Christ
   only. [441] Now, he is blind that doth not see that, for what he doth
   here to save himself, he doth but beg the thing in question. Who
   granted him that there was a twofold religious worship, -- one of this
   sort, and another of that? Is it a sufficient answer, for a man to
   repeat his own hypothesis to answer an argument lying directly against
   it? He grants, indeed, upon the matter all that Franken desired, --
   namely, that Christ was not to be worshipped with that worship
   wherewith God is worshipped, and consequently not with divine. But
   Franken asks him whether this twofold worship was of the same kind or
   no? [442] to which he answered, that it was because it abode not in
   Christ, but through him passed to God. [443] Upon which, after the
   interposition of another entangling question, the man thus replies unto
   him: "This, then, will follow, that even the image of Christ is to be
   worshipped, because one and the same worship respects the image as the
   means, Christ as the end, as Thomas Aquinas tells us, from whom you
   borrowed your figment." [444] Yet this very fancy Socinus seems
   afterward to illustrate, by taking a book in his hand, sliding it along
   upon a table, showing how it passed by some hands where truly it was,
   but stayed not till it came to the end: for which gross allusion he was
   sufficiently derided by his adversary I shall not insist on the other
   arguments wherewith on his own hypothesis he was miserably gravelled by
   this Franken, and after all his pretence of reason forced to cry out,
   "These are philosophical arguments, and contrary to the gospel." The
   disputation is extant, with the notes of Socinus upon it, for his own
   vindication; which do not indeed one whir mend the matter. And of this
   matter thus far.

Chapter XX.

   Of the priestly office of Christ -- How he was a priest -- When he
   entered on his office -- And how he dischargeth it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Mr Biddle's eleventh chapter examined.

   His eleventh chapter is concerning the priestly office of Jesus Christ.
   In the first and second questions he grants him to be a priest, from
   Heb. iv. 14, and to be appointed to that office by the Father, from
   chap. v. 5. The remainder of the chapter is spent in sundry attempts to
   prove that Christ was not a priest whilst he was on the earth, as also
   to take off from the end of his priesthood, with the benefit redounding
   to the church thereby.

   For the first, a man would suppose Mr Biddle were fair and ingenuous in
   his concessions concerning the priesthood of Jesus Christ. May we but
   be allowed to propose a few questions to him, and to have answers
   suggested according to the analogy of his faith, I suppose his
   acknowledgment of this truth will be found to come exceedingly short of
   what may be expected. Let him, therefore, show whether Christ be a high
   priest properly so called, or only in a metaphorical sense, with
   respect to what he doth in heaven for us, as the high priest of old did
   deal for the people in their things when he received mercy from God.
   Again, whether Christ did or doth offer a proper sacrifice to God; and
   if so, of what kind; or only that his offering of himself in heaven is
   metaphorically so called. If any shall say that Mr B. differs from his
   masters in these things, I must needs profess myself to be otherwise
   minded, because of his following attempt to exclude him from the
   investiture with and execution of his priestly office in this life and
   at his death; whence it inevitably follows that he can in no wise be a
   proper priest, nor have a proper sacrifice to offer, but that both the
   one and the other are metaphorical, and so termed in allusion to what
   the high priest among the Jews did for the people. That which I have to
   speak to in this ensuing discourse, will hinder me from insisting much
   on the demonstration of this, that Christ was a priest so called, and
   offered to God a sacrifice of atonement or propitiation, properly so
   called, whereof all other priests and sacrifices appointed of God were
   but types. Briefly, therefore, I shall do it.

   The Scripture is so positive that Jesus Christ, in the execution of his
   office of mediation, was and is a priest, a high priest, that it is,
   amongst all that acknowledge him, utterly out of question. That he is
   not properly so called, but metaphorically, and in allusion to the high
   priest of the Jews, as was said, the Socinians contend. I shall, then,
   as I said, in the first place, prove that Christ was a high priest
   properly so called, and then evince when he was so, or when he entered
   on that office:--

   1. This first is evident, from that description or definition of a high
   priest which the apostle gives, Heb. v. 1, "Every high priest taken
   from among men is ordained for men, that he may offer both gifts and
   sacrifices for sin." That this is the description of a high priest
   properly so called is manifest from the apostle's accommodation of this
   office spoken of to Aaron, or his exemplifying of the way of entrance
   thereinto from that of Aaron, verse 4, "And no man taketh this honour
   unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron;" that is, to
   be such a high priest as Aaron was, which here he describes, -- one
   that had that honour which Aaron had. Now, certainly Aaron was a high
   priest properly and truly, if ever any one was so in the world. That
   Jesus Christ was such a high priest as is here described, yea, that he
   is the very high priest so described by the Holy Ghost, appears upon
   this twofold consideration:--

   (1.) In general, the apostle accommodates this definition or
   description of a high priest to Jesus Christ: Verse 5, "So also Christ
   glorified not himself to be made an high priest." Were it not that very
   priesthood of which he treats that Christ was so called to, it were
   easy so to reply, "True, to a proper priesthood a man must be called,
   but that which is improper and metaphorical only he may assume to
   himself, or obtain it upon a more general account, as all believers
   do;" but this the apostle excludes, by comparing Christ in his
   admission to this office with Aaron, who was properly so.

   (2.) In particular, all the parts of this description have in the
   Scripture a full and complete accommodation unto Jesus Christ, so that
   he must needs be properly a high priest, if this be the description of
   such an one:-- [1.] He was taken from amongst men. That great prophecy
   of him so describes him, Deut. xviii. 18, "I will raise them up a
   prophet from among their brethren." He was taken from among men, or
   raised up from among men, or raised up from among his brethren. And, in
   particular, it is mentioned out of what tribe amongst them he was
   taken: Heb. vii. 13, 14, "For he of whom these things are spoken
   pertaineth to another tribe: for it is evident that our Lord sprang out
   of Juda." And the family he was of in that tribe, namely, that of
   David, is everywhere mentioned: "God raised up the horn of salvation in
   the house of his servant David," Luke i. 69. [2.] He was ordained for
   men, ta pros ton Theon, as to things appointed by God. Kathistatai is,
   "appointed to rule, and preside, and govern, as to the things of God."
   This ordination or appointment is that after mentioned which he had of
   God, his ordination to this office: Heb. v. 5, 6, "So also Christ
   glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto
   him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee," etc. He had his
   ordination from God. He who made him both Lord and Christ made him also
   a high priest. And he was made in a more solemn manner than ever any
   priest was, even by an oath: Chap. vii. 20, 21, "Inasmuch as not
   without an oath," etc. And he was so appointed for men, to preside and
   govern them in things appertaining to God, as it was with the high
   priest of old. The whole charge of the house of God, as to holy things,
   his worship and his service, was committed to him. So is it with Jesus
   Christ: Chap. iii. 6, "Christ is a Son over his own house; whose house
   are we." He is for us and over us in the things of the worship and
   house of God. And that he was ordained for men the Holy Ghost assures
   us farther, chap. vii. 26, "Such an high priest became us;" he was so
   for us. Which is the first part of the description of a high priest,
   properly so called. [3.] The prime and peculiar end of this office is
   to offer gifts and sacrifices for sin. And as we shall abundantly
   manifest afterward that Christ did thus offer gifts and sacrifices for
   sin, so the apostle professedly affirms that it was necessary he should
   do so, because he was a high priest: Chap. viii. 3, "For every high
   priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of
   necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer." The force of the
   apostle's argument concerning the necessity of the offering of Christ
   lies thus: Every high priest is to offer gifts and sacrifices; but
   Christ is a high priest: therefore he must have somewhat to offer. Now,
   if Christ was not a high priest properly so called, it is evident his
   argument would be inconclusive; for from that which is properly so to
   that which is only so metaphorically and as to some likeness and
   proportion, no argument will lie. For instance, every true man is a
   rational creature; but he that shall thence conclude that a painted man
   is so will find his conclusion very feeble. What it is that Christ had
   to offer, and what sacrifice he offered, shall afterward be declared.
   The definition, then, of a high priest, properly so called, in all the
   parts of it, belonging unto Christ, it is necessary that the thing
   defined belong also unto him.

   2. He who is a priest according to the order of a true and real
   priesthood, he is a true and real priest. Believers are called priests,
   Rev. i. 6, and are said to offer up sacrifices to God, spiritual
   sacrifices, such as God is pleased with, Heb. xiii. 16. Whence is it
   that they are not real and proper priests? Because they are not priests
   of any real order of priesthood, but are so called because of some
   allusion to and resemblance of the priests of old in their access unto
   God, 1 Pet. ii. 9; Eph. ii. 18; Heb. x. 22. This will also, by the way,
   discover the vanity of them among us who would have the ministers of
   the gospel, in contradistinction to other believers, be called priests.
   Of what order were they who did appropriate that appellation? The
   absurdity of this figment the learned Hooker could no otherwise defend
   than by affirming that priest was an abbreviation of presbyter, when
   both in truth and in the intendment of them that used that term, its
   sense was otherwise. But to return. The sons of Aaron were properly
   priests. Why so? Because they were so appointed in the line of the
   priesthood of Levi, according to the order of Aaron. Hence I assume,
   Christ being called a priest according to the order of a true and
   proper priesthood, was truly and properly so. He was "a priest after
   the order of Melchizedek," Ps. cx. 4; which the apostle often insists
   on in the Epistle to the Hebrews. If you say that Christ is called "a
   priest after the order of Melchizedek," not properly, but by reason of
   some proportion and analogy, or by way of allusion to him, you may as
   well say that he was a priest according to the order of Aaron, there
   being a great similitude between them; against which the apostle
   expressly disputes in the whole of the 7th chapter to the Hebrews. He
   therefore was a real priest, according to a real and proper order.

   3. Again; he that was appointed of God to offer sacrifices for the sins
   of men was a priest properly so called; but that Christ did so and was
   so appointed will appear in our farther consideration of the time when
   he was a priest, as also in that following, of the sacrifice he
   offered, so that at present I shall not need to insist upon it.

   4. Let it be considered that the great medium of the apostolical
   persuasion against apostasy in that Epistle to the Hebrews consists in
   the exalting of the priesthood of Christ above that of Aaron. Now, that
   which is only metaphorically so in any kind is clearly and evidently
   less so than that which is properly and directly so. If Christ be only
   metaphorically a priest, he is less than Aaron on that consideration.
   He may be far more excellent than Aaron in other respects, yet in
   respect of the priesthood he is less excellent; which is so directly
   opposite to the design of the apostle in that epistle as nothing can be
   more.

   It is, then, evident on all these considerations, and might be made
   farther conspicuous by such as are in readiness to be added, that
   Christ was and is truly and properly a high priest; which was the first
   thing designed for confirmation.

   The Racovian Catechism doth not directly ask or answer this question,
   Whether Christ be a high priest properly so called? but yet insinuates
   its author's judgment expressly to the contrary:--

   The sacerdotal office of Christ is placed herein, that as by his kingly
   office he can help and relieve our necessities, so by his sacerdotal
   office he will help, and actually doth so; and this way of his helping
   or relieving us is called his sacrifice. [445]

   Thus they begin. But, -- 1. That any office of Christ should bespeak
   power to relieve us without a will, as is here affirmed of his kingly,
   is a proud, foolish, and ignorant fancy. Is this enough for a king
   among men, that he is able to relieve his subjects, though he be not
   willing? or is not this a proper description of a wicked tyrant? Christ
   as a king is willing as well as able to save, Isa. xxxii. 1, 2. 2.
   Christ as a high priest is no less able than willing also, and as a
   king he is no less willing than able, Heb. vii. 25. That is, as a king
   he is both able and willing to save us, as to the application of
   salvation and the means thereof; as a priest he is both willing and
   able to save us, as to the procuring of salvation and all the means
   thereof. 3. It is a senseless folly, to imagine that the sacrifice of
   Christ consists in the manner of affording us that help and relief
   which as a king he is able to give us. Such weak engines do these men
   apply for the subversion of the cross of Christ! But of this more
   afterward.

   But they proceed to give us their whole sense in the next question and
   answer, which are as follow:--

   Q. Why is this way of his affording help called a sacrifice?

   A. It is called so by a figurative manner of speaking; for as in the
   old covenant the high priest entering into the holiest of holies did do
   those things which pertained to the expiation of the sins of the
   people, so Christ hath now entered the heavens, that there he might
   appear before God for us, and perform all things that belong to the
   expiation of our sins. [446]

   The sum of what is here insinuated is, -- 1. That the sacrifice of
   Christ is but a figurative sacrifice, and so, consequently, that he
   himself is a figurative priest: for as the priest is, such is his
   sacrifice, -- proper, if proper; metaphorical, if metaphorical. What
   say our catechists for the proof hereof? They have said it; not one
   word of reason or any one testimony of Scripture is produced to give
   countenance to this figment. 2. That the high priest made atonement and
   expiation of sins only by his entering into the most holy place and by
   what he did there; which is notoriously false, and contrary to very
   many express testimonies of Scripture, Lev. iv. 3, 18, 22, 27, v. 17,
   vi. 2-7, xvi. 1-6, etc. 3. That Christ was not a high priest until he
   entered the holy place; of which afterward. 4. That he made not
   expiation of our sins until he entered heaven and appeared in the
   presence of God; of the truth whereof let the reader consult Heb. i. 3.
   If Christ be a figurative priest, I see no reason why he is not a
   figurative king also; and such, indeed, those men seem to make him.

   The second thing proposed is, that Christ was a high priest whilst he
   was on the earth, and offered a sacrifice to God. I shall here first
   answer what was objected by Mr B. to the contrary, and then confirm the
   truth itself.

   I say then, first, that Christ was a priest while he was on earth; and
   he continueth to be so for ever, -- that.is, until the whole work of
   mediation be accomplished.

   Socinus first published his opinion in this business in his book, "De
   Jesu Christo Servatore," against Covet. For some time the venom of that
   error was not taken notice of. Six years after, as himself telleth us
   (Ep. ad Niemojev. 1 [447] ), he wrote his answer to Volanus, wherein he
   confirmed it again at large; whereupon Niemojevius, a man of his own
   antitrinitarian infidelity, writes to him, and asks him sharply (in
   substance) if he was not mad, to affirm a thing so contrary to express
   texts of Scripture. [448] (Ep. Joh. Niemojev. ad Faust. Socin.) Before
   him, that atheistical monk Ochinus had dropped some few things in his
   dialogues hereabout. Before him, also, Abelardus had made an entrance
   into the same abomination; of whom says Bernard, Ep. 190, "Habemus in
   Francia novum de veteri magistro theologum, qui ab ineunte ætate sua in
   arte dialectica lusit; et nunc in Scripturis sanctis insanit."

   How the whole nation of the Socinians have since consented into this
   notion of their master, I need not manifest. It is grown one of the
   articles of their creed, as this man here lays it down among the
   substantial grounds of Christian religion. Confessedly on their part,
   the whole doctrine of the satisfaction of Christ and justification
   turns on this hinge: for though we have other innumerable
   demonstrations of the truth we assert, yet as to them, if this be
   proved, no more is needful; for if Christ was a priest, and offered
   himself a sacrifice, it cannot but be a sacrifice of atonement, seeing
   it was by blood and death. Crellius tells us that Christ died for us on
   a double account; partly as the mediator and surety of the new
   covenant, partly as a priest that was to offer himself to God. [449] A
   man might think he granted Christ to have been a priest on the earth,
   and as such to have offered himself a sacrifice. So also doth Volkelius
   allow the killing of the sacrifice to represent the death of Christ.
   [450] Now, the killing of the sacrifice was the sacrificing of it. So
   Stuckius proves from that of the poet, [451] "Et nigram mactabis ovem,
   lucumque revises." But Crellius afterward expounds himself, and tells
   us that this twofold office of Christ (than which nothing can be spoken
   more ridiculously) of a mediator and a priest did as it were meet in
   the death of Christ, the one ending (that is, his being a mediator),
   and the other beginning; [452] and Volkelius doth the like, with a
   sufficient contradiction to his assertion, calling the death of Christ
   the beginning and entrance of his priesthood. [453] As for his
   mediatorship, Crellius telleth us that it is most evident that Christ
   therein was "subordinate to God" (so he phrases it); that is, he was a
   mediator with us for God, and not at all with God for us. [454] And
   this he proves, because he put not himself into this office, nor was
   put into it by us, so as to confirm the covenant between God and us,
   but was a minister and messenger of God, who sent him for this purpose.
   [455] But the folly of this shall be afterward manifested. Christ was
   given of God, by his own consent, to be a mediator for us, and to lay
   down his life a ransom for us, 1 Tim. ii. 3-6; which certainly he did
   to God for us, and not for God to us, as shall afterward be evinced.
   But coming to speak of his priesthood he is at a loss. "When," saith
   he, "he is considered as a priest" (for that he was properly a priest
   he denies, calling it "Sacerdotii, et oblationis metaphora,") "although
   he seemeth to be like one who doth something with God in the name of
   men, if we consider diligently, we shall find that he is such a priest
   as performs something with us in the name of God." [456]

   This proof is para ten sunthesin kai diairesin. But this is no new
   thing with these men: "Because Christ, as a high priest, doth something
   with us for God, therefore he did nothing with God for us;" as though,
   because the high priest of old was over the house of God and ruled
   therein, therefore he did not offer sacrifices to God for the sins of
   the people. All that Crellius in his ensuing discourse hath to prove
   this by, is because, as he saith, "Christ offered not his sacrifice
   until he came to heaven;" which because he proves not, nor endeavours
   to do it, we may see what are the texts of Scripture urged for the
   confirmation of that conceit by Mr B. and others.

   Seeing all the proofs collected for this purpose are out of the Epistle
   to the Hebrews, I shall consider them in order as they lie in the
   epistle, and not as transposed by his questions with whom I have to do.

   The first is in his 11th question, thus insinuated: "Why would God have
   Christ come to his priestly office by suffering?" According to the
   tenor of the doctrine before delivered, the inference is, that until
   after his sufferings he obtained not his priestly office, for by them
   he entered upon it. The answer is, "Heb. ii. 10, 17, 18."

   Ans. The apostle doth not say absolutely that it became Christ to be
   made like us that he might be a high priest, but that he might be a
   merciful high priest; that is, his sufferings and death were not
   required antecedently that he might be a priest, but they were required
   to the execution of that end of his priesthood which consists in
   sympathy and sufferance together with them in whose stead he was a
   priest. He sustained all his afflictions, and death itself, not that he
   might be a priest, but that being merciful, and having experience, he
   might on that account be ready to "succour them that are tempted;" and
   this the words of the last verse do evidently evince to be the meaning
   of the Holy Ghost, "In that he himself hath suffered being tempted,"
   etc. His sufferings were to this end of his priesthood, that he should
   be "merciful, able to succour them that are tempted." Besides, it is
   plainly said that he was a high priest, eis to hilaskesthai tas
   hamartias tou laou or hilaskesthai ton Theon peri ton hamartion, -- "to
   make reconciliation for the sins of the people." Now, that
   reconciliation was made by his blood and death the Scripture informs
   us: Rom. v. 10, "When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
   death of his Son;" Dan. ix. 24. So that even from this place of
   Scripture, produced to the contrary, it is evident that Christ "was a
   high priest on earth," because he was so when he made reconciliation,
   which he did in his death on the cross.

   But yet Mr B.'s candid procedure in this business may be remarked, with
   his huckstering the word of God. He reads the words in this order: "It
   became him to make the captain of their salvation perfect through
   sufferings, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest." Who
   would not conclude that this is the series and tenor of the apostle's
   discourse, and that Christ is said to be made perfect through
   sufferings, that he might be a merciful high priest? These words, of
   "making perfect through sufferings," are part of the 10th verse; "that
   he might be a merciful high priest," part of the 17th; between which
   two there intercedes a discourse of a business quite of another nature,
   -- namely, his being "made like his brethren" in taking on him "the
   seed of Abraham," whereof these words, "that he might be a merciful and
   faithful high priest," are the immediate issue; that is, he had a body
   prepared him that he might be a priest and have a sacrifice. "Our high
   priest was exercised with sufferings and temptations," says the
   apostle: "Jesus was exercised with sufferings and temptations that he
   might be our high priest," says Mr B.!

   Heb. viii. 1, 2, is insisted on to the same purpose in his third
   question, which is, --

   Q. What manner of high priest is Christ?

   A. Heb. viii. 1, 2, "We have such a high priest, who is set on the
   right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of
   the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle," etc.

   I name this in the next place, because it is coincident with that of
   chap. iv. 14, insisted on by Socinus, though omitted by our author.

   Hence it is inferred that Christ entered the heavens before he was a
   high priest, and is a high priest only when he is "set down on the
   right hand of the Majesty on high."

   Ans. That Christ is a high priest there also we grant; that he is so
   there only, there is not one word in the place cited to prove. Heb. iv.
   14 saith, indeed, that "our high priest is passed into the heavens,"
   but it says not that he was not our high priest before he did so, as
   the high priest of the Jews entered into the holy place, but yet he was
   a high priest before, or he could not have entered into it. He is "such
   an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of Majesty;"
   that is, not like the typical high priest, who died and was no more,
   but he abides in his office of priesthood; not to offer sacrifice, for
   that he did once for all, but to intercede for us for ever.

   Heb. viii. 4 is nextly produced, in answer to this question, --

   Q. Was not Christ a priest whilst he was upon earth, namely, when he
   died on the cross?

   A. Heb. viii. 4, vii. 15, 16.

   The same question and answer are given by the Racovian Catechism, and
   this is the main place insisted on by all the Socinians: "For if he
   were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests
   that offer gifts according to the law."

   Ans. 1. Epi ges may be interpreted of the state and condition of him
   spoken of, and not of the place wherein he was. If he were epi ges, of
   a mere earthly condition, as the high priest of the Jews, he should not
   be a priest: so is the expression used elsewhere. Col. iii. 2, we are
   commanded "not to mind ta epi tes ges," -- that is, "terrene things,
   earthly things" And verse 5, "Mortify your members ta epi tes ges," --
   that is, "your earthly members."

   2. If the words signify the place, and not the condition of the things
   whereof they are [expressive], they may be referred to the tabernacle,
   of which he speaks, and not to the high priest. Verse 2, the apostle
   tells us that he is the minister or priest of the true tabernacle,
   which the Lord pitched, and not man; and then, verse 3, that in the
   other tabernacle there were priests that offered daily sacrifices: so
   that, saith he, if this tabernacle en epi ges, he should not be a
   priest of it; for in the earthly tabernacle there were other
   administrators. But to pass these interpretations, --

   3. The apostle does not say that he that is upon the earth can be no
   priest, which must be our adversaries' argument, if any, from this
   place, and thus formed: He that is upon the earth is no priest; Christ
   before his ascension was upon the earth: therefore he was no priest.
   This is not the intendment of the apostle, for in the same verse he
   affirms that there were priests on the earth. This, then, is the utmost
   of his intendment, that if Christ had been only to continue on the
   earth, and to have done what priests did or were to do upon the earth,
   there was neither need of him nor room for him; but now he is a priest,
   seeing he was not to take upon him their work, but had an eternal
   priesthood of his own to administer. There is no more in this place
   than there is in chap. vii. 19, 23, 24; which is a clear assertion that
   Christ had a priesthood of his own, which was to perfect and complete
   all things, being not to share with the priests, that had all their
   work to do upon the earth; and in verses 13-15 of chap. vii. you have a
   full exposition of the whole matter. The sum is, Christ was none of the
   priests of the old testament, no priest of the law; all their earthly
   things vanished when he undertook the administration of the heavenly.
   So that neither doth this at all evince that Christ was not a priest of
   the order of Melchizedek even before his ascension.

   To this Heb. vii. 15, 16 is urged, and these words, "After the power of
   an endless life," are insisted on; as though Christ was not a priest
   until after he had ended his life and risen again.

   But is this the intendment of the apostle? doth he aim at any such
   thing? The apostle is insisting on one of his arguments, to prove from
   the institution of the priesthood of Melchizedek, or rather a
   priesthood after his order, the excellency of the priesthood of Christ
   above that of Aaron. From the manner of the institution of the one and
   of the other this argument lien Says he, "The priests of the Jews were
   made kata nomon entoles sarkikes, according to the law of a carnal
   commandment," -- that is, by carnal rites and ceremonies, by carnal oil
   and ordinances; "but this man is made a priest after the order of
   Melchisedec, kata dunamin zoes akatalutou, by virtue of an endless
   life, -- by the appointment of God, having such a life as should never
   by death interrupt him in the administration of his office:" for though
   the life of Christ was intercepted three days, yet his person was never
   dissolved as to the administration of his office of priesthood, which
   is the thing spoken of, and in respect of that he had an "endless
   life."

   Question 9 is to the same purpose:--

   Q. How did Christ enter into the holy place to offer himself?

   A. Heb. ix. 12, "By his own blood."

   Ans. Would not any one imagine, [from this question,] that it was said
   in the Scripture that Christ entered into the holy place to offer
   himself? that that is taken for granted, and the modus or manner how he
   did it is alone inquired after? This is but one part of the sophistry
   Mr B. makes use of in this Scripture Catechism; but it is so far from
   being a true report of the testimony of the Scripture, that the plain
   contrary is asserted, -- namely, that Christ offered himself before his
   entrance into the holy place not made with hands, and then entered
   thereinto, to appear in the presence of God for us. Christ entered by
   his own blood into the holy place, inasmuch as, having shed and offered
   his blood a sacrifice to God, with the efficacy of it, he entered into
   his presence to carry on the work of his priesthood in his intercession
   for us; as the high priest, having offered without a sacrifice to God,
   entered with the blood of it into the most holy place, there to perfect
   and complete the duties of his office in offering and interceding for
   the people.

   The remaining questions of this chapter may be speedily despatched. His
   sixth is:--

   Q. What benefit happeneth by Christ's priesthood?

   A. Heb. v. 9, 10.

   Though the place be very improperly urged as to an answer to the
   question proposed, there being very many more testimonies clearly and
   distinctly expressing the immediate fruits and benefits of the priestly
   office of Christ, yet because we grant that by his priesthood,
   principally and eminently, Christ is become the author of salvation, we
   shall not dissent as to this question and answer. Only, we add as to
   the manner, that the way whereby Christ by his priesthood became the
   author of salvation consists principally in the offering up of himself
   to death in and by the shedding of his blood, whereby he obtained for
   us eternal redemption, Heb. ix. 14, 26.

   But this Mr B. makes inquiry after:--

   Q. How can Christ save them by his priesthood?

   A. Heb. vii. 25, ix. 28.

   Ans. We acknowledge the use of the intercession of Christ for the
   carrying on and the completing of the work of our salvation, as also
   that it is the apostle's design there to manifest his ability to save
   beyond what the Aaronical priests could pretend unto, which is
   mentioned chap. vii. 25; but that "he saves us thereby," exclusively to
   the oblation he made of himself at his death, or any otherwise but as
   carrying on that work whose foundation was laid therein (redemption
   being meritoriously procured thereby), I suppose Mr B. doth not think
   that this place is any way useful to prove. And that place which he
   subjoins is not added at all to the advantage of his intendment; for it
   is most evident that it is of the offering of Christ by death and the
   shedding of his blood, or the sacrifice of himself, as verse 26, that
   the apostle there speaks.

   There is not any thing else that is needful for me to insist upon in
   this chapter; for though the Scripture instructs us in many other uses
   that we are to make of the doctrine of the priesthood of Christ than
   what he expresses in his last question, yet that being one eminent one
   amongst them (especially the foundation of coming with boldness to the
   throne of grace, being rightly understood), I shall not need to insist
   farther on it.

   Not to put myself or reader to any needless trouble, Mr B.
   acknowledging that Christ is a high priest, and having opposed only his
   investiture with the office whilst he was upon the earth, and that to
   destroy the atonement made by the sacrifice of himself, having proved
   that he was a priest properly so called, I shall now prove that he was
   a high priest whilst he was upon earth, and show afterward what he had
   to offer, with the efficacy of his sacrifice, and the intent thereof:--

   1. The Scripture will speedily determine the difference: Eph. v. 2,
   "Christ hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a
   sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour." He that offereth
   sacrifices and offerings unto God is a priest; so the apostle defines a
   priest, Heb. v. 1. He is one "taken from amongst men," and "ordained to
   offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins," Now, thus did Christ do in
   his giving himself for us. Paredoken, "he delivered himself for us."
   "To deliver himself," or "to be delivered for us," notes his death,
   always in contradistinction to any other act of his: so Eph. v. 25,
   Gal. ii. 20, Rom. viii. 32, iv. 25, Hos paredothe dia ta paraptomata
   hemon kai egerthe dia ten dikaiosin hemon. In that delivery of himself
   he sacrificed, therefore he was then a priest.

   To this Socinus invented an answer, in his book "De Servatore," which
   he insists on again, Ep. 2 ad Niemojev., and whereunto his followers
   have added nothing, it being fixed on by them all, in particular by
   Smalcius in Cat. Rac.; and yet it is in itself ludicrous, and almost
   jocular. The words, they tell us, are thus to be read: Paredoken
   heauton huper hemon, and there they place a point in the verse,
   prosphoran kai thusian to Theo, without any dependence upon the former
   words; making this to be the sense of the whole: "Christ gave himself
   to death for us; and O what an offering was that to God! and O what a
   sacrifice!" that is, in a metaphorical sense; not that Christ offered
   himself to God for us, but that Paul called his giving himself to die
   "an offering," or a thing grateful to God, as good works are called "an
   offering," Phil. iv. 18; -- that is, the dying of Christ was "præclarum
   facinus," as Volkelius speaks. [457] But, --

   (1.) It is easy to answer or avoid any thing by such ways as this.
   Divide, cut off sentences in the dependence of the words, and you may
   make what sense of them you please, or none at all.

   (2.) These words, prosphoran kai thusian, have no other word to be
   regulated by but paredoken, and therefore must relate thereunto; and
   Christ is affirmed in them to have given himself "an offering and a
   sacrifice."

   (3.) These words, "An offering and a sacrifice," are not a commendation
   of Christ's giving himself, but an illustration and a description of
   what he gave, -- that is, himself, a sacrifice of sweet savour to God.
   So that notwithstanding this exception (becoming only them that make
   it), it is evident from hence that Christ offered himself a sacrifice
   in his death, and was therefore then a priest fitted for that work.

   2. Heb. v. 6, 7, "As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest
   for ever after the order of Melchisedec. Who in the days of his flesh,
   when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and
   tears unto him that was able to save him from death,"' etc. Verse 6,
   the apostle tells us that he was a priest; and, verse 7, what he did by
   virtue of that priesthood, -- prosenenke deeseis kai hiketerias. It is
   a temple expression of the office of a priest that is used. So verse 1,
   a high priest is appointed hina prosphere, "that he may offer." Now,
   when did Christ do this? It was "in the days of his flesh, with strong
   crying and tears;" both which evidence this his offering to have been
   before his death and at his death. And his mentioning of prayers and
   tears is not so much to show the matter of his offering, which was
   himself, as the manner, or at least the concomitants of the sacrifice
   of himself, -- prayers and tears. And these were not for himself, but
   for his church, and the business that for their sakes he had
   undertaken.

   3. Heb. i. 3, "When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the
   right hand of the Majesty on high." The purging of our sins was by
   sacrifice; there was never any other way katharismou. But now Christ
   did this before his ascension: Katharismon poiesamenos, -- "When he had
   by himself," or after he had, "purged our sins;" and that di heautou,
   "by himself," or the sacrifice of himself. That our sins are purged by
   the oblation of Christ the Scripture is clear; hence his blood is said
   to "cleanse us from all sin," 1 John i. 7. And, Heb. x. 10,
   "sanctified" is the same with "purged," and this "through the offering
   of the body of Christ ephapax." Christ, then, offering this sacrifice
   whilst he was on the earth, was a priest in so doing.

   Unto this may be added sundry others of the same import: Chap. vii. 27,
   "Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice,
   first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did
   once, when he offered up himself." The one sacrifice of Christ is here
   compared to the daily sacrifices of the priests. Now, those daily
   sacrifices were not performed in the most holy place, whither the high
   priest entered but once in a year; which alone was a representation of
   heaven: so that what Christ did in heaven cannot answer to them, but
   what he did on earth, before he entered the holy place not made with
   hands.

   And chap. ix. 12, "He entered by his own blood into the holy place,
   aionian lutrosin heuramenos," -- "after he had obtained eternal
   redemption." Redemption is everywhere in the Scripture ascribed to the
   blood of Christ; and himself abundantly manifesteth in what account it
   is to be had, when he says that "he gave his life a ransom," or "a
   price of redemption." Where and when Christ laid down his life we know;
   and yet that our redemption or freedom is by the offering of Christ for
   us is as evident: Chap. ix. 26, "He put away sin" (which is our
   redemption) "by the sacrifice of himself;" so that this sacrifice of
   himself was before he entered the holy place; and consequently he was a
   priest before his entrance into heaven. It is, I say, apparent from
   these places that Christ offered himself before he went into the holy
   place, or sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high; which was
   to be proved from them.

   4. Christ is often said to "offer himself once for all;" designing by
   that expression some individual action of Christ, and not such a
   continued course of procedure as is his presentation of himself in
   heaven, or the continuation of his oblation, as to its efficacy, by his
   intercession. So Heb. vii. 27, Touto epoiesen ephapax ix. 28, Hapax
   prosenechtheis, etc.; x. 10, 12, 14. In all these places the offering
   of Christ is not only said to be one, but to be once offered. Now, no
   offering of Christ besides that which he offered on the earth can be
   said to be once offered; for that which is done in heaven is done
   always and for ever, but that which is done always cannot be said to be
   done once for all. To be always done or in doing, as is Christ's
   offering himself in heaven, and to be done once for all, as was the
   oblation spoken of in those places, whereby our sins are done away, are
   plainly contradictory. It is said to be so offered hapax as to be
   opposed unto pollakis, whereby the apostle expresses that of the
   Aaronical sacrifice, which in two other words he had before delivered.
   They were offered eis to dienekes and kath hemeran, that is, pollakis:
   in which sense his offering himself in heaven cannot be said to be done
   hapax but only that on the cross. Besides, he was hapax prosenechtheis
   eis to pollon anenenkein hamartias, chap. ix. 28, and how he did that
   we are informed, 1 Pet. ii. 24, Hos tas hamartias hemon autos aneenken
   en to somati autou epi to xulon, -- he did it in his own body on the
   tree.

   Besides, the apostle, Heb. ix. 26, tells us that he speaks of such an
   offering as was accompanied with suffering: "He must often have
   suffered since the foundation of the world." It was such an offering as
   could neither be repeated nor continued without suffering that he
   treats of. We do not deny that Christ offers himself in heaven, -- that
   is, that he presents himself as one that was so offered to his Father;
   but the offering of himself, that was on earth: and therefore there was
   he a priest.

   5. Once more; that sacrifice which answered those sacrifices whose
   blood was never carried into the holy place, that must be performed on
   earth, and not in heaven. That many proper sacrifices were offered as
   types of Christ, whose blood was not carried into the holy place, the
   apostle assures us, Heb. x. 11. The daily sacrifices had none of their
   blood carried into the holy place, for the high priest went in thither
   only once in the year; but now these were all true sacrifices and types
   of the sacrifice of Christ, and therefore the sacrifice of Christ also,
   to answer the types, must be offered before his entrance into heaven,
   as was in part declared before: yea, there was no other sacrifice of
   these but what was performed in their killing and slaying; and
   therefore there must be a sacrifice, prefigured by them, consisting in
   killing and shedding of blood. All this is asserted by the apostle,
   Heb. vii. 27, "Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer
   up sacrifice, first for his own sins and then for the people's: for
   this he did once, when he offered up himself." Those sacrifices which
   were offered kath hemeran, "daily," were types of the sacrifice of
   Christ, and that of his which was offered ephapax did answer thereunto,
   -- which was his death, and nothing else.

Chapter XXI.

   Of the death of Christ, the causes, ends, and fruits thereof, with an
   entrance into the doctrine of his satisfaction thereby.

   Mr Biddle's twelfth chapter is concerning the death of Christ, the
   causes, and fruits, and ends thereof; the error and mistake whereabout
   is the second great head of the Socinian religion. Next to his person,
   there is not any thing they set themselves so industriously to oppose
   as his death, in the sense wherein it hath constantly hitherto been
   embraced by all Christians, -- as the great foundation of their faith
   and confidence.

   That the Lord Jesus, our mediator, did not, by his death and
   sufferings, undergo the penalty of the law as the punishment due to our
   sins; that he did not make satisfaction to God, or make reconciliation
   for transgressors; that he did not thereby properly redeem us by the
   payment of a ransom, nor so suffer for us as that our sins should, in
   the justice of God, be a meritorious cause of his suffering, -- is the
   second great article of the creed which they labour to assert and
   maintain. [458]

   There is not any thing about which they have laid out so much of their
   strength as about this, namely, that Jesus Christ is called our Saviour
   in respect of the way of salvation which he hath revealed to us, and
   the power committed to him to deliver us and save us, in and by
   obedience required at our hands, not on the account of any satisfaction
   he hath made for us, or atonement by the sacrifice of himself.

   How Faustus Socinus first broached this opinion, with what difficulty
   he got it to be entertained with the men of his own profession as to
   the doctrine of the Trinity, has been before declared. What weight he
   laid upon this opinion about the death of Christ, and the opposition he
   had engaged in against his satisfaction, with the diligence he used and
   the pains he took about the one and the other, is evident from his
   writings to this purpose which are yet extant. His book, "De Jesu
   Christo Servatore," is wholly taken up with this argument; so is the
   greatest part of his "Prelections;" his "Lectiones Sacræ" are some of
   them on the same subject; and his "Parænesis" against Volanus, many of
   his epistles, especially those to Smalcius, and Volkelius, and
   Niemojevius, as also his treatises about justification, have the same
   design. Smalcius is no less industrious in the same cause, both in his
   Racovian Catechism and in his answers and replies with Franzius and
   Smiglecius. It is the main design of Schlichtingius' comment on the
   Hebrews, Crellius, "De Causis Mortis Christi," and in his defence of
   Socinus against Grotius, dwells on this doctrine. Volkelius hath his
   share in the same work, etc.

   What those at large contend for, Mr B. endeavours slily to insinuate
   into his catechumens in this chapter. Having, therefore, briefly spoken
   of salvation by Christ, and of his mediation in general, in
   consideration of his sixth and seventh chapters, I shall now, God
   assisting, take up the whole matter, and, after a brief discovery of
   his intendment in his queries concerning the death of Christ, give an
   account of our whole doctrine of his satisfaction, confirming it from
   the Scriptures, and vindicating it from the exceptions of his masters.

   For the order of procedure, I shall first consider Mr B.'s questions;
   then state the point in difference by expressing what is the judgment
   of our adversaries concerning the death of Christ, and what we ascribe
   thereto; and then demonstrate from the Scripture the truth contended
   for.

   Mr B.'s first question is, --

   Q. Was it the will and purpose of God that Christ should suffer the
   death of the cross? What saith the apostle Peter to the Jews concerning
   this?

   A. Acts ii. 22, 23.

   To which he subjoins, --

   Q. What say the disciples in general concerning the same?

   A. Acts iv. 24-28.

   It is not unknown what difference we have both with the Socinians and
   Arminians about the purposes and efficacious decrees, and the
   infallibility of the prescience of God. Something already hath been
   spoken to this purpose, in our discourse concerning the prescience of
   God, as formerly in that of perseverance. How unable Mr B.'s companions
   are to disentangle themselves from the evidence of that testimony which
   is given to the truth we contend for by these texts which here he with
   so much confidence recites, hath been abundantly by others
   demonstrated. I shall not here enter into the merits of that cause, nor
   shall I impose on Mr B. the opinion of any other man which he doth not
   expressly own; only I shall desire him to reconcile what he here speaks
   in his query with what he before delivered concerning "God's not
   foreseeing our free actions that are for to come." What God purposes
   shall be and come to pass, he certainly foresees that that will come to
   pass. That Christ should die the death of the cross was to be brought
   about by the free actions of men, if any thing in the world was ever
   so, and accomplished in the same manner; yet that this should be done,
   yea, so done, God purposed: and therefore, without doubt, he foresaw
   that it should be accomplished, and so foresaw all the free actions
   whereby it was accomplished. And if he foresaw any one free action, why
   not all, there being the same reason of one and all? But at the present
   let this pass. His second question is, --

   Q. Did Christ die to reconcile and bring God to us, or, on the
   contrary, to bring us to God?

   A. Rom. v. 10; Eph. ii. 14, 16; 2 Cor. v. 19; 1 Pet. iii. 18.

   That I may by the way speak a little to this question, reserving the
   full discussion of the matter intended to the ensuing discourse, the
   terms of it are first to be explained:--

   1. By "reconciling God," we intend the making of such an atonement as
   whereby his wrath or anger, in all the effects of it, is turned away.
   Though we use not the expression of "reconciling God to us," but of
   "reconciling us to God," by the taking away or removal of his wrath and
   anger, or the making reconciliation with God for sin, yet, as to
   reconcile God intends the appeasing of the justice and anger of God, so
   that whereas before we were obnoxious to his displeasure, enmity,
   hatred, and wrath, thereby and on that account, we come to be accepted
   with him, we say Christ died to reconcile God to us; which in the
   progress of this discourse, with plentiful demonstrations from the
   Scripture, shall be evinced.

   2. Of "bringing God to us" we speak not; unless by "bringing God to us"
   he intends the procurement of the grace and favour of God toward us,
   and his loving presence to be with us, and then we say in that sense
   Christ by his death brought God to us.

   3. "Our reconciliation to God," or the reconciliation as it stands on
   our part, is our conversion unto God, our deliverance from all that
   enmity and opposition unto God which are in us by nature; and this also
   we say is the effect and fruit of the death of Christ.

   4. "Our bringing unto God," mentioned 1 Pet. iii. 18, is of a larger
   and more comprehensive signification than that of our reconciliation,
   containing the whole effect of the death of Christ, in the removal of
   every hinderance and the collation of every thing necessarily required
   to the perfect and complete accomplishment of the work of our
   salvation; and so contains no less the reconciliation of God to us than
   ours to him, and is not proper to make up one member of the division
   there instituted, being a general expression of them both.

   Now, concerning these things Mr B. inquires whether Christ by his death
   reconciled God to us, or, on the contrary, us to God; so insinuating
   that one of these effects of the death of Christ is inconsistent with
   the other. This seems to be the man's aim:--

   1. To intimate that this is the state of the difference between him and
   us, that we say Christ died "to reconcile God to us;" and he, that he
   died "to reconcile us to God."

   2. That these things are contrary, so that they who say the one must
   deny the other; -- that we, who say that Christ died to reconcile God
   to us, must of necessity deny that he died to reconcile us to God; and
   that he also, who saith he died to reconcile us to God, may and must
   deny, on that account, the other effect by us ascribed to his death.
   But this sophistry is so gross that it is not worth the while to insist
   upon its discovery. We say that Christ died to reconcile God to us, in
   the sense before explained, and us unto God; and these things are so
   far from being of any repugnancy one to another, as to the making up of
   one entire end and effect of the death of Christ, that without them
   both the work of reconciliation is by no means complete.

   Not to prevent the full proof and evidence hereof, which is intended,
   it may at present suffice that we evince it by the light of this one
   consideration: If in the Scripture it is expressly and frequently
   affirmed, that, antecedently to the consideration of the death of
   Christ and the effects thereof, there is not only a real enmity on our
   part against God, but also a law enmity on the part of God against us,
   and that both of these are removed by virtue of the death of Christ,
   then the reconciliation of God to us and our reconciliation to God are
   both of them one entire effect of the death of Christ. That there is in
   us by nature a real enmity against God, before it be taken away by
   virtue of the death of Christ, and so we reconciled to him, is not
   denied; and if it were, it might be easily evinced from Rom. viii. 7,
   8, Tit. iii. 3, Eph. ii. 12, and innumerable other places. And
   certainly the evidence on the other side, that there was a law-enmity
   on the part of God against us, antecedent to the consideration of the
   death of Christ, is no less clear. The great sanction of the law, Gen.
   iii., Deut. xxvii. 26, considered in conjunction with the justice of
   God, Rom. i. 32, Hab. i. 13, Ps. v. 4-6, 2 Thess. i. 5, 6, and the
   testimonies given concerning the state and condition of man in
   reference to the law and justice of God, John iii. 36, Rom. v. 18, Eph.
   ii. 3, 12, etc., with the express assignation of the reconciliation
   pleaded for to be made by the death of Christ, Dan. ix. 24, Heb. ii.
   14, do abundantly evince it. There being, then, a mutual enmity between
   God and us, though not of the same kind (it being physical on our part,
   and legal or moral on the part of God), Christ, our mediator, making up
   peace and friendship between us doth not only reconcile us to God by
   his Spirit, but God also to us by his blood. But of this more
   afterward, under the consideration of the death of Christ as it was a
   sacrifice.

   For the texts cited by Mr B. as making to his purpose, the most, if not
   all of them, look another way than he intends to use them; they will in
   the following chapter come under full consideration. Rom. v. 10, "When
   we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son," is
   the first mentioned. That our being reconciled to God in this place
   doth not intend our conversion to him, and our deposition of the real
   enmity that is in us against him, but our acceptance with him upon the
   account of the atonement made in the blood of Christ, whereby he is
   reconciled to us, is evident from sundry circumstances of the place;
   for, --

   1. That which is called being "reconciled by his death," in verse 10,
   is being "justified by his blood," verse 9. The observation of the same
   antithesis in beth verses makes this evident. Now, to be justified by
   the blood of Christ is not to have our enmity with God slain and
   destroyed (which is our sanctification), but our acceptation with God
   upon the account of the shedding of the blood of Christ for us; which
   is his reconciliation to us.

   2. We are thus reconciled when we are enemies, as in the verse insisted
   on, "When we were enemies, we were reconciled." Now, we are not
   reconciled in the sense of deposing our enmity to God (that deposition
   being our sanctification) whilst we are enemies; and therefore it is
   the reconciliation of God to us that is intended.

   3. Verse 11, we are said to "receive" this "reconciliation," or, as the
   word is rendered, the "atonement," katallagen. The word is the same
   with that used verse 10. Now, we cannot be said to receive our own
   conversion; but the reconciliation of God by the blood of Christ, his
   favour upon the atonement made, that by faith we do receive.

   Thus Mr B.'s first witness speaks expressly against him and the design
   for the carrying on whereof he was called forth, as afterward will more
   fully appear.

   His second also, of Eph. ii. 14, 16, speaks the same language, "He is
   our peace, who hath made both one, that he might reconcile both unto
   God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby." Setting
   aside the joint design of the apostle, to manifest the reconciliation
   made of Jews and Gentiles by the cross of Christ, it is evident the
   reconciliation here meant consists in slaying the enmity mentioned, so
   making peace. Now, what is the enmity intended? Not the enmity that is
   in our hearts to God, but the legal enmity that lay against us on the
   part of God, as is evident from verse 15 and the whole design of the
   place, as afterward will appear more fully.

   There is, indeed, 2 Cor. v. 18-20, mention made of reconciliation in
   both the senses insisted on; -- of us to God, verse 20, where the
   apostle saith the end of the ministry is to reconcile us to God, to
   prevail with us to lay down our emnity against him and opposition to
   him; of God to us, verse 19, "God was in Christ reconciling the world
   unto himself:" which to be the import of the words is evinced from the
   exegetical expression immediately following, "Not imputing their
   trespasses unto them." God was so reconciling the world unto himself in
   Christ as that, upon the account of what was done in Christ, he will
   not impute their sins; the legal enmity he had against them, on the
   account whereof alone men's sins are imputed to them, being taken away.
   And this is farther cleared by the sum of his former discourse, which
   the apostle gives us, verse 21, declaring how God was in Christ,
   reconciling the world to himself: "For," saith he, "he hath made him
   sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of
   God in him." Thus he was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, in
   that he made him to be sin, or a sacrifice for sin, so to make an
   atonement for us, that we might be accepted before God as righteous on
   the account of Christ.

   Much less doth that of 1 Pet. iii. 18, in the last place mentioned,
   speak at all to Mr B.'s purpose: "Christ hath once suffered for sins,
   the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God." "Bringing to
   God" is a general expression of the accomplishment of the whole work of
   our salvation, both in the removal of all hinderances and the collation
   of all things necessary to the fulfilling of the work. Of this the
   apostle mentions the great fundamental and procuring cause, which is
   the suffering of Christ in our stead, the just for the unjust. Christ
   in our stead suffered for our sins, that he might bring us to God. Now,
   this suffering of Christ in our stead, for our sins, is most eminently
   the cause of the reconciliation of God to us; and, by the intimation
   thereof, of our reconciliation to God, and so of our manuduction to
   him.

   Thus, though it be most true that Christ died to reconcile us to God by
   our conversion to him, yet all the places cited by Mr B. to prove it
   (so unhappy is he in his quotations) speak to the defence of that truth
   which he doth oppose, and not of that which he would assert; and which
   by asserting in opposition to the truth, with which it hath an eminent
   consistency, he doth corrupt.

   The next question I shall not insist upon; it is concerning the object
   of the death of Christ and the universality thereof. The words of it
   are, "For whom did Christ die?" The answer is from 2 Cor. v. 14, 15; 1
   Tim. ii. 6; Heb. ii. 9; John iii. 16; where mention is made of "all"
   and "the world," in reference to the death of Christ. The question
   concerning the object of the death of Christ, or for whom he died, hath
   of late by very many been fully discussed, and I have myself spoken
   elsewhere somewhat to that purpose. [459] It shall not, then, here be
   insisted on. In a word, we confess that Christ died for "all" and for
   "the world;" but whereas it is very seldom that these words are
   comprehensive of all and every man in the world, but most frequently
   are used for some of all sorts, -- they for whom Christ died being in
   some places expounded to be "the church, believers, the children, those
   given unto him out of the world," and nowhere described by any term
   expressive constantly of an absolute universality, -- we say the words
   insisted on are to be taken in the latter sense, and not the former;
   being ready, God assisting, to put it to the issue and trial with our
   adversaries when we are called thereunto.

   He proceeds:--

   Q. What was the procuring cause of Christ's death?

   A. Rom. iv. 25; Isa. liii. 5; 1 Cor. xv. 3.

   The expressions are, that Christ was "delivered for our offences," that
   Christ was "bruised for our iniquities," and "died for our sins."

   That in these and the like places, that clause, "For our offences,
   iniquities, and sins," is expressive of the procuring cause of the
   death of Christ, Mr B. grants. Sin can be no otherwise the procuring
   cause of the death of Christ but as it is morally meritorious thereof.
   To say, "Our sins were the procuring cause of the death of Christ," is
   to say that our sins merited the death of Christ; and whereas this can
   no otherwise be but as our sins were imputed to him, and he was put to
   death for them, Mr B. hath in this one question granted the whole of
   what in this subject he contends against! If our sins were the
   procuring cause of the death of Christ, then the death of Christ was
   that punishment which was due to them, or in the justice, or according
   to the tenor, of the law of God, was procured by them; and so,
   consequently, he in his death underwent the penalty of our sins,
   suffering in our stead, and making thereby satisfaction for what we had
   done amiss. Mr B.'s masters say generally that the expression of "dying
   for our sins" denotes the final cause of the death of Christ; that is,
   Christ intended by his death to confirm the truth, in obedience
   whereunto we shall receive forgiveness of sin. This grant of Mr B.'s,
   that the procuring cause of the death of Christ is hereby expressed,
   will perhaps appear more prejudicial to his whole cause than he is yet
   aware of, especially being proposed in distinction from the final cause
   or end of the death of Christ, which in the next place he mentions, as
   afterward will more fully appear; although, I confess, he is not alone,
   Crellius making the same concession. [460]

   The last question of this chapter is, "What are the ends of Christ's
   suffering and death intimated by the Scripture?" whereunto, by way of
   answer, sundry texts of Scripture are subjoined, every one of them
   expressing some one end or other, some effect or fruit, something of
   the aim and intendment of Christ in his suffering and death; whereunto
   exceeding many others might be annexed. But this business of the death
   of Christ, its causes, ends, and influence into the work of our
   salvation, -- the manifestation that therein he underwent the
   punishment due to our sins, making atonement and giving satisfaction
   for them, redeeming us properly by the price of his blood, etc., --
   being of so great weight and importance as it is, lying at the very
   bottom and foundation of all our hope and confidence, I shall, leaving
   Mr B., handle the whole matter at large in the ensuing chapters.

   For our more clear and distinct procedure in this important head of the
   religion of Jesus Christ, I shall first lay down the most eminent
   considerations of the death of Christ as proposed in the Scripture, and
   then give an account of the most special effects of it in particular,
   answering to those considerations of it; in all manifesting wherein the
   expiation of our sins by his blood doth consist.

   The principal considerations of the death of Christ are of it, -- I. As
   a price; II. As a sacrifice; III. As a penalty: of which in the order
   wherein they are mentioned.

Chapter XXII.

   The several considerations of the death of Christ as to the expiation
   of our sins thereby, and the satisfaction made therein -- First, Of it
   as a price; secondly, As a sacrifice.

   I. The death of Christ in this business is a price, and that properly
   so called: 1 Cor. vi. 20, Egorasthete times, -- "Ye are bought with a
   price." And if we will know what that price was with which we are
   bought, the Holy Ghost informs us, 1 Pet. i. 18, 19, "Ye were not
   redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the
   precious blood of Christ." It is the blood of Christ which in this
   business hath that use which silver and gold have in the redeeming of
   captives; and paid it is into the hand of him by whose power and
   authority the captive is detained, as shall be proved. And himself
   tells us what kind of a price it is that is so paid; it is lutron,
   Matt. xx. 28, "He came to lay down his life lutron anti pollon;" which,
   for its more evidence and clearness, is called antilutron, 1 Tim. ii.
   6, "a price of redemption" for the delivery of another.

   The first mention of a ransom in the Scripture is in Exod. xxi. 30: "If
   there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom
   of his life whatsoever is laid on him." The word in the original is
   pdyn?; which the LXX. there render lutra Dosei lutra tes psuches autou.
   And it is used again in the same sense, Ps. xlix. 9; and in both places
   intends a valuable price, to be paid for the deliverance of that which,
   upon guilt, became obnoxious to death. It is true, the word is from
   pdh?, "redimere, vindicare, asserere in libertatem," by any ways and
   means, by power, strength, or otherwise; but where-ever it is applied
   to such a kind of redemption as had a price going along with it, the
   LXX. constantly render it by apolutroun and sometimes lutrosasthai,
   otherwise by ruomai, and the like.

   It is, then, confessed that pdh?; in the Old Testament is sometimes
   taken for redemit in a metaphorical sense, not strictly and literally
   by the intervention of a price; but that lutrosasthai, the word whereby
   it is rendered when a price intervened, is ever so taken in the New
   Testament, is denied. Indeed, Moses is called lutrotes, Acts vii. 35,
   in reference to the metaphorical redemption of Israel out of Egypt, --
   a deliverance by power and a strong arm; but shall we say, because that
   word is used improperly in one place, where no price could be paid,
   where God plainly says it was not done by a price but by power,
   therefore it must be so used in those places where there is express
   mention of a price, both the matter of it and its formality as a price,
   and speaketh not a word of doing it any other way but by the payment of
   a price? But of this afterward.

   There is mention of "a ransom" in ten places of the Old Testament; "to
   ransom" and "ransomed" in two or three more. In two of these places,
   Exod. xxi. 30 and Ps. xlix. 9, the word is pdyn?, from pdh?, as before,
   and rendered by the LXX. lutron. In all other places it is in the
   Hebrew kphr?, which properly signifies a propitiation, as Ps. xlix. 9;
   which the LXX. have variously rendered. Twice it is mentioned in Job,
   chap. xxxiii. 24 and xxxvi. 18. In the first place they have left it
   quite out, and in the latter so corrupted the sense that they have
   rendered it altogether unintelligible. Prov. vi. 35 and xiii. 8, they
   have properly rendered it lutron, or a price of redemption, it being in
   both places used in such business as a ransom useth to be accepted in.
   Chap. xxi. 18, they have properly rendered it to the subject-matter,
   perikatharma. Perikatharmata are things publicly devoted to
   destruction, as it were to turn away anger from others, coming upon
   them for their sakes.

   So is katharma, "homo piacularis pro lustratione et expiatione patriæ
   devotus;" whence the word is often used, as scelus in Latin, for a
   wicked man, a man fit to be destroyed and taken away. Gruzein de kai
   tolmaton o katharmate, says he in the poet. [461] Katharmos is used in
   the same sense by Herodotus: [462] Katharmon tes chores poieumenon
   Achaion, Athamanta ton Aiolou, -- "Athamas was made a piaculum, or a
   propitiation for the country." Whence Budæus renders that of the
   apostle, Hos perikatharmata tou kosmou egenethemen, "Nos tanquam
   piacula mundi facti sumus, et succedaneæ pro populo victimæ," -- "We
   are as the accursed things of the world, and sacrifices for the
   people," 1 Cor. iv. 13; reading the words, hosper katharmata, not hos
   perikatharmata: the Greek scholiast, who reads it as we commonly do,
   rendering it by aposaromata, as the Vulgar Latin "purgamenta," to the
   same purpose, -- such as have all manner of filth cast upon them. And
   Isa. xliii. 3, they have rendered the same word allagma, "a commutation
   by price." So Matt. xvi. 26, Ti dosei anthropos antallagma tes psuches,
   "a price in exchange." Now, in all these places and others, the Hebrews
   use the word kphr?, "a propitiation," by way of allusion; as is most
   especially evident from that of Isaiah, "I will give Egypt a
   propitiation for thee." That is, as God is atoned by a propitiatory
   sacrifice, wherein something is offered him in the room of the
   offender, so will he do with them, -- put them into trouble in room of
   the church, as the sacrificed beast was in the room of him for whom it
   was sacrificed And hence does that word signify a ransom, because what
   God appointed in his worship to redeem any thing that by the law was
   devoted, which was a compensation by his institution (as a clean beast
   in the room of a first-born was to be offered a sacrifice to God), was
   so called. And the word "satisfaction," which is but once used in the
   Scripture, or twice together, Num. xxxv. 31, is kphr? in the original.
   kphr?, indeed, is originally "pitch" or "bitumen;" hence what God says
   to Noah about making the ark, vkphrt?, Gen. vi. 14, the LXX. have
   rendered asphaltoseis te asphalto, -- "bituminabis bitumine." kpr?. in
   pihel is "placavit, expiavit, expiationem fecit;" because by sacrifice
   sins are covered as if they had not been, to cover or hide being the
   first use of the word.

   And this is the rise and use of the word "ransom" in the Scripture,
   both pdyn?, pdh? and kphr?, which are rendered by lutron perikatharma
   antilutron allagma. It denotes properly a price of redemption, a
   valuable compensation made by one thing for another, either in the
   native signification, as in the case of the first word, or by the first
   translation of it from the sacrifice of atonement, as in the latter. Of
   this farther afterward, in the business of redemption. For the present
   it sufficeth that the death of Christ was a price of ransom, and these
   are the words whereby it is expressed.

   II. It was a sacrifice; and what sacrifice it was shall be declared:--

   That Christ offered a sacrifice is abundantly evident from what was
   said before, in the consideration of the time and place when and
   wherein Christ was a high priest. The necessity of this the apostle
   confirms, Heb. viii. 3, "For every high priest is ordained to offer
   both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man
   have somewhat also to offer." If he be a priest, he must have a
   sacrifice; the very nature of his employment requires it. The whole and
   entire office and employment of a high priest, as a priest, consists in
   offering sacrifice, with the performance of those things which did
   necessarily precede and follow that action. It is of necessity, then,
   that he should also have somewhat to offer as a sacrifice to God.

   For the other part of our inquiry, namely, what it was that he
   sacrificed, I shall manifest in this order of process (taking leave to
   enlarge a little in this, intending not so much the thing, proved
   before, as the manner of it):--

   1. He was not to offer any sacrifice that any priest had offered before
   by God's appointment; 2. He did not actually offer any such sacrifice;
   3. I shall show positively what he did offer. 1. He was not to offer
   any sacrifice that the priests of old had appointed for them to offer.
   He came to do another manner of work than could be brought about with
   the blood of bulls and goats. It cost more to redeem our souls. That
   which was of more worth in itself, of nearer concernment to him that
   offered it, of a more manifold alliance to them for whom it was
   offered, and of better acceptation with God, to whom it was offered,
   was to be his sacrifice. This is the aim of the Holy Ghost, Heb. x.
   1-7, "For the law." etc.

   This is the sum of the apostle's discourse: The sacrifices instituted
   by the law could not effect or work that which Christ, our high priest,
   was to accomplish by his sacrifice; and therefore he was not to offer
   them, but they were to be abolished, and something else to be brought
   in that might supply their room and defect.

   What was wanting in these sacrifices the apostle ascribes to the law
   whereby they were instituted. (1.) The law could not do it; that is,
   the ceremonial law could not do it. The law which instituted and
   appointed these sacrifices could not accomplish that end of the
   institution by them. And with this expression of it he subjoins a
   reason of this weakness of the law: "It had a shadow of good things to
   come, and not the very image of the things" themselves, -- an obscure
   representation of those good things which, when they were instituted
   and in force, were mellonta, to come, though now actually exhibited and
   existent; that is, Jesus Christ himself, and the good things of the
   gospel accompanying of him. It had but a "shadow" of these things, not
   the "image," -- that is, the substance of them; for so I had rather
   understand "image" here substantially, as that may be called the image
   of a picture by which it is drawn, than to make skia and eikon here to
   differ but gradually, [i.e., in degree,] as the first rude shape and
   proportion and the perfect limning of any thing do. The reason, then,
   why all the solemn, operose, burdensome service of old could not of
   itself take away sin, is because it did not contain Christ in it, but
   only had a shadow of him.

   (2.) The apostle instances, in particular, by what means the law could
   not do this great work of "making the comers thereunto perfect;" tous
   proserchomenous, -- that is, those who come to God by it, the
   worshippers; which is spoken in opposition to what is said of Christ,
   Heb. vii. 25, "He is able to save to the uttermost tous
   proserchomenous," those that come to God by him." The word expresseth
   any man under the consideration of one coming to God for acceptation;
   as chap. xi. 6, "He that cometh unto God," -- Dei ton proserchomenon.
   These it could not make perfect; that is, it could not perfectly atone
   God, and so take away their sins that the conscience should no more be
   troubled or tormented with the guilt of sin, as chap. x. 2-4. By what
   could not the law do this? By those sacrifices which it offered year by
   year continually.

   Not to speak of sacrifices in general, the sacrifices of the Jews may
   be referred to four heads:--

   (1.) The daily sacrifice of morning and evening, which is instituted
   Exod. xxix. 38, 39; which being omitted, was renewed by Neh. x. 33, and
   wholly taken away for a long season by Antiochus, according to the
   prophecy of Dan. xi. 31. This is the juge sacrificum, typifying
   Christ's constant presence with his church in the benefit of his death
   always.

   (2.) Voluntary and occasional, which had no prefixed time nor matter;
   so that they were of such creatures as God had allowed to be
   sacrificed, they were left to the will of the offerer, according as
   occasion and necessity were by providence administered. Now, of these
   sacrifices there was a peculiar reason, that did not, as far as I can
   find, belong unto any of the rest. The judicial government of that
   nation being, as their own historian, Josephus, calls it, Theokratia,
   and immediately in the hand of God, he appointed these voluntary
   sacrifices, which were a part of his religious worship, to have a place
   also in the judicial government of the people; for whereas he had
   appointed death to be the punishment due to every sin, he allowed that
   for many sins sacrifice should be offered for the expiating of the
   guilt contracted in that commonwealth of which himself was the
   governor. Thus for many sins of ignorance and weakness, and other
   perversities, sacrifice was offered, and the guilty person died not,
   according to the general tenor of the law, "Cursed is every one that
   continueth not in all these things." Hence David, in his great sin of
   murder and adultery, flees to mere mercy, acknowledging that God had
   appointed no sacrifice for the expiation of those sins as to the guilt
   political contracted in that commonwealth, though otherwise no sins nor
   sinners were excluded from the benefit of sacrifices, Ps. li. 16. This
   was their political regard; which they had and could have only on this
   account, that God was the supreme political governor of that people,
   their lord and king.

   (3.) Sacrifices extraordinary on solemn occasions, which seem some of
   them to be mixed of the two former kinds, stated and voluntary. Such
   was Solomon's great sacrifice at the dedication of the temple. These
   partly answered the sacrifice instituted at the dedication of the altar
   and tabernacle, partly the free-will offerings which God allowed the
   people, according to their occasions, and appointed them for them.

   (4.) Appointed sacrifices on solemn days; as on the sabbath, new moons,
   passover, feast of weeks, lesser and greater jubilee, but especially
   the solemn anniversary sacrifice of expiation, when the high priest
   entered into the holy place with the blood of the beast sacrificed, on
   the tenth day of the month Tisri. The institution of this sacrifice you
   have Lev. xvi. throughout. The matter of it was one bullock, and two
   goats, or kids of goats, verses 3, 5. The manner was this:-- [1.] In
   the entrance, Aaron offered one bullock peculiarly for himself and his
   house, verse 6. [2.] Lots were cast on the two goats, one to be a
   sin-offering, the other to be azazel, verses 8, 9. [3.] The bullock and
   goat being slain, the blood was carried into the holy place. [4.]
   Azazel, having all the sins of the people confessed over him, was sent
   into the wilderness to perish, verse 21. [5.] The end of this sacrifice
   was atonement and cleansing, verse 30. Of the whole nature, ends,
   significancy, and use of this sacrifice, as of others, elsewhere; at
   present I attend only to the thesis proposed.

   Now, if perfect atonement and expiation might be expected from any of
   the sacrifices so instituted by God, certainly it might be from this;
   therefore this doth the apostle choose to instance in This was the
   sacrifice offered kat eniauton and eis to dienekes. But these, saith
   he, could not do it; the law by them could not do it. And this he
   proves with two arguments:--

   1st. From the event: Heb. x. 2, 3, "For then would they not have ceased
   to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had
   no more conscience of sins. But in those sacrifices there was a
   remembrance again made of sins every year." The words of the second
   verse are to be read with an interrogation, conclusive in the negative:
   "Would they not have ceased to have been offered?" that is, certainly
   they would. And because they did not do so, it is evident from the
   event that they could not take away sin. In most copies the words are,
   Epei a epausanto prospheromenai. Those that add the negative particle
   ouk put it for ouchi,. as it is frequently used.

   2dly. From the nature of the thing itself: Verse 4, "For it was not
   possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins."
   The reason in these words is evident and plain, especially that of
   verse 4. There is a twofold impossibility in the thing:--

   (1st.) In regard of impetration. It was impossible they should really
   atone God, who was provoked. First, the conjunction between the sinner
   and the sacrificed beast was not such or so near (being only that of
   possessor and possessed) that really, and beyond representation and
   type, the blood of the one could satisfy for the sin of the other. Much
   less, secondly, was there an innate worth of the blood of any beast,
   though never so innocent, to atone the justice of God, that was
   offended at sin, Mic. vi. 6, 7. Nor, thirdly, was there any will in
   them for such an undertaking or commutation. The sacrifice was bound
   with cords to the horns of the altar; Christ went willingly to the
   sacrifice of himself.

   (2dly.) In regard of application. The blood of common sacrifices being
   once shed was a dead thing, and had no more worth nor efficacy; it
   could not possibly be a "living way" for us to come to God by, nor
   could it be preserved to be sprinkled upon the conscience of the
   sinner.

   Hence doth the apostle make it evident, in the first place, that Christ
   was not to offer any of the sacrifices which former priests had
   offered, first, Because it was utterly impossible that by such
   sacrifices the end of the sacrifice which he was to offer should be
   accomplished. This also he proves, secondly, Because God had expressly
   disallowed those sacrifices as to that end. Not only it was impossible
   in the nature of the thing itself, but also God had absolutely rejected
   the tender of them as to the taking away sin and bringing sinners to
   God.

   But it may be said, "Did not God appoint them for that end and purpose,
   as was spoken before? The end of the sacrifice in the day of expiation
   was to atone and cleanse: Lev. xvi. 30, On that day shall the priest
   make an atonement for you, to cleanse you' (for the priest made an
   atonement actively, by offering the sacrifice; the sacrifice itself
   passively, by undergoing the penalty of death: Christ, who was both
   priest and sacrifice, did both.)" I answer, They were never appointed
   of God to accomplish that end by any real worth and efficacy of their
   own, but merely to typify, prefigure, and point out, him and that which
   did the work which they represented; and so served, as the apostle
   speaks, "until the time of reformation," Heb. ix. 10. They served the
   use of that people in the under-age condition wherein God was pleased
   to keep them.

   But now that God rejected them as to this end and purpose, the apostle
   proves by the testimony of David, speaking of the acceptance of Christ:
   Ps. xl. 6, 7, "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears
   hast thou opened: burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not
   required. Then said I, Lo, I come," etc.; which the apostle insists on,
   Heb. x. 5-9. There are several accounts upon which God in Scripture is
   said to disregard and not to approve or accept of sacrifices which yet
   were of his own institution:-- First, In respect of the hypocrisy of
   the offerers. That people being grown formal and corrupt, trusted in
   sacrifices and the work wrought in them, and said that by them they
   should be justified: God, expressing his indignation against such
   sacrifices, or the sacrifices of such persons, rejects the things
   themselves wherein they trusted, that is, in reference to them that
   used them. This is the intention of the Holy Ghost, Isa. i. 12, 13. But
   this is not the cause of their rejection in this place of the psalmist,
   for he speaketh of them who walked with God in uprightness and waited
   for his salvation, even of himself and other saints, as appears in the
   context, verse 1, etc. Secondly, Comparatively. They are rejected as to
   the outward work of them, in comparison of his more spiritual worship,
   as Ps. l. 12-14. But neither are they here rejected on that account,
   nor is there mention of any opposition between the outward worship of
   sacrifice and any other more spiritual and internal part thereof, but
   between sacrifice and the boring of the ears, or preparing of the body
   of Christ, as expressly, verse 6.

   Their rejection, then, here mentioned, is in reference to that which is
   asserted in opposition to them, and in reference to the end for which
   that is asserted. Look to what end Christ had a body fitted and
   prepared, for and to that end, and the compassing of it, are all
   sacrifices rejected of God. Now, this was to take away sin, so that as
   to that end are they rejected.

   And here, in our passage, may we remove what the Racovian Catechism
   gives us as the difference between the expiation under the old
   testament and that under the new; concerning which, cap. de Mun. Chris.
   Sacer. q. 5, they thus inquire:--

   Q. What is the difference between the expiation of sin in the old and
   new testament?

   A. The expiation of sins under the new testament is not only much
   different from that under the old, but also is far better and more
   excellent; and that chiefly for two causes. The first is, that under
   the old testament, expiation by those legal sacrifices was appointed
   only for those sins which happened upon imprudence and infirmity; from
   whence they were also called infirmities and ignorances: but for
   greater sins, such as were manifest transgressions of the command of
   God, there were no sacrifices instituted, but the punishment of death
   was proposed to them; and if God did forgive such to any, he did not do
   it by virtue of the covenant, but of singular mercy, which God, beside
   the covenant, did afford when and to whom he would. But under the new
   covenant, not only those sins are expiated which happen by imprudence
   and infirmity, but those also which are transgressions of most evident
   commands of God, whilst he who happened so to fall doth not continue
   therein, but is changed by true repentance, and falleth not into that
   sin again. The latter cause is, because under the old testament
   expiation of sins was so performed that only temporal punishment was
   taken away from them whose sins were expiated; but under the new the
   expiation is such as not only takes away temporal but eternal
   punishment, and in their stead offers eternal life, promised in the
   covenant, to them whose sins are expiated. [463]

   Thus they. Some brief animadversions will give the reader a clear
   account of this discourse:-- Sundry things are here splendidly supposed
   by our catechists, than which nothing could be imagined or invented
   more false; as, that the covenant was not the same for substance under
   the old and new testament, before and after the coming of Christ in the
   flesh; that those under the old testament were not pardoned or saved by
   Christ; that death temporal was all that was threatened by the law;
   that God forgave sin, and not in or by the covenant; that there were no
   promises of eternal life under the old testament, etc. On these and the
   like goodly principles is this whole discourse erected. Let us now
   consider their assertions.

   The first is, That expiation by legal sacrifices was only for some
   sins, and not for all, as sins of infirmity and ignorance, not great
   crimes: wherein, First, They suppose that the legal sacrifices did by
   themselves and their own efficacy expiate sin; which is directly
   contrary to the discourse of the apostle now insisted on. Secondly,
   Their affirmation hereon is most false. Aaron, making an atonement for
   sin, "confessed over the goat all the iniquities of the children of
   Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins," Lev. xvi. 21;
   and, besides, all manner of sins are comprised under these expressions,
   "ignorances and infirmities."

   Secondly, They say, "For greater sins there was then no expiation, but
   death was threatened to them." But, First, Then none that ever
   committed such sins were saved; for without expiation there is no
   salvation. Secondly, Death was threatened and inflicted without mercy
   for some sins, as the law with its judicial additaments was the rule of
   the judaical polity, and for those sins there was no sacrifice for a
   deliverance from death temporal; but death was threatened to every sin,
   small and great, as the law was a rule of moral obedience unto God; and
   so in respect of sacrifices there was no distinction. This difference
   of sacrifices for some sins, and not for others, in particular, did
   depend merely on their use by God's appointment in the commonwealth of
   that people, and had no regard to the spiritual expiation of sin, which
   they typified.

   Thirdly, That God forgave the sins of his people of old by singular
   mercy, and not by virtue of his covenant, is a bold figment. God
   exercises no singular mercy but in the covenant thereof, Eph. ii. 12.

   Fourthly, Their condition of expiation (by the way) under the new
   testament, "That the sinner fall not again into the same sin," is a
   matter that these men understand not; but this is no place to discuss
   it.

   Fifthly, That the expiation under the old testament reached only to the
   removal of temporal punishment is another imagination of our
   catechists. It was death eternal that was threatened as the punishment
   due to the transgression of the law, as it was the rule of obedience to
   God, as hath been proved, even the death that Christ delivered us from,
   Rom. v. 12, etc.; Heb. ii. 14, 15. God was atoned by those sacrifices,
   according to their way of making atonement, Lev. xvi. 30; so that the
   punishment avoided was eternal-punishment. Neither is this, indeed,
   spoken by our catechists as though they believed any punishment should
   be eternal; but they only hide themselves in the ambiguity of the
   expression, it being annihilation they intend thereby. The proton
   pseudos of this discourse is, that expiation by sacrifices was no other
   than what was done really by the sacrifices themselves; so everting
   their typical nature and institution, and divesting them of the
   efficacy of the blood of Christ, which they did represent.

   Sixthly, It is confessed that there is a difference between the
   expiation under the old testament and that under the new, but this is
   of application and manifestation, not of impetration and procurement.
   This is "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever." But
   they plead proof of Scripture for what they say, in the ensuing
   question:--

   Q. How dost thou demonstrate both these?

   A. That the sins which could not be expiated under the old testament
   are all expiated under the new, Paul witnesseth, Acts xiii. 38, 39; and
   the same is also affirmed Rom. iii. 25, Heb. ix. 15: but that sins are
   so expiated under the new testament as that also eternal punishment is
   removed, and life eternal given, we have Heb. ix. 12. [464]

   This work will speedily be at an issue. First, It is denied that Paul,
   Acts xiii. 38, 39, makes a distinction of sins, whereof some might be
   expiated by Moses' law, and others not. He says no more there than in
   this place to the Hebrews, -- namely, that the legal sacrifices,
   wherein they rested and trusted, could not of themselves free them or
   their consciences from sin, or give them peace with God, being but
   types and shadows of good things to come, the body being Christ, by
   whom alone all justification from sin is to be obtained. Absolutely,
   the sacrifices of the law expiated no sin, and so were they rested in
   by the Jews; typically, they expiated all, and so Paul calls them from
   them to the antitype (or rather thing typified), now actually
   exhibited.

   Secondly, The two next places, of Rom. iii. 25, Heb. ix. 15, do
   expressly condemn the figment they strive to establish by them, both of
   them assigning the pardon of sins that were past and their expiation
   unto the blood and sacrifice of Christ. Though there were, then,
   purifications, purgations, sacrifices, yet the meritorious and
   efficient cause of all expiation was the blood of Christ; which
   manifests the expiation under the old and new testament for substance
   to have been the same.

   Thirdly, That the expiation under the new testament is accompanied with
   deliverance from eternal punishment and a grant of life eternal is
   confessed; and so also was that under the old, or it was no expiation
   at all, that had respect neither to God nor the souls of men. But to
   proceed with the sacrifice of Christ.

   This is the first thing I proposed: Christ being to offer sacrifice,
   was not to offer the sacrifices of the priests of old, because they
   could never bring about what he aimed at in his sacrifice. It was
   impossible in the nature of the thing itself, and they were expressly
   as to that end rejected of God himself.

   2. Christ as a priest did never offer those sacrifices. It is true, as
   one made under the law, and whom it became to fulfil all righteousness,
   he was present at them; but as a priest he never offered them: for the
   apostle expressly affirms that he could not be a priest that had right
   to offer those sacrifices (as before); and he positively refuses the
   owning himself for such a priest, when, having cured the leprous man,
   he bade him go show himself to the priest, according to the law.

   3. What Christ did offer indeed, as his sacrifice, is nextly to be
   mentioned. This the apostle expresseth in that which is asserted in
   opposition to the sacrifices rejected: Heb. x. 5, "But a body hast thou
   prepared me."

   The words in the psalm are in the sound of them otherwise: Ps. xl. 6,
   'znym kryt ly?; -- "Mine ears hast thou digged;" which the LXX. render,
   and the apostle from them, Soma katertiso moi, -- "A body hast thou
   prepared me." Of the accommodation of the interpretation to the
   original there is much contention. Some think here is an allusion to
   the custom among the Jews of boring the ear of him who was, upon his
   own consent, to be a servant for ever. Now, because Christ took a body
   to be obedient and a servant to his Father, this is expressed by the
   boring of the ear; which therefore the LXX. render by "preparing a
   body" wherein he might be so obedient. But this to me seems too curious
   on the part of the allusion, and too much strained on the part of the
   application; and therefore I shall not insist on it.

   Plainly, krh? signifies not only, in its first sense, to "dig," but
   also to "prepare;" and is so rendered by the LXX. Now, whereas the
   original expresseth only the ears, which are the organ by which we hear
   and become obedient (whence to hear is sometimes as much as to be
   obedient), it mentions the ears synecdochically for the whole body,
   which God so prepared for obedience to himself; and that which the
   original expressed synecdochically, the LXX., and after them the
   apostle, rendered more plainly and fully, naming the whole body wherein
   he obeyed, when the ears were only expressed, whereby he learned
   obedience.

   The interpretation of this place by the Socinians is as ridiculous as
   any they make use of. Take it in the words of Volkelius:--

   Add hereto that the mortal body of Christ, which he had before his
   death, yea, before his ascension into heaven, was not fit for his
   undergoing this office of priesthood or wholly to accomplish the
   sacrifice; wherefore the divine writer to the Hebrews, chap. x. 5,
   declareth that then he had a perfect body, accommodated unto this work,
   when he went into the world that is to come, which is heaven. [465]

   A heap of foolish imaginations! First, The truth is, no body but a
   mortal body was fit to be this sacrifice, which was to be accomplished,
   according to all the types of it, by shedding of blood; without which
   there is no remission. Secondly, It is false that Christ had a mortal
   body after his resurrection, or that he hath any other body now in
   heaven than what he rose withal. Thirdly, It is false that "the world,"
   spoken of simply, doth anywhere signify the world to come, or that "the
   world" here signifies heaven. Fourthly, It is false that the coming
   into the world signifies going out of the world, as it is here
   interpreted. Fifthly, Christ's bringing into the world was by his
   incarnation and birth, Heb. i. 6, according to the constant use of that
   expression in the Scripture; as his ascension is his leaving the world
   and going to his Father, John xiii. 1, xiv. 12, xvi. 28.

   But I must not insist on this. It is the body that God prepared Christ
   for his obedience, -- that is, his whole human nature, -- that is
   asserted for the matter of Christ's offering; for the clearing whereof
   the reader may observe that the matter of the offering and sacrifice of
   Christ is expressed three ways:--

   (1.) It is said to be of the body and blood of Christ, Heb. x. 10. The
   offering of the body of Jesus and the blood of Christ is said to purge
   us from our sins, that is, by the sacrifice of it, and in his blood
   have we redemption, Eph. i. 7, 1 John i. 7; and by his own blood did he
   enter into the holy place, Heb. ix. 12, and most expressly chap. xiii.
   12.

   (2.) His soul: Isa. liii. 10, "When thou shalt make his soul an
   offering for sin."

   (3.) It is most frequently said to be himself that was offered, Eph. v.
   2, Heb. i. 3, ix. 14, 25, 26, vii. 27. Hence it appears what was the
   matter of the sacrifice of this high priest, even himself: he
   sacrificed himself, -- his whole human nature; he offered up his body
   and soul as a propitiatory sacrifice to God, a sacrifice for atonement
   and expiation.

   Farther to clear this, I must desire the reader to take notice of the
   import of this expression, "He sacrificed himself," or Christ
   sacrificed himself. "He," in the first place, as it is spoken of the
   sacrificer, denotes the person of Christ, and both natures therein;
   "himself," as the sacrificed, is only the human nature of Christ,
   wherein and whereof that sacrifice was made. He makes the atonement
   actively, as the priest; himself passively, as the sacrifice:--

   [1.] "He" is the person of Christ, God and man jointly and distinctly
   acting in the work:--

   1st. As God: Heb. ix. 14, "Through the eternal Spirit he offered
   himself to God." His eternal Spirit or Deity was the principal agent,
   offering; and wherever there is mention of Christ's offering himself,
   it relates principally to the person, God-man, who offered.

   2dly. The free will of his human nature was in it also; so Heb. x. 7,
   "Lo, I come to do thy will." When God had prepared him a body, opened
   his ears, he says, "Lo, I come to do thy will," as it was written of
   him in the volume of God's book. And that this expression, "Lo, I come
   to do thy will," sets out the readiness of the human will of Christ, is
   evident from that exposition which is given of it, Ps. xl. 8, "Yea, thy
   law is within my heart," or "in the midst of my bowels;" -- "Thy law,
   the law of the mediator, that I am to undertake, it is in the midst of
   my heart;" which is an expression of the greatest readiness and
   willingness possible.

   He, then, that offers is our mediator, God and man in one person; and
   the offering is the act of the person.

   [2.] "Himself," offered as the matter of the sacrifice, is only the
   human nature of Christ, soul and body, as was said; which is evident
   from the description of a sacrifice, what it is.

   A sacrifice is a religious oblation, wherein something by the ministry
   of a priest, appointed of God thereunto, is dedicated to God, and
   destroyed as to what it was, for the ends and purposes of spiritual
   worship whereunto it is instituted. I shall only take notice of that
   one part of this definition, which asserts that the thing sacrificed
   was to be destroyed as to what it was. This is clear from all the
   sacrifices that ever were; either they were slain, or burned, or sent
   to destruction. Now, the person of Christ was not dissolved, but the
   union of his natures continued, even then when the human nature was in
   itself destroyed by the separation of soul and body. It was the soul
   and body of Christ that was sacrificed, his body being killed and his
   soul separated; so that at that season it was destroyed as to what it
   was, though it was impossible he should be detained by death.

   And this sacrifice of Christ was typified by the two goats: his body,
   whose blood was shed, by the goat that was slain visibly; and his soul
   by azazel, on whose head the sins of the people were confessed, and he
   sent away into the wilderness, to suffer there by a fall or famishment.

   This also will farther appear in our following consideration of the
   death of Christ as a punishment, when I shall show that he suffered
   both in soul and body.

   But it may be said, "If only the human nature of Christ was offered,
   how could it be a sacrifice of such infinite value as to [satisfy] the
   justice of God for all the sins of all the elect, whereunto it was
   appointed?"

   Ans. Though the thing sacrificed was but finite, yet the person
   sacrificing was infinite, and the apotelesma of the action follows the
   agent, that is, our mediator, Theanthropos, -- whence the sacrifice was
   of infinite value.

   And this is the second consideration of the death of Christ, -- it was
   a sacrifice. What is the peculiar influence of his death as a sacrifice
   into the satisfaction he hath made shall be declared afterward.

   From what hath been spoken, a brief description of the sacrifice of
   Christ, as to all the concernments of it, may be taken:--

   1. The person designing, appointing, and instituting this sacrifice, is
   God the Father, as in grace contriving the great work of the salvation
   of the elect. "A body did he prepare him;" and therein "he came to do
   his will," Heb. x. 5, 7, in that which he did, which the sacrifices of
   old could not do. He came to fulfil the will of God, his appointment
   and ordinance, being his servant therein, made brachuti less than the
   Father, that he might be obedient to death. God the Father sent him
   when he made his soul an offering.

   2. He to whom it was offered was God, God essentially considered, with
   his glorious property of justice, which was to be atoned: "He gave
   himself an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling
   savour," Eph. v. 2; that is, to atone him, being provoked, as we shall
   see afterward.

   3. The person offering was Christ, the mediator, God and man: "He
   offered himself to God," Heb. ix. 14. And because he did it who was God
   and man, and as God and man, God is said to "redeem his church with his
   own blood," Acts xx. 28.

   4. The matter of the sacrifice was his whole human nature, body and
   soul, called "himself," as I have showed in sundry particulars.

   5. The immediate efficient cause of his offering, and the destruction
   of that which he offered unto God, as before described, was his own
   will: "Lo, I come," saith he, "to do thy will," Heb. x. 7; and, "No
   man," saith he, "taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of myself: I
   have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again," John x.
   18. What men and devils did to him, or what he suffered from the curse
   of the law, comes under another consideration, -- as his death was a
   penalty; as it was a sacrifice, his own will was all the cause
   immediately effecting it.

   6. The fire that was to set this holocaust on a flame was the Holy
   Spirit: Heb. ix. 14, "Through the Eternal Spirit." That the fire which
   came down from heaven and was always kept alive upon the altar was a
   type of the Holy Ghost might easily be demonstrated. I have done it
   elsewhere. Now, the Holy Spirit did this in Christ; he was offered
   through the Eternal Spirit, as others were by fire.

   7. The Scripture speaks nothing of the altar on which Christ was
   offered; some assign the cross. That of our Saviour is abundantly
   sufficient to evince the folly thereof, Matt. xxiii. 18, 19. If the
   cross was the altar, it was greater than Christ, and sanctified him;
   which is blasphemy. Besides, Christ himself is said to be an altar,
   Heb. xiii. 10; and he is said to sanctify himself to be an offering or
   a sacrifice, John xvii. 19. So that, indeed, the deity of Christ, that
   supported, bore up, and sanctified the human nature as offered, was the
   altar, and the cross was but an instrument of the cruelty of man, that
   taketh place in the death of Christ as it was a penalty, but hath no
   place in it as a sacrifice.

   That this sacrifice of Christ was a sacrifice of propitiation, as made
   by blood, as answering the typical sacrifices of old, and that the end
   and effect of it was atonement or reconciliation, shall elsewhere be
   more fully manifested; the discovery of it, also, will in part be made
   by what in the ensuing discourse shall be spoken about reconciliation
   itself.

   præstantior et excellentior est: id vero duabus potissimum de causis.

Chapter XXIII.

   Of the death of Christ as it was a punishment, and the satisfaction
   made thereby.

   So is the death of Christ revealed as a price and a sacrifice. What are
   the proper effects of it under these considerations shall be afterward
   declared.

   III. The third consideration of it is its being a penalty or a
   punishment. To clear this I shall demonstrate four things: 1. What
   punishment, properly so called, is; 2. That Christ's death was a
   punishment, or that in his death he did undergo punishment; 3. What
   that was that Christ underwent, or the material cause of that
   punishment; 4. Wherein the formality of its being a punishment did
   consist, or whence that dispensation had its equity.

   For the first, I shall give, 1. The definition of it, or the
   description of its general nature; 2. The ends of it are to be
   considered.

   1. For the first, that usual general description seemeth to be
   comprehensive of the whole nature of punishment; it is "malum passionis
   quod infligitur ob malum actionis," -- an evil of suffering inflicted
   for doing evil. Or, more largely to describe it, it is an effect of
   justice in him who hath sovereign power and right to order and dispose
   of offenders, whereby he that doth contrary to the rule of his actions
   is recompensed with that which is evil to himself, according to the
   demerit of his fault. [466]

   (1.) It is an effect of justice. [467] Hence God's punishing is often
   called an inflicting of anger; as Rom. iii. 5, "Is God unrighteous, ho
   epipheron ten orgen, who inflicteth anger?" Anger is put for the
   justice of God, Rom. i. 18, "The anger (or wrath) of God is revealed
   from heaven," etc.; that is, his vindictive justice against sin is
   manifested by its effects. And again, the cause [is put] for the
   effect, manger for the effect of it in punishment; and therefore we
   have translated the word "vengeance," Rom. iii. 5, which denotes the
   punishment itself.

   (2.) It is of him who hath sovereign power and judiciary right to
   dispose of the offenders: and this is either immediate in God himself,
   as in the case whereof we speak, -- he is the "only lawgiver, who is
   able to save and to destroy," James iv. 12, -- or it is by him
   delegated to men for the use of human society; so Christ tells Pilate,
   he could have no power over him (whom he considered as a malefactor)
   unless it were given him from above, John xix. 11, though that is
   spoken in reference to that peculiar dispensation.

   (3.) The nature of it consists in this, that it be evil to him on whom
   it is inflicted, either by the immission of that which is corrupting,
   vexing, and destroying, or the subtraction of that which is cheering,
   useful, good, and desirable, in what kind soever; and therefore did the
   ancients call the punishment "fraus," because when it came upon men,
   they had deceived and cut short themselves of some good that otherwise
   they might have enjoyed. So the historian: "Cæteræ multitudini diem
   statuit, ante quam liceret sine fraude ab armis discedere;" that is,
   that they might go away freely without punishment. [468] And so is that
   expression explained by Ulpian, Dig. lib. xx.: "Capitalem fraudem
   admittere est tale aliquid delinquere, propter quod capite puniendus
   sit."

   The schoolmen have two rules that pass amongst them without control:--
   First, that "Omne peccatum est adeo voluntarium, ut si non sit
   voluntarium non est peccatum." It is so of the nature of sin that it be
   voluntary, that if any thing be not voluntary, it is not sin. The other
   is, "Est ex natura poenæ ut sit involuntaria." It is so of the nature
   of punishment that it be against the will of him that is punished, that
   if it be not so, it is not punishment.

   Neither of which rules is true, yea, the latter is undoubtedly false.

   For the former, every sin is thus far, indeed, voluntary, that what is
   done contrary to the express will of him that doth it is not his sin;
   but that the actual will or willing of the sinner is required to make
   any thing his sin is false, -- in the case of original sin manifestly.
   Wherefore John gives us another definition of sin than theirs is, that
   it is "dictum, factum, concupitum, contra legem," -- namely, that it is
   anomia, "a transgression of the law." Have it the actual consent of the
   will or no, if it be a transgression of the law, an inconformity to the
   law, it is sin.

   For the latter, it is true, indeed, that for the most part it falls out
   that every one that is to be punished is unwilling to undergo it, and
   there is an improper nolleity (if I may so speak) in nature unto the
   subtracting of any good from it, or the immission of any evil upon it;
   yet as to the perfection of the nature of punishment, there is no more
   required than what was laid down in general before, that there be
   "malum passionis ob malum actionis," -- a suffering of evil for doing
   of evil, whether men will or no: yea, men may be willing to it, as the
   soldiers of Cæsar, after their defeat at Dyrrachium, came to him and
   desired that they might be punished "more antiquo," being ashamed of
   their flight. [469] But whatever really or personally is evil to a man
   for his evil, is punishment. Though chiefly among the Latins
   "punishment" relates to things real, capital revenges had another name.
   Punishments were chiefly pecuniary, as Servius on that of Virgil, Æn.
   i. 140: "?Post mihi non simili poena commissa luetis.' Luetis,
   persolvetis, et hic sermo a pecunia descendit, antiquorum enim poenæ
   omnes pecuniariæ fuerunt." And "supplicium" is of the same importance.
   Punishments were called "supplicia," because with the mulcts of men
   they sacrificed and made their supplications to God: whence the word is
   sometimes used for that worship, as in Sallustius; describing the old
   Romans, he says they were "in suppliciis deorum magnifici," Bell. Cat.
   cap. ix.

   (4.) There is the procuring cause of it, which is doing evil, contrary
   to the law and rule whereby the offender ought to walk and regulate his
   actings and proceedings. "Omnis poena, si justa est, peccati poena
   est," says Augustine; indeed, not only "si justa est," but "si poena
   est." Taking it properly, offence must precede punishment. And whatever
   evil befalls any that is not procured by offence is, not properly
   punishment, but hath some other name and nature. The name "poena" is
   used for any thing that is vexatious or troublesome, any toil or
   labour; as in the tragedian, speaking of one who tired himself with
   travel in hunting, "Quid to ipse poenis gravibus infestus gravas:"
   [470] but improperly is it thus used. This Abraham evinceth in his plea
   with God, Gen. xviii. 25, "That be far from thee to do after this
   manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous
   should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of
   all the earth do right?" It is God as the judge of all the earth of
   whom he speaks; that is, of him that hath the supreme power of
   disposing of offenders; and of his justice inflicting, which, as I
   said, was the cause of punishment. It is that whereby God doth right.
   And he gives the procuring cause of all punishment, -- the wickedness
   of men: "That be far from thee, to slay the righteous with the wicked."
   And therefore that place of Job, chap. ix. 22, "This is one thing,
   therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked," is not
   to be understood absolutely, but according to the subject of the
   dispute in hand between him and Bildad. Bildad says, chap. viii. 20,
   that "God will not cast away a perfect man;" that is, he will not
   afflict a godly man to death, he grants that a godly man may be
   afflicted, which Eliphaz' companion seemed to deny; yet, says he, he
   will not cast him away, -- that is, leave him without relief from that
   affliction, even in this life. To this Job's answer is, "This is one
   thing," -- that is, "One thing I am resolved on," -- "and therefore I
   said it," and will abide by it, "He destroyeth the perfect and the
   wicked." Not only wicked men are destroyed and cut off in this life,
   but perfect men also; but yet in this very destruction, as there is a
   difference in the persons, one being perfect, the other wicked, so
   there is in God's dealing with them, one being afflicted to the door of
   heaven, the other cursed into hell. But for punishment, properly so
   called, the cause is sin, or the offence of the person punished; and
   therefore in the Hebrew, the same words (many of them) signify both sin
   and punishment, -- so near and indissoluble is their relation! Prosekei
   depouthen hos chrea kleronomias diadechesthai tes ponerias ten kolasin,
   Plut. de Sera Numin. Vindicta.

   (5.) The measure of any penalty is the demerit of the offence; it is a
   rendering to men, as for their works, so according to them:--


   "Nec vincet ratio hoc, tantundem ut peccet idemque,

   Qui teneros caules alieni fregerit horti

   Et qui nocturnus Divum sacra legerit. Adsit

   Regula, peccatis quæ poenas irroget æquas:

   Ne scutica dignum horribili sectere flagello." [471]

   I shall not trouble the reader with the heathens' apprehension of
   Rhadamanthean righteousness, and the exact rendering to every one
   according to his desert, even in another world.

   There is a twofold rule of this proportion of sin and punishment, the
   one constitutive, the other declarative. The rule constitutive of the
   proportion of penalty for sin is the infinitely wise, holy, and
   righteous will of God; the rule declarative of it is the law.

   For the first, it is his judgment "that they which commit sin are
   worthy of death," Rom. i. 32. This the apostle fully declares, chap.
   ii. 5-11. The day of punishing he calls "The day of the revelation of
   the righteous judgment of God;" that is, what his judgment is
   concerning the demerit of sin. The world shall then know what in
   justice he requires for the due vengeance of it, and this according to
   his will. Verse 6, he will, in his righteous judgment, render to every
   one according to his deeds.

   And here it is to be observed, that though there be an exceeding great
   variation in sin in respect of degrees, so that some seem as mountains,
   others in comparison of them but as mole-hills, yet it is the general
   nature of sin (which is the creature's subducting itself from under the
   dominion of God and dependence upon him) that punishment originally is
   suited unto; whence death is appointed to every sin, and that eternal,
   wherein the degrees of punishment vary, not the kind.

   2. For the several kinds of punishment (I call them so in a general
   acceptation of both words), they are distinguished according to their
   ends and causes. [472] The ends of punishments, or of all such things
   as have in them the nature of punishments, may be referred to the
   ensuing heads:--

   (1.) The first end of punishment is the good of him that is punished;
   and this is twofold:--

   [1.] For amendment and recovery from the evil and sin that he hath
   committed. This kind of punishing is frequently mentioned in Scripture:
   so eminently, Lev. xxvi., doth the Lord describe it at large, and
   insist upon it, reckoning up in a long series a catalogue of several
   judgments, he interposing, "But if ye will not be reformed by me by
   these things, but will walk contrary to me" (as verse 23), "then will I
   do so and so," or add this or that punishment to them foregoing; and
   this in reference to the former end, of their reformation. And the
   success of this procedure we find variously expressed. Sometimes the
   end of it in some measure was fulfilled, Ps. lxxviii. 32-35; sometimes
   otherwise, Isa. i. 5, "Why should ye be smitten any more? ye will
   revolt more and more," intimating that the end of the former smiting
   was to cure their revoltings. And this kind of punishment is called
   nouthesia, [473] correction for instruction, and is not punishment in
   its strict and proper sense.

   [2.] For the taking off of sinners, to prevent such other wickednesses
   as they would commit, should patience be exercised towards them. The
   very heathen saw that he that was wicked and not to be reclaimed, it
   was even good for him and to him that he should be destroyed. Such an
   one, as Plutarch says, was heterois ge pantos blaberon auto te
   blaberotaton -- "hurtful to others, but most of all to himself." How
   much more is this evident to us, who know that future judgments shall
   be proportionably increased to the wickedness of men in this world! And
   if every drop of judgment in the world to come be incomparably greater
   than the greatest and heaviest a man can possibly suffer in this life
   or lose his life by, it is most evident that a man may be punished with
   death for his own good, "mitius punientur." This is kolasia. And this
   hath no place in human administrations of punishments when they arise
   to death itself. Men cannot kill a man to prevent their dealing worse
   with him, for that is their worst; they can do no more, says our
   Saviour: but accidentally it may be for his good. Generally, kolasis or
   kolasia is, as Aristotle speaks, paschontos heneka, and is thereby
   differenced from timoria (of which afterward), which, as he says, is
   tou ponountos henelka hina apoplerothe. [474] Hence akolastos is one
   not corrected, not restrained, "incastigatus." And therefore the
   punishment of death cannot at all properly be kolasis: but cutting off
   by God to prevent farther sin hath in it ti analogon thereunto.

   (2.) The second end of punishment, which gives a second kind of them,
   in the general sense before mentioned, is for the good of others, and
   this also is various:--

   [1.] It is for the good of them that may be like-minded with him that
   is punished, that they may be deterred, affrighted, and persuaded from
   the like evils This was the end of the punishing of the presumptuous
   sinner, Deut. xvii. 12, 13, "That man shall die; and all the people
   shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously." "The people;"
   that is, any among them that were like-minded unto him that was stoned
   and destroyed. So in some places they have taken lions that have
   destroyed men, and hung them on crosses, to fright others that should
   attempt the like. Hence "exemplum" is sometimes put absolutely for
   punishment, because punishment is for that end. So in the comedian,
   "Quæ futura exempla dicunt in eum indigna;" [475] on which place
   Donatus, "Graves poenæ, quæ possunt cæteris documento esse, exempla
   dicuntur." And this is a tacit end in human punishment. I do not know
   that God hath committed any pure revenge unto men, -- that is,
   punishing with a mere respect to what is past; nor should one man
   destroy another but for the good of others Now, the good of no man lies
   in revenge. The content that men take therein is their sin, and cannot
   be absolutely good to them. So the philosopher: "Nemo prudens punit
   quia peccatum est, sed ne peccetur: revocari enim præterita non
   possunt, futura prohibeantur;" [476] and Rom. xiii. 4, "If thou do that
   which is evil, be afraid," etc.; -- "See what he hath done to others,
   and be afraid."

   [2.] It is for the good of others, that they may not be hurt in the
   like kind as some were by the sin of him who is punished for it. This
   seems to be the main end of that great fundamental law of human
   society, "Let him that hath killed by violence be killed, that the rest
   of men may live in peace." [477]

   And these kinds of punishments, in reference to this end, are called
   paradeigmata, "examples," [478] that others by impunity be not enticed
   to evil, and that the residue of men may be freed from the harm that is
   brought upon them by reason of such evils.

   Hence the historian says, that commonwealths should rather be mindful
   of things done evilly than of good turns. The forgetfulness of the
   latter is a discouragement to some good, but of the former an
   encouragement to all licentiousness. Thus Joseph suspecting his
   espoused consort, yet refused paradeigmatisai to make an open example
   of her by punishment, Matt. i. 19. And these punishments are thus
   called from their use, and not from their own nature; and therefore
   differ not from kolasiai, and timoriai, but only as to the end and use,
   from whence they have their denomination." [479]

   [3.] The good of him that punisheth is aimed at; and this is proper to
   God. Man punisheth not, nor can, nor ought, for his own good, or the
   satisfaction of his own justice; but "the Lord made all things for
   himself, yea, even the wicked for the day of evil," Prov. xvi. 4, Rom.
   ix. 22: and in God's dealing with men, whatever he doth, unless it be
   for this end, it is not properly punishment.

   This is timoria, "vindicta noxæ," purely the recompensing of the evil
   that is committed, that it may be revenged. This, I say, in God's
   dealing is properly punishment, the revenge of the evil done, that
   himself or his justice may be satisfied; as was seen before from Rom.
   ii. 5-11. Whatever of evil God doth to any, -- which is therefore
   called "punishment," because it partaketh of the general nature of
   punishment, and is evil to him that is punished, -- yet if the
   intendment of God be not to revenge the evil past upon him in a
   proportion of law, it is not punishment properly so called; and
   therefore it will not suffice, to prove that believers are or may be
   punished for sin, to heap up texts of Scripture where they are said to
   be punished, and that in reference to their sin, unless it can be also
   proved that God doth it "animo ulciscendi," and that their punishment
   is "vindicta noxæ," and that it is done tou ponountos heneka hina
   apoplerothe: but of this I am not now to treat.

   The reader may hence see what punishment is in general, what are the
   ends of it, and its kinds from thence, and what is punishment from God,
   properly so called. It is "vindicta noxæ, animo ulciscendi, ut ipsi
   satisfiat:" and this kind of punishment was the death of Christ; which
   is to be proved.

   Secondly, That the death of Christ was a punishment properly so called
   (which is the third consideration of it, as I said), is next to be
   proved. Of all the places of Scripture and testimonies whereby this may
   be demonstrated, I shall fix only on one portion of Scripture, and that
   is Isa. liii. What in particular shall be produced from thence will
   appear when I have given some general considerations of the chapter;
   which I shall do at large, as looking on that portion of Scripture as
   the sum of what is spoken in the Old Testament concerning the
   satisfactory death of Jesus Christ.

   1. This whole prophecy, from verse 13 of chap. lii., which is the head
   of the present discourse, is evinced to belong to the Messiah, against
   the Jews:--

   (1.) Because the Chaldee paraphrast, one of their most ancient masters,
   expressly names the Messiah, and interprets that whole chapter of him:
   "Behold," saith he, "my servant, the Messiah, shall deal prudently."
   And the ancient rabbins, as is abundantly proved by others, were of the
   same mind: which miserably entangles their present obdurate masters,
   who would fix the prophecy upon any rather than on the Messiah, seeing
   evidently that if it be proved to belong to the Messiah in thesi, it
   can be applied to none other in hypothesi but Jesus of Nazareth.

   (2.) Because they are not able to find out or fix on any one whatever
   to whom the things here spoken of may be accommodated. They speak,
   indeed, of Jeremiah, Josiah, a righteous man in general, the whole
   people of Israel, of Messiah Ben Joseph, a man of straw of their own
   setting up: but it is easy to manifest, were that our present work,
   that scarce any one expression in this prophecy, much less all, doth or
   can agree to any one or all of them named; so that it must be brought
   home to its proper subject. Of this at large in the ensuing digression
   against Grotius.

   2. That to us it is evident above all contradiction that the whole
   belongs to Jesus Christ; because not only particular testimonies are
   taken from hence in the New Testament, and applied to him, as Matt.
   viii. 17, Mark xv. 28, Luke xxii. 37, Rom. x. 16, but it is also
   expounded of him in general for the conversion of souls, Acts viii.
   26-40. The story is known of Philip and the eunuch.

   3. This is such a prophecy of Christ as belongs to him not only
   properly but immediately; that is, it doth not in the first place point
   out any type of Christ, and by him shadow out Christ, as it is in
   sundry psalms, where David and Solomon are firstly spoken of, though
   the Messiah be principally intended: but here is no such thing. Christ
   himself is immediately spoken of. Socinus says, indeed, that he doubted
   not but that these things did primarily belong to another, could he be
   discovered who he was, and that from him was the allusion taken, and
   the accommodation made to Christ; "And if," saith he, "it could be
   found out who he was, much light might be given into many expressions
   in the chapter." But this is a bold figment, for which there is not the
   least countenance given either from Scripture or reason, which is
   evidently decried from the former arguments, whereby the impudence of
   the Jews is confounded, and shall be farther in the ensuing digression,
   where it shall be proved that it is impossible to fix on any one but
   Jesus Christ to whom the several expressions and matters expressed in
   this prophecy may be accommodated.

   Now, there are three general parts of this prophecy, to consider it
   with reference to the business in hand, as the seat of this truth in
   the Old Testament:--

   1. A description given of Christ in a mean, low, miserable condition,
   from verse 14 of chap. lii. to verse 4 of chap. liii.: "His visage was
   marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men,"
   chap. lii. 14; "he hath no form nor comeliness, no beauty," chap. liii.
   2; "he is despised and rejected, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
   grief," verse 3; looked on as "stricken, smitten of God, and
   afflicted," verse 4.

   2. The reason is given of this representation of the Messiah, of whom
   it is said in the entrance of the prophecy that he should "deal
   prudently, and be exalted and extolled, and be very high;" to which
   this description of him seems most adverse and contrary. The reason, I
   say, hereof is given from verses 5 to 10; it was on the account of his
   being punished and broken for us and our sins.

   3. The issue of all this, from verse 10 to the end, in the
   justification and salvation of believers.

   It is the second that I shall insist upon, to prove the death of Christ
   to have in it the nature of punishment, properly and strictly so
   called.

   Not to insist upon all the particular passages, that might be done to
   great advantage, and ought to be done, did I purpose the thorough and
   full handling of the business before me (but I am "in transitu," and
   pressing to somewhat farther), I shall only urge two things:-- The
   expressions throughout that describe the state and condition of Christ
   as here proposed. Secondly, One or two singular assertions,
   comprehensive of much of the rest.

   For the first, let the reader consider what is contained in the several
   words here setting forth the condition of Christ. We have "despising
   and rejecting, sorrow and grief," verse 3. He was "stricken, smitten,
   afflicted," or there was striking, smiting, affliction on him, verse 4;
   "wounded, bruised, chastised with stripes," -- wounding, bruising,
   chastising unto soreness, verse 5; "oppressed, stricken, cut off,
   killed, brought to slaughter," verses 7-9; "bruised, sacrificed, and
   his soul made an offering for sin," verse 10.

   Now, certainly, for the material part, or the matter of punishment,
   here it is abundantly: here is "malum passionis" in every kind, --
   immission of evil, subtraction of good in soul and body; here is
   plentiful measure, heaped up, shaken together, and running over.

   But it may be said, though here be the matter of punishment, yet it may
   be all this was for some other end; and so it may be it was nouthesia,
   or dokimasia, or paideia, not timoria, or punishment properly so
   called.

   Consider, then, the ends of punishment before insisted on, and see what
   of them is applicable to the transaction between God and Christ here
   mentioned.

   1. Was it for his own correction? No; says the prophet, verse 9, "He
   had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth." He was
   perfectly innocent, so that he had no need of any chastisement for his
   amendment. And so signally in sundry places, where mention is made of
   the death of Christ, his own spotless innocency is often pleaded.

   2. Neither was it for his instruction, that he might be wise and
   instructed in the will of God; for at the very entrance of the
   prophecy, chap. lii. 13, he says he shall "deal prudently, and be
   exalted." He was faithful before in all things. And though he
   experimentally learned obedience by his sufferings, yet habitually to
   the utmost his ears were bored, and himself prepared to the will of
   God, before the afflictions here principally intended. Neither, --

   3. Was he paradeigma, punished for example, to be made an example to
   others that they might not offend; for what can offenders learn from
   the punishment of one who never offended? "He was cut off, but not for
   himself," Dan. ix. 26. And the end assigned, verse 11, which is not the
   instruction only, but the justification and salvation of others, will
   not allow this end: "He shall justify many, for he shall bear their
   iniquities." He set us an example in his obedience but he was not
   punished for an example. Neither, --

   4. Was it marturia, a suffering to bear witness and testimony to the
   truth. There is no mention of any such end in this place; yea, to make
   that the main intendment here is a monstrous figment. The expressions
   all along, as we shall see in the next place, are, that all this was
   "for our transgressions, for our sins, for our iniquities, for our
   peace." God wounded, bruised, killed him, for our iniquities; that is,
   he died to bear witness to his doctrine! "Credat Apella."

   Then, the matter of punishment being expressed, see the cause of the
   infliction of it. It was for "transgressions," for "iniquities," verse
   5; for wandering and "iniquity," verse 6; for "transgression," verse 8;
   for "sin," verse 12. Let us now remember the general description of
   punishment that was given at the beginning, -- it is "malum passionis
   quod infligitur ob malum actionis," -- and see how directly it suits
   with this punishment of Jesus Christ: first, Here is "malum passionis"
   inflicted, wounding, bruising, killing; and, secondly, There is "malum
   actionis" deserving, sin, iniquity, and transgression. How these met on
   an innocent person shall be afterward declared. Go we along to the
   peculiar description of punishment properly so called, as managed by
   God, -- it is "vindicta noxæ." Now, if all other ends and causes
   whatever, as of chastisement for example, etc., be removed, and this
   only be asserted, then this affliction of Christ was "vindicta noxæ,"
   punishment in the most proper sense; but that these ends are so removed
   hath been declared upon the particular consideration of them.

   And this is the first argument from this place to prove that the death
   of Christ and his suffering have the nature of punishment.

   The second is from the more particular expressions of it to this
   purpose, both on the part of the person punishing and on the part of
   the person punished. A single expression on each part may be insisted
   on:--

   1. On the part of God punishing, take that of verse 6, "The Lord hath
   laid on him the iniquity of us all;" of which sort also is that of
   verse 10, "Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to
   grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin," etc.

   2. On the part of him punished, verse 11, "He shall bear their
   iniquities.". From the consideration of these expressions we shall
   evidently evince what we have proposed. Of these in the next chapter.

Chapter XXIV.

   Some particular testimonies evincing the death of Christ to be a
   punishment, properly so called.

   The two expressions that I chose in particular to consider are nextly
   to be insisted on.

   The first relates to him who did inflict the punishment; the other to
   him that was punished. The first is in verse 6, "The Lord hath laid on
   him the iniquity of us all." The person punishing is Jehovah, the
   person punished called "him," -- that is, he who is spoken of
   throughout the whole prophecy, the Messiah, Jesus Christ, as above
   declared.

   For the opening of the words, that the efficacy of them to our purpose
   in hand may appear, two of them are especially to be considered: --
   First, What is meant by that which is rendered "laid on him;" secondly,
   What is meant by "iniquity."

   The first by our translation is rendered in the margin, "made to meet:"
   "He made to meet on him the iniquities of us all." The Vulgar Latin,
   "Posuit Dominus in eo," -- "The Lord put upon him," according to our
   translation in the text. Montanus, "Dominus fecit occurrere in eum," --
   "God hath caused to meet on him," according to our translation in the
   margin. Junius to the same purpose, "Jehovah fecit ut incurrat," --
   "The Lord made them meet and fall on him." The LXX. render it, Kai
   Kurios paredoken auton tais hamartiais hemon, -- "The Lord delivered
   him to our sins," that is, to be punished for them. By others the word
   is rendered "impegit, traduxit, conjecit," -- all to the same purpose,
   importing an act of God in conveying our sins to Christ.

   The word here used is hphgy? its root is pg?, to which all the
   significations mentioned are assigned, "occurrere, obviam ire,
   incurrere, aggredi, rogare, precari."

   1. The first general signification of it is "to meet," as the bounds of
   a field, or country, or house, meet with one another: Josh. xix. 34,
   vphg bzvvln?; so all along in that chapter, where the bounds of one
   country are said to reach to another, that is, to meet with them. It is
   the word here used. So in voluntary agents it is "obviam ire," or "to
   meet," and that either for good or evil. For good it is spoken of God,
   Isa. lxiv. 5, "Thou meetest him," etc; and so for evil, Amos v. 19, "As
   if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him," vphgv?, -- that is,
   to tear him in pieces. Hence, because men that met others went to them
   to desire some help of them, the word also signifies "to ask, to pray,
   entreat, or intercede:" so the word is used, Isa. lix. 16, "There was
   no entreater," mphgy?, -- none to meet, to come and ask; and in this
   very chapter, verse 12, "He made intercession for the transgressors."
   The word is the same with that here used. To meet the Lord, and
   intercede for transgressors, to stay his hand against them, is its
   sense.

   2. "To meet," or "to make to meet" properly, which is the first and
   most clear sense of the word. It is often used for to meet "animo
   hostili," to meet, to fall upon, for hurt. 1 Sam. xxii. 17, "The
   servants of the king would not put forth their hand lphg?, to meet,
   that is, as we have translated it, to "fall upon the priests" and kill
   them. So 2 Sam. i. 15, David bade his young man arise, pg?, "fall upon"
   the Amalekite, -- that is, to kill him. Samson made the men of Judah
   swear that they would not tpgvn?, "meet with him," or fall on him,
   themselves, Judges xv. 12.

   Nextly, it may be inquired in what sense the word is here used, whether
   in the first spoken of, "to ask, entreat, intercede;" or in the latter,
   "to meet," or "to meet with."

   Grotius interpreteth it (to remove so much of his interpretation by the
   way), "Permisit Deus, ut ille nostro gravi crimine indignissima
   pateretur," that so he might suit what is spoken to Jeremiah, without
   pretence or colour of proof. For the word, it is forty-six times used
   in the Old Testament, and if in any one of them it may be truly
   rendered "permisit," as it is done by him, or to that sense, let it be
   here so applied also. And for that sense (which is, that God suffered
   the Jews by their wickedness to entreat him evilly), it is most remote
   from the intendment of the words, and the Holy Ghost in them.

   First, then, that the words cannot be interpreted "to pray or
   intercede" is evident from the contexture, wherein it is said (in this
   sense), "He prayed him for the iniquity of us all;" that is, the Lord
   prayed Christ for the iniquities of us all. This sense of the word
   hphgy?, in this place, Socinus himself grants not to be proper nor
   consistent: "Porro significatio ilia, precari, in loco nostro locum
   habere non potest; alioqui sequeretur Esaiam voluisse dicere, Deum
   fecisse, ut omnium nostrum iniquitas per Christum, vel pro Christo
   precata fuerit, quod longe absurdissimum esse nemo non videt," Cap.
   xxi. p. 132, Prælec. Socin.

   It is, then, "to meet." Now, the word here used being in hiphil, which
   makes a double action of that expressed, by adding the cause by whose
   power, virtue, and impress the thing is done, thence it is here
   rendered "occurrere fecit," -- "he made to meet." And so the sense of
   it is, "God made our sins, as it were, to set upon or to fall upon
   Jesus Christ;" which is the most common use of the word, as hath been
   showed.

   It is objected that the word signifies to meet, yet no more but this
   may be the meaning of them, "God in Christ met with all our
   iniquities;" that is, for their pardoning, and removal, and taking
   away.

   Of the many things that may be given in for the eversion of this gloss
   I shall name only two, whereof the first is to the word, the latter to
   the matter. For the word, the conjugation, according to the common
   rule, enforces the sense formerly mentioned: he made to meet, and not
   he met. Secondly, The prophet in these words renders a reason of the
   contemptible, sad condition of the Messiah, at which so many were
   scandalized, and whereupon so few believed the report of the gospel
   concerning him; and this is, that God laid on him our iniquities. Now,
   there is no reason why he should be represented in so deplorable a
   state and condition if God only met with and prevented our sin in and
   by him; which he did (as they say) in his resurrection, wherein he was
   exceeding glorious. So that the meaning of the word is, that God made
   our sins to meet on him by laying them on him; and this sense Socinus
   himself consents unto, Prælec. cap. xxi. p. 133. But this also will
   farther appear in the explication of the next word, and that is "our
   iniquity."

   Secondly, "The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all," vn?. How
   the iniquity of us? That is, the punishment of our iniquity. I shall
   offer three things to make good this interpretation:--

   1. That the word is often found in that sense, so that it is no new or
   uncouth thing that here it should be so: Gen. iv. 13, vny?, "Mine
   iniquity is greater than I can bear;" it is the same word here used.
   They are the words of Cain, upon the denunciation of God's judgment on
   him; and what iniquity it is he gives you an account in the next words,
   "Behold, thou hast driven me out," verse 14. That was only the
   punishment laid on him. It is used in like manner several times, Lev.
   xx. 17, 19; 1 Sam. xxviii. 10, Saul sware to the witch that no iniquity
   should befall her, -- that is, no punishment for that which she did at
   his command, in raising up a spirit to consult withal, contrary to the
   law; and also in sundry other places: so that this is no new
   signification of the word, and is here most proper.

   2. It appears from the explication that is given of this thing in many
   other expressions in the chapter: "The Lord hath laid on him the
   iniquity of us all." How? In that "it pleased him to bruise him, and
   put him to grief," verse 10; in that he "was wounded for our
   transgressions, and he was bruised for our iniquities," verse 5; as
   will be made more evident when I come to the next phrase, "He shall
   bear their iniquities," which answers to this, "He laid them on him."

   3. Because he did so lay our sin on Christ that "he made his soul an
   offering for sin." When our iniquities were on him, "his soul" (that
   is, he himself, by a usual synecdoche, the soul for the person) "was
   made 'sm?, an offering for sin." The word here used is like "piaculum"
   in Latin; which signifies the fault, and him who is punished for it in
   a way of a public sacrifice. So is this word taken both for a sin, a
   trespass, and a sacrifice for the expiation of it, as another word,
   namely, cht'?, is used also, Lev. iv. 3, "He shall offer it lcht't?,
   for a sin," -- that is, an offering for sin. So also Exod. xxix. 14,
   Lev. iv. 29. And this very word is so used, Lev. vii. 2, "They shall
   kill 'sm?;" that is, the sin, or sin-offering, or "trespass-offering,"
   as there it is rendered. And other instances might be given, Now, God
   did so cause our iniquities to meet on Christ that he then under them
   made himself 'sm?, or "an offering for sin." Now, in the offering for
   sin the penalty of the offence was, "suo more," laid on the beast that
   was sacrificed or made an offering. Paul interpreteth these words by
   other expressions: 2 Cor. v. 21, "He made him to be a sin for us;" that
   is, an offering for sin, 'sm?. He made him sin when he made him "a
   curse, the curse of the law," Gal. iii. 13; that is, gave him up to the
   punishment by the law due to sin. Rom. viii. 3, "God sending his own
   Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin," kai peri hamartias,
   for sin, a sacrifice for sin, "condemned sin in the flesh." Heb. x. 6,
   Holokautomata kai peri hamartias ouk eudokesas, "In burnt-offerings and
   for sin thou hast had no pleasure;" and again, Hoti thusian kai
   prosphoran kai holokautomata kai peri hamartias verse 8.

   It appears, then, from all that hath been said, that our iniquities
   that were laid on Christ were the punishment due to our iniquity.

   Farther to clear this, I shall a little consider what act of God this
   was whereby he laid our iniquities on Christ; and these two things are
   considerable therein: 1. How it was typically prefigured; 2. How it was
   done, or in what act of God the doing of it doth consist.

   1. This was eminently represented in the great anniversary sacrifice,
   of which I have spoken formerly, especially in that part which concerns
   the goat, apopompaios, on which the lot fell to be sent away. That that
   goat was a sacrifice is evident from Lev. xvi. 5, where both the kids
   of the goats (afterward said to be two goats) are said to be "a
   sin-offering." How this was dealt withal, see verse 21: "Aaron shall
   lay both his hands upon the live goat, and confess over him all the
   iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in
   all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat." Now, in what
   sense could the sins of the people be put upon the head of the goat?

   (1.) This was not merely a representation, as it were a show or
   pageant, to set forth the taking away of iniquity, but sins were
   really, as to that typical institution, laid on the head of the goat;
   whence he became a "piaculum," an anathema, and he that touched him was
   defiled: so verse 26, the man that carried out the goat was unclean
   until he was legally purified; and that because the sin of the people
   was on the head of the goat which he so carried away.

   (2.) The proper pravity, malice, and filth of sin could not be laid on
   the goat. Neither the nature of the thing nor the subject will bear it:
   for neither is tin, which is a privation, an irregularity, an
   obliquity, such a thing as that it can be translated from one to
   another, although it hath an infectious and a contagious quality to
   diffuse itself, -- that is, to beget something of the like nature in
   others; nor was the goat a subject wherein any such pernicious or
   depraved habit might reside, which belongs only to intelligent
   creatures, which have a moral rule to walk by.

   (3.) It must be the punishment of sin that is here intended, which was,
   in the type, laid on the head of the goat; and therefore it was sent
   away into a land not inhabited, a land of separation, a wilderness,
   there to perish, as all the Jewish doctors agree, -- that is, to
   undergo the punishment that was inflicted on it. That in such
   sacrifices for sin there was a real imputation of sin unto punishment
   shall afterward be farther cleared.

   Unto this transaction doth the prophet allude in this expression, "He
   laid on," or "put on him." As the high priest confessed all the sins,
   iniquities, and transgressions of the people, and laid them on the head
   of the scapegoat, which he bare, undergoing the utmost punishment he
   was capable of, and that punishment which, in the general kind and
   nature, is the punishment due to sin, -- an evil and violent death; so
   did God lay all the sins, all the punishment due to them, really upon
   one that was fit, able, and appointed to bear it, which he suffered
   under to the utmost that the justice of God required on that account.
   He then took a view of all our sins and iniquities. He knew what was
   past and what was to come, knowing all our thoughts afar off. Not the
   least error of our minds, darkness of our understandings, perverseness
   of our wills, carnality of our affections, sin of our nature or lives,
   escaped him. All were gumna kai tetrachelismena before him. This is set
   out by the variety of expressions used in this matter in the type: "All
   the iniquities, all the transgressions, and all the sins." And so by
   every word whereby we express sin in this 53d of Isaiah, -- "going
   astray, turning aside, iniquity, transgression, sin," and the like.
   God, I say, made them all to meet on Christ., in the punishment due to
   them.

   2. What is the act of God whereby he casts our sins on Christ.

   I have elsewhere considered how God in this business is to be looked
   on. [480] I said now in the entrance of this discourse, that punishment
   is an effect of justice in him who had power to dispose of the offender
   as such. To this two things are required:--

   (1.) That he have in his hand power to dispose of all the concernments
   of the offence [offender] and sinners, as the governor of him and them
   all. This is in God. He is by nature the king and governor of all the
   world, our lawgiver, James iv. 12. Having made rational creatures and
   required obedience at their hands, it is essentially belonging to him
   to be their governor, [481] and not only to have the sovereign disposal
   of them, as he hath the supreme dominion over them, with the legal
   dispose of them, in answer to the moral subjection to him and the
   obedience he requires of them.

   (2.) That as he be a king, and have supreme government, so he be a
   judge to put in execution his justice. Thus, "God is judge himself,"
   Ps. l. 6; he is "the judge of all the earth," Gen. xviii. 25; Ps. xciv.
   2; Ps. lxxv. 7; Isa. xxxiii. 22, as in innumerable other places. Now,
   as God is thus the great governor and judge, he pursues the
   constitutive principle of punishment, his own righteous and holy will,
   proportioning penalties to the demerit of sin.

   Thus, in the laying our sins on Christ, there was a twofold act of God,
   -- one as a governor, the other as a judge properly:--

   [1.] The first is "innovatio obligationis," the "innovation of the
   obligation," wherein we were detained and bound over to punishment;
   whereas in the tenor of the law, as to its obligation unto punishment,
   there was none originally but the name of the offender, -- "In the day
   that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die," and "Cursed is every
   one that continueth not," and "The soul that sinneth it shall die," --
   God now puts in the name of the surety, of Jesus Christ, that he might
   become responsible for our sins, and undergo the punishment that we
   were obliged to. Christ was hupo nomon genomenon, he was made under the
   law; that is, he was put into subjection to the obligation of it unto
   punishment. God put his name into the obligation, and so the law came
   to have its advantage against him, who otherwise was most free from the
   charge of it. Then was Christ "made sin," when, by being put into the
   obligation of the law, he became liable to the punishment of it. He was
   the "mediator of the new covenant," Heb. xii. 24, the "mediator between
   God and men," 1 Tim. ii. 5; so a mediator as to "give himself a ransom"
   for them for whom he was a mediator, verse 6. And the "surety of the
   covenant" is he also, Heb. vii. 22; such a surety as paid that which he
   never took, made satisfaction for those sins which he never did.

   [2.] The second act of God, as a judge, is "inflictio poenæ." Christ
   being now made obnoxious, and that by his own consent, the justice of
   God finding him in the law, layeth the weight of all on him. "He had
   done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth." Well, then, it
   will be well with him; surely it shall be well with the innocent; no
   evil shall befall him. Nay but saith he, verse 10, "Yet it pleased the
   Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief." Yea, but what was the
   reason of this? why was this the will of God? why did this seem good to
   the just "Judge of all the earth?" The reason is in the very next
   words, "His soul was made an offering for sin;" which before is
   expressed, "He bare our griefs, he was wounded for our transgressions."
   Being made liable to them, he was punished for them.

   By that which is said, it is evident from this first expression, or the
   assignation of an action to God in reference to him, that this death of
   Christ was a punishment, he who had power to do it bringing in him (on
   his own voluntary offer) into the obligation to punishment, and
   inflicting punishment on him accordingly.

   The second expression, whereby the same thing is farther evinced, is on
   the part of him that was punished, and this [occurs] in verse 4,
   "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows;" or, which
   is more evident, verse 11, "He shall bear their iniquities."

   For the right understanding of the words, I shall give a few brief
   previous observations, that may give light to the matter we treat of.
   And the first is, --

   1. That as this whole thing was done in the justice of God, as hath
   been declared, so it was done by the counsel and appointment of God.
   The apostles confess the death of Christ to have proceeded thence, Acts
   iv. 28, ii. 23. Now, as laying of our sins on Christ, being designed
   our mediator, and undertaking the work, was an act of God as the
   governor of all and the righteous judge, so this of the determinate
   counsel and fore-appointment, or the eternal designation, of Christ to
   his office, is an act of sovereign power and dominion in God, whereby
   he doth as he pleaseth, according to the counsel of his will. As he
   would make the world in his sovereign good pleasure when he might have
   otherwise done, Rev. iv. 11, so he would determine that Christ should
   bear our iniquities when he might otherwise have disposed of them, Rom.
   xi. 33-36.

   2. In respect of us, this pre-appointment of God was an act of grace,
   -- that is, a sovereign act of his good pleasure, -- whence all good
   things, all fruits of love whatever, to us do flow. Therefore it is
   called love, John iii. 16; and so in the fruit of it is it expressed,
   Rom. viii. 32; and on this John often insists in his Gospel and First
   Epistle, 1 John iv. 9-11. His aim on his own part was the declaration
   of his righteousness, Rom. iii. 25, and to make way for the "praise of
   his glorious grace," Eph. i. 6; on our part, that we might have all
   those good things which are the fruits of the most intense love.

   3. That Christ himself was willing to undergo this burden and undertake
   this work. And this, as it is consistent with his death being a
   punishment, so it is of necessity to make good the other considerations
   of it, namely, that it should be a price and a sacrifice; for no man
   gives a price, and therein parts with that which is precious to him,
   unwillingly, nor is a sacrifice acceptable that comes not from a free
   and willing mind. That he was thus willing himself professeth, both in
   the undertaking and carrying of it on. In the undertaking: Heb. x. 7,
   "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God." It is the expression of one
   breaking out with a ready joy to do the thing proposed to him. So the
   church of old looked on him as one that came freely and cheerfully:
   Cant. ii. 8, 9, "The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping
   upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. My beloved is like a roe
   or a young hart: he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the
   windows, showing himself through the lattice." The church looked on
   Christ as yet at a distance from the actual performance of the work he
   had undertaken, and so herself kept off from that clear and close
   communion which she longed after; and hence she says of him that he
   "stood behind the wall," that he "looked forth at the windows," and
   "showed himself through the lattice." There was a wall yet hindering
   the actual exhibition of Christ; the "fulness of time" was not come;
   the purpose of God was not yet to bring forth: but yet, in the
   meantime, Christ looked on the church through the window of the promise
   and the lattice of the Levitical ceremonies.

   And what discovery do they make of him in the view they take in the
   broad light of the promises and the many glimpses of the ceremonial
   types? They see him "coming leaping upon the mountains and skipping
   upon the hills," -- coming speedily, with a great deal of joy and
   willingness.

   So of himself he declares what his mind was from old, from everlasting:
   Prov. viii. 30, 31, "Rejoicing always before him," -- that is, before
   God his Father. But in what did he rejoice? "In the habitable part of
   his earth; and his delights were with the sons of men." When this joy
   of his was he tells you, verses 22-30. He rejoiced before God his
   Father in the sons of men before they were created; that is, in the
   work he had to do for them.

   His will was also in the carrying of it on unto accomplishment; he must
   be doing his Father's business, his will who sent him: Luke xii. 50,
   Pos sunechomai! He was pained as a woman in travail to be delivered, to
   come to be baptized in his own blood. And when he was giving himself up
   to the utmost of it, he professes his readiness to it, John xviii. 11;
   when Peter, who once before would have advised him to spare himself,
   now, seeing his counsel was not followed, would have rescued him with
   his sword. As for his advice he was called Satan, so for his proffered
   assistance he is now rebuked; and the reason of it is given, "Shall I
   not drink of the cup?" It is true, that it might appear that his death
   was not a price and a sacrifice only, but a punishment also, wherein
   there was an immission of every thing that was evil to the suffering
   nature and a subtraction of that which was good, he discovered that
   averseness to the drinking of the cup which the truth of the human
   nature absolutely required (and which the amazing bitterness of the cup
   overpowered him withal); yet still his will conquered and prevailed in
   all, Matt. xxvi. 53, 54.

   4. Christ's love was also in it; "his delights were with the sons of
   men," his love towards them carried him out to the work. And Paul
   proves it by the instance of himself, Gal. ii. 20, "Who loved me;" and
   John applies the same to all believers, Rev. i. 5, 6, "Unto him that
   loved us," etc. And thus was this great work undertaken.

   These things being premised, let us look again to the words under
   consideration:--

   1. For the word he bare our griefs, verse 4, it is ns'?, a word of as
   large and as many various acceptations as any, if not absolutely the
   most extensive in the whole Hebrew tongue. It hath usually assigned
   unto it by the lexicographer eight or nine several significations; and
   to make it evident that it is of various acceptations, it is used (in
   the collections of Calasius) eight hundred and eighteen times in the
   Old Testament, whereof not a third part is answered in any language by
   one and the same word. With those senses of it that are metaphorical we
   have not any thing to do. That which is the first or most proper sense
   of it, and what is most frequently used, is to "carry" or "bear," and
   by which it is here translated, as in very many other places.

   Socinus would have it here be as much as "abstulit," "he took away." So
   saith he. "God took away our sin in Christ, when by him he declared and
   confirmed the way whereby pardon and remission is to be obtained, as he
   pardoned our sin in Christ by discovering the new covenant and mercy
   therein." Now, because the word is of such various significations,
   there is a necessity that it be interpreted by the circumstances of the
   place where it is used. And because there is not any circumstance of
   the place on the account whereof the word should be rendered
   "abstulit," "he took away," and not "tulit," "he took," "bare," or
   "suffered," we must consider what arguments or reasons are scraped
   together "aliunde" by them, and then evince what is the proper
   signification of it in this place:--

   (1.) "This very expression is used of God, Exod. xxxiv. 7, ns' vn?,
   ferens iniquitatem,' as also it is again repeated, Num. xiv. 18; in
   both which places we translate it forgiving,' forgiving iniquity and
   transgression and sin.' Nor can it be properly spoken of God to bear,
   for God cannot bear, as the word properly signifies."

   The sum of the objection is, the word that is used so many times, and
   so often metaphorically, is once or twice in another place used for to
   take away or to pardon, therefore this must be the sense of it in this
   place! God cannot be said to bear iniquities but only metaphorically,
   and so he is often said to bear, to be pressed, to be weary, and made
   to serve with them. He is said to bear our sins in reference to the end
   of bearing any thing, which is to carry it away. God in Christ taking
   away, pardoning our sins, is said to bear them, because that is the way
   which sins are taken away; they are taken up, carried, and laid aside.
   But he of whom these words are spoken here did bear properly, and could
   do so, as shall be showed.

   (2.) The interpretation of this place by Matthew, or the application of
   it, is insisted on, which is of more importance: "Matt. viii. 16, 17,
   Christ curing the diseases of many, and bodily sicknesses, is said to
   bear our griefs,' according as it is said in Isaiah that he should do.
   Now, he did not bear our diseases by taking them upon himself, and so
   becoming diseased, but morally, in that by his power he took them away
   from them in whom they were."

   Not to make many words, nor to multiply interpretations and
   accommodations of these places, -- which may be seen in them who have
   to good purpose made it their business to consider the parallel places
   of the Old and New Testaments, and to reconcile them, -- I say only, it
   is no new thing to have the effect and evidence and end of a thing
   spoken of in the New Testament, in answer to the cause and rise of it
   mentioned in the Old, by the application of the same words unto it
   which they are mentioned in. For instance, Paul, Eph. iv. 8, citing
   that of the psalmist, Ps. lxviii. 18, "Thou hast ascended up on high,
   and hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for men," renders
   it, "When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave
   gifts unto men;" and that because his giving of them was the end of his
   receiving of them, and his receiving of them the foundation of his
   giving of them, the effect and fruit being here expressed, the
   foundation and ground supposed. So also, "Mine ears hast thou bored,"
   Ps. xl. 6, is rendered "A body hast thou prepared me," Heb. x. 5;
   because the end of the boring of the ears of Christ was, that he might
   offer his body a sacrifice to God. So it is here in this place of
   Matthew. Christ's taking away the bodily distempers and sicknesses of
   men was an effect and an evidence of his taking away their sins, which
   was done by bearing of them; and therefore Matthew mentioning the
   effect and evidence of the thing doth it in the words that express the
   cause and foundation of it. Not that that was a complete accomplishment
   of what was foretold, but that it was so demonstrated in the effect and
   evidence of it. Nor do the Socinians themselves think that this was a
   full accomplishment of what is spoken by the prophet, themselves
   insisting on another interpretation of the words. So that
   notwithstanding these exceptions, the word here may have its proper
   signification, of bearing or carrying; which also that it hath may be
   farther evidenced.

   (1.) Here is no cogent reason why the metaphorical use of the word
   should be understood. When it is spoken of God, there is necessity that
   it should be interpreted by the effect, because properly he cannot bear
   nor undergo grief, sorrow, or punishment: but as to the Mediator, the
   case is otherwise, for he confessedly underwent these things properly,
   wherein we say that this word "bearing of punishment" doth consist; he
   was so bruised, so broken, so slain. So that there is no reason to
   depart from the propriety of the word.

   (2.) Those who would have the sense of the word to be, "to take away,"
   in this place, confess it is by way of the allusion before mentioned,
   that he that takes away a thing takes it up, and bears it on his
   shoulders, or in his arms, until he lay it down, and by virtue of this
   allusion doth it signify "to take away." But why? Seeing that taking up
   and bearing in this place is proper, as hath been showed, why must that
   be leaped over, and that which is improper and spoken by way of
   allusion be insisted on?

   (3.) It appears that this is the sense of the word from all the
   circumstances of the text and context. Take three that are most
   considerable:--

   [1.] The subject spoken of who did thus bear our griefs, and this is
   Christ, of whom such things are affirmed, in answer to this question,
   How did he bear our griefs? as will admit of no other sense. The Holy
   Ghost tells us how he did it, 1 Pet. ii. 24, "Who his own self bare our
   sins in his own body on the tree." That Peter in that place expressed
   this part of the prophecy of Isaiah which we insist upon is evident;
   the phrase at the close of verse 24 and the beginning of verse 25 of
   this chapter make it so; they are the very words of the end of the 5th
   and beginning of the 6th verses here. How, then, did Christ bear our
   griefs? Why, in that "he bare our sins in his own body on the tree."

   I shall not insist on the precise signification of the word anaphero,
   here used, as though it expressed the outward manner of that suffering
   of Christ for sin when he was lifted up on the cross or tree. It is
   enough that our sins were on him, his body, -- that is, his whole human
   nature, by a usual synecdoche, -- when he was on the tree; that he did
   it when he "suffered in the flesh," 1 Pet. iv. 1. He that did so bear
   our griefs, sins, and iniquities, as to have them in his own body when
   he suffered in the flesh, he is said properly therein "tulisse," not
   "abstulisse," to "have borne," not "taken away," our griefs. But that
   this is the case in Christ's bearing our griefs the Holy Ghost doth
   thus manifest.

   [2.] The manner how Christ bare them evidently manifesteth in what
   sense this expression is to be understood. He so bare them that in
   doing so "he was wounded and bruised, grieved, chastised, slain," as it
   is at large expressed in the context. Christ bare our griefs so as in
   doing of it to be wounded, broken, grieved, killed; which is not to
   take them away, but really to bear them upon himself.

   [3.] The cause of this bearing our griefs is assigned to be sin, "He
   was wounded for our transgressions;" as was shown before. Now, this
   cannot be the sense, "For our sins, he took them away;" but, "For our
   sins, he bare the punishment due to them," 2 Cor. v. 21.

   (4.) To put all out of question, the Holy Ghost in this chapter useth
   another word in the same matter with this, that will admit of no other
   sense than that which is proper, and that is svl? Verse 11, vvntm hv'
   ysbl?, -- "He shall bear their iniquities;" and it is used immediately
   after this we have insisted on, as explicative of it, "And carried our
   sorrows." Now, as ns'? properly signifies "to lift," to "take up" that
   which a man may carry, so svl? signifies to "bear" and "undergo" the
   burden that is taken up, or that a man hath laid on his shoulders. And
   Matthew hath rendered this word by bastazo tas nosous ebastasen, --
   that is, "bajulo, porto," to bear a thing as a man doth a burden on his
   shoulders. Nor is it once used in the Scriptures but it is either
   properly to bear a burden, or metaphorically from thence to undergo
   that which is heavy and burdensome. Thus did Christ bear our griefs,
   our iniquities, by putting his shoulder under them, taking them on
   himself.

   2. What did he thus bear? Our griefs, our sins; or our iniquities, our
   sins. Let us see, by a second instance, what it is in the language of
   God "to bear iniquities," and this argument will be at an issue: Lam.
   v. 7, "Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
   iniquities." "We have borne their iniquities," or the punishment that
   was due to them. "They are not," -- "They are gone out of the world
   before the day of recompense came; and we lie under the punishment
   threatened and inflicted for their sins and our own." Distinctly, --

   (1.) Men are said to bear their own sin: Lev. xix. 8, "Every one that
   eateth it shall bear his iniquity;" that is, he shall be esteemed
   guilty, and be punished. Lev. xx. 17, "He shall bear his iniquity," is
   the same with "He shall be killed," verse 16, and "He shall be cut off
   from among his people," verse 18. For a man to "bear his iniquity," is,
   constantly, for him to answer for the guilt and undergo the punishment
   due to it.

   (2.) So also of the sins of others: Num. xiv. 33, "And your children
   shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms."
   "Bear your whoredoms;" that is, "My anger for them, and the punishment
   due to them." Num. xxx. 15, he that compels by his power and authority
   another to break a vow shall himself be liable to the punishment due to
   such a breach of vow. Ezek. xviii. 20 is an explanation of all these
   places: "The soul that sinneth, it shall die," -- "it shall be
   punished." "The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father," etc.,
   -- "The son shall not be punished for the sin of the father, nor the
   father for the sin of the son." In brief, this expression, "to bear
   iniquities," is never otherwise used in Scripture but only for "to
   undergo the punishment due thereunto."

   Thus much, then, we have clearly evinced: God did so lay our sins on
   Christ as that he bare and underwent that which was due to them, God
   inflicting it on him, and he willingly undergoing it; which is my
   second demonstration from this place, that the death of Christ is also
   a punishment; which is all that I shall urge to that purpose. And this
   is that, and all, that we intend by the satisfaction of Christ.

   But now, having laid so great stress, as to the doctrine under
   demonstration, upon this place of the prophet, and finding some
   attempting to take away our foundation, before I proceed I shall divert
   to the consideration of the annotations of Grotius on this whole
   chapter, and rescue it from his force and violence, used in contending
   to make what is here spoken to suit the prophet Jeremiah, and to intend
   him in the first place; to establish which vain conjecture, he hath
   perverted the sense of the whole and of every particular verse, from
   the beginning to the end of this prophecy.

Chapter XXV.

   A digression concerning the 53d chapter of Isaiah, and the vindication
   of it from the perverse interpretation of Hugo Grotius.

   This chapter is well by some termed "Carnificina Rabbinorum," -- a
   place of Scripture that sets them on the rack, and makes them turn
   themselves all ways possible to escape the torture which it puts their
   unbelieving hearts unto. Not long since a worthy and very learned
   friend told me, that speaking with Manasseh Ben Israel at Amsterdam,
   and urging this prophecy unto him, he ingenuously told him, "Profecto
   locus iste magnum scandalum dedit;" to whom the other replied, "Recte,
   quia Christus vobis lapis scandali est." Hulsius, the Hebrew professor
   at Breda, professes that some Jews told him that their rabbins could
   easily have extricated themselves from all other places of the
   prophets, if Isaiah in this place had but held his peace, Huls.
   Theolog. Judaic. lib. i. part. ii. Dict. Sapp. de Tempor. Messiæ. [482]
   Though I value not their boasting of their extricating themselves from
   the other prophecies, knowing that they are no less entangled with that
   of Dan. ix. (of which there is an eminent story in Franzius de
   Sacrificiis concerning his dispute with a learned Jew on that subject
   [483] ), yet it appears that by this they are confessedly intricated
   beyond all hope of evading, until they divest themselves of their
   cursed hypothesis.

   Hence it is that with so much greediness they scraped together all the
   copies of Abrabanel's comment on this chapter, so that it was very hard
   for a Christian a long time to get a sight of it, as Constantine
   l'Empereur acquaints us in his preface to his refutation of it, [484]
   because they thought themselves in some measure instructed by him to
   avoid the arguments of the Christians from hence by his application of
   the whole to Josiah; and I must needs say he hath put as good, yea, a
   far better colour of probability upon his interpretation than he with
   whom I have to do hath done on his.

   How ungrateful, then, and how unacceptable to all professors of the
   name of Jesus Christ, must the labours of Grotius needs be, who hath to
   the utmost of his power reached out his hand to relieve the poor blind
   creatures from their rack and torture, by applying, though
   successlessly, this whole prophecy to Jeremiah, casting himself into
   the same entanglements with them, not yielding them indeed the least
   relief, is easy to conjecture. And this is not a little aggravated, in
   that the Socinians, who are no less racked and tortured with this
   scripture than the Jews, durst never yet attempt to accommodate the
   things here spoken of to any other, though they have expressed a desire
   of so doing, and which if they could compass, they would free
   themselves from the sharpest sword that lies at the throat of their
   cause, seeing if it is certain that the things here mentioned may be
   applied to any other, the satisfaction of Christ cannot from them be
   confirmed. This digression, then, is to cast into the fire that broken
   crutch which this learned man hath lent unto the Jews and Socinians to
   lean upon, and keep themselves from sinking under their unbelief.

   To discover the rise of that learned man's opinion, that Jeremiah is
   intended in this prophecy, the conceits of the Jewish doctors may a
   little be considered, who are divided amongst themselves.

   1. The ancient doctors generally conclude that it is the Messiah who is
   here intended. "Behold, my servant the Messiah shall prosper," says the
   Chaldee paraphrast upon the place. And Constantine l'Empereur tells
   [us] from R. Simeon, in his book Salkout, that the ancient rabbins, in
   their ancient book Tanchuma, and higher, were of the same judgment.
   [485] Rabbi Moses Alscheth is urged to the same purpose at large by
   Hulsius; and in his comment on this place he says expressly, "Ecce
   doctores nostri laudatæ memoriæ uno ore statuunt, et a majoribus
   acceperunt, de rege Messia sermonem esse, et doctorum L. M. vestigiis
   insistemus." And one passage in him is very admirable, in the same
   place; saith he, "Dicunt doctores nostri L. M. omnium affiictionum quæ
   mundum ingressæ sunt, tertia pars Davidi et patriarchis obtigit, tertia
   altera seculo excisionis, ultima tertia pars regi Messiæ incumbet;"
   where he urgeth the common consent of their doctors for the sufferings
   of the Messiah. Of the same mind was R. Solomon, as he is cited by
   Petrus Galatinus, lib. viii. cap. xiv.; as the same is affirmed by the
   Misdrach Resh, cap. ii. 14; and in Bereshith Rabba on Gen. xxiv. as is
   observed by Raymundus Martinus, Pug. Fidei 3, p. dist. 1, cap. x. So
   that before these men grew impudent and crafty in corrupting and
   perverting the testimonies of the Old Testament concerning the Messiah,
   they generally granted him and only him to be here intended. It was not
   for want of company, then, that Grotius took in with the modern
   rabbins, who, being mad with envy and malice, care not what they say,
   so they may oppose Jesus Christ.

   2. Many of the following Jewish doctors interpret this place of the
   whole people of the Jews. And this way go the men who are of the
   greatest note amongst them in these latter days, as R. D. Kimchi, Aben
   Ezra, Abrabanel, Lipman, with what weak and mean pretences, with what
   inconsistency as to the words of the text, hath been by others
   manifested.

   3. Abrabinel, or Abrabanel, a man of great note and honour amongst
   them, though he assents to the former exposition, of applying the whole
   prophecy to the people of the Jews, and interprets the words at large
   accordingly, -- which exposition is confuted by Constantine l'Empereur,
   -- yet he inclines to a singular opinion of his own, that Josiah is the
   man pointed at and described; but he is the first and last that abides
   by that interpretation.

   4. Grotius interprets the words of Jeremiah in the first place, not
   denying them, as we shall see, to have an accommodation to Christ. In
   this he hath the company of one rabbi, R. Saadias Gaon, mentioned by
   Aben Ezra upon the 52d chapter of this prophecy, verse 13. But this
   fancy of Saadias is fully confuted by Abrabanel; whose words, because
   they sufficiently evert the whole design of Grotius also, I shall
   transcribe as they lie in the translation of Hulsius: "Revera ne unum
   quidem versiculum video, qui de Jeremiah exponi posit: qua ratione de
   eo dicetur, Extolletur et altus erit valde?' Item illud, propter eum
   obdent reges os suum,' am ætas ilia prophetas habere consueverat.
   Quomodo etiam dici potest morbos nostros portasse, et dolores nostros
   bajulasse, et in tumice ejus curationem nobis esse, Deum in ipsum
   incurrere fecisse peccata omnium nostrum: quasi ipsi poena incubuisset,
   et Israel fuisset immunis? Jam illud, Propter peccatum populi mei plaga
   ipsis,' item, Dedit cum improbis sepulcrum ejus,' ad ipsum referri
   nequit; multo minus illud, Videbit semen, prolongabit dies,' item, cum
   robustis partietur spolium.' In quibus omnibus nihil est quod de ipso
   commode affirmari possit. Unde vehementer miror, quomodo R. Hagaon in
   hanc sententiam perduci potuerit, et sapientes dari qui hanc
   expositionem laudant; cum tamen tota ista exponendi ratio plane aliena
   sit, et e Scriptura non facta."

   Now, certainly, if this Jew thought he had sufficient cause to admire
   that the blind rabbi should thus wrest the sense of the Holy Ghost, and
   that any wise man should be so foolish as to commend it, we cannot but
   be excused in admiring that any man professing himself a Christian
   should insist in his steps, and that any should commend him for so
   doing.

   That, therefore, which here is affirmed in the entrance of his
   discourse by Abrabanel, namely, that not one verse can or may be
   expounded of Jeremiah, shall now particularly be made good against
   Grotius:--

   He confesseth with us that the head of this prophecy and discourse is
   in verse 13, chap. lii. The words of that verse are, --

   "Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and
   extolled, and be very high."

   Of the sense of which words, thus he:--

   "Ecce intelliget servus meus. Hæc omnia clarissime sibi revelata
   cognoscet Jeremias. Exaltabitur et elevabitur, et sublimis erit valde.
   In magno honore erit apud ipsos Chaldæos, Jer. xxxix., in fine, et
   xl.;" -- "My servant Jeremiah shall have all these things clearly
   revealed to him, and he shall be in great honour with the Chaldeans."
   So he.

   1. For the words themselves: yskyl?, with the Vulgar Latin, he renders
   "intelliget," "shall understand." The word signifies rather "prudence"
   for action with success, than any speculative knowledge by revelation.
   1 Sam. xviii. 30, it is used of David behaving himself wisely in the
   business of his military and civil employment. Its opposite, saith
   Pagnine, is tvl?, "quod incogitantiam significat in rebus agendis et
   ignavam levitatem," -- "which signifies incogitancy in the management
   of affairs and idle lightness." Whence the word is usually taken for to
   "prosper" in affairs; as it is used of our Saviour, Jer. xxiii. 5, "A
   King shall reign" vhskyl?, "and prosper." Nor can it be otherwise used
   here, considering the connection of the words wherein it stands, it
   being the precedent to his being "highly exalted" who is spoken of;
   which rather follows his "dealing prudently" than his "receiving
   revelations." So that in the very entrance there is a mistake in the
   sense of the word, and that mistake lies at the bottom of the whole
   interpretation.

   2. I deny that God speaks anywhere in the Scripture of any one besides
   Jesus Christ in this phrase, without any addition, "My servant," as
   here, "Behold, my servant." So he speaks of Christ, Isa. xlii. 1, 19,
   and other places; but not of any other person whatever. It is an
   expression kat exochen, and not to be applied to any but to him who was
   the great servant of the Father in the work of mediation.

   3. Even in respect of revelations, there is no ground why those made to
   Jeremiah should be spoken of so emphatically, and by way of eminence
   above others, seeing he came short of the prophet by whom these words
   are written. Nor can any instance be given of such a prediction used
   concerning any prophet whatever that was to be raised up in the church
   of the Jews, but of Christ himself only.

   4. The exposition of the close of these words, "He shall be exalted and
   extolled, and be very high" [486] (the great exaltation of the Lord
   Jesus Christ in his kingdom, when he was made a prince and saviour in a
   most eminent manner, being set forth in various expressions, no one
   reaching to the glory of it), is unworthy the learned annotator. "He
   shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high;" -- that is, the
   Chaldeans shall give him "victuals and a reward," Jer. xl. 5; and after
   a while he shall be carried a prisoner into Egypt, and there knocked on
   the head. Such was the exaltation of the poor prophet! What resemblance
   hath all this to the exaltation of Jesus Christ, whom the learned man
   confesseth to be intended in these words?

   The sense, then, of these words is: Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the
   servant of the Father, Isa. xlii. 1, 19, Phil. ii. 7, 8, "shall deal
   prudently," and prosper in the business of doing his Father's will, and
   carrying on the affairs of his own kingdom, Isa. ix. 7, "and be
   exalted" far above all principalities and powers, having "a name given
   him above every name, that at the name of Jesus," etc., Phil. ii. 9,
   10.

   The next verse is, --

   "As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than
   any man, and his form more than the sons of men."

   Of the accomplishment of this in and upon the Lord Jesus Christ there
   is no difficulty. The astonishment mentioned is that of men at his low
   and despicable condition as to outward appearance; which was such as
   that he said of himself "he was a worm, and no man," Ps. xxii. 6. His
   condition was such and his visage such as all that knew any thing of
   him were astonished to the purpose. The marring of his visage and form,
   as it may point out all the acts of violence that were done upon his
   face, by spitting, buffeting, and the like, so it expresses his whole
   despised, contemned, persecuted estate and condition. But let us attend
   to our annotator:--

   "Modò secunda, modò tertiâ personâ, de Jeremia loquitur, quod frequens
   Hebræis. Sicut multi mirati erant hominem tam egregium tam foedè
   tractari, detrudi in carcerem, deinde in lacum lutosum, ibique et
   pædore et cibi inopiâ contabescere; sic contra, rebus mutatis,
   admirationi erit honos ipsi habitus;" -- "He speaks of Jeremiah,
   sometimes in the second, sometimes in the third person; which is
   frequent with the Hebrews. As many wondered that so excellent a person
   should so vilely be dealt with, be thrust into prison, and then into a
   miry lake, and there to pine with stink and want of food; so on the
   contrary, affairs being changed, the honour afforded him shall be
   matter of admiration."

   1. To grant the first observation, as to the change of persons in the
   discourse, the word (smmv?, "shall be astonished") here used signifies
   not every slight admiration, by wondering upon any occasion, or that
   may be a little more than ordinary, but mostly an astonishment arising
   from the contemplation of some ruthful spectacle. So Lev. xxvi. 32, "I
   will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies which dwell
   therein shall be astonished at it;" and the word is near twenty times
   used to the same purpose. This by way of diminution is made, "mirati
   sunt, admirationi erit."

   2. This astonishment of men is by Grotius referred both to the
   dejection and exaltation of Jeremiah, whereof there is nothing in the
   words. It is the amazement of men at the despicable condition of him
   that is spoken of only that is intended; but without intruding
   something of his exaltation, this discourse had wanted all colour or
   pretext.

   3. Was it so great a matter in Jerusalem that a prophet should be put
   in prison there, where they imprisoned, stoned, tortured, and slew them
   almost all, one after another, in their several generations, that it
   should be thus prophesied of as a thing that men would and should be
   amazed at? Was it any wonder at all in that city, whose streets not
   long before had run with the blood of innocent men, that a prophet
   should be cast into prison? Or was this peculiar to Jeremiah to be
   dealt so withal? Is it any matter of astonishment to this very day? Was
   his honour afterward such an amazing thing, in that for a little season
   he was suffered to go at liberty, and had victuals given him? Was not
   this, as to the thing itself, common to him with many hundred others?
   Were his afflictions such as to be beyond compare with those of any
   man, or any of the sons of men? or his honours such as to dazzle the
   eyes of men with admiration and astonishment? Let a man dare to make
   bold with the word of God, and he may make as many such applications as
   he pleaseth, and find out what person he will to answer all the
   prophecies of the Messiah. This not succeeding, let us try the next
   verse:--

   "So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths
   at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see, and that
   which they had not heard shall they consider."

   "Ita asperget gentes multas. In Hebræo, Sic asperget,' ut respondeat
   illi, sicut,' quod præcessit. Multos ex gentibus ab idolorum cultu
   avertet. Similitudo sumpta ab aspersionibus legalibus; unde et Chaldæis
   nzh? est objurgare. At LXX. habent, Houto thaumasontai ethne polla ep
   auto, non male; nam mirari est aspergi fulgore alicujus;" -- "In the
   Hebrew it is, So he shall sprinkle,' that it might answer to the as'
   that went before. He shall turn many of the nations from the worship of
   idols. A similitude taken from the legal washings; whence nzh? with the
   Chaldees is to rebuke.' The LXX. render it, So shall many nations
   wonder at him,' not badly; for to wonder is as it were to be sprinkled
   with any one's brightness.'

   For the exposition of the words, --

   1. We agree that it is, "So he shall sprinkle," an apodosis, relating
   to the protasis, verse 14, "As many were astonished," etc.; the great
   work of Christ and his exaltation therein being rendered in opposition
   to his humiliation and dejection, before mentioned. As he was in so
   mean a condition that men were astonished at him, so he shall be
   exalted, in his great work of converting the nations, to their
   admiration.

   2. It is granted that the expression, "He shall sprinkle," is an
   allusion to the legal washings and purifications; which as they were
   typical of real sanctification and holiness, so from them is the
   promise thereof so often expressed in the terms of "washing" and
   "cleansing," Ezek. xxxvi. 25, the term being preserved and used in the
   New Testament frequently; the blood of Christ, whereby this work is
   done, being therefore called "the blood of sprinkling," Heb. xii. 24,
   Eph. v. 25, 26. The pouring out of the Spirit by Jesus Christ, for the
   purifying and sanctifying of many nations, not the Jews only, but the
   children of God throughout the world, by faith in his blood, is that
   which is here intended. What the use of nzh? in the Chaldee to this
   purpose is I know not.

   3. The LXX. have very badly rendered the words, "Many nations shall
   wonder at him," both as to words and sense; for, -- (1.) As the words
   will not bear it, so, (2.) They make that the action of the nations
   towards Christ which is his towards them. They lose the whole sense of
   the words; and what they say falls in with what follows, and is clearly
   expressed. (3.) It is not helped by the explanation given to it by the
   annotator. The first expression is metaphorical, which the LXX. render
   by a word proper, remote from the sense intended, which the annotator
   explains by another metaphor; by which kind of procedure, men may lead
   words and senses whither and which way they please.

   4. [As] for the accommodation of the words to Jeremiah, how did he
   sprinkle many nations, so as to answer the type of legal cleansing? Did
   he pour out the Spirit upon them? did he sanctify and make them holy?
   did he purge them from their iniquities? "But he turned many amongst
   the nations from the worship of idols." But who told Grotius so? where
   is it written or recorded? He prophesied, indeed, of the desolation of
   idols and idolaters. Of the conversion of many, of any, among the
   heathen by his preaching, he being not purposely sent to them, what
   evidence have we? If a man may feign what he please, and affix it to
   whom he please, he may make whom he will to be foretold in any
   prophecy.

   "Kings shall shut their mouths at him." "Reges, ut Nebuchodonosor
   Chaldæorum, et Nechos Ægyptiorum, eorumque satrapæ, admirabuntur cum
   silentio, ubi videbunt omnia quæ dicet Jeremias ita adamussim et suis
   temporibus impleta;" -- "Kings, as Nebuchodonosor of the Chaldees, and
   Necho of the Egyptians, and their princes, shall admire with silence,
   when they shall see all things foretold by Jeremiah come to pass
   exactly and to be fulfilled in their own time."

   That by this expression wonder and amazement is intended is agreed. As
   men, all sorts of men, before were astonished at his low condition, so
   even the greatest of them shall be astonished at the prosperity of his
   work and exaltation. The reason of this their shutting their mouths in
   silence and admiration is from the work which he shall do, -- that is,
   "he shall sprinkle many nations," -- as is evident from the following
   reason assigned: "For that which hath not been told them shall they
   see;" which expresseth the means whereby he should "sprinkle many
   nations," even by the preaching of the gospel to their conversion.

   [As] for the application hereof to Jeremiah:-- 1. That the kings
   mentioned did so become silent with admiration at him and astonishment
   is agraphon: and all these magnificent thoughts of the Chaldeans'
   dealing with Jeremiah are built only on this, that looking on him as a
   man that had dissuaded the Jews from their rebellion against them, and
   rebuked all their wickedness, and foretold their ruin, they gave him
   his life and liberty. 2. The reason assigned by Grotius why they should
   so admire him is for his predictions; but the reason of the great
   amazement and astonishment at him in the text is his sprinkling of many
   nations: so that nothing, not a word or expression, doth here agree to
   him; yea, this gloss is directly contrary to the letter of the text.

   The close of these words is, "That which had not been told them shall
   they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider;" of
   which he says, "They shall see that come to pass, foreseen and foretold
   by him, which they had not heard of by their astrologers or magicians."

   1. But what is it that is here intended? the desolation of Jerusalem?
   That was it which Jeremiah foretold, upon the account whereof he had
   that respect with the Chaldees which, through the mercy of God, he
   obtained. Is this that which is thus emphatically expressed, "That
   which they had not heard, that which they had not been told, this they
   should see, this they should consider?" That this is directly spoken of
   Jesus Christ, that he is the thing which they had not seen nor heard
   of, the apostle tells us, Rom. xv. 21. Strange that this should be the
   desolation of Jerusalem!

   2. It is probable that the magicians and astrologers, whose life and
   trade it was to flatter their kings with hope of success in their wars
   and undertakings, had foretold the taking of Jerusalem, considering
   that the king of the Chaldees had used all manner of divinations before
   he undertook the war against it, Ezek. xxi. 21, 22. It is too much
   trouble to abide on such vain imaginations; nor doth Grotius take any
   care to evidence how that which he delivers as the sense of the words
   may so much as be typically spoken of Jesus Christ, or be any way
   accommodated to him.

   The prophet proceeds, chap. liii., with the same continued discourse:
   Verse 1, "Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the
   Lord revealed?" which words are thus illustrated by the annotator:--

   "Vultis scire, inquit, quis ille sit futurus de quo coepi agere, qui et
   meis prophetiis plenam habebit fidem, et ipse de maximis rebus quas
   potentia Dei peraget revelationes accipiet exactissimas, omnibus
   circumstantiis additis? dabo vobis geminas ejus notas undo cognosci
   possit. Hæ notæ in Jeremiam quidem congruunt prius, sed potius in
   sublimifisque, sæpe et magis kata lexin, in Christum;" -- "?Will ye
   know,' saith he, who he shall be of whom I have begun to treat, who
   shall both fully believe my prophecies and shall himself receive most
   exact revelations of the great things that the power of God shall bring
   to pass, all the circumstances being added? I will give you two notes
   of him by which he may be known.' These notes, in the first place,
   agree to Jeremiah, but rather to Christ."

   1. I suppose if we had not had the advantage of receiving quite another
   interpretation of these words from the Holy Ghost himself in the New
   Testament, yet it would not have been easy for any to have swallowed
   this gloss, that is as little allied to the text as any thing that can
   possibly be imagined. The Holy Ghost tells us that these words are the
   complaint of the prophet and the church of believers unto God.
   concerning the paucity of them that would believe in Christ, or did so
   believe, when he was exhibited in the flesh, the power of the Lord with
   him for our salvation being effectually revealed to very few of the
   Jews. So John xii. 37, 38, "But though he had done so many miracles
   before them, yet they believed not on him: that the saying of Esaias
   the prophet might be fulfilled, Lord, who hath believed our report? and
   to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?" So Rom. x. 16, "But
   they have not all obeyed the gospel; for Esaias saith, Lord, who hath
   believed our report?"

   2. Let us now a little compare these several interpretations: "Who hath
   believed our report?" -- "Lord, how few do believe on Christ, working
   miracles himself, and preached by the apostles." "Jeremiah shall
   believe my prophecies," saith Grotius. "To whom is the arm of the Lord
   revealed?" -- "To how few is the power of God unto salvation made known
   by the Holy Ghost." "Jeremiah also shall have clear revelations," says
   Grotius. And this is counted learnedly to interpret the Scriptures! and
   every day are such annotations on the Scripture multiplied.

   3. It is not, then, the prophet's prediction of what he should do of
   whom he treats, what he should believe, what he should receive, whereof
   there is notice given in this verse; but what others shall do in
   reference to the preaching of him. They shall not believe: "Who hath
   believed?"

   4. The annotator tells us these words do agree to Christ chiefly and
   magis, kata lexin. This, then, must be the signification of them,
   according to his interpretation, in relation unto Christ, "He shall
   believe the prophecies of Isaiah, and receive revelations of his own."
   For my part, I am rather of the mind of John and Paul concerning these
   words than of the learned annotator's.

   5. There is no mention of describing the person spoken of by "two
   notes;" but in the first words the prophet enters upon the description
   of Christ, what he was, what he did and suffered for us, which he
   pursues to the end of the chapter.

   Verse 2, "For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a
   root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we
   shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him."

   An entrance is made in these words into the account that the prophet
   intends to give why so few believed in Christ, the Messiah, when he
   came, after they had looked for him and desired him so long, -- namely,
   his great unsuitableness to their expectation. They looked for a person
   shining in honour and glory, raising a visible, pompous, terrene
   kingdom, whereof they should be made partakers. But Christ when he
   comes indeed grows up, both in his human nature and his kingdom, as a
   tender plant, -- obnoxious to the incursions of beasts, winds, and
   storms, and treading-on of every one; yet, preserved by the providence
   of God, under whose eye and before whom he grew up, he shall prosper.
   And he shall be as a root preserved in the dry ground of the parched
   house of David and poor family of Mary and Joseph, -- every way
   outwardly contemptible; so that from thence none could look for the
   springing of such a "Branch of the Lord." And whereas they expected
   that he should appear with a great deal of outward form, loveliness,
   beauty, and every thing that should make a glorious person desirable,
   when they come to see him indeed in his outward condition, they shall
   not be able to discover any thing in the world for which they should
   desire him, own him, or receive him. And therefore after they shall
   have gone forth, upon the report that shall go of him, to see him, they
   shall be offended, and return and say, "Is not this the carpenter's
   son? and are not his brethren with us?" This sword of the Lord, which
   lies at the heart of the Jews to this day, the learned annotator
   labours to ease them of, by accommodating these words to Jeremiah;
   which, through the favour of the reader, I shall no otherwise refute
   than by its repetition: "?For he shall grow up before the Lord as a
   tender plant;' -- Jeremiah shall serve God in his prophetical office
   whilst he is young. And as a root out of a dry ground;' -- He shall be
   born at Anathoth, a poor village. He hath no form nor comeliness;' --
   He shall be heavy and sad. And when we shall see him,' etc.; -- He
   shall not have an amiable countenance." Whom might not these things be
   spoken of, that was a prophet, if the name of Anathoth be left out, and
   some other supplied in the room thereof?

   The third verse pursues the description of the Messiah in respect of
   his abject outward condition; which being of the same import with the
   former, and it being not my aim to comment on the text, I shall pass
   by.

   Verse 4, "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet
   we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted."

   Having formerly given the sense of these words, and vindicated them
   from the exceptions of the Socinians I shall do no more but animadvert
   upon their accommodation to Jeremiah by Grotius. Thus, then, he, --

   "Vere languores nostros ipse tulit. Ille non talia meritus mala tulit
   quæ nos eramua meriti. Hæc omnia air dicturos Judæos post captam
   urbem;' -- "He that deserved no such thing underwent the evils that we
   had deserved. All these things he saith the Jews shall say after the
   taking of the city."

   It is of the unworthy dealing of the Jews with the prophet in Jerusalem
   during the siege that he supposes these words are spoken, and spoken by
   the Jews after the taking of the city. The sum is, "When he was so
   hardly treated, we deserved it, even to be so dealt withal, not he, who
   delivered the word of God."

   But, 1. The words are, "He hath borne our griefs, and carried our
   sorrows." That by "our griefs and sorrows," our sins and the punishment
   due to them are intended hath been declared. That the force of the
   words "bearing and carrying" do evince that he took them upon himself
   hath also been manifested. That he so took them as that God made them
   meet upon him, in his justice, hath likewise been proved. That by his
   bearing of them we come to have peace, and are freed, shall be farther
   cleared, as it is expressly mentioned, verses 5, 11. Let us now see how
   this may be accommodated to Jeremiah. Did he undergo the punishment due
   to the sins of the Jews, or did they bear their own sins? Did God cause
   their sins to meet on him then when he bare them, or is it not
   expressly against his law that one should bear the sins of another?
   Were the Jews freed, -- had they peace by Jeremiah's sufferings; or
   rather, did they not hasten their utter ruin? If this be to interpret
   the Scripture, I know not what it is to corrupt it.

   2. There is not the least evidence that the Jews had any such thoughts,
   or were at all greatly troubled, after the taking of the city by the
   Chaldeans, concerning their dealings with Jeremiah, whom they afterward
   accused to his face of being a false prophet, and lying to them in the
   name of the Lord. Neither are these words supposed to be spoken by the
   Jews, but by the church of God.

   "Et nos putavimus eum quasi leprosum ac percussum d Deo et humiliatum.
   Nos credidimus Jeremiarn merito conjectum in carcerem et lutum, Deo
   illum exosum habente, ut hostem urbis, templi, et pseudo-prophetam,"
   Grotius; -- "We believed that Jeremiah was deservedly cast into the
   prison and mire, God hating him as an enemy of the city and temple, and
   as a false prophet." But, --

   1. These words may be thus applied to any prophet whatever that
   suffered persecution and martyrdom from the Jews (as who of them did
   not, the one or the other?) for they quickly saw their error and
   mistake as to one, though at the same time they fell upon another, as
   our Saviour upbraideth the Pharisees. Nor, --

   2. Was this any such great matter, that the Jews should think a true
   prophet to be a false prophet, and therefore deservedly punished, as in
   the law was appointed, that it should thus signally be foretold
   concerning Jeremiah. But that the Son of God, the Son and heir of the
   vineyard, should be so dealt withal, this is that which the prophet
   might well bring in the church thus signally complaining of. Of him to
   this day are the thoughts of the Jews no other than as here recorded;
   which they express by calling him tlvy?.

   The reason of the low condition of the Messiah, which was so
   misapprehended of the Jews, is rendered in the next verse, and their
   mistake rectified:--

   "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
   iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his
   stripes we are healed."

   I suppose it will not be questioned but that these words belong to our
   blessed Saviour, and that redemption which he wrought for us by his
   blood and death, Not only the full accomplishment of the thing itself
   as delivered in the New Testament, but the quotation of the words
   themselves to that end and purpose, 1 Pet. ii. 24, doth undeniably
   evince it. In what sense the words are to be understood of him we have
   formerly declared; that in that sense they are applicable to any other
   will not be pleaded. That they have any other sense is yet to be
   proved. To this, thus the annotator:--

   "Ipse autem vulneratus est propter iniquitates nostras. In Hebræo, At
   veto ipse vulneratus' (id est, male tractatus est) nostro crimine.' In
   nobis culpa fuit, non in ipso. Sic et quod sequitur, Attritus est per
   nostram culpam.' Iniquissima de eo sensimus, et propterea crudeliter
   eum tractavimus: id nunc rebus ipsis apparet. Similia dixerunt Judsei
   qui se converterunt die Pentecostes, et deinceps," Grot.; -- "?But he
   was wounded for our transgressions.' In the Hebrew, But he was wounded'
   (that is, evilly entreated) by our fault.' The fault was in us, not in
   him. And so that which follows, He was bruised by our fault.' We
   thought ill of him, and therefore handled him cruelly. This, now, is
   evident from the things themselves. The like things said the Jews who
   converted themselves on the day of Pentecost, and afterward."

   The reading of the words must first be considered, and then their sense
   and meaning; for against both these doth the learned annotator
   transgress, perverting the former that he might the more easily wrest
   the latter.

   1. "He was wounded for our sins, crimine nostro," "by our crime;" that
   is, it was our fault, not his, that he was so evilly dealt with. And
   not to insist on the word "wounded," or "tormented with pain," which is
   slightly interpreted by "evil-entreated," the question is, whether the
   efficient or procuring and meritorious cause of Christ's wounding be
   here expressed.

   2. The words used to express this cause of wounding are two, and both
   emphatical. The first is ps?: "He was wounded mpsynv?, for our
   prevarications, our proud transgressing of the law." "ps? est
   rebellare, et exire a voluntate Domine vel præcepto, ex superbia," R.
   D. in Michi. It is, properly, to rebel against man or God. Against man:
   2 Kings iii. 7, "The king of Moab phs?, hath rebelled against me;" and
   chap. viii. 20, "In his days Edom ps?, rebelled." As also against God:
   Isa. i. 2, "I have brought up children, and they psv?, have rebelled
   against me." Nor is it used in any other sense in the Scriptures but
   for prevarication and rebellion with a high hand, and through pride.
   The other word is vh?: "He was bruised mvnvtynv?, for our iniquities."
   The word signifies a declining from the right way with perversity and
   frowardness. "vh? est inique vel perverse agere; proprie curvum esse
   vel incurvari." So that all sorts of sins are here emphatically and
   distinctly expressed, even the greatest rebellion, and most perverse,
   crooked turning aside from the ways of God.

   3. Their causality in reference to the wounding of him here mentioned
   is expressed in the preposition mn?, which properly is "de, ex, a, e,"
   "from," or "for." Now, to put an issue to the sense of these words, and
   thence, in a good measure, to the sense of this place, let the reader
   consult the collections of the use of this preposition in Pagnine,
   Buxtorf, Calasius, or any other. When he finds it with "sin," as here,
   and relating to punishment, if he find it once to signify any thing but
   the meritorious procuring cause of punishment, the learned annotator
   may yet enjoy his interpretation in quietness. But if this be so, if
   this expression do constantly and perpetually denote the impulsive,
   procuring cause of punishment, it was not well done of him to leave the
   preposition quite out in the first place, and in the next place so to
   express it as to confine it to signify the efficient cause of what is
   affirmed.

   This, then, being the reading of the words, "He was wounded or
   tormented for our sins," the sense as relating to Jesus Christ is
   manifest: "When we thought he was justly for his own sake, as a seducer
   and malefactor, smitten of God, he was then under the punishment due to
   our iniquities, was so tormented for what we had deserved." This is
   thus rendered by our annotator: "Jeremiah was not in the fault, who
   prophesied to us, but we, that he was so evilly dealt with. He was
   bruised for our iniquities;' that is, we thought hard of him, and dealt
   evilly with him;' -- which may pass with the former.

   The LXX. render these words, Autos de etraumatisthe dia tas hamartias
   hemon kai memalakistai dia tas anomias hemon. Rightly! to be wounded
   dia tas hamartias is to be wounded for and not by sin, no otherwise
   than that also signifies the impulsive cause. And the Chaldee
   paraphrast, not able to avoid the clearness of the expression denoting
   the meritorious cause of punishment, and yet not understanding how the
   Messiah should be wounded or punished, thus rendered the words: "Et
   ipse sedificabit domum sanctuarii nostri, quod violatum est propter
   peccata nostra, et traditum est propter iniquitates nostras;" -- "He
   shall build the house of our sanctuary, which was violated for our
   sins" (that is, as a punishment of them) "and delivered for our
   iniquities." So he. Not being able to offer sufficient violence to the
   phrase of expression, nor understanding an accommodation of the words
   to him spoken of, he leaves the words with their own proper
   significancy, but turns their intendment, by an addition to them of his
   own.

   Proceed we to the next words, which are exegetical of these: "The
   chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are
   healed." Of these thus the annotator:--

   "Disciplina pacis nostræ super Apud eum: id est, monitis nobis attulit
   salutaria, si ea recepissemus;" -- "He gave us wholesome warnings, if
   we would have received them."

   But, -- 1. There is in this sense of the words nothing peculiar to
   Jeremiah. All the rest of the prophets did so, and were rejected no
   less than he.

   2. The words are not, "He gave us good counsel, if we would have taken
   it;" but, "The chastisement of our peace was upon him." And what
   affinity there is between these two expressions, that the one of them
   should be used for the explication of the other, I profess I know not.
   Peter expounds it by, "He bare our sins in his own body on the tree," 1
   Pet. ii. 24.

   3. The word rendered by us "chastisement," and by the Vulgar Latin,
   which Grotius follows, "disciplina," is mvsr?, which as it hath its
   first signification "to learn," so it signifies also "to correct,"
   because learning is seldom carried on without correction; and thence
   "disciplina" signifies the same. Now, what is the "correction of our
   peace?" Was it the instruction of Christ, -- not that he gave, but that
   he had, -- that we have our peace by? The word lyv?, he renders "apud
   eum," contrary to the known sense of the word. lh? is "to ascend, to
   lift up, to make to ascend," a word of most frequent use; thence is the
   word used rendered "super," intimating that the chastisement of our
   peace was made to ascend on him. As Peter expresseth the sense of this
   place, Hos tas hamartias hemon autos anenenken en to somati hautou epi
   to xulon. -- "He carried up our sins on his body on the tree;" they
   were made to ascend on him. The LXX. render the words ep' auton; the
   Vulgar Latin, "super eum;" and there is not the least colour for the
   annotator's "apud eum." Now, "the chastisement of our peace," -- that
   is, the punishment that was due that we might have peace, or whereby we
   have peace with God, -- "was upon him," is, it seems, "He gave us good
   counsel and admonition, if we would have followed it"!

   4. Here is no word expressing any act of the person spoken of, but his
   suffering or undergoing punishment. But of this enough. "Et livore ejus
   sanati sumus. Livors ejus (id est, ipsius patientia), nos sanati
   fuissemus: id est, liberati ab impendentibus malis, si verbis ipsius,
   tanta malorum tolerantia confirmatis, habuissemus fidem. Hebræi
   potentialem modum aliter quam per indicativum exprimere nequeunt; ideo
   multa adhibenda attentio ad consequendos sensus;" -- "?With his stripes
   we are healed.' With his wound, or sore, or stripe, that is, by his
   patience, we might have been healed, that is, freed from impendent
   evils, had we believed his words, confirmed with so great bearing of
   evils. The Hebrews cannot express the potential mood but by the
   indicative; therefore much attention is to be used to find out the
   sense."

   I cannot but profess that, setting aside some of the monstrous figments
   of the Jewish rabbins, I never in my whole life met with an
   interpretation of Scripture offering more palpable violence to the
   words than this of the annotator. Doubtless, to repeat it, with all
   sober men, is sufficient to confute it I shall briefly add, --

   1. The prophet says, "We are healed;" the annotator, "We might have
   been healed, but are not"

   2. The healing in the prophet is by deliverance from sin, mentioned in
   the words foregoing, and so interpreted by Peter, 1 Ep. ii. verse 24,
   whereby we have peace with God, which we have; the healing in the
   annotator is the deliverance from the destruction by the Chaldeans,
   which they were not delivered from, but might have been.

   3. chvvrh? in the prophet is molops in Peter, but "patience" in the
   annotator.

   4. "By his stripes we are healed," is in the annotator, "By hearkening
   to him we might have been healed," or delivered from the evils
   threatened. "By his stripes;" that is, "By hearkening to his counsel,
   when he endured evils patiently." "We are healed," that is, "We might
   have been delivered, but are not."

   5. As to the reason given of this interpretation, that the Hebrews have
   no potential mood, I shall desire to know who compelled the learned
   annotator to suppose himself wiser than the Holy Ghost, 1 Pet. ii. 24,
   to wrest these words into a potential signification which he expresseth
   directly, actually, indicativety? For a Jew to have done this out of
   hatred and enmity to the cross of Christ had been tolerable; but for a
   man professing himself a Christian, it is a somewhat strange attempt.

   6. To close with this verse, we do not esteem ourselves at all
   beholding to the annotator for allowing an accommodation of these words
   to our blessed Saviour, affirming that the Jews who converted
   themselves (for so it must be expressed, lest any should mistake, and
   think their conversion to have been the work of the Spirit and grace of
   God) on the day of Pentecost used such words as those that the Jews are
   feigned to use in reference to Jeremiah. It is quite of another
   business that the prophet is speaking; not of the sin of the Jews in
   crucifying Christ, but of all our sins, for which he was crucified.


   "Muners magna quidem misit sed misit in homo."

   Martial. lib. vi. Ep. 63.

   Verse 6, "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
   to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."

   Grotius: "Erraveramus jam a Manassis temporibus, alii ad alia idola; et
   permisit Deus ut ille nostro gravi crimine indignissima pateretur;" --
   "We have all erred from the days of Manasseh, some following some
   idols, others others; and God permitted that he by our grievous crime
   should suffer most unworthy things."

   Though the words of this verse are most important, yet having at large
   before insisted on the latter words of it, I shall be brief in my
   animadversions on the signal depravation of them by the learned
   annotator. Therefore, --

   1. Why is this confession of sins restrained to the times of Manasseh,
   and not afterward? The expression is universal, klnv?, "all of us," and
   a man to his own way. And if these words may be allowed to respect
   Jesus Christ at all, they will not bear any such restriction. But this
   is the proton pseudos of this interpretation, that these are the words
   of the Jews after the destruction of Jerusalem, which are the words of
   the converted Jews and Gentiles after the suffering of Jesus Christ.

   2. Why is the sin confessed restrained to idolatry? Men's "own ways,"
   which they walk in when they turn from the ways of God, and know not
   the ways of peace, comprehend all the evils of every kind that their
   hearts and lives are infected withal.

   3. The last words are unworthy a person of much less learning and
   judgment than the annotator; for, --

   (1.) The word hphgy? (of which before) is interpreted, without
   pretence, warrant, or colour, "permisit," -- God permitted. But of that
   word sufficiently before.

   (2.) By "his suffering unworthy things through our fault" he
   understands not the meritorious cause of his suffering, but the means
   whereby he suffered, even the unbelief and cruelty of the Jews; which
   is most remote from the sense of the place.

   (3.) He mentions here distinctly the fault of them that speak, and his
   suffering that is spoken of, "Permisit Deus ut ille nostro gravi
   crimine indignissima pateretur," when in the text the fault of them
   that speak is the suffering of him that is spoken of: "Our iniquities
   were laid on him," -- that is, the punishment due to them.

   (4.) His suffering in the text is God's act; in the Annotations, the
   Jews' only.

   (5.) There is neither sense nor coherence in this interpretation of the
   words, "We have all sinned and followed idols, and God hath suffered
   him to be evilly entreated by us;" when the whole context evidently
   gives an account of our deserving, and the way whereby we are
   delivered, and therein a reason of the low and abject condition of the
   Messiah in this world. But of this at large elsewhere.

   Verse 7, "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
   mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before
   her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth." "Oblatus est quia
   ipse voluit, et non aperuit os suum. In Heb., Oppressus et affiictus
   fuit, et non aperuit os suum.' Sensum bene exprimunt LXX. Kai autos dia
   to kekakosthai ouk anoigei to stoma autou. Etiam tunc cum in carcerem
   ageretur, et in locum lutosum, nihil fecit dixit ve iracunde.

   "Sicut ovis, Ovis mitissimum animal.

   "Et quasi agnus, cum quo ipse Jeremias se comparat, cap. xi. ver. 19."

   "?He was offered because he would, and he opened not his mouth." In the
   Hebrew, He was oppressed and afflicted.' The LXX. have well expressed
   the sense, Because of affliction he opened not his mouth.' Even then
   when he was thrown into the prison and mire, he neither did nor spake
   any thing angrily.

   "?As a sheep,' a most mild creature. "?And as a lamb,' wherewith
   Jeremiah compares himself, chap. xi. verse 19.'

   The process of the words is to give an account of the same matter
   formerly insisted on, concerning one's suffering for the sins of
   others. That the words are spoken of the Lord Jesus, the Holy Ghost
   hath long since put it out of question, Acts viii. 32. And though there
   be some difficulty and variety in the interpretation of the first
   words, yet his patient suffering as the Lamb of God, typed out by all
   the sacrifices of the Jews, under the punishment due to our sins,
   shines through the whole.

   1. For the words themselves, they are ngs vhv' nnh?, which are
   variously rendered: Kai autos dia to kekakosthai, LXX; -- "And he for
   (or because of) affliction." "Oblatus est quia ipse voluit," Vulg.
   Lat.; -- He was offered because he would." "Oppressus estet ipse
   affiictus est," Arias Montanus. "Exigitur et ipse affiigitur," Junius;
   -- "It was exacted, and he was afflicted." Others, "It was exacted, and
   he answered," which seems most to agree with the letter. ngs? is
   sometimes written with the point on the right corner of s?, and then it
   signifies "to approach, to draw nigh;" and in the matter of sacrifice
   it signifies "to offer," because men drew nigh to the Lord in offering.
   So Amos v. 25, hgstm ly?, "Have ye made to draw nigh your offerings and
   sacrifices?" or, "Have ye offered? Thus the Vulgar Latin read the word,
   and rendered it "Oblatus est," -- "He was offered." With the point on
   the left corner, it is "to exact, to require, to afflict, to oppress."
   To exact and require at the hands of any is the most common sense of
   the word. So 2 Kings xxiii. 35, "Jehoiakim exacted the silver and the
   gold of the people of the land." Thence is nvgs? "an exactor," one that
   requires what is imposed on men, Zech. ix. 8, x. 4. Being used here in
   a passive sense, it is, "It was exacted and required of him," -- that
   is, the punishment due to our sins was required of Jesus Christ, having
   undertaken to be a sponsor; and so Junius hath supplied the words,
   "Exigitur poena," -- "Punishment was exacted." And this is more proper
   than what we read, "He was oppressed," though that also be significant
   of the same thing. How the punishment of our sins was exacted or
   required of Jeremiah the annotator declares not.

   The other word is nnh?. The Vulgate Latin seems to look to the active
   use of the word, "to answer," and therefore renders it "voluit," "he
   would," -- he willingly submitted to it, or he undertook to do that
   which was exacted; and much may be said for this interpretation from
   the use of the word in Scripture. And then the sense will be, "It was
   exacted of him, or our punishment was required of him, and he undertook
   it with willingness and patience." So it denotes the win of Christ in
   undergoing the penalty due to our sins; which he expresseth, Ps. xl. 8,
   Heb. x. 6, 7. Take it in the sense wherein it is most commonly used,
   and it denotes the event of the exacting the penalty of our sins of
   him: "He was afflicted." In what sense this may possibly be applied to
   Jeremiah, I leave to the annotator's friends to find out.

   2. The next words, "He openeth not his mouth," he applies unto the
   patience of Jeremiah, who did neither speak nor do any thing angrily
   when he was cast into prison. Of that honour which we owe to all the
   saints departed, and in an especial manner to the great builders of the
   church of God, the prophets and apostles, this is no small part, that
   we deliver them from under the burden of having that ascribed to them
   who are members which is peculiar to their Head. I say, then, the
   perfect submission and patience expressed in these words were not found
   in holy Jeremiah, who in his affliction and trial opened his mouth and
   cursed the day wherein he was born; and when he says that himself was
   as a lamb, and as an ox appointed to the slaughter, in the same place,
   and at the same time, he prays for vengeance on his adversaries, Jer.
   xi. 20; in those words not denoting his patience, but his being exposed
   to their cruelty.

   Verse 8, "He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall
   declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the
   living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken."

   The person speaking is here changed, as is manifest from the close of
   the verse, "For the transgression of my people," who were the speakers
   before. These, then, are the words of God by the prophet; and they are
   not without their difficulties, concerning which the reader may consult
   commentators at large. Grotius thus:--

   "De carcere et de judicio ablatus est. Id est, liberatus tandem.
   Judicium vocat hoc, quia specie judicii ipsi hæc mala imposita fuerunt.
   Vide Jer. xxxii. 3, liberatus autem per Babylonios.

   "Generationem ejus quis enarrabit? Quis numerare poterit dies vitæ
   ejus? Id est, erit valde longsevus.

   "Quia abscissus est de terra viventium, nempe, cum actus fuit primum in
   carcerem, deinde in lacum illum coenosum, et rursum in carcerem."

   "?He was taken from prison and judgment.' That is, he was at length
   delivered. He calls it judgment,' because these evils were imposed on
   him with a pretence of judgment. But he was freed by the Babylonians.

   "?Who shall declare his generation?' Who shall be able to number the
   days of his life? That is, he shall live very long.

   "?For he was cut off out of the land of the living,' namely, when he
   was thrown into the prison, and then into the miry pit, and then into
   prison again."

   He adds, "?Propter soelus populi mei percussi eum.' In Heb. est, plaga
   ipsi, supple evenit, populi summo encore ac crimine, ut et ante dictum
   est;" -- "?For the wickedness of my people I have stricken him.' In the
   Hebrew it is, Stroke on him,' that is, befell him, through the great
   error and fault of the people, as is before said." So far he.

   The sense of these words being a little tried out, their application
   will be manifest. 1. The first words are not without their difficulty:
   mtsr?, "from prison," say we. The word is from tsr?, "prohibere,"
   "coercere," to "forbid," to "restrain," and is nowhere used for a
   prison directly. The LXX. have rendered it, En te tapeinosei he krisis
   autou erthe, -- "In his humility (or humiliation), his judgment (or
   sentence) was taken away," referring one of the words to one thing, and
   another to another. The Vulgar Latin, "angustia;" Arias Montanus, --
   "clausara;" Junius, "per coarctationem," rendering the preposition
   "by," not "from." The word is rendered by us "oppression," Ps. cvii.
   39. It is, at the utmost, in reference to a prison, "claustrum," a
   place where any may be shut up, but may as well be rendered "angustia"
   with the Vulgar Latin, better "coarctation" with Junius, being taken
   for any kind of strait and restraint. And, indeed, properly our Saviour
   was not cast into a prison, though he was all night under restraint. If
   the intendment of the words be about what he was delivered from, under
   which he was, and not what he was delivered from that he should not
   undergo it, vmmspt?, and "from judgment," there is no difficulty in the
   world. Only, whose judgment it is that he was taken from is worth
   inquiry, whether that of God or man. lqch?, "he was taken;" "ablatus
   est," the Vulgar Latin, "he was taken up." lqch? is "capere, accipere,
   ferre, tollere," a word of very large use, both in a good and in a bad
   sense; -- "to be taken up," it will scarcely be found to signify; "to
   be taken away," very often.

   Now, the sense of these words is, that either Christ was taken away,
   that is, killed and slain, by his pressures, and the pretended judgment
   that was passed on him, or else that he was delivered from the straits
   and judgment that might have come upon him. Although he was so
   afflicted, yet he was taken away from distress and judgment. Junius
   would have the former sense; and the exegesis of the word "taken away"
   by the following words, "He was cut off from the land of the living,"
   seems to require it. In that sense the words are, "By durance,
   restraint, affliction, and judgment," -- either the righteous judgment
   of God, as Junius, or the pretended juridical process of men, -- "he
   was taken away" or slain. If I go off from this sense of the words, of
   all other apprehensions, I should cleave to that of eternal restraint
   or condemnation, from which Christ was delivered in his greatest
   distress, Isa. i. 7, 8, Heb. v. 7. Though his afflictions were great
   and his pressures sore, yet he was delivered from eternal rester and
   condemnation, it being not possible that he should be detained of
   death.

   Applying all this to Jeremiah, says Grotius, "He was delivered from
   prison and judgment by the Babylonians." That lqch? is "delivered," and
   that he was delivered by the Babylonians from judgment, after that
   judgment had passed on him and sentence been executed for many months,
   is strange. But let us proceed to what follows:--

   2. "Who shall declare his generation?" -- "Who shall speak it, or be
   able to speak it?" dvrv?, "his generation." dvr? is "ætas, generatio,
   seeculum." Gr. genea Ten genean autou tis diegesetai; -- "Who shall
   expound his generation?" or declare it; that is, "Though he be so taken
   away by oppression and judgment, yet his continuance, his generation,
   his abiding, shall be such as quis eloquetur?' who shall speak it?" It
   shall be for ever and ever; for he was to be "satisfied with long or
   eternal life," and therein to "see the salvation of God."

   This is, says Grotius, "Who can declare the generation of Jeremiah, he
   shall live so great a space of time?" He began his prophecy when he was
   very young, chap. i. 5, even in the thirteenth year of Josiah, and he
   continued prophesying in Jerusalem until the eleventh year of Zedekiah,
   about forty years, and how long he lived after this is uncertain.
   Probably he might live in all sixty years, whereas it is evident that
   Hosea prophesied eighty years or very near. Now, that this should be so
   marvellous a thing, that a man should live sixty or seventy years, that
   God should foretell it as a strange thing above twice so many years
   before, and express it by way of admiration that none should be able to
   declare it, is such an interpretation of Scripture as becomes not the
   learned annotator. Let the learned reader consult Abrabanel's
   accommodation of these words to Josiah, and he will see what shifts the
   poor man is put to to give them any tolerable sense.

   3. "For he was cut off out of the land of the living." Hoti airetai apo
   tes he zoe autou -- "His life was taken from the earth;" to the sense,
   not the letter. ngzr?, "cut off," as a branch is cut off a tree. gzr?
   is "abscindere, succidere, extidere,' to cut off. "The land of the
   living" is the state and condition of them that live in this world; so
   that to be "cut off from the land of the living" is a proper expression
   for to be slain, as in reference to Christ it is expressed by another
   word, Dan. ix. 26. "The meaning of this is," says Grotius, "Jeremiah
   was cast into prison and into the miry lake. He was cut off out of the
   land of the living;' that is, he was put into prison twice, and taken
   out again." If this be not to offer violence to the word of God, I know
   not what is. The learned man confesses that this whole prophecy belongs
   to Christ also, but he leaves no sense to the words whereby they
   possibly may be applied to him. How was Christ cast into prison and a
   miry pit, and taken out from thence by the way of deliverance?

   4. "For the transgression of my people was he stricken." Of the sense
   of this expression, that Christ was stricken, or that the stroke of
   punishment was upon him, for our sins, or the sins of God's people, I
   have spoken before. Grotius would have it "by the sin;" that is, the
   "people sinned in doing of it;" that is, in putting Jeremiah into
   prison. The whole context evidently manifests, and the proposition in
   the relation wherein it stands to sin and punishment necessarily
   requires, that the impulsive and meritorious, not the efficient cause,
   be denoted thereby.

   Verse 9, "And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in
   his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in
   his mouth."

   "Et dabit impios pro sepultura, et divitem loro morte sua. Illi ipsum
   etiam interficere voluerant, ut legimus Jer. xxvi.. At Deus ipsius vice
   viros potentes quidem, sed improbos, sacerdotes nempe mortem Jeremiæ
   machinatos, morti dedit per Chaldæos 2 Reg. xxv. 18-21. Nihil illis
   divitiæ suæ profuerunt, quibus redimi se posse speraverant. Eo quod
   iniquitatem non fecerit, neque dolus fuerit in ore ejus. Quanquam nihil
   aliud dixerat quam quod Deus ei mandaverat;" -- "?And he shall give the
   wicked for his grave (or burial), and the rich for his death.' They
   would have slain him, as we read Jer. xxvi.. But God gave them that
   were very powerful, indeed, but wicked, even the priests that designed
   his death, up to death by the Chaldeans, 2 Kings xxv. 18-21. Their
   riches, whereby they hoped to redeem themselves, profited them nothing.
   Because he had done,' etc. Although he had not said any thing but what
   God commanded him."

   It is confessed that the first words are full of difficulty, and
   various are the interpretations of them, which the reader may consult
   in expositors. It is not my work at present to comment on the text, but
   to consider its accommodation by Grotius. The most simple sense of the
   words to me seems to be, that Christ, being cut off from the land of
   the living, had his sepulchre among wicked men, being taken down from
   the cross as a malefactor, and yet was buried in the grave of a rich
   man, -- by Joseph of Arimathea in his own grave; the consent of which
   interpretation with the text is discovered by Forsterus and Mercerus,
   names of sufficient authority in all Hebrew literature. The sense that
   Grotius fixes on is, that "God delivered Jeremiah from death, and gave
   others to be slain in his stead, who had contrived his death." But, --

   1. Of deliverance from death here is no mention; yea, he who is spoken
   of was bmtyv?, "in mortibus ejus," in his deaths, or under death and
   its power. So that it is not, "Others shall die for him," but, "He
   being dead, under the power of death, his grave, or burial, or
   sepulchre, shall be so disposed of."

   2. There is not any word spoken of putting others to death, but of
   giving or placing his grave with the wicked. Nor were those mentioned
   in 2 Kings xxv. 18-21, that were slain by the king of Babel, as it doth
   any way appear, of the peculiar enemies of Jeremiah, the chief of them,
   Seraiah, being probably he to whom Jeremiah gave his prophecy against
   Babylon, who is said to be a "quiet prince," Jer. li. 59-64.

   3. It is well that it is granted that pro is as much as vice, "for one,
   in one's stead;" which the learned annotator's friends will scarce
   allow.

   4. The application of these words, "He had done no violence, neither
   was any deceit in his mouth" (which are used to express the absolutely
   perfect innocency of the Son of God), to any man, who as a man is or
   was a liar, is little less than blasphemy; and to restrain them to the
   prophet's message from God is devoid of all pretence or plea.

   Verse 10, "Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to
   grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see
   his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall
   prosper in his hand."

   "Tamen Deo Visum est eum conterere et infirmare; id est, attenuare
   fame, illuvie, squalore. Verba activa apud Hebræos sæpe permittendi
   habent significatum. Causa sequitur cur id Deus permiserit, Si posuerit
   pro delicto animam suam, videbit semen longasvum. Verteris recto, ut
   cum semetipsum subjecerit poenis, videat semen, diuque vivat.' Hebræis
   poena etiam injuste irrogata 'sm? dicitur, quia infligitur si non
   sonti, certe quasi sonti: sic cht'? sumi apparet, Gen. xxxi. 39; Zach.
   xiv. 19. Vixit diu Jeremias in Egypto;" -- "?Yet it seemed good to God
   to bruise and weaken him;' that is, to weaken him, and bring him down
   by hunger, filth, etc. Active verbs among the Hebrews have often the
   signification of permitting. The reason follows why God suffered this,
   If he make his soul,' etc. You shall rightly read it, that when he hath
   submitted himself to punishment, then he may see his seed and live
   long.' Amongst the Hebrews punishment, [even though] unjustly
   inflicted, is called 'sm?, because it is inflicted on him that is
   guilty, [487] or supposed so: so it is evident that cht'? is taken,
   Gen. xxxi. 39; Zech. xiv. 19. Jeremiah lived long in Egypt."

   The words and sense are both briefly to be considered. 1. chphts?,
   "voluit," -- "The Lord would bruise him." "Delectatus est," Jun. "It
   pleased the Lord," say we. The Greek renders this word bouletai,
   properly, although in the following words it utterly departs from the
   original. The word is not only "velle," but "voluntatem seu
   complacentiam habere," -- to take delight to do the thing, and in the
   doing of it, which we will to be done, Num. xiv. 8; Judges xiii. 23.
   Our translation refers it to the purpose and good pleasure of God; so
   is the word used Jonah i. 14, and in sundry other places. The noun of
   the same signification is used again in this verse, chphts?, and is
   translated "The pleasure:" "The pleasure of the Lord shall prosper," --
   that is, the thing which pleases him, and which he hath purposed to do.
   The purpose and pleasure of the Lord in giving Christ up to death, Acts
   ii. 23, and iv. 27, 28, is doubtless that which the prophet here
   intends; which also, as to the execution of it, is farther expressed
   Zech. xiii. 7.

   2. It pleased the Lord dk'v?, "eum contundere, conterere, frangore," to
   bruise or break him; in answer to what was said before, verse 5, "He
   was wounded, he was bruised," etc.

   That which is said, to accommodate all this to Jeremiah, is, that by
   all this is intended that God permitted it to be done to him. But, --

   1. The word chphts? is nowhere used in that sense, nor will anywhere
   bear that interpretation. And though some active verbs in the Hebrew
   may be interpreted in a sense of permitting or suffering the thing to
   be done which is said to be done, yet that all may so be interpreted
   when we please, without a cogent reason for such an interpretation,
   [and] that this verb, signifying not only to will, but to will with
   delight and purpose, should be so interpreted, and that in this place,
   not admitting of such a gloss in any other place, is that which was
   needful to be said by the learned annotator, but with what pretence of
   reason or truth I know not.

   2. As to Christ, to whom he confesseth these words properly belong, the
   proper sense of the word is to be retained, as hath been showed; and it
   is very marvellous the improper sense of the word should be used in
   reference to him to whom it nextly belongs, and the proper in reference
   to him who is more remotely and secondarily signified.

   For the second passage, "When (or if thou shalt) he shall make his soul
   an offering for sin," or, as it may be read, "When his soul shall make
   an offering for sin," it may relate either to God giving him up for a
   sacrifice, -- his soul for his whole human nature, -- or to Christ,
   whose soul was [offered], or who offered himself, as a sacrifice to
   God, Eph. v. 2. Which way soever it be taken, it is peculiar to Christ;
   for neither did God ever make any one else an offering for sin, nor did
   ever any person but Christ make himself an offering, or had power so to
   do, or would have been accepted in so doing. To suit these words to
   Jeremiah, it is said that 'sm? in the Hebrew signifies any punishment,
   though unjustly inflicted.

   I will not say that the learned annotator affirms this with a mind to
   deceive, but yet I cannot but think that as he hath not given so he
   could not give one instance out of the Scripture of that use of the
   word which he pretends. This I am sure of, that his assertion hath put
   me to the labour of considering all the places of Scripture where the
   word is used in the full collections of Calasius, and I dare
   confidently assure the reader that there is no colour for this
   assertion, nor instance to make it good. The Greeks have rendered it
   peri hamartias, "an offering for sin," as is expressed, Rom. viii. 3,
   Heb. x. 6, 8: so the word is used Lev. v. 16, vii. 1. But, --

   If 'sm? be not used in that sense, yet cht'? is, in Gen. xxxi. 39,
   Zech. xiv. 19. But, --

   1. This doth not satisfy, "If this word may not be so interpreted which
   is here used, yet another, which is not here used, may be so
   interpreted; and therefore that which is here used must have the same
   sense!" Nor, --

   2. Can he prove that cht'? [cht'h?] hath any other signification but
   either of sin, or punishment, or satisfaction. In the first place
   instanced in, Gen. xxxi. 39, Jacob says that for that which was taken
   away out of the flock of Laban, he expiated it, he made satisfaction
   for it, as the law afterward required in such cases should be done,
   Exod. xxii. 12; and in that place of Zech. xiv. 19, it is precisely
   punishment for sin. But this word is not in our text.

   Take, then, the word in any sense that it will admit of, to apply this
   expression to Jeremiah is no less than blasphemy. To say that either
   God or himself made him a sacrifice for sin is to blaspheme the one
   sacrifice of the Son of God.

   For the next words, "He shall see his seed," Grotius knows not how to
   make any application of them to Jeremiah, and therefore he speaks
   nothing of them. How they belong to Christ is evident, Ps. xxii. 30,
   Heb. ii. 8. That "he shall prolong his days" is not applicable to
   Jeremiah, of whom the annotator knew not how long he lived in Egypt,
   hath been formerly declared. Christ prolonged his days, in that
   notwithstanding that he was dead he is alive, and lives for ever.

   The last clause, concerning the prospering of the good pleasure, the
   will and pleasure, of the Lord, in the hand of Jesus Christ, for the
   gathering of his church through his blood, and making peace between God
   and man, hath little relation to any thing that is spoken of Jeremiah,
   whose ministry for the conversion of souls doth not seem to have had
   any thing eminent in it above that of other prophets; yea, falling in a
   time when the wickedness of the people to whom he was sent was come up
   to the height, his message seemed to be almost totally rejected.

   Verse 11, "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
   satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many;
   for he shall bear their iniquities."

   The event and glorious issue of the suffering of Christ, in respect of
   himself and others, with the reason thereof, is briefly comprised and
   expressed in this verse.

   "Videbit et saturabitur. Videbit diu, ad satietatem. Simile loquendi
   genus in Hebræo, Gen. xxv. 8, xxxv. 29, 1 Paral. xxiii. 1, xxix. 28, 2
   Paral. xxiv. 15.

   "In scientia sua. Per eam quam habet Dei cognitionem.

   "Justificabit ipse justus servus meus multos. Exemplo et institutione
   corriget multos etiam ex gentibua Hæc est maxime propria verbi ytsdyq?
   significatio, et Græci dikaioun, ut apparet Dan. xii. 3, Rev. xxii. 11,
   et alibi sæpe.

   "Et iniquitates eorum ipse portabit. Id est, auferet, per metonumian,
   quia qui sordes aliquas auferunt solent eos collo supposito portare.
   Abstulit Jeremias multorum peccata, ita ut diximus, eos corrigendo."
   "?He shall see, and be satisfied.' He shall see long, unto satiety. The
   like phrase of speech you have in the Hebrew, Gen. xxv. 8, etc.

   "?By his knowledge.' By that knowledge which he hath of God.

   "?He shall justify many.' By his example and institution he shall
   convert many even from among the heathen. This is the most proper sense
   of the word ytsdyq?, and of dikaioun in the Greek, as appeareth, Dan.
   xii. 3, Rev. xxii. 11, etc.

   "?For he shall bear their iniquities;' that is, take them away, by a
   metonymy, because those that take away filth used to take it on their
   necks and bear it. Jeremiah took away the sins of many, as was said, by
   correcting or amending them."

   The intelligent reader will easily perceive the whole Socinian poison
   about the death of Christ to be infolded in this interpretation. His
   "knowledge" is the knowledge that he had of God and his will, which he
   declares; to "justify" is to amend men's lives; and to "bear sin" is to
   take it away. According to the analogy of this faith, you may apply the
   text to whom you please, as well as to Jeremiah. But the words are of
   another import, as we shall briefly see:--

   1. These words, mml nphsv?, which the Vulgar Latin renders "pro eo quod
   laboravit," ad verbum, "propter laborem animæ suæ," which express the
   object of the seeing mentioned, and that wherewith he was satisfied,
   are not taken notice of. The "travail of the soul" of Christ is the
   fruit of his labour, travail, and suffering. This, says the prophet, he
   "shall see," that is, "receive, perceive, enjoy," as the verb r'h? in
   many places signifies; verbs of sense with the Hebrews having very
   large significations. ysb?, "saturabitur," he shall be "full and
   well-contented," and pleased with the fruit that he shall have of all
   his labour and travail. This, saith Grotius, is, "He shall see to
   satiety," whereby he intends he should "live very long," as is evident
   from the places whither he sends us for an exposition of these words,
   Gen. xxv. 8, etc., in all which mention is made of men that were old
   and full of days.

   (1.) But to "live to satiety," is to live till a man be weary of
   living, which may not be ascribed to the prophet.

   (2.) This of his "long life" was spoken of immediately before,
   according to the interpretation of our annotator, and is not probably
   instantly again repeated.

   (3.) The long life of Jeremiah, by way of eminency above others, is but
   pretended, as hath been evinced. But, --

   (4.) How came this word, "to see," to be taken neutrally, and to
   signify "to live?" What instance of this sense or use of the word can
   be given? I dare boldly say, Not one. "He shall see unto satiety;" that
   is, "He shall live long."

   (5.) The words "videbit, saturabitur," do not stand in any such
   relation to one another or construction as to endure to be cast into
   this form. It is not "videbit diu ad satietatem," much less "vivet ad
   satietatem," but "videbit, saturabitur."

   (6.) The word "shall see" evidently relates to the words going before,
   "the travail of his soul." If it had been, "He shall see many years, or
   many days, and be satisfied," it had been something; but it is, "He
   shall see of the travail of his soul, and be satisfied."

   2. "By his knowledge," bdtv?, "In (or by) his knowledge;" "In scientia
   sua," Vulg. Lat.; "Cognitione sui," Jun. The LXX. wholly pervert all
   the words of this verse, except the last, as they do also of the
   former. That by the "knowledge" here mentioned is meant the knowledge
   of Christ taken objectively, and not the knowledge of God taken
   actively, as our annotator supposes, is evident from the fruit that is
   ascribed hereunto, which is the justification of them that have that
   knowledge: "By his knowledge," -- that is, the knowledge of him, --
   "they shall be justified," Phil. iii. 8. So, "Teach me thy fear," that
   is, "The fear of thee;" "My worship," that is, "The worship of me." No
   "knowledge of God" in the land. But the use of this is in the next
   words.

   3. "My righteous servant shall justify many." That this term, used thus
   absolutely, "My righteous servant," is not applied to any in the
   Scripture besides Jesus Christ, hath been declared; especially where
   that is ascribed to him which here is spoken of, it can be no otherwise
   understood. ytsdyq?, "shall justify," that is, shall absolve from their
   sins, and pronounce them righteous. Grotius would have the word here to
   signify, "to make holy and righteous by instruction and institution,"
   as Dan. xii. 3, and dikaioun, Rev. xxii. 11. That both these words are
   to be taken in a forensical signification; that commonly, mostly, they
   are so taken in the Scriptures; that scarce one and another instance
   can be given to the contrary; that in the matter of our acceptation
   with God through Christ they can no otherwise be interpreted, -- have
   been abundantly manifested by those who have written of the doctrine of
   justification at large: that is not now my present business, This I
   have from the text to lay in the way of the interpretation of the
   learned annotator.

   The reason and foundation of this justification here mentioned is in
   the following words, which indeed steer the sense of the whole text:--

   4. "For he shall bear their iniquities." Now, what justification of men
   is a proper effect of another's bearing their iniquities? Doubtless the
   acquitting of them from the guilt of their sins, on the account of
   their sins being so borne, and no other. But, says our annotator, "To
   bear their sins is to take them away," by a figurative expression. If
   this may not be understood, I suppose every one will confess that the
   annotator hath laboured in vain as to his whole endeavour of applying
   this prophecy unto Jeremiah. If by "bearing our iniquities" be intended
   the undergoing of the punishment of those iniquities, and not the
   delivering men from their iniquities, the whole matter here treated of
   can relate to none but Jesus Christ; and to him it doth relate in the
   sense contended for. Now, to evince this sense, we have all the
   arguments that any place is capable to receive the confirmation of its
   proper sense by. For, --

   (1.) The word, as is confessed, signifies properly to "bear" or
   "carry," and not to "take away," nor is it ever otherwise used in the
   Scripture, as hath been declared; and the proper use of a word is not
   to be departed from and a figurative one admitted without great
   necessity.

   (2.) The whole phrase of speech of "bearing iniquity" is constantly in
   the Scripture used for bearing or undergoing the punishment due to sin,
   as hath been proved by instances in abundance, nor can any instance to
   the contrary be produced.

   (3.) The manner whereby Christ "bore the iniquities of men," as
   described in this chapter, namely, by being "wounded," "bruised," "put
   to grief," will admit of no interpretation but that by us insisted on.
   From all which it is evident how violently the Scripture is here
   perverted, by rendering, "My righteous servant shall justify many, for
   he shall bear their iniquities," by "Jeremiah shall instruct many in
   godliness, and so turn them from their sins."

   Verse 12, "Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
   shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his
   soul unto death: and he was numbered with transgressors; and he bare
   the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors."

   A farther fruit of the travail of the Lord Christ, in his conquest over
   all oppositions, in the victory he obtained, the spoils that he made,
   expressed after the manner of the things of men, with the causes and
   antecedents of his exaltation, is summarily comprised in these last
   words. Hereof thus Grotius:--

   "Dispertiam ei plurimos. Dabo ei partem in multis; id est, multos
   servabunt Chaldæi in ejus gratiam, vide Jer. xxxix. 17.

   "Et fortium dividet spolia; id est, Nabuzardan magister militum, capta
   urbe, de præda ipsi dona mittet, Jer. xl. 5. Oblatum etiam ipsi a
   Chaldeis terræ quantum vellet.

   "Pro eo quod tradidit in mortem animam suam. In Hebræo, Quia effudit in
   mortem animam suam.' Id est, periculis mortis semet objecit colendo
   veritatem quæ odium parit. Vide historiam ad hanc rem oppositam, Jer.
   xxvi. 13. Sic tithenai psuchen dici pro periculo mortis semet objicere
   diximus ad, Johan. x. 11.

   "Et cum sceleratis reputatus est. Ita est tractatus quomodo scelerati
   solent in carcere, catenis, et barathro.

   "Et ipse peccata multorum tulit, pessime tractatus fuit per multorum
   improbitatem, uti sup. ver. 5.

   "Et pro transgressoribus rogavit. yphgy? est deprecari. Sensus est: eo
   ipso tempore cum tam dura pateretur a populo, non cessavit ad Deum
   preces pro eis fundere, vide Jer. xiv. 7," etc.

   "?I will divide him a portion with the great,' or many; that is the
   Chaldeans shall preserve many for his sake, Jer. xxxix. 17.

   "?He shall divide the spoil with the strong;' that is, Nebuzaradan, the
   chief captain, the city being taken, shall send him gifts of the prey,
   Jer. xl. 5. As much land also as he would was offered him by the
   Chaldeans.

   "?Because he poured out his soul unto death;' that is, he exposed
   himself to the danger of death by following truth, which begets hatred.
   See Jer. xxvi. 13. Tithenai psuchen is spoken for exposing a man's life
   to danger of death, John x. 11.

   "?He bare the sin of many,' or was evilly treated by the wickedness of
   the many.

   "?And made intercession for the transgressors.' He prayed for the
   people," etc.

   To run briefly over this exposition, --

   1. "I will divide him a portion with the great." That is, "The Chaldees
   shall save many for his sake." How is this proved? Jer. xxxix. 17, 18,
   where God says he will save Ebedmelech, because he put his trust in
   him! Such is the issue commonly when men will wrest the Scripture to
   their own imagination, -- such are their proofs of what they affirm.

   2. "He shall divide the spoil with the strong." That is, "The city
   being taken, the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward,
   and set him at liberty, as we read, Jer. xl. 5."

   3. "Because he poured out his soul unto death." That is, "He ventured
   his life by preaching the truth, although he did not die." For, --

   4. "He bare the sin of many," that is, "By the wickedness of many he
   was wronged;" though this expression in the verse foregoing be
   interpreted, "He shall take away their sins," and that when a word of a
   more restrained signification is used to express "bearing" than that
   here used. At this rate a man may make application of what he will to
   whom he will.

   Upon the sense of the words, and their accomplishment in and upon the
   Lord Jesus Christ, I shall not insist. That they do not respect
   Jeremiah at all is easily evinced from the consideration of the
   intolerable wresting of the words and their sense by the learned
   annotator to make the least allusion appear betwixt what befell him and
   what is expressed.

   To close these animadversions, I shall desire the reader to observe, --

   1. That there is not any application of these words made to the prophet
   Jeremiah, that suits him in any measure, bat what may also be made to
   any prophet or preacher of the word of God that met with affliction and
   persecution in the discharge of his duty, and was delivered by the
   presence of God with him; so that there is no reason to persuade us
   that Jeremiah was peculiarly intended in this prophecy.

   2. That the learned annotator, though he professes that Jesus Christ
   was intended in the letter of this scripture, yet hath interpreted the
   whole not only without the least mention of Jesus Christ or application
   of it unto him, but also hath so opened the several words and
   expressions of it as to leave no place or room for the main doctrine of
   his satisfaction, here principally intended. And how much the church of
   God is beholding to him for his pains and travail herein the reader may
   judge.

Chapter XXVI.

   Of the matter of the punishment that Christ underwent, or what he
   suffered.

   Having despatched this digression, I return again to the consideration
   of the death of Christ as it was a punishment, which shall now be
   pursued unto its issue.

   The third thing proposed to consideration on this account, was the
   matter of this punishment that Christ underwent, which is commonly
   expressed by the name of his "death."

   Death is a name comprehensive of all evil, of what nature or of what
   kind soever, -- all that was threatened, all that was ever inflicted on
   man. Though much of it falls within the compass of this life, and short
   of death, yet it is evil purely on the account of its relation to death
   and its tendency thereunto; which when it is taken away, it is no more
   generally and absolutely evil, but in some regard only.

   The death of Christ, as comprehending his punishment, may be considered
   two ways: 1. In itself; 2. In reference to the law.

   On the first head I shall only consider the general evident
   concomitants of it as they lie in the story, which are all set down as
   aggravations of the punishment he underwent; on the latter I shall give
   an account of the whole in reference to the law:--

   1. Of death natural, which in its whole nature is penal (as hath been
   elsewhere evinced), there are four aggravations, whereunto all others
   may be referred: as, -- (1.) That it be violent or bloody; (2.) That it
   be ignominious or shameful; (3.) That it be lingering and painful; (4.)
   That it be legal and accursed. And all these to the height met in the
   death of Christ.

   (1.) It was violent and bloody: hence he is said to be, -- [1.] Slain,
   Acts ii. 23, Aneilete, "Ye have slain;" [2.] Killed, Acts iii. 15,
   Apekteinate, "Ye have killed;" [3.] Put to death, John xviii. 31, 32;
   [4.] Cut off, Dan. ix. 26.

   The death of Christ and the blood of Christ are on this account in the
   Scripture the same. His death was by the effusion of his blood, and
   what is done by his death is still said to be done by his blood. And
   though he willingly gave up himself to God therein as he was a
   sacrifice, yet he was taken by violence and nailed to the cross as it
   was a punishment; and the dissolution of his body and soul was by a
   means no less violent than if he had been most unwilling thereunto.

   (2.) It was ignominious and shameful. [488] Such was the death of the
   cross, -- the death of slaves, malefactors, robbers, pests of the earth
   and burdens of human society, like those crucified with him. Hence he
   is said to be "obedient unto death, the death of the cross," Phil. ii.
   8, that shameful and ignominious death. And when he "endured the
   cross," he "despised the shame" also, Heb. xii. 2. To be brought forth
   and scourged as a malefactor amongst malefactors in the eye of the
   world, made a scorn and a by-word, men wagging the head and making
   mouths at him in derision, when he was full of torture, bleeding to
   death, is no small aggravation of it. Hence the most frequent
   expression of his death is by the cross, or crucifying.

   (3.) It was lingering. It was the voice of cruelty itself concerning
   one who was condemned to die, "Sentiat se mori,' -- "Let him so die
   that he may feel himself dying;" and of one who, to escape torture,
   killed himself, "Evasit,' -- "He escaped me." Sudden death, though
   violent, is an escape from torture. Such was this of Christ. From his
   agony in the garden, when he began to die (all the powers of hell being
   then let loose upon him), until the giving up of the ghost, it was from
   the evening of one day to the evening of another; from his scourging by
   Pilate, after which he was under continual pain and suffering in his
   soul and in his body, to his death, it was six hours; and all this
   while was he under exquisite tortures, as, on very many considerations,
   might easily be made manifest.

   (4.) It was legal, and so an accursed death. There was process against
   him by witness and judgment. Though they were, indeed, all false and
   unjust, yet to the eye of the world his death was legal, and
   consequently accursed: Gal. iii. 13, "Cursed is every one that hangeth
   on a tree," -- that is, because of the doom of the law, whose sentence
   is called a curse, Deut. xxi. 23. Such was that of Christ, Isa. liii.
   4.

   2. As all these aggravations attended his death as it was death itself,
   so there was a universality in all the concernments of it as it was a
   legal punishment. Briefly to give some instances:--

   (1.) There was a universality of efficient causes, whether principal or
   instrumental. The first great division of causes efficient is into the
   Creator and the creatures; and both here concurred:--

   [1.] The Creator, God himself, laid it upon him. He was not only
   "delivered by his determinate counsel," Acts ii. 22, 23, iv. 27, 28,
   not spared by him, but given up to death, Rom. viii. 32; but "it
   pleased him to bruise him, and to put him to grief," Isa. liii. 10, as
   also to "forsake him," Ps. xxii. 1: so acting in his punishment, by the
   immission of that which is evil and the subtraction of that which is
   good, so putting the cup into his hand which he was to drink, and
   mixing the wine thereof for him, as shall afterward be declared.

   [2.] Of creatures, one general division is into intelligent and brute
   or irrational; and both these also, in their several ways, concurred to
   his punishment, as they were to do by the sentence and curse of the
   law.

   Intelligent creatures are distinguished into spiritual and invisible,
   and visible and corporeal also:--

   1st. Of the first sort are angels and devils; which agree in the same
   nature, differing only in qualities and states or conditions. Of all
   beings, the angels seem to have had no hand in the death of Christ:
   for, being not judge, as was God; nor opposite to God, as is Satan; nor
   under the curse of the law, as is mankind and the residue of the
   creatures, -- though they had inestimable benefit by the death of
   Christ, yet neither by demerit nor efficacy, as is revealed, did they
   add to his punishment. Only, whereas it was their duty to have
   preserved him, being innocent, and in his way, from violence and fury,
   their assistance was withheld.

   But from that sort of spiritual invisible creatures he suffered in the
   attempts of the devil.

   Christ looked on him at a distance, in his approach to set upon him.
   "The prince of this world," saith he, "cometh," John xiv. 30. He saw
   him coming, with all his malice, fury, and violence, to set upon him,
   to ruin him if it were possible. And that he had a close combat with
   him on the cross is evident from the conquest that Christ there made of
   him, Col. ii. 15, which was not done without wounds and blood; when he
   brake the serpent's head, the serpent bruised his heel, Gen. iii. 15.

   2dly. As for men, the second rank of intellectual creatures, they had
   their influence into this punishment of Christ, in all their
   distributions that on any account they were cast into:--

   (1st.) In respect of country or nation, and the privileges thereon
   attending. The whole world on this account is divided into Jews and
   Gentiles; and both these had their efficiency in this business: Ps. ii.
   1, "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?"
   Heathen and people, Gentiles and Jews, are all in it, as the place is
   interpreted by the apostles, Acts iv. 25, 26. And to make this the more
   eminent, the great representatives of the two people conspired in it,
   the sanhedrim of the Jews and the body of the people in the
   metropolitical city on the one hand, and the Romans for the Gentiles,
   who then were "rerum domini," and governed oikoumenen, as Luke tells
   us, Luke ii. 1. The whole on both hands is expressed Matt. xx. 18, 10.

   (2dly.) As to order, men are distinguished into rulers and those under
   authority, and both sorts herein concurred.

   Rulers are either civil or ecclesiastical; both which (notwithstanding
   all their divisions) conspired in the death of Christ.

   As for civil rulers, as it was foretold, Ps. ii. 2, Ps. xxii. 12, so it
   was accomplished, Acts iv. 25, 26. The story is known of the
   concurrence of Herod and Pilate in the thing; -- the one, ruler of the
   place where he lived and conversed; the other, of the place where he
   was taken and crucified.

   As for ecclesiastical rulers, what was done by the priests and all the
   council of the elders is known; the matter of fact need not be insisted
   on. Indeed, they were the great contrivers and malicious plotters of
   his death, using all ways and means for the accomplishing of it, Acts
   iii. 17; in particular, Annas, the usurper of the priesthood, seems to
   have had a great hand in the business, and therefore to him was he
   first carried.

   As for those under authority, besides what we have in the story, Peter
   tells the body of the people, Acts ii. 23, that "they took him, and
   with wicked hands crucified and slew him;" and chap. iii. 15, that they
   "killed the Prince of life." So Zech. xii. 10, not only the "house of
   David," the rulers, but the "inhabitants of Jerusalem," the people, are
   said to "pierce him;" and thence "they which pierced him" is a
   periphrasis of the Jews. Rev. i. 7, after "Every eye shall see him,"
   there is a distribution into "They which pierced him," that is, the
   Jews, and "All kindreds of the earth," that is, the Gentiles. The very
   rabble were stirred up to cry, "Crucify him, crucify him," and did it
   accordingly, Matt. xxvii. 20; and they all consented as one man in the
   cry, verse 22, and that with violence and clamour, verse 23. Abjects
   made mouths at him, Ps. xxxv. 15, xxii. 7.

   (3dly.) Distinguish man in relation to himself, either upon a natural
   or moral account, as his kindred and relations, or strangers, and they
   will appear to be all engaged; but this is so comprised in the former
   distinction of Jews and Gentiles that it need not be insisted on.

   On a moral account, as they were either his friends or his enemies, he
   suffered from both.

   His friends, all his disciples, forsook him and fled, Matt. xxvi. 56.
   The worst of them betrayed him, verses 14, 15, and the best of them
   denied him, verse 70; and so "there was none to help," Ps. xxii. 11.

   And if it were thus with him in the house of his friends, what may be
   expected from his enemies? Their malice and conspiracy, their
   implacableness and cruelty, their plotting and accomplishment of their
   designs, take up so great a part of the history of his crucifying that
   I shall not need insist on particular instances.

   Yea, mankind was engaged as distinguished into sexes. Of men of all
   sorts you have heard already; and the tempting, ensnaring, captious
   question of the maid to Peter manifests that amongst his persecutors
   there were of that sex also, Matt. xxvi. 69.

   Of men's distinction by their employments, of soldiers, lawyers,
   citizens, divines, all concurring to this work, I shall not add any
   thing to what hath been spoken.

   Thus the first order of creatures, those that are intellectual, were
   universally, at least with a distributive universality, engaged in the
   suffering of the Lord Jesus; and the reason of this general engagement
   was, because the curse that was come upon them for sin had filled them
   all with enmity one against another:-- First, Fallen men and angels
   were engaged into an everlasting enmity on the first entrance of sin,
   Gen. iii. 15. Secondly, Men one towards another were filled with
   malice, and envy, and hatred, Tit. iii. 3.

   The Jews and Gentiles were engaged, by way of visible representation of
   the enmity which was come on all mankind, John iv. 9, Eph. ii. 14-17;
   and therefore he who was to undergo the whole curse of the law was to
   have the rage and fury of them all executed on him. As I said before,
   all their persecution of him concerned not his death as it was a
   sacrifice, as he made his soul an offering for sin; but as it was a
   punishment, the utmost of their enmity was to be executed towards him.

   The residue of the creatures concurred thus far to his sufferings as to
   manifest themselves at that time to be visibly under the curse and
   indignation that was upon him, and so withdrew themselves, as it were,
   from yielding him the least assistance. To instance in general, heaven
   and earth lost their glory, and that in them which is useful and
   comfortable to the children of men, without which all the other
   conveniencies and advantages are as a thing of naught. The glory of
   heaven is its light, Ps. xix. 1, 2; and the glory of the earth is its
   stability. He hath fixed the earth that it shall not be moved.

   Now, both these were lost at once. The heavens were darkened when it
   might be expected, in an ordinary course, that the sun should have
   shone in its full beauty, Matt. xxvii. 45, Luke xxiii. 44, 45; and the
   earth lost its stability, and shook or trembled, and the rocks rent,
   and the graves opened, Matt. xxvii. 51, 52; -- all evidences of that
   displeasure against sin which God was then putting in execution to the
   utmost, Rom. i. 18.

   Thus, first, in his suffering there was universality of efficient
   causes.

   (2.) There was a universality in respect of the subjects wherein he
   suffered. He suffered, -- [1.] In his person; [2.] In his name; [3.] In
   his friends; [4.] In his goods; as the curse of the law extended to
   all, and that universally in all these:--

   [1.] In his person or his human nature. In his person he suffered, in
   the two essential, constituent parts of it, his body and his soul:--
   1st. His body. In general, as to its integral parts, his body was
   "broken," 1 Cor. xi. 24, or crucified; his blood was "shed," Matt.
   xxvi. 28, or poured out. 2dly. His soul. His "soul was made an offering
   for sin," Isa. liii. 10; and his "soul was heavy unto death," Matt.
   xxvi. 37, 38.

   1st. In particular, his body suffered in all its concernments, --
   namely, all his senses and all its parts or members.

   In all its senses; as, to instance, --

   (1st.) In his feeling. He was full of pain, which made him, as he says,
   cry for disquietness; and this is comprised in every one of those
   expressions which say he was broken, pierced, and lived so long on the
   cross in the midst of most exquisite torture, until, being full of
   pain, he "cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost," Matt. xxvii.
   50.

   (2dly.) His tasting. When he fainted with loss of blood and grew
   thirsty, "they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall," Matt.
   xxvii. 34, John xix. 29, Matt. xxvii. 48, not to stupify his senses,
   but to increase his torment.

   (3dly.) His seeing, though not so much in the natural organ of it as in
   its use. He saw his mother and disciples standing by full of grief,
   sorrow, and confusion; which exceedingly increased his anguish and
   perplexity, John xix. 25, 26. And he saw his enemies full of rage and
   horror standing round about him, Ps. xxii. 12, 16. He saw them passing
   by and wagging the head in scorn, Matt. xxvii. 39, Ps. xxii. 7, 8.

   (4thly.) His ears were filled with the reproach and blasphemy of which
   he grievously complains, Ps. xxii. 7, 8; which also is expressed in its
   accomplishment, Matt. xxvii. 39-44, Luke xxiii. 36, 37. They reproached
   him with God, and his ministry, and his profession; as did also one of
   the thieves that were crucified with him. And, --

   (5thly.) They crucified him in a noisome place, a place of stink and
   loathsomeness, a place where they cast the dead bodies of men, from
   whose bones it got the name of "Golgotha," -- a place of dead men's
   skulls, Matt. xxvii. 33.

   He suffered in all the parts of his body, especially those which are
   most tender and full of sense:--

   (1st.) For his head, they platted a crown of thorns, and put it on him;
   and, to increase his pain, smote it on (that the thorns might pierce
   him the deeper) with their staves, Matt. xxvii. 29, 30, as the Jews had
   stricken him before, chap. xxvi. 67, 68, John xix. 2, 3.

   (2dly.) His face they spat upon, buffeted, smote, and plucked off his
   hair, Isa. l. 6, Matt. xxvi. 67, 68.

   (3dly.) His back was torn with whips and scourges, Matt. xxvii. 26,
   John xix. 1, emastigose there "they made long their furrows."

   (4thly.) His hands, and feet, and side, were pierced with nails and
   spear, Ps. xxii. 16.

   (5thly.) To express the residue of his body, and the condition of it
   when he hung on the cross so long, by the soreness of his hands and his
   feet, says he, "All my bones are out of joint," Ps. xxii. 14, and also
   verses 16, 17.

   Thus was it with his body.

   2dly. The like also is expressed of his soul; for, --

   (1st.) On his mind was darkness, -- not in it, but on it, -- as to his
   apprehension of the love and presence of God. Hence was his cry, "My
   God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Ps. xxii. 1, Matt. xxvii. 46.
   Though his faith was, upon the whole of the matter, prevalent and
   victorious, Isa. i. 7-9, yet he had many sore conflicts with the sense
   and apprehension of God's wrath for sin, and that desertion he was then
   under as to any cheering influences of his love and presence.

   (2dly.) For the rest of his faculties, he was not only under the
   pressure of the most perplexing, grievous, and burdensome passions that
   human nature is obnoxious unto, as, -- [1st.] Heaviness, "His soul was
   heavy unto death," Matt. xxvi. 37, 38; [2dly.] Grief, "[No sorrow like
   to his," Lam. i. 12; [3dly.] Fear, Heb. v. 7; -- but was also pressed
   into a condition beyond what we have words to express, or names of
   passions or affections to set it forth by. Hence he is said to be "in
   an agony," Luke xxii. 44; to be "amazed," Mark xiv. 33; with the like
   expressions, intimating a condition miserable and distressed beyond
   what we are able to comprehend or express.

   [2.] In his name, his repute, or credit, he suffered also. He was
   numbered amongst transgressors, Isa. liii. 12, Ps. xxii.; counted a
   malefactor, and crucified amongst them; a seducer, a blasphemer, a
   seditious person, a false prophet; and was cruelly mocked and derided
   on the cross as an impostor, that saved others but could not save
   himself, that pretended to be the Messiah, the King of Israel, but
   could not come down from the cross; laid in the balance with Barabbas,
   a rogue and a murderer, and rejected for him, Matt. xxvii..

   [3.] In his friends. The Shepherd was smitten, and the sheep scattered,
   Zech. xiii. 7, -- all his friends distressed, scattered, glad to flee
   for their lives, or to save themselves by doing the things that were
   worse than death.

   [4.] In his goods, even all that he had: "They parted his garments, and
   cast lots for his vesture," Ps. xxii. 18.

   Thus did he not in any thing go free, that the curse of the law in all
   things might be executed on him. The law curses a man in all his
   concernments, with the immission and infliction of every thing that is
   evil, and the subtraction of every thing that is good; that is, with
   "poena sensus et poena damni," as they are called.

   In reference to the law, I say that Christ underwent that very
   punishment that was threatened in the law and was due to sinners; the
   same that we should have undergone, had not our surety done it for us.
   To clear this briefly, observe that the punishment of the law may be
   considered two ways:--

   1. Absolutely in its own nature, as it lies in the law and the
   threatening thereof. This in general is called "death," Gen. ii. 17,
   Ezek. xviii. 4, Rom. v. 12; and by way of aggravation, because of its
   comprising the death of body and soul, "death unto death," 2 Cor. ii.
   16; and "the second death," Rev. xx. 14; and "the curse," Deut. xxvii.
   to xxix., Matt. xxv. 41; and "wrath," 1 Thess. i. 10 (hence we are said
   to be "delivered from the wrath to come"); and "wrath," or "the day of
   wrath," Rom. ii. 5, and in innumerable other places: all which are set
   out, in many metaphorical expressions, by those things which are to the
   nature of man most dreadful; as of "a lake with fire and brimstone," of
   "Tophet, whose pile is much wood," and the like.

   Of this punishment in general there are two parts:--

   (1.) Loss, or separation from God, expressed in these words, "Depart
   from me," Matt. vii. 23; "Depart, ye cursed," chap. xxv. 41; as also, 2
   Thess. i. 9.

   (2.) Sense or pain; whence it is called "fire," as 2 Thess. i. 8;
   "torments," etc., Luke xvi. 23. All this we say Christ underwent, as
   shall be farther manifested.

   2. Punishment of the law may be considered relatively to its subject,
   or the persons punished, and that in two regards:--

   (1.) In reference to its own attendancies and necessary consequents, as
   it falls upon the persons to be punished; and these are two:--

   [1.] That it be a "worm that dieth not," Mark ix. 44, Isa. lxvi. 24.

   [2.] That it be a "fire not to be quenched," -- that it be everlasting,
   that its torments be eternal.

   And both these, I say, attend and follow the punishment of the law, on
   the account of its relation to the persons punished, for, --

   1st. The worm is from the in-being and everlasting abiding of a man's
   own sin. That tormenting anguish of conscience which shall perplex the
   damned to eternity attends their punishment merely from their own sin
   inherent. This Christ could not undergo. The worm attends not sir,
   imputed, but sin inherent, especially not sin imputed to him who
   underwent it willingly, it being the cruciating vexation of men's own
   thoughts, kindled by the wrath of God against themselves about their
   own sin.

   2dly. That this worm never dies, that this fire can never be quenched,
   but abides for ever, is also from the relation of punishment to a
   finite creature that is no more. Eternity is not absolutely in the
   curse of the law, but as a finite creature is cursed thereby. If a
   sinner could at once admit upon himself that which is equal in divine
   justice to his offence, and so make satisfaction, there might be an end
   of his punishment in time; but a finite and every way limited creature,
   having sinned his eternity in this world against an eternal and
   infinite God, must abide by it for ever. This was Christ free from. The
   dignity of his person was such as that he could fully satisfy divine
   justice in a limited season; after which God in justice loosed the
   pains of death, for it was impossible he should be detained thereby,
   Acts ii. 24, and that because he was able to "swallow up death in
   victory."

   (2.) Punishment, as it relates to the persons punished, may be also
   considered in respect of the effects which it produceth in them which
   are not in the punishment absolutely considered; and these are
   generally two:--

   [1.] Repining against God and blaspheming of him, as in that type of
   hell, Isa. viii. 21, 22. This is evil or sin in itself, which
   punishment is not. It is from the righteous God, who will do no
   iniquity. This proceeds from men's hatred of God. They hate him in this
   world, when he doth them good and blesses them with many mercies; how
   much more will their hatred be increased when they shall be cut off
   from all favour or mercy whatever, and never enjoy one drop of
   refreshment from him! They hate him, his justice, yea, his blessedness,
   and all his perfections. Hence they murmur, repine, and blaspheme him.
   Now, this must needs be infinitely remote from him who, in love to his
   Father, and for his Father's glory, underwent this punishment. He was
   loved of the Father, and loved him, and willingly drank off this cup,
   which poisons the souls of sinners with wrath and revenge.

   [2.] Despair in themselves. Their hopes being cut off to eternity,
   there remaining no more sacrifice for sin, they are their own
   tormentors with everlastingly perplexing despair. But this our Saviour
   was most remote from, and that because he believed he should have a
   glorious issue of the trial he underwent, Heb. xii. 2, Isa. l. 7-9.

   But as to the punishment that is threatened in the law, in itself
   considered, Christ underwent the same that the law threatened, and
   which we should have undergone; for, --

   1. The law threatened death, Gen. ii. 17, Ezek. xviii. 4; and he tasted
   death for us, Heb. ii. 9, Ps. xxii. 15. The punishment of the law is
   the curse, Deut. xxvii.-xxix.; and he was made a curse, Gal. iii. 13.
   The law threatened loss of the love and the favour of God, and he lost
   it, Ps. xxii. 1.

   To say that the death threatened by the law was one, and that Christ
   underwent another, that eternal, this temperal, and so also of the
   curse and desertion threatened (besides what shall be said afterward),
   would render the whole business of our salvation unintelligible, as
   being revealed in terms equivocal, nowhere explained.

   2. There is not the least intimation in the whole book of God of any
   change of the punishment in reference to the Surety from what it was or
   should have been in respect of the sinner. God "made all our iniquities
   to meet on him;" that is, as hath been declared, the punishment due to
   them. Was it the same punishment, or another? Did we deserve one
   punishment, and Christ undergo another? Was it the sentence of the law
   that was executed on him, or was it some other thing that he was
   obnoxious to? It is said that he was "made under the law," Gal. iv. 4;
   that "sin was condemned in his flesh," Rom. viii. 3; that "God spared
   him not," verse 32; that he "tasted death," Heb. ii. 9; that he was
   "made a curse," Gal. iii. 13; -- all relating to the law. That he
   suffered more or less there is no mention.

   It is strange to me that we should deserve one punishment, and he who
   is punished for us should undergo another, yet both of them be
   constantly described by the same names and titles. If God laid the
   punishment of our sins on Christ, certainly it was the punishment that
   was due to them. Mention is everywhere made of a commutation of
   persons, the just suffering for the unjust, the sponsor for the
   offender, his name as a surety being taken into the obligation, and the
   whole debt required, of him; but of a change of punishment there is no
   mention at all. And there is this desperate consequence, that will be
   made readily, upon a supposal that any thing less than the curse of the
   law or death, in the nature of it eternal, was inflicted on Christ, --
   namely, that God indeed is not such a sore revenger of sin as in the
   Scripture he is proposed to be, but can pass it by in the way of
   composition on much easier terms.

   3. The punishment due to us, that is in the "curse of the law,"
   consists, as was said, of two parts:-- (1.) Loss, or separation from
   God; (2.) Sense, from the infliction of the evil threatened. And both
   these did our Saviour undergo.

   (1.) For the first, it is expressed of him, Ps. xxii. 1; and he
   actually complains of it himself, Matt. xxvii. 46: and of this cry for
   a while he says, "O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest
   not," Ps. xxii. 2, until he gives out that grievous complaint, verse
   15, "My strength is dried up like a potsherd;" which cry he pressed so
   long with strong cries and supplications, until he was heard and
   delivered from what he feared, Heb. v. 7. They who would invent
   evasions for this express complaint of our Saviour that he was deserted
   and forsaken, as that he spake it in reference to his church, or of his
   own being left to the power and malice of the Jews, do indeed little
   less than blaspheme him, and say he was not forsaken of God, when
   himself complains that he was; -- forsaken, I say, not by the
   disjunction of his personal union, but as to the communication of
   effects of love and favour; which is the desertion that the damned lie
   under in hell. And as for his being forsaken or given up to the hands
   of men, was that it which he complained of? was that it whereof he was
   afraid, which he was troubled at, which he sweat blood under the
   consideration of, and had need of an angel to comfort and support him?
   Was he so much in courage and resolution below those many thousands who
   joyfully suffered the same things for him? If he was only forsaken to
   the power of the Jews, it must be so. Let men take heed how they give
   occasion of blaspheming the holy and blessed name of the Son of God.

   Vaninus, that great atheist, who was burned for atheism at Toulouse in
   France, all the way as he went to the stake did nothing but insult over
   the friars that attended him, telling them that their Saviour when he
   was led to death did sweat and tremble, and was in an agony; but that
   he, upon the account of reason, whereunto he sacrificed his life, went
   with boldness and cheerfulness. God visibly confuted his blasphemy, and
   at the stake he not only trembled and quaked, but roared with horror.
   [489] But let men take heed how they justify the atheistical thoughts
   of men, in asserting our blessed Redeemer to have been cast into that
   miserable and deplorable condition merely with the consideration of a
   temporary death, which perhaps the thieves that were crucified with him
   did not so much tremble at.

   (2.) For "poena sensus." From what hath been spoken, it is sufficiently
   manifest what he underwent on this account. To what hath been delivered
   before, of his being "bruised, afflicted, broken of God," from Isa.
   liii. -- although he was "taken from prison and from judgment," verse
   8, or everlasting condemnation, -- add but this one consideration of
   what is affirmed of him, that "he tasted death for us," Heb. ii. 9, and
   this will be cleared. What death was it he tasted? The death that had
   the curse attending it: Gal. iii. 13, "He was made a curse." And what
   death that was himself declares, Matt. xxv. 41, where, calling men
   accursed, he cries, "Depart into everlasting fire;" -- "Ye that are
   obnoxious to the law, go to the punishment of hell." Yea, and that
   curse which he underwent, Gal. iii. 13, is opposed to the blessing of
   Abraham, verse 14, or the blessing promised him; which was doubtless
   life eternal.

   And to make it yet more clear, it was By death that he delivered us
   from death, Heb. ii. 14, 15; and if he died only a temporal death, he
   delivered us only from temporal death as a punishment. But he shows us
   what death he delivered us from, and consequently what death he
   underwent for us, John viii. 51, "He shall never see death;" that is,
   eternal death, for every believer shall see death temporal.

   On these considerations, it is evident that the sufferings of Christ in
   relation to the law were the very same that were threatened to sinners,
   and which we should have undergone had not our Surety undertaken the
   work for us. Neither was there any difference in reference to God the
   judge and the sentence of the law, but only this, that the same persons
   who offended did not suffer, and that those consequences of the
   punishment inflicted which attend the offenders' own suffering could
   have no place in him. But this being not the main of my present design,
   I shall not farther insist on it.

   Only I marvel that any should think to implead this truth of Christ's
   suffering the same that we did, by saying that Christ's obligation to
   punishment was "sponsionis propriæ," ours "violatæ legis;" as though it
   were the manner how Christ came to be obnoxious to punishment, and not
   what punishment he underwent, that is asserted when we say that he
   underwent the same that, we should have done. But as to say that Christ
   became obnoxious to punishment the same way that we do or did, that is,
   by sin of his own, is blasphemy; so to say he did not, upon his own
   voluntary undertaking, undergo the same is little less. It is true,
   Christ was made sin for us, -- had our sin imputed to him, not his own,
   was obliged to answer for our fault, not his own; but he was obliged to
   answer what we should have done. But hereof elsewhere.

Chapter XXVII.

   Of the covenant between the Father and the Son, the ground and
   foundation of this dispensation of Christ's being punished for us and
   in our stead.

   The fourth thing considerable is the ground of this dispensation of
   Christ's being punished for us, which also hath influence into his
   whole mediation on our behalf. This is that compact, covenant,
   convention, or agreement, that was between the Father and the Son, for
   the accomplishment of the work of our redemption by the mediation of
   Christ, to the praise of the glorious grace of God.

   The will of the Father appointing and designing the Son to be the head,
   husband, deliverer, and redeemer of his elect, his church, his people,
   whom he did foreknow, with the will of the Son voluntarily, freely
   undertaking that work and all that was required thereunto, is that
   compact (for in that form it is proposed in the Scripture) that we
   treat of.

   It being so proposed, so we call it, though there be difficulty in its
   explication. Rabbi Ruben, in Galatinus, says of Isa. lxvi. 16, that if
   the Scripture had not said it, it had not been lawful to have said it,
   but being written, it may be spoken, "In fire, or by fire, is the Lord
   judged:" for it is not svpht?, that is, "judging;" but nspt?, that is,
   "is judged;" [490] -- which by some is applied to Christ and the fire
   he underwent in his suffering. However, the rule is safe, That which is
   written may be spoken, for for that end was it written, God in his word
   teaching us how we should speak of him. So it is in this matter.

   It is true, the will of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is but
   one. It is a natural property, and where there is but one nature there
   is but one will: but in respect of their distinct personal actings,
   this will is appropriated to them respectively, so that the will of the
   Father and the will of the Son may be considered [distinctly] in this
   business; which though essentially one and the same, yet in their
   distinct personality it is distinctly considered, as the will of the
   Father and the will of the Son. Notwithstanding the unity of essence
   that is between the Father and the Son, yet is the work distinctly
   carried on by them; so that the same God judges and becomes surety,
   satisfieth and is satisfied, in these distinct persons.

   Thus, though this covenant be eternal, and the object of it be that
   which might not have been, and so it hath the nature of the residue of
   God's decrees in these regards, yet because of this distinct acting of
   the will of the Father and the will of the Son with regard to each
   other, it is more than a decree, and hath the proper nature of a
   covenant or compact. Hence, from the moment of it (I speak not of
   time), there is a new habitude of will in the Father and Son towards
   each other that is not in them essentially; I call it new, as being in
   God freely, not naturally. And hence was the salvation of men before
   the incarnation, by the undertaking, mediation, and death of Christ.
   That the saints under the old testament were saved by Christ at present
   I take for granted; that they were saved by virtue of a mere decree
   will not be said. From hence was Christ esteemed to be incarnate and to
   have suffered, or the fruits of his incarnation and suffering could not
   have been imputed to any; for the thing itself being denied, the
   effects of it are not.

   The revelation of this covenant is in the Scripture; not that it was
   then constituted when it is first mentioned in the promises and
   prophecies of Christ, but [it was] then first declared or revealed.
   Christ was declared to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the
   dead, but he was so from eternity. As in other places, as shall be
   evinced, so in Isa. liii. is this covenant mentioned: in which chapter
   there is this prophetical scheme, -- The covenant between Father and
   Son, which was past, is spoken of as to come; and the sufferings of
   Christ, which were to come, are spoken of as past; as appears to every
   one that but reads the chapter. It is also signally ascribed to
   Christ's coming into the world; not constitutively, but declaratively.
   It is the greatest folly about such things as these, to suppose them
   then done when revealed, though revealed in expressions of doing them.
   These things being premised, I proceed to manifest how this covenant is
   in the Scripture declared.

   Now, this convention or agreement, as elsewhere, so it is most clearly
   expressed Heb. x. 7, from Ps. xl. 7, 8, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O
   God." And what will? Verse 10, "The will by which we are sanctified,
   through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." The
   will of God was that Jesus should be offered; and to this end, that we
   might be sanctified and saved. It is called "The offering of the body
   of Jesus Christ," in answer to what was said before, "A body hast thou
   prepared me," or a human nature, by a synecdoche. "My will," says God
   the Father, "is, that thou have a body, and that that body be offered
   up; and that to this end, that the children, the elect, might be
   sanctified." Says the Son to this, "Lo, I come to do thy will;" -- "I
   accept of the condition, and give up myself to the performance of thy
   will."

   To make this more distinctly evident, the nature of such a compact,
   agreement, or convention, as depends on personal service, such as this,
   may be a little considered.

   There are five things required to the complete establishing and
   accomplishing of such a compact or agreement:--

   1. That there be sundry persons, two at least, namely, a promiser and
   undertaker, agreeing voluntarily together in counsel and design for the
   accomplishment and bringing about some common end acceptable to them
   both; so agreeing together. [491] Being both to do somewhat that they
   are not otherwise obliged to do, there must be some common end agreed
   on by them wherein they are delighted; and if they do not both
   voluntarily agree to what is on each hand incumbent to do, it is no
   covenant or compact, but an imposition of one upon the other.

   2. That the person promising, who is the principal engager in the
   covenant, do require something at the hand of the other, to be done or
   undergone, wherein he is concerned. He is to prescribe something to
   him, which is the condition whereon the accomplishment of the end aimed
   at is to depend.

   3. That he make to him who doth undertake such promises as are
   necessary for his supportment and encouragement, and which may fully
   balance, in his judgment and esteem, all that is required of him or
   prescribed to him.

   4. That upon the weighing and consideration of the condition and
   promise, the duty and reward prescribed and engaged for, as formerly
   mentioned, the undertaker do voluntarily address himself to the one,
   and expect the accomplishment of the other.

   5. That, the accomplishment of the condition being pleaded by the
   undertaker and approved by the promiser, [492] the common end
   originally designed be brought about and established.

   These five things are required to the entering into and complete
   accomplishment of such a covenant, convention, or agreement as is built
   on personal performances; and they are all eminently expressed in the
   Scripture, and to be found in the compact between the Father and the
   Son whereof we speak, as upon the consideration of the severals will
   appear.

   On the account of these things, found at least virtually and
   effectually in this agreement of the Father and Son, we call it a
   covenant; not with respect to the Latin word "foedus," and the precise
   use of it, but to the Hebrew vryt?, and the Greek diatheke, whose
   signification and use alone are to be attended to in the business of
   any covenant of God; and in what a large sense they are used is known
   to all that understand them and have made inquiry into their import.
   The rise of the word "foedus" is properly paganish and superstitious;
   and the legal use of it strict to a mutual engagement upon valuable
   considerations, The form of its entrance, by the sacrifice and killing
   of a hog, is related in Polybius, Livius, Virgil, and others. The
   general words used in it were, "Ita foede me percutiat magnus Jupiter,
   ut foede hunt porcum macto, ai pactum foederis non servavero;" [493]
   whence is that phrase of one in danger, "Sto inter sacrum et saxum,"
   the hog being killed with a stone. So "foedus" is "a feriendo:" though
   sometimes even that word be used, in a very large sense, for any
   orderly-disposed government; as in the poet:--


   ? "Regemque dedit, qui foedere certo

   Et premere, et laxas sciret dare jussus habenas," etc.

   Virg. Æn. i. 66.

   But unto the signification and laws hereof, in this business, we are
   not bound. It sufficeth for our present intendment that the things
   mentioned be found virtually in this compact, which they are.

   1. There are the Father and the Son as distinct persons agreeing
   together in counsel for the accomplishment of the common end, -- the
   glory of God and the salvation of the elect. The end is expressed, Heb.
   ii. 9, 10, xii. 2. Now, thus it was, Zech. vi. 13, "The counsel of
   peace shall be between them both," -- "Inter ambos ipsos." [494] That
   is, the two persons spoken of, not the two offices there intimated,
   that shall meet in Christ. And who are these? The Lord Jehovah, who
   speaks, and the man whose name is mch?, "The Branch," verse 12, who is
   to do all the great things there mentioned: "He shall grow up," etc.
   But the counsel of peace, the design of our peace, is between them
   both; they have agreed and consented to the bringing about of our
   peace. Hence is that name of the Son of God, Isa. ix. 6, "Wonderful
   Counsellor." It is in reference to the business there spoken of that he
   is so called. This is expressed at the beginning of the verse, "Unto us
   a child is born, unto us a son is given." To what end that was is
   known, namely, that he might be a Saviour or a Redeemer, whence he is
   afterward called "The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace;" that
   is, a father to his church and people in everlasting mercy, the grand
   author of their peace, that procured it for them and established it
   unto them. Now, as to this work, that he who is 'l gbvr?, "The mighty
   God," might be bn nchn?, "A son given, a child born," and carry on a
   work of mercy and peace towards his church, is he called "The wonderful
   Counsellor," as concurring in the counsel and design of his Father, and
   with him, to this end and purpose. Therefore, when he comes to suffer
   in the carrying on of this work, God calls him his "fellow," mychy?,
   "my neighbour" in counsel and advice, Zech. xiii. 7; as David describes
   his fellow or companion, Ps. lv. 14, "We took sweet counsel together."
   He was the fellow of the Lord of hosts on this account, that they took
   counsel together about the work of our salvation, to the glory of God.
   Prov. viii. 22-31 makes this evident. That it is the Lord Jesus Christ,
   the eternal Word and Wisdom of the Father, who is here intended, was
   before evinced. What, then, is here said of him? "I was daily the
   delight of God, rejoicing always before him, rejoicing in the habitable
   part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men." When was
   this that the Wisdom of God the Father did so rejoice before him on the
   account of the sons of men? Verses 24-26, "When there were no depths,
   when there were no fountains abounding with water, before the mountains
   were settled," etc., "while as yet he had not made the earth," etc. But
   how could this be? namely, by the counsel of peace that was between
   them both, which is the delight of the soul of God, and wherein both
   Father and Son rejoice.

   The first thing, then, is manifest, that there was a voluntary
   concurrence and distinct consent of the Father and Son for the
   accomplishment of the work of our peace, and for bringing us to God.

   2. For the accomplishment of this work, the Father, who is principal in
   the covenant, the promiser, whose love "sets all on work," as is
   frequently expressed in the Scripture, requires of the Lord Jesus
   Christ, his Son, that he shall do that which, upon consideration of his
   justice, glory, and honour, was necessary to be done for the bringing
   about the end proposed, prescribing to him a law for the performance
   thereof; which is called his "will" so often in Scripture.

   What it was that was required is expressed both negatively and
   positively:--

   (1.) Negatively, that he should not do or bring about this work by any
   of those sacrifices that had been appointed to make atonement "suo
   more," and to typify out what was by him really to be performed. This
   the Lord Jesus professeth at the entrance of his work, when he
   addresses himself to the doing of that which was indeed required:
   "Sacrifice and offering," etc., "thou wouldest not." He was not to
   offer any of the sacrifices that had been offered before, as at large
   hath been recounted. It was the will of God that, by them, he and what
   he was to do should be shadowed out and represented; whereupon, at his
   coming to his work, they were all to be abrogated. Nor was he to bring
   silver and gold for our redemption, according to the contrivance of the
   poor convinced sinner, Mic. vi. 6, 7; but he was to tender God another
   manner of price, 1 Pet. i. 18.

   He was to do that which the old sacrifices could not do, as hath been
   declared: "For it was not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
   should take away sins," Heb. x. 4. Aphairein hamartias, quod supra
   athetein et anaphherein, est extinguere peccata, sire facere ne ultra
   peccetur; id sanguis Christi facit, tum quia fidem in nobis parit, tum
   quia Christo jus dat nobis auxilia necesaria impetrandi," Grot. in loc.
   Falsely and injuriously to the blood of Christ! Aphairein hamartias is
   nowhere in the Scripture to cause men to "cease to sin;" it never
   respects properly what is to come, but what is past. The apostle treats
   not of sanctification, but of justification. The taking away of sins he
   insists on is such as that the sinner should no more be troubled in
   conscience for the guilt of them, verse 2. The typical taking away of
   sins by sacrifices was by making atonement with God principally, not by
   turning men from sin, which yet was a consequent of them. The blood of
   Christ takes away sins as to their guilt by justification, and not only
   as to their filth by sanctification. This purification also by blood he
   expounds in his Annotations, chap. ix. 14: "Sanguini autem purgatio
   ista tribuitur, quia per sanguinem, id est, mortem Christi, secuta ejus
   excitatione et evectione, giguitur in nobis tides, Rom. iii. 25, quæ
   deinde fides corda purgat, Acts xv. 9." The meaning of these words is
   evident to all that have their senses exercised in these things. The
   eversion of the expiation of our sins by the way of satisfaction and
   atonement is that which is aimed at. Now, because the annotator saw
   that the comparison insisted on with the sacrifices of old would not
   admit of this gloss, he adds, "Similitudo autem purgationis legalis, et
   evangelicæ, non est in modo purgandi sed in effectu;" than which
   nothing is more false, nor more directly contrary to the apostle's
   discourse, Heb. ix. 10.

   (2.) Positively. And here, to lay aside the manner how he was to do it,
   which relates to his office of priest, and prophet, and king, the
   conditions imposed upon him may be referred to three heads:--

   [1.] That he should take on him the nature of those whom he was to
   bring to God. This is as it were prescribed to him, Heb. x. 5, "A body
   hast thou prepared me," or "appointed that I should be made flesh, --
   take a body therein to do thy will." And the apostle sets out the
   infinite love of the Son of God, in that he condescended to this
   inexpressible exinanition and eclipsing of his glory, Phil. ii. 6, 7,
   "Being in the form of God, and equal with God, he made himself of no
   reputation, but took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in
   the likeness of men," or made a roam He did it upon his Father's
   prescription, and in pursuit of what God required at his hands. Hence
   it is said, "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman," Gal. iv. 4; and
   "God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh," Rom. viii. 3.
   And properly in answer to this of the Father's appointing him a body is
   it that the Son answers, "Lo, I come to do thy will," -- "I will do it,
   I will undertake it, that the great desirable end may be brought
   about," as we shall see afterward. So Heb. x. 9. And though I see no
   sufficient reason of relinquishing the usual interpretation of
   spermatos Abraam epilambanetai, Heb. ii. 16, yet if it be
   "apprehendit," and expressive of the effect, not "assumpsit," relating
   to the way of his yielding us assistance and deliverance, the same
   thing is intimated.

   [2.] That in this "body," or human nature, he should be a "servant," or
   yield obedience. Hence God calls him his servant, Isa. xlii. 1, "Behold
   my servant, whom I uphold." And that this was also the condition
   prescribed to him our Saviour acknowledges, Isa. xlix. 5, "Now, saith
   the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant," etc. And in
   pursuit hereof, Christ takes upon him "the form of a servant," Phil.
   ii. 7: and this is his perpetual profession, "I came to do the will of
   him that sent me;" and, "This commandment I have received of my
   Father." So, "though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience." All
   along, in the carrying on of his work, he professes that this condition
   was by his Father prescribed him, that he should be his servant, and
   yield him obedience in the work he had in hand. Hence he says his
   Father is greater than he, John xiv. 28, not only in respect of his
   humiliation, but also in respect of the dispensation whereunto he, as
   the Son of God, submitted himself, to perform his Will and yield him
   obedience. And this God declares to be the condition whereon he will
   deliver man: Job xxxiii. 23, 24, "If there be a messenger (a servant),
   one of a thousand, to undertake for him, it shall be so, I will say,
   Deliver man; otherwise not." [495]

   [3.] That he should suffer and undergo what in justice is due to him
   that he was to deliver; -- a hard and great prescription, yet such as
   must be undergone, that there may be a consistence of the justice and
   truth of God with the salvation of man. This is plainly expressed, Isa.
   liii. 10, 'mtsym 'sm nphsv?, "When thou shalt make his soul an offering
   for sin," or rather, "If his soul shall make an offering for sin, then
   he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of
   the Lord shall prosper in his hand." As if he should say, "If this work
   be brought about, and if the counsel of peace which we have consented
   in be carried on, if my pleasure therein be to prosper, thou must make
   thy soul an offering for sin." And that this was required of our
   Saviour, himself fully expresses even in his agony, when, praying for
   the removal of the cup, he submits to the drinking of it in these
   words: "?Thy will, O Father, be done;' this is that which thou wilt
   have me do, which thou hast prescribed unto me, even that I drink of
   this cup;" wherein he "tasted of death," and which comprised the whole
   of his sufferings. And this is the third thing in this convention and
   agreement.

   3. Promises are made, upon the supposition of undertaking that which
   was required, and these of all sorts that might either concern the
   person that did undertake, or the accomplishment of the work that he
   did undertake.

   (1.) For the person himself that was to undertake, or the Lord Jesus
   Christ, seeing there was much difficulty and great opposition to be
   passed through in what he was to do and undergo, promises of the
   assistance of his Father, by his presence with him, and carrying him
   through all perplexities and trials, are given to him in abundance.
   Some of these you have, Isa. xlii. 4, "He shall not fail nor be
   discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth;" and verse 6, "I
   the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and
   will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people;" --
   "Whatever opposition thou mayst meet withal, I will hold thee, and keep
   thee, and preserve thee." "I will not leave thy soul in hell, nor
   suffer mine Holy One to see corruption," Ps. xvi. 10. So Ps. lxxxix.
   28, "My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall
   stand fast with him." And hence was our blessed Saviour's confidence in
   his greatest trial, Isa. l. 5-9. Verses 5, 6, our Saviour expresses his
   undertaking, and what he suffered therein; verses 7-9, the assistance
   that he was promised of his Father in this great trial, on the account
   whereof he despises all his enemies, with full assurance of success,
   even upon the Father's engaged promise of his presence with him. This
   is the first sort of promises made to Christ in this convention, which
   concern himself directly, that he should not be forsaken in his work,
   but carried through, supported and upheld, until he were come forth to
   full success, and had "sent forth judgment unto victory." Hence, in his
   greatest trial, he makes his address to God himself, on the account of
   these promises, to be delivered from that which he feared: Heb. v. 7,
   "Who in the days," etc. So Ps. lxxxix. 27, 28.

   (2.) There were promises in this compact that concerned the work itself
   that Christ undertook, namely, that if he did what was required of him,
   not only he should be preserved in it, but also that the work itself
   should thrive and prosper in his hand. So Isa. liii. 10, 11, "When thou
   shalt make," etc. Whatever he aimed at is here promised to be
   accomplished. "The pleasure of the Lord shall prosper;" -- the design
   of Father and Son for the accomplishment of our salvation shall
   prosper. "He shall see his seed," -- a seed of believers shall be
   raised up, that shall "prolong their days;" that is, the seed shall
   prolong or continue whilst the sun and moon endure; all the elect shall
   be justified and saved. Satan shall be conquered, and the spoil
   delivered from him. And this our Saviour comforts himself withal in his
   greatest distress, Ps. xxii. 30, 31. And for this "joy that was set
   before him," the joy of "bringing many sons unto glory" that was
   promised to him, "he endured the cross, and despised the shame," Heb.
   xii. 2. So also Isa. xliii. 1-4.

   And this is the third thing in this compact, He who prescribes the hard
   conditions of incarnation, obedience, and death, doth also make the
   glorious promises of preservation, protection, and success. And to make
   these promises the more eminent, God confirms them solemnly by an oath.
   He is consecrated a high priest for evermore by the "word of the oath,"
   Heb. vii. 28. "The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest
   for ever," etc., verse 21.

   4. The Lord Jesus Christ accepts of the condition, and the promise, and
   voluntarily undertakes the work: Ps. xl. 7, 8, "Then said I, Lo, I
   come: I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
   heart." He freely, willingly, cheerfully, undertakes to do and suffer
   whatever it was the will of his Father that he should do or suffer for
   the bringing about the common end aimed at. He undertakes to be the
   Father's servant in this work, and says to the Lord, "Thou art my
   Lord," Ps. xvi. 2; -- "Thou art he to whom I am to yield obedience, to
   submit to in this work" "Mine ears hast thou bored, and I am thy
   servant;" -- "I am not rebellious, I do not withdraw from it," Isa. i.
   5. Hence the apostle tells us that this mind was in him, that whereas
   he was "in the form of God, he humbled himself to the death of the
   cross," Phil. ii. 6-8. And so, by his own voluntary consent, he came
   under the law of the mediator; which afterward, as he would not, so he
   could not decline. He made himself surety of the covenant, and so was
   to pay what he never took. He voluntarily engaged himself into this
   sponsion; but when he had so done, he was legally subject to all that
   attended it, -- when he had put his name into the obligation, he became
   responsible for the whole debt. And all that he did or suffered comes
   to be called "obedience;" which relates to the law that he was subject
   to, having engaged himself to his Father, and said to the Lord, "Thou
   art my Lord; lo, I come to do thy will."

   5. The fifth and last thing is, that on the one side the promiser do
   approve and accept of the performance of the condition prescribed, and
   the undertaker demand and lay claim to the promises made, and thereupon
   the common end designed be accomplished and fulfilled. All this also is
   fully manifest in this compact or convention.

   (1.) God the Father accepts of the performance of what was to the Son
   prescribed. This God fully declares, Isa. xlix. 5, 6, "And now, saith
   the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob
   again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in
   the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength. And he said, It
   is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the
   tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also
   give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation
   unto the end of the earth." And eminently, verses 8, 9," Thus saith the
   Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of
   salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee
   for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to
   inherit the desolate heritages; that thou mayest say to the prisoners,
   Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves," etc.; --
   "Now, I have been with thee, and helped thee in thy work, and thou hast
   performed it; now thou shalt do all that thy heart desires, according
   to my promise." Hence that which was originally spoken of the eternal
   generation of the Son, Ps. ii. 7, "Thou art my Son, this day have I
   begotten thee," is applied by the apostle to his resurrection from the
   dead: Acts xiii. 33, "God hath fulfilled his word unto us, in that he
   hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm,
   Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee." That is, God by the
   resurrection from the dead gloriously manifested him to be his Son,
   whom he loved, in whom he was well pleased, and who did all his
   pleasure. So Rom. i. 4, "He was declared to be the Son of God with
   power, by the resurrection from the dead." Then was he declared to be
   the Son of God. God, approving and accepting the work he had done,
   loosed the pains of death, and raised him again, manifesting to all the
   world his approbation and acceptation of him and his work; whence he
   immediately says to him, Ps. ii. 8, "Ask of me, and I shall give thee
   the heathen for thine inheritance;" -- "Now ask what thou wilt,
   whatever I have promised, whatever thou didst or couldst expect upon
   thy undertaking this work; it shall be done, it shall be granted thee."
   And, --

   (2.) Christ, accordingly, makes his demand solemnly on earth and in
   heaven. On earth: John xvii., throughout the whole chapter is the
   demand of Christ for the accomplishment of the whole compact and all
   the promises that were made to him when he undertook to be a Saviour,
   which concerned both himself and his church; see verses 1, 4-6, 9,
   12-16, etc. And in heaven also: he is gone into "the presence of God,"
   there "to appear for us," Heb. ix. 24, and is "able to save them to the
   uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
   intercession for them," chap. vii. 25; not as in the days of his flesh,
   with strong cries and supplications, but by virtue of his oblation,
   laying claim to the promised inheritance in our behalf. And, --

   (3.) The whole work is accomplished, and the end intended brought
   about: for in the death of Christ he "finished the transgression, and
   made an end of sins, and made reconciliation for iniquity, and brought
   in everlasting righteousness," Dan. ix. 24; and of sinful man God says,
   "Deliver him, for I have found a ransom," Job xxxiii. 24. Hence our
   reconciliation, justification, yea, our salvation, are in the Scripture
   spoken of as things actually done and accomplished in the death and
   blood-shedding of Jesus Christ. Not as though we were all then actually
   justified and saved, but upon the account of the certainty of the
   performance and accomplishment of those things in their due time
   towards us and upon us are these things so delivered: for in reference
   to the undertaking of Christ in this covenant is he called "The second
   Adam," becoming a common head to his people (with this difference, that
   Adam was a common head to all that came of him necessarily, and, as I
   may so say, naturally, and whether he would or no; Christ is so to his
   voluntarily, and by his own consent and undertaking, as hath been
   demonstrated); now, as we all die in Adam federally and meritoriously,
   yet the several individuals are not in their persons actually dead in
   sin and obnoxious to eternal death before they are by natural
   generation united to Adam, their first head; so, though all the elect
   be made alive and saved federally and meritoriously in the death of
   Christ, wherein also a certain foundation is laid of that efficacy
   which works all these things in us and for us, yet we are not viritim
   made partakers of the good things mentioned before we are united to
   Christ by the communication of his Spirit to us.

   And this, I say, is the covenant and compact that was between Father
   and Son, which is the great foundation of what hath been said and shall
   farther be spoken about the merit and satisfaction of Christ. Here lies
   the ground of the righteousness of the dispensation treated of, that
   Christ should undergo the punishment due to us: It was done
   voluntarily, of himself, and he did nothing but what he had power to
   do, and command from his Father to do. "I have power," saith he, "to
   lay down my life, and I have power to take it again; this commandment
   have I received of my Father;" whereby the glory both of the love and
   justice of God is exceedingly exalted. And, --

   1. This stops the mouth of the Socinian clamour concerning the
   unrighteousness of one man's suffering personally for another man's
   sin. It is true, it is so if these men be not in such relation to one
   another that what one doth or suffereth, the other may be accounted to
   do or suffer; but it is no unrighteousness, if the hand offend, that
   the head be smitten. But Christ is our head; we are his members. It is
   true, if he that suffereth hath not power over that wherein he suffers;
   but Christ had power to lay down his life and take it again. It is
   true, if he that is to suffer and he that is to punish be not willing
   or agreed to the commutation; but here Father and Son, as hath been
   manifested, were fully agreed upon the whole matter. It may be true, if
   he who suffers cannot possibly be made partaker of any good afterward
   that shall balance and overweigh all his suffering; not where the cross
   is endured and the shame despised for the glory proposed or set before
   him that suffers, -- not where he is made low for a season, that he may
   be crowned with dignity and honour. And, --

   2. This is the foundation of the merit of Christ. The apostle tells us,
   Rom. iv. 4, what merit is: it is such an adjunct of obedience as
   whereby "the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt." God having
   proposed unto Christ a law for obedience, with promises of such and
   such rewards upon condition of fulfilling the obedience required, he
   performing that obedience, the reward is reckoned to him of debt, or he
   righteously merited whatever was so promised to him. Though the compact
   was of grace, yet the reward is of debt. Look, then, whatever God
   promised Christ upon his undertaking to be a Saviour, that, upon the
   fulfilling of his will, he merited. That himself should be exalted,
   that he should be the head of his church, that he should see his seed,
   that he should justify and save them, sanctify and glorify them, were
   all promised to him, all merited by him. But of this more afterward.

   Having thus fully considered the threefold notion of the death of
   Christ, as it was a price, a sacrifice, and a punishment, and
   discovered the foundation of righteousness in all this, proceed we now
   to manifest what are the proper effects of the death of Christ under
   this threefold notion. Now these also, answerably, are three:-- I.
   Redemption, as it is a price; II. Reconciliation, as it is a sacrifice;
   III. Satisfaction, as it is a punishment. Upon which foundation, union
   with Christ, vocation, justification, sanctification, and glory, are
   built.

Chapter XXVIII.

   Of redemption by the death of Christ as it was a price or ransom.

   Having given before the general notions of the death of Christ, as it
   is in Scripture proposed, all tending to manifest the way and manner of
   the expiation of our sins, and our delivery from the guilt and
   punishment due to them, it remains that an accommodation of those
   several notions of it be made particularly and respectively to the
   business in hand.

   I. The first consideration proposed of the death of Christ was of it as
   a price; and the issue and effect thereof is redemption. Hence Christ
   is spoken of in the Old Testament as a Redeemer: Job xix. 25 "I know
   that my Redeemer liveth." The word there used is gv'l?, whose rise and
   use is commonly known.

   g'l? is "vindicare, redimere;" epilambanesthai, in Greek; which is
   commonly used for "suum vindicare:" Hoti an tis ektemenos he, ... kai
   medeis epilabetai ean houto tis eniauton hotioun ektemenos ... me
   exesto toioutou ktematos epilabesthai meden apelthontos eniautou. Plato
   de Legib. 12. And that may be the sense of the word epilambanetai, if
   not in the effect, yet in the cause, Heb. ii. 16.

   The rise and use of this word in this business of our deliverance by
   Christ we have Lev. xxv. 25, "If any of his kin come to redeem it."
   g'lv hqrv?, -- "redimens illud propinquus." The next who is g'l? [is
   to] redeem it, or vindicate the possession out of mortgage. On this
   account Boaz tells Ruth that, in respect of the possession of
   Elimelech, he was goël, Ruth iii. 13, a redeemer; which we have
   translated "a kinsman," because he was to do that office by right of
   propinquity of blood or nearness of kin, as is evident from the law
   before mentioned. Christ, coming to vindicate us into liberty by his
   own blood, is called by Job his goël, chap. xix. 25; so also is he
   termed, Isa. xli. 14, g'lk?, "thy redeemer," or "thy next kinsman;" and
   chap. xliv. 6, in that excellent description of Christ, also verse 24,
   xlvii. 4, xlviii. 17, xlix. 26, liv. 5, lix. 20, lx. 16, lxiii. 16, and
   in sundry other places. Neither is the church of God at all beholding
   to some late expositors, who, to show their skill in the Hebrew
   doctors, would impose upon us their interpretations, and make those
   expressions to signify deliverance in general, and to be referred to
   God the Father, seeing that the rise of the use of the word plainly
   restrains the redemption intended to the paying of a price for it;
   which was done only by Jesus Christ. So Jer. xxxii. 7, 8. Hence they
   that looked for the Messiah, according to the promise, are said to look
   for, or to wait for, lutrosin, "redemption in Israel," Luke ii. 38:
   and, in the accomplishment of the promise, the apostle tells us that
   Christ by his blood obtained for us "eternal redemption," Heb. ix. 12.
   And he having so obtained it, we are "justified freely by the grace of
   God, dia tes apolutroseos tes en Christo Iesou, -- by the redemption
   that is in Christ Jesus;" en phor dia, "in him," for "by him," or
   wrought by him, Rom. iii. 24. And this being brought home to us, "we
   have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins," Eph. i. 7,
   Col. i. 14; whence he is said to be "made unto us apolutrosis," or
   "redemption," 1 Cor. i. 30.

   How this is done will be made evident by applying of what is now spoken
   to what was spoken of the death of Christ as a price. Christ giving
   himself or his life lutron and antilutron, a price of redemption, as
   hath been showed, a ransom, those for whom he did it come to have
   lutrosin, and apolutrosin, redemption thereby, or deliverance from the
   captivity wherein they were. And our Saviour expresses particularly how
   this was done as to both parts, Matt. xx. 28. He came dounai ten
   psuchen lutron anti pollon, -- that is, he came to be an antipsuchos,
   one to stand in the room of others, and to give his life for them.

   To make this the more evident and clear, I shall give a description of
   redemption properly so called, and make application of it in the
   several parts thereof unto that under consideration:-- "Redemption is
   the deliverance of any one from bondage or captivity, and the misery
   attending that condition, by the intervention or interposition of a
   price or ransom, paid by the redeemer to him by whose authority he is
   detained, that, being delivered, he may be in a state of liberty, at
   the disposal of the redeemer."

   And this will comprise the laws of this redemption, which are usually
   given. They are, first, On the part of the redeemer:-- 1. "Propinquus
   esto;" -- "Let him be near of kin." 2. "Consanguinitatis jure
   redimito;" -- "Let him redeem by right of consanguinity." 3. "Injusto
   possessori prædam eripito;" -- "Let him deliver the prey from the
   unjust possessor." 4. "Huic pretium nullum solvito;" -- "To him let no
   price be paid." 5. "Sanguinem pro redemptionis pretio vero Domino
   offerto;" -- "Let him offer or give his blood to the true Lord for a
   ransom, or price of redemption." Secondly, On the part of the
   redeemed:-- 1. "Libertatis jure felix gaudeto;" -- "Let him enjoy his
   liberty." 2. "Servitutis jugum ne iterum sponte suscipito;" -- "Let him
   not again willingly take on him the yoke of bondage." 3. "Deinceps
   servum se exhibeto redemptori;" -- "Let him in liberty be a servant to
   his redeemer."

   The general parts of this description of redemption Socinus himself
   consents unto: for whereas Covet had a little inconveniently defined
   "to redeem," saying, "Redimere aliquem est debitum solvere creditoris
   ejus nomine, qui solvendo non erat, sicque satisfacere creditori,"
   which is a proper description of the payment of another man's debts,
   and not of his redemption, Socinus, correcting this mistake, affirms
   that "redimere aliquem nihil aliud proprie significat quam captivum e
   manibus illius qui eum detinet pretio illi dato liberare," -- "to
   redeem any one properly signifies nothing else but to deliver him out
   of his hands that detained him captive, by a price given to him who
   detained him;" [496] which, as to the general nature of redemption,
   contains as much as what was before given in for the description of it.
   With the accommodation, therefore, of that description to the
   redemption which we have by the blood of Christ, I shall proceed,
   desiring the reader to remember that if I evince the redemption we have
   by Christ to be proper, and properly so called, the whole business of
   satisfaction is confessedly evinced.

   First. The general nature of it consists in deliverance. Thence Christ
   is called Ho rhuomenos, "The deliverer:" Rom. xi. 26, "As it is
   written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer." The word in the
   prophet, Isa. lix. 20, is nv'l?, that we may know what kind of
   deliverer Christ is, -- a deliverer by redemption. "He gave himself for
   our sins opos exeletai hemas, that he might deliver us," Gal. i. 4. He
   delivered us; but it was by giving himself for our sins. 1 Thess. i.
   10, "To wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
   Iesoun ton rhuomenon hemas apo tes orges tes erchomenes, -- Jesus, who
   delivered us from the wrath to come." So Luke i. 74; Rom. vii. 6; Heb.
   ii. 15; Col. i. 13.

   Now, as redemption, because its general nature consists in deliverance,
   is often expressed thereby, so deliverance, because it hath the effect
   of redemption, is or may be called redemption, though it be not
   properly so, but agrees in the end and effect only. Hence Moses is said
   to be lutrotes: Acts vii. 35, Touton ho Theos archonta kai lutroten
   apesteilen, "Him did God send a prince and a redeemer;" that is, a
   deliverer, one whom God used for the deliverance of his people. And
   because what he did, even the delivery of his people out of bondage,
   agreed with redemption in its end, the work itself is called
   redemption, and he is termed therein a redeemer, though it was not a
   direct redemption that he wrought, no ransom being paid for delivery.

   It is pleaded, First, "That God being said to redeem his people in
   sundry places in the Old Testament, which he could not possibly do by a
   ransom, therefore the redemption mentioned in the Scripture is
   metaphorical, a mere deliverance; and such is also that we have by
   Christ, without the intervention of any price."

   Secondly, "Moses, who was a type of Christ and a redeemer, who is so
   often said to redeem the people, yet, as it is known, did it without
   any ransom, by a mere deliverance; therefore did Christ so also."

   Not to trouble the reader with repetition of words, this is the sum of
   what is pleaded by the Racovian Catechism to prove our redemption by
   Christ not to be proper, but metaphorical; and so, consequently, that
   no satisfaction can be thence evinced:--

   "E verbo redimendi non posse effici satisfactionem hanc hinc est
   planum, quod de ipso Deo in novo et in prisco foedere scribitur, eum
   redimisse populum suum ex Ægypto, eum fecisse redemptionem populo suo;
   quod Moses fuerit redemptor, Acts vii. 35. Vox ideo redemptionis,
   simpliciter liberationem denotat." -- Rac. Cat. cap. viii. de Christo.

   And, indeed, what there they speak is the sum of the plea of Socinus as
   to this part of our description of redemption, "De Jesu Christo
   Servatore," lib. i. part. ii. cap. i.-iii.

   To remove these difficulties (if they may be so called), I shall only
   tender the ensuing considerations:--

   1. That because redemption is sometimes to be taken metaphorically, for
   mere deliverance, when it is spoken of God without any mention of a
   price or ransom, in such cases as wherein it was impossible that a
   ransom should be paid (as in the deliverance of the children of Israel
   from Egypt and Pharaoh, when it is expressly said to be done by power
   and an outstretched arm, Deut. iv. 34), therefore it must be so
   understood when it is spoken of Christ, the mediator, with express
   mention of a price or ransom, and when it was impossible but that a
   ransom must be paid, is a loose consequence, not deserving any notice.

   2. That all the places of Scripture where mention is made of God being
   a redeemer and redeeming his people may be referred unto these heads:--

   (1.) Such as call God the redeemer of his church in general, as the
   places before mentioned; and these are all to be referred immediately
   to the Son of God (the manner of his redemption being described in the
   New Testament); and so proper redemption is intended in them, compare
   Isa. liv. 5, with Eph. v. 25, 26.

   (2.) Such as mention some temporal deliverance that was typical of the
   spiritual redemption which we have by Jesus Christ; and it is called
   redemption, not so much from the general nature of deliverance, as from
   its pointing out to us that real and proper redemption that was
   typified by it. Such was God's redeeming his people out of Egypt.

   So there is no mention of redemption in the Scripture, but either it is
   proper, or receives that appellation from its relation to that which is
   so.

   3. This is indeed a very wretched and cursed way of interpreting
   Scripture, especially those passages of it which set out the grace of
   God and the love of Christ to us, -- namely, to do it by way of
   diminution and lessening. God takes and uses this word that is of use
   amongst men, namely, "redemption;" saith he, "Christ hath redeemed you
   with his own blood, -- he hath laid down a price for you." For men to
   come and interpret this, and say "He did it not properly, it was not a
   complete redemption, but metaphorical, a bare deliverance," is to
   blaspheme God and the work of his love and grace. It is a safe rule of
   interpreting Scripture, that in places mentioning the love and grace of
   God to us, the words are to be taken in their utmost significancy. It
   is a thing most unworthy a good and wise man to set out his kindness
   and benefits with great swelling words of mighty weight and importance,
   which, when the things signified by them come to be considered, must be
   interpreted by way of minoration; nor will any worthy man do so. Much
   less can it be once imagined that God has expressed his love and
   kindness and the fruits of it to us in great and weighty words, that,
   in their ordinary use and significancy, contain a great deal more than
   really he hath done. For any one so to interpret what he hath spoken,
   is an abomination into which I desire my soul may never enter.

   What the redemption of a captive is, and how it is brought about, we
   know. God tells us that Christ hath redeemed us, and that with his own
   blood. Is it not better to believe the Lord, and venture our souls upon
   it, than to go to God and say, "This thou hast said, indeed, but it is
   an improper and metaphorical redemption, a deliverance, that we have?"
   The truth is, it is so far from truth that God hath delivered the work
   of his grace, and our benefit thereby, in the death of Christ, in words
   too big in their proper signification for the things themselves, that
   no words whatever are sufficient to express it and convey it to our
   understandings.

   That Moses, who was a type of Christ in the work of redemption, and is
   called a redeemer, did redeem the people without the proper payment of
   a valuable ransom, therefore Christ did so also; -- to conclude thus, I
   say, is to say that the type and thing typified must in all things be
   alike; yea, that a similitude between them in that wherein their
   relation consists is not enough to maintain their relation, but there
   must be such an identity as in truth overthrows it. Christ tells us
   that the brazen serpent was a type of him: John iii. 14, "As Moses
   lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be
   lifted up." Now, if a man should thence argue, that because the brazen
   serpent was only lifted up, not crucified nor did shed his blood,
   therefore Christ was not crucified nor did shed his blood, would he be
   attended unto? The like may be said of Jonah, who was alive in the
   belly of the whale, when he was a type of Christ being dead in the
   earth. In the general nature of deliverance from captivity, there was
   an agreement in the corporeal deliverance of Moses and the spiritual of
   Christ, and here was the one a type of the other; in the manner of
   their accomplishment, the one did not represent the other, the one
   being said expressly to be done by power, the other by a ransom.

   Secondly. It is the delivery of one in captivity. All men, considered
   in the state of sin and alienation from God, are in captivity. Hence
   they are said to be "captives," and to be "bound in prison," Isa. lxi.
   1. And the work of Christ is to "bring out the prisoners from the
   prison, and them that sit in darkness" (that is, in the dungeon) "out
   of the prison-house," Isa. xlii. 7. He says "to the prisoners, Go
   forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves," chap. xlix. 9:
   as it is eminently expressed, Zech. ix. 11, "As for thee also, by the
   blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit
   wherein is no water." Here are prisoners, prisoners belonging to the
   daughter of Zion; for unto her, the church, he speaks, verse 9,
   "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion." Those other sheep of the fold of
   Christ, not yet gathered when this promise was given, are spoken of;
   and they are "in the pit wherein is no water;" -- a pit for security to
   detain them, that they may not escape; and without water, that they may
   in it find no refreshment. How are these prisoners delivered? By the
   blood of his covenant of whom he speaks: see verse 9, "Behold, thy King
   cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding
   upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass." It is a description
   of Christ when he rode to Jerusalem, to seal and confirm the covenant
   for the deliverance of the prisoners with his own blood; which is
   therefore called "The blood of the covenant wherewith he was
   sanctified," Heb. x. 29. Hence in the next verse, "Prisoners of hope"
   is a description of the elect, Zech. ix. 12.

   So also are they called captives expressly: Isa. xlix. 25, "Thus saith
   the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the
   prey of the terrible shall be delivered." Those who were in their
   captivity a prey to Satan, that mighty and cruel one, shall be
   delivered. And who shall do this? "The Lord thy Saviour and thy
   Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob," verse 26. He proclaims "liberty to
   the captives," Isa. lxi. 1, Luke iv. 18. And this is given in as the
   great fruit of the death of Christ, that upon his conquest of it he
   "led captivity captive," Ps. lxviii. 18, Eph. iv. 8, -- that is, either
   captivity actively, Satan who held and detained his in captivity, or
   passively, those who were in captivity to him.

   Thus being both prisoners and captives, they are said to be in bondage.
   Christ gives us liberty from that yoke of bondage, Gal. v. 1; and men
   are in bondage by reason of death all their days, Heb. ii. 15. There
   is, indeed, nothing that the Scripture more abounds in than this, that
   men in the state of sin are in prison, captivity, and bondage, -- are
   prisoners, captives, and slaves.

   Concerning this two things are considerable:-- 1. The cause of men's
   bondage and captivity, deserving or procuring it. 2. The efficient,
   principal cause of it, to whom they are in captivity.

   1. As for the first, as it is known, it is sin. To all this bondage and
   captivity men are sold by sin. In this business sin is considered two
   ways:--

   (1.) As a debt, whereof God is the creditor. Our Saviour hath taught us
   to pray for the forgiveness of our sins under that notion, Matt. vi.
   12, Aphes hemin ta opheilemata hemon, -- "Remit to us our debts." And
   in the parable of the lord and his servants, Matt. xviii. 23-35, he
   calls it to daneion, verse 27, and to opheilomenon, verse 30, "due
   debt;" all which he expounds by paraptomata, verse 35, -- "offences" or
   "transgressions." Debt makes men liable to prison for non-payment; and
   so doth sin (without satisfaction made) to the prison of hell. So our
   Saviour expresses it, Matt. v. 25, 26, "Agree with thine adversary
   quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the
   adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the
   officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, Thou
   shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost
   farthing." On this account are men prisoners for sin: They are bound in
   the prison-house because they have wasted the goods of their Master,
   and contracted a debt that they are no way able to pay; and if it be
   not paid for them, there they must lie to eternity. All mankind were
   cast into prison for that great debt they contracted in Adam, in their
   trustee. Being there, instead of making any earnings to pay the debt
   already upon them by the law, they contract more, and increase
   thousands of talents. But this use of the words "debt" and "prison,"
   applied to sin and punishment, is metaphorical.

   (2.) As a crime, rebellion, transgression against God, the great
   governor and judge of all the world. The criminalness, rebellion,
   transgression, the disobedience that is in sin, is more or less
   expressed by all the words in the original whereby any sins are
   signified and called. Now, for sin considered as rebellion are men cast
   into prison, captivity, and bondage, by way of judicial process and
   punishment.

   2. As for the principal cause of this captivity and imprisonment, it is
   God; for, --

   (1.) He is the creditor to whom these debts are due: Matt. vi. 9, 12,
   "Our Father which art in heaven, ... forgive us our debts." It is to
   him that we stand indebted the ten thousand talents "Against thee, thee
   only, have I sinned," says David, Ps. li. 4. God hath intrusted us with
   all we have to sin by or withal; he hath lent it us, to lay out for his
   glory. Our spending of what we have received upon our lusts, is running
   into debt unto God. Though he doth not reap where he did not sow, yet
   he requires his principal with advantage.

   (2.) And properly he is the great king, judge, and governor of the
   world, who hath given his law for the rule of our obedience; and every
   transgression thereof is a rebellion against him. Hence, to sin is to
   rebel, and to transgress, and to be perverse, to turn aside from the
   way, to cast off the yoke of the Lord, as it is everywhere expressed.
   God is "the one lawgiver," James iv. 12, who is able to kill and to
   destroy for the transgression of it. It is his law which is broken, and
   upon the breach whereof he says, "Cursed be every one that hath so
   done," Deut. xxvii. 26. He is "the judge of all the earth," Gen. xviii.
   25, yea, "God is judge himself," Ps. i. 6; and we shall be judged by
   his law, James ii. 10-12; and his judgment is, "That they which commit
   sin are worthy of death," Rom. i. 32. And he is the "king for ever and
   ever," Ps. x. 16. He reigneth and executeth judgment. Now, who should
   commit the rebel that offends, who should be the author of the
   captivity and imprisonment of the delinquent, but he who is the king,
   judge, and lawmaker?

   (3.) He doth actually do it: Rom. xi. 32, Sunekleise ho Theos tous
   pantas eis apeitheian -- "God hath shut up all under disobedience." He
   hath laid them up close prisoners for their disobedience; and they
   shall not go out until satisfaction be made. In the parable, Matt.
   xviii., of the lord or master and his servants, this is evident; and
   chap. v. 25, it is the judge that delivers the man to the officer to be
   cast into prison. Look who it is that shall inflict the final
   punishment upon the captives, if a ransom be not paid for them, he it
   is by whose power and authority they are committed, and to whom
   principally they are prisoners and captives. Now, this is God only. He
   can cast both body and soul into hell fire, Matt. x. 28; and wicked men
   shall be destroyed "from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory
   of his power," 2 Thess. i. 9. In brief, God is the judge; the law is
   the law of God; the sentence denounced is condemnation from God; the
   curse inflicted is the curse of God; the wrath wherewith men are
   punished is the wrath of God; he that finds a ransom is God: and
   therefore it is properly and strictly he to whom sinners are prisoners
   and captives, 2 Pet. ii. 4. And therefore, when in the Scripture at any
   time men are said to be in bondage to Satan, it is but as to the
   officer of a judge, or the jailer; to their sin, it is but as to their
   fetters, as shall be afterward more fully discovered.

   And this removes the first question and answer of the Racovians to this
   purpose. Socinus, "De Servatore," expresses himself to the whole
   business of redemption in three chapters, lib. i. part. ii. cap.
   i.-iii.; the sum of which the catechists have laboured to comprise in
   as many questions and answers. The first is, --

   Q. What dost thou answer to those testimonies which witness that we are
   redeemed of Christ?

   A. It is hence evident that satisfaction cannot be confirmed from the
   word "redeeming," -- 1. Because it is written of God himself, both in
   the Old and New Testament, that he redeemed his people out of Egypt,
   that he redeemed his people; 2. Because it is written that God redeemed
   Abraham and David, and that Moses was a redeemer, and that we are
   redeemed from our iniquities and our vain conversation, and from the
   curse of the law; for it is certain that God made satisfaction to none,
   nor can it be said that satisfaction is made either to our iniquities,
   or to our vain conversation, or to the law. [497]

   I say this whole plea is utterly removed by what hath been spoken; for,
   -- 1. In what sense redemption is ascribed to God and Moses, without
   the least prejudice of that proper redemption that was made by the
   blood of Christ, hath been declared, and shall be farther manifested
   when we come to demonstrate the price that was paid in this redemption.

   2. It is true, there is no satisfaction made to our sin and vain
   conversation when we are redeemed; but satisfaction being made to Him
   to whom it is due, we are delivered from them. But of this afterwards.

   3. Satisfaction is properly made to the law when the penalty which it
   threatens and prescribes is undergone, as in the case insisted on it
   was. In the meantime, our catechists are sufficiently vain, in
   supposing our argument to lie in the word "redimere." Though something
   hath been spoken of the word in the original, yet our plea is from the
   thing itself.

   This Socinus thus expresses:--

   There is also required he who held the captive, otherwise he is not a
   captive. To him, in our deliverance, if we will consider the thing
   itself exactly, many things do answer, for many things do detain us
   captives; now they are sin, the devil, and the world, and that which
   followeth sin, the guilt of eternal death, or the punishment of death
   appointed to us. [498]

   Ans. A lawful captive is detained two ways, -- First, Directly; and
   that two ways also:--

   1. Legally, juridically, and authoritatively: so is sinful man detained
   captive of God. "The wrath of God abideth on him," John iii. 36, as
   hath been declared.

   2. Instrumentally, in subservience to the authority of the other: so is
   man in bondage to Satan, and the law, and fear of death to come, Heb.
   ii. 14, 15.

   Secondly, Consequentially, and by accident: so a man is detained by his
   shackles, as in the filth of the prison; so is a man captive to sin and
   the world.

   Nor are all these properly the detainers of us in captivity, from which
   we are redeemed, any more than the gallows keeps a malefactor in
   prison, from which by a pardon and ransom he is delivered.

   To proceed with the description of redemption given, it is the delivery
   of him who was captive from prison or captivity, and all the miseries
   attending that condition.

   1. What I mean by the prison is easily gathered from what hath been
   delivered concerning the prisoner or captive, and Him that holds him
   captive. If the captive be a sinner as a sinner, and he who holds him
   captive be God, by his justice making him liable to punishment, his
   captivity must needs be his obnoxiousness unto the wrath of God on the
   account of his justice for sin. This are we delivered from by this
   redemption that is in the blood of Jesus, Rom. iii. 23-25: "For all
   have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely
   by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God
   hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to
   declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,
   through the forbearance of God." Verse 23 is the description of the
   state of our captivity. Having "sinned," we are "come short of the
   glory of God." Usperountai, they fall short in their race, and are by
   no means able to come up to a participation of God. Our delivery and
   the means of it are expressed, verse 24. Our delivery: we are
   "justified freely by his grace," or delivered from that condition and
   state of sin wherein it was impossible for us to reach and attain the
   glory of God. The procuring cause of which liberty is expressed in the
   next words, dia tes apolutroseos, by the redemption or ransom-paying
   that is in the blood of Jesus; that is the cause of our deliverance
   from that condition wherein we were. Whence and how it is so is
   expressed, verse 25: God set him forth for that end, that we might have
   deliverance "through faith in his blood," or by faith be made partakers
   of the redemption that is in his blood, or purchased by it. And this to
   "declare his righteousness." We have it this way, that the
   righteousness of God may be declared, whereto satisfaction is made by
   the death of Christ; for that also is included in the word
   "propitiation," as shall be afterward proved.

   Thus, whilst men are in this captivity, "the wrath of God abideth on
   them," John iii. 36; and the full accomplishment of the execution of
   that wrath is called "The wrath to come," 1 Thess. i. 10, which we are
   delivered from.

   In this sense are we said to "have redemption in his blood," Col. i.
   14, or to have deliverance from our captivity by the price he paid, and
   by his death to be delivered from the fear of death, Heb. ii. 15, or
   our obnoxiousness thereto; it being the justice or judgment of God
   "that they which commit sin are worthy of death," Rom. i. 32. Christ by
   undergoing it delivered us from it.

   Whence is that of the apostle, Rom. viii. 33, 34, "Who shall lay any
   thing to their charge? who shall condemn them?" Who should but God? It
   is God, against whom they have sinned, whose the law is, and who alone
   can pronounce sentence of condemnation on the offenders, and inflict
   penalty accordingly. Yea, but "it is God that justifieth;" that is,
   that frees men from their obnoxiousness to punishment for sin in the
   first sense of it, which is their captivity, as hath been declared. But
   how comes this about? Why, "it is Christ that died." It is by the death
   of Christ that we have this redemption.

   2. From all the miseries that attend that state and condition. These
   are usually referred to three heads:-- (1.) The power of Satan; (2.) Of
   sin; (3.) Of the world; from all which we are said to be redeemed. And
   these are well compared to the jailer, filth, and fetters of the prison
   wherein the captives are righteously detained.

   (1.) For the first, Col. i. 13, 14, "Who hath delivered us from the
   power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear
   Son; in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness
   of sins." The "power of darkness" is the power of the prince of
   darkness, of Satan. This God delivers us from, by the redemption that
   is in the blood of Christ, verse 14. And how? Even as he who delivers a
   captive from the judge by a price delivers him also from the jailer who
   kept him in prison. By his death (which, as hath been showed, was a
   price and a ransom), he deprived Satan of all his power over us; which
   is called his destroying of him, Heb. ii. 14, -- that is, not the devil
   as to his essence and being, but as to his power and authority over
   those who are made partakers of his death.

   The words of Socinus to this purpose may be taken notice of, Lib. de
   Servat. lib. i. part. ii. cap. ii.:--

   Nothing is wanting in this deliverance, that it might wholly answer a
   true redemption, but only that he who detained the captive should
   receive the price. Although it seems to some that it may be said that
   the devil received the price which intervened in our redemption, as the
   ancient divines, among whom was Ambrosius and Augustine, made bold to
   speak, yet that ought to seem most absurd, and it is true that this
   price was received by none: for on that account chiefly is our
   deliverance not a true but a metaphorical redemption, because in it
   there is none that should receive the price; for if that which is in
   the place of a price be received (by him who delivers the captive),
   then not a metaphorical but a true price had intervened, and thereupon
   our redemption had been proper. [499]

   It is confessed that nothing is wanting to constitute that we speak of
   to be a true, proper, and real redemption, but only that the price paid
   be received of him that delivered the captives. That this is God we
   proved; that the price is paid to him we shall nextly prove.

   The only reason given why the price is not paid to any, is because it
   is not paid to the devil. But was it the law of Satan we had
   transgressed? was he the judge that cast us into prison? was it him to
   whom we were indebted? was it ever heard that the price of redemption
   was paid to the jailer? Whether any of the ancients said so or no I
   shall not now trouble myself to inquire, or in what sense they said it;
   the thing in itself is ridiculous and blasphemous.

   (2.) Sin. "He redeemed us from all iniquity," Tit. ii. 14; and we were
   "redeemed by the precious blood of Christ from our vain conversation
   received by tradition from our fathers," 1 Pet. i. 18, 19. This
   redeeming us from our sins respects two things:-- [1.] The guilt of
   them, that they should not condemn us; and, [2.] The power of them,
   that they should not rule in us, In the places mentioned it is the
   latter that is principally intended; which is evident from what is
   opposed to the captivity under sin that is spoken of. In the one place
   it is "purifying unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works," Tit. ii. 14; in the other, the "purifying of our souls in
   obedience to the truth through the Spirit," 1 Pet. i. 22. Now, we are
   redeemed from the power of our sins by the blood of Christ, not
   immediately, but consequentially, as a captive is delivered from his
   fetters and filth upon the payment of his ransom. Christ's satisfying
   the justice of God, reconciling him to us by his death, hath also
   procured the gift of his Spirit for us, to deliver us from the power of
   our sins. The foundation of this being laid in the blood of Christ, and
   the price which thereby he paid, our delivery from our sins belongs to
   his redemption, and we are therefore said to be redeemed by him from
   our vain conversation.

   And the great plea of our adversaries, that this redemption is not
   proper because we are redeemed from our iniquities and vain
   conversation, to which no ransom can be paid, will then be freed from
   ridiculous folly, when they shall give an instance of a ransom being
   paid to the prisoner's fetters before his delivery, whereunto our sins
   do rather answer, than to the judge.

   There is a redeeming of us from the guilt of sin, which hath a twofold
   expression:-- Of redeeming us from the "curse of the law," Gal. iii.
   13; and of the "redemption of transgressions," Heb. ix. 15.

   For the first, the "curse of the law" is the curse due to sin, Deut.
   xxvii. 26; that is, to the transgression of the law. This may be
   considered two ways:-- In respect of its rise and fountain, or its
   "terminus a quo;" in respect of its end and effect, or its "terminus ad
   quem."

   For the first, or the rise of it, it is the justice of God, or the just
   and holy will of God, requiring punishment for sin, as the vengeance
   that is inflicted actually for sin is called the "wrath of God," Rom.
   i. 18; that is, his justice and indignation against sin. In this sense,
   to "redeem us from the curse of the law," is to make satisfaction to
   the justice of God, from whence that curse doth arise, that it should
   not be inflicted on us; and thus it falls in with what was delivered
   before concerning our captivity by the justice of God.

   Secondly, As it is the penalty itself, so we are delivered from it by
   this ransom-paying of Christ, as the punishment which we should have
   undergone, had not he undertaken for us and redeemed us. Secondly, For
   the apolutrosis parabaseon, Heb. ix. 15, it can be nothing but making
   reparation for the injury done by transgression. It is a singular
   phrase, but may receive some light from that of Heb. ii. 17, where
   Christ is said to be a high priest, eis to ilaskesthai, "to reconcile
   the sins of the people," -- that is, to make reconciliation for them;
   of the sense whereof afterward.

   (3.) He redeems from the world, Gal. iv. 5.

   The third thing is, that this deliverance from captivity be by the
   intervention of a price properly so called. That Christ did pay such a
   price I proved before, -- which is the foundation of this discourse.

   The word lutron, and those arising from thence, were specially insisted
   on. The known use of the word is "redemptionis pretium;" so among the
   best authors of the Greek tongue: Zonta labontes aphekan aneu lutron,
   Xenoph. Hellen. 7; -- "They took him away without paying his ransom,"
   or the price of his redemption. And, Epempse ta lutra to Anniba kai
   tous aichmalotous apelabe, says Plutarch in Fabius; -- "He sent their
   ransom to Hannibal and received the prisoners." And from thence lutroo
   is of the same import and signification. So in the argument of the
   first book of the Iliad, speaking of Chrysis, that he came to the camp
   boulomenos lutrosasthai ten thugatera, -- "to pay a price for the
   redemption of his daughter." And Aristotle, Ethic. lib. ix. cap. ii.,
   disputing whether a benefit or good turn be not to be repaid rather
   than a favour done to any other, gives an instance of a prisoner
   redeemed, to lutrothenti para leston poteron ton lusamenon
   antilutroteon, etc., -- whether he who is redeemed by the payment of a
   ransom from a robber be to redeem him who redeemed him, if captive,
   etc. But this is so far confessed, that if it may be evinced that this
   price is paid to any, it will not be denied but that it is a proper
   price of redemption, as before was discovered.

   That the death of Christ is such a price I proved abundantly at the
   entrance of this discourse. It is so frequently and evidently expressed
   in the Scripture to be such that it is not to be questioned. I shall
   not farther insist upon it.

   All that our adversaries have to object is, as was said, that seeing
   this price is not paid to any, it cannot be a price properly so called;
   for as for the nature of it, they confess it may be a price. So Socinus
   acknowledgeth it. Saith he:--

   I understand the proper use of the word to "redeem" to be when a true
   price is given. True price I call not only money, but whatever is given
   to him that delivers the captive to satisfy him, although many things
   in the redemption be metaphorical. [500]

   That God detains the captive hath been proved; that the price is paid
   to him, though it be not silver and gold, and that that he might be
   satisfied, shall be farther evinced: so that we have redemption
   properly so called.

   Fourthly. It remains, then, that we farther manifest that the price was
   paid to God.

   Although enough hath been said already to evince the truth of this, yet
   I shall farther put it out of question by the ensuing observations and
   inferences:--

   1. To the payment of a price or ransom properly so called, -- which, as
   is acknowledged, is not necessary that it should be money or the like,
   1 Pet. i. 18, but any thing that may satisfy him that detains the
   captive, -- it is not required that it should be paid into the hand of
   him that is said to receive it, but only that it be some such thing as
   he requires as the condition of releasing the captive. It may consist
   in personal service, which is impossible to be properly paid into the
   hand of any. For instance, if a father be held captive, and he that
   holds him so requires that, for the delivery of his father, the son
   undertake a difficult and hazardous warfare wherein he is concerned,
   and he do it accordingly, this son doth properly ransom his father,
   though no real price be paid into the hand of him that detained him. It
   is sufficient to prove that this ransom was paid by Christ unto God, if
   it be proved that, upon the prescription of God, he did that and
   underwent that which he esteemed, and was to him a valuable
   compensation for the delivery of sinners.

   2. The propriety of paying a ransom to any, where it lies in undergoing
   the penalty that was due to the ransomed, consists in the voluntary
   consent of him to whom the ransom is paid and him that pays it unto
   this commutation; which in this business we have firmly evinced. And
   the price paid by Christ could be no other; for God was not our
   detainer in captivity as a sovereign conqueror, that came upon us by
   force and kept us prisoners, but as a just judge and lawgiver, who had
   seized on us for our transgressions: so that not his power and will
   were to be treated withal, but his law and justice; and so the ransom
   was properly paid to him in the undergoing that penalty which his
   justice required.

   3. There must some differences be allowed between spiritual, eternal,
   and civil, corporeal, temporal deliverances; which yet doth not make
   spiritual redemption to be improper, nay, rather the other is said to
   be improper wherein it agrees not thereunto. The one is spiritual, the
   other temporal; so that in every circumstance it is not to be expected
   that they should agree.

   4. There are two things distinctly in God to be considered in this
   business:-- (1.) His love, his will, or purpose; (2.) His justice, law,
   and truth. In respect of his love, his will, his purpose, or good
   pleasure, God himself found out, appointed, and provided this ransom.
   The giving of Christ is ascribed to his love, will, and good pleasure,
   John iii. 16, Rom. v. 8, viii. 32, 1 John iv. 9, 10, as he had promised
   by his prophets of old, Luke i. 67-70. But his justice, and law, and
   truth, in their several considerations, required the ransom; and in
   respect of them he accepted it, as hath been showed at large. So that
   nothing in the world is more vain than that of our adversaries, that
   God procured and appointed this price, therefore he did not accept it.
   That is, either God's love or his justice must be denied; either he
   hath no justice against sin or no love for sinners; -- in the
   reconciliation of which two, the greatest and most intense hatred
   against sin, and the most inexpressible love to some sinners in the
   blood of his only Son, lies the great mystery of the gospel; which
   these men are unacquainted withal.

   5. That God may be said to receive this price, it was not necessary
   that any accession should be made to his riches by the ransom, but that
   he underwent no loss by our deliverance. This is the difference between
   a conqueror or a tyrant and a just ruler, in respect of their captives
   and prisoners. Says the tyrant or conqueror, "Pay me so much, whereby I
   may be enriched, or I will not part with my prisoner;" says the just
   ruler and judge, "Take care that my justice be not injured, that my law
   be satisfied, and I will deliver the prisoner." It is enough, to make
   good God's acceptance of the price, that his justice suffer not by the
   delivery of the prisoner, as it did not, Rom. iii. 25; yea, it was
   exalted and made glorious above all that it could have been in the
   everlasting destruction of the sinner.

   These things being thus premised, it will not be difficult to establish
   the truth asserted, namely, that this price or ransom was paid to God;
   for, --

   1. A price of redemption, a ransom, must be paid to some one or other;
   the nature of the thing requires it. That the death of Christ was a
   price or ransom, properly so called, hath been showed before. The
   ridiculous objection, that then it must be paid to Satan or our sin,
   hath also been sufficiently removed: so that God alone remains to whom
   it is to be paid; for unless to some it is paid, it is not a price or
   ransom.

   2. The price of redemption is to be paid to him who detains the captive
   by way of jurisdiction, right, and law-power. That God is he who thus
   detained the captive was also proved before. He is the great
   householder that calls his servants, that do or should serve him, to an
   account, sunarai logon, Matt. xviii. 23, 24; and wicked men are kataras
   tekna, 2 Pet. ii. 14, the children of his curse, obnoxious to it. It is
   his judgment "that they which commit sin are worthy of death," Rom. i.
   32; and Christ is a propitiation to "declare his righteousness," chap.
   iii. 25; and it is his wrath from which we are delivered by this
   ransom, chap. ii. 5, 1 Thess. i. 10; the law was his to which Christ
   was made obnoxious, Gal. iv. 4; the curse his which he was made, chap.
   iii. 13; it was his will he came to do and suffer, Heb. x. 7, -- it was
   his will that he should drink off the cup of his passion, Matt. xxvi.
   42; it pleased him to bruise him, Isa. liii. 10; he made all our
   iniquities to meet upon him, verse 6: so that, doubtless, this ransom
   was paid to him. We intend no more by it than what in these places is
   expressed.

   3. This ransom was also a sacrifice, as hath been declared. Look, then,
   to whom the sacrifice was offered, to him the ransom was paid. These
   are but several notions of the same thing. Now, the sacrifice he
   offered to God, Eph. v. 2; to him, then, also and only was this ransom
   paid.

   4. Christ paid this ransom as he was a mediator and surety. Now he was
   the mediator between God and man, and therefore he must pay this price
   to one of them, either to God or man, and it is not difficult to
   determine whether. 1 Tim. ii. 5, 6, gives us this fully. He is the
   mediator, and as such he gave himself antilutron, a price of redemption
   to God.

   From this description of redemption properly so called, and the
   application of it to the redemption made by Jesus Christ, we thus
   argue:--

   He who by his own blood and death paid the price of our redemption to
   God, in that he underwent what was due to us, and procured our liberty
   and deliverance thereby, he made satisfaction properly for our sins;
   but when we were captives for sin to the justice of God, and committed
   thereon to the power of sin and Satan, Christ by his death and blood
   paid the price of our redemption to God, and procured our deliverance
   thereby: therefore he made satisfaction to God for our sins.

   For the farther confirmation of what hath been delivered, some few of
   the most eminent testimonies given to this truth are to be explained
   and vindicated, wherewith I shall close this discourse of our
   redemption by Christ. Out of the very many that may be insisted on, I
   shall choose only those that follow:--

   1. Rom. iii. 24, 25, "Being justified freely by his grace through the
   redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a
   propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness
   for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
   God."

   Redemption in itself, in its effect in respect of us, with all its
   causes, is here expressed. Its effect in respect of us is, that we are
   "justified freely," dikaioumenoi dorean: not brought easily, and with
   little labour, to be righteous or honest, as some vainly imagine (Grot.
   in loc.), but accepted freely with God, without the performance of the
   works of the law, whereby the Jews sought after righteousness. The end
   on the part of God is the declaration of his righteousness. The means
   procuring this end is the blood of Christ, redemption by Christ and in
   his blood. The means of communicating this effect, on the part of God,
   is the setting forth Christ a propitiation; on our part, as to
   application, it is faith in his blood.

   (1.) As to the effect of our justification, it shall afterward be
   considered. The manner, or rise of it rather (for both may be denoted),
   on the part of God, is dorean, that is, "freely;" or, as it is
   expounded in the next words, te autou chariti, "by his grace." Our
   redemption and the effects of it are free on the part of God, in
   respect of his purpose and decree, which is called ekloge charitos,
   Rom. xi. 5, his great design and contrivance of the work of our
   salvation and deliverance. This he did "according to the good pleasure
   of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace," Eph. i. 5, 6;
   "according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself,"
   verse 9; "according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after
   the counsel of his own will," verse 11. And it is free in regard of the
   love from whence Christ was sent, John iii. 16; which also is ascribed
   te chariti Theou, Heb. ii. 9. And it is free in respect of us; we do
   not obtain it by the works of the law, Rom. iv. 6, neither can it be so
   attained, nor is that required of us: and free on our part, in that
   nothing of us is required in way of satisfaction, recompense, or
   ransom. "He spared not his own Son," but "with him freely gives us all
   things," Rom. viii. 32. Dikaioumenoi dorean, "We are justified freely;"
   that is, we are delivered from our bondage without any satisfaction
   made by us, or works performed by us to attain it, God having freely
   designed this way of salvation, and sent Jesus Christ to do this work
   for us.

   They are [says Grotius] brought to righteousness without that labour
   that is required for lesser, even philosophical virtues. Faith makes an
   abridgment of the work. [501]

   The proton pseudos of the great man, in the whole interpretation of
   that epistle, as of others of sundry sorts besides himself, is, that to
   be justified is to be brought to righteousness by the practice of
   virtue and honesty (which answers to that the Scripture calls
   sanctification), with as gross a shutting out of light as can befall
   any man in the world. This, with that notion which he hath of faith, is
   the bottom of this interpretation. But, --

   Let him tell us freely what instance he can give of this use of the
   word dorean, which here he imposeth on us, that it should signify the
   facility of doing a thing; and withal, whether these words,
   dikaioumenoi dorean, denote an act of God or of them that are
   justified; -- whether "being justified freely by his grace" be his free
   justifying of us, as to what is actively denoted, or our easy
   performance of the works of righteousness? That dorean in this place
   should relate to our duties, and signify "easily," and not to the act
   of God accepting us, and import" freely," is such a violence offered to
   the Scripture as nothing could have compelled the learned man to
   venture on but pure necessity of maintaining the Socinian
   justification.

   As for the "philosophical virtues," which the gods sold for labour,
   they were "splendida peccata," and no more.

   As to this part of the words, Socinus himself was not so far out of the
   way as the annotator. Saith he, "Justificati gratis, sensus est, partam
   nobis esse peccatorum nostrorum absolutionem (id enim ut scis quod ad
   nos attinet reipsa justificari est) non quidem per legis opera, quibus
   illam commeriti sumus, sed gratis per gratiam Dei," De Servat. lib. i.
   part. ii. cap. ii.

   (2.) The end on the part of God is endeixis dikaiosunes, "the
   declaration of his righteousness." Dikaiosune is properly God's justice
   as he is a judge. It is true, chsd?, is often rendered by the LXX.
   dikaiosune, and by us from thence, "righteousness," which signifies,
   indeed, benignity, kindness, and goodness, -- and so tsdqh?, which is
   "righteousness," is rendered by them sometimes eleos, "mercy," and the
   circumstances of the place may sometimes require that signification of
   the word, -- but firstly and properly, it is that property of God
   whereby as a judge he renders to every one according to their ways
   before him, rewarding those that obey him, and punishing transgressors.
   This I have elsewhere declared at large. [502] Hence he issvpht tsdq?,
   Ps. ix. 5; which, as Paul speaks, 2 Tim. iv. 8, is ho dikaios krites,
   the "righteous judge." So Rom. i. 32; 2 Thess. i. 6; Rev. xv. 5: so
   Isa. lix. 16, "And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that
   there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him;
   and his righteousness, it sustained him." His righteousness sustained
   him in executing vengeance on the enemies of his church. This is the
   righteousness that God aimed to manifest and to declare in our
   redemption by Christ, "that he might be just," as the words follow,
   namely, that he might be known to be just and righteous in taking such
   sore vengeance of sin in the flesh of Jesus Christ his Son, Rom. viii.
   3. Hence did God appear to be exceeding righteous, -- of purer eyes
   than to behold iniquity. He declared to all the world what was due to
   sin, and what must be expected by men if they are not partakers of the
   redemption which is in the blood of Jesus Christ, Rom. viii. 3.

   Grotius would have dikaiosune here to signify "goodness" and "bounty;"
   which as we deny not but that in some places in the Old Testament where
   it is used by the LXX. it doth or may do, so we say here that sense can
   have no place which nowhere is direct and proper; for the thing
   intended by it in that sense is expressed before in these words, Dorean
   te chariti autou, and is not consistent with that that follows, Eis to
   einai auton dikaion, which represents God as he is dikaios krites, as
   was spoken before.

   Socinus goes another way. Says he, "In Christo, Deus ut ostenderet se
   veracem et fidelem esse, quod significant verba ilia, justitiæ suæ,"
   etc., referring it to God's righteousness of verity and fidelity in
   fulfilling his promise of forgiveness of sins. But says Grotius,
   righteousness cannot be here interpreted, "de fide in promissis
   proestandis, quia quæ sequuntur non ad Judæos solos pertinent, sed
   etiam ad Gentes quibus promissio nulls erat facta," -- "because
   Gentiles are spoken of, and not the Jews only, but to them there was no
   promise given." A reason worthy the Annotations; as though the promise
   was not made to Abraham that he should be heir of the world, and to all
   his seed, not according to the flesh only; and as though the learned
   man himself did not think the first promise to have been made, and
   always to have belonged, to all and every man in the world. But yet
   neither will the sense of Socinus stand, for the reasons before given.

   But how are these ends brought about, that we should be dikaioumenoi
   dorean, and yet there should be endeixis dikaiosunes?

   (3.) Ans. The means procuring all this is the blood of Christ; it is
   dia tes apolutroseos tes en Christo Iesou, -- "by the redemption that
   is in Christ Jesus." And how that redemption is wrought he expresseth
   when he shows how we are made partakers of it, dia tes pisteos en to
   autou haimati, -- "through faith in his blood." The redemption wrought
   and procured by the blood of Christ is the procuring cause of all this.
   The causa proegoumene is the grace of God, of which before; the causa
   prokatarktike is this blood of Christ. This redemption, as here, is
   called apolutrosis, Luke xxi. 28, Eph. i. 7, Col. i. 14; lutrosis, Luke
   i. 68, ii. 38, Heb. ix. 12; lutron, Matt. xx. 28, Mark x. 45;
   antilutron, 1 Tim. ii. 6; and in respect of the effect, rhusis, Rom.
   vii. 24, xi. 26, Col. i. 13, 1 Thess. i. 10. This is the procuring
   cause, as I said, of the whole effect of God's free grace here
   mentioned. We are justified freely, because we have redemption by the
   blood of Christ; he obtained it for us by the price of his blood.

   I rather abide in the former sense of lutron (from whence is
   apolutrosis), to be "a price of redemption," than to interpret it by
   "lustrum," and so to refer it to the sacrifices of purification, which
   belong to another consideration of the death of Christ. And yet the
   consideration of the blood of Christ as a sacrifice hath place here
   also, as shall be discovered. This is that which is here asserted, We
   have forgiveness of sins by the intervention of the blood of Christ,
   obtaining redemption for us; which is that we aim to prove from this
   place.

   Grotius gives this exposition of the words:--

   Christ by his obedience (especially in his death), and the prayers
   accompanying it, obtained this of his Father, that he should not
   forsake and harden mankind, drenched in grievous sins, but should give
   them a way of coming to righteousness by Jesus Christ, and should
   deliver them from a necessity of dying in their sin, by revealing a way
   whereby they might escape it. [503]

   [1.] It is well it is granted that the death of Christ respected God in
   the first place, and the obtaining somewhat of him; which the
   annotator's friends deny.

   [2.] That the purchase of Christ was not for all mankind, that they
   might be delivered, but for the elect, that they should be delivered,
   has elsewhere been declared.

   [3.] Christ by his death did not obtain of his Father that he should
   reveal or appoint that way of obtaining deliverance and salvation which
   by him we have. This, as the giving of Christ himself, was of the free
   grace and love of God. Nor is the appointment of the way of salvation,
   according to the covenant of grace, anywhere assigned to the death of
   Christ, but to the love of God sending his Son and appointing him to be
   a mediator, though the good things of the covenant be purchased by him.

   [4.] This is all the effect here assigned to the blood-shedding of
   Jesus Christ, this is the redemption we have thereby: "He obtained of
   his Father that a better way of coming to righteousness than that of
   the law or that of philosophy might be declared to us"! The mystery of
   the whole is: "Christ, by his obedience to God, obtained this, that
   himself should be exalted to give a new law and teach a new doctrine,
   in obedience whereunto we might come to be righteous;" which must needs
   be an excellent explication of these words, "We have redemption by his
   blood," which plainly express the price he paid for us, and the effect
   that ensued thereon.

   Socinus goes another way. Says he:--

   The intervention of the blood of Christ, though it moved not God to
   grant us deliverance from the punishment of sin, yet it moved us to
   accept of it being offered, and to believe in Christ. [504]

   That is, the blood of Christ, being paid as a price of our redemption,
   hath no effect in respect of him to whom it is paid, but only in
   respect of them for whom it is paid; than which imagination nothing can
   be more ridiculous.

   (4.) The means of application of the redemption mentioned, or
   participation in respect of us, is faith. It is dia pisteos en haimati
   autou. Of this we have no occasion to speak.

   (5.) The means of communication on the part of God is in these words,
   Hon proeTheto ho Theos hilasterion -- "Whom God hath set forth to be a
   propitiation." God set him forth for this end and purpose. The word
   proetheto may design various acts of God; as, --

   [1.] His purpose and determination or decree of giving Christ; whence
   our translators have in the margin rendered it "fore-ordained," as the
   word is used Eph. i. 9, Hen proetheto en hauto, -- "Which he
   fore-purposed in himself." Or, --

   [2.] God's proposal of him beforehand in types and sacrifices to the
   Jews, the preposition pro being often in composition used in that sense
   in this epistle, chap. iii. 9, xi. 35, xv. 4. Or:--

   [3.] For the actual exhibition of him in the flesh when God sent him
   into the world. Or:--

   [4.] It may refer to the open exposition and publication of him in the
   world by the gospel; for, as we shall afterward show, the ensuing words
   hold out an allusion to the ark, which now in Christ, the veil being
   rent, is exposed to the open view of believers. Hence John tells us,
   Rev. xi. 19, when the temple was opened, "there was seen in it the ark
   of the testament;" which, as it was not at all in the second temple,
   the true Ark being to be brought in, no more was it to be seen upon the
   opening of the first, where it was, being closed in the holiest of
   holies. But now in the ordinances of the gospel, the Ark is
   perspicuous, because Theos proetheto, -- God hath set it forth to
   believers.

   Now, he was set forth hilasterion, "a propitiation." There is none but
   has observed that this is the name of the covering of the ark or the
   mercy-seat that is applied to Christ, Heb. ix. 5; but the true reason
   and sense of it hath scarce been observed. Ours generally would prove
   from hence that Christ did propitiate God by the sacrifice of himself.
   That may have something from the general notice of the word referred
   to, the "sacrificia," hilastika (whereof afterward), but not from the
   particular intimated. The mercy-seat did not atone God for the sins
   that were committed against the law that was in the ark, but declared
   him to be atoned and appeased. That this is the meaning of it, that as
   the mercy-seat declared God to be atoned so also is Christ set forth to
   declare that God was atoned, not to atone him, Socinus contends at
   large, but to the utter confusion of his cause; for, --

   [1.] If this declares God to be "pacatus" and "placatus," then God was
   provoked, and some way was used for his atonement. And, --

   [2.] This is indeed the true import of that type and the application of
   it here by our apostle. The mercy-seat declared God to be appeased; but
   how? By the blood of the sacrifice that was offered without, and
   brought into the holy place. The high priest never went into that place
   about the worship of God but it was with the blood of that sacrifice,
   which was expressly appointed to make atonement, Lev. xvi.. God would
   not have the mercy-seat once seen, nor any pledge of his being atoned,
   but by the blood of the propitiatory sacrifice. So it is here. God sets
   out Jesus Christ as a propitiation, and declares himself to be appeased
   and reconciled; but how? By the blood of Christ, by the sacrifice of
   himself, by the price of redemption which he paid. This is the
   intendment of the apostle: Christ by his blood, and the price he paid
   thereby, with the sacrifice he made, having atoned God, or made
   atonement with him for us, God now sets him forth, the veil of the
   temple being rent, to the eye of all believers, as the Mercy-seat
   wherein we may see God fully reconciled to us.

   And this may serve for the vindication of the testimony to the truth
   insisted on; and this is the same with 2 Cor. v. 18.

   It would be too long for me to insist in particular on the full
   vindication of the other testimonies that are used for the confirmation
   of this truth; I shall give them, therefore, together in such a way as
   that their efficacy to the purpose in hand may be easily discerned.

   We are bought by Christ, saith the apostle: Egorasthete, "Ye are
   bought," 1 Cor. vi. 20. But this buying may be taken metaphorically for
   a mere deliverance, as certainly it is, 2 Pet. ii. 1, "Denying the Lord
   that bought them," -- that is, delivered them, -- for it is spoken of
   God the Father. It may be so, the word may be so used, and therefore,
   to show the propriety of it here, the apostle adds times, "with a
   price:" "Ye are bought with a price." To be bought with a price doth
   nowhere signify to be barely delivered, but to be delivered with a
   valuable compensation for our deliverance. But what is this price
   wherewith we are bought? 1 Pet. i. 18, 19, "Not with silver and gold,
   but timio haimati Christou," -- with the precious (honourable) blood of
   Christ." Why timion haima, "the precious blood?" That we may know that
   in this business it was valued at a sufficient rate for our redemption,
   and it did that which in temporal, civil redemption is done by silver
   and gold, which are given as a valuable consideration for the captive.
   But what kind of price is this blood of Christ It is lutron, Matt. xx.
   28, that is, a "price of redemption;" whence it is said that "he gave
   himself for us, ina lutrosetai hemas," Tit. ii. 14, "that he might
   fetch us off with a ransom." But it may be that it is called lutron,
   not that he put himself in our stead, and underwent what was due to us,
   but that his death was as it were a price, because thereon we were
   delivered. Nay, but his life was lutron properly; and therefore he
   calls it also antilutron, 1 Tim. ii. 6. Anti in composition signifies
   either opposition, as 1 Pet. iii. 9, or substitution and commutation,
   as Matt. ii. 22. In the first sense, here it cannot be taken; therefore
   it must be in the latter. He was antilutron, -- that is, did so pay a
   ransom that he himself became that which we should have been; as it is
   expressed, Gal. iii. 13, "He redeemed us from the curse of the law,
   being made a curse for us." To whom he paid this price was before
   declared, and the apostle expresseth it, Eph. v. 2. What now is the
   issue of all this? We have redemption thereby: Chap. i. 7, "In whom we
   have apolutrosin dia tou haimatos autou, -- redemption by his blood;"
   as it is again asserted in the same words, Col. i. 14. But how came we
   by this redemption? He obtained it of God for us: "He entered into
   heaven, aionian lutrosin heuramenos, having found (or obtained) eternal
   redemption for us." By the price of his blood he procured this
   deliverance at the hand of God. And that we may know that this effect
   of the death of Christ is properly towards God, what is the immediate
   issue of this redemption is expressed. It is "forgiveness of sins,"
   Eph. i. 7; Col. i. 14; Rom. iii. 24, 25.

   And this is as much as is needful to the first notion of the death of
   Christ, as a price and ransom, with the issues of it, and the
   confirmation of our first argument from thence for the satisfaction of
   Christ.

Chapter XXIX.

   Of reconciliation by the death of Christ as it is a sacrifice.

   II. The next consideration of the death of Christ is of it as a
   sacrifice, and the proper effect thereof is reconciliation by his death
   as a sacrifice.

   Reconciliation in general is the renewal of lost friendship and peace
   between persons at variance. To apply this to the matter treated of,
   the ensuing positions are to be premised:--

   1. There was at first, in the state of innocency, friendship and peace
   between God and man. God had no enmity against his creature; he
   approved him to be good, and appointed him to walk in peace, communion,
   confidence, and boldness with him, Gen. ii.. Nor had man, on whose
   heart the law and love of his Maker was written, any enmity against his
   Creator, God, and Rewarder.

   2. That by sin there is division, separation, and breach of peace and
   friendship, introduced between God and the creature: Isa. lix. 2, "Your
   iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have
   hid his face from you." Chap. lxiii. 10, "They rebelled, and vexed his
   holy Spirit; therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and fought
   against them." Chap. lvii. 21, "There is no peace, saith my God, to the
   wicked." And therefore it is that, upon a delivery from this condition,
   we are said (and not before) to have "peace with God," Rom. v. 1.

   3. That by this breach of peace and friendship with God, God was
   alienated from the sinner, so as to be angry with him, and to renounce
   all peace and friendship with him, considered as such and in that
   condition. "He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him,"
   John iii. 36.

   And therefore by nature and in our natural condition we are "children
   of wrath," Eph. ii. 3; that is, obnoxious to the wrath of God, that
   abides upon unbelievers, -- that is, unreconciled persons.

   4. This enmity on the part of God consists, --

   (1.) In the purity and holiness of his nature, whence he cannot admit a
   guilty, defiled creature to have any communion with him. He is a God of
   "purer eyes than to behold evil," Hab. i. 13. And sinners cannot serve
   him, because "he is a holy God, a jealous God, that will not forgive
   their transgressions nor their sins," Josh. xxiv. 19.

   (2.) In his will of punishing for sin: Rom. i. 32, "It is the judgment
   of God, that they which commit sin are worthy of death," and this from
   the righteousness of the thing itself. 2 Thess. i. 6, "It is a
   righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation" to sinner. "He is
   not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness," etc., Ps. v. 4-6.

   (3.) In the sentence of his law, in the establishing and execution
   whereof his truth and honour were engaged: "In the day that thou cutest
   thereof, thou shalt surely die," Gen. ii. 17. And, "Cursed is every one
   that continueth not," etc., Gal. iii. 13, Deut. xxvii. 26. And of this
   enmity of God against sin and sinners, as I have elsewhere at large
   declared, there is an indelible persuasion abiding on the hearts of all
   the sons of men, however, by the stirrings of lust and craft of Satan,
   it may be more or less blotted in them. Hence, --

   (4.) As a fruit and evidence of this enmity, God abominates their
   persons, Ps. i. 4-6; rejects and hates their duties and ways, Prov. xv.
   8, 9; and prepares wrath and vengeance for them, to be inflicted in his
   appointed time, Rom. ii. 5; -- all which make up perfect enmity on the
   part of God.

   5. That man was at enmity with God as on his part, I shall not need to
   prove, because I am not treating of our reconciliation to God, but of
   his reconciliation to us.

   Where there is such an enmity as this, begun by offence on the one
   part, and continued by anger and purpose to punish on the other, to
   make reconciliation is properly to propitiate and turn away the anger
   of the person offended, and thereby to bring the offender into favour
   with him again, and to an enjoyment of the same, or a friendship built
   on better conditions than the former. This description of
   reconciliation doth God himself give us, Job xlii. 7-9, "And it was so,
   that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord said to
   Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy
   two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as
   my servant Job hath. Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and
   seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a
   burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I
   accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not
   spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job," etc. The
   offenders are Eliphaz and his two friends; the offence is their folly
   in not speaking aright of God; the issue of the breach is, that the
   wrath or anger of God was towards them. Reconciliation is the turning
   away of that wrath. The means whereby this was to be done, appointed of
   God, is the sacrifice of Job for atonement.

   This, then, is that which we ascribe to the death of Christ when we say
   that, as a sacrifice, we were reconciled to God by it, or that he made
   reconciliation for us. Having made God our enemy by sin (as before),
   Christ by his death turned away his anger, appeased his wrath, and
   brought us into favour again with God. Before the proof of this, I must
   needs give one caution as to some terms of this discourse, as also
   remove an objection that lies at the very entrance against the whole
   nature of that which is treated of.

   For the first, When we speak of the anger of God, his wrath, and his
   being appeased towards us, we speak after the manner of men; but yet by
   the allowance of God himself. Not that God is properly angry, and
   properly altered from that state and appeased, whereby he should
   properly be mutable and be actually changed; -- but by the anger of
   God, which sometimes in Scripture signifieth his justice, from whence
   punishment proceeds, sometimes the effects of anger, or punishment
   itself, the obstacles before mentioned on the part of God, from his
   nature, justice, law, and truth, are intended; and by his being
   appeased towards us, his being satisfied as to all the bars so laid in
   the way of receiving us to favour, without the least alteration in him,
   his nature, will, or justice. And according to the analogy hereof, I
   desire that whatever is spoken of the anger of God, and his being
   appeased or altered (which is the language wherein he converseth with
   us and instructs us to wisdom), may be measured and interpreted.

   The objection I shall propose in the words of Crellius:--

   If this be the chiefest and highest love of God, that he sent Christ,
   his only Son, to be a propitiation for our sins, how then could Christ
   by his death appease the wrath of God that was incensed against us? for
   seeing that God's love was the cause of sending Christ, he must needs
   before that have laid aside, his anger; for otherwise, should he not
   intensely love us and not love us at the same time? And if God could
   then be angry with us when he gave up his Son to bitter death for our
   everlasting happiness, what argument or evidence at any time can we
   have from the effect of it, whence we may know that God is not farther
   angry with us? [505]

   To the same purpose Socinus himself: "Demonstravi non modo Christum Deo
   nos, non autem Deum nobis reconciliasse, verum etiam Deum ipsum fuisse
   qui hanc reconciliationem fecerit," Socin. de Servator. lib. i. part.
   i. cap. i.

   To the same purpose is the plea of the catechist, cap. viii., "De Morte
   Christi," q. 31, 32.

   Ans. 1. The love wherewith God loved us when he sent his Son to die for
   us was the most intense and supreme in its own kind, nor would admit of
   any hatred or enmity in God towards us that stood in opposition
   thereunto. It is everywhere set forth as the most intense love, John
   iii. 16; Rom. v. 7, 8, 1 John iv. 10. Now, this love of God is an
   eternal free act of his will; his "purpose," Rom. ix. 11; "his good
   pleasure," his purpose that he "purposed in himself," as it is called,
   Eph. i. 5, 9; it is his prothesis eudokia prognosis, 1 Pet. i. 2, as I
   have elsewhere distinctly declared; a love that was to have an efficacy
   by means appointed. But for a love of friendship, approbation,
   acceptation as to our persons and duties, God bears none unto us, but
   as considered in Christ and for his sake. It is contrary to the whole
   design of the Scripture and innumerable particular testimonies once to
   fancy a love of friendship and acceptation towards any in God, and not
   consequent to the death of Christ.

   2. This love of God's purpose and good pleasure, this "charitas
   ordinativa," hath not the least inconsistency with those hinderances of
   peace and friendship on the part of God before mentioned; for though
   the holiness of God's nature, the justice of his government, the
   veracity of his word, will not allow that he take a sinner into
   friendship and communion with himself without satisfaction made to him,
   yet this hinders not but that, in his sovereign good-will and pleasure,
   he might purpose to recover us from that condition by the holy means
   which he appointed. God did not love us and not love us, or was angry
   with us, at the same time and in the same respect. He loved us in
   respect of the free purpose of his will to send Christ to redeem us and
   to satisfy for our sin; he was angry with us in respect of his violated
   law and provoked justice by sin.

   3. God loves our persons as we are his creatures, is angry with us as
   we are sinners.

   4. It is true that we can have no greater evidence and argument of the
   love of God's good-will and pleasure in general than in sending his Son
   to die for sinners, and that he is not angry with them with an anger of
   hatred opposite to that love, -- that is, with an eternal purpose to
   destroy them; but for a love of friendship and acceptation, we have
   innumerable other pledges and evidences, as is known, and might be
   easily declared.

   These things being premised, the confirmation of what was proposed
   ensues:--

   The use and sense of the words whereby this doctrine of our
   reconciliation is expressed evince the truth contended for.
   Hilaskesthai, katalassein, and apokatalassein, which are the words used
   in this business, are as much as "iram avertere," "to turn away anger:"
   so is "reconciliare, propitiare," and "placare," in Latin. "Impius, ne
   audeto placare iram deorum," was a law of the Twelve Tables.
   Hilaskomai, "propitior, placor," hilasmos, "placatio, exoratio," Gloss.
   vetus. And in this sense is the word used: Hosa mentoi pros hilasmous
   theon e teraton apotropas sunegoreuon hoi manteis, Plut. in Fabio, --
   to "appease their gods, and turn away the things they feared." And the
   same author tells us of a way taken exilasasthai to menima tes theou,
   -- to "appease the anger of the goddess" And Xenophon useth the word to
   the same purpose: Polla men pempon anathemata chrusa polla de argura
   pampolla de thuon exilasamen pote auton. And so also doth Livy use the
   word "reconcilio:" "Non movit modo talis oratio regem, sed etiam
   reconciliavit Annibali," Bell. Macedon. And many more instances might
   be given. God, then, being angry and averse from love of friendship
   with us, as hath been declared, and Christ being said thus to make
   reconciliation for us with God, he did fully turn away the wrath of God
   from us, as by the testimonies of it will appear.

   Before I produce our witnesses in this cause, I must give this one
   caution: It is not said anywhere expressly that God is reconciled to
   us, but that we are reconciled to God; and the sole reason thereof is,
   because he is the party offended, and we are the parties offending.
   Now, the party offending is always said to be reconciled to the party
   offended, and not on the contrary. So Matt. v. 23, 24, "If thy brother
   have ought against thee, go and be reconciled to him." The brother
   being the party offended, he that had offended was to be reconciled to
   him by turning away his anger. And in common speech, when one hath
   justly provoked another, we bid him go and reconcile himself to him;
   that is, do that which may appease him and give an entrance into his
   favour again. So is it in the case under consideration. Being the
   parties offending, we are said to be reconciled to God when his anger
   is turned away and we are admitted into his favour. Let now the
   testimonies speak for themselves:--

   Rom. v. 10, "When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
   death of his Son." Katellagemen to Theo, -- "We were reconciled to
   God," or "brought again into his favour." Amongst the many reasons that
   might be given to prove the intention of this expression to be, "that
   we were reconciled to God" by the averting of his anger from us, and
   our accepting into favour, I shall insist on some few from the
   context:--

   1. It appears from the relation that this expression bears to that of
   verse 8, "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us," with which
   this upon the matter is the same, "We are reconciled to God by the
   death of his Son." Now, the intent of this expression, "Christ died for
   us sinners," is, he died to bring us sinners into the favour of God,
   nor will it admit of any other sense; so is our being "reconciled to
   God by the death of his Son." And that this is the meaning of the
   expression, "Christ died for us," is evident from the illustration
   given to it by the apostle, verses 6, 7. "Christ died for the ungodly;"
   how? As one man dieth for another, -- that is, to deliver him from
   death.

   2. From the description of the same thing in other words: Verse 9,
   "Being justified by his blood." That it is the same thing upon the
   matter that is here intended appears from the contexture of the
   apostle's speech, "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us; much
   more then being justified by his blood;" and, "If, when we were
   enemies, we were reconciled to God." The apostle repeats what he had
   said before, "If, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us," and
   "we were justified by the blood of Christ;" that is, "If, when we were
   enemies, we were reconciled to God." Now, to be justified is God's
   reconciliation to us, his acceptation of us into favour, not our
   conversion to him, as is known and confessed.

   3. The reconciliation we have with God is a thing tendered to us, and
   we do receive it: Verse 11, Katallagen elabomen, "We have received the
   reconciliation (or atonement)." Now, this cannot be spoken in reference
   to our reconciliation to God as on our side, but of his to us, and our
   acceptation with him. Our reconciliation to God is our conversion; but
   we are not said to receive our conversion, or to have our conversion
   tendered to us, but to convert ourselves or to be converted.

   4. The state and condition from whence we are delivered by this
   reconciliation is described in this, that we are called enemies, --
   being "enemies, we were reconciled." Now, enemies in this place are the
   same with sinners; and the reconciliation of sinners, -- that is, of
   those who had rebelled against God, provoked him, were obnoxious to
   wrath, -- is certainly the procuring of the favour of God for them.
   When you say, "Such a poor, conquered rebel, that expected to be
   tortured and slain, is by means of such a one reconciled to his
   prince," what is it that you intend? Is it that he begins to like and
   love his prince only, or that his prince lays down his wrath and
   pardons him?

   5. All the considerations before insisted on, declaring in what sense
   we are saved by the death of Christ, prove our reconciliation with God
   to be our acceptation with him, not our conversion to him.

   2 Cor. v. 18-21 is a place of the same importance with that above
   mentioned, wherein the reconciliation pleaded for is asserted, and the
   nature of it explained: "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled
   us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
   reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world
   to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed
   unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for
   Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's
   stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us,
   who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in
   him."

   There is in these words a twofold reconciliation:-- 1. Of God to man:
   Verse 18, "God hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ." 2. Our
   reconciliation to God, in the acceptance of that reconciliation which
   we are exhorted to.

   The first is that inquired after, the reconciliation whereby the anger
   of God by Christ is turned away, and those for whom he died are brought
   into his favour, which comprises the satisfaction proposed to
   confirmation; for, --

   1. Unless it be that God is so reconciled and atoned, whence is it that
   he is thus proclaimed to be a Father towards sinners, as he is here
   expressed? Out of Christ he is a "consuming fire" to sinners and
   "everlasting burnings," Isa. xxxiii. 14, being of "purer eyes than to
   behold evil," Hab. i. 13; before whom no sinner shall appear or stand,
   Ps. v. 4, 5. So that, where there is no "sacrifice for sins," there
   "remaineth nothing to sinners but a certain fearful looking for of
   judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries,"
   Heb. x. 26, How comes, then, this jealous God, this holy God and just
   Judge, to command some to beseech sinners to be reconciled to him? The
   reason is given before. It is because he reconciles us to himself by
   Christ, or in Christ; that is, by Christ his anger is pacified, his
   justice satisfied, and himself appeased or reconciled to us.

   2. The reconciliation mentioned is so expounded, in the cause and
   effect of it, as not to admit of any other interpretation.

   (1.) The effect of God's being reconciled, or his reconciling the world
   to himself, is in these words, "Not imputing to them their trespasses."
   God doth so reconcile us to himself by Christ as not to impute our
   trespasses to us; that is, not dealing with us according as justice
   required for our sins, upon the account of Christ's [work] remitting
   the penalty due to them, laying away his anger, and receiving us to
   favour. This is the immediate fruit of the reconciliation spoken of, if
   not the reconciliation itself. Nonimputation of sin is not our
   conversion to God.

   (2.) The cause of it is expressed, verse 21, "He made him to be sin for
   us, who knew no sin." How comes it to pass that God, the righteous
   judge, doth thus reconcile us to himself, and not impute to us our
   sins? It is because he hath made Christ to be sin for us:-- that is,
   either a sacrifice for sin, or as sin, -- by the imputation of our sin
   to him. He was "made sin for us," as we are "made the righteousness of
   God in him." Now, we are made the righteousness of God by the
   imputation of his righteousness to us: so was he made sin for us by the
   imputation of our sin to him. Now, for God to reconcile us to himself
   by imputing our sin to Christ, and thereon not imputing it to us, can
   be nothing but his being appeased and atoned towards us, with his
   receiving us into his favour, by and upon the account of the death of
   Christ.

   (3.) This reconciling of us to himself is the matter committed to the
   preachers of the gospel; whereby, or by the declaration whereof, they
   should persuade us to be reconciled to God. "He hath committed to us
   ton logon tes katallages, this doctrine concerning reconciliation
   mentioned, we therefore beseech you to be reconciled to God.'?" That
   which is the matter whereby we are persuaded to be reconciled to God
   cannot be our conversion itself, as is pretended. The preachers of the
   gospel are to declare this word of God, namely, "that he hath
   reconciled us to himself" by the blood of Christ, the blood of the new
   testament that was shed for us, and thereon persuade us to accept of
   the tidings, or the subject of them, and to be at peace with God. Can
   the sense be, "We are converted to God, therefore be ye converted?"
   This testimony, then, speaks clearly to the matter under debate.

   The next place of the same import is Eph. ii. 12-16, "At that time ye
   were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
   strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without
   God in the world: but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off
   are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who hath
   made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition
   between us; having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
   commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain
   one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God
   in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby."

   1. Here is mention of a twofold enmity: -- (1.) Of the Gentiles unto
   God; (2.) Of the Jews and Gentiles among themselves.

   (1.) Of the Gentiles unto God, verse 12. Consider them as they are
   there described, and their enmity to God is sufficiently evident. And
   what in that estate was the respect of God unto them? what is it
   towards such persons as there described? "The wrath of God abideth on
   them," John iii. 36; they are "children of wrath," Eph. ii. 3. So are
   they there expressly called. "He hateth all the workers of iniquity,"
   Ps. v. 5, and "will by no means clear the guilty," Exod. xxxiv. 7; yea,
   he curseth those families that call not on his name, Jer. x. 25.

   (2.) Of the Jews and Gentiles among themselves; which is expressed both
   in the thing itself and in the cause of it. It is called "enmity," and
   said to arise from, or be occasioned and improved by, "the law of
   commandments contained in ordinances." The occasion, improvement, and
   management of this enmity between them see elsewhere.

   2. Here is mention of a twofold reconciliation:-- (1.) Of the Jews and
   Gentiles among themselves: Verses 14, 15, "He is our peace, who hath
   made both one, abolishing the enmity, so making peace." (2.) Of both
   unto God: Verse 16, "That he might reconcile both unto God."

   3. The manner whereby this reconciliation was wrought: "In his body, by
   the cross."

   The reconciliation unto God is that aimed at. This reconciliation is
   the reconciling of God unto us on the account of the blood of Christ,
   as hath been declared, -- the bringing of us into his favour by the
   laying away of his wrath and enmity against us: which appears, --

   (1.) From the cause of it expressed; that is, the body of Christ, by
   the cross, or the death of Christ. Now, the death of Christ was
   immediately for the forgiveness of sins: "This is my blood of the new
   testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins." It is by
   shedding of his blood that we have remission or forgiveness. That this
   is by an atoning of God, or our acceptance into favour, is confessed.

   (2.) From the expression itself: Apokatallaxe en heni somati to Theo.
   To Theo denotes one party in the business of reconciliation. He made
   peace between them both, between the Gentiles on the one hand and the
   Jews on the other, and he made peace between them both and God, Jews
   and Gentiles on the one hand and God on the other. So that God is a
   party in the business of reconciliation, and is therein reconciled to
   us; for our reconciliation to him is mentioned in our reconciliation
   together, which cannot be done without our conversion.

   (3.) From the description of the enmity given, verse 12, which plainly
   shows (as was manifested) that it was on both sides. Now, this
   reconciliation unto God is by the removal of that enmity; and if so,
   God was thereby reconciled and atoned, if he hath any anger or
   indignation against sin or sinners.

   (4.) Because this reconciliation of both to God is the great cause and
   means of their reconciliation among themselves. God, through the blood
   of Christ, or on the account of his death, receiving both into favour,
   their mutual enmity ceased; and without it never did nor ever will.

   And this is the reconciliation accomplished by Christ.

   The same might be said of the other place, Col. i. 20-22; but I shall
   not need to multiply testimonies to the same purpose. Thus we have
   reconciliation by Christ, in that he hath made atonement or
   satisfaction for our sins.

   The observations given on these texts have been suited to obviate the
   exceptions of Socinus, treating of this subject in his book "De
   Servatore," without troubling the reader with the repetition of his
   words.

   That which in the next place I thought to do is, to prove that we have
   this reconciliation by the death of Christ as a sacrifice. But because
   I cannot do this to my own satisfaction without insisting, first, on
   the whole doctrine of sacrifices in general; secondly, on the
   institution, nature, end, and efficacy of the sacrifices of the
   Aaronical priesthood; thirdly, the respect and relation that was
   between them and the sacrifice of Christ, both in general and in
   particular; and from all these considerations at large deducing the
   conclusion proposed; -- and finding that this procedure would draw out
   this treatise to a length utterly beyond my expectation, I shall not
   proceed in it, but refer it to a peculiar discourse on that subject.

   That which I proposed to confirmation at the entrance of this discourse
   was the satisfaction made by the blood of Christ. This being proposed
   under several considerations, hath thus far been severally handled.
   That his death was a price, that we have redemption thereby properly so
   called, was first evinced. That truth standing, the satisfaction of
   Christ is sufficiently established, our adversaries themselves being
   judges The sacrifice that he offered in his death hath also been
   manifested. Hereof is the reconciliation now delivered the fruit and
   effect. This also is no less destructive of the design of these men.
   What they have to object against that which hath been spoken shall have
   the next place in our discourse:--

   Thus, then, our catechists to this business, in the 31st and 32d
   questions of the 8th chapter, which is about the death of Christ:--

   Q. What say you, then, to those places that affirm that he reconciled
   us to God?

   A. 1. That the Scripture nowhere says that God was reconciled to us by
   Christ, but this only, that by Christ, or the death of Christ, we are
   reconciled, or reconciled to God; as may appear from all those places
   where reconciliation is treated of: wherefore from those places the
   satisfaction cannot be proved. 2. Because it is evident in the
   Scripture that God reconciled us to himself, which evinceth the opinion
   of the adversaries to be altogether false, 2 Cor. v. 18, Col. i. 20-22.
   [506]

   Ans. 1. Whether there be any mention in the Scripture of such a
   reconciliation as whereby the anger of God is turned away and we
   received into favour, the reader will judge from what hath been already
   proposed, and thither we appeal. It is not about words and syllables
   that we contend, but things themselves. The reconciliation of God to us
   by Christ is so expressed as the reconciliation of a judge to an
   offender, of a king to a rebel, may be expressed.

   2. If Christ made reconciliation for us and for our sins an atonement,
   he made the satisfaction for us which we plead for.

   3. It is true, God is said to reconcile us to himself, but always by
   Christ, by the blood of Christ, proposing himself as reconciled
   thereby, and declaring to us the atonement that we may turn unto him.

   They add --

   Q. But what thinkest thou of this reconciliation?

   A. That Jesus Christ showed a way to us, who by reason of our sins were
   enemies to God and alienated from him, how we ought to turn unto God,
   and by that means be reconciled to him. [507]

   Ans. I suppose there was never a more perverse description of any
   thing, part or parcel, of the gospel by any men fixed on. Some of the
   excellencies of it may be pointed out:--

   1. Here is a reconciliation between two parties, and yet a
   reconciliation but of one, the other excluded.

   2. An enmity on one side only, between God and sinners, is supposed,
   and that on the part of the sinners, when the Scriptures do much more
   abound in setting out the enmity of God against them as such, his wrath
   abiding on them, -- as some will find one day to their eternal sorrow.

   3. Reconciliation is made nothing but conversion, or conversion to God,
   which yet are terms and things in the Scriptures everywhere
   distinguished.

   4. We are said to be enemies to God "propter peccata nostra," when the
   Scripture says everywhere that God is an enemy to us "propter peccata
   nostra." He hateth and is angry with sinners His judgment is, "that
   they which commit sin are worthy of death," Rom. i. 32.

   5. Here is no mention of the death and blood of Christ, which, in every
   place in the whole Scripture where this reconciliation is spoken of, is
   expressly laid down as the cause of it, and necessarily denotes the
   reconciliation of God to us, by the averting of his anger, as the
   effect of it.

   6. Did Christ by his death show us a way whereby we might come to be
   reconciled to God or convert ourselves? What was that way? Is it that
   God lays punishment, and affliction, and death, on them who are no way
   liable thereunto? What else can we learn from the death of Christ,
   according to these men? The truth is, they mention not his death,
   because they know not how to make their ends hang together.

   This is the sum of what they say: "We are reconciled to God, that is,
   we convert ourselves, by the death of Christ; that is, not by his
   death, but according to the doctrine he teacheth. And this is the sum
   of the doctrine of reconciliation: Christ teacheth us a way how we
   should convert ourselves to God." And so much for reconciliation.

Chapter XXX.

   The satisfaction of Christ on the consideration of his death being a
   punishment farther evinced, and vindicated from the exceptions of
   Smalcius.

   III. The third consideration of the death of Christ was of it as it was
   penal, as therein he underwent punishment for us, or that punishment
   which for sin was due to us. Thence directly is it said to be
   satisfactory. About the word itself we do not contend, nor do our
   adversaries except against it. If the thing itself be proved that is
   intended by that expression, this controversy is at end. Farther to
   open the nature of satisfaction, then, by what is said before about
   bearing of sins, etc., I see no reason; our aim in that word is known
   to all, and the sense of it obvious. This is made by some the general
   head of the whole business. I have placed it on the peculiar
   consideration of Christ's bearing our sins and undergoing punishment
   for us. What our catechists say to the whole I shall briefly consider.

   Having assigned some causes and effects of the death of Christ, partly
   true in their own place, partly false, they ask, question 12, --

   Ques. Is there no other cause of the death of Christ?

   Ans. None at all. As for that which Christians commonly think, that
   Christ by his death merited salvation for us, and satisfied fully for
   our sins, that opinion is false (or deceitful), erroneous, and very
   pernicious. [508]

   That the men of this persuasion are bold men we are not now to learn;
   only, this assertion, that there is no other cause of the death of
   Christ but what they have mentioned, is a new experiment thereof.

   If we must believe that these men know all things and the whole mind of
   God, so that all is "false and pernicious" that lies beyond their road
   and understanding, there may be some colour for this confidence; but
   the account we have already taken of them will not allow us to grant
   them this plea.

   Of the merit of Christ I have spoken briefly before. His satisfaction
   is the thing opposed chiefly. What they have to say against it shall
   now be considered; as also, how this imputation or charge on the common
   faith of Christians, about the satisfaction of Christ to be "false,
   erroneous, and pernicious," will be managed.

   Q. How is it false (or deceitful)?

   A. That it is false (or deceitful) and erroneous is hence evident, that
   not only there is nothing of it extant in the Scripture, but also that
   it is repugnant to the Scriptures and sound reason. [509]

   For the truth of this suggestion, that it is not extant in Scripture, I
   refer the reader to what hath been discoursed from the Scripture about
   it already. When they, or any for them, shall answer or evade the
   testimonies that have been produced, or may yet be so (for I have yet
   mentioned none of those which immediately express the dying of Christ
   for us, and his being our mediator and surety in his death), they shall
   have liberty, for me, to boast in this manner. In the meantime, we are
   not concerned in their wretched confidence. But let us see how they
   make good their assertion by instances:--

   Q. Show that in order?

   A. That it is not in the Scripture this is an argument, that the
   assertors of that opinion do never bring evident scriptures for the
   proof of it, but knit certain consequences by which they endeavour to
   make good what they assert; which as it is meet to admit when they are
   necessarily deduced from Scripture, so it is certain they have no force
   when they are repugnant to the Scripture. [510]

   But what is it that we do not prove by express Scripture, and that in
   abundance? That "our iniquity was laid upon Christ;" that "he was
   bruised, grieved, wounded, killed for us;" that "he bare our
   iniquities," and that "in his own body on the tree;" that "he was made
   sin for us" and "a curse;" that we deserved death, and "he died for
   us;" that "he made his soul an offering for sin, laid down his life a
   price and ransom for us," or in our stead; that we are thereby
   "redeemed and reconciled to God;" that our "iniquities being laid on
   him," and he "bearing them" (that is, the punishment due to them), "we
   have deliverance;" God being atoned, and his wrath removed, -- we prove
   not by consequence, but by multitudes of express testimonies. If they
   mean that the word "satisfaction" is not found in Scripture in the
   business treated of, we tell them that 'sm? is; and lutron antilutron,
   and lutrosis apolutrosis katallage (all words of a cognate significancy
   thereto, and of the same importance as to the doctrine under
   consideration), are frequently used. It is, indeed, a hard task to find
   the word satisfaction in the Hebrew of the Old Testament or the Greek
   of the New; but the thing itself is found expressly a hundred times
   over; and their great master doth confess that it is not the word, but
   the thing itself, that he opposeth. So that, without any thanks to them
   at all for granting that consequences from Scripture may be allowed to
   prove matters of faith, we assure them our doctrine is made good by
   innumerable express testimonies of the word of God, some whereof have
   been by us now insisted on; and, moreover, that if they and their
   companions did not wrest the Scriptures to strange and uncouth senses,
   never heard of before amongst men professing the name of Christ, we
   could willingly abstain wholly from any expression that is not rhetos,
   found in the Word itself. But if, by their rebellion against the truth,
   and attempts to pervert all the expressions of the Word, the most clear
   and evident, to perverse and horrid abominations, we are necessitated
   to them, they must bear them, unless they can prove them not to be
   true.

   Let the reader observe, that they grant that the consequences we gather
   from Scripture would evince that which we plead and contend for, were
   it not that they are repugnant to other scriptures. Let them, then,
   manifest the truth of their pretension by producing those other
   scriptures, or confess that they are self-condemned.

   Wherefore they ask, --

   Q. How is it repugnant to the Scriptures?

   A. In this sort, that the Scriptures do everywhere testify that God
   forgives sin freely, 2 Cor. v. 19, Rom. iii. 24, 25; but principally
   under the new covenant, Eph. ii. 8, Matt. xviii. 23, etc. Now, nothing
   is more opposite to free remission than satisfaction; so that if a
   creditor be satisfied either by the debtor himself or by any other in
   the name of the debtor, he cannot be said to forgive freely. [511]

   If this be all that our consequences are repugnant unto in the
   Scripture, we doubt not to make a speedy reconciliation; indeed there
   was never the least difference between them. Not to dwell long upon
   that which is of an easy despatch, --

   1. This objection is stated solely to the consideration of sin as a
   debt, which is metaphorical. Sin properly is an offence, a rebellion, a
   transgression of the law, an injury done, not to a private person, but
   to a governor in his government.

   2. The first two places mentioned, 2 Cor. v. 18-20, Rom. iii. 24, 25,
   do expressly mention the payment of this debt by Christ as the ground
   of God's forgiveness, remission, and pardon; the payment of it, I say,
   not as considered metaphorically as a debt, but the making an atonement
   and reconciliation for us who had committed it, considered as a crime
   and rebellion or transgression.

   3. We say that God doth most freely forgive us, as Eph. ii. 8, Matt.
   xviii. 23, etc., without requiring any of the debt at our hands,
   without requiring any price or ransom from us or any satisfaction at
   our hands; but yet he forgives us for Christ's sake, setting forth him
   to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, he laying down his
   life a ransom for us, God not sparing him, but giving him up to death
   for us all.

   4. The expression of another satisfying in the name of the debtor
   intends either one procured by the debtor, and at his entreaty
   undertaking the work, or one graciously given and assigned to be in his
   stead by the creditor, In the first sense it hath an inconsistency with
   free remission, in the latter not at all.

   The truth is, men that dream of an opposition between the satisfaction
   made by Christ, the surety and mediator of the new covenant, and free
   remission made to us, are utterly ignorant of the whole mystery of the
   gospel, nature of the covenant, and whole mediation of Christ,
   advancing carnal imaginations against innumerable testimonies of the
   Scripture, witnessing the blessed conspiration between them, to the
   praise of the glorious grace of God. But they say:--

   That it is contrary to reason also, because it would hence follow "that
   Christ underwent eternal death, if he satisfied God for our sins,
   seeing it is manifest that the punishment we deserved by our sins was
   eternal death. Also, it would follow that we should be more bound to
   Christ than to God himself, as to him who had shown us greater favour
   in satisfaction; but God receiving satisfaction afforded us no favour."
   [512]

   What little relief this plea will afford our adversaries will quickly
   appear; for, --

   1. I have proved that Christ underwent that death that was due unto
   sinners, which was all that justice, law, or reason required. He
   underwent it, though it was impossible for him to be detained by it.

   2. If the Racovians do not think us obliged to God for sending his Son,
   out of his infinite and eternal love, to die for us, causing all our
   iniquities to meet on him, justifying us freely (who could do nothing
   for our own delivery) through the redemption that is in the blood of
   Christ, we must tell them that (we bless his holy name!) we are not of
   that mind, but, finding a daily fruit of his love and kindness upon our
   souls, do know that we are bound unto him eternally, to love, praise,
   serve, honour, and glorify him, beyond what we shall ever be able to
   express.

   For the inquiry made and comparison instituted between our obligation
   to the Father and the Son, or which of them we are most beholden to, we
   profess we cannot speak unto it. Our obligation to both, and either
   respectively, is such that if our affections were extended immeasurably
   to what they are, yet the utmost and exactest height of them would be
   due to both, and each of them respectively. We are so bound to one as
   we cannot be more to the other, because to both in the absolutely
   highest degree. This we observe in the Scriptures, that in mentioning
   the work of redemption, the rise, fountain, and spring of it is still
   assigned to be in the love of the Father, the carrying of it on in the
   love and obedience of the Son, and so we order our thoughts of faith
   towards them; the Father being not one whit the less free and gracious
   to us by loving us upon the satisfaction of his Son than if he had
   forgiven us (had it been possible) without any satisfaction at all.

   And thus is this article of the Christian faith contrary to Scripture,
   and to reason. They add:--

   Q. How also is it pernicious?

   A. In that it openeth a door unto men to sin, or at least incites them
   to sloth in following after holiness. But the Scripture witnesseth that
   this amongst others is an end of the death of Christ, that he might
   redeem us from all iniquity, and deliver us from this evil world, that
   we might be redeemed from our vain conversation, and have our
   consciences purged from dead works, that we might serve the living God,
   Tit. ii. 14; Gal. i. 4; 1 Pet. i. 18; Heb. ix.14. [513]

   That the deliverance of us from the power and pollution of our sin, the
   purifying of our souls and consciences, the making of us a peculiar
   people of God, zealous of good works, that we might be holy and
   blameless before him in love, is one eminent end of the death of
   Christ, we grant. For this end, by his death, did he procure the Spirit
   to quicken us, "who were dead in trespasses and sins," sprinkling us
   with the pure water thereof, and giving us daily supplies of grace from
   him, that we might grow up in holiness before him, until we come to the
   measure in this life assigned to us in him. But that the consideration
   of the cross of Christ, and the satisfaction made thereby, should open
   a door of licentiousness to sin, or encourage men to sloth in the ways
   of godliness, is fit only for them to assert to whom the gospel is
   folly.

   What is it, I pray, in the doctrine of the cross that should thus
   dispose men to licentiousness and sloth? Is it that God is so provoked
   with every sin that it is impossible and against his nature to forgive
   it without inflicting the punishment due thereto? or is it that God so
   loved us that he gave his only Son to die for us? or is it that Christ
   loved us and washed us in his own blood? or is it that God for Christ's
   sake doth freely forgive us? Yea, but our adversaries say that God
   freely forgives us; yea, but they say it is without satisfaction. Is
   it, then, an encouragement to sin to affirm that God forgives us freely
   for the satisfaction of his Son, and not so to say that he forgives us
   freely without satisfaction? Doth the adding of satisfaction, whereby
   God to the highest manifested his indignation and wrath against sin,
   doth that, I say, make the difference and give the encouragement? Who
   could have discovered this but our catechists and their companions!
   Were this a season for that purpose, I could easily demonstrate that
   there is no powerful or effectual motive to abstain from sin, no
   encouragement or incitation unto holiness, but what ariseth from or
   relateth unto the satisfaction of Christ.

   And this is that which they have to make good their charge against the
   common faith, that "it is false, erroneous, and pernicious"! Such
   worthy foundations have they of their great superstruction, or rather
   so great is their confidence and so little is their strength for the
   pulling down of the church built upon the Rock!

   They proceed to consider what testimonies and proofs (they say) we
   produce for the confirmation of the truth contended for. What (they
   say) we pretend from reason (though indeed it be from innumerable
   places of Scripture), I have vindicated not long since to the full in
   my book of the vindictive justice of God, [514] and answered all the
   exceptions given thereunto, so that I shall not translate from thence
   what I have delivered to this purpose, but pass to what follows.

   Question 12 they make this inquiry:--

   Q. Which are the scriptures out of which they endeavour to confirm
   their opinion?

   A. Those which testify that Christ died for us, or for our sins, also
   that he redeemed us, or that he gave himself or his life a redemption
   for many; then that he is our mediator; moreover, that he reconciled us
   to God, and is a propitiation for our sins; lastly, from those
   sacrifices which, as figures, shadowed forth the death of Christ. [515]

   So do they huddle up together those very many express testimonies of
   the truth we plead for which are recorded in the Scripture; of which I
   may truly say that I know no one truth in the whole Scripture that is
   so freely and fully delivered, as being, indeed, of the greatest
   importance to our souls. What they except in particular against any one
   of the testimonies that may be referred to the heads before recounted
   (except those which have been already spoken to) shall be considered in
   the order wherein they proceed.

   They say, then:--

   For what belongeth unto those testimonies wherein it is contended that
   Christ died for us, it is manifest that satisfaction cannot necessarily
   be therein asserted, because the Scripture witnesseth that we ought
   even to lay down our lives for the brethren,1 John iii. 16; and Paul
   writes of himself, Col. i. 24, "Now I rejoice in my affliction for you,
   and fill up the remainder of the affliction of Christ for his body,
   which is the church:" but it is certain that neither do believers
   satisfy for any of the brethren, nor did Paul make satisfaction to any
   for the church.

   Q. What then is the sense of these words, "Christ died for us?"

   A. That these words "for us" do not signify in our place or stead, but
   for us, as the apostle expressly speaks, 1 Cor. viii. 11, which also
   alike places do show, where the Scripture saith that Christ died for
   our sins; which word cannot have this sense, that Christ died instead
   of our sins, but that he died for our sins, as it is expressly written,
   Rom. iv. 25. Moreover, these words, "Christ died for us," have this
   sense, that he therefore died, that we might embrace and obtain that
   eternal salvation which he brought to us from heaven; which how it is
   done you heard before. [516]

   Ans. Briefly to state the difference between us about the meaning of
   this expression, "Christ died for us," I shall give one or two
   observations upon what they deliver, then confirm the common faith, and
   remove their exceptions thereto:--

   1. Without any attempt of proof, they oppose "vice nostri" and "propter
   nos," as contrary and inconsistent, and make this their argument that
   Christ did not die "vice nostri," because he died "propter nos," when
   it is one argument whereby we prove that Christ died in our stead,
   because he died for us in the sense mentioned 1 Cor. viii. 11, where it
   is expressed by dia, because we could no otherwise be brought to the
   end aimed at.

   2. Our sense of the expression is evident from what we insist upon in
   the doctrine in hand. "Christ died for us," -- that is, he underwent
   the death and curse that was due to us, that we might be delivered
   therefrom.

   3. The last words of the catechists are those wherein they strive to
   hide the abomination of their hearts in reference to this business, I
   shall a little lay it open:--

   (1.) Christ, say they, "brought us eternal salvation from heaven;" that
   is, "he preached a doctrine in obedience whereunto we may obtain
   salvation." So did Paul.

   (2.) "He died that we might receive it;" that is, "rather than he would
   deny the truth which he preached, he suffered himself to be put to
   death." So did Paul, and yet he was not crucified for the church.

   (3.) "It is not indeed the death of Christ, but his resurrection, that
   hath an influence into our receiving of his doctrine, and so our
   obtaining salvation."

   And this is the sense of these words, "Christ died for us"!

   For the confirmation of our faith from this expression, "Christ died
   for us," we have, --

   (1.) The common sense and customary usage of humankind as to this
   expression. Whenever one is in danger, and another is said to come and
   die for him that he may be delivered, a substitution is still
   understood. The antipsuchoi of old, as Damon and Pythias, etc., make
   this manifest.

   (2.) The common usage of this expression in Scripture confirms the
   sense insisted on. So David wished that he had died for his son
   Absalom, that is, died in his stead, that he might have lived, 2 Sam.
   xviii. 33. And that supposal of Paul, Rom. v. 7, of one daring to die
   for a good man, relating (as by all expositors on the place is evinced)
   to the practice of some in former days, who, to deliver others from
   death, had given themselves up to that whereunto they were obnoxious,
   confirms the same.

   (3.) The phrase itself of apethane, or apethanen huper hemon, which is
   used, Heb. ii. 9, 1 Pet. i. 21, [517] Rom. v. 6-8, 2 Cor. v. 14,
   sufficiently proves our intention, compared with the use of the
   preposition in other places, especially being farther explained by the
   use of the preposition anti which ever denotes a substitution in the
   same sense and business, Matt. xx. 28, Mark x. 45, 1 Tim. ii. 6. That a
   substitution and commutation is always denoted by this preposition (if
   not an opposition, which here can have no place), 1 Pet. iii. 9, Rom.
   xii. 17, Matt. v. 38, Luke xi. 11, Heb. xii. 16, 1 Cor. xi. 15, amongst
   other places, are sufficient evidences.

   (4.) Christ is so said to die anti hemon, that he is said in his death
   to have "our iniquity laid upon him," to "bear our sins in his own body
   on the tree," to be "made sin and a curse for us," to "offer himself a
   sacrifice for us" by his death, his blood, to "pay a price or ransom
   for us," to "redeem," to "reconcile us to God," to "do away our sins in
   his blood," to "free us from wrath, and condemnation, and sin." Now,
   whether this, to "die for us," be not to die in our place and stead,
   let angels and men judge.

   4. But say they, "This is all that they have to say in this business:
   yet we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren;' and Paul saith,
   that he filled up the measure of the affliction of Christ, for his
   body's sake, the church;' but neither the one nor the other did make
   satisfaction to God by their death or affliction." But, --

   (1.) If all we had to plead for the sense of this expression, "Christ
   died for us," depended solely on the sense and use of that word huper,
   then the exception would have this force in it: "The word is once or
   twice used in another sense in another business; therefore the sense of
   it contended for in this business cannot be such as you seek to
   maintain." But, [1.] This exception at best, in a cause of this
   importance, is most frivolous, and tends to the disturbance of all
   sober interpretation of Scripture. [2.] We are very far from making the
   single sense of the preposition to be the medium which, in the argument
   from the whole expression, we insist on.

   (2.) The passage in 1 John iii. 16, being a part of the apostle's
   persuasive to love, charity, and the fruits of them, tending to the
   relief of the brethren in poverty and distress, disclaims all
   intendment and possibility of a substitution or commutation, nor hath
   any intimation of undergoing that which was due to another, but only of
   being ready to the utmost to assist and relieve them. The same is the
   condition of what is affirmed of Paul. Of the measure of affliction
   which, in the infinitely wise providence and fatherly care of God, is
   proportioned to the mystical body of Christ's church, Paul underwent
   his share for the good of the whole; but that Paul, that any believers,
   were crucified for the church, or died for it in the sense that Christ
   died for it, that they redeemed it to God by their own blood, it is
   notorious blasphemy once to imagine. The meaning of the phrase, "He
   died for our sins," was before explained. Christ, then, "dying for us,"
   being "made sin for us," "bearing our iniquities," and "redeeming us by
   his blood," died in our place and stead, and by his death made
   satisfaction to God for our sins.

   Also, that Christ made satisfaction for our sins appears from hence,
   that he was our mediator. Concerning this, after their attempt against
   proper redemption by his blood, which we have already considered,
   question 28, they inquire, --

   Q. What say you to this, that Christ is the mediator between God and
   men, or [the mediator] of the new covenant?

   A. Seeing it is read that Moses was a mediator, Gal. iii. 19 (namely,
   of the old covenant between God and the people of Israel), and it is
   evident that he no way made satisfaction to God, neither from hence,
   that Christ is the mediator of God and men, can it be certainly
   gathered that he made any satisfaction to God for our sins. [518]

   I shall take leave, before I proceed, to make a return of this argument
   to them from whom it comes, by a mere change of the instance given.
   Christ, they say, our high priest, offered himself to God in heaven.
   Now, Aaron is expressly said to be a high priest, and yet he did not
   offer himself in heaven; and therefore it cannot be certainly proved
   that Christ offereth himself in heaven because he was a high priest. Or
   thus:-- David was a king, and a type of Christ; but David reigned at
   Jerusalem, and was a temporal king: it cannot therefore be proved that
   Christ is a spiritual king from hence, that he is said to be a king.
   This argument, I confess, Faustus Socinus could not answer when it was
   urged against him by Seidelius. But for the former, I doubt not but
   Smalcius would quickly have answered that it is true, it cannot be
   necessarily proved that Christ offereth himself in heaven because he
   was a high priest, which Aaron was also, but because he was such a high
   priest as entered into the heavens to appear personally in the presence
   of God for us, as he is described to be. Until he can give us a better
   answer to our argument, I hope he will be content with this of ours to
   his. It is true, it doth not appear, nor can be evinced necessarily,
   that Christ made satisfaction for us to God because he was a mediator
   in genera], for so Moses was, who made no satisfaction; but because it
   is said that he was such a "mediator between God and men" as gave his
   life a "price of redemption" for them for whom with God he mediated, 1
   Tim. ii. 6, it is most evident and undeniable; and hereunto Smalcius is
   silent.

   What remains of this chapter in the catechists hath been already fully
   considered; so to them and Mr B., as to his twelfth chapter, about the
   death of Christ, what hath been said may suffice. Many weighty
   considerations of the death of Christ in this whole discourse, I
   confess, are omitted, -- and yet more, perhaps, have been delivered
   than by our adversaries occasion hath been administered unto; but this
   business is the very centre of the new covenant, and cannot
   sufficiently be weighed. God assisting, a farther attempt will ere long
   be made for the brief stating of all the several concernments of it.

Chapter XXXI.

   Of election and universal grace -- Of the resurrection of Christ from
   the dead.

   Mr Biddle's intention in this thirteenth chapter being to decry God's
   eternal election, finding himself destitute of any scripture that
   should, to the least outward appearance, speak to his purpose, he
   deserts the way and method of procedure imposed on himself, and in the
   very entrance falls into a dispute against it, with such arguments as
   the texts of Scripture after mentioned give not the least colour or
   countenance unto. Not that from me he incurs any blame for using any
   arguments whereby he supposeth he may further or promote his cause is
   this spoken; but having at the entrance protested against such a
   procedure, he ought not, upon any necessity, to have transgressed the
   law which to himself he had prescribed. But as the matter stands, he is
   to be heard to the full in what he hath to offer. Thus, then, he
   proceeds:--

   Q. Those scriptures which you have already alleged, when I inquired for
   whom Christ died, intimate the universality of God's love to men; yet,
   forasmuch as this is a point of the greatest importance, without the
   knowledge and belief whereof we cannot have any true and solid ground
   of coming unto God (because if he from eternity intended good only to a
   few, and those few are not set down in the Scriptures, which were
   written that we through the comfort of them might have hope, no man can
   certainly, yea, probably, infer that he is in the number of those few,
   the contrary being ten thousand to one more likely), what other clear
   passages of Scripture have you which show that God, in sending Christ
   and proposing the gospel, aimed not at the salvation of a certain elect
   number, but of men in general?

   A. John iii. 16, 17, vi. 33, iv. 42, 1 John iv. 14; John xii. 46, 47;
   Mark xvi. 15, 16; Col. i. 23, 28; 1 Tim. ii. 1-4; 2 Pet. iii. 9; 2 Cor.
   v. 19, 1 John ii. 1, 2.

   1. That God is good to all men, and bountiful, being a wise, powerful,
   liberal provider for the works of his hands, in and by innumerable
   dispensations and various communications of his goodness to them, and
   may in that regard be said to have a universal love for them all, is
   granted; but that God loveth all and every man alike, with that eternal
   love which is the fountain of his giving Christ for them and to them,
   and all good things with him, is not in the least intimated by any of
   those places of Scripture where they are expressed for whom Christ
   died, as elsewhere hath been abundantly manifested.

   2. It is confessed that "this is a point of the greatest importance"
   (that is, of very great), "without the knowledge and belief whereof we
   cannot have any true and solid ground of coming unto God," -- namely,
   of the love of God in Christ; but that to know the universality of his
   love is of such importance cannot be proved, unless that can be
   numbered which is wanting, and that weighed in the balance which is
   not.

   3. We say not that "God from all eternity intended good only to a few,"
   etc. He intended much good to all and every man in the world, and
   accordingly, in abundance of variety, accomplisheth that his intention
   towards them, -- to some in a greater, to some in a lesser measure,
   according as seems good to his infinite wisdom and pleasure, for which
   all things were created and made, Rev. iv. 11. And for that particular
   eminent good of salvation by Jesus Christ, for the praise of his
   glorious grace, we do not say that he intended that from eternity for a
   few, absolutely considered, for these will appear in the issue to be "a
   great multitude, which no man can number," Rev. vii. 9; but that in
   comparison of them who shall everlastingly come short of his glow, we
   say that they are but a "little flock," yea, "few they are that are
   chosen," as our Saviour expressly affirms, whatever Mr B. be pleased to
   tell us to the contrary.

   4. That the granting that they are but few that are chosen (though many
   be called), and that "before the foundation of the world" some are
   chosen to be holy and unblamable in love through Christ, having their
   "names written in the book of life," is a discouragement to any to come
   to God, Mr B. shall persuade us when he can evince that the secret and
   eternal purpose of God's discriminating between persons as to their
   eternal conditions is the great ground and bottom of our approach unto
   God, and not the truth and faithfulness of the promises which he hath
   given, with his holy and righteous commands, The issue that lies before
   them who are commanded to draw nigh to God is, not whether they are
   elected or no, but whether they will believe or no, God having given
   them eternal and unchangeable rules: "He that believeth shall be saved,
   but he that believeth not shall be damned." Though no man's name be
   written in the Scripture, he that believes hath the faith of God's
   veracity to assure him that he shall be saved. It is a most vain
   surmisal, that as to that obedience which God requires of us, there is
   any obstruction laid by this consideration, that they are but few which
   are chosen.

   5. This is indeed the only true and solid ground of coming unto God by
   Christ, that God hath infallibly conjoined faith and salvation, so that
   whosoever believes shall be saved; neither doth the granting of the
   pretended universality of God's love afford any other ground whatever;
   and this is not in the least shaken or impaired by the effectual love
   and purpose of God for the salvation of some. And if Mr B. hath any
   other true and solid ground of encouraging men to come to God by Christ
   besides and beyond this, which may not, on one account or other, be
   educed from it or resolved into it (I mean of God's command and
   promise), I do here beg of him to acquaint me with it, and I shall give
   him more thanks for it, if I live to see it done, than as yet I can
   persuade myself to do on the account of all his other labours which I
   have seen.

   6. We say, though God hath chosen some only to salvation by Christ, --
   yet the names of those some are not expressed in Scripture, the doing
   whereof would have been destructive to the main end of the word, the
   nature of faith, and all the ordinances of the gospel, -- yet God
   having declared that whosoever believeth shall be saved, there is
   sufficient ground for all and every man in the world to whom the gospel
   is preached to come to God by Christ, and other ground there is none,
   nor can be offered by the assertors of the pretended universality of
   God's love. Nor is this proposition, "He that believeth shall be
   saved," founded on the universality of love pleaded for, but on the
   sufficiency of the means for the accomplishment of what is therein
   asserted, -- namely, the blood of Christ, who is believed on.

   Now, because Mr B. expresseth that the end of his asserting this
   universality of God's love is to decry his eternal purpose of election,
   it being confessed that between these two there is an inconsistency,
   without entering far into that controversy, I shall briefly show what
   the Scripture speaks to the latter, and how remote the places mentioned
   by Mr B. are from giving countenance to the former, in the sense
   wherein by him who asserts it it is understood.

   For the first, methinks a little respect and reverence to that
   testimony of our Saviour, "Many are called, but few are chosen," might
   have detained this gentleman from asserting with so much confidence
   that the persuasion of God's choosing but a few is an obstruction of
   men's coming unto God. Though he looks upon our blessed Saviour as a
   mere man, yet I hope he takes him for a true man, and one that taught
   the way of God aright. But a little farther to clear this matter:--

   1. Some are chosen from eternity, and are under the purpose of God, as
   to the good mentioned. 2. Those some are some only, not all; and
   therefore, as to the good intended, there is not a universal love in
   God as to the objects of it, but such a distinguishing one as is spoken
   against: Eph. i. 4, 5, "According as he hath chosen us in him before
   the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame
   before him in love: having predestinated us to the adoption of children
   by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his
   will." Here are some chosen, and consequently an intention of God
   concerning them expressed, and this from eternity, or before the
   foundation of the world, and this to the good of holiness, adoption,
   salvation; and this is only of some, and not of all the world, as the
   whole tenor of the discourse, being referred to believers, doth
   abundantly manifest. Rom. viii. 28-30, "We know that all things work
   together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called
   according to his purpose. For whom he did foreknow, he also did
   predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be
   the first-born among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate,
   them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and
   whom he justified, them he also glorified." The good here intended is
   glory, that the apostle closes withal, "Whom he justified, them he also
   glorified;" the means to that end consist in vocation and
   justification; the persons to be made partakers of this end are, not
   all the world, but "the called according to his purpose;" the
   designation of them so distinguished to the end expressed is from the
   purpose, foreknowledge, and predestination of God, -- that is, his
   everlasting intention. Were it another man with whom we had to do, I
   should wonder that it came into his mind to deny this eternal intention
   of God towards some for good; but nothing is strange from the gentleman
   of our present contest. They are but some which are "ordained to
   eternal life," Acts xiii. 48; but some that are "given to Christ," John
   xvii. 6; "a remnant according to election," Rom. xi. 5; one being
   chosen when another was rejected "before they were born, or had done
   either good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election
   might stand," chap. ix. 11, 12; and those who obtain salvation are
   "chosen thereunto through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of
   the truth," 2 Thess. ii. 13. All that is intended by them whom Mr B.
   thinketh to load with the opinion he rejects is but what in these and
   many other places of Scripture is abundantly revealed: God from all
   eternity, "according to the purpose of his own will," or "the purpose
   which is according to election," hath chosen some, and appointed them
   to the obtaining of life and salvation by Christ, to the praise of his
   glorious grace. For the number of these, be they few or many, in
   comparison of the rest of the world, the event doth manifest.

   Yet farther to evidence that this purpose of God or intention spoken of
   is peculiar and distinguishing, there is express mention of another
   sort of men who are not thus chosen, but lie under the purpose of God
   as to a contrary lot and condition: "The Lord hath made all things for
   himself; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil," Prov. xvi. 4. They
   are persons "whose names are not written in the book of life of the
   Lamb," Rev. xiii. 8; being "of old ordained to condemnation," Jude 4;
   being as "natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed," 2 Pet.
   ii. 12. And therefore the apostle distinguisheth all men into those who
   are "appointed to wrath," and those who are "appointed to the obtaining
   of salvation by Jesus Christ," 1 Thess. v. 9; an instance of which
   eternally discriminating purpose of God is given in Jacob and Esau,
   Rom. ix. 11, 12: which way and procedure therein of God the apostle
   vindicates from all appearance of unrighteousness, and stops the mouths
   of all repiners against it, from the sovereignty and absolute liberty
   of his will in dealing with all the sons of men as he pleaseth, verses
   14-21; concluding that, in opposition to them whom God hath made
   "vessels of mercy prepared unto glory," there are also "vessels of
   wrath fitted to destruction," verses 22, 23.

   Moreover, in all eminent effects and fruits of love, in all the issues
   and ways of it, for the good of and towards the sons of men, God
   abundantly manifests that his eternal love, that regards the
   everlasting good of men, as it was before described, is peculiar, and
   not universally comprehensive of all and every one of mankind.

   1. In the pursuit of that love he gave his Son to die: "God commendeth
   his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
   us," Rom. v. 8. "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he
   loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins," 1 John
   iv. 10. Now, though he died not for the Jews only, but for all, for the
   whole world, or men throughout the whole world, yet that he died for
   some only of all sorts throughout the world, even those who are so
   chosen, as is before mentioned, and not for them who are rejected, as
   was above declared, himself testifies: John xvii. 9, "I pray for them;
   I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me;"
   "Thine they were, and thou gavest them me," verse 6; "And for their
   sakes I sanctify myself," verse 19: even as he had said before, that he
   came to "give his life a ransom for many," Matt. xx. 28; which Paul
   afterward abundantly confirms, affirming that "God redeemed his church
   with his own blood," Acts xx. 28. Not the world, as contradistinguished
   from his church, nor absolutely, but his church throughout the world.
   And to give us a clearer insight into his intendment in naming the
   church in this business, he tells us they are God's elect whom he
   means: Rom. viii. 32-34, "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered
   him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all
   things? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God
   that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea
   rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
   also maketh intercession for us." They are the elect for whom God gave
   his Son, and that out of his love (which the apostle eminently sets
   out, verse 32), those to whom with his Son he gives all things, and who
   shall on that account never be separated from him.

   Farther, to manifest that this great fruit and effect of the love of
   God, which is extended to the whole object of that love, was not
   universal:-- (1.) The promise of giving him was not so; God promised
   Christ to all for and to whom he giveth him: "The Lord God of Israel by
   him visited and redeemed his people, raising up an horn of salvation
   for them in the house of his servant David; as he spake by the mouth of
   his holy prophets, which have been since the world began," Luke i.
   68-70. In the very first promise of him, the seed of the serpent (as
   are all reprobate unbelievers) are excluded from any interest therein,
   Gen. iii. 15. And it was renewed again, not to all the world, but to
   "Abraham and his seed," Gen. xii. 2, 3; Acts ii. 39, iii. 25 And for
   many ages the promise was so appropriated to the seed of Abraham, Rom.
   ix. 4, with some few that joined themselves to them, Isa. lvi. 3-7,
   that the people of God prayed for a curse on the residue of the world,
   Jer. x. 25, as they which were "strangers from the covenants of
   promise," Eph. ii. 12; they belonged not to them. So that God made not
   a promise of Christ to the universality of mankind; which sufficiently
   evinceth that it was not from a universal but a peculiar love that he
   was given. Nor, --

   (2.) When Christ was exhibited in the flesh, according to the promise,
   was he given to all, but to the church, Isa. ix. 6; neither really as
   to their good, nor ministerially for the promulgation of the gospel to
   any, but to the Jews. And therefore when "he came unto his own," though
   "his own received him not," John i. 11, yet as to the ministry which he
   was to accomplish, he professed he was "not sent but to the lost sheep
   of the house of Israel," and gave order to them whom he sent forth to
   preach in his own lifetime "not to go into the way of the Gentiles, nor
   to enter into any city of the Samaritans," Matt. x. 5. Yea, when he had
   been "lifted up' to "draw all men unto him," John iii. 14, xii. 32,
   and, being ascended, had broken down the partition wall and taken away
   all distinction of Jew and Gentile, circumcision and uncircumcision,
   having died not only for that nation of the Jews (for "the remnant
   according to the election of grace," Rom. xi. 5), but that he "might
   gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad,"
   John xi. 52, -- whence the language and expressions of the Scripture as
   to the people of God are changed, and instead of "Judah and Israel,"
   they are expressed by "the world," John iii. 16, "the whole world," 1
   John v. 1, 2, and "all men," 1 Tim. ii. 4, in opposition to the Jews
   only, some of all sorts being now taken into grace and favour with God,
   -- yet neither then doth he do what did remain for the full
   administration of the covenant of grace towards all, namely, the
   pouring out of his Spirit with efficacy of power to bring them into
   subjection to him, but still carries on, though in a greater extent and
   latitude, a work of distinguishing love, taking some and refusing
   others. So that, being "exalted, and made a prince and a saviour," he
   gives not repentance to all the world, but to them whom he "redeemed
   to. God by his blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and
   nation," Rev. v. 9.

   It appears, then, from the consideration of this first most eminent
   effect of the love of God, in all the concernments of it, that that
   love which is the foundation of all the grace and glory, of all the
   spiritual and eternal good things, whereof the sons of men are made
   partakers, is not universal, but peculiar and distinguishing.

   Mr B. being to prove his former assertion, of the universality of God's
   love, mentions sundry places where God is said to love the world, and
   to send his Son to be the Saviour of the world, John iii. 16, 17, vi.
   33, iv. 42, 1 John iv. 14; John xii. 46, 47, 1 John ii. 1, 2: the
   reason of which expressions the reader was before acquainted with. The
   benefits of the death of Christ being now no more to be confined to one
   nation, but promiscuously to be imparted to the children of God that
   were scattered abroad throughout the world in every kindred, tongue,
   and nation under heaven, the word "world" being used to signify men
   living in the world, sometimes more, sometimes fewer, seldom or never
   "all" (unless a distribution of them into several sorts, comprehensive
   of the universality of mankind, be subjoined), that word is used to
   express them who, in the intention of God and Christ, are to be made
   partakers of the benefits of his mediation, men of all sorts throughout
   the world being now admitted thereunto, as was before asserted.

   2. The benefit of redemption being thus grounded upon the principle of
   peculiar, not universal love, whom doth God reveal his will concerning
   it unto? and whom doth he call to the participation thereof? If it be
   equally provided for all out of the same love, it is all the reason in
   the world that all should equally be called to a participation thereof,
   or, at least, so be called as to have it made known unto them. For a
   physician to pretend that he hath provided a sovereign remedy for all
   the sick persons in a city, out of an equal love that he bears to them
   all, and when he hath done takes care that only some few know of it,
   whereby they may come and be healed, but leaves the rest in utter
   ignorance of any such provision that he hath made, will he be thought
   to deal sincerely in the profession that he makes of doing this out of
   an equal love to them all? Now, not only for the space of almost four
   thousand years did God suffer incomparably the greatest part of the
   whole world to walk in their own ways, not calling them to repent, Acts
   xiv. 16, winking at that long time of their ignorance, wherein they
   worshipped stocks, stones, and devils, all that while "showing his word
   unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel, not dealing so
   with any nation, whereby they knew not his judgments," Ps. cxlvii. 19,
   20, -- so, in the pursuit of his eternal love, calling a few only in
   comparison, leaving the bulk of mankind in sin, "ha ving no hope, and
   without God in the world," Eph. ii. 12; but even also since the giving
   out of a commission and express command not to confine the preaching of
   the word and calling of men to Judea, but to "go into all the world and
   to preach the gospel to every creature," Mark xvi. 15, -- whereupon it
   is shortly after said to be "preached to every creature under heaven,"
   Col. i. 23, the apostle thereby "warning every man, and teaching every
   man, that he might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus," verse
   28, namely, of all those to whom he came and preached, not of the Jews
   only, but of all sorts of men under heaven, and that on this ground,
   that "God would have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge
   of the truth," 1 Tim. ii. 3, 4, be they of what sort they will, kings,
   rulers, and all under authority, -- to this very day, many whole
   nations, great and numerous, sit in darkness and in the shadow of
   death, having neither in their own days nor in the days of their
   forefathers ever been made partakers of the glorious gospel of Jesus
   Christ, whereby alone life and immortality are brought to light, and
   men are made partakers of the love of God in them. So that yet we have
   not the least evidence of the universal love pleaded for. Yea:--

   3. Whereas, to the effectual bringing of men "dead in trespasses and
   sins" to a participation of any saving, spiritual effect of the love of
   God in Christ, besides the promulgation of the gospel and the law
   thereof, -- which consisteth in the infallible connection of faith and
   salvation, according to the tenor of it, Mark xvi. 16, "He that
   believeth shall be saved," which is accompanied with God's command to
   believe, wherein he declares his will for their salvation upon the
   terms proposed, approving the obedience of faith, and giving assurance
   of salvation thereupon, 1 Tim. ii. 1-4, -- there is moreover required
   the operation of God by his Spirit with power, to evince that all this
   dispensation is managed by peculiar, distinguishing love, this is not
   granted to all to whom the commanding and approving word doth come, but
   only "to them who are the called according to his purpose," Rom. viii.
   28; that is, to them who are "predestinated," verse 30, for them he
   calls, so as to justify and glorify them thereupon.

   4. Not, then, to insist on any other particular effects of the love of
   God, as sanctification, justification, glorification, this in general
   may be affirmed, that there is not any one good thing whatsoever that
   is proper and peculiar to the covenant of grace, but it proceeds from a
   distinguishing love and an intention of God towards some only therein.

   5. It is true that God inviteth many to repentance, and earnestly
   inviteth them, by the means of the word which he affords them, to turn
   from their evil ways, of whom all the individuals are not converted, as
   he dealt with the house of Israel (not all the world, but) those who
   had his word and ordinances, Ezek. xviii. 31, 32, affirming that it is
   not for his pleasure but for their sins that they die; but that this
   manifests a universal love in God in the way spoken of, or any thing
   more than the connection of repentance and acceptation with God, with
   his legal approbation of turning from sin, there is no matter of proof
   to evince.

   6. Also, "he is not willing that any should perish, but that all should
   come to repentance," 2 Pet. iii. 9, even all those towards whom he
   exercises patience and long-suffering for that end; which, as the
   apostle there informs us, is "to us-ward," -- that is, to believers, of
   whom he is speaking. Of them, also, it is said that "he doth not
   afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men," Lam. iii. 33, even
   his church, of which the prophet is speaking; although this also may be
   extended to all, God never afflicting or grieving men but it is for
   some other reason and cause than merely his own will, their destruction
   being of themselves. David, indeed, tells us that "the Lord is
   gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy;"
   that "the Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his
   works," Ps. cxlv. 8, 9: but he tells us withal whom he intends by the
   "all" in this place, even the "generations which praise his works and
   declare his mighty acts," verse 4; those who "abundantly utter the
   memory of his great goodness, and sing of his righteousness," verse 7;
   or his "saints," as he expressly calls them, verse 10. The work he
   there mentions is the work of the kingdom of Christ over all, wherein
   the tender mercies of God are spread abroad in reference to them that
   do enjoy them. Not but that God is good to all, even to his whole
   creation, in the many unspeakable blessings of his providence, wherein
   he abounds towards them in all goodness, but that is not here intended.
   So that Mr B. hath fruitlessly from these texts of Scripture
   endeavoured to prove a universality of love in God, inconsistent with
   his peculiar love, purpose, and intention of doing good, in the sense
   declared, to some only.

   And thus have I briefly gone through this chapter, and by the way taken
   into consideration all the texts of Scripture which he there wrests to
   confirm his figment, On the goodness of the nature of God; of the
   goodness and love to all which he shows, in great variety and several
   degrees, in the dispensation of his providence throughout the world; of
   this universal love, and what it is in the sense of Mr B. and his
   companions; of its inconsistency with the immutability, prescience,
   omnipotence, fidelity, love, mercy, and faithfulness of God, -- this
   being not a controversy peculiar to them with whom in this treatise I
   have to do, I shall not farther insist.

   As I have in the preface to this discourse given an account of the rise
   and present state of Socinianism, so I thought in this place to have
   given the reader an account of the present state of the controversy
   about grace and free-will, and the death of Christ, with especial
   reference to the late management thereof amongst the Romanists, between
   the Molinists and Jesuits on the one side, and the Jansenians or Bayans
   on the other, with the late ecclesiastical and political transactions
   in Italy, France, and Flanders, in reference thereunto, with an account
   of the books lately written on the one side and the other, and my
   thoughts of them; but finding this treatise grown utterly beyond my
   intention, I shall defer the execution of that design to some other
   opportunity, if God think good to continue my portion any longer in the
   land of the living.

   The fourteenth chapter of the catechist is about the resurrection of
   Christ. What are the proper fruits of the resurrection of Christ, and
   the benefits we receive thereby, and upon what account our
   justification is ascribed thereto, -- whether as the great and eminent
   confirmation of the doctrine he taught, or as the issue, pledge, and
   evidence of the accomplishment of the work of our salvation by his
   death, it being impossible for him to be detained thereby, -- is not
   here discussed. That which appears to be the great design of this
   chapter, is to disprove Christ's raising himself by his own power;
   concerning which this is the question:--

   Q. Did Christ rise by his own power, yea, did he raise himself at all
   It or was he raised by the power of another, and did another raise him?
   What is the perpetual tenor of the Scripture to this purpose?

   In answer hereunto, many texts of Scripture are rehearsed, where it is
   said that God raised him from the dead, and that he was raised by the
   power of God.

   But we gave manifested that Mr B. is to come to another reckoning
   before he can make any work of this argument, "God raised him,
   therefore he did not raise himself." When he hath proved that he is not
   God, let him freely make such an inference and conclusion as this. In
   the meantime, we say, because God raised him from the dead, he raised
   himself; for he is "over all, God blessed for ever."

   It is true that Christ is said to be raised by God, taken personally
   for the Father, whose joint power, with his own, and that also of the
   Spirit, was put forth in this work of raising Christ from the dead. And
   for his own raising himself, if Mr B. will believe him, this business
   will be put to a short issue. He tells us that "he laid down his life,
   that he might take it again." "No man," saith he, "taketh it from me. I
   have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again," John x.
   17, 18. And speaking of the temple of his body, he bade the Jews
   destroy it, and said that he would raise it again in three days; which
   we believe he did, and if Mr B. be otherwise minded, we cannot help it.

Chapter XXXII.

   Of justification and faith.

   This chapter, for the title and subject of it, would require a large
   and serious consideration; but by Mr Biddle's loose procedure in this
   business (whom only I shall now attend), we are absolved from any
   strict inquiry into the whole doctrine that is concerned herein. Some
   brief animadversions upon his questions and suiting of answers to them
   will be' all that I shall go forth unto. His first is:--

   Ques. How many sorts of justification or righteousness are there?

   This question supposeth righteousness and justification to be the same,
   which is a gross notion for a Master of Arts. Righteousness is that
   which God requires of us; justification is his act concerning man
   considered as vested or endued with that righteousness which he
   requires. Righteousness is the qualification of the person to be
   justified; justification, the act of him that justifies. A man's legal
   honesty in his trial is not the sentence of the judge pronouncing him
   so to be, to all ends and purposes of that honesty. But to his question
   Mr B. answers from Rom. x. 5, "The righteousness which is of the law;"
   and Phil. iii. 9, "The righteousness which is of God by faith."

   It is true, there is this twofold righteousness that men may be
   partakers of, -- a righteousness consisting in exact, perfect, and
   complete obedience yielded to the law, which God required of man under
   the covenant of works; and the righteousness which is of God by faith,
   of which afterward. Answerable hereunto there is, hath been, or may be,
   a twofold justification; -- the one consisting in God's declaration of
   him who performs all that he requires in the law to be just and
   righteous, and his acceptation of him according to the promise of life
   which he annexed to the obedience which of man he did require; and the
   other answers that righteousness which shall afterward be described.
   Now, though these two righteousnesses agree in their general end, which
   is acceptation with God, and a reward from him according to his
   promise, yet in their own natures, causes, and manner of attaining,
   they are altogether inconsistent and destructive of each other, so that
   it is utterly impossible they should ever meet in and upon the same
   person.

   For the description of the first, Mr B. gives it in answer to this
   question:--

   Q. How is the righteousness which is of the law described?

   A. Rom. x. 5, "Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
   that the man which doeth those things shall live by them."

   This description is full and complete. "The doing of the things of the
   law," or all the things the law requireth, to this end, that a man may
   "live by them," or a "keeping of the commandments" that we may "enter
   into life," makes up this righteousness of the law; and whatsoever any
   man doth or may do that is required by the law of God (as believing,
   trusting in him, and the like), to this end, that he may live thereby,
   that it may be his righteousness towards God, that thereupon he may be
   justified, it belongs to this righteousness of the law here described
   by Moses. I say, whatever is performed by man in obedience to any law
   of God, to this end, that a man may live thereby, and that it may be
   the matter of his righteousness, it belongs to the righteousness here
   described. And of this we may have some use in the consideration of Mr
   B.'s ensuing queries. He adds:--

   Q. What speaketh the righteousness which is of faith?

   A. Rom. x. 8, 9, "The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy
   heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; that if thou shalt
   confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart
   that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."

   The object of justifying faith, namely, Jesus Christ as dying and
   rising again from the dead, to the obtaining of eternal redemption and
   bringing in everlasting righteousness, is in these words described. And
   this is that which the righteousness of faith is said to speak, because
   Christ dying and rising is our righteousness He is made so to us of
   God, and being under the consideration of his death and resurrection
   received of us by faith, we are justified.

   His next question is:--

   Q. In the justification of a believer, is the righteousness of Christ
   imputed to him, or is his onto faith counted for righteousness?

   A. Rom. iv. 5, "His faith is counted for righteousness."

   What Mr B. intends by faith, and what by accounting of it for
   righteousness, we know full well. The justification he intends by these
   expressions is the plain old pharisaical justification, and no other,
   as shall elsewhere be abundantly manifested. For the present, I shall
   only say that Mr B. doth most ignorantly oppose the imputing of the
   righteousness of Christ to us, and the accounting of our faith for
   righteousness, as inconsistent. It is the accounting of our faith for
   righteousness and the righteousness of works that is opposed by the
   apostle. The righteousness of faith and the righteousness of Christ are
   every way one and the same; -- the one denoting that whereby we receive
   it and are made partakers of it; the other, that which is received and
   whereby we are justified. And, indeed, there is a perfect inconsistency
   between the apostle's intention in this expression, "To him that
   worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his
   faith is counted for righteousness," taken with his explication of it,
   that we are made partakers of the righteousness of Christ by faith, and
   therein he is made righteousness to them that believe, and Mr B.'s
   interpretation of it, which is (as shall be farther manifested), "To
   him that worketh, and believes on him that justifies the righteous, his
   obedience is his righteousness" But of this elsewhere.

   The next question and answer are about Abraham and his justification;
   which being but an instance exemplifying what was spoken before, I
   shall not need to insist thereon. Of his believing on God only, our
   believing on Christ, which is also mentioned, I have spoken already,
   and shall not trouble the reader with repetition thereof.

   But he farther argues:--

   Q. Doth not God justify men because of the full price Christ paid to
   him in their stead, so that he abated nothing of his right, in that one
   drop of Christ's blood was sufficient to satisfy for a thousand worlds?
   If not, how are they saved it?

   A. Rom. iii. 24, "Being justified freely," Eph. i. 7.

   That Christ did pay a full price or ransom for us, that he did stand in
   our stead, that he was not abated any jot of the penalty of the law
   that was due to sinners, that on this account we are fully acquitted,
   and that the forgiveness of our sins is by the redemption that is in
   his blood, have been already fully and at large evinced. Let Mr B., if
   he please, attempt to evert what hath been spoken to that purpose.

   The expression about "one drop of Christ's blood" is a fancy or
   imagination of idle monks, men ignorant of the righteousness of God and
   of the whole nature of the mediation which our blessed Saviour
   undertook, wherein they have not the least communion. The close of the
   chapter is, --

   Q. Did not Christ merit eternal life and purchase the kingdom of
   heaven, for us?

   A. Rom. vi. 23, "The gift of God is eternal life." Luke xii. 32, "It is
   your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."

   Eternal life is the gift of God, in opposition to any merit of ours,
   and in respect of his designation of him who is eternal life to be our
   mediator and purchaser of it; yet that Christ did not therefore obtain
   by his blood for us eternal redemption, Heb. ix. 12, that he did not
   purchase us to himself, Tit. ii. 14, or that the merit of Christ for us
   and the free grace of God unto us are inconsistent, our catechist
   attempts not to prove. Of the reconciliation of God's purpose and good
   pleasure, mentioned Luke xii. 32, with the satisfaction and merit of
   the Mediator, I have spoken also at large already.

   I have thus briefly passed through this chapter, although it treateth
   of one of the most important heads of our religion, because (the Lord
   assisting) I intend the full handling of the doctrine opposed in it in
   a treatise just to that purpose, [vol. v.]
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter XXXIII.

   Of keeping the commandments of God, and of perfection of obedience --
   How attainable in this life.

   The title of the sixteenth chapter in our catechist is, "Of keeping the
   commandments and having an eye to the reward; of perfection in virtue
   and godliness to be attained; and of departing from righteousness and
   faith." What the man hath to offer on these several heads shall be
   considered in order. His first question is, --

   Ques. Are the commandments possible to be kept?

   Ans. 1 John v. 3, "His commandments are not grievous." Matt. xi. 30,
   "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light."

   1. I presume it is evident to every one at the first view that there is
   very little relation between the question and the answer thereunto
   suggested. The inquiry is of our strength and power; the answer speaks
   to the nature of the commands of God. It never came, sure, into the
   mind of any living that the meaning of this question, "Are the
   commandments possible to be kept?" is, "Is there an absolute
   impossibility, from the nature of the commands of God themselves, that
   they can be kept by any?" nor did ever any man say so, or can, without
   the greatest blasphemy against God. But the question is, what power
   there is in man to keep those commandments of God; which certainly the
   texts insisted on by Mr Biddle do not in the least give an answer unto.

   2. He tells us not in what state or condition he supposes that person
   to be concerning whom the inquiry is made whether he can possibly keep
   the commandments of God or no, -- whether he speaks of all men in
   general, or any man indefinitely, or restrainedly of believers. Nor, --

   3. Doth he inform us what he intends by keeping the commands of God;
   whether an exact, perfect, and every way complete keeping of them, up
   to the highest degree of all things, in all things, circumstances, and
   concernments of them, or whether the keeping of them in a universal
   sincerity, accepted before God, according to the tenor of the covenant
   of grace, be intended. Nor, --

   4. What commandments they are which he chiefly respects, and under what
   consideration, -- whether all the commands of the law of God as such,
   or whether the gospel commands of faith and love, which the places from
   whence he answers do respect. Nor, --

   5. What he means by the impossibility of keeping God's commands, which
   he intends to deny, -- that which is absolutely so from the nature of
   the thing itself, or that which is so only in some respect, with
   reference to some certain state and condition of man.

   When we know in what sense the question is proposed, we shall be
   enabled to return an answer thereunto; which he that hath proposed it
   here knew not how to do. In the meantime, to the thing itself intended,
   according to the light of the premised distinctions, we say, 1. That
   all the commandments of God, the whole law, is excellent, precious, not
   grievous in itself or its own nature, but admirably expressing the
   goodness, and kindness, and holiness of him that gave it, in relation
   to them to whom it was given, and can by no means be said, as from
   itself and upon its own account, to be impossible to be kept. Yet., --

   2. No unregenerate man can possibly keep, that is, hath in himself a
   power to keep, any one of all the commandments of God, as to the matter
   required and the manner wherein it is required. This impossibility is
   not in the least relating to the nature of the law, but to the
   impotency and corruption of the person lying under it.

   3. No man, though regenerate, can fulfil the law of God perfectly, or
   keep all the commandments of God, according to the original tenor of
   the law, in all the parts and degrees of it, nor did ever any man do so
   since sin entered into the world; for it is impossible that any
   regenerate man should keep the commandments of God as they are the
   tenor of the covenant of works. If this were otherwise, the law would
   not have been made weak by sin that it should not justify.

   4. That it is impossible that any man, though regenerate, should by his
   own strength fulfil any one of the commands of God, seeing "without
   Christ we can do nothing," and it is "God which worketh in us both to
   will and to do of his good pleasure."

   5. That to keep the commandments of God, not as [to] the tenor of the
   covenant of works, or in an absolute perfection of obedience and
   correspondency to the law, but sincerely and uprightly unto
   acceptation, according to the tenor of the covenant of grace and the
   obedience it requires, through the assistance of the Spirit and grace
   of God, is not only a thing possible, but easy, pleasant, and
   delightful.

   Thus we say, --

   (1.) That a person regenerate, by the assistance of the Spirit and
   grace of God, may keep the commandments of God, in yielding to him, in
   answer to them, that sincere obedience which in Jesus Christ, according
   to the tenor of the covenant of grace, is required; yea, it is to him
   an easy and pleasant thing so to do.

   (2.) That an unregenerate person should keep any one of God's
   commandments as he ought is impossible, not from the nature of God's
   commands, but from his own state and condition.

   (3.) That a person, though regenerate, yet being so but in part, and
   carrying about with him a body of death, should keep the commands of
   God in a perfection of obedience, according to the law of the covenant
   of works, is impossible from the condition of a regenerate man, and not
   from the nature of God's commands.

   What is it, now, that Mr B. opposes? or what is that he asserts?

   I suppose he declares his mind in his Lesser Catechism, chap. vii.
   ques. 1, where he proposes his question in the words of the ruler
   amongst the Jews, "What good shall a man do that he may have eternal
   life?" An answer of it follows in that of our Saviour, Matt. xix.
   17-19, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."

   The intendment of this inquiry must be the same with his that made it,
   as his argument in the whole is, or the answer of our Saviour is no way
   suited thereunto. Now, it is most evident that the inquiry was made
   according to the principles of the Pharisees, who expected
   justification by the works of the law, according to the tenor of a
   covenant of works; to which presumption of theirs our Saviour suits his
   answer, and seeing they sought to be justified and saved, as it were,
   by the works of the law, to the law he sends them. This, then, being Mr
   B.'s sense, wherein he affirms that it is possible to keep the
   commandments so as, for doing good and keeping them, to enter into
   life, I shall only remit him, as our Saviour did the Pharisee, to the
   law; but yet I shall withal pray that our merciful Lord would not leave
   him to the foolish choice of his own darkened heart, but in his due
   time, "by the blood of the covenant," which yet he seems to despise,
   send him forth "out of the pit wherein is no water."

   Q. But though it be possible to keep the commandments, yet is it not
   enough if we desire and endeavour to keep them, although we actually
   keep them not? and doth not God accept the will for the deed?

   A. 1 Cor. vii. 19; Matt. vii. 21, 24, 26; James i. 25; Rom. ii. 10;
   John xiii. 17; Luke xi. 28; 2 Cor. v. 10; Matt. xvi. 27; Rev. xxii. 12;
   Matt. xix. 17-19; in all which places there is mention of doing the
   will of God, of keeping the commandments of God.

   The aim of this question is to take advantage of what hath been
   delivered by some, not as an ordinary rule for all men to walk by, but
   as an extraordinary relief for some in distress. When poor souls are
   bowed down under the sense of their own weakness and insufficiency for
   obedience, and the exceeding unsuitableness of their best performances
   to the spiritual and exact perfection of the law of God (things which
   the proud Pharisees of the world are unacquainted withal), to support
   them under their distress, they have been by some directed to the
   consideration of the sincerity that was in the obedience which they did
   yield, and guided to examine that by their desires and endeavours. Now,
   as this direction is not without a good foundation in the Scripture,
   Nehemiah describing the saints of God by this character, that they
   "desire to fear the name of God," Neh. i. 11, and David everywhere
   professing this as an eminent property of a child of God, so they who
   gave it were very far from understanding such desires as may be
   pretended as a colour for sloth and negligence, to give countenance to
   the souls and consciences of men in a willing neglect of the
   performance of such duties as they are to press after; but such they
   intend as had adjoined to them, and accompanying of them, earnest,
   continual, sincere endeavours (as Mr B. acknowledgeth) to walk before
   God in all well-pleasing, though they could not attain to that
   perfection of obedience that is required. And in this case, though we
   make not application of the particular rule of accepting the will for
   the deed to the general case, yet we fear not to say that this is all
   the perfection which the best of the saints of God in this life attain
   to, and which, according to the tenor of that covenant wherein we now
   walk with God in Jesus Christ, is accepted. This is all the doing or
   keeping of the commandments that is intended in any of the places
   quoted by Mr B., unless that last, wherein our Saviour sends that proud
   Pharisee, according to his own principles, to the righteousness of the
   law which he followed after, but could not attain But of this more
   afterward. He farther argues:--

   Q. Though it be not only possible but also necessary to keep the
   commandments, yet is it lawful so to do that we may have a right to
   eternal life and the heavenly inheritance? May we seek for honour, and
   glory, and immortality, by well-doing? Is it the tenor of the gospel
   that we should live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter?
   And, finally, ought we to suffer for the kingdom of God, and not, as
   some are pleased to mince that matter, from the kingdom of God? Where
   are the testimonies of Scripture to this purpose?

   A. Rev. xxii. 14; Rom. ii. 6-8; Tit. ii. 11-13; 2 Thess. i. 5.

   Ans. 1. In what sense it is possible to keep the commandments, in what
   not, hath been declared. 2. How it is necessary, or in what sense, or
   for what end, Mr B. hath not yet spoken, though he supposeth he hath;
   but we will take it for granted that it is necessary for us so to do,
   in that sense and for that end and purpose for which it is of us
   required. 3. To allow, then, the gentleman the advantage of his
   captious procedure by a multiplication of entangled queries, and to
   take them in that order wherein they lie:--

   To the first, "Whether we may keep the commandments that we may have
   right to eternal life," I say, -- 1. Keeping of the commandments in the
   sense acknowledged may be looked on, in respect of eternal life, either
   as the cause procuring it or as the means conducing to it. 2. A right
   to eternal life may be considered in respect of the rise and
   constitution of it, or of the present evidence and last enjoyment of
   it. There is a twofold right to the kingdom of heaven, -- a right of
   desert, according to the tenor of the covenant of works, and a right of
   promise, according to the tenor of the covenant of grace. I say, then,
   that it is not lawful, -- that is, it is not the way, rule, and tenor
   of the gospel, -- that we should do or keep the commandments, so that
   doing or keeping should be the cause procuring and obtaining an
   original right, as to the rise and constitution of it, or a right of
   desert, to eternal life. This is the perfect tenor of the covenant of
   works and righteousness of the law, "Do this, and live; if a man do the
   work of the law, he shall live thereby;" and, "If thou wilt enter into
   life, keep the commandments;" which, if there be any gospel or new
   covenant confirmed in the blood of Christ, is antiquated as to its
   efficacy, and was [so,] ever since the entrance of sin into the world,
   as being ineffectual for the bringing of any soul unto God, Rom. viii.
   3; Heb. viii. 11, 12. This, if it were needful, I might confirm with
   innumerable texts of Scripture, and the transcription of a good part of
   the epistles of Paul in particular. 3. The inheritance which is
   purchased for us by Christ, and is the gift of God, plainly excludes
   all such confidence in keeping the commandments as is pleaded for. For
   my part, I willingly ascribe to obedience any thing that hath a
   consistency (in reference to eternal life) with the full purchase of
   Christ and the free donation of God; and therefore I say, -- 4. As a
   means appointed of God, as the way wherein we ought to walk, for the
   coming to and obtaining of the inheritance so fully purchased and
   freely given, for the evidencing of the right given us thereto by the
   blood of Christ, and giving actual admission to the enjoyment of the
   purchase, and to testify our free acceptation with God and adoption on
   that account, so we ought to do and keep the commandments, -- that is,
   walk in holiness, without which none shall see God. This is all that is
   intended, Rev. xxii. 14. Christ speaks not there to unbelievers,
   showing what they must do to be justified and saved, but to redeemed,
   justified, and sanctified ones, showing them their way of admission and
   the means of it to the remaining privileges of the purchase made by his
   blood.

   His next question is, "May we seek for honour, and glory, and
   immortality, by well-doing?" which words are taken from Rom. ii. 7.

   I answer, The words there are used in a law sense, and are declarative
   of the righteousness of God in rewarding the keepers of the law of
   nature, or the moral law, according to the law of the covenant of
   works. This is evident from the whole design of the apostle in that
   place, which is to convince all men, Jews and Gentiles, of sin against
   the law, and of the impossibility of the obtaining the glory of God
   thereby. So, in particular, from verse 10, where salvation is annexed
   to works in the very terms wherein the righteousness of the law is
   expressed by Mr B. in the chapter of justification, and in direct
   opposition whereunto the apostle sets up the righteousness of the
   gospel, chap. i. 17, iii. 4. But yet, translate the words into a gospel
   sense; consider "well-doing" as the way appointed for us to walk in for
   the obtaining of the end mentioned, and consider "glory, and honour,
   and immortality," as a reward of our obedience, purchased by Christ and
   freely promised of God on that account, and I say we may, we ought, "by
   patient continuing in well-doing, to seek for glory, and honour, and
   immortality;" that is, it is our duty to abide in the way and use of
   the means prescribed for the obtaining of the inheritance purchased and
   promised. But yet this with the limitations before in part mentioned;
   as, -- 1. That of ourselves we can do no good; 2. That the ability we
   have to do good is purchased for us by Christ; 3. This is not so full
   in this life as that we can perfectly, to all degrees of perfection, do
   good or yield obedience to the law; 4. That which by grace we do yield
   and perform is not the cause procuring or meriting of that inheritance;
   which, 5. As the grace whereby we obey, is fully purchased for us by
   Christ, and freely bestowed upon us by God.

   His next is, "Is it the tenor of the gospel that we should live
   uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter?" Doubtless, neither
   shall I need to give any answer at all to this part of the inquiry but
   what lies in the words of the scripture produced for the proof of our
   catechist's intention, "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath
   appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly
   lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
   world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
   great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ," Tit. ii. 11-13. Christ, the
   great God our Saviour, having promised an inheritance to us with
   himself, at his glorious appearance, raiseth up our hearts with a hope
   and expectation thereof; his grace, or the doctrine of it, teacheth us
   to perform all manner of holiness and righteousness all our days; and
   this is the tenor and law of the gospel, that so we do. But what this
   is to Mr B.'s purpose I know not.

   His last attempt is upon the exposition of some (I know not whom) who
   have minced the doctrine so small, it seems, that he can find no relish
   in it. Saith he, "Finally, ought we to suffer for the kingdom of God,
   or from the kingdom of God?" His answer is, 2 Thess. i. 5, "That ye may
   be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer." I
   confess, "suffering from the kingdom of God" is something an uncouth
   expression, and those who have used it to the offence of this gentleman
   might have more commodiously delivered what they did intend; but "the
   kingdom of God" being sometimes taken for that rule of grace which
   Christ hath in the hearts of believers, and thereupon being said to be
   "within us," and the word "from" denoting the principle of obedience in
   suffering, there is a truth in the expression, and that very consistent
   with "suffering for the kingdom of God," which here is opposed unto it.
   To "suffer from the kingdom of God" is no more than to be enabled to
   suffer from a principle of grace within us, by which Christ bears rule
   in our hearts; and in this sense we say that no man can do or suffer
   any thing, so as it shall be acceptable unto God, but it must be from
   the kingdom of God; for they that are in the flesh cannot please God,
   even their sacrifices are an abomination to him. This is so far from
   hindering us as to suffering for the kingdom of God, that is, to endure
   persecution for the profession of the gospel ("for," in the place of
   the apostle cited, denotes the procuring occasion, not final cause),
   that without it so we cannot do. And so the minced matter hath, I hope,
   a savoury relish recovered unto it again.

   His next questions are, first, --

   Q. Have you any examples of keeping the commandments under the law?
   What saith David of himself?

   A. Ps. xviii. 20-24.

   And secondly, --

   Q. Have you any example under the gospel?

   A. 1 John iii. 22, "Because we keep his commandments."

   All this trouble is Mr B. advantaged to make from the ambiguity of this
   expression of "keeping the commandments" We know full well what David
   saith of his obedience, and what he said of his sins; so that we know
   his keeping of the commandments was in respect of sincerity as to all
   the commandments of God and all the parts of them, but not as to his
   perfection in keeping all or any of them. And he who says, "We keep his
   commandments," says also, "If we say we have no sin, we lie and deceive
   ourselves, and the truth is not in us." He adds:--

   Q. Have you not examples of the choicest saints who obeyed God in hope
   of the reward, both before, under, and after the law?

   A. Heb. xi. 8-10, 24-26, xii. 1, 2; Tit. i. 1, 2.

   To obey in hope of eternal life is either to yield obedience in hope of
   obtaining eternal life as a reward procured by or proportioned to that
   obedience, and so no saint of God since the fall of Adam did yield
   obedience to God, or ought to have so done; or, to obey in hope of
   eternal life is to carry along with us in our obedience a hope of the
   enjoyment of the promised inheritance in due time, and to be encouraged
   and strengthened in obeying thereby. Thus the saints of God walk with
   God in hope and obedience at this day, and they always did so from the
   beginning. They have hope in and with their obedience of that whereunto
   their obedience leads, which was purchased for them by Christ.

   Q. Do not the Scriptures intimate that Christians may attain to
   perfection of virtue and godliness, and that it is the intention of God
   and Christ and his ministers to bring them to this pitch? Rehearse the
   texts to this effect.

   A. Eph. i. 4, etc.

   Not to make long work of that which is capable of a speedy despatch: By
   "virtue and godliness," Mr B. understands that universal righteousness
   and holiness which the law requires; by "perfection" in it, an
   absolute, complete answerableness to the law in that righteousness and
   holiness, both as to the matter wherein they consist and the manner how
   they are to be performed; "that Christians may attain" expresses a
   power that is reducible into act. So that the "intention" of God and
   the ministers is not that they should be pressing on towards
   perfection, which it is confessed we are to do whilst we live in this
   world, but actually in this life to bring them to an enjoyment of it.
   In this sense we deny that any man in this life "may attain to
   perfection of virtue and godliness;" for, --

   1. All our works are done out of faith, 1 Tim. i. 5, Gal. v. 6. Now,
   this faith is the faith of the forgiveness of sins by Christ, and that
   purifieth the heart, Acts xv. 8, 9; but the works that proceed from
   faith for the forgiveness of sins by Christ cannot be perfect
   absolutely in themselves, because in the very rise of them they expect
   perfection and completeness from another.

   2. Such as is the cause, such is the effect; but the principle or cause
   of the saints' obedience in this life is imperfect: so therefore is
   their obedience. That our sanctification is imperfect in this life, the
   apostle witnesseth, 2 Cor. iv. 16; 1 Cor. xiii. 9.

   3. Where there is flesh and Spirit there is not perfection, for the
   flesh is contrary to the Spirit, from whence our perfection must
   proceed, if we have any; but there is flesh and Spirit in all believers
   whilst they live in this world, Gal. v. 17; Rom. vii. 15.

   4. They that are not without sin are not absolutely perfect, for to be
   perfect is to have no sin; but the saints in this life are not without
   sin, John i. 8, Matt. vi. 12, James iii. 2, Eccles. vii. 20, Isa. lxiv.
   6. But to what end should I multiply arguments and testimonies to this
   purpose? If all the saints of God have acknowledged themselves sinners
   all their days, always deprecated the justice of God, and appealed to
   mercy in their trial before God, -- if all our perfection be by the
   blood of Christ, and we are justified not by the works of the law but
   by grace, -- this pharisaical figment may be rejected as the foolish
   imagination of men ignorant of the righteousness of God, and of him who
   is the end of the law for righteousness to them that do believe.

   But take "perfection" as it is often used in the Scripture, and
   ascribed to men of whom yet many great and eminent failings axe
   recorded (which, certainly, were inconsistent with perfection
   absolutely considered), and so it denotes two things, -- 1. Sincerity,
   in opposition to hypocrisy; and, 2. Universality as to all the parts of
   obedience, in opposition to partiality and halving with God. So we say
   perfection is not only attainable by the saints of God, but is in every
   one of them. But this is not such a perfection as consists in a point,
   which if it deflects from it ceases to be perfection, but such a
   condition as admits of several degrees, all lying in a tendency to that
   perfection spoken of; and the men of this perfection are said to be
   "perfect" or "upright" in the Scripture, Ps. xxxvii. 14, cxix. 1, etc.

   Not, then, to insist on all the places mentioned by Mr B. in
   particular, they may all be referred to four heads:-- 1. Such as
   mention an unblamableness before God in Christ, which argues a
   perfection in Christ, but only a sincerity in us; or, 2. Such as
   mention a perfection in "fieri," but not in "facto esse," as we speak,
   -- a pressing towards perfection, but not a perfection obtained, or
   here obtainable; or, 3. A comparative perfection in respect of others;
   or, 4. A perfection of sincerity accompanied with universality of
   obedience, consistent with indwelling sin and many transgressions. The
   application of the several places mentioned to these rules is easy, and
   lies at hand for any that will take the pains to consider them. He
   proceeds:--

   Q. If works be so necessary to salvation, as you have before showed
   from the Scripture, how cometh it to pass that Paul saith, "We are
   justified by faith without works?" Meant he to exclude all good works
   whatsoever, or only those of the law? How doth he explain himself?

   A. Rom. iii. 28, "We are justified by faith, without the deeds of the
   law."

   Ans. 1. How and in what sense works are necessary to salvation hath
   been declared, and therefore I remit the reader to its proper place.

   2. A full handling of the doctrine of justification was waived before,
   and therefore I shall not here take it up, but content myself with a
   brief removal of Mr B.'s attempts to deface it. I say, then, --

   3. That Paul is very troublesome to all the Pharisees of this age; who
   therefore turn themselves a thousand ways to escape the authority of
   the word and truth of God, by him fully declared and vindicated against
   their forefathers, labouring to fortify themselves with distinctions,
   which, as they suppose, but falsely, their predecessors were ignorant
   of. Paul then, this Paul, denies all works, all works whatsoever, to
   have any share in our justification before God, as the matter of our
   righteousness or the cause of our justification; for, --

   (1.) He excludes all works of the law, as is confessed. The works of
   the law are the works that the law requires. Now, there is no work
   whatever that is good or acceptable to God but it is required by the
   law; so that in excluding works of the law, he excludes all works
   whatever.

   (2.) He expressly excludes all works done by virtue of grace and after
   calling, which, if any, should be exempted from being works of the law;
   for though the law requires them, yet they are not done from a
   principle, nor to an end of the law. These Paul excludes expressly,
   Eph. ii. 8-10, "By grace are ye saved; ... not of works." What works?
   Those which "we are created unto in Christ Jesus."

   (3.) All works that are works are excluded expressly, and set in
   opposition to grace in this business: Rom. xi. 6, "If it be by grace,
   then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace: but if
   it be of works, then is it no more grace; otherwise work is no more
   work;" and chap. iv. 3-5.

   (4.) All works are excluded that take off from the absolute freedom of
   the justification of sinners by the redemption that is in Christ, Rom.
   iii. 20-28. Now, this is not peculiar to any one sort of works, or to
   any one work more than to another, as might be demonstrated; but this
   is not a place for so great a work as the thorough handling of this
   doctrine requires. He adds:--

   Q. Can you make it appear from elsewhere that Paul intended to exclude
   from justification only the perfect works of the law, which leave no
   place for either grace or faith, and not such works as include both;
   and that by a justifying faith he meant a working faith, and such a one
   as is accompanied with righteousness?

   A. Eph. ii. 8-10; Rom. iv. 3-5, xi. 5, 6, iv. 14, 16; Gal. v. 6; Rom.
   i. 17, 18.

   Ans. 1. Still Paul and his doctrine trouble the man, as they did his
   predecessors. That Paul excluded all works, of what sort soever, from
   our justification, as precedaneous causes or conditions thereof, was
   before declared. Mr B. would only have it that the perfect works of the
   law only are excluded, when, if any works take place in our
   justification with God, those only may be admitted; for certainly if we
   are justified or pronounced righteous for our works, it must be for the
   works that are perfect, or else the judgment of God is not according to
   truth. Those only, it seems, are excluded that only may be accepted,
   and imperfect works are substituted as the matter of a perfect
   righteousness, without which none shall stand in the presence of God.
   But, --

   2. There is not one text of Scripture mentioned by Mr B. whence he aims
   to evince his intention but expressly denies what he asserts, and sets
   all works whatever in opposition to grace, and excludes them all from
   any place in our justification before God! so that the man seems to
   have been infatuated by his pharisaism to give direction for his own
   condemnation. Let the places be considered by the reader.

   3. The grace mentioned as the cause of our justification is not the
   grace of God bringing forth good works in us, -- which stand thereupon
   in opposition to the works of the law, as done in the strength of the
   law, -- but the free favour and grace of God towards us in Christ
   Jesus, which excludes all works of ours whatever, as is undeniably
   manifest, Rom. iv. 4, xi. 5, 6.

   4. It is true, justifying faith is a living faith, purging the heart,
   working by love, and bringing forth fruits of obedience; but that its
   fruits of love and good works have any causal influence into our
   justification is most false. We are justified freely by grace, in
   opposition to all fruits of faith whatever which God hath ordained us
   to bring forth. That faith whereby we are justified will never be
   without works; yet we are not justified by the works of it, but freely,
   by the blood of Christ. How and in what sense we are justified by faith
   itself, what part, office, and place, it hath in our justification, its
   consistency in its due place and office with Christ's being our
   righteousness, and its receiving of remission of sins, which is said to
   be our blessedness, shall elsewhere, God assisting, be manifested.

   What, then, hath Mr B. yet remaining to plead in this business The old
   abused refuge of opposing James to Paul is fixed on. This is the beaten
   plea of Papists, Socinians, and Arminians. Saith he:--

   Q. What answer, then, would you give to a man who, wresting the words
   of Paul in certain places of his Epistles to the Romans and Galatians,
   should bear you in hand that all good works whatever are excluded from
   justification and salvation, and that it is enough only to believe?

   A. James ii. 20-26.

   Ans. 1. He that shall exclude good works from salvation, so as not to
   be the way and means appointed of God wherein we ought to walk who seek
   and expect salvation from God, and affirm that it is enough to believe,
   though a man bring forth no fruits of faith or good works, if he
   pretend to be of that persuasion on the account of any thing delivered
   by Paul in the Epistles to the Romans or Galatians, doth wrest the
   words and sense of Paul, and is well confuted by that passage mentioned
   out of James.

   But he that, excluding all works from justification in the sense
   declared, and affirming that it is by faith only without works, affirms
   that the truth and sincerity of that faith, with its efficacy in its
   own kind for our justification, is evinced by works, and the man's
   acceptation with God thereon justified by them, doth not wrest the
   words nor sense of Paul, and speaks to the intendment of James.

   2. Paul instructs us at large how sinners come to be justified before
   God; and this is his professed design in his Epistles to the Romans and
   Galatians. James, professedly exhorting believers to good works,
   demands of them how they will acquit themselves before God and man to
   be justified, and affirms that this cannot be done but by works. Paul
   tells us what justification is; James describes justifying faith by its
   effects. But of this also elsewhere. To all this he subjoins:--

   Q. I would know of you who is a just or righteous man? Is it not such a
   one as apprehendeth and applieth Christ's righteousness to himself, or
   at most desires to do righteously? Is not he accepted of God?

   A. 1 John iii. 7-10, ii. 29; Acts x. 34, 35; Ezek. xviii. 5-9.

   Ans. 1. He to whom "God imputeth righteousness" is righteous. This he
   doth "to him who worketh not, but believeth on him who justifieth the
   ungodly," Rom. iv. 5-7. There is, then, a righteousness without the
   works of the law, Phil. iii. 9. To "apprehend and apply Christ's
   righteousness to ourselves" are expressions of believing unto
   justification which the Scripture will warrant, John i. 12; 1 Cor. i.
   30. He that believeth so as to have Christ made righteousness to him,
   to have righteousness imputed to him, to be freely justified by the
   redemption that is in the blood of Jesus, he is just. And this state
   and condition, as was said, is obtained by applying the righteousness
   of Christ to ourselves, -- that is, by receiving him and his
   righteousness by faith, as tendered unto us in the offer and promises
   of the gospel.

   Of "desiring to do righteously," and what is intended by that
   expression, I have spoken before. But, --

   2. There is a twofold righteousness, -- a righteousness imputed,
   whereby we are justified, and a righteousness inherent, whereby we are
   sanctified. These Mr B. would oppose, and from the assertion of the one
   argue to the destruction of the other, though they sweetly and
   eminently comply in our communion with God. The other righteousness was
   before evinced. Even our sanctification also is called our
   righteousness, and we are said to be just in that respect:--

   (1.) Because our faith and interest in Christ are justified thereby to
   be true, and such as will abide the fiery trial.

   (2.) Because all the acts of it are fruits of righteousness, Rom. vi.
   19-22.

   (3.) Because it stands in opposition to all unrighteousness, and he
   that doth not bring forth the fruit of it is unrighteous.

   (4.) With men, and before them, it is all our righteousness. And of
   this do the places mentioned by Mr B. treat, without the least
   contradiction or colour of it to the imputed righteousness of Christ,
   wherewith we are righteous before God.

   The intendment of the last query in this chapter is to prove the
   apostasy of saints, or that true believers may fall away totally and
   finally from grace. I suppose it will not be expected of me that I
   should enter here into a particular consideration of the places by him
   produced, having lately at large gone through the consideration of the
   whole doctrine opposed, [519] wherein not only the texts here quoted by
   Mr B., but many others, set off by the management of an able head and
   dexterous hand, are at large considered; thither therefore I refer the
   reader.

   It might perhaps have been expected, that having insisted so largely as
   I have done upon some other heads of the doctrine of the gospel
   corrupted by Mr B. and his companions, I should not thus briefly have
   passed over this important article of faith, concerning justification;
   but besides my weariness of the work before me, I have for a
   defensative farther to plead, 1. That this doctrine is of late become
   the subject of very many polemical discourses, to what advantage of
   truth time will show, and I am not willing to add oil to that fire. 2.
   That if the Lord will, and I live, I intend to do something purposely
   for the vindication and clearing of the whole doctrine itself, and
   therefore am not willing occasionally to anticipate here what must in
   another order and method be insisted on; to which, for a close, I add a
   desire, that if any be willing to contend with me about this matter, he
   would forbear exceptions against these extemporary animadversions until
   the whole of my thoughts lie before him, unless he be of the persons
   principally concerned in this whole discourse, of whom I have no reason
   to desire that respect or candor.

Chapter XXXIV.

   Of prayer; and whether Christ prescribed a form of prayer to be used by
   believers; and of praying unto him and in his name under the old
   testament.

   The first question is:--

   Ques. Is prayer a Christian duty?

   Ans. 1 Thess. v. 17, "Pray without ceasing."

   If by "a Christian duty" a duty whereunto all Christians are obliged is
   understood, we grant it a Christian duty. The commands for it,
   encouragements to it, promises concerning it, are innumerable; and the
   use and benefit of it in our communion with God, considering the state
   and condition of sin, emptiness, want, temptation, [and] trials, that
   here we live in, inestimable. If by "a Christian duty" it be intended
   that it is required only of them who are Christians, and is instituted
   by something peculiar in Christian religion, it is denied. Prayer is a
   natural acknowledgment of God that every man is everlastingly and
   indispensably obliged unto by virtue of the law of his creation, though
   the matter of it be varied according to the several states and
   conditions whereinto we fall or are brought. Every one that lives in
   dependency on God and hath his supplies from him is, by virtue of that
   dependence, obliged to this duty, as much as he is to own God to be his
   God. He proceeds:--

   Q. How ought men to pray?

   A. "Lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting," 1 Tim. ii. 8.

   The inquiry being made of the manner of acceptable prayer, the answer
   given, respecting only one or two particulars, is narrow and scanty.
   The qualification of the person praying, the means of access to God,
   the cause of acceptation with him, the ground of our confidence in our
   supplications, the efficacy of the Spirit of grace as promised, are
   either all omitted or only tacitly intimated. But this and many of the
   following questions, with the answers, being in their connection
   capable of a good and fair interpretation, though all be not expressed
   that the Scripture gives in answer to such questions, and the most
   material requisite of prayer, "in the Holy Ghost," be omitted, yet,
   drawing to a close, I shall not farther insist upon them, having yet
   that remaining which requires a more full animadversion.

   Q. Did not Christ prescribe a form of prayer to his disciples, so that
   there remaineth no doubt touching the lawfulness of using a form?

   A. Luke xi. 1-4.

   Ans. If Christ prescribed a form of prayer to his disciples, to be used
   as a form, by the repetition of the same words, I confess it will be
   out of question that it is lawful to use a form; but that it is lawful
   not to use a form, or that a man may use any prayer but a form, on that
   supposition will not be so easily determined. The words of Christ are,
   "When ye pray, say, Our Father," etc. If in this prescription, not the
   matter only but the words also are intended, and that form of them
   which follows is prescribed to be used by virtue of this command of
   Christ, it will be hard to discover on what ground we may any otherwise
   pray, seeing our Saviour's command is positive, "When ye pray, say, Our
   Father," etc.

   That which Mr B. is to prove is, that our Saviour hath prescribed the
   repetition of the same words ensuing; and when he hath done so, if so
   he can do, his conclusion must be that that form ought to be used, not
   at all that any else may. If our Saviour have prescribed us a form, how
   shall any man dare to prescribe another? or can any man do it without
   casting on his form the reproach of imperfection and insufficiency?
   "Our Saviour hath prescribed us a form of prayer, to be used as a form,
   by the repetition of the same words, therefore we may use it, yea, we
   must," is an invincible argument, on supposition of the truth of the
   proposition. But, "Our Saviour hath prescribed us such a form, etc.,
   therefore we may use another which he hath not prescribed," hath
   neither show nor colour of reason in it.

   But how will Mr B. prove that Christ doth not only here instruct his
   disciples in what they ought to pray, and for what they ought in prayer
   to address themselves to God, and under what considerations they are to
   look on God in their approaches to him, and the like, but also that he
   prescribes the words there mentioned by him to be repeated by them in
   their supplications? Luke xi. 2, he bids them say, "Our Father," etc.;
   which at large, Matt. vi. 9, is, Pray after this manner, -- houtos, to
   this purpose. I do not think the prophet prescribes a form of words to
   be used by the church when he says, "Take with you words, and turn to
   the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity," Hos. xiv. 2; but
   rather calls them to fervent supplication for the pardon of sin, as God
   should enable them to deal with him. And though the apostles never
   prayed for any thing but what they were for the substance directed to
   by this prayer of our Saviour, yet we do not find that ever they
   repeated the very words here mentioned, or once commanded or prescribed
   the use of them to any of the saints in their days, whom they exhorted
   to pray so fervently and earnestly: nor in any of the rules and
   directions that are given for our praying, either in reference to
   ourselves or him by whom we have access to God, is the use of these
   words at any time in the least recommended to us, or recalled to mind
   as a matter of duty.

   Our Saviour says, "When ye pray, say, Our Father," etc. On supposition
   of the sense contended for, and that a form of words is prescribed, I
   ask whether we may at any time pray and not say so, seeing he says,
   "When ye pray, say," -- whether we may say any thing else, or use any
   other words? whether the saying of these words be a part of the worship
   of God, or whether any promise of acceptation be annexed to the saying
   soy whether the Spirit of grace and supplications be not promised to
   all believers, and whether he be not given them to enable them to pray,
   both as to matter and manner? and if so, whether the repetition of the
   words mentioned by them who have not the Spirit given them for the ends
   before mentioned be available? and whether prayer by the Spirit, where
   these words are not repeated, as to the letters and syllables and order
   wherein they stand, be acceptable to God? whether the prescription of a
   form of words and the gift of a spirit of prayer be consistent? whether
   the form be prescribed because believers are not able to pray without
   it, or because there is a peculiar holiness, force, and energy in the
   letters, words, and syllables, as they stand in that form and whether
   to say the first of these be not derogatory to the glory of God and
   efficacy of the Spirit promised and given to believers; and the second
   to assert the using of a charm in the worship of God? whether, in that
   respect, "Pater noster" be not as good as "Our Father?" whether
   innumerable poor souls are not deluded and hardened by satisfying their
   consciences in and with the use of this form, never knowing what it is
   to pray in the Holy Ghost? and whether the asserting this form of words
   to be used have not confirmed many in their atheistical blaspheming of
   the Holy Spirit of God and his grace in the prayers of his people? and
   whether the repetition of these words, after men have been long praying
   for the things contained in them, as the manner of some is, be not so
   remote from any pretence or choour of warrant in the Scripture as that
   it is, in plain terms, ridiculous? When Mr B., or any on his behalf,
   hath answered these questions, they may be supplied with more of the
   like nature and importance.

   Of our address with all our religious worship to the Father by Jesus
   Christ, the mediator, how and in what manner we do so, and in what
   sense he is himself the ultimate object of divine worship, I have
   spoken before, and therefore I shall not need to insist on his next
   question, which makes some inquiry thereabout. That which follows is
   all that in this chapter needs any animadversion. The words are
   these:--

   Q. Was it the custom during the time that Christ conversed on the earth
   (much less before he came into the world) to pray unto God in the name
   of Christ or through Christ? or did it begin to be used after the
   resurrection and exaltation of Christ? What saith Christ himself
   concerning this?

   A. John xvi. 24-26.

   The times of the saints in this world are here distinguished into
   different seasons, -- that before Christ's coming in the flesh, the
   time of his conversation on earth, and the time following his
   resurrection and exaltation. What was the custom in these several
   seasons of praying to God in the name of Christ or through him is
   inquired after; and as to the first and second it is denied, but
   granted as to the last, which is farther confirmed, in the answer to
   the last question, from Heb. xiii. 20, 21. Some brief observations will
   disentangle Mr B.'s catechumens, if they shall be pleased to attend
   unto them.

   1. It is not what was the custom of men to do, but what was the mind of
   God that they should do, that we inquire after. 2. That Jesus Christ,
   in respect of his divine nature, wherein he is one with his Father, was
   always worshipped and invocated ever since God made any creatures to
   worship him, hath been formerly declared. 3. That there is a twofold
   knowledge of Christ the mediator, -- (1.) In general, in thesi, of a
   mediator, the Messiah promised; which was the knowledge of the saints
   under the old testament. (2.) Particular, in hypothesi, that Jesus of
   Nazareth was that Messiah; which also was and is known to the saints
   under the new testament. 4. That as to an explicit knowledge of the way
   and manner of salvation, which was to be wrought, accomplished, and
   brought about, by the Messiah, the promised seed, Jesus Christ, and the
   address of men unto God by him, it was much more evidently and clearly
   given after the resurrection and the ascension of Christ than before,
   the Spirit of revelation being then poured out in a more abundant
   manner than before. 5. There is a twofold praying unto God in the name
   of Christ, -- one in express words, clear and distinct intention of
   mind, insisting on his mediation and our acceptance with God on his
   account; the other implied in all acts of faith and dependence on God,
   wherein we rely on him as the means of our access to God.

   I say, these things being premised, -- 1. That before Christ's coming
   into the world, the saints of the old testament did pray, and were
   appointed of God to pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, inasmuch as, in
   all their addresses unto God, they leaned on him, as promised to them,
   through whom they were to receive the blessing and to be blessed,
   believing that they should be accepted on his account. This was
   virtually prayer to God in the name of Christ, or through him. This is
   evident from the tenor of the covenant wherein they walked with God, in
   which they were called to look to the Seed of the woman, to expect the
   blessing in the Seed of Abraham, speaking of the Seed as of one and not
   of many; as also by all their types and sacrifices, wherein they had,
   by God's institution, respect to him, with Abraham, by faith, even as
   we: so that whether we consider the promise on the account whereof they
   came to God, which was of Christ and of blessing in him; or the means
   whereby they came, which were sacrifices and types of him; or the
   confidence wherein they came, which was of atonement and forgiveness of
   sin by him, -- it is evident that all their prayers were made to God in
   the name of Christ, and not any upon any other account. And one of them
   is express in terms to this purpose, Dan. ix. 17. If they had any
   promise of him, if any covenant in him, if any types representing him,
   if any light of him, if any longing after him, if any benefit by him or
   fruit of his mediation, all their worship of God was in him and through
   him.

   2. For them who lived with him in the days of his flesh, their faith
   and worship were of the same size and measure with theirs that went
   before, so was their address to God in the same manner and on the same
   account: only in this was their knowledge enlarged, that they believed
   that that individual person was he who was promised and on whom their
   fathers believed; and therefore they prayed to him for all mercies,
   spiritual and temporal, whereof they stood in need, as to be saved in a
   storm, to have their faith increased, and the like, though they had not
   expressly and clearly made mention of his name in their supplications.
   And that is the sense of our Saviour in the place of John insisted on,
   "Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name," -- that is, expressly and
   in direct application of the promises made in the Messiah unto him, --
   though they had their access to God really and virtually by and through
   him, in all the ways before expressed. And indeed, to evidence the
   glory of the presence of the Spirit when poured forth upon them with a
   fulness of gifts and graces, such things are recorded of their
   ignorance and darkness in the mysteries of the worship of God, that it
   is no great wonder if they, who were then also to be detained under the
   judaical pedagogue for a season, had not received as yet such an
   improvement of faith as to ask and pray in the name of Jesus Christ as
   exhibited, which was one of the great privileges reserved for the days
   of the gospel.

   And this is all that Mr B. gives occasion unto in this chapter.

Chapter XXXV.

   Of the resurrection of the dead and the state of the wicked at the last
   day.

   In his last chapter Mr Biddle strives to make his friends amends for
   all the wrong he had done them in those foregoing. Having attempted to
   overthrow their faith and to turn them aside from the simplicity of the
   gospel, he now informs them that the worst that can happen to them if
   they follow his counsel is but to be annihilated, or utterly deprived
   of their being, body and soul, in the day of judgment! For that
   everlasting fire, those endless torments, wherewith they have been so
   scared and terrified formerly by the catechisms and preachings of men
   that left and forsook the Scripture, it is all but a fable, invented to
   affright fools and children! On this account he lets his followers know
   that if, rejecting the eternal Son of God and his righteousness, they
   may not go to heaven, yet as to hell, or an everlasting abode in
   torments, they may be secure; there is no such matter provided for them
   nor any else. This is the main design in this chapter, whose title is,
   "Of the resurrection of the dead and the last judgment, and what shall
   be the final condition of the righteous and wicked thereupon."

   The first questions lead only to answers that there shall be a
   resurrection of the dead in general, and that they shall be raised and
   judged by Christ, who hath received authority from God to that purpose,
   that being the last great work that he shall accomplish by virtue of
   his mediatory kingdom committed to him. Some snares seem to be laid in
   the way in his questions, being captiously proposed; but they have been
   formerly broken in pieces in the chapters of the deity of Christ and
   his person, whither I remit the reader if he find himself entangled
   with them.

   I shall only say, by the way, that if Mr B. may be expounded by his
   masters, [520] he will scarce be found to give so clear an assent to
   the resurrection of the dead as is here pretended; that is, to a
   raising again of the same individual body for the substance and all
   substantial parts. This his masters think not possible, and therefore
   reject it, though it be never so expressly affirmed in the Scripture.
   But Mr B. is silent of this discovery made by his masters, and so shall
   I be also.

   That wherewith I am to deal he enters upon in this question:--

   Ques. Shall not the wicked and unbelievers live for ever, though in
   torments, as well as the godly and faithful? or is eternal life
   peculiar to the faithful?

   Ans. John iii. 36.

   The assertion herein couched is, that the wicked shall not live for
   ever in torments; [521] and the proof of it is, because eternal life is
   promised only to the faithful; yea, "he that believeth not the Son
   shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him," John iii. 36.
   As to the assertion itself, we shall attend farther unto it instantly.

   When Socinus first broached this abomination, he did it with the
   greatest cunning and sleight that possibly he could use, labouring to
   insinuate it insensibly into the minds of men, knowing full well how
   full of scandal the very naming of it would prove; but the man's
   success was in most things beyond his own imagination. [522]

   For the proof insinuated; "life" and "eternal life," in the gospel, as
   they are mentioned as the end and reward of our obedience, are not
   taken merely physically, nor do express only the abode, duration, and
   continuance of our being, but our continuance in a state and condition
   of blessedness and glory. This is so evident, that there is no one
   place where life to come and eternal life are spoken of simply, in the
   whole New Testament, but as they are a reward and a blessed condition
   to be obtained by Jesus Christ. In this sense we confess the wicked and
   impenitent "shall never see life," or obtain eternal life, -- that is,
   they shall never come to a fruition of God to eternity; but that
   therefore they shall not have a life or being, though in torments, is a
   wild inference. I desire to know of Mr B. whether the evil angels shall
   be consumed or no, and have an utter end? If he say they shall, he
   gives us one new notion more; if not, I ask him whether they shall have
   eternal life or no? If he say they shall not enjoy eternal life in the
   sense mentioned in the Scripture, I shall desire him to consider that
   men also may have their being preserved and yet not be partakers of
   eternal life in that sense wherein it is promised.

   The proof insisted on by Mr B. says that the wrath of God abides upon
   unbelievers, even then when they do not see life. Now, if they abide
   not, how can the wrath of God abide on them? doth God execute his wrath
   upon that which is not? If they abide under wrath, they do abide.
   "Under wrath" doth not diminish from their abiding, but describes its
   condition.

   Death and life in Scripture, ever since the giving of the first law,
   and the mention made of them therein, as they express the condition of
   man in way of reward or punishment, are not opposed naturally, but
   morally, not in respect of their being (if I may so say) and relation,
   as one is the privation of the other in the way of nature, but in
   respect of the state and condition which is expressed by the one and
   the other, -- namely, of blessedness or misery. So that as there is an
   eternal life, which is as it were a second life, a life of glory
   following a life of grace, so there is an eternal death, which is the
   second death, a death of misery following a death of sin.

   The death that is threatened, and which is opposed to life, and eternal
   life, doth not anywhere denote annihilation, but only a deprivation and
   coming short of that blessedness which is promised with life, attended
   with all the evils which come under that name and are in the first
   commination. Those who are dead in trespasses and sins are not nothing,
   though they have no life of grace. But Mr B. proceeds, and saith, --

   Q. Though this passage which you have quoted seems clearly to prove
   that eternal life agreeth to no other men but the faithful, yet, since
   the contrary opinion is generally held among Christians, I would fain
   know of you whether you have any other places that affirm that the
   wicked die directly, and that a second death, are destroyed and
   punished with everlasting destruction, are corrupted, burnt up,
   devoured, slain, pass away, and perish?

   A. Rom. vi. 23, viii. 13; Rev. xxi. 6, 8, ii. 10, 11; 1 Thess. v. 3; 2
   Pet. iii. 7; 2 Thess. i. 7-9; Gal. vi. 8; 2 Pet. ii. 12; 1 Cor. iii.
   17; Heb. x. 39; Matt. iii. 12; Heb. x. 26, 27; Luke xix. 27, 1 John ii.
   17; 2 Cor. ii. 15, 16.

   1. How well Mr B. hath proved his intention by the place of Scripture
   before mentioned hath been in part discovered, and will in our process
   yet farther appear. The ambiguity of the words "life" and "eternal
   life" (which yet are not ambiguous in the Scripture, being constantly
   used in one sense and signification as to the purpose in hand) is all
   the pretence he hath for his assertion. Besides that, his proof that
   unbelievers do not abide lies in this, that "the wrath of God abideth
   on them"!

   2. This is common with this gentleman and his masters, "Christians
   generally think otherwise, but we say thus;" so light do they make of
   the common faith, which was once delivered to the saints But he may be
   pleased to take notice that not only Christians think so, but assuredly
   believe that it shall be so, having the express word of God to bottom
   that their faith upon. And not only Christians believe it, but mankind
   generally in all ages have consented to it, as might abundantly be
   evinced. [523]

   3. But let the expressions wherewith Mr B. endeavours to make good this
   his monstrous assertion of the annihilation of the wicked and
   unbelievers at the last day be particularly considered, that the
   strength of his conclusion, or rather the weakness of it, may be
   discovered.

   The first is, that they are said to "die, and that a second death,"
   Rom. vi. 23, viii. 13; Rev. xxi. 6, 8, ii. 10, 11. But how, now, will
   Mr B. prove that by dying is meant the annihilation of body and soul?
   There is mention of a natural death in Scripture; which, though it be a
   dissolution of nature as to its essential parts of body and soul, yet
   it is an annihilation of neither, for the soul abides, and Mr B.
   professes to believe that the body shall rise again. There is a
   spiritual death in sin also mentioned; which is not a destruction of
   the dead person's being, but a moral condition wherein he is. And why
   must the last death be the annihilation pretended? As to a coming short
   of that which is the proper life of the soul, in the enjoyment of God,
   which is called "life" absolutely, and "eternal life," it is a death;
   and as to any comfortable attendancies of a being continued, it is a
   death. That it is a total deprivation of being, seeing those under it
   are to eternity to abide under torments (as shall be showed), there is
   no colour.

   2. It is called "destruction," and "perdition," and "everlasting
   destruction," 1 Thess. v. 3; 2 Pet. iii. 7; 2 Thess. i. 7-9. True, it
   is a destruction as to the utter casting men off from all and every
   thing wherein they had any hope or dependence, -- a casting them
   eternally off from the happiness of rational creatures, and the end
   which they ought to have aimed at; that is, they shall be destroyed in
   a moral, not a natural sense. To be cast for ever under the wrath of
   God, I think, is destruction; and therefore it is called "everlasting
   destruction," because of the punishment which in that destruction
   abideth on them. To this are reduced the following expressions of
   "utterly perishing," and the like, Gal. vi. 8; 2 Pet. ii. 12; 1 Cor.
   iii. 17; 2 Pet. iii. 16.

   3. "Burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire" is mentioned, Matt.
   iii. 12; but if this burning of the chaff do consume it, pray what need
   it be done with "fire that cannot be quenched?" When it hath done its
   work, it will surely be put out. The expression is metaphorical, and
   the allusion is not in the consumption of chaff in the fire, but in the
   casting it into the fire, or the setting fire unto it. So the "fiery
   indignation" is said to "devour the adversaries," Heb. x. 27; not that
   they shall no more be, but that they shall never see happiness any
   more. All these expressions are metaphorical, and used to set out the
   greatness of the wrath and indignation of God against impenitent
   sinners, under which they shall lie for ever. The residue of the
   expressions collected are of the same importance. Christ's punishment
   of unbelievers at the last day is compared to a king saying, "Bring
   hither mine enemies, and slay them before me," Luke xix. 27; because as
   a natural death is the utmost punishment that men are able to inflict,
   which cuts men off from hopes and enjoyments as to their natural
   condition, so Christ will lay on them the utmost of his wrath, cutting
   them off from all hopes and enjoyments as to their spiritual and moral
   condition. It is said, "The world passeth away," because it can give no
   abiding, continuing refreshment to any of the sons of men, when he that
   doeth the will of God hath an everlasting continuance in a good
   condition, notwithstanding the intervening of all troubles which are in
   this life,1 John ii. 17; but that wicked men have not their being
   continued to eternity nothing is here expressed.

   A very few words will put an issue to this controversy, if our blessed
   Saviour may be accepted for an umpire. Saith he, Matt. xxv. 46, "These
   shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life
   eternal." Certainly he that shall be everlastingly punished shall be
   everlastingly. His punishment shall not continue when he is not. He
   that hath an end cannot be everlastingly punished. Again, saith our
   Saviour, "In hell the fire never shall be quenched; where the worm
   dieth not, and the fire is not quenched," Mark ix. 43, 44; which he
   repeats again verse 46, and, that Mr B. may not cause any to hope the
   contrary, again verse 48. This adds to the former miracle, -- that men
   should be punished and yet not be, -- that they shall be punished by
   the stings of a worm to torment them when they are not, and the burning
   of a fire when their whole essence is consumed! So also Isa. lxvi. 24,
   their torments shall be endless, and the means of their torments
   continued for ever; but for themselves, it seems, they shall have an
   end as to their being, and so nothing shall be punished with an
   everlasting worm and a fire never to be quenched! Nay, which is more,
   there shall be amongst them "weeping, and gnashing of teeth," Matt.
   viii. 12, the utmost sorrow and indignation expressible, yea, beyond
   expression, and yet they shall not be! God threatens men with death and
   destruction, and describes that death and destruction to consist in the
   abiding under his wrath in endless torments; which inexpressible state
   evidently shows that death is not a consumption of them as to the
   continuance of their being, but a deprivation of all the good of life
   natural, spiritual, and eternal, with an infliction of the greatest
   evils that they can be capacitated to endure and undergo, called their
   "destruction and perdition." [524]

   What hath been the intention and design of Mr B. in this his Catechism,
   which I have thus far considered, I shall not judge. There is one
   Lawgiver to whom both he and I must give an account of our labour and
   endeavours in this business. That the tendency of the work itself is to
   increase infidelity and sin in the world I dare aver. Let this chapter
   be an instance; and from the savour that it hath let a taste be taken
   of the whole, and its nature be thereby estimated. That the greatest
   part of them to whom the mind of God, as revealed in Scripture, is in
   some measure made known, are not won and prevailed upon by the grace,
   love, and mercy, proclaimed therein and tendered through Christ, so as
   to give up themselves in all holy obedience unto God, I suppose will be
   granted. That these men are yet so overpowered by the terror of the
   Lord therein discovered, and the threats of the wrath to come, as not
   to dare to run out to the utmost that the desperate thoughts of their
   own hearts and the temptations of Satan meeting in conjunction would
   carry them unto, as it hath daily and manifold experiences to evince
   it, so the examples of men so awed by conviction mentioned in the
   Scripture do abundantly manifest. Now, what is it, among all the
   considerations of the account that men are to make and the judgment
   which they are to undergo, which doth so amaze their souls and fill
   them with horror and astonishment, so strike off their hands when they
   are ready to stretch them out to violence and uncleanness, or so
   frequently make their conception of sin abortive, as this of the
   eternity of the punishment which impenitent sinners must undergo? Is
   not this that which makes bitter the otherwise sweet morsels that they
   roll under their tongues, and is an adamantine chain to coerce and
   restrain them, when they break all other cords and cast all other bonds
   behind them? Yea, hath not this been, from the creation of the world,
   the great engine of the providence of God for the preserving of mankind
   from the outrageousness and unmeasurableness of iniquity and
   wickedness, which would utterly ruin all human society, and work a
   degeneracy in mankind into a very near approximation unto the beasts
   that perish, -- namely, by keeping alive, in the generality of rational
   creatures, a prevailing conviction of an abiding condition of evil
   doers in a state of misery? [525] To undeceive the wretched world, and
   to set sinful man at liberty from this bondage and thraldom to his own
   causeless fears, Mr B. comes forth and assures them all that the
   eternity of torments is a fable, and everlasting punishment a lie. Let
   them trouble themselves no more; the worst of their misery may be past
   in a moment. It is but annihilation, or rather perdition of soul and
   body, and they are for ever freed from the wrath of the Almighty! Will
   they not say, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die?" Down
   we lie of a season; God, it seems, will see us once again, and then
   farewell for ever. Whether ever there were a more compendious way of
   serving the design of Satan, or a more expedient engine to cast down
   and demolish the banks and bounds given to the bottomless lust and
   corruption of natural men, that they may overflow the world with a
   deluge of sin and confusion, considering the depraved condition of all
   men by nature and the rebellion of the most against the love and mercy
   of the gospel, I much doubt. But who is more fit to encourage wicked
   men to sin and disobedience than he who labours also to pervert the
   righteous and obedient from their faith?

   To close this whole discourse, I shall present Mr B.'s catechumens with
   a shorter catechism than either of his, collected out of their master's
   questions, with some few inferences naturally flowing from them; and it
   is as follows:--

   Ques. 1. What is God?

   Ans. God is a spirit, that hath a bodily shape, eyes, ears, hands,
   feet, like to us.

   Q. 2. Where is this God?

   A. In a certain place in heaven, upon a throne, where a man may see
   from his right hand to his left.

   Q. 3. Doth he ever move out of that place?

   A. I cannot tell what he doth ordinarily, but he hath formerly come
   down sometimes upon the earth.

   Q. 4. What doth he do there in that place?

   A. Among other things, he conjectures at what men will do here below.

   Q. 5. Doth he, then, not know what we do?

   A. He doth know what we have done, but not what we will do.

   Q. 6. What frame is he in upon his knowledge and conjecture?

   A. Sometimes he is afraid, sometimes grieved, sometimes joyful, and
   sometimes troubled.

   Q. 7. What peace and comfort can I have in committing myself to his
   providence, if he knows not what will befall me to-morrow?

   A. What is that to me? see you to that.

   Q. 8. Is Jesus Christ God?

   A. He is dignified with the title of God, but he is not God.

   Q. 9. Why, then, was he called the only-begotten son of God?

   A. Because he was born of the Virgin Mary.

   Q. 10. Was he Christ the Lord then when he was born?

   A. No; he became the Lord afterward.

   Q. 11. Hath he stilt in heaven a human body?

   A. No; but he is made a spirit: so that being not God, but man, he was
   made a god, and being made a god, he is a spirit, and not a man.

   Q. 12. What is the Holy Ghost?

   A. A principal angel.

   Q. 13. Did death enter by sin, or was mortality actually caused by sin?

   A. No.

   Q. 14. Why is Christ called a saviour?

   A. Because at the resurrection he shall change our vile bodies.

   Q. 15. On what other account?

   A. None that I know of.

   Q. 16. How then shall I be saved from sin and wrath?

   A. Keep the commandments, that thou mayst have a right to eternal life.

   Q. 17. Was Christ the eternal son of God in his bosom, revealing his
   mind from thence, or was he taken up into heaven, and there taught the
   truths of God, as Mohammed pretended?

   A. He ascended into heaven, and talked with God before he came and
   showed himself to the world.

   Q. 18. What did Christ do as a prophet?

   A. He gave a new law.

   Q. 19. Wherein.?

   A. He corrected the law of Moses.

   Q. 20. Who was it that said of old," Thou shalt love thy neighbour and
   hate thine enemy?"

   A. God, in the law of Moses, which Christ corrects.

   Q. 21. Is Christ to be worshipped because he is God?

   A. No, but because he redeemed us.

   Q. 22. May one that is a mere creature be worshipped with divine or
   religious worship?

   A. Yes.

   Q. 23. How can Christ, being a mere man, and now so far removed from
   the earth, understand and hear all the prayers and desires of the
   hearts of men that are put up to him all the world over?

   A. I cannot tell, for God himself doth not know that there are such
   actions as our free actions are but upon inquiry.

   Q. 24. Did Christ give himself for an offering and sacrifice to God in
   his death?

   A. No; for he was not then a priest.

   Q. 25. Did Christ by his death make reconciliation for our sins, the
   sins of his people, and bear their iniquities, that they might have
   peace with God?

   A. No, but only died that they might turn themselves to God.

   Q. 26. Did he so undergo the curse of the law, and was he so made sin
   for us, were our iniquities so laid on him, that he made satisfaction
   to God for our sins?

   A. No; there is no such thing in the Scripture.

   Q. 27. Did he merit or procure eternal life for us by his obedience and
   suffering?

   A. No; this is a fiction of the generality of Christians.

   Q. 28. Did he redeem us properly with the price of his blood, that we
   should be saved from wrath, death, and hell?

   A. No; there is no such use or fruit of his death and blood-shedding.

   Q. 29. If he neither suffered in our stead, nor underwent the curse of
   the law for us, nor satisfied justice by making reconciliation for our
   sins, nor redeemed us by the price of his blood, what did he do for us,
   -- on what account is he our saviour?

   A. He taught us the way to heaven, and died to leave us an example.

   Q. 30. How then did he save them, or was he their saviour, who died
   before his teaching and dying?

   A. He did not save them, nor was their saviour, nor did they ask any
   thing in his name, or receive any thing on his account.

   Q. 31. Did Christ raise himself, according as he spake of the temple of
   his body, "Destroy this temple, and the third day I will raise it
   again?"

   A. No, he raised not himself at all.

   Q. 32. Hath God from eternity loved some even before they did any good,
   and elected them to life and salvation, to be obtained by Jesus Christ?

   A. No, but he loved all alike.

   Q. 33. Did God in the sending of Christ aim at the salvation era
   certain number, or his elect?

   A. No, but at the salvation of men in general, whether ever any be
   saved or no.

   Q. 34. Are all those saved for whom Christ died?

   A. The least part of them are saved.

   Q. 35. Is faith wrought in us by the Spirit of God, or are we converted
   by the efficacy of his grace?

   A. No, but of ourselves we believe and are converted, and then we are
   made partakers of the Spirit and his grace.

   Q. 36. Are all true believers preserved by the power of God unto
   salvation?

   A. No, many of them fall away and perish.

   Q. 37. Is the righteousness of Christ imputed to us for our
   justification?

   A No, but our own faith and works.

   Q. 38. Are we to receive or apprehend Christ and his righteousness by
   faith, that we may be justified through him?

   A. No, but believe on him that raised him from the dead, and without
   that it suffices.

   Q. 39. Are we able to keep all God's commandments?

   A. Yes.

   Q. 40. Perhaps in our sincere endeavours, but can we do it absolutely
   and perfectly?

   A. Yes, we can keep them perfectly.

   Q. 41. What need a man then to apprehend Christ's righteousness and
   apply it to himself by faith?

   A. None at all, for there is no such thing required.

   Q. 42. What shall become of wicked men after the resurrection?

   A. They shall be so consumed, body and soul, as not at all to remain in
   torments.

   [520] "Deinde negant resurrectionem carnis, hoc est, hujus ipsius
   corporis, quod carne ac sanguine præditum est, etsi fateantur corpora
   esse resurrectura, h. e. ipsos homines fideles; qui tunc novis
   corporibus coelestibus induendi sunt." -- Compend. Doct. Eccles. in
   Polon.

   [521] "Itaque negant cruciatus impiorum et diabolorum duraturos esse in
   seternum, verum omnes simul penitus esse abolendos; adeo ut mors et
   infernus ipse dicantur conjiciendi in stagnum illud ardens, Rev. xx.
   14. Rationem addunt, quod absurdum sit, Deum irasci in æternum; et
   peccata creaturarum finita, poenis infinitis mulctare: pracærtim cum
   hinc nulla ipsius gloria illustretur." -- Compend. Doct. Eccles. in
   Polon.

   [522] "Nam quod ais, ea ibi, tum de Christianorum resurrectione, tum de
   morte impiorum pæssim contineri, quæ a multis sine magna offensione,
   tum nostris tum aliis, legi non possint; scio equidem ea ibi contineri,
   sed meo judicio nec passim, nec ita aperte (cavi enim istud quantum
   potui) ut quisquam vir pius facile offendi possit, adeo ut quod
   nominatim attinet ad impiorum mortem, in quo dogmate majus est multo
   offensionis periculum, ea potius ex iis colligi possit, quæ ibi
   disputantur, quam expresse literis consignata extet; adeo ut lector,
   qui alioqui sententiam meam adversus Puccium de mortalitate primi
   hominis, quæ toto libro agitatur, quæque ob non paucos quos habet
   fautores parum aut nihil offensionis parere potest, probandam censeat,
   prius sentiat doctrinam istam sibi jam persuasam esse quam suaderi
   animadvertat." -- Faust. Socin. Ep. ad Johan Volkel. 6, p. 491.

   [523] All' esti kai to onti kai to anabioskesthai kai ek ton tethneoton
   tous zontas gignesthai kai tas ton tethneoton psuchas heinai kai tais
   men agathais ameinon heinai tais de kakais kakion. -- Plato in Phædone,
   17.

   [524] "A. Ita jocaris, quasi ego dicam, eos esse miseros, qui nati non
   sunt, et non eos miseros, qui mortui sunt. M. Esse ergo eos dicis. A.
   Immo, quia non sunt, cum fuerint, eos miseros esse. M. Pugnantia to
   loqui non vides? quid enim tam pugnat, quam non modo miserum, sed
   omnino quidquam esse qui non sit ... A. Quoniam me verbo premis,
   posthac non ira dicam, miseros esse, sed tantum, miseros, ob id ipsum
   quia non sunt. M. Non dicis igitur, miser est M. Crassus, seal tautum,
   miser M. Crassus. A. Ita plane. M. Quasi non necesse sit, quicquid isto
   modo pronunties, id ant ease, ant non esse. An tu dialecticis ne
   imbutus quidem es," etc. -- Cicer. Tuscul. Quest. lib. i. 7.

   [525] "Bene et composite Cæsar ... disseruit, falsa, credo, existimans,
   quæ de infernis memorantur; diverso itinere malos a bonis loca tetra,
   inculta, festa atque formidolosa, habere." -- Cato, apud Sallust. Bell
   Catilin. 52.

       ex illis tabulis cerave recitata sunt sine dolo malo, utique ea hic
       hodie rectissime intellecta sunt, illis legibus papulus Romanus
       prior non deficiet. Si prior defexit publico consilio, dolo malo;
       tu illo Diespiter, populum Romaaum sic ferito, ut ego hunc porcum
       hie hodie feriam: tantoque magis ferito quanto magis potes
       pollesque.' Id ubi dixit, porcum saxo silice percussit.: [6650]1
     * Post mihi non simili poena commissa luetis.' Luetis, persolvetis,
       et hic sermo a pecunia descendit, antiquorum enim poenæ omnes
       pecuniariæ fuerunt: [6651]1
     * Propter soelus populi mei percussi eum.': [6652]1
     * (puta inter Deum et populum Israel aut prisoi foederis), neque eum
       satisfecisse Deo ullo modo constet, ne hinc quidem, quod mediator
       Dei et hominum Christus sit, colligi certo poterit eum
       satisfactionem aliquam qua Deo pro peccatis nostris satisfieret
       peregisse.: [6653]1

       semper refertur; quare ex ejusmodi locis non potest ullo modo quod
       volunt effici. Materia vero subjecta: [6654]1

     * , seu verisimiliter eventura, pro ratione causarum unde pendent.:
       [6656]1
     * , vix ac ne vix quidem istorum blasphemorum fraudes detegi, et
       errores satis perspicue coargui posse. Nego quoque sublatis
       vocabulis naturæ, proprietatis, hypostaticæ unionis, : [6657]1

     * A quatenus ad omne valet argumentum.: [6659]1
     * Abrabinel tam avide a Judais passim conquiritur, at vix tandem ejus
       compos fieri potuerim. Nam eum Christiani superiorem putant; qui
       solide eorum argumenta,: [6660]1
     * Ad hæc vero quod nos Deo reconciliarit quid affers? -- Primum,
       nusquam Scripturam asserere Deum nobis a Christo reconciliatum,
       verum id tantum, quod nos per Christum, aut mortem ejus, simus
       reconciliati, vel Deo reconciliati, ut ex omnibus locis quæ de hac
       reconciliatione agunt videre est. Quare nullo modo ex iis omnibus
       locis ea satisfactio extrui potest. Deinde vero quod aperte in
       Scripturis extat, Deum nos sibi reconciliasse, id opinionem
       adversariorum prorsus falsam esse evincit: [6661]1
     * Ad hanc legem animus noster aptandus est, hanc sequatur, huic
       pareat, et quæcunque fiunt, debuisse fieri putet.: [6662]1
     * Ad illa omnia testimonia ego possum respondere.: [6663]1
     * Ad justitiam veto perducuntur etiam sine labore: [6664]1
     * Ad octavum veto quid? -- Primum igitur sic habeto, neque in Græca
       editione uila hæc (excepta Complutensi), nec in editione Syriaca,
       vocem Deus haberi. Verum etiamsi vex haberetur in omnibus
       exemplaribus, num idcireo ea vex the ad Deum erit referenda? Non
       certe; non solum ob eam causam quam paulo superius attulimus, in
       responsione ad testimonium tertium, quod verba ejusmodi non semper
       ad propinquiores personas referantur, verum etiam quod : [6665]1
     * Ad omnia ita responderi potest, ut appareat nullo modo ex iis
       effici divinam in Christo esse naturam; etenim aliam ob causam ea
       quæ de Deo dicta sunt sub lege, dici potuerunt de Christo sub
       evangelio, quemadmodum et dicta sunt, nimirum propter illam summam
       quæ inter Deum et Christum est, ratione imperii, potestatis, atque
       muneris, conjunctionem, quæ onmia illum Dei dono consecutum esse
       scripturæ Novi Testamenti passim testantur. Quod si Scriptura ea
       tradit de Mose, eum Israelem ex Ægypto eduxisse: [6666]1
     * Ad quartum veto quid? -- Ut rem melius accipias, scito eos ex hoc
       loco ad eum modum argumentari: Sapientia Dei ab æterno est genita;
       Christus est Dei Sapientia: ergo ab æterno est genitus: [6667]1
     * Ad quem locum Servius: Foedera dicta sunt, a porca foede et
       crudeliter occisa: nam cum ante gladiis configeretur, a fecialibus
       inventum ut silice feriretur, ea causa quod antiquum Jovis signum,
       lapidem silicem putaverunt esse.': [6668]1
     * Ad quintum quid respondes? -- Ad id testimonium id respondeo, quod
       non de Christo, verum de Deo accipiendum sit. Quia vero idem
       scriptor illud ad Filium Dei referat, expendcndum est sermonem in
       testimonio, non de una re sed de duabus, potissimum haberi
       expresse. Una est coeli et terræ creatio: altera rerum creatarum
       abolitio. Quod vero is autor priorem ad Christum non referat, hinc
       perspicuum est, quod in eo capite præstantiam Christi demonstrare
       sibi proposuerit; non cam quam a seipso habeat, verum eam quam
       hæreditavit, et qua præstantior angelis effectus sit, ut e: [6669]1
     * Ad quintum quid respondes? -- Quintum testimonium est, Expectantes
       beatem spem: [6670]1
     * Ad secundum autem quid respondes? -- Neque hic ullam
       præ-æternitatis mentionem factam expresse; nam hoc in loco Filium
       hominis, id est, hominem in coelis fuisse testatur Sriptura, quem
       citra ullam controversiam præ-æternum non extitisse certum est.:
       [6671]1
     * Ad secundum quid respondes? -- Neque hic extare quod adversa pars
       confectum velit. Aliud enim est quod hic apostolus ait, Cum in
       forma Dei esset, forman servi assumpsit: [6672]1
     * Ad secundum vero quid respondes? -- Locum Zechariæ ad hunc modum
       citant: Hoc dicit Dominus exercitum; Post gloriam misit me ad
       gentes, quæ vos spoliarunt: qui enim vos tangit, tangit pupillam
       oculi mei: [6673]1
     * Ad secundum vero quid? -- Neque in ea de generatione ex essentia
       Patris, nec de generatione præ-æterna prorsus quicquam haberi;
       etenim vox hodie: [6674]1
     * Ad te quod attinet, amino es tu quidem ad omnem doctrinæ rationem,
       ac veritatis investigationem nato, magna rerum, sophisticarum
       cognitio, orator summus, et theologus cum proipuis totius Europæ
       ingeniis certare.: [6675]1
     * Ad tertium vero quid respondes? -- Primum quidem, quod in multis
       exemplaribus vetustis, et in ipsa Vulgata, non legatur vox Deus;
       quare ex eo loco certum nihil concludi potest. Deinde, etiamsi ea
       vox legeretur, nullam esse causam cur ad Patrem referri non possit,
       cum hæc de Patre affirmari possint, eum apparuisse in Christo, et
       apostolis, qui caro fuerunt. Quod autem inferius legitur, secundum
       usitatam versionem, Receptus est in gloriam: [6676]1
     * Adamus instar infantis vel pueri se nudum esse ignoravit.: [6677]1
     * Adde quod corpus mortale, quo Christus ante mortem, imo ante suum
       in coelum ascensum præditus erat, ad hoc sacerdotium obeundum et
       sacrificium penitus absolvendum aptum non fuit; ideoque tunc demum
       corpus, huic rei accommodatum perfectum ei fuisse, divinus author
       indicat: [6678]1
     * Addit Hincmarus Opusculo 55. illud: [6679]1
     * Ais igitur adversus id quod a me affirmatum fuerat, in controversis
       dogmatibus probandis, aut improbandis, necesse esse literam
       adferre, et id quod asseritur manifeste demonstrare: id quod
       asseritur manifeste demonstrari debere plane concede; literam autem
       adferre necesse esse prorsus nego; me autem jure hoc facere id
       aperte confirmat, quod quædam dogmata in Christi ecclesia
       receptissima, non solum per expressam literam non probantur, sed
       ipsam sibi contrariam habent. Exempli causa, inter omnes fete
       Christiani nominis heroines receptissimum est, Deum non habere
       aliqua membra corporis, ut aures, oculos, nares, brachia, pedes,
       marius, et tamen non mode expresse et literaliter (ut vocant) id
       scripture in sacris libris non est: verum etiam contrarium omnino
       passim diserte scriptum extat.: [6680]1
     * Aliam interim cum Francisco Puccio ineunte anno 1578, Tiguri
       confecit.: [6681]1
     * Aliqui Judæi mihi confessi sunt, rabbinos suos ex propheticis
       scripturis facile se extricare potuisse, modo Esaias tacuisset.:
       [6682]1
     * Aliqui fratrum putant congerendis pecuniis me nunc prorsus intentum
       esse.: [6683]1
     * Aliud interim in Latina lingua erratum, gravius quam istud sit, a
       me est commissum, quod scilicet relativo reciproco ubi nullus erat
       locus usus sum.: [6684]1
     * Amplissimo clarissimoque viro Georgio Blandratæ Stephani
       invictissimi regis : [6685]1
     * An Photiniani ullo modo Christiani diciqueant: [6686]1
     * Angelus Jehovæ: [6687]1
     * Animadvertendum est, hic Davidem non agere de quibusvis hominibus,
       sed de se tantum, nec simpliciter, sed habita ratione lapsus sui;
       et eo loquendi modo usum esse, cujus exemplum apud eundem Davidem
       habes: [6688]1
     * Anno 1579, jam quadragenarius migravit in Poloniam.: [6689]1
     * Ante omnia Deus erat solus ipse sibi, et locus, et mundus, et
       omnia: [6690]1
     * Ariani Christo divinum cultum non.tribuerunt. Atqui longe præstat
       Trinitarium esse quam Christo divinum cultum non tribuere. Imo
       Trinitarius (meo quidem judicio) modo alioqui Christi præcepta
       conserver, nec ulla ratione eos persequatur, qui Trinitarii non
       sunt sed potius cum ipsis fraterne conferre, ac veritatem inquirere
       non recuset, merito Christianus dici debet. Qui vero Christum
       divina ratione non colit, is hullo mode Christianus dici potest:
       Quocirca non est dubitandum, quin Deo minus displicuerunt
       Homo-ousiani Trinitarii, quam vulgus Arianorum. Quid igitur mirum,
       si cum totus fere orbis Christianus in has duas (ut ita dicam)
       factiones divisus esset Deus visionibus et miraculis testari
       voluisset utram ipsarum viam salutis vel adhuc retineret, vel jam
       abjecisset. Adde Arianos acerrime tunc persecutos fuisse miseros
       Homo-ousianos, idque diu et variis in locis: quare merito se Deus
       Arianis iratum ostendit.: [6691]1
     * Arianos nullo modo Christianos dici posse: [6692]1
     * Armati, Jovis ante aras, paterasque tenentes: [6693]1
     * Asaph iis hominibus quos deos et filios Altissimi: [6694]1
     * At Deus ipsius vice viros potentes quidem, sed improbos, sacerdotes
       nempe mortem Jeremiæ machinatos, morti dedit per Chaldæos: [6695]1
     * At Paulus ait: [6696]1
     * At horum verborum, Christum pro nobis esse mortuum: [6697]1
     * At me pertentant dum gaudia, vulnera lambo: [6698]1
     * At quæ scriptura Christum Patrem æternitatis vocat?: [6699]1
     * At remissioni gratuitæ nihil adversatur magis quam sstisfactio. Cui
       enim creditori satisfit vel ab ipso debitore, vel ab alio debitoris
       nomine, de eo dlci non potest vere eum debitum gratuito ex ipsa
       gratis remisisse.: [6700]1
     * Atqui illi e Scripturis illam divinam in Christo naturam asserere
       conantur? -- Conantur quidem variis modis; idque dum student aut e
       scripturis quibusdam evincere quæ in iis non habentur, aut dum ex
       iis quæ in scripturis habentur perperam ratiocinantur, ac male rem
       suam conficiunt.: [6701]1
     * Audivimus ex iis qui familiariter ipso sunt usi, eum significasse,
       sicut tum jactabatur, excellens sibi si contingeret adversarius,
       qui librum de Jesu Christo Servatore adoriretur, tum demure se
       totum hoc argumentum ab origine explicaturum.: [6702]1
     * Auge piis constantiam,: [6703]1
     * Aut verba Christi sine ullo prorsus tropo interpretanda sunt, et
       proinde ex ipsis ducta argumentatio vestra, penitus dissolvetur:
       aut si tropus aliquis in Christi verbis, admittendus eat, non
       videmus cur non potius dicamus, ideo dixisse Christum filium
       hominis fuisse in coelo antequam post resurrectionem eo ascenderet,
       quia jam ante iliad tempus, non modo in coelo mente, et cogitatione
       perpetuo versabatur, verum etiam omnia coelestia, id est arcana
       quæque divinissima, et ipsa omnia quæ in coelo sunt, et fiunt, adeo
       cognita et perspecta habebat, ut ea tanquam præsentia intueretur:
       et ita quamvis in terris degens, in ipso tamen coelo commorari dici
       possit, Nam in coelo antequara moreretur revera esse potuit,
       postquam ex Maria natus est: nec solum potuit, sed (ut ita dicamus)
       debuit; si enim homo ille Paulus Christi servus, ad tertium usque
       coelum ante mortem raptus est, nullo pacto nobis verisimile sit,
       Christum ipsum ants mortem in coelo non fuisse.: [6704]1
     * Beati omnes qui confidunt in eo: [6705]1
     * Bene addit crucem, nam servorum non civium crucis erat supplicium.:
       [6706]1
     * Bene et composite Cæsar ... disseruit, falsa, credo, existimans,
       quæ de infernis memorantur; diverso itinere malos a bonis loca
       tetra, inculta, festa atque formidolosa, habere.: [6707]1
     * Bernardini Ochini Dialogos transtuli, non ut judex, sed ut
       translator; et ex ejusmodi opera ad alendam familiam quæstum facere
       solitus.: [6708]1
     * Cæteræ multitudini diem statuit, ante quam liceret sine fraude ab
       armis discedere: [6709]1
     * Cæterum ut sciatis cujus sim religionis, quamvis id scripto meo
       quod habetis ostenderim, tamen hic breviter repetam. Et primum
       quidem doctrina de Messia, seu rege illo promisso, ad meam
       religionem nihil pertinet: ham rex ille tantum Judæis promissus
       erat, sicut et bona ilia Canaan. Sic etiam circumcisio, sacrificia,
       et reliquæ ceremoniæ Mosis ad me non pertinent, sed tantum populo
       Judaico promissa, data, et mandata sunt. Neque ista fuerunt cultus
       Dei apud Judæos, sed inserviebant cultui divino, et ad cultum
       divinum deducebant Judæos. Verus autem cultus Dei quem meam
       religionem appello, est decalogus, qui est æterna, et immutabilis
       voluntas Dei; qui decalogus ideo ad me pertinet, quia etiam mihi a
       Deo datus est, non quidem per vocem sonantem de coelo, sicut populo
       Judaico, at per creationem insita est menti meæ; quia autem insitus
       decalogus, per corruptionem naturæ humanæ et pravis
       consuetudinibus, aliqua ex parte obscuratus est, ideo ad
       illustrandum eum, adhibeo vocalem decalogum, qui vocalis decalogus,
       ideo etiam ad me, et ad omnes populos pertinet, quia cum insito
       nobis decalogo consentit, imo idem ille decalogus est. Hæc est :
       [6710]1
     * Calumniare fortiter; aliquid adhærebit.: [6711]1
     * Capitalem fraudem admittere est tale aliquid delinquere, propter
       quod capite puniendus sit: [6712]1
     * Captivus monstrat vincula, lytron habes.: [6713]1
     * Carmen Christo, quasi Deo, dicere secum invicem.: [6714]1
     * Carnificina Rabbinorum: [6715]1
     * Causam post alios hæc scribendi præcipuam tradunt omnes (veteres),
       ut veneno in Ecclesiam jam tam sparso, authoritate sua, quæ apud
       omnes Christianum nomen profitentes non poterat non esse maxima,
       medicinam faceret.: [6716]1
     * Causam quare Deus futura contingentia præsciat damus hanc, quod sit
       infinita ipsius intellectus perfectio omnia cognoscentis. Et sicut
       Deus cognoscit præterita secundum esse quod habuerunt, ita etiam
       cognoscit futura secundum illud esse quod habitura sunt.: [6717]1
     * Cedo etiam qui hæc opinio est perniciosa? -- Ad eum modum, quod
       hominibus fenestram ad peccandi licentiam aperiat, aut certe ad
       socordiam in pietate colenda eos invitet. Scriptura vero testatur,
       cum inter alios Christi mortis finem esse, ut redimeremur ab omni
       iniquitate, ex hoc seculo nequam eriperemur, et redimeremur ex vana
       conversatione a patribus tradita, et mundaremur conscientia a
       mortuis operibus ad serviendum Deo viventi,: [6718]1
     * Cedo qui istud rationi repugnat? -- Id quidem hinc perspicuum est,
       quod sequeretur Christum æternam mortem subiisæ, si Deo pro
       peccatis nostris satisfecisset, cum constet poenam quam homines
       peccatis meruerant ætornam mortem esse. Deinde consequeretur nos
       Christo quam Dee ipsi devinctiores ease, quippe qui satisfactione
       multum gratiæ nobis ostendisset; Deus veto exacta satisfactione,
       nulla prorsus gratia nos prosecutus fuisset.: [6719]1
     * Cedo qui rationi sanæ repugnat? -- Primo, ad eum modum, quod duæ
       substantiæ, proprietatibus adversæ, coire in unam personam
       nequeant; ut sunt mortalem et immortalem esse, principium habere et
       principio carere, mutabilem et immutabilem existere. Deinde, quod
       dues natures, personam singulæ constituentes, in unam personam
       convenire itidem nequeant; nam loco unius duas personas esse
       operteret, atque ita duos Christos existere, quem unum esse, et
       unam ipsius personam omnes citra omnem controversiam agnoscunt.:
       [6720]1
     * Certum autem est, nec fideles pro fratribus cuiquam satisfacere,
       neque Paulum cuiquam pro ecclesia satisfecisse.: [6721]1
     * Certum est illum in ipso initio mensis Junii carceri inclusum
       fuisse, et vixisse usquead mensem Novembris, nisi vehementer
       fallor, quo extinctus est.: [6722]1
     * Certum est per Verbum creata omnia: [6723]1
     * Christi doctrina non modo philosophiæ sed et : [6724]1
     * Christum Dominum invocare possumus, sed non debemus, sive non
       tenemur.: [6725]1
     * Christus: [6726]1
     * Christus per obedientiam suam (maxime in morte) et preces ei
       accedentes, hoc a Patre obtinuit, ne is humanum genus gravibus
       peccatis immersum desereret atque obduraret, sed viam illis daret
       ad justitiam perveniendi per Christum: [6727]1
     * Christus sit, Omnia quæ Pater habet mea sunt: [6728]1
     * Cognitione sui: [6729]1
     * Comparatio est sumpta a discipulo qui magistrum sibi præeuntem
       diligenter intuetur, ut imitari possit.: [6730]1
     * Conceptus enim est de Spiritu Sancto, et natus ex Virgine Maria; ob
       id genus conceptionis, et nativitatis modum, Filius etiam Dei ab
       ipso angelo vocatus fuit, et ita naturalis Dei Filius (quia
       scilicet falls natus fuit) dici vere potest. Solus Jesus Christus a
       Deo Patre suo absque opera viri in lumen productus est.: [6731]1
     * Concludimus igitur, nullum, improprie etiam loquendo, peccatum
       originale esse; id est, ex peccato illo primi parentis nullam labem
       aut pravitatem universo humano generi necessario ingenitam esse,
       sive inflictam quodammodo fuisse.: [6732]1
     * Condæo succedit Coliguius, vir natalibus et militia clarus, qui
       nisi regi suo moveret bellum, dissidii fomes et caput, virtutis
       heroicæ exemplar erat, supra antiquos duces, quos mirata est
       Græcia, quos Roma extulit.: [6733]1
     * Connectit quod dixerat cum superioribus. Si Patris potestati eripi
       non poterunt, nec meæ poterunt; nam mea potestas a Patre emanat, et
       quidem ita, ut tantundem valeat a me, aut a Patre, custodiri:
       [6734]1
     * Connectit quod dixerat cum superioribus; Si Patris potestati eripi
       non poterunt, nec meæ poterunt: nam mea potestas a Patre emanat, et
       quidem ita, ut tantundem valeat a me: [6735]1
     * Consanguinitatis jure redimito: [6736]1
     * Constat igitur (ut ad propositum revertamur), Christum ante
       resurrectionem Dei Filium plene et perfecte non fuisse: cum illi et
       immortalitatis et absoluti domiuii cum Deo similitudo deesset.:
       [6737]1
     * Contigerat nostras infamia temporis aures:: [6738]1
     * Convicti de uno Deo, cum id negare non possunt, ipsum se colere,
       afrmant, verum hoc sibi placere, ut Jupiter nominetur: [6739]1
     * Credat Apella: [6740]1
     * Cum Basiliæ degeret ad annum usque 1575 dum lumen sibi exortum, ad
       alios prostudet, ab amicis ad alienos senmm dilapso disserendi
       argumento, disputationem Christo Servatore, ore primum inchoatam,
       postea scripto complexus est: cui anno summam manum imposuit.:
       [6741]1
     * Cum Gentilis de Paulo Alciato sodali suo rogaretur, factus est'
       inquit Mahometanus.': [6742]1
     * Cum amicorum precibus permotus tandem constituisset, atque etiam
       coepisset, saltem inter ipsos, nonnulla in apertum proferre.:
       [6743]1
     * Cum diutius non possint in ecclesia delitescere, manifesto
       schismate Petricoviæ, anno 1562, habito prius colloquio eam
       scindunt et in sententiam suam pertrahunt plurimos tum ex
       ministris, tum ex patronis. Ministri qui part em eorum.sequebantur
       erant in principio Gregorlus Pauli: [6744]1
     * Cum dixeris initio, hanc viam quæ ad immortalitatem ducat esse
       divinitus patefactam, scire velim cur id abs to dictum sit? --
       Propterea, quia ut homo natura nihil habet commune cum
       immortalitate, ita eam ipse viam, quæ nos ad immortalitatem
       duceret, nulla ratione per se cognoscere potuit.: [6745]1
     * Cum ergo Deus omnia prout reipsa se habent cognoscat, : [6746]1
     * Cum his Antitrinitariis publicam habuerunt evangelici disputationem
       Petricoviæ in comitiis regni Sigism. 11 Aug., rege permittente,
       anno 1565. Disputatores fuerunt: [6747]1
     * Cum igitur nulla ratio, nullus sacrarum literarum locus sit, ex quo
       aperte colligi possit, Deum omnia quæ fiunt, scivisse antequam
       fierent, concludendum est, minime asserendam esse a nobis istam Dei
       præscientiam: præsertim, cum et rationes non paucæ, et sacra
       testimonia non desint, unde eam plane negandam esse apparet.:
       [6748]1
     * Cum in eo agatur de eo qui crueifixus sit, apparet ex eo naturam
       divinam non probari, cum de hac illud dici nequeat, verum de
       heroine, qui ideo Dominus gloriæ dicitur, hoc est, Dominus
       gloriosus, quod a Deo gloria et honore coronatus sit.: [6749]1
     * Cum ipse mortalis esset, se tamen mortalem esse nesciverit.:
       [6750]1
     * Cum itaque nuper, libellus de Christi divinitate conscriptus, esset
       mihi a pastore meo, viro cum primis pio et literato, oblatus, in
       quo -- disseruit.: [6751]1
     * Cum primum fatendi verbum in tuis verbis animadverti, sperabam to
       potius nuliam in tua vita scripturæ interpretationem audivisse, quæ
       hac sit acutior aut verior; quæque magis divinum quid sapiat, et a
       Deo ipso patefactum fuisse præ se ferat. Ego quidem certe non leves
       conjecturas habeo, ilium, qui primus setate nostra eam in lucem
       pertulit (hic autem is fuit, qui primus quoque sententiam de
       Christi origine, quam ego constanter defendo renovavit) precibus
       multis ab ipso Christo impetrasse. Hoc profecto affirmare ausim,
       cum Deus illi viro permulta, aliia prorsus tunc temporis incognita,
       patefecerit, vix quidquam inter ilia omnia esse quod
       interpretatione hac divinius videri queat.: [6752]1
     * Cum similis esset hominibus: [6753]1
     * Cum vero consideratur ut sacerdos, -- etsi similitudinem refert
       ejus, qui Deo aliquid hominum nomine præstet, -- si tamen rem ipsam
       penitus spectes, deprehendes talem eum esse sacerdotem, qui Dei
       nomine nobis aliquod præstet.: [6754]1
     * Cum vero illi ostendunt, Christum sic ex natura divina et humana
       constare, quemadmodum homo ex animo et corpore constet, quid illis
       respondendum? -- Permagnum hic esse discrimen; illi enim aiunt,
       duas naturas in Christo ita unitas esse, ut Christus sit Deus et
       homo. Anima vero et corpus ad eum modum in homine conjuneta sunt,
       ut nec anima nec corpus ipse homo sit, nec enim anima nec corpus
       sigillatim personam constituunt. At ut natura divina per se
       constituit personam, ita humana constituat per se necesse est:
       [6755]1
     * Cur vero addidit Johannes, quod sine eo factum est nihil quod
       factum est: [6756]1
     * Cur vero nihil commune habet homo cum immortalitate? -- Idcirco,
       quod ab initio de humo formatus, proptereaque mortalis creatus
       fuerit; deinde vero, quod mandatum Dei, ipsi propositum,
       transgressus sit; ideoque decreto Dei ipsius in mandato expresso,
       æternæ morti necessario subjectus fuerit.: [6757]1
     * Dabitur. Ezechias patri Achazo multum dissimilis. Sic tamen ut
       multo excellentius hæc ad Messiam pertinere, non Christiani tantum
       agnoscant, sed et Chaldæus hoc loco: [6758]1
     * De Adamo, eum immortalem creatum non fuisse, res apertissima est.
       Nam ex terra creatus, cibis usus, liberis gignendis destinatus, et
       animalis ante lapsum fuit.: [6759]1
     * De Georgio Blandrata, pro singulari suo in ecclesiam Dei amore
       præmonuit Polonos Cl. vir Johan. Cal. quinetiam illustrissimum
       principem palatinum, Vilocensem, Nicolaum Radzivilium, cujus
       patrocinio Blandrata tum utebatur. Subolfecerat enim vir doctus
       Blandratæ ingenium ad Serveti sententiam esse compositum: itaque
       serius principi suasor fuit, ut sibi ab eo caveret: sed homo ille
       facile, technis suis fallacibus, optimo principi fucum fecit, adeo
       ut ille iratus Johanni Calvino, Blandratam nomine suo ad Synodum
       Pinckzoviensem anno 1561, 25 Jun. habitam, delegaret cum literis,
       quibus serio postulabat in causa Blandratæ, cum ecclesia,
       dicebatque male et præcipitanter egisse Calvinum, quod Blandratam
       traduceret, et Servetismi notaret.: [6760]1
     * De carcere et de judicio ablatus est.: [6761]1
     * De conjuge propria, non nisi sensibus obvia cognovit.: [6762]1
     * De gravissima quæstione, utrum Christus pro peccatis nostris
       justitæ divinæ satisfeceret necne? scholastica disputatio.: [6763]1
     * De liboro arbitrio: [6764]1
     * De nomine Dei, quod Jesus Christus in terris mortalis degens
       habuit: [6765]1
     * De persona Christi: [6766]1
     * De phrenesi ista in quam inciderit, aliquid sane auditum est, non
       tantum biduo ante mortem sed pluribus diebus.: [6767]1
     * De præceptis Christi, quæ legi addidit: [6768]1
     * De quæstione tibiproposita non bene conjecisti, nec quam affers
       solutioonem ea probari ullo modo potest.: [6769]1
     * De tribus in una divina essentia personis anno 1562 controversiam
       moverunt, in Min. Pol. Itali quidam advenæ; præcipui autem
       assertores contra S. S. Trinitatem fuere, Georgius Blandrata
       theologus ac medicus, Petrus Statorius, Tonvillanus, Franciscus
       Lismaninus theologiæ doctor, quorum tamen ab initio opera
       reformationis valde fuit ecclesiæ Dei procliva.: [6770]1
     * De veritate meæ sententiæ tam sum certus, quam certo scio me istum
       pileum manibus tenere.: [6771]1
     * Debere vero reddi per verbum fuit, ordo verborum Johannis docet,
       qui valde inconvenienter loquutas fuisset, Sermonem carnem factum
       esse: [6772]1
     * Deinceps servum se exhibeto redemptori: [6773]1
     * Deinde dico falso ista objecta fuisse ab autoribus scripti, quod
       citat Frantzius nostris: nec enim fraterne tractarunt Franciscum
       Davidem, usque ad ipsum agonem, quanquam eum ut fratrem tractare
       non tenebantur, qui in Jesu Christi veram divinitatem tam impie
       involabat, ut dicere non dubitaret, tantum peccatum esse eum
       invocare, quantum est, si Virgo Maria invocetur,: [6774]1
     * Deinde negant resurrectionem carnis, hoc est, hujus ipsius
       corporis, quod carne ac sanguine præditum est, etsi fateantur
       corpora esse resurrectura, h. e. ipsos homines fideles; qui tunc
       novis corporibus coelestibus induendi sunt.: [6775]1
     * Deinde, quis eat qui nesciat, cum prius dictum sit, qui erat, et
       qui est: [6776]1
     * Delectatus est: [6777]1
     * Deliciisque fruar, mamma latusque tuis.: [6778]1
     * Demonstra id ordine? -- Id non haberi in Scripturis argumento est,
       quod istius opinionis assertores nunquam perspicuas scripturas
       afferunt ad probandam istam opinionem, verum quasdam consecutiones
       nectunt quibus quod asserunt efficere conantur; quas ut admittere
       sequum est cum ex Scripturis necessario adstruuntur, ita ubi
       Scripturis repugnant eas nullum vim habere certum est.: [6779]1
     * Demonstravi non modo Christum Deo nos, non autem Deum nobis
       reconciliasse, verum etiam Deum ipsum fuisse qui hanc
       reconciliationem fecerit: [6780]1
     * Denique Socinistæ recensendi mihi veniunt quia Fausto Socino, per
       Poloniam et Transylvaniam virus suum disseminante, tum nomen tum
       doctrinam sumpsere; atque hi soli, extinctis Farnesianis,
       Anabaptistis, et Francisci Davidis sectatoribus supersunt; homines
       ad fallacias et sophismata facti.: [6781]1
     * Denique cum eadem Scriptura apertissime ostendat, Jesum Christum
       omnia sua facta divina non sibi, nec alicui naturæ divinæ suæ, sed
       Patri suo vindicare solitum fuisse, planum facit, eam divinam in
       Christo naturam prorsus otiosam, ac sine omni causa futuram
       fuisse.: [6782]1
     * Denique, etiamsi de gloria ea quæ tum præscus erat, Esaiæ visa, hæc
       verba accipias, longe tamen aliud est gloriam alicujus videre, et
       aliud ipsummet videre. Et in gloria illius modus Dei vidit etiam
       Esaias gloriam Christi Domini. Ait enim ibidem vates, Plena est
       terra glora Dei: [6783]1
     * Denique, ex ea re, quod constet Deum aliter quam ex essentia
       generare, dum a Deo genitos credentes Scriptura pronunciat, ut
       videre est: [6784]1
     * Deo, Virglnique Matri, Sancto Paulo, Bruno, Alberto, Redempto,
       Francisco, Clarke, Joannæ, Catharinæ Senensi, divisque omnibus,
       quos peculiari cultu honorare desidero, omnis meus labour
       consecratus sit: [6785]1
     * Destinatione tua; ut: [6786]1
     * Detergere queo lacte, cruore queo:: [6787]1
     * Deus Factus: [6788]1
     * Deus est circulus, cujus centrum ubique, circumferentia nusquam:
       [6789]1
     * Deus nobis bene fecit: [6790]1
     * Dic matri, meus hic frater sitit, optima mater,: [6791]1
     * Dic nato, tuus hie frater mi mellee fili: [6792]1
     * Dicit propheta domui David; quoniam parvulus natus est nobis,
       Filius datus est nobis, et suscepit legem super se, ut servaret
       eam; et vocabitur nomen ejus, a facie admirabilis consilii Deus,
       vir permanens in æternum; Christus cujus pax multiplicabitur super
       nos in diebus ejus.: [6793]1
     * Dicitur Esaias vidisse gloriam Christi: [6794]1
     * Dico igitur, Christum merito dici posse Filium Dei naturalem, quia
       natus est Dei Filius, tametsi ex ipsa Dei substantia non fuerit
       generatus. Natum autem illum sub alia ratione, quam per
       generationem ex ipsius Dei substantia, probant angeli verba, Mariæ
       matri ejus dicta: [6795]1
     * Dico secessionem Racoviensium ac delirium, esse ab ecclesia rati o
       sejungendum, nisi velis conciliabula quæque amentium anicularum
       partes ecclesiæ a Christianæ ut ecclesiam appellare.: [6796]1
     * Dicunt doctores nostri L. M. omnium affiictionum quæ mundum
       ingressæ sunt, tertia pars Davidi et patriarchis obtigit, tertia
       altera seculo excisionis, ultima tertia pars regi Messiæ incumbet:
       [6797]1
     * Difficilis in perfecto mora est; naturaliterque, quod procedere non
       potest, recedit; et ut primo ad consequendos, quos priores ducimus,
       accendimur: ita, ubi aut præteriri, aut æquari cos posse
       desperavimus, studium cum spe senescit; et quod adsequi non potest,
       sequi desinit; et, velut occupatam relinquens materiam, quærit
       novam: præteritoque eo in : [6798]1
     * Disciplina pacis nostræ super Apud eum: [6799]1
     * Dispertiam ei plurimos.: [6800]1
     * Disputatio inter Faustum Socinum et Christianum Franken de honore
       Christi, id est, utrum Christus cum ipse perfectissima ratione Deus
       non sit religiosa tamen adoratione colendus sit, Habita, 14 Martii,
       anno 1584, in aula Christophori Paulicovii.: [6801]1
     * Diva parens mammæ gaudia posco tuæ.: [6802]1
     * Divina ultio: [6803]1
     * Divinitas autem Jesu Christi qualis sit, discimus ex sacris
       literis, nempe talis, quæ propter munus ipsius divinum tota ei
       tribuitur.: [6804]1
     * Dixeras paulo superius Dominum Jesum natura esse hominem; an idem
       habet naturam divinam? -- Nequaquam; nam id non solum rationi sanæ,
       verum etiam divinis literis repugnat.: [6805]1
     * Dixit R. Juchanan: Omnia videntu uno intuitu. Dixit Rab, Nachman
       filius Isaaci: Sic etiam nos didicimus; quod scripture est: [6806]1
     * Dixit Rabbi Tanchum, Quomodo omne mem quod est in medio vocis
       aperture est, et istud: [6807]1
     * Dixit heri vir amplissimus Blandrata, librum se tuum contra
       Palæologum accepisse. Habes tu unum saltem cui sis charissimus, cui
       omnia debes, qui judicio maxime polleat: cur tantum studium,
       consiliique pondus neglexisti? poteras non tantum ejus censuram
       absoluti jam libri petere, sed consilium postulare de subeundo non
       levi labore. Et possum affirmare senis consilium tibi sine dubio,
       si petivisti, profuturum fuisse.: [6808]1
     * Doce etiam, qui id repugnet Scripturæ Christum habere divinam
       naturam. -- Primum, ea ratione, quod Scriptura nobis unum tantum
       natura Deum proponat, quem superius demonstravimus esse Christi
       Patrem. Secundo, eadem Scriptura testatur, Jesum Christum natura
       esse hominem, ut superius ostensum est; quo ipso illi naturam
       adimit divinam. Tertio, quod quicquid divinum Christus habeat,
       Scriptura eum Patris dono habere aperte doceat: [6809]1
     * Dolerem quidem mirum in odum si disputatio ista sic habita fuisset,
       ut adversarii susplcor tamen nihfiommus, quatenus diputationem ab
       ipsis editam percurrendo animadvertere ac consequi conjectura
       potui, Licinii antagonistam arte disputandi et ipso superiorem
       esse, et id in ista ipsa disputatione facile plerisque constitisse:
       nam etsi (ni fallor) Licinius noster neutiquam in ea hæresi est, in
       qua non pauci ex nostris sunt, non esse Christiano homini dandam
       operam dialecticæ: [6810]1
     * Dominus et Deus proculdubio a Thoma appellatur, quia sit talis
       Dominus, qui divino modo in homines imperium habeat, et divino
       etiam illud modo exercere possit, et exerceat.: [6811]1
     * Dominus fecit occurrere in eum: [6812]1
     * Dominus justitia nostra: [6813]1
     * Duces hujus agminis Anabaptistici, et Antitrinitarii erant
       Gregorius Paulus, Daniel Bielenscius, et alii, quorum tandem aliqui
       fanatico proposito relicto, ad ecclesiam evangelicam redierunt, ut
       Daniel Bielenscius, qui Cracoviæ omnium suorum errorum publice
       poenitentiam egit, ibidemque, ecclesiæ Dei commode præfuit.:
       [6814]1
     * Duplex est adoratio, altera quidem quæ sine ullo medio dirigitur in
       Deum: altera vero per medium Christum defertur ad Deum; illa
       adoratio est soli Deo propria, hæc vero convenit Christo tantum.:
       [6815]1
     * E quibus testimoniis Scripturæ demonstrare conantur Christum (ut
       loquuntur) incarnatum esse? -- Ex iis ubi secundum eorum versionem
       legitur, Verbum caro factum est: [6816]1
     * E quibus vero testimoniis Scripturæ demonstrate conantur Christum
       (ut loquuntur) incarnatum esse? -- Ex iis ubi secundum eorum
       versionem legitur Verbum caro factum ease: [6817]1
     * E verbo redimendi non posse effici satisfactionem hanc hinc est
       planum, quod de ipso Deo in novo et in prisco foedere scribitur,
       eum redimisse populum suum ex Ægypto, eum fecisse redemptionem
       populo suo; quod Moses fuerit redemptor: [6818]1
     * Ea quæ in coelis sunt personæ (quæ subjecæ sunt Christo), sunt
       angeli, iique tam boni quam mali: quæ in coelis sunt, et personæ
       non sunt, omnia ilia continent quæcunque extra angelos vel sunt,
       vel etiam esse possunt.: [6819]1
     * Ea vero verba, Priusquam Abraham fiat: [6820]1
     * Ea veto verba, quod Christusm a Patre exierit: [6821]1
     * Ecce doctores nostri laudatæ memoriæ uno ore statuunt, et a
       majoribus acceperunt, de rege Messia sermonem esse, et doctorum L.
       M. vestigiis insistemus: [6822]1
     * Ecce intelliget servus meus: [6823]1
     * Ecce qui me comitem itineris expectant.: [6824]1
     * Ecclesiis Polonicis, quæ solum Patrem Domini Jesu summum Deum
       agnoscunt, publice adjungi ambivit, sed satis acerbe atque diu
       repulsam passus est, qua tamen ignominia minime accensus, vir, non
       tam indole quam anima instituto, ad patientiam compositus, nulla
       unquam alienati animi vestigia dedit.: [6825]1
     * Ego gloriam, quam dedisti mihi, dedi illis; ut sint unum,
       quemadmodum nos unum surnus: [6826]1
     * Ego quidem sentio, nihil in Scriptis, quæ communiter ab iis, qui
       Christiani sunt dicti, cepta, et pro divinis habita sunt,
       constanter legi, quod non sit verissimum: hocque ad divinam
       providentiam pertinere prorsus arbitror, ut ejusmodi scripta,
       nunquam depraventur aut corrumpantur, neque ex toto, neque ex
       parte.: [6827]1
     * Egregiam vero laudem!: [6828]1
     * Eminentim notionem quavis formula expressit, quia illius eminentia
       erit sublimit excellentia.: [6829]1
     * Eo stabilitatem significari volunt Hebræi, ut per mem aperture in
       fine rupturam: [6830]1
     * Erant alii quoque Antitrinitarii sectm Anabaptisticm per Bohsemiam
       et Moraviam longe lateque serpentis sectatores, qui absurdam illam
       bonorum communionem, observanturi ultro abjectis suis conditiouibus
       Racoviam se contulerunt. Novam Hierusalem ibi loci exstructuri (ut
       aiebant), ad hanc ineptam societatem plurimos invitabant nobiles:
       [6831]1
     * Ergo Dominus Jesus est purus homo?: [6832]1
     * Ergo Dominus Jesus est purus homo? -- Nullo pacto; etenim est
       conceptus e Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine, eoque ab ipsa
       conceptione et ortu Filius Dei est, ut ea de re: [6833]1
     * Ergo Redemptorem monstra to jure vocari,: [6834]1
     * Ergo parens et nate, meis advertite votis: [6835]1
     * Erraveramus jam a Manassis temporibus, alii ad alia idola; et
       permisit Deus ut ille nostro gravi crimine indignissima pateretur:
       [6836]1
     * Error commissus ex notis: [6837]1
     * Eruditione, virtute, pietate, præstantissimo viro D. Matthæo
       Radecio, amico, et domino mihi plurimum observsado, etc.
       Præstissime vir, amice, frater, ac domine plurimum observande.:
       [6838]1
     * Esse ergo eos dicis.: [6839]1
     * Est autem hæc magnitudo (ut ex iis intelligi potest, quæ de
       potentia et potestate Dei, itemque de sapientia ejus dicta sunt),
       infinita et incomprehensibilis.: [6840]1
     * Est coelum, et versus superos, quid quærimus ultra:: [6841]1
     * Est enim invocatio Jesu Christi, ex numero earum rerum, quas
       præcipere nullo modo opus est.: [6842]1
     * Est ex natura poenæ ut sit involuntaria: [6843]1
     * Est hic Moses; aut juxta alios Moses et Mahumed, super quibus Pax;
       Mosi Deus locutus est ea nocte, qua in exstasi quasi fuit in monte
       Sinai. Mahumedi vero locutus est illa nocte, qua scalis coelo
       admotis, angelos vidit ascendere, tunc enim vix jactum duarum
       sagittarum ab eo fuit: [6844]1
     * Est, quia adoratio Christi est ipsius Dei, quippe quæ in Christo
       non conquiescat, sed per eum transeat in Deum.: [6845]1
     * Estne utraque adoratio ista ejusdem speciei?: [6846]1
     * Estque Dei sedes nisi terræ, et pontus, et ær,: [6847]1
     * Et Deus humana lustro sub imagine terras.: [6848]1
     * Et Verbum fuit Deus: [6849]1
     * Et cum sceleratis reputatus est.: [6850]1
     * Et dabit impios pro sepultura, et divitem loro morte sua.: [6851]1
     * Et dico (si forte oculus super ubera tendo),: [6852]1
     * Et ego ad omnes tuos locos, Christi adorationem urgentes,
       probabilem potero responsionem affere.: [6853]1
     * Et erit loco ejus, ubi eis dictum est, Non populus meus (estis)
       vos, illic vocabuntur filii Dei viventis: [6854]1
     * Et fortium dividet spolia;: [6855]1
     * Et hæc vox de veteri creatione ad novam traducitur. Vid.: [6856]1
     * Et iniquitates eorum ipse portabit.: [6857]1
     * Et ipse peccata multorum tulit,: [6858]1
     * Et ipse sedificabit domum sanctuarii nostri, quod violatum est
       propter peccata nostra, et traditum est propter iniquitates
       nostras: [6859]1
     * Et livore ejus sanati sumus. Livors ejus: [6860]1
     * Et modo dico vobis, priusquam fiat, ut cum factum fuerit credatis:
       [6861]1
     * Et nigram mactabis ovem, lucumque : [6862]1
     * Et nos putavimus eum quasi leprosum ac percussum d Deo et
       humiliatum.: [6863]1
     * Et nunc dixi vobis usquam fiat: [6864]1
     * Et premere, et laxas sciret dare jussus habenas: [6865]1
     * Et pro transgressoribus rogavit.: [6866]1
     * Et quasi agnus: [6867]1
     * Et qui (Christus) cum esset in forma Dei: [6868]1
     * Et qui nocturnus Divum sacra legerit. Adsit: [6869]1
     * Et sane mirum est, cum bonis literis ut audio (et ex sermone quem
       simul habuimus, atque ex tuis scriptis conjicere potui), sis
       admodum excultus, te id non vidisse.: [6870]1
     * Et sunt ex iis quibuscum locutus est ipse Deus: [6871]1
     * Etenim mortem, Christus subiit, duplici ratione: partim quidem, ut
       foederis mediator, seu sponsor, et veluti testator quidem; partim
       ut sacerdos Deo ipsum oblaturus.: [6872]1
     * Etenim unum illud peccatum per se, non modo universes posteros, sed
       ne ipsum quidem Adamum, corrumpendi vim habere potuit. Dei vero
       consilio, in peccati illius pænam id factum fuisse, nec usquam
       legitur, et plane incredibile est, imo impium id cogitare.: [6873]1
     * Etiam in eo nihil prorsus de incarnatione (quam vocant) haberi;
       etenim quod apud quosdam legitur, Venit in carnem: [6874]1
     * Etiam præscientia et decreta de rebus futuris, quatenus ecclesiam
       spectant.: [6875]1
     * Etiam tunc cum in carcerem ageretur, et in locum lutosum, nihil
       fecit dixit ve iracunde.: [6876]1
     * Etsi summa est inter Deum et creaturam distantia, non tamen necesse
       est, tantam esse differentiam inter honorem Dei et creaturæ; nam
       potest Deus cui vult communicare honorem suum, Christo prsesertim,
       qui dignus est tali honore, quique non sine gravissimis causis
       adorari jubetur in sacris literis.: [6877]1
     * Eum invocare si non audeamus, Christiano nomine haud satis digni
       merito existimari possemus.: [6878]1
     * Eum quem Deus vult esse omnium judicem. Nam gloria Christi maxime
       illum diem respicit: [6879]1
     * Evangelium illud coeleste innotuit primum non per angelos, sed per
       homines mortales, et quantum extera species ferebat infirmos,
       Christum, et apostolos ejus: [6880]1
     * Evasit: [6881]1
     * Ex eo quod Christum apostolus Dominum suum vocet, natura divina
       effici nequit; nam eum primo manitfeste ab illo Patre, quem ibidem
       Deum unum fatetur, secernit, quum solum natura Deum esse superius
       docuimua Deinde, hoc ipsum quod de eo dicit, omnia per ipsum:
       [6882]1
     * Ex eo quod Verbum Dei: [6883]1
     * Ex hac actione propter quam ab omnibus Deum timens vocaberis,
       cognoscent omnes, quantus in to sit timor Dei, et quosque
       pertingat.: [6884]1
     * Ex his autem intelligitur, membra humani corperis, quæ Deo in
       sacris literis ascribuntur, uti et partes quædam aliarum
       animantium, quales sunt alæ non nisi improprie Deo tribui; siquidem
       a spiritus natura prorsus abhorrent. Tribuuntur autem Deo per
       metaphoram cum metonymia conjunctam. Nempe quis facultates vel
       actiones Deo conveniunt, illarum similes, quæ membris illis, aut
       insunt, aut per ea exercentur.: [6885]1
     * Ex iis verbis doceri non potest, apostolum affirmare, Christum in
       deserto revera tentatum fuisse; ut e simili oratione, siquis ita
       diceret, deprehendi potest. Ne sitis refractarii magistratui,
       quemadmodum quidam majorum nostrorum fuerunt;' non illico
       concluderes eundem numero magistratum utrobique designari. Quod si
       reperiuntur in Scripturis ejusmodi loquendi modi, in quibus similis
       oratio ad eum cujus nomen paulo ante expressum est, sine ulla
       illius ejusdem repetitione referatur, tum hoc ibi sit, ubi ullus
       alius præter cum cujus expressum est nomen, subintelligi possit: ut
       exemplum ejus rei habes in illo testimonio: [6886]1
     * Ex iis vero verbis, quæ apostolus paulo post subjecit, Habitu
       inventus est ut homo: [6887]1
     * Ex nobili admodum familia, quæ etiam tres cardinales habuit, natus,
       mercatura relicta se totum sacrarum literarum studio tradidit.:
       [6888]1
     * Ex quibus vero locis exstruere conantur Christum ab æterno ex
       essentia Patris genitum? -- Ex his potissimum: [6889]1
     * Exemplum denique affert nostrorum (thes. 108), quomodo se gesserint
       in Transylvania, in negotio Francisci Davidis: quomodo semetipsos
       in actu illo inter se reos agant vafritiæ, crudelitatis
       sanguinariæ, poditionis: [6890]1
     * Exemplum denique affert nostrorum, Thes. 108. Quomodo se gesserint
       in Transylvania in negotio Francisci Davidis, quomodo semetipsos in
       actu illo inter se reos agant vafriciæ, perfidiæ, crudelitatis,
       sanguinariæ proditionis: [6891]1
     * Exigitur et ipse affiigitur: [6892]1
     * Exigitur poena: [6893]1
     * Expone igitur mihi quibus testimoniis approbare contendunt Christum
       coelum et terrain creasse? -- his ubi scriptum extat, quod per eum
       omnia facta sint, et sine eo factum sit nihil quod factum sit:
       [6894]1
     * Exposuisti quæ cognitu ad salutem de essentia Dei sunt prorsus
       necessaria, expone quæ ad eam rem vehementer utilia esse censeas.:
       [6895]1
     * Expressere id nobis vota multorum, multæque etiam a remotissimis
       orbis partibus ad nos transmissæ preces.: [6896]1
     * Exsaturare queo sanguine, lacte queo.: [6897]1
     * Extat apud me ipsius Blandratæ epistola, non tamen scripta sine
       Theseo (Statorto) si Blandratum bene novi, in qua Gregorium Paulum
       a Tritheismo ad Samosateni dogma revocare nititur. Incidit enim
       Blandrata in Transylvaniam rediens in quendam Franciscum David,
       paulo magis, quam superiores illi ut aiunt providum.: [6898]1
     * Fabulas vulgaris nequitia non invenit: [6899]1
     * Facie in faciem: [6900]1
     * Fateor me credere in unum Deum Patrem, et in unum Dominum Jesum
       Christum Filium ejus, et in unum Spiritum Sanctum, quorum quilibet
       est essentialiter Deus. Deorum pluralitatem detestor, cum unus
       tantum sit nobis Deus, essentia indivisibilis. Fateor tres esse
       distinctas hypostases; et æternam Christi divinitatem et
       generationem; et Spiritum Sanctum, unum et æteruum Deum, ab utroque
       procedentem.: [6901]1
     * Fateor me per omnem vitam meam non magis contortam scripturæ
       interpretationem audivisse; ideoque eam penitus improbo.: [6902]1
     * Fecialis sumpto in manibus lapide, postquam de foedere inter partes
       convenerat, hæc verba dixit, Si recte ac sine dolo malo, hoc foedus
       atque hoc jusjurandum facio, dii mihi cuncta felicia præstent; sin
       aliter aut ago, aut cogito, cæteris omnibus salvis, in propriis
       legibus, in propriis laribus, in propriis templis, in propriis
       sepulchris, solus ego peream, ut hic lapis de manibus meis
       decidet.: [6903]1
     * Filium Dei unigenitum esse docent, tum propter sanctificationem, ac
       missionem in mundum, tum exaltationem ad Dei dextram, adeo ut
       factum Dominum et Deum nostrum affirmant.: [6904]1
     * Filium autem Dei viventis, Filium Dei proprium et unigenitum esse
       Christum, ubi habetur? -- De hoc: [6905]1
     * Fit mentio destitutionis vel carentiæ divinæ gloriæ, ergo
       privationis imaginis Dei et justitiæ et sanctitatis, ejusque
       originalis; fit mentio carentiæ divinæ gloriæ, ergo in creatione
       cum homine fuit communicata: o ineptias!: [6906]1
     * Formans simul cor eorum, intelligent omnia opera corum: [6907]1
     * Fuerat: [6908]1
     * Fuit etiam Lælius Socinus Senensis incredibiliter ad contradicendum
       et varios nectendos nodos comparatus; nec, nisi post mortem,
       cognitus hujusmodi perniciosissimis hæresibus laborare.: [6909]1
     * Fuit homo missus a Deo: [6910]1
     * Fuit is Lælius nobili honestaque familia natus, bene Græce et
       Hebraice doctus, vitæque etiam externæ inculpatæ, quarum rerum
       causa mihi quoque intercesserat cumillo non vulgaris amicitia; sed
       homo fuit plenus diversarum hæresium, quas tamen mihi nunquam
       proponebat nisi disputandi causa, et semper interrogans, quasi
       cuperet doceri. Hanc vero Samosatenianam imprimis annos multos
       fovit, et quoscunque potuit pertraxit in eundem errorem; pertraxit
       autem non paucos: me quoque ut dixi diversis tentabat rationibus,
       si eodem possit errore simul, et æterno exitio secum involvere.:
       [6911]1
     * Futuram mihi sepulchrum: ibi enim mei majores sunt siti,: [6912]1
     * Generationem ejus quis enarrabit?: [6913]1
     * Germen justum: [6914]1
     * Gitichio itaque de absoluta Dei potentia seu potestate (de qua
       nulla nobis dubitatio) inaniter blateranti, elegantissimis
       Augustini verbis respondeo, Omnia Deus potuit, sivoluisset,':
       [6915]1
     * Gloriose admodum exaltatum est: [6916]1
     * Graves poenæ, quæ possunt cæteris documento esse, exempla dicuntur:
       [6917]1
     * Grotius, in lib. v. De Veritat. Relig. Christian. in notis R. Sel.
       Aben Ezra et Onkelos adducit. Sed alienis oculis hic vidit, aut
       aliena fide retulit (forte authoribus illis aut non intellectis,
       aut propter occupationes non inspectis), aut animositati et
       authoritati in citandis authoribus, et referendis dictis aut factis
       ipsi hoc usui veniebat, nimium in scriptis theologicis indulserit.:
       [6918]1
     * Hæc autem Filii : [6919]1
     * Hæc de ea sapientia quæ in Lege apparet exponunt Hebræi: et sane
       el, si non soli, at præcipue, hæc attributa conveniunt: [6920]1
     * Hæc signa edebat Jesus, per Spiritum illum sanctitas: [6921]1
     * Hæc testimonia agunt de peccato voluntario; ex iis itaque effici
       nequit peccatum originis. Quod autem ad primum attinet, Moses id
       peccatum ejusmodi fuisse docet cujus causa poenituisse Deum quod
       hominem creasset, et eum diluvio punire decrevisset; quod certe de
       peccato quod homini natura inesset, quale peccatum originis
       censeat, affirmari nullo pacto potest. In altero vero testimonio
       docet, peccatum homi-nis eam vim habiturum non esse, ut Deus mundum
       diluvio propter illud puniret; quod etiam peccato originis nullo
       modo convenit.: [6922]1
     * Hæreo lac inter meditans, interque cruorem;: [6923]1
     * Habemus in Francia novum de vetere magtheologum, qui ab ineunte
       ætate sua in arte dialectica lusit, et nunc in Scripturis sanctis
       insanit: [6924]1
     * Habemus in Francia novum de veteri magistro theologum, qui ab

     * Haud ignota loquor: [6926]1
     * Hebræis et Chaldæis etiam propter: [6927]1
     * Hic primum adorationem cum invocatione confundis, quod tamen fieri
       non debet, cum utriusque sit diversa quædam ratio, adeo ut ego,
       quamvis nihil prorsus dubitem, præceptum extare de adorando
       Christo, et etiamsi non extaret, tamen eum a nobis adorari omnino
       debere, non idem tamen existimem de eodem invocando, cum videlicet
       invocatio pro ipsa opis imploratione, et directione precum
       nostrarum accipitur. Hic enim statuo id quidem merito a nobis fieri
       posse, id est, posse nos jure ad ipsum Christum preces nostras
       dirigere, nihil tamen esse quod nos id facere cogat.: [6928]1
     * Hic primum ea vox in narratione Evangelica reperitur ab Apostolis
       Jesu tributa, postquam scilicet sua resurrectione probaverat, se
       esse a quo vita et quidem æterna exspectari deberet, Vide supra,
       xi. 25. Mansit deinde ille mos in ecclesia, ut apparet non tantum
       in scriptis Apostolicis ut: [6929]1
     * Hic verbum, omnia: [6930]1
     * Hieronymus de Seriptoribus Ecclesiasticis de Johanne: [6931]1
     * Hinc colligitur solam Christi mortem, nequaquam illam perfectam
       absolutamque ipsius oblationem de qua in Epist. ad Hebræos agitur,
       fuisse; sed principium et præparationem quandam istius sacerdotii
       in coelo demum administrandi, extitisse.: [6932]1
     * Hinc illæ lacrimæ: [6933]1
     * Hoc idem dici potest de eo, quod imago Dei inconspicui vocatur.:
       [6934]1
     * Hoc illis negotium est, non ethnicos convertendi, sed nostros
       evertendi.: [6935]1
     * Hoc mysterium nobis a Deo per sacras literas revelatum esse
       plurimum gaudemus: [6936]1
     * Hoc passionis tempore,: [6937]1
     * Hoc sane vel hinc patere potest, quod essentia Dei sit una numero;
       quapropter plures numero personæ, in ea esse nullo pacto possunt.
       Quænam est hæc una Persona divina? Est ille Deus unus, Domini
       nostri Jesu Christi Pater: [6938]1
     * Hoc sequetur, quod ipsius etiam Christi imago sit adoranda, quia
       una et eadem adoratio respicit in imaginem, tanquam medium, in
       Christum tanquam finem, quemadmodum Thomas Aquinas docet, a quo
       tuum tu commentum es mutuatus.: [6939]1
     * Hoc tantum dicam, cum nuper Bellarmini disputationum primum tomum
       evolverem, supra modum me miratum fuisse, quod ad finem fere
       singularum controversiarum homo alioqui acutus ac sagax ea verba
       aut curaverit aut permiserut adscrubu; Laus Deo, virginique matri;
       quibus verbis manifeste Virfini Mariæ divinus cultus, aut ex sequo
       cum ipso Deo, aut certe secundum Deum exhibetur.: [6940]1
     * Homo Deificatus: [6941]1
     * Homo deificatus: [6942]1
     * Homo ille Jes. Nazarenus qui Christus appellatur, non per spiritum
       propheticum, sed per Spiritum Sanctum locutus est; id est, quamvis
       a Deo legatus fuerit, non tamen quæcunque verba ex ipsius Dei ore
       provenisse censenda sunt. 2. Hinc fit ut illius et apostolorum ejus
       verba, ad Mosaicæ legis et aliorum propheticorum oraculorum normam
       expendenda sint, et siquid contrarium vel diversum ab his in illis
       reperitur, aut reperiri videtur, id aut rejiciendum, aut certe ita
       in terpretandum sit, ut cum Mosis et prophetarum doctrina
       consentiat quæ sola morum et divini cultus regula est.: [6943]1
     * Huc accedit, quod Racovienses isti, sive coetus Racoviensis, quem
       tu petis atque oppugnas, vel non amplius extat, vel ita hodie
       mutatus est, et in aliam quodammodo formam versus, ut agnosci non
       queat.: [6944]1
     * Huic pretium nullum solvito: [6945]1
     * Id argamentum firmum non esse hinc patet; Primum, quod Solomon agat
       de sapientia simpliciter et absolute considerata, sine additione
       vocis Dei; Paulus vero non simpliciter et absolute, sed cum
       additione, nempe, Dei. Deinde, Solomon agit de sapientia, quæ neque
       est persona, nec esse potest, ut evariis effectis quæ huic
       sapientiæ attribuit, apparet, et hoc: [6946]1
     * Id est, Id agit ut vos Hebroæos liberet a peccatis et metu mortis.
       Eventûs enim nomen sæpe datur operæ in id impensæ: [6947]1
     * Id est, durabit per annos 29: [6948]1
     * Id est, erit: [6949]1
     * Id est, in magna mundi parte: [6950]1
     * Id est, nascetur: [6951]1
     * Id quidem est ut cognoscamus in essentia Dei unam tantum personam
       esse. Demonstra hoc ipsum.: [6952]1
     * Idem ibid.: [6953]1
     * Ideo autem nusquam Scriptum est, quod Deus Pater major sit Spiritu
       Sancto, vel Spiritus Sanctus minor Deo Patre; quia non sic assumpta
       est creatura in qua appareret S. S. sicut assumptus est filius
       hominis, in qua forma ipsius Verbi Dei persona præentaretur.:
       [6954]1
     * Illic solidum triennium quod excurrit theologiæ studio incubuit,
       paucissimis Lælii patrui scriptis et pluribus ab iis relictis notis
       multum adjutus est.: [6955]1
     * Illud certissimum est, Gregorium Zarnovecium, ministrum ut vocant
       evangelicum qui nominatim adversus disputationem meam de Jesu
       Christo Salvatore libellum Polonice edidit, in ejus præfatione
       asserere, me ex Ochini Dialogis annis abhinc circiter triquinta
       qumque editis sententiam illius meæ disputationis accepisse, nam
       certe, in Dialogis ms, quorum non pauca exempla jamdiu in ipsa
       Polonia mihi videre contigit: [6956]1
     * Illud corpus ante peccatum, et mortale secundum aliam, et immortale
       secundum aliam causam dici poterat; id est, mortale quia poterat
       mori, immortale quia poterat non mori. Aliud est enim non posse
       mori, sicut quasdam naturas immortales creavit Deus, aliud est
       autem posse non mori; secundum quem modum primus creatus est homo
       immortalis, quod ei præstabatur de ligno vitæ, non de constitutione
       naturæ; a quo ligno separatus est cum peccasset, ut posset mori,
       qui nisi peccasset posset non mori. Mortalis ergo erat conditione
       corporis animalls, immortalis autem beneficio conditoris. Si enim
       corpus animale, utique et mortale, quia et mori poterat, quamvis et
       immortale dico, quia et mori non poterat.: [6957]1
     * Illud vero notandum, quod procurantibus Georgio Blandrata et Fausto
       Socino, in Transylvania exulibus, Franciscus David morti traditus
       fuit.: [6958]1
     * Immo, quia non sunt, cum fuerint, eos miseros esse.: [6959]1
     * Imo consultator Dei fortis: [6960]1
     * Imo plusquam hæreticum eum (ecclesiæ nostræ) judicaverunt, nam
       talem hominem indignum Christiano nomme esse dixerunt; quippe qui
       Christo invocationis cultum prorsus detrahendo, et eum curam
       ecclesiæ gerere negando, simul reipsa negaret eum ease Christum.:
       [6961]1
     * Impius, ne audeto placare iram deorum: [6962]1
     * In Adamo: [6963]1
     * In Christo, Deus ut ostenderet se veracem et fidelem esse, quod
       significant verba ilia, justitiæ suæ: [6964]1
     * In Deo simplex est intuitus, quo simpliciter videntur quæ composita
       sunt, invariabiliter quæ variabilia sunt, et simul quæ successiva.:
       [6965]1
     * In Hebræo est vocabit: [6966]1
     * In Hebræo non est futuri. Pater seculi est: [6967]1
     * In eo ne similitudinem quidem incarnationis (ut vocant) apparere,
       cum is scriptor non dicat, Christum assumpisse: [6968]1
     * In eosdem exercuoit stylum ut Ravenspergerus.: [6969]1
     * In has angustias Cicero coarctat animum religiosum, ut unum eligat
       e duobus, -- aut ease aliquid in nostra voluntate, aut esse
       præscientiam futurorum: quoniam utrumque arbitratur esse non posse,
       sed ai alterum confirmatur, alterum tolli: si elegerimus
       præscientiam futurorum, tolli voluntatis arbitrium: si elegerimus
       voluntatis arbitrium, tolli præscientiam futurorum. Ipse itaque ut
       vir magnus et doctus, et vitæ humanæ plurimum et peritissime
       consulens, ex his duobus elegit liberum voluntatis arbitrium. Quod
       ut confirmaretur, negavit præscientiam futurorum, atque ita dum
       vult facere liberos, facit sacrilegos. Religiosus autem animus
       utrumque eligit, utrumque confitetur, et fide pietatis utrumque
       confirmat. Quomodo inquit: Nam si est præscientia futurorum,
       sequuntur illa omnia, quæ connexa sunt, donec eo perveniatur, ut
       nihil sit in nostra voluntate, Porro, si est aliquid in nostra
       voluntate, eisdem recursis gradibus eo pervenitur, ut non sit
       præscientia futurorum. Nam per illa omnia sic recurritur. Si est
       voluntatis arbitrium, non onmia fato fiunt. Si non omnia fato
       fiunt, non est omnium certus ordo causarum. Si certus causarum ordo
       non est: nec rerum certus est ordo præscienti Deo, quæ fieri non
       possunt nisi præcedentibus, et efficientibus causis. Si rerum ordo
       præscienti Deo certus non est, non omuia sic veniunt, ut ea ventura
       præscivit. Porro, si non omnia sic eveniunt ut ab illo eventura
       præscita sunt, non est, inquit in Deo præscientia futurorum. Nos
       adversus istos sacrilegos ausus, et impios, et Deum dicimus omnia
       scire antequam fiant; et voluntate nos facere, quicquidnobis non
       nisi volentibus fieri sentimus et novimus.: [6970]1
     * In hoc loco non solum non exprinfitur præ-æternitas Christi, cum
       aliud sit, ante Abrahamum fuisse, aliud, præ-æternum; verum ne hoc
       quidem expressum est, ipsum ante Mariam Virginem fuisse. Et enim ea
       verba aliter legi posse (nimirum hac ratione, Amen, amen, dico
       vobis, Priusquam Abraham fiat, ego sum: [6971]1
     * In morte utrumque munus (mediatoris, et sacerdotis) veluti coit: et
       prius quidem in ea desinit, eaque confirmatur; postremum autem
       incipit, et ad id Christus fuit quodammodo præparatus.: [6972]1
     * In quibus scripturis Christus vocatur Deus?: [6973]1
     * In scientia sua: [6974]1
     * In scientia sua.: [6975]1
     * In tertio testimonio, cum agatur de eo qui Agnus est, et qui
       vestimenta ha Revelation bet quem et occisum, et sanguine suo nos
       redimisse, apertissime idem Johannes fatetur, quæ referri ad
       divinam naturam nulla ratione poassunt, apparet eo naturam divinam
       Christi astrui non posse. Omnia veto quæ hic Christo in iis
       testimoniis tribuuntur, singularem ipsius potestatem quam Deus
       Christo in iis quæ ad novum foedus pertinent, dedit, arguunt.:

       dicamus, duos tantum nominabimus, quorum alter ante annos mille
       ducentos, alter vero nostra ærate vixit. Ille Photinus fuit quondam
       Sirmii episcopus, ipsorum etiam adversariorum testimonio divinarum
       literarum doctissimus: [6979]1

       [6981]1
     * Inter ambos ipsos: [6982]1
     * Inter delicias uberis et lateris.: [6983]1
     * Interventus sanguinis Christi, licet Deum ad liberationem hanc a
       peccatorum nostrorum poena nobis concedendum movere non potuerit,
       movit tamen nos ad eam nobis oblatam accipiendam, et Christo fidem
       habendam.: [6984]1
     * Ipse autem vulneratus est propter iniquitates nostras.: [6985]1

     * Ista sapientia rerum divinarum, et sanctimonia, quam Adamo ante
       lapsum tribuit Franzius, una cum aliis, idea quædam est, in cerebro
       ipsorum nata.: [6991]1
     * Ita argumentor, quoties regnum Davidi usque in seculum promissum
       est tale necesse fuit, ut posteri ejus, in quibus hæc promissio
       impleri debebat, haberent: sed regnum mundanum Davidi usque in
       seculum promissum est, ergo regnum mundanum posteri Davidis ut
       haberent necesse est: et per consequens, rex file, quem prophetæ ex
       hac promissione post captivitatem Babylonicam regnaturum
       promiserunt, perinde ut cæteri posteri Davidis, mundanum regnum
       debuit habere. Quod quia Jesus ille non habuit (non enim regnavit
       ut David et posteri ejus), sed dicitur habere coeleste regnum, quod
       est diversum a mundano regno; ergo Jesus ille non est rex quem
       prophetæ promiserunt.: [6992]1
     * Ita asperget gentes multas.: [6993]1
     * Ita foede me percutiat magnus Jupiter, ut foede hunt porcum macto,

     * Ita jocaris, quasi ego dicam, eos esse miseros, qui nati non sunt,
       et non eos miseros, qui mortui sunt.: [6995]1
     * Ita plane.: [6996]1
     * Itaque inconsiderate illi faciunt, qui futura contingentia Deum
       determinate scire aiunt, quia alias non esset omniscius: cum
       potius, ideo illa determinate futura non concipiat, quia est
       omniscius.: [6997]1

     * Jam vero satis apparet, Christum priori modo spectatum, penitus Deo
       subordinatum esse.: [7000]1
     * Jam vero sciendum est: multo quidem citius, quam nunc demure

     * Lapsus Adami, cum unus actus fuerit, vim eam, quæ depravare ipsam

       potuit. Ipsi veto in pænam irrogatum fuisse, nec Scriptura docet,
       ut superius exposuimus, et Deum ilium, qui omnis sequitatis fons
       est, incredibile prorsus est id facere voluisse.: [7016]1

       Davidis, ubi Christi Domini invocationem honoremque nomini ejus
       sacrosancto convenientem asseris, ac contra calumnias Francisci
       Davidis defendis. Attamen videris mihi, paucis verbis, optimam
       sententiam non tantum obscurasse, sed quasi in dubium revocasse,
       adversariosque in errore confirmasse. Quæris quid sit quod tantum
       malum secum importare possit? Breviter respondeo, verba ilia quæ
       sæpius addis, Christum Dominum invocaro posaumus, sed non debemus,

     * Me imitari noli, qui nescio quo malo genio ductore, cum jam divinæ
       veritatis fontes degustassem, ita sum abreptus, ut majorem et
       potiorem juventutis meæ partem, inanibus quibusdam aliis studiis,
       imo inertiæ atque otio dederim, quod cum mecum ipse reputo, reputo
       autem sæpissime, tanto dolore afficior, ut me vivere quodam modo

     * Mea omnia tua sunt, et tua mea: [7024]1
     * Memini te mihi hujus rei solutioonem cum esses Racoviæ afffeerre,

     * Merito dictum est a veteribus, potius in hac vita de Deo a nobis
       cognosci quid non sit, quam quid sit; ut enim cognoscamus quid Deus
       non sit, negatione nimirum aliqua, quæ propria sit divinæ essentiæ,
       satis est unica negatio dependentiæ: [7028]1
     * Messias prosperabitur, vocabulum est quod quatuor mundos

     * Modò secunda, modò tertiâ personâ, de Jeremia loquitur, quod

       foedè tractari, detrudi in carcerem, deinde in lacum lutosum,
       ibique et pædore et cibi inopiâ contabescere; sic contra, rebus
       mutatis, admirationi erit honos ipsi habitus: [7030]1
     * Monendum lectorem harum rerum ignarum censui, Blandratam haud
       paulum ante mortem suam vivente adhuc Stephano rege Poloniæ, in
       illius gratiam, et quo illum erga se liberaliorem (ut fecit)
       redderet, plurimum remisisse de studio suo in ecclesiis nostris
       Transilvanicis nostrisque hominibus juvandis: imo eo tandem
       devenisse ut vix existimaretur priorem quam tantopere foverat de
       Deo et Christo sententiam retinere, sed potius Jesuitis, qui in ea
       provincia tunc temporis Stephani regis, et ejus fratris
       Christopheri haud multo ante vitam functi, ope ac liberalitate non
       mediocriter, fiorebant, jam adhærere aut certe cum eis quodammodo
       colludere Illud certissimum est, cum ab eo tempore quo
       liberalitatem quam ambiebat regis Stephani erga se est expertus,
       coepisse quosdam ex nostris hominibus quos charissimos prius
       habebat, et suis opibus juvabat spernere ac deserere, etiam contra
       promissa et obligationem suam, et tandem illos penitus deseruisse,
       atque omni veræ et sinceræ pietatis studio valedixisse, et solis
       pecuniis congerendis intentum fuisse, quæ fortasse justissimo Dei
       judicio, quod gravissimum exercere solet contra tales desertores,
       ei necem ab eo quem suum heredem fecerat conciliarunt.: [7031]1
     * More patrio decimari voluerunt.: [7032]1
     * Mox agunt de imaginibus sanctissimæ Trinitatis, non contenti
       simpliciorum quorundam picturas convellere, eas item quæ ab
       Ecclesia Catholica rite usurpatæ sunt, scommatibus et blasphemis
       carminibus proscindunt.: [7033]1
     * Multa passim ab ultima vetustate vitia admissa sunt, quæ nemo

     * Multum illa tempestate turbarum dederat Transylvanicis ecclesiis
       Francisi Davidis et reliquorum de honore ac potestate Christi
       opinio; cui malo remedium quærens Georgius Blandrata Socinum Basilæ
       evocavit (anno 1578), ut præcipuum factionis ducem Franciscum
       Davidem, a tam turpi et pernicioso errore abstraheret.: [7036]1
     * Munus igitur sacerdotale in eo situm est, quod quemadmodum pro
       regio munere potest nobis in omnibus nostris necessitatibus
       subvenire, ita pro munere sacerdotali subvenire vult, ac porro
       subvenit; atque hæc illius subveniendi, seu opis afferendæ ratio,
       sacrificium ejus appellatur.: [7037]1
     * Nam annos abhinc sex atque eo amplius idem paradoxum in mea de Jesu
       Christo Servatore disputatione sine dubio legisti.: [7038]1
     * Nam ego quidem sic statuok etsi non pendent aliuude rerum sacrarum
       veritas quam ab unico Dei verbo, et sedul vitanda est nobis omnis :
       [7039]1
     * Nam mihi dum lachrymas amor elicit ubera sugo: [7040]1
     * Nam quod ais, ea ibi, tum de Christianorum resurrectione, tum de
       morte impiorum pæssim contineri, quæ a multis sine magna
       offensione, tum nostris tum aliis, legi non possint; scio equidem
       ea ibi contineri, sed meo judicio nec passim, nec ita aperte (cavi
       enim istud quantum potui) ut quisquam vir pius facile offendi
       possit, adeo ut quod nominatim attinet ad impiorum mortem, in quo
       dogmate majus est multo offensionis periculum, ea potius ex iis
       colligi possit, quæ ibi disputantur, quam expresse literis
       consignata extet; adeo ut lector, qui alioqui sententiam meam
       adversus Puccium de mortalitate primi hominis, quæ toto libro
       agitatur, quæque ob non paucos quos habet fautores parum aut nihil
       offensionis parere potest, probandam censeat, prius sentiat
       doctrinam istam sibi jam persuasam esse quam suaderi animadvertat.:
       [7041]1
     * Nam quod dicimus, si Deus mundanum regem mundanumque regnum
       promisit, coelestem autem regein, coeleste, regnum reipsa præstitit
       plus eum præstitisse quam promiserit, recte omimino dicimus, nam
       qui plus præstat quam promisit, suis promissis non modo non
       stetisse sed ea etiam cumulate præstitisse est agnoscendus.:
       [7042]1
     * Nam quod mihi objicis me communionem cum fratribus, et Christi
       fidelibus spernere nec cuare ut cum ipsis coenam Domini celebrem,
       respondeo, me postquam in Poloniam veni, nihil antiquius habuisse,
       quam ut me quam maxime fratribus conjungerem, licet invenissem
       illos in non parvis religionis nostræ capitibus, a me diversum
       sentire; quemadmodum multi hodieque sentiunt: quod si nihilominus
       aquas baptismum una cum illis non accipio, hoc præterea fit, quia
       id bona conscientia facere nequeo, nisi publice ante protestor, me
       non quod censeam baptismum aquæ mihi meique similibus ullo modo
       necessarium esse: [7043]1
     * Nam rex Seleucus me opere oravit maxumo,: [7044]1
     * Nam si omnia futura, qualiacunque sunt, Deo ab omni æternitate
       determinate cognita fuisse contendas; necesse est statuere omnia
       necessario fieri, ac futura esse Unde sequitur, nullam esse, aut
       fuisse unquam, humanæ voluntatis libertatem, ac porro nec
       religionem.: [7045]1
     * Nate cruore, sitim comprime lacte parens.: [7046]1
     * Naturale jus talionis hic indicatur.: [7047]1
     * Natus ex Bethlehemo: [7048]1
     * Ne hic quidem de incarnatione (ut vocant) ullam mentionem factam,
       cum is mundus, in quem ingressum Jesum is autor ait, sit ille
       mundus futuras, ut superius demonstratum eat; unde etiam ingredi in
       illum mundum, non nasci in mundum, sed in coelum ingredi
       significat. Deinde, illis verbis, Corpus aptasti mihi: [7049]1
     * Ne scutica dignum horribili sectere flagello.: [7050]1
     * Nec dari quicquam necesse est, ut substantiam capiat obligatio; sed
       sufficit eos qui negotia gerunt consentire.: [7051]1
     * Nec dubito, hinc Johannem augustum illud et magnificum Evangelii
       sui initium sumpsisse, In principio erat Verbum;' nam Verbum et
       Sapientia idem sunt, et secundam Trinitatis personam indicant:
       [7052]1
     * Nec enim omni tempore quo Christus Filius Dei fuit, Deus etiam
       fuit. Filium enim Dei esse, ad nativitatem etiam referri, et ob
       ortum ipsum aliquem Dei Filium appelari posse nemo non intelligit.
       At Deum (præter unum illum Deum) nemo esse potest, nisi propter
       similtudinem cum Deo. Itaque tunc cum Christus Deo similis factus
       esset per divinas quæ in ipso erant qualitates, summo jure eatenus
       Dei Filius, qua Deus, et vicissim eatenus Deus, qua Dei Filius. At
       ante obtentam illam cum Deo similitudinem Deus proprie dici non
       potuit.: [7053]1
     * Nec enim prius D. Jesus Rex reipsa factus est, quam cum consedit ad
       dextram Dei patris, et regnare reipsa in coelo, et in terra
       coepit.: [7054]1
     * Nec illis denique verbia, quod plenitudo divinitatis in eo habitat
       corporaliter: [7055]1
     * Nec vincet ratio hoc, tantundem ut peccet idemque,: [7056]1
     * Necessarium est hoc tristi tempore, quo Sociniana pestis, quam haud
       immerito dixeris omnis impietatis : [7057]1
     * Necessitas magna fuit, ut Christus ab initio vitæ suæ esset Deo
       Filius, qualis futurus non fuisset nisi Dei virtute aliquid creatum
       fuisset, quod ad constituendum Christi corpus, una cum Mariæ
       sanguine concurrit. Mansit autem nihilominus sanguis Mariæ Virginis
       purissimus, etiamsi cum alio aliquo semine commixtus fuit. Potuit
       enim tam purum, imo porius semen, a Deo creari, et proculdubio
       creatum fuit, quam erat sanguis Mariæ. Communis denique sensus et
       fides Christianorum omnium, quod Christus non ex virili semine
       conceptus sit; primum communis error censendus est, si sacris
       literis repuguet: Deinde id quod omnes sentiunt, facile cum ipsa
       veritate conciliari potest, ut : [7058]1
     * Nego consequentiam: Deus dicere potuit se scire quid facturus erat
       Abraham, etsi id certo non prænoverit, sed probabiliter. Inducitur
       enim Deus sæpius humano more loquens. Solent autem homines
       affirmare se scire ea futura, quæ verisimiliter futura sunt:
       [7059]1
     * Nemo prudens punit quia peccatum est, sed ne peccetur: revocari
       enim præterita non possunt, futura prohibeantur: [7060]1
     * Nempe cum admiratione maxima. Angeli hoc arcanum per homines
       mortales didicere: [7061]1
     * Neque enim vel ipsum ingessit, vel a nobis missus est ad foedus
       inter Deum, et nos peragendum: sed Dei, qui ipsum in hunc finem
       miserat, minister, ac internuntius hac in parte fuit.: [7062]1
     * Neque porro quemquam ease arbitror, qui in tot ac tantis Christianæ
       religionis placitis, a reliquis homimbus dissentiat, in quot
       quantisque ego dissentio.: [7063]1
     * Neque vero hoc juramentum pro tuenda pace evangelica præstitisset,
       nisi eum Johannes Shirli palatinus Cracoviensis, vir plenus zeli et
       magnæ cum potentia authoritatis, adegisset; fertur enim cum rex
       Henricus jam coronandus esset nec pacem inter dissidentes se
       conservaturum jurasset, sed silentio eludere vellet, accepta quæ
       regi tum præferebatur corona exittun ex templo parasse, et in hæc
       prorupisse verba, Si non jurabis, non regnabis': [7064]1
     * Nihil illis divitiæ suæ profuerunt, quibus redimi se posse
       speraverant. Eo quod iniquitatem non fecerit, neque : [7065]1
     * Nihil in hac liberatione desideratur, ut omnino veræ redemptioni
       respondeat, nisi ut is qui captivum detinebat pretium accipiat.
       Quamvis autem quibusdam videatur dici posse diabolum, pretium quod
       in nostra liberatione intervenit, accepisse, quemadmodum
       antiquiores theologi, inter quos Ambrosius et Augustinus, ausi sunt
       dicere, tamen id perabsurdum videri debet, et recte est neminem id
       pretium accepisse affirmare. Ea siquidem ratione potissimum, non
       vera sed metaphorica redemptio, liberatio nostra est, quocirca in
       ea nemo est qui pretium accipiat; si enim id quod in ipso pretii
       loco est acceptum (ab eo scilicet qui captivum hominem detinebat)
       fuisset, jam non metaphoricum sed verum pretium intervenisset, et
       propterea vera redemptio esset.: [7066]1
     * Nimis longe a propria verborum signiticatione recedendum est, et
       sententiarum vis enervanda, si eas cum definita ilia futurorum
       contingentium præscientia conciliare velis, ut : [7067]1
     * Nisi Scriptura dixisset, non licuisset dicere, sed ex quo scriptum
       est dici potent.: [7068]1
     * Nobilior reliquis si tibi sanguis inest.: [7069]1
     * Noli minitari scio crucem: [7070]1
     * Nomen unigeniti Filii Dei: [7071]1
     * Non autem ut fuerunt quidam: [7072]1
     * Non dicis igitur, miser est M. Crassus, seal tautum, miser M.
       Crassus.: [7073]1
     * Non est etiam aliqua alia morris Christi causa? -- Nulla prorsus.
       Etsi nuno vulgo Christiani sentiunt, Christum morte sua nobis
       salutem meruisse, et pro peccatis nostris plenarie satisfecisse,
       quæ sententia fallax est et erronea, et admodum peraiciosa.:
       [7074]1
     * Non est fortasse eorum verborum ea sententia, quam plerique omnes
       arbitrantur: Deum scilicet esse spiritum, neque enim subaudiendum
       esse dicit aliquis verbum : [7075]1
     * Non habetur eo loco, In Adamo omnes peccasse: [7076]1
     * Non incredibile est: [7077]1
     * Non movit modo talis oratio regem, sed etiam reconciliavit
       Annibali: [7078]1
     * Non possem antidote nobiliore frui.: [7079]1
     * Non simpliciter usuram damnant: modo æquitatis et charitatis regula
       non violetur.: [7080]1
     * Non ut Deus esset habitator, natura humana esset habitaculum: sed
       ut naturæ alteri sic misceretur altera, ut quamvis alia sit quæ
       suscipitur, alia vero quæ suscipit, in tantam tamen unitatem
       conveniret utriusque diversitas, ut unus idemque sit Filius, qui
       se, et secundum quod unus homo est, Patre dicit minorem, et
       secundum quod unus Deus est, Patri se profitetur æqualem.: [7081]1
     * Nonne ad credendum Evangelio S. S. interiore dono opus est? --
       Nullo modo; non enim iu Scripturis legimus, cuiquam id conferri
       donum, nisi credenti evangelio.: [7082]1
     * Nonne peccato originis hoc liberum arbitrium vitiatum est? --
       Peccatum originis nullum prorsus est: quare nec liberum arbitrium
       vitiare potuit, nec enim e Scriptura id peccatum originis doceri
       potest; et lapsus Adæ cum unus actus fuerit, vim eam quæ depravare
       ipsam naturam Adami, multo minus vero posterorum ipsius posset,
       habere non potuit. Ipsi vero in poenam irrogatum fuisse, nec
       Scriptura docet, uti superius exposuimus; et Deum ilium, qui omnis
       æquitatis fons est, incredibile prorsus est, id facere voluisse.:
       [7083]1
     * Nos Dei virtutem in Virginis uterum aliquam substantiam creatam vel
       immisisse, aut ibi creasse affirmamus, ex qua juncto eo, quod ex
       ipsius Virginis substantia accessit, verus homo generatus fuit.
       Alias enim homo ille, Dei Filius a conceptione et nativitate
       proprie non fuisset: [7084]1
     * Nos facimus, Fortuna, Deam.: [7085]1
     * Nos paulo ante ostendimus divinum cultum, qui Christo debetur, et
       directe ipsum Christum respicit, non esse illum qui uni illi soli
       Deo convenit.: [7086]1
     * Nos quidem o amici haud difficulter poterimus vobiscum earn rem
       transigere, nam ubi primum Biblia aperueritis, et initium veteris
       et novæ legis consideraveritis, statim offendetis, id ibi asseri
       quod vos pernegatis, sic enim Geneseos primo Scriptura loquitur,
       Faciamus hominem ad imaginem nostram.: [7087]1
     * Nos tanquam piacula mundi facti sumus, et succedaneæ pro populo
       victimæ: [7088]1
     * Nos tentabis Dominum Deum tuum, quemadmodum tentasti in loco
       tentationis: [7089]1
     * Nos vero hic non dicimus Amen, neque enim nos novimus Deum istum
       Trinitatem.: [7090]1
     * Nota quod in locis innumeris in Talmud hoc expenitur de Messia, et
       nunquam de alio, ab aliquo qui alicujus apud Hebræos authoritatis
       sit. Quare pater quod errant, nimium judaizantes nostri, qui hoc de
       Josia ad literam non verentur expenere. De solo quippe Messia hoc
       intelligendum fore ostenditur per R. Solomon, qui hoc de ipso non
       de Josia exponit; quod juxta morem suum nunquam, egisset, si absque
       injuria sui Talmud et Targum, et sine prædecessorum suorum omnium
       præjudicio, aliter exponere potuisset.: [7091]1
     * Notatu vero dignissimum est hisce novis Arianis ad apostasiam seu
       Arianismum occasionem fuisse, doctrinam Calvinistarum, id quod ipsi
       Ariani haud obscure professi sunt. Recitabo hujus rei exemplum
       memorabile de Adamo Neusero ante paucos annos Ecclesiæ
       Heidelbergensis ad S. S. primario pastore nobilissimo
       sacramentario. Hic ex Zvinglianisimo per Ariauismum ad Mahometismum
       usque, cum aliis non paucis Calvinistis Constantinopolin
       circumcisionem judaicam recipiens et veritatem agnitam abnegans
       progressus est Hic Adamus sequentia verba dedit Constantinopol. D.
       Gerlachio, anne 1574, nullus nostro tempore mihi notus factus est
       Arianus qui non antea fuerit Calvinista. Servetus, etc., igitur qui
       sibi timet ne incidat in Arianismum, caveat Calvinismum.'?: [7092]1
     * Notemus igitur Christum Judæos tanquam in verborum suorum
       intelligentia hallucinatos minime reprehendentem se naturalem Dei
       Filium clare professum ease. Deinde, quod isto modo colligunt
       Christum se Deo æqualem facere recte fecerunt; nec ideo a Christo
       refelluntur, aut vituperantur ab evangelista, qui in re tanta nos
       errare non fuerit passus.: [7093]1
     * Novi isti Ariani exorti sunt in Polonia, Lithuania, et ipsa nimirum
       Transylvania, ac eorum caput et ducem se profitetur Gregorius Pauli
       minister ecclesiæ Racoviensis, homo impius, ambitiosus et in
       blasphemis effutiendis plane effrænis; et ita quidem jactabundus ut
       adscribere sibi, cum aliis Arianis, non vereatur excisionem
       antichristi: ejusdem extirpationem ab imis fundamentis: Lutherum
       enim vix minimam partem revelationis antichristi reliquisse.:

     * Novum Testamentum divinitus oblatum aperio. Aliud agenti exhibet se
       mihi aspectu primo augustissimum illud caput Johannis evangelistæ

     * Nulla jam alia propositione nobis opus est, cum hæc se obtulerit;
       nos autem, Deo volente, et volumus, et parati sumus demonstrate,
       quod Spiritus Sanctus non allure nos Deum in Sciptura doceat, nisi

     * Oblatus est quia ipse voluit: [7110]1
     * Oblatus est quia ipse voluit, et non aperuit os suum.: [7111]1
     * Omne datum bonum et donum perfectum desursum est, descendens a
       Patre luminum: [7112]1
     * Omne peccatum est adeo voluntarium, ut si non sit voluntarium non
       est peccatum: [7113]1
     * Omnis poena, si justa est, peccati poena est: [7114]1
     * Oppressus estet ipse affiictus est: [7115]1
     * Origo ipsi ab olim, a temporibus longis: [7116]1
     * Ostenditur ergo Jesus nobilis ex materna parte, utpete ex Rege
       terreno ortus; sed nobilior ex Paterna parte, quippe a Deo factus
       rex coelestis post resurrectionem: [7117]1
     * Poenitentia infert ignorantiam præteriti, presentis, et futuri,
       mutationem voluntatis, et errorem in consiliis, quorum nihil in
       Deum cadere potest: dicitur tamen ille metaphorice poenitentia
       duci, quemadmodum nos, quando alicujus rei poenitet, abolemus id
       quod antea feceramus: quod fieri potest sine tali mutatione
       voluntatis, qua nunc homo aliquid facit, quod post mutate animo,
       destruit.: [7118]1
     * Poenitentia, cum mutabilitatem importet, non potest esse in Deo,
       dicitur tamen poenitere, eo quod ad modum poenitentis se habet,
       quando destruit quod fecerat.: [7119]1
     * Poenitet fecisse me hominem: [7120]1
     * Palæologus præcipuus fuit ex Antesignanis illorum qui Christum nec
       invocandum, nec adorandum esse hodie affirmant et interim tamen se
       Christianos esse impudenter profitentur, quo vix quidquam
       scelestius in religione nostra depravanda excogitari posse
       existimo.: [7121]1
     * Partes hujus muneris hæc sunt potissimum; mactatio victimæ, in
       tabernaculum ad oblationem peragendam ingressio, et ex eodem
       egressio. Ac mactatio quidem mortem Christi violentam, sanguinisque
       profusionem continet.: [7122]1
     * Pater futuri seculi: [7123]1
     * Pater noster: [7124]1
     * Pater sancte, serve illos in nomine tuo, ut sint unum, quemadmodum
       et nos unum sumus: [7125]1
     * Pater, avus, proavus, abavus.: [7126]1
     * Peccatum originis nullum prorsus est, quare nec liberum arbitrium
       vitiare potuit. Nec enim e Scriptura id peccatum originis doceri
       potest.: [7127]1
     * Per plurima miracula approbata est ea veritas.: [7128]1
     * Perlecto scripto tuo contra Volanum animadverti argumenta ejus
       satis accurate a te refutata, locaque scripturæ pleraque examinata,
       ac elucidata, verum no sine mærore (ne quid gravius addam) incidi
       inter legendum in quoddam paradoxon, Scripturæ sacræ contrarium ac
       plane horrendum, dum Christum in morte sua sive in cruce,
       sacrificium obtulisse pernegas, miror quid tibi in mentem venerit,
       ut tam confidenter (ne quid aliud dicam) contra manifesta sacræ
       Scripturæ testimonia pugnare, contrariamque sententiam tueri non
       timeas.: [7129]1

       perhibetur D. Simeon, concionatorum princeps, qui Francofurti olim
       degebat. Hic e Judæorum vetustissimis scriptis, secundum bibliorum
       seriem, dicta et explicationes plurimas: magna diligentia et labore
       collegit: unde libri suo nomen: [7140]1
     * Porro significatio ilia, precari, in loco nostro locum habere non
       potest; alioqui sequeretur Esaiam voluisse dicere, Deum fecisse, ut
       omnium nostrum iniquitas per Christum, vel pro Christo precata
       fuerit, quod longe absurdissimum esse nemo non videt: [7141]1
     * Porto sit Franzius, Paulum mox e vestigio imaginem Dei, seu novum
       hominem its explicare, quod fuerit conditus primus homo ad
       justitiam es sanctimoniam veram. Hic cum erroribus fallaciæ, etiam
       et fortassis voluntariæ, sunt commixtæ Videat lector benevolus
       quanti sit facienda illatio Franzii, dum sit, ergo imago Dei in
       homine ante lapsum consistebat in concreata justitia et vera
       sanctimonia primorum parentum. Si hæc non sunt scopæ dissolutæ,
       equidem nescio quid eas tandem nominabimur.: [7142]1

     * Præterea ea verbs, Omnia in coelis et in terra: [7148]1
     * Præterea, habes locum: [7149]1
     * Præterea, quod est inconveniens si dicatur, Deus Pater venturus
       (prout illi e Vulgata citant) cum Filius ad mundum judicandum
       venerit? An Christus Dei Patris personam in judicio mundi, tanquam
       ejus a quo munus judicandi accepit, non sustinebit?: [7150]1
     * Primum igitur quod attinet ad priorem rationem dico, diversam illam
       lectionem non extare, ut arbitror, neque in ullo probato codice,
       neque apud ullum probatum scriptorem, quod vel ex eo constare
       potest, quod Erasmus in suis Annotatioaibus quamvis de hoc ipso
       loco agat, ejus rei nullam prorsus mentionem facit. Qui Erasmus,
       cure hoc in genere nusquam non diligentissime versatur; tum in
       omnibus locis in quibus Christus Deus appellari videtur, adeo
       diligenter omnia verba expendit, atque examinat, ut non immerito et
       Trinitariis Arianismi suspectus fuerit, et ab Antitrinitariis inter
       eos relatus, qui subobscure Trinitati reclamaverint.: [7151]1
     * Primum, ea verba ad Christum non necessario referri hinc apparet,
       quod de Deo Patre accipi possint; etenim verba paulo superiors de
       eodem dicuntur, excæcavit, induravit, sanavit: [7152]1
     * Primus homo ante lapsum natura mortalis fuit: [7153]1
     * Primus modus est quis quatenus homo ex Spiritu Dei Sancto conceptus
       est, et ex virgine natus est. Nec dubium mihi est, quin ob hunc
       modum, Deus etiam: [7154]1
     * Primus omnium rerum desoriptionem et modum, mentis infinitæ vi et
       ratione designari, et confici voluit: [7155]1
     * Princeps Pacis: [7156]1
     * Princeps pacificus, et in pace victurus: [7157]1
     * Principio cælum: [7158]1
     * Prior pars thesis Franzii falsa est. Nam nullum individuum unquam
       peccato originis fuit infectum. Quia peccatum illud mera est
       fabula, quam tanquam foetum alienum fovent Lutherani, et alii.:
       [7159]1
     * Priusquam Abraham fiat, ego sum: [7160]1
     * Pro eo quod tradidit in mortem animam suam.: [7161]1
     * Prodiit hoc anno in Anglia, authore Johanne Bidello, artium
       magistro, pneumatomacho, duplex Catechesis Scripturaria, Anglico
       idiomate typis evulgata, qua sub nomine religionis Christianæ purum
       putum Socinianismum, orbi Christiano obtrudere satagit. Quanquam
       autem non videatur velle Socinianus haberi; attamen cujus sit
       ingenii, sub finem libelli prodit, cum commendat librum cui
       titulus, : [7162]1
     * Profecto illis temporibus res catholicorum fere deplorata erat; cum
       in amplissimo senatu vix unus aut alter præter episcopos
       reperiebatur.: [7163]1
     * Profecto locus iste magnum scandalum dedit: [7164]1
     * Propheticam et apestolicam doctrinam, quæ veram Dei Patris, Filii,
       et Spiritus Sancti cognitionem continet, amplector ac veneror
       parique religione Deum Pattrem, Filium et Spiritum Sanctum
       distincte secundum sacrarum literarum veritatem colendum,
       implorandumque precibus, libere profiteor. Denique omnem hæreticam
       de Deo Patre, Fitio, et Spiritu Sancto blasphemiam, plane detestor,
       sive Ariana illa, sive Servetiana, sive Eunomiana, sive
       Stancariana.: [7165]1
     * Propinquus esto: [7166]1
     * Propriam enim verbi redimendi significationem intelligo, cum verum
       pretium intervenit. Verum autem pretium voco non pecuniam tantum,
       sed quicquid ut ei satisfiat qui captivum detinet datur, licet
       alioqui multa metaphorica in ejusmodi redemptione reperiantur.:
       [7167]1
     * Pugnantia to loqui non vides? quid enim tam pugnat, quam non modo
       miserum, sed omnino quidquam esse qui non sit ...: [7168]1
     * Puniendis peccatis tres esse debere causas existimatum est. Una est
       quæ: [7169]1
     * Putas Adami peccatum et inobedientiam ejus posteritati imputari. At
       hoc æque tibi negamus, quam Christi obedientiam credentibus
       imputari.: [7170]1
     * Quæ de Deo dicuntur in sacro codice : [7171]1
     * Quæ futura exempla dicunt in eum indigna: [7172]1
     * Quæ igitur est horum verborum sententia, quod mors per peccatum
       introierit in mundum: [7173]1
     * Quæ scriptura eum vocat primogenitum omnis creaturæ?: [7174]1
     * Quæ sententia ejus est? -- Deum Jesu tale corpus aptasse, postquam
       in coelum est ingressus, quod ad obeundum munus pontificis summi
       aptum et accommodatum foret.: [7175]1
     * Quæ vero ejus sententia foret lectionis? -- Admodum egregia: etenim
       admonet Christus Judæos, qui eum in sermone capere volebant, ut dum
       tempus haberent, crederent ipsum esse mundi lucem, antequam divina
       gratia, quam Christus iis offerebat, ab iis tolleretur, et ad
       Gentes transferretur. Quod vero ea verba, ego sum: [7176]1
     * Quæ vero est illa voluntas Dei per Jesum nobis patefacta? -- Est
       illud foedus novum, quod cum genere humano Christus nomine Dei
       pepigit, unde etiam mediator novi foederis vocatur: [7177]1
     * Quæ vero futura eat hujus testimonii sentontis? -- Religionem
       Christi plenam esse mysteriis: nam Deus, id est, voluntas ipsius de
       servandis hominibus, per homines infirmos et mortales perfecte
       patefacta eat; et nihilominus tamen propter miracula et Tirtutes
       varias quæ per homines illos infirmos et mortales edita fuerant,
       pro vera eat agnita; eadem ab ipsis angelis fuit demum perspecta;
       non solum Judæis, verum etiam Gentibus fuit prædicata: omnes ei
       crediderunt, et insignem in modum, et summa cum gloria recepta
       fuit.: [7178]1
     * Quæ vero sunt ilia quæ illi de Christo e Scripturis evincere
       laborant quæ illic non habentur? -- Est illius, ut loquuntur,
       prææternitas, quam duplici scripturarum genere approbare nituntur.
       Primum ejusmodi est, in quo præ-æternitatem hanc expressam putant.
       Secundum, in quo licet expressa non sit, earn tamen colligi
       arbitrantur.: [7179]1
     * Quæ vero sunt scripturæ e quibus illi opinionem suam adatruere
       conantur? -- Eæ quæ testantur Christum vel pro peccatis nostris
       mortuum, deinde, quod nos redemit, ant dedit semetipsum et animam
       suam redemptionem pro multis; tum quod noster mediator est. Porro
       quod nos reconciliarit Deo, et sit propitiatio pro peccatis
       nostris. Deniquc, ex illis sacrificiis quæ mortum Christi seu
       figuræ adumbraverunt.: [7180]1
     * Quæ vero sunt testimonia Scripturæ in quibus putant non exprimi
       quidem præ-æternitatem Christi, ex iis tamen effici posse? -- Ea
       quæ videntur Domino Jesu quasdam res attribuere ab æterno, quasdam
       vero tempore certo et definito.: [7181]1
     * Quædam ex falsissimis principiis deducuntur. In illo genere illud
       potissimum est, quod ex peccato (ut vocant) originali depromitur:
       de quo ita disputant, ut crimen a primo parente conceptum, in
       sobolem derivatum esse defendant, ejusque contagione, tum omnes
       humanas vires corruptas et depravatas, tum potissimum voluntatis
       libertatem destructam esse asserant, ... quæ omnia nos pernegamus,
       utpote et sanæ mentis rationi, et divinæ Scripturæ contraria.:
       [7182]1
     * Quænam ea loca Scripturæ quæ videntur Christo quædam tempore certo
       et definito attribnere? -- Ea sunt duplicia; quorum alia nomina,
       alia facta respiciunt, quæ Christo a Scriptura attribui opinantur.:
       [7183]1
     * Quænam ea sunt quæ ad personam ipsius referuntur? -- Id solum, quod
       natura sit homo verus, quemadmodum ea de re crebro Scripturæ sacræ
       testautur, inter alias, : [7184]1
     * Quænam sunt perfecta mandata Dei per Christum patefacta? -- Pars
       eorum continetur in præceptis a Mose traditis, una cum iis quæ sunt
       eis in novo foedere addita; pars veto continetur in iis quæ
       peculiariter ipse Christus præscripsit.: [7185]1
     * Quænam sunt quæ Christi nomina respiciunt? -- Ea, ubi arbitrantur
       Jesum a Scriptura vocari Jehovam; Dominum exercituum; Deum verum;
       solum verum; Deum magnum; Dominum Deum omnipotentem, qui fuit, qui
       est, et qui venturus est; Deum qui acquisivit proprio sanguine
       ecclesiam; Deum qui animam posuit pro nobis: [7186]1
     * Quænam sunt testimonia Scripturæ quæ videntur ipsis eam
       præ-æternitatem exprimere? -- Sunt ea in quibus Scriptura testatur
       de Christo, ipsum fuisse in principio, fuisse in coelo, fuisse ante
       Abrahamum: [7187]1
     * Quænam sunt testimonia quæ Domino Jesu ab æterno res quasdam
       attribuere videntur? -- Sunt ea ex quibus conantur exstruere
       Christum ab æterno ex essentia Patris genitum.: [7188]1
     * Quæstio est de immortalitate hominis hujus concreti, ex anima et
       corpore conflati. Quando loquor de morte, de dissolutione hujus
       concreti loquor.: [7189]1
     * Qua ratione illud intelligendum est, Sermonem carnem fuisse:
       [7190]1
     * Qua ratione locum hunc totum intelligis? -- Ad eum modum, quod
       Christus, qui in mundo, instar Dei, opera Dei efficiebat, et cui,
       sicut Deo, omnia parebant, et cui divina adoratio exhibebatur, --
       ita volente Deo, et hominum salute exigente, -- factus est tanquam
       servus et mancipium, et tanqusm unus ex aliis vulgaribus hominibus,
       cum ultro se capi, vinciri, cædi, et occidi permiserat.: [7191]1
     * Qua ratione respondes ad id testimonium? -- Ex eo, quod dicatur
       Christus esse cum Patre unum, efiiei non posse esse unum cum co
       nature, verba Christi, quæ ad Patrem de discipulis habuit,
       demonstrant:: [7192]1
     * Qua ratione vero utrumque demonstras? -- Peccata quæ sub vetere
       foedere expiari non potuere omnia sub novo expiari, testatur
       apostolus Paulus in: [7193]1
     * Qua ratione? -- Quod ad id quod fallax sit et erronea, attinct, id
       hinc perspicuum est, quod non solum de ea nihil extet in
       Scripturis, verum etiam Scripturis et sanæ rationi repugnat?:
       [7194]1
     * Quam cupiens falsam summo delabor Olympo,: [7195]1
     * Quamobrem neo eo testimonia effici prorsus potest peccatum
       originis.: [7196]1
     * Quanta distantia inter Creatorem eat et creaturam, tanta esse debet
       differentia inter honorem qui Creatori exhibetur et qui creaturæ
       tribuitur. Atqui inter Creatorem et creaturam maxima est distantia,
       sive essentiam et naturam spectes, sive dignitatem et excellentiam,
       ergo et maxima esse debet differentia inter honorem Dei et
       creaturæ. At honour qui præcipue debetur Deo est religiosa
       adoratio; ergo hæc non est tribuenda creaturæ, ergo neque Christo,
       quem tu puram esse creaturam fateris.: [7197]1
     * Quanta fortitudine dimicaverint, testimonio est, quod adverso semel
       apud Dyrrachium prælio, poenam in se ultro depoposcerunt.: [7198]1
     * Quare hæc ejus opis afferendæ ratio sacrificium vocatur? -- Vocatur
       ita figurato loquendi modo; quod quemadmodum in prisco foedere
       summus pontifex ingressus in sanctum sanctorum, ea quæ ad expianda
       peccata populi spectarent, perficiebat; ita Christus nunc
       penetravit coelos, ut illic Deo appareat pro nobis, et omnia ad
       expiationem peccatorum nostrorum spectantia peragat: [7199]1
     * Quare pænitentia Dei nihil aliud est, quam mutatio dispensationis
       ejus. Poenitet me: [7200]1
     * Quasi non necesse sit, quicquid isto modo pronunties, id ant ease,
       ant non esse. An tu dialecticis ne imbutus quidem es,: [7201]1
     * Quem Sara non patitur, quem neque nutrit Agar.: [7202]1
     * Quemadmodum etiam eodem sensu et vita et veritas dicitur.: [7203]1
     * Qui porro ad ea loca respondes, etc.? -- Quod Christus sit æqualis
       Deo, id divinam in eo naturam hullo modo probat: imo hinc res
       adversa colligitur; nam si Christus Deo, qui natura Deus est,
       æqualis est, efficitur, quod is idem Deus esse non possit. A
       Equalitas vero Christi cum Deo in eo est, quod ea virtute quam in
       eum contulit Deus, ea omnia efficeret, et efficiat, quæ ipsius Dei
       sunt, tanquam Deus ipse.: [7204]1
     * Qui respondes ad quartum testimonium? -- Eo pacto, quod hic palam
       scripture sit, non Christum fecisse, sed Deum per Christum fecisse
       secula Vocem vero secula: [7205]1
     * Qui tamen ad primum Scripturæ testimonium respondendum est? -- Id
       testimonium de generatione ex essentia Patris nihil prorsus habet;
       generationem vero præ-æternam nulla probat ratione: hic enim mentio
       fit initii et dierum, quæ in æternitate locum non habent. Et verba
       hæc, quæ in Vulgata leguntur, a diebus internitatis: [7206]1
     * Qui teneros caules alieni fregerit horti: [7207]1
     * Qui vero Scripturæ repugnat? -- Ad eum modum, quod Scripturæ passim
       Deum peccata hominibus gratuito remittere testentur: [7208]1
     * Qui vero ad hæc testimonia respondendum est? -- Antequam ad singula
       testimonia respondeam, sciendum est, eam ex essentia Patris
       generationem esse impossibilem; nam si Christus ex essentia Patris
       genitus fuisset, aut partem essentiæ sumpsisset, aut totam.
       Essentiæ partem sumere non potuit, eo quod sit impartibilis divina
       essentia; neque totam, cum sit una numero, ac proinde
       incommunicabilis.: [7209]1
     * Qui vero ad primum testimonium respondes? -- Primum, non habetur in
       primo testimonio creata sunt, verum facta sunt. Deinde, ait
       Johannes, facta esse per eum: [7210]1
     * Qui vero id conveniet iis Scripturæ locis in quibus scriptum extat,
       hominem ad imaginem Dei creatum esse, et creatum ad immortalitatem,
       et quod mors per peccatum in mundum introierit: [7211]1
     * Qui vero istud testimonium intelligis? -- Ad eum modum quo per
       Christum omnia quæ sunt in coelis et in terra postquam eum Deus a
       mortuis excitavit, reformata sunt, et in alium statum et
       conditionem translata; id vero cum Deus et angelis et hominibus
       Christum caput dederit, qui antea tantum Deum solum pro domino
       agnoverunt.: [7212]1
     * Quia abscissus est de terra viventium: [7213]1
     * Quibus enim oculis animi intueri potuit vester Plato fabricam illam
       tanti operis, qua construi a Deo atque ædificari mundum facit? Quæ
       molitio? Quæ ferrameata? Qui vectes? Quæ machinæ? Qui ministri
       tanti muneris fuerunt? Quemadmodum autem obedire et parere
       voluntati architecti ær, ignis, aqua, terra, potuerunt?: [7214]1
     * Quibus ita explicatis, facile eos qui ... omnem Adami posteritatem,
       in ipso Adamo parente suo peccasse, et mortis supplicium vere
       fuisse commeritum.: [7215]1
     * Quicquid enim ab eo qui subordinationem istam recte novit et mente
       sua illam probat, in istos confertur, in Deum ipsum confertur.:
       [7216]1
     * Quicquid enim alias de utriusque loci sententia statuas, illud
       tamen facile est cernere, Deum novun quoddam, et insigne
       experimentum, illic quidem impietatis Sodomiticæ et Gomorrhææ,
       videre voluisse, hic vero pietatis Abrahamicæ vidisse, quod
       antequam fieret, plane certum et exploratum non esset.: [7217]1
     * Quicquid enim est, dum est, necessario est.: [7218]1
     * Quicunque sacras literas assidua manu versat, quantumvis nescio
       quos catechismos, vel locos communes et commentarios quam
       familiarissimos sibi reddiderit, is statim cum nostrorum libros vel
       semel inspexerit, intelliget quantum distant æra lupinis.: [7219]1
     * Quid ad ea testimonia quæ nos a Christo testantur redemptos
       respondes? -- Resp. E verbo redimendi non posse efiici
       satisfactionem hanc, hinc est planum, quod de ipso Deo et in novo
       et in prisco foedere scribitur, eum redemisse populum suum ex
       Ægypto, eum fecisse redemptionem populo suo. Deinde cum scriptum
       sit quod Deus redemit Abrahamum et Davidem, et quod Moses fuerit
       redemptor, et quod simus redempti e nostris iniquitatibus, aut e
       vana conversatione nostra, et e maledictione legis; certum autem
       est Deum nemini satisfecisse, nec vero aut iniquitatibus, aut
       conversationi vanæ, aut legi satisfactum esse dici posse.: [7220]1
     * Quid ad eam respondes? -- Neque hinc naturam divinam Christum
       habere exsculpi posse, etenim cum Christus primogenitus omnis
       creaturæ sit, eum unum e numero creaturarum esse oportere necesse
       est; ea enim in Scripturis vis est primogeniti, ut primogenitum
       unum ex eorum genere, quorum primogenitus est, esse necesse sit:
       [7221]1
     * Quid ad hæc dicis, quod Christus sit mediator inter Deum et
       homines, aut novo foederis? -- Cum legatur Moses fuisse mediator,:
       [7222]1
     * Quid ad hoc respondes? -- Neque hinc naturam divinam probari; posse
       enim aliquem gloriam habere antequam mundus fieret, apud Patrem,
       nec tamen hinc effici eum ease Deum, apparet: [7223]1
     * Quid ad hoc respondes? -- Neque hine naturam in Christo divinam
       effici; nam hic Spiritus qui in prophetis erat, Christi dici
       potest, non quod a Christo datus fuerit, sed quod ea quæ Christi
       fuerunt prænunciarit, ut ibidem Petrus ait, prænuncians illas in
       Christum passiones, et post hæc glorias. Quem loquendi modum etiam:
       [7224]1
     * Quid ad septimum respondes? -- Respondeo, nomen Dei hoc loco non
       referri ad Christum necessario, sect ad ipsum Deum Patrem referri
       posse, cujus apostolus eum sangninem, quem Christus fudit,
       sanguinem vocat, eo genere loquendi, et eam ob causam, quo genere
       loquendi, et quam ob causam propheta ait, Eum qui tangit populum
       Dei, tangere pupillam oculi Dei ipsius: [7225]1
     * Quid ad sextum respondes? -- Eum vero locum propterea ad Christum
       referunt, quod arbitrentur neminem venturum, nisi Christum; is enim
       venturus est ad judicandum vivos et mortuos. Verum tenendum est,
       eam vocem quam illi reddidere venturus est: [7226]1
     * Quid ad tertium? -- Præter id, quod et hoc testimonium loquatur de
       Christo tanquam media et secunda causa, verbum creata sunt: [7227]1
     * Quid commemorem animosi illius Gregorii Pauli insalutato suo grege
       fugam.: [7228]1
     * Quid est Deus? Mens universi. Quid est Deus? Quod vides totum, et
       quod non vides totum. Sic demure magnitude sua illi redditur, qua
       nihil majus excogitari potest, si solus est omnia, opus suum et
       extra et intra tenet. Quid ergo interest inter naturam Dei et
       nostram? Nostri melior pars animus est, in illo nulla pars extra
       animum.: [7229]1
     * Quid his testimoniis effici potest? -- Naturam divinam in Christo
       ex iis demonstrari non posse, præter ea quæ superius allata sunt,
       hint manifestum est, quod in primo testimonio agatur de Verbo, quod
       Johannes testatur apud ilium Deum fuisse; in secundo, Thomas eum
       appellat Deum, in cujus pedibus et manibus, clavorum, in latere
       lanceæ vestigia deprehendit; et Paulus eum qui secundum carnem a
       patribus erat, Deum supra omnia benedictum vocat. Quæ omnia dici de
       eo qui natura Deus sit, nullo mode posse, planum est, etenim ex
       illo sequeretur duos esse Deos, quorum alter apud alterum fuerit.
       Hæc vero, vestigia vulnerum habere, eque patribus esse, hominis
       sunt prorsus, quæ ei, qui natura Deus sit, ascribi nimis absonum
       esset. Quod si illud distinctionis naturarum velum quis prætendat,
       jam superius illud amovimus, et docuimus hanc dis-tinctionem nullo
       modo posse sustineri.: [7230]1
     * Quid interea bonus ille Hosius Cardinalis cum suis Catholicis?
       Nempe ridere suaviter, et quasi ista nihil ad ipsos pertinerent,
       aliud quidvis agere, imo etiam nostros undique, ad extinguendum hoc
       incendium accurentes, probrosis libellis arcessere.: [7231]1
     * Quid mihi scire quæ futura sunt? Quæcunque ille vult, hæc futura
       sunt.: [7232]1
     * Quid porro ad tertium respondebis? -- Apostolus eo in loco non agit
       de immortalitate [mortalitate], verum de morte ipsa Mortalitas vero
       a morte multum dissidet; siquidem potest esse quis mortalis, nec
       tamen unquam mori.: [7233]1
     * Quid præterea Dominus Jesus huic præcepto primo addidit? -- Id quod
       etiamnum Dominum Jesum pro Deo cognoscere tenemur, id est, pro eo
       qui in nos potestatem habet divinam, et cui nos divinum exhibere
       honorem obstricti sumus.: [7234]1
     * Quid præterea huic præcepto primo Dominus Jesus addidit? -- Id quod
       etiam Dominum Jesum pro Deo agnoscere tenemur; id est, pro eo qui
       in nos potestatem habet divinam et cui nos divinum exhibere honorem
       obstricti sumus.: [7235]1
     * Quid respondes ad tertium? -- In hoc testimonio, Scimus Filium Dei
       venisse: [7236]1
     * Quid to ipse poenis gravibus infestus gravas: [7237]1
     * Quid tu ad hæc? -- Vox : [7238]1
     * Quid vero ad primum respendes? -- In loco citato nihil habetur de
       ista præ-æternitate, cum hic principii mentio fiat, quod
       præ-æternitati oppenitur. Principii vero vox in Scripturis fere
       semper ad subjectam refertur materiam, ut videre est: [7239]1
     * Quid vero ea de re sentis quod David ait: [7240]1
     * Quid vero per hæc, Mundus per cum factus est: [7241]1
     * Quid vero respondes ad secundum? -- Primum, quod hic non scribat
       Johannes mundum esse creatum, sed factum. Deinde, eo loquendi mode
       utitur, qui mediam causam designat, ait enim, mundum per eum
       factum: [7242]1
     * Quid vero sentis de iis hominibus qui Christum non invocant, nec
       invocandum censent? -- Prorsus non esse Christianos sentio: cum
       reipsa Christum non habeant, et licet verbis id negare non audeant,
       repsa tamen negent.: [7243]1
     * Quid vero tu ad ea ordine respondes, ac ante omnia ad primum? --
       Primum, quod ex eo confici non possit necessario nomen Jehovæ
       Christo attribui. Ea enim verba, Et hoc eat nomen ejus quo vocabunt
       eum, Jehovah justita nostra: [7244]1
     * Quid veto de hac reconciliatione sentis? -- Christum Jesum nobis,
       qui propter peccata nostra Dei inimici eramus et ab eo abalienati,
       viam ostendisse, quemadmodum nos ad Deum converti, atque ad eum
       modum ei reconciliari oporteat.: [7245]1
     * Quie dicuntur de Deo : [7246]1
     * Quincunque dicit Adam primum hominem mortalem factum, ita ut sive
       peccaret sive non peccaret, moreretur in corpore, hoc est de
       corpore exiret non peccati merito ned necessitate naturæ, anathema
       sit.: [7247]1
     * Quis sine lacte precor, vel quis sine sanguine vivat?: [7248]1
     * Quo in logo epitheton magni Dei : [7249]1
     * Quocumque to fiexeris, ibi illum (Deum) videbis occurrentem tibi.
       Nihil ab illo vacat: opus suum ipse implet.: [7250]1
     * Quod ad testimonium attinet, quod hominem creatum ad imaginem Dei
       pronunciat, sciendum est, imaginem Dei non significare
       immortalitatem (quod hinc patet, quod Scriptura, eo tempore quo
       homo æternæ morti subjectus erat, agnoscat in homine istam
       imaginem: [7251]1
     * Quod attinet ad ilia testimonia in quibus habetur Christum pro
       nobis mortuum, ex iis satisfactionem adstrui necessario non posse
       hinc manifestum est, quod Scriptura testetur etiam nos pro
       fratribus animas ponere debere,: [7252]1
     * Quod erat demonstrandum: [7253]1
     * Quod nec tangi, nec cerni potest Deus, neque sub mensuram, vel
       terminum cadit aut alicui est corpori simile.: [7254]1
     * Quod res sunt futuræ, a voluntate Dei est (effectiva vel
       permissiva).: [7255]1
     * Quod si Weikus intelligit damnandi verbo nostros ministros
       censuisse illum aliqua sfficiendum, aut vuit fallere, aut egregie
       fallitur: nam certum est, in judicio illo, cum minister quidam
       Calvinianus Christophero, Principi, qui toti actioni interfuit, et
       præfuit, satis longa oratione persuasisset, ut talem, hominem e
       medio tolleret, minitans everenter illi supplicasse, ut miseri
       hominis misereri vellet et clementem et benignum se erga illum
       præbere.: [7256]1
     * Quod si proprie æcipi debeant, quod nos perlibenter admittimus,
       apparet non de alio illa dicta quam de Filio hominis, qui cum
       personam humanam necessario habeat, Deus natura esse non potest.
       Porro, quod Scriptura testatur de Christo, quod Pater eum miserit
       in mundum, idem de apostolis Christi legimus in iisdem verbis
       citatis superius: Quemadmodum me misisti in mundum, et ego misi eos
       in mundum: [7257]1
     * Quod si quis tanta est fide præditus, ut ad Deum ipsum perpetuo
       recte accedere audeat, huic non opus est ut Christum invocet.:
       [7258]1
     * Quod totum fere pondus illius disputationis, adversus eos qui
       Christum adhuc ignorare dici possunt, sustinueris, vehementer tibi
       gratulor: nihil mihi novum fuit, ex narratione ista percipere,
       pastores illos Lithuanicos ab ejusmodi ignoratione minime liberos
       deprehensos fuisse.: [7259]1
     * Quod ut commodius facere posset in Angliam se contulit, ibique in
       Oxoniensi gymnasio aliquandiu se exercuit: [7260]1
     * Quod vero attinet ad dictum Domini Jesu, Qui me videt videt Patrem:
       [7261]1
     * Quod vero character hypostaseos ejus dictus sit, hoc intelligi
       debet: Deus quicquid nobis promisit, jam reipsa in eo exhibuisse.':
       [7262]1
     * Quod vero ea ratione expientur peccata sub novo foedere ut etiam
       æterna poena amoveatur, et vita æterna donetur, habetur: [7263]1
     * Quodnam eat discrimen inter veteris, et novi foederis peceatorum
       expiationem? -- Expiatio peccatorum sub novo fodere non solum
       distat ab expiatione peccatorum sub vetere plurimum, verum etiam
       longe præstantior et excellentior est: id vero duabus potissimum de
       causis. Prior est, quod sub vetere foedere, iis tantum peccatis
       expiatio, per illa legalia sacrificia, constituta fuit, quæ per
       imprudentiam vel per infirmitatem admissa fuere, unde etiam
       infirmitates et ignorantiæ nuncupabantur. Verum pro peccatis
       gravioribus, quæ transgressiones erant mandati Dei manifestsæ,
       nulla sacrificia instituta fuerant, sed mortis poena fuit
       propesita. Quod si talia Deus alicui condonabat, id non vi foederis
       fiebat, sed misericordia Dei singulari, quam Deus citra foedus, et
       quando et cui libuit exhibebat. Sub novo vero foedere peccata
       expiantur, non solum per imprudentiam et infirmitatem admissa,
       verum etiam ea quæ apertissimorum Dei mandatorum sunt
       transgressiones, dummodo is cui labi ad eum modum contigerit, in eo
       non perseveret, verum per veram poenitentiam resipiscat, nec ad
       illud peccatum amplius relabatur. Posterior vero causa est, quod
       sub prisco foedere ad eum modum peccatorum expiatio peragebatur, ut
       poena temporaria tantum ab iis quorum peccata expiabantur
       tolleretur; sub novo vero ea est expiatio, ut non solum poenas
       temporarias, verum etiam æternas amoveat, et loco poenarum, æternam
       vitam, in foedere promissam, iis quorum peccata fuerint expiata,
       offerat.: [7264]1
     * Quomodo ad primum respondes? -- Ea ratione, quod in eo testimonio
       non habeatur Deum (ut loquuntur) incarnatum ease, aut quod natura
       divina assumpserit humanam. Aliud enim est, Verbum caro factum est,
       aliud, Deus incarnatus est (ut loquuntur) vel natura divina
       assumpsit humanam. Præterea, hæc verba, Verbum caro factum est:
       [7265]1
     * Quomodo ergo poenitentia cadat in Deum?: [7266]1
     * Quomodo primogenitus esse potuit, nisi quia secundum divinitatem
       ante omnem creaturam ex Deo Patre Sermo processit.: [7267]1
     * Quomodo vero ad hæc loca respondetur? -- Ex iis omnibus attributis
       Christi hullo modo probari posse naturam ejus divinam; nam quod ad
       primum attinet, notissimum est Petrum fateri, quod Filius hominis
       sit Christus, et Filius Dei viventis, quem constat divinam naturam,
       qualem illi comminiscuntur, non habuisse. Præterea, testatur
       Scriptura de aliis hominibus quod sint filii Dei viventis, ut ex
       Hosea: [7268]1
     * Quoniam me verbo premis, posthac non ira dicam, miseros esse, sed
       tantum, miseros, ob id ipsum quia non sunt.: [7269]1
     * Quotquot hactenus theologica tractarunt, id sibi negotii
       crediderunt solum dari, ut quam sive sors illis obtulerat, sive
       judicio amplexi erant sententiam, totis illam viribus tuerentur.:
       [7270]1
     * Rationem addunt, quod absurdum sit, Deum irasci in æternum; et
       peccata creaturarum finita, poenis infinitis mulctare: pracærtim
       cum hinc nulla ipsius gloria illustretur.: [7271]1
     * Recte igitur existimasti, mlhl quoque verisimile videri, eum qui
       Dominum Jesum Christum invocare non vult, aut non audet, vix
       Christiani nomine dignum esse: nisi quod non modo vix, sed ne vix
       quidem, et non modo verisimile id mihi videtur, sed persuasissimum
       mihi est.: [7272]1
     * Recte, quia Christus vobis lapis scandali est: [7273]1
     * Redimere aliquem est debitum solvere creditoris ejus nomine, qui
       solvendo non erat, sicque satisfacere creditori: [7274]1
     * Regemque dedit, qui foedere certo: [7275]1
     * Reges, ut Nebuchodonosor Chaldæorum, et Nechos Ægyptiorum, eorumque
       satrapæ, admirabuntur cum silentio, ubi videbunt omnia quæ dicet
       Jeremias ita adamussim et suis temporibus impleta: [7276]1
     * Regula, peccatis quæ poenas irroget æquas:: [7277]1
     * Reisque dona veniam;: [7278]1
     * Rem scio, prensabo si fas erit ubera dextra,: [7279]1
     * Requiritur et is qui captivum detineat, alioqui captivus non esset.
       Huic in liberatione nostra, si exactius rem ipsam considerare
       velimus, respondent multa. Multa siquidem nos tanquam captivos
       detinebant; ea autem sunt peccatum, diabolus, mundus, et quæ
       peccatum consequuntur, mortis æternæ reatus, seu mortis æternæ
       nobis decretum supplicium.: [7280]1
     * Respondeo particulis istis exclusivis, qualis et solus, et similis,
       cum de Deo usurpantur, nunquam cos simpliciter excludi, qui a Deo,
       in ea re de qua agitur, dependent. Sic dicitur solus Deus sapiens,
       solus potens, solus immortalis, neque tamen simpliciter a
       sapientia, a potentia, ab immortalitate excludi debent et alii, qui
       istarum rerum participes sunt effecti. Quare jam cum solus Deus
       adorandus aut invocandus esse dicitur, excludi simpliciter non
       debet is, qui hac in parte a Deo pendet, propter divinum ab ipso in
       cuncta acceptum imperium, sed potius tacite simul includendus est.:
       [7281]1
     * Revera ne unum quidem versiculum video, qui de Jeremiah exponi
       posit: qua ratione de eo dicetur, Extolletur et altus erit valde?'
       Item illud, propter eum obdent reges os suum,' am ætas ilia
       prophetas habere consueverat. Quomodo etiam dici potest morbos
       nostros portasse, et dolores nostros bajulasse, et in tumice ejus
       curationem nobis esse, Deum in ipsum incurrere fecisse peccata
       omnium nostrum: quasi ipsi poena incubuisset, et Israel fuisset
       immunis? Jam illud, Propter peccatum populi mei plaga ipsis,' item,
       Dedit cum improbis sepulcrum ejus,' ad ipsum referri nequit; multo
       minus illud, Videbit semen, prolongabit dies,' item, cum robustis
       partietur spolium.' In quibus omnibus nihil est quod de ipso
       commode affirmari possit. Unde vehementer miror, quomodo R. Hagaon
       in hanc sententiam perduci potuerit, et sapientes dari qui hanc
       expositionem laudant; cum tamen tota ista exponendi ratio plane
       aliena sit, et e Scriptura non facta.: [7282]1
     * Reverende domine, sæpe tibi molestus esse cogor: [7283]1
     * Rideat ut dulci moestus amore dolor.: [7284]1
     * Rogatum to velim, ut mihi ca de Jesu Christo exponas, quæ me scire
       opertest? -- Sciendum tibi est, quædam ad essentiam Jesu Christi,
       quædam ad illius munus referri, quæ te scire oportet.: [7285]1
     * Rogavit me dominus Schomanus, dominus Simon Ronembergins, et alii,
       ut ad parænesin Andræ Volani responderem, volui ut si quid in hac
       respousione vobis minus recte dictum videretur, non bona
       conscientia tantum, sed jure etiam, eam semper ejurare possetis.:
       [7286]1
     * Rursum, quod de Deo dictum fuerat Messiæ aptat; quia constabat
       inter Hebræos, et Mundum hunc Messiæ causa conditum (unde: [7287]1
     * Sacerdotii: [7288]1
     * Salva proprietate utriusque naturæ, suscepta est a majestate
       humilitas, a virtute infirmitas, ab æternitate modalitas.: [7289]1
     * Sanctitas Sanctitatum: [7290]1
     * Sanguinem pro redemptionis pretio vero Domino offerto: [7291]1
     * Sanguini autem purgatio ista tribuitur, quia per sanguinem, id est,
       mortem Christi, secuta ejus excitatione et evectione, giguitur in
       nobis tides: [7292]1
     * Satis est ad ostendendum, Deum in generatione Christi vices viri
       supplevisse, si ostendatur Deum id ad Christi generationem
       adjecisse, quod in generatione hominis ex parte viri ad hominem
       producendum adjici solet.: [7293]1
     * Sciendum, quod omnino aliter se habet antiqua vel æterna scientia
       ad ea quæ fiunt et facta sunt, et aliter recens scientia: esse
       namque rei entis est causa scientiæ nostræ, scientia vero æterna
       est causa ut ipsa res sit. Si vero quando res est postquam non
       erat, contingeret noviter in ipsa scientia antiqua, scientia
       superaddita, quemadmodum contingit hoc in scientia nova, sequeretur
       utique quod ipsa scientia antiqua esset causata ab ipso ente: et
       non esset causa ipsius, oportet ergo quod non contingat ibi
       mutatio, scilicet in antiqua scientia, quemadmodum contingit in
       nova: sciendum autem, quod hic error idcirco accidit, quia scientia
       antiqua mensuratur ab imperitis cum scientia nova, cujus
       mensurationis modus vitiosissimus est: projicit quippe quandoque
       hominem in barathrum, unde nunquam est egressurus.: [7294]1
     * Scientia libera, quia fundatur in voluntate: [7295]1

       nostram salutem, ab omni traditionum humanarum labe, ipsa divina
       veritate literis sacris comprehensa repurgare nituntur, et
       expeditissima explicandæ Dei gloriæ, honoris Christo Domino nostro
       asserendi, et salutis consequendæ ratione excerpta, ac omnibus
       proposita eam ipsissima sacrarum literarum authoritate sancire et
       stabilire conantur.: [7299]1
     * Securæ ut variæ sint mihi forte vices.: [7300]1
     * Sed cur quæso absurdum est affirmare septem illos spiritus a
       Johanne fuisse invocatos? An quia solus Deus est invocandus? Atqui
       hanc rationem nihili ease tota ilia disputatione demonstratur, non
       modo quia nunquam diserte interdictum est, quemquam alium præter
       Deum ipsum invocare, sed etiam, et multo magis, quia ejusmodi
       interdictiones (ut sic loquar) nunquam cos excludunt qui ipsi Deo
       sunt subordinati.: [7301]1
     * Sed dico (si deinde oculos in vulnera verto),: [7302]1
     * Sed et intellectum duplicem video; alter enim intelligere potest,
       quamvis non intelligat, alter etiam intelligit qui tamen nondum est
       perfectus, nisi et semper intelligat, et omnia; et ille demum
       absolutissimus futurus sit, qui et semper, et omnia, et simul
       intelligat.: [7303]1
     * Semper ea quæ de se prædicare cogitur Christus, ita temperat ut
       onmem honorem referat ad Patrem, et removeat illud crimen, quasi
       hominem Patri æqualem faciat.: [7304]1
     * Sensum bonum facit illud: [7305]1
     * Sensus est: Non venditavit Christus, non jactavit istam potestatem:

     * Sensus primus et apertus ad Davidem pertinet; mysticus et
       abstrusior ad Messiam, ut hic agnoscit David Kimchi, et ad Danielem
       Saadius Gaon, quo modo sumsere apostoli.: [7307]1
     * Sententia vero loci hujus est, Christum originem nativitatis suæ ab
       ipso principio et annis antiquis ducturum; id est, ab eo tempore,
       quo Deus in populo suo regem stabilivit, quod reipsa in Davide
       factum est, qui et Bethlehemita fult, et autor stirpis et familiæ
       Christi.: [7308]1

       Christo adoratio et invocatio conveniunt, quæ solius Dei illius
       altissimi omni ratione videtur esse propria.: [7314]1
     * Si in eo sita est dilectio, quod Deus nos dilexerit et Filium suum
       miserit: [7315]1
     * Si non jurabis, non regnabis: [7316]1
     * Si non reddit faciendo quod debet reddet patiendo quod debet.:
       [7317]1
     * Si quæ sit vocabuli adoptivus' significatio ex mente sacrarum
       literarum consideretur, nos non inficiari Christum suo modo esse
       adoptivum Dei Filium; quia enim adoptivi filii ea est conditio et
       proprietas, ut talis non sit natus qualis factus est post
       adoptionem. Certe quia Christus talis natura, vel in ipsa
       conceptione et nativitate non fuit, qualis postea fuit ætate
       accedente, sine injuria adoptivus Dei Filius eo modo dici potest.:
       [7318]1
     * Si spatium vacat super caput Creatoris, et si Deus ipse in loco
       est, erit jam locus ille major et Deo et mundo; nihil enim non
       majus est id quod capit, illo quod capitur.: [7319]1
     * Sibi licere prædicans quicquid Deo licet; neque magis Sabbato se
       adstringi. Crassa calumnia.: [7320]1
     * Sic: [7321]1
     * Sic Deus dilexit mundum, ut Filium suum genitum daret: [7322]1
     * Sic in Græco: [7323]1
     * Sic me perpetuum vulnus et uber alit.: [7324]1
     * Sicut ovis: [7325]1
     * Significat enim Christus id, quod ratio ilia dictat, Deum, cum
       spiritus sit, non spiritualibus revera delectari.: [7326]1
     * Simile loquendi genus. Sic Legem fuisse ante mundum: [7327]1
     * Simile quod affers de vocabulis "essentiæ," et "personarum" a nobis
       repudiatis, quia in sanctis literis non inveniantur, non est
       admittendum, nemini enim vere cordato persuadebitis id quod per ea
       vocabuli adversarii significare voluerunt, idcirco repudiandum
       esse, quia ipsa vocabula scripta non inveniantur, imo quicunque ex
       nobis hac ratione sunt usi, suspectam apud nonnullos, alioquin
       ingenio, et eruditione præstantes viros, causam nostram reddidere.:
       [7328]1
     * Similis factus servis: [7329]1

     * Socinismus est verecundior aut subtilior Mahumetismus. Censemus
       scripta Socinianorum ad Turcismum proxime accedere.: [7333]1
     * Socinus affirmat Deum in generatione Christi vices patris
       supplevisse: [7334]1
     * Socinus autem videtur rectius de SS. opinari.: [7335]1
     * Solent quidam miriones ædificari in ruinam.: [7336]1
     * Speciem et pondus videtur habere hæc objectio; nec pauci sunt, qui
       ejus vi adeo moventur, ut divinam futurorum contingentium
       præscientiam negate, et quæ pro ea facere videntur loca, atque
       argumenta, magno conatu torquere malint, et flectere in sensus, non
       minus periculosos quam difficiles. Ad me quod attinet, ego hactenus
       sive religione quadam animi, sive divinæ majestatis reverentia, non
       potui prorsus in animum meum inducere, rationem istam allegatam
       tanti esse, ut propter eam Deo futurorum contingentium præscientia
       detrahenda sit; maxime cum vix videam, quomodo alioquin divinarum
       prædictionum veritas salvari possit, sine aliqua aut incertitudinis
       macula, aut falsi possibilis suspicione.: [7337]1
     * Spero fore, ut, si quid ilium mecum sentire vetet intellexero,
       facile viam inveniam eum in meam sententiam pertrahendi.: [7338]1
     * Spiritus Sanctitatis: [7339]1
     * Spiritus est Deus: animadverterunt ibi omnes prope S. literarum
       interpretes, Dei nomen, quod articulo est in Græco notatum,
       Subjecti locum tenere: vocem, spiritus, quæ articulo caret,
       prædicati: et spiritualem significare substautiam. Ita perinde est
       ac si dictum fuisset, Deus est spiritus, seu spiritualis
       substantia.: [7340]1
     * Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus: [7341]1

       alienum, de eo abs to viro eruditissimo," etc. "cujus judicium
       plurimi facio moneri percupio.: [7346]1
     * Sunt quidem plurima dicta quaæ ostendunt Christum peculiari prorsus
       nec ulli alio communi ratione esse Dei Filium; non tamen hinc
       concludere licet eum ease naturali ratione filium, cum præter hanc,
       et illam communem, alia dari possit, et in Christo reipsa locum
       habeat. Nonne singulari prorsus ratione, nec ulli com-muni, Dei
       Filius est Christus, si ab ipso Deo, vi et efficacia Spiritus
       Sancti, in utero virginis conceptus fuit et genitus?: [7347]1
     * Suspectam nobis hanc lectionem faciunt interpretes veteres,
       Latinus, Syrus, Arabs, et Ambrosius, qui omnes legunt: [7348]1
     * Tam vera est hac de re mea certitudo, quam verum est apostolum de
       Christodixisse, Adorent eum omnes angeli: [7349]1
     * Tamen Deo Visum est eum conterere et infirmare: [7350]1

     * Thomas ad Christum ait, Dominus meus et Deus meus: [7354]1
     * Tibi significo me ni fallor invenisse viam quomodo verum esse
       possit, quod Christus plane libere et citra omnem necessitatem Deo
       perfectissime obediret et tamen necessarium omnino fuerit ut sic
       obediret; quænam ista via sit, nisi eam ipse per te (ut plane
       spero) inveneeris, postea tibi aperiam: volo enim prius tuum hosæ
       iin re et Statorii ingenium experiri, tametsi vereor ne jam eam
       illi indicaverim.: [7355]1
     * Totum hoc factum est: [7356]1
     * Tradunt de prophets quod die quodam dixerit Gabrieli, O Gabriel,
       optem to in specie figurnæ turn magnæ videre, secundum quam Deus
       creavit te. Dixit Gabriel, O dilecte Deo, est figura mea valde
       terribilis; nemo eam poterit videre, et sic neque tu, quin animi
       deliquium passus concidat. Reponit Mahumed, Etsi maxime ita sit,
       velim tamen to videre in figura majori. Respondit ergo Gabriel, O
       dilecte Deo, ubi me videre desideras? Extra urbem Meccam, respondit
       Mahumed, in villa lapidosa. Dixit Gabriel, Villa ista me non
       capiet. Ergo respondit Mahumed, In monte Orphath. Hic, inquit
       Gabriel, locus aptior erit et capacior. Abiit ergo Mahumed in
       montem Orphath, et ecce Gabriel, cum magno fragore et strepitu,
       totum figura sua operiens horizontem; quod cum propheta vidisset,
       concidit, deliquium passus, in terram. Ubi vero Gabriel, super quo
       pax, ad priorem rediisset figuram, accessit ad prophetam, eumque
       amplexus et osculatus, ita compellavit, Ne timeas, O dilecte Deo,
       sum enim frater tuus Gabriel. Dixit propheta, Vera dixisti, O
       frater mi Gabriel: nunquam existimassem ullum esse Dei creaturam
       tanta præditam figura. Respondit Gabriel, O dilecte Deo, quid si
       igitur videres figuram Europhil angeli?: [7357]1
     * Tu vero quid ad hæc? -- Ex eo naturam divinam probari non posse,
       cum certain ob causam Pater æternitatis Christus sit vocatus, ex
       ipsis verbis ibidem paulo superius expressis videre est. Mirum veto
       est adversarios hunc locum, ubi agitur de Patre æterno, ad Filium
       referre, quem constat secundum cos ipsos Patrem non esse. Pater
       vero æternitatis aut futuri seculi propterea dictus est Christus,
       quod sit princeps et autor vitæ æternæ, quæ futura est.: [7358]1
     * Tua ista certitudo non potest et mihi et aliis esse veritatis
       regula, nam reperietur alius quispiam, qui dicat, sententiam tuæ
       contrariam ex sacris libris sibi esse persuasissimam.: [7359]1
     * Tum autem hoc reipsa factum est, cum Jesus Christus illi populo
       primum apparuit, et post toti mundo annunciatus est.: [7360]1
     * Tuque parens monstra, matrem to jure vocari,: [7361]1

     * Ubi vero Scriptura de Christo ait, quod de coelo descendit, a Patre
       exivit: [7365]1
     * Ubi vero Scriptura testatur Christum cum Patre esse unum?: [7366]1
     * Ubi vero scriptores sacri id fecerunt? -- Inter alia multa
       testimonia, habes: [7367]1
     * Ubi vero scriptum est Christum fuisse in coelo, etc.coelo missum?:
       [7368]1
     * Ubi vero scriptura eum omnia quæ Pater habeat habere asserit?:
       [7369]1
     * Una litura potest: [7370]1
     * Unde apparet Christum nobis Dei voluntatem perfecte manifestasse?
       -- Hinc, quod ipse Jesus perfectissima ratione eam a Deo in coelis
       sit edoctus, et ad eam hominibus publicandam e coelo magnifice sit
       missus, et eam perfecte iisdem annuntiavit.: [7371]1
     * Uno mentis cernit in ictu Quæ sint,: [7372]1
     * Unum Deum, et unum ejus Filium, et verbum, imaginemque, quantum
       possumus supplicationibus, et honoribus veneremur, offerentes Deo
       universorum Domino preces per suum unigenitum: cui prius eas
       adhibemus rogantes ut ipse, qui est propitiator pro peccatis
       nostris, dignetur tanquam pontifex preces nostras, et sacrificia et
       intercessiones, offerre Deo.: [7373]1
     * Ut ad rationem istam non minus plene quam plane respondeamus,
       animadvertendum est, infallibilem istam Dei prænotionem, quam pro
       re concessa adversarii sumunt, a nobis non admitti.: [7374]1
     * Ut me læta pio mista dolore juvent.: [7375]1

     * Ut vero unus e rebus conditis creationis veteris existat Dominus
       Jesus, nec adversarii quidem concedent, nisi Ariani esse velint.
       Unum igitur esse e novæ creationis genere Dominum Jesum concedant
       oportet. Unde non solum divina Christi natura effici non potest,
       verum etiam quod nunam divinam naturam Christus habeat firmiter
       conficitur. Quod vero eo nomine vocatur ab apostolo Jesus, eo fit,
       quod tempore et præstantia res onmes novæ creationis longe
       antecedat.: [7377]1
     * Utrum primus homo ante peccatum justitiam aliquam originalem
       habuerit? Plerique omnes eum illam habuisse affirmant. Sed ego
       scire velim ... concludamus igitur, Arlamum, etiam antequam
       mandatum illud Dei transgrederetur, revera justum non fuisse. Cum
       nec impeccabilis esset, nec ullum peccandi occasionem habuisset;
       vel certe justum eum fuisse affirmari non posse, cum nullo modo
       constet, eum ullaratione a peccando abstinuisse.: [7378]1

     * Veruntamen esse peccatum originis illa testimonia docere videntur:
       [7383]1
     * Via remotionis utendum est, in Dei consideratione: nam divina

     * Videtur autem hoc imprimis modo diabolus insidias struere Domino
       Jesu, dum scilicet tales excitat, qui non dubitant affirmare
       Dominum Jesum nunc plane esse otiosum in coelis, et res humanas vel
       salutem hominum non aliter curare, quam Moses curat salutem
       Judæorum. Qui quidem homines, professione videri volunt Christiani,
       interne veto Christum abnegarunt, et spiritu judaico, qui semper
       Christo fuit inimicissimus, infiati sunt; et si quis jure cum eis
       agere velit, indigni plane sunt, qui inter Christianos numerentur,
       quantumvis ore tenus Christum profiteantur, et multa de eo
       garriant; adeo ut multo tolerabilior sit error illorum qui Christum
       pro illo uno Deo habent et colunt, quam istorum: et præstet, ex
       duobus malis minus quod aiunt eligendo, Trinitarium quam hujusmodi
       blasphemum esse.: [7416]1
     * Vidi civitatem sanctam, Hierusalem novam, descendentem de coelo a
       Deo: [7417]1
     * Vidi ego dum plaustro per ora vulgi traducitur, illudentem theologo
       e Franciscanis, cujus cura mollire ferocitatem animi obstinati.
       Lucilius ferocitate contumax, dum in patibulum traditus, monachi
       solarium aspernatus objectam crucem aversatur, Christoque illudit
       in hæc eadem verba: Illi in extremis præ timore imbellis sudor, ego
       imperterritus morior.' Falso sane imperterritum se dixit scelestus
       homo, quem vidimus dejectum animo, philosophia uti pessime, cujus
       se mentiebatur professorem. Erat illi in extremis aspectus ferox et
       horridus, inquieta mens, anxium quodcunque loquebatur; et quanquam
       philosophice mori se clamabat identidem, finiisse ut brutum nemo
       negaverit. Antequam rogosubderetur ignis; jussus sacrilegam linguam
       cultro submittere, negat, neque exerit, nisi forcipum vi
       apprehensam carnifex ferro abscindit: non alias vociferatio
       horridior: diceres mugire ictum bovem, etc. Hic Lucilii Vanini
       finis, cui quanta constantia fuerit, probat belluinus in morte
       clamour. Vidi ego in custodia, vidi in patibulo, videram antequam
       subiret vincula: flagitiosus in libertate, et voluptatum sectator

       (quam rem superius expressit per participationem carnis et
       sanguinis), propterea Christus ultro illis se submisit, ut fideles
       suos a mortis metu liberaret, et in omni afflictione iisdem opern
       afferret.: [7888]1
     * videre est. Apparet igitur neque ex hoc loco extrui posse peccatum

       hæreses, quibus felix ilia quondam insula et orthodoxiæ tenacissima
       hodie conspurcatur, tantum eminet Socinianismus, quantum lenta
       solent inter viburna Cupressi;' nec enim amplius ibi horrenda sua

     * vocem Græcum Johannes in hac epistola sæpe ad eum refert, qui longe
       antea nominatus fuerat, ut et: [7903]1
     * vocetur Pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi. Secundus modus est, quia
       Jesus Christus ratione muneris illius, quod a Patre speciali
       mandato impositum ei fuit, ut rex Israelis esset, promissus ille
       per prophetas, et prævisus ante secula Filius Dei vocatur. Tertius
       modus est, quia a Patre ex mortuis in vitam immortalem suscitatus,
       et veluti ex utero terræ, nulla mediante matre, denuo genitus est.
       Quartus modus est, quia Jesus Christus ex morte suscitatus, hæres
       ex asse constitutus est in domo Patris sui, ac proinde bonorum
       onmium coelestium, et Patris sui ministrorum omnium sive angelorum
       dominus.: [7904]1
