PREFACE

   This volume is intended for hours of devotion, and the vast storehouse
   of sacred poetry of the Latin Church has been put under tribute to
   supply the material.

   If an apology should be required for the book, it may perhaps be enough
   to say that, while south of the Tweed Latin hymnody has had
   considerable attention paid to it, the subject has hitherto been all
   but neglected in Scotland. There may be reasons for this--we believe
   there are; but with these we have nothing to do here. The fact remains
   that, while Anglicans can point to a long list of names worthily
   associated with this department of Christian literature, including such
   well-known hymnologists as Trench, Neale, and Newman, we in Scotland
   have only two: Robert Campbell, author of the "St. Andrews Hymnal," and
   Dr. Hamilton MGill, author of "Songs of the Christian Creed and Life,"
   with the addition of Dr. Horatius Bonar, who, besides reflecting the
   spirit of the poetry of the Early Church in many of his own hymns, has
   left us also a few skilful renderings of the original. The present
   volume is, we believe, the first of its kind produced by Scotsmen and
   Presbyterians.

   In making a selection, the translator has experienced no difficulty in
   regard to the quantity and quality of material at hand; indeed, he has
   laboured under an embarrassment of riches. But the choice has been made
   from the best, and care has been taken to use only those hymns that
   might be acceptable in point of doctrine to the most fastidious.

   It has been the aim of the translator to give the idea and spirit of
   the Latin verses, and except in a very few instances absolute
   faithfulness to the original has been observed, with as much
   literalness as it is possible to give to work of this sort.

   As a rule the original measures have been retained, and only in a few
   pieces, where change seemed desirable, have different measures been
   adopted.

   For the original text, the following collections have been used:--

   Daniel, H. A. Thesaurus Hymnologicus. 5 vols. Halle and Leipzig,
          1841-56.

   Mone, F. J. Lateinische Hymnen des Mittelalters. 3 vols. Freiburg,
          1853-55.

   Wrangham, D. S. "The Liturgical Poetry of Adam St. Victor." 3 vols.
          London, 1881.

   Newman, J. H. Hymni Ecclesiæ. Oxford and London, 1865.
   Neale, J. M. Hymni Ecclesiæ. London, 1851.
   Trench, R. C. "Sacred Latin Poetry." London, 1886.

   The translator desires to give expression to his sense of indebtedness
   to Dr. MCrie, whose share in this work is by no means confined to the
   Introduction and Notes. It was at his instigation that the task was at
   first undertaken, and his help and co-operation as the work of
   rendering progressed, were ungrudgingly given.

   It will be cause for thankfulness to the translator if the work of some
   of the happiest hours of his life should meet with the appreciation and
   approbation of his fellow-countrymen, and awaken their interest in a
   department of devotional literature which has been too long neglected.

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION

   The Latin poetry of the Christian Church presents a tempting field for
   the exercise of scholarship and research. The relation in which it
   stands on the one hand to the classic poetry of Greece and Italy, and
   on the other to the Liturgies of the Eastern Church, the placing of
   accent in the room of quantity, and the rise and growth of rhyme--these
   and such-like matters will always prove attractive to experts and
   specialists. They are, however, quite beyond the scope of this brief
   paper. Those who wish to make an exhaustive study of a subject which
   has many sides and a copious literature, would do well to betake
   themselves to such standard works as are noted below. [1] The general
   reader may find something to profit and to interest him in the
   following general survey.

   The title placed on our Saviour's cross, setting forth His
   accusation--"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews," was written in
   three languages--in Hebrew and in Greek and in Latin. That collocation
   of languages gives the order in which the hymnody of the Church
   developed.

   Hebrew hymnody is contained for the most part in the Hebrew Psalter;
   for the distinction between psalms and hymns is not one that admits of
   being applied to all Hebrew poetry. Our Lord and His disciples, as they
   went out to the Mount of Olives after the institution and first
   observance of the Supper Sacrament, sang a portion of the Great Hallel,
   which consists of Psalms cxiii. to cxviii. inclusive. Their doing so is
   described in the New Testament as singing "an hymn," just as the
   singing of Paul and Silas in the Philippian prison is said to be
   singing hymns unto God. [2]

   In the Eastern or Greek Church hymnody was in both private and public
   use from earliest times. The oft-quoted letter of the younger Pliny,
   written soon after his arrival as Proconsul in the provinces of
   Bithynia and Pontus, which took place in A.D. 110, informs the Emperor
   that it was the practice of the Christians to meet together on a
   certain day and sing antiphonally (secum invicem) a hymn to Christ as
   their God; while the "Apostolical Constitutions," which take us back to
   the life of the Church in the second or third centuries, enjoin the use
   of morning and evening hymns of praise for God's beneficence by Christ.
   From the ample stores of Oriental hymnology there have come into modern
   collections many of their gems, thanks to the scholarship and
   versifying skill of Dr. Neale, Keble, and Canon Bright. To the first
   named we are indebted for such well-known renderings of Greek sacred
   pieces as "Fierce was the wild billow," and, "The day is past and
   over," as also for "Art thou weary, art thou languid?" From the author
   of the "Christian Year" we have a beautiful English rendering of a
   first or second century Greek hymn, preserved by Basil, "Hail,
   gladdening Light, of His pure glory poured;" and from Canon Bright we
   have the vesper or "lamplighting hymn," with its opening invocation,
   "Light of gladness, Beam Divine."

   The Western Church came under Eastern influence in the matter of hymn
   composition in the fourth century. The first to compose hymns in Latin
   verse was Hilary of Poitiers. This theologian was banished to Phrygia
   by the Emperor Constantius, because of his defence of the Nicene Creed
   from the attacks of the Arian party. During the bishop's exile, his
   daughter, Abra, wrote to inform him that she had been sought in
   marriage, although only in her thirteenth year. This drew forth a reply
   in which the father left the decision to her own choice, indicating at
   the same time a personal preference for continued virginity. Enclosed
   in the communication were a hymnus matutinus and a hymnus vesperinus.
   The morning hymn, beginning Lucis largitor splendida, is still extant,
   and has been styled "the oldest authentic original Latin song of praise
   to Christ as God." It is, however, more than doubtful if the one for
   evening use survives; for the hymn, Ad coeli clara non sum dignus
   sidera, given in the Benedictine edition of Hilary's works, belongs to
   the sixth or seventh century, and is probably of Irish authorship.

   Another name associated with the rise of sacred Latin poetry is that of
   Ambrose, Bishop of Milan. It will ever be to the glory of this
   fourth-century Father that Augustine ascribed to him his conversion,
   and sought baptism at his hands. His illustrious convert tells, in the
   ninth book of his "Confessions," how the bishop defended the churches
   of Milan against the intrusion of Arian modes of worship, in spite of
   the efforts put forth by Justina, mother of the Emperor Valentinian, to
   obtain one of the basilicas for the use of the party she favoured.
   Alarmed by a report that he might be removed by force, the devout
   people of the city surrounded the bishop day and night, ready to die
   with him rather than allow him to be apprehended.

   He, on his part, to stimulate their zeal and sustain their courage,
   supplied them with hymns to sing in honour of the Trinity. "Then,"
   writes Augustine, "it was first instituted that, after the manner of
   the Eastern churches, hymns and psalms should be sung, lest the people
   should wax faint through the tediousness of sorrow; and from that day
   to this the custom is retained, divers (yea, almost all Thy)
   congregations throughout other parts of the world following herein."
   Well nigh a hundred hymns have at one time or another passed under the
   title Ambrosian, but the number of authenticated pieces is pitiably
   small, not exceeding four. In that small group the Te Deum laudamus, at
   one time ascribed to the Bishop of Milan, does not find a place. For,
   as in the case of the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, the Dies Iræ, and the
   Veni, Sancte Spiritus, the question who wrote the Te Deum has not
   received a final answer, if, indeed, it ever will. Of this, however, we
   may be well assured, that in the time of Jerome of the fifth century,
   hymns were in general use throughout the Western as in the Eastern
   Church. Writing to Marcellus, that most scholarly and erudite among the
   Fathers of the Latin Church assured his correspondent "You could not go
   into the field but you might hear the ploughman at his Hallelujah, the
   mower at his hymns, and the vine-dresser singing David's Psalms."

   From the days of Hilary and of Ambrose, of Augustine and of Jerome,
   onwards through the patristic period of Church history, and all down
   the medieval centuries, there never failed to be a goodly succession of
   hymn-writers. To mention these, however briefly, would necessitate a
   violation of the limits of this essay. We refrain from attempting even
   an enumeration all the more readily, because an opportunity of giving
   brief biographical notices of the more outstanding contributors to the
   treasures of sacred Latin poetry will occur in the following pages when
   specimens of their masterpieces are submitted to the reader.

   A few sentences may be added bearing upon the hymns contained in the
   service-books of the Church of Rome, and upon the relation of Latin
   hymnody to the Churches of the Reformation.

   The use of hymns for purposes of private devotion preceded their
   insertion in the liturgical books of the pre-Reformation Church. Up to
   the seventh century the Breviaries which contained the prayers to be
   offered at the canonical hours had as matter to be sung only the words
   of Scripture. But the Spanish Council which met at Toledo in A.D. 633,
   laid down the general principle, that if in the worship of the
   sanctuary prayers may be offered in the words of uninspired men, so
   also may praise be sung. From that time the Churches of Western
   Christendom inserted hymns in their service-books, some of these
   compositions being of earlier date, but the larger number being of more
   recent times and of purely local interest. As every diocese and
   religious order claimed and exercised the right to construct its own
   ritual, Missal, and Breviary, there was endless variety of contents,
   considerable alterations of old compositions, and a general
   deterioration of quality. By the time Leo X. reached St. Peter's chair
   the need for revision had become clamant. Under the direction of that
   Medicean Pope, the collection of hymns in use at Rome was recast; and
   ultimately the entire Breviary appeared in revised form, when Urban
   VIII. was Pope, in 1631. In this revised Roman Breviary, which is now
   in general use throughout the Papal communion, the hymns of earliest
   composers--say from Hilary to Gregory--are for the most part allowed to
   remain, although in some cases altered without real amendment; but in
   the case of those pieces which could not be conformed to the laws of
   correct Latinity there was an entire recasting. According to one
   authority, himself a revisionist, upwards of nine hundred alterations
   were made in the interests of metre, and the first lines of more than
   thirty hymns were altered. The Marquis of Bute executed a translation
   of the Roman Breviary in 1879, and then gave it as his deliberate
   judgment that the revisers, "with deplorable taste made a series of
   changes in the texts of the hymns which has been disastrous both to the
   literary merit and the historical interest of the poems."

   The Breviary of Paris has been subjected to revisions in the sixteenth,
   seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. The third and latest revision
   was intrusted to a commission of three ecclesiastics, one of whom
   belonged to the Jansenist party, while another was Charles Coffin, then
   Rector of the University of Paris, who did the greater part of the work
   of editing, altering, and tinkering. Under Coffin's manipulation only
   twenty-one hymns of the earlier period were retained, and the number of
   those from the pens of comparatively modern French writers was largely
   increased.

   While all conversant with the subject will readily admit that both the
   Roman and the Parisian Breviary contain some noble verses, English
   versions of which are to be found in the writings of Williams,
   Chandler, Mant, Caswall, and Newman, as also in "Hymns Ancient and
   Modern," the conviction is both general and well-founded that the
   principles and practice of liturgical revisionists have not been
   favourable to the interests of purity and simplicity in the case of
   ancient Latin hymnody.

   Coming now to the relation in which Latin hymnology stands to the
   movement and Churches of the Reformation, it is to be noted that Luther
   showed his appreciation of what was good in the Church of his childhood
   when he rendered into the language of the Fatherland sixteen old hymns,
   twelve of these being taken from the Latin and the remaining four from
   the Old German of the Middle Ages. In his Colloquia Mensalia, the
   sturdy Protestant is to be heard censuring Ambrose as a wordy poet, but
   extolling the Rex Christe Factor omnium of Pope Gregory as the best
   hymn ever written. As with Luther, so with Melancthon and Zwingli and
   their immediate followers. They published collections and translations
   of the old Latin hymns, and they continued the use of such compositions
   in their public worship to a limited extent, even after they had ceased
   to employ the Latin tongue in Church services.

   It is well known, at least to Anglican clergymen, that the Church of
   England Book of Common Prayer contains certain "Canticles," to be used
   on Sundays and week days. Thus, after the Old Testament lesson has been
   read, the rubric provides that "there shall be said or sung in English
   the hymn called Te Deum laudamus daily throughout the year." As an
   alternative to this great Creed hymn of Western Christendom there may
   be said or sung "this canticle, Benedicite, omnia opera," that is, the
   Song of the Three Children, a part of the Greek addition to the third
   chapter of Daniel, and a paraphrase or expansion of the 148th Psalm.
   Then in the Ordinal of the Church of England, which provides for "the
   ordering of Priests" and "the consecration of Bishops," there is a
   stage at which there is to be sung or said, Veni, Creator Spiritus. Of
   this hymn two English metrical versions are given in the Prayer Book of
   1662--that presently in use, an older and more diffuse rendering, and
   one more terse and spirited, the product of Bishop Cosin.

   But it may not be generally known that many of the earliest
   service-books of the Continental and Scottish Churches had hymns
   appended to the Psalms in metre, some of which were versions in the
   vernacular of old Latin compositions. The French Psalter, edited by
   Marot in 1543, had the Ave Maria along with the Decalogue, the Belief,
   and the Lord's Prayer. The Dutch Psalter of 1640 had the Te Deum, as
   well as metrical renderings of the Decalogue, the Song of Zacharias, of
   Mary, of Simeon, and of Elizabeth.

   In the case of the Church of Scotland, the first edition of the Book of
   Common Order, published in 1564, gave only the Psalms; but the
   Bassandyne edition of the same book, published eleven years afterwards,
   contained five "Spiritual Songs;" that of 1587 gave ten, while some
   subsequent reprints have no fewer than fourteen. Among these, "commonly
   used in the Kirke and private houses," will be found "The Song of
   Simeon, called Nunc Dimittis," "The Song of Blessed Marie, called
   Magnificat," and Veni, Creator. The English of the last named is taken
   from the First Prayer Book of Edward VI., published in 1549, and is the
   version of this old hymn which occurs in "The Fourme of Ordering
   Priestes," the longer and older of the two renderings already referred
   to.

   How it has fared with Latin hymns in Protestant service-books from
   Reformation times to the present day is too wide a field of inquiry to
   enter upon at the close of this brief introduction. This it is safe to
   affirm, that no hymnal with any claim to completeness will be found to
   omit such sacred and classic pieces as, "Brief life is here our
   portion," "Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire," "Jerusalem the
   golden," "Jesus! the very thought of Thee," "Jesus, Thou joy of loving
   hearts," "O come, all ye faithful," "O Jesus, King most wonderful;" and
   all these are translations or paraphrases of early Latin hymns.

   With the increase of interest in all that concerns the praise of God's
   children, which is so marked a feature of recent times, there has come
   an ever-growing appreciation of the grandeur and beauty, the spiritual
   depth and longing wistfulness that characterise the great body of Latin
   hymnology; and, as the result of this appreciation, the finest and
   sweetest products are finding a larger place in quarters from which, at
   no very far back point of time, they were altogether excluded. Of this
   we have a striking illustration in the contents of the most recent
   attempt to construct a hymnal for use in Presbyterian Churches. In the
   "Draft Hymnal," prepared by a joint-committee of the three leading
   denominations in Scotland, there are 557 hymns. Of these, five are
   confessedly translations from the Greek, and twenty-six from the Latin.
   With the Latin renderings the names of Bishop Cosin, Dryden, Sir Walter
   Scott, Caswall, Chandler, Neale, and Ray Palmer stand honourably
   associated.

   Sunday Morning

DIE, DIERUM PRINCIPE

   By Charles Coffin, born at Ardennes in 1676; Rector of the University
   of Paris, 1718; died, 1749. The most of his hymns appeared in the Paris
   Breviary of 1736. In that service-book this is the hymn for Sunday at
   Matins.

   O day, the chief of days, whose light

   Sprang from the dark embrace of night,

   On which our Lord from death's grim thrall

   Arose, True Light, to lighten all.


   Death trembling heard the mighty Lord,

   And darkness quick obeyed His word;--

   O shame on us! our tardy will

   Is slow His summons to fulfil.


   While Nature yet unconscious lies,

   Come, let us, sons of light, arise,

   And cheerful raise our matin lay

   To chase the dark of night away.


   While all the world around is still,

   Come, and with songs the temple fill,

   Taught by the saints of bygone days,

   Whose words were song, whose songs were praise.


   Loud trump of Heaven, our languor shake,

   And bid our slumbering spirits wake;

   Teach us the nobler life, and give,

   O Christ, the needed grace to live.


   O Font of love! Our steps attend;

   Those needed gifts in mercy send;

   And where Thy word is heard this day,

   Give Thou the Spirit's power, we pray.


   To Father and to Son be praise,

   To Thee, O Holy Ghost, always,

   Whose presence still the heart inspires

   With sacred light and glowing fires.

O NATA LUX DE LUMINE

   The oldest text known of this hymn is from a tenth-century MS. It is in
   the Sarum Breviary (1495), also in that of Aberdeen (1509), which is
   substantially that of Sarum, and one of the very few surviving
   service-books of the Pre-Reformation period in Scotland.

   O Light that from the light wast born,

   Redeemer of the world forlorn,

   In mercy now Thy suppliants spare,

   Our praise accept, and hear our prayer.


   Thou who didst wear our flesh below,

   To save our souls from endless woe,

   Of Thy blest Body, Lord, would we

   Efficient members ever be.


   More bright than sun Thine aspect gleamed,

   As snowdrift white Thy garments seemed,

   When on the mount Thy glory shone,

   To faithful witnesses alone.


   There did the seers of old confer

   With those who Thy disciples were;

   And Thou on both didst shed abroad

   The glory of the eternal God.


   From heaven the Father's voice was heard

   That Thee the eternal Son declared;

   And faithful hearts now love to own

   Thy glory, King of heaven, alone.


   Grant us, we pray, to walk in light,

   Clad in Thy virtues sparkling bright,

   That, upward borne by deeds of love,

   Our souls may win the bliss above.


   Loud praise to Thee our homage brings,

   Eternal God, Thou King of kings,

   Who reignest one, Thou one in three,

   From age to age eternally.

TU TRINITATIS UNITAS

   O Thou Eternal One in Three,

   Dread Ruler of the earth and sky,

   Accept the praise we yield to Thee,

   Who, waking, lift our songs on high.


   Now from the couch of rest we rise,

   While solemn night in silence reigns,

   And lift to Thee our earnest cries,

   To give Thy balm to heal our pains.


   If in the night by Satan's guile

   Our souls were lured by thought of sin;

   O bid Thy light celestial smile,

   And chase away the night within.


   Purge Thou our flesh from every stain,

   Let not dull sloth our hearts depress;

   Nor let the sense of guilt remain,

   To chill the warmth our souls possess.


   To Thee, Redeemer blest, we pray,

   That in our souls Thy light may shine;

   So we shall walk from day to day,

   Unerring in Thy way Divine.


   Grant it, O Father, in Thy love,

   Grant it, O One-begotten Son,

   Who with the Spirit reign above,

   Now, and while endless ages run.

DEUS CREATOR OMNIUM

   By St. Ambrose, born at Lyons, Arles, or Trêves in 340; consecrated
   Bishop of Milan in 374; died on Easter Eve, 397. He introduced
   antiphonal chanting into the Western Church, and laid the foundation of
   Church music, which Gregory systematised.

   Thy works, O God, Thy name extol,

   Thou Ruler of the worlds that roll;

   The day is clad in garments bright,

   And grateful sleep pervades the night,


   That weary limbs from labour free,

   By rest for toil prepared may be;

   And jaded minds awhile forget

   The anxious thoughts that pain and fret.


   Fast fades the sunlight in the west;

   Thy hand we own our day hath blessed;

   Now from the accuser's power we flee,

   And lift our prayers in song to Thee.


   O Thou hast stirred our hearts to sing,

   Hast tuned the praise our voices bring;

   From earth's vain loves our love hast won,

   Hast lured our thoughts that heavenward run.


   So, when the rayless gloom of night

   Hath quenched in dark the expiring light,

   Faith waves the ebon clouds away,

   And dark is light, and night is day.


   That sin may ne'er an entrance make,

   May slumber ne'er our souls o'ertake;

   Faith, wakeful, keeps the soul secure,

   And sleep is sweet, and deep, and pure.


   The mind from sin's enticements free,

   O let our dreams be thoughts of Thee;

   And by no envious foe oppressed,

   Vouchsafe to Thy beloved rest.

O DEUS, EGO AMO TE, NEC AMO TE, UT SALVES ME

   Attributed to Francis Xavier. Born at the Castle Xavier, near
   Pampeluna, Spain, in 1506; graduated at the Paris University, where he
   became acquainted with Ignatius Loyola; as a Jesuit missionary visited
   India, Travancore, Ceylon, Malacca, and Japan; died, when near Canton,
   in 1552. The original of this hymn is supposed to be a Spanish sonnet.
   All that can be said of the Latin version is that it is probably by
   Xavier, or by some German Jesuit, and is at least as early as 1668.

   O God, I love Thee, not alone

   Because Thou savest me,

   And those who love not in return

   Are lost eternally.


   Thou art mine own, O Christ; Thine arms

   Embraced me on the Cross;

   Thou didst endure the nails, the spear,

   The bitter shame and loss.


   O sorrows numberless were Thine,

   And all were borne for me--

   The bloody sweat, the cruel death

   Of bitter agony.


   Why, therefore, should I love Thee now,

   O Jesus, ever blest?

   Not lest in hell my soul be cast,

   Not that in heaven it rest.


   No other hope my love inspires,

   And wins my heart for Thee--

   I only love Thee, Christ, my King,

   Because Thou lovest me.

   Pelagius in the Papal Chair, 590; sent Augustine on a mission to
   Britain in 596; died in 614. He ranks among the Four Latin Doctors, and
   because of the services he rendered to the ritual of the Church, he was
   styled Magister Cæremoniarum. The Gregorian tones or chants are the
   fruit of his study of sacred music.

   O hear our earnest prayer as now

   The gloomy shades are gathering round;


   O free our souls from guilty stains,

   That we Thy favour still may know;

   And let no thought the mind possess,

   To bind the heart to earth below.


   That we may beat at heaven's fair gate,

   Where safely stored our treasure lies,

   Purge us from every filthy stain,

   Teach us all evil to despise.

AURORA JAM SPARGIT POLUM

   Placed by Duffield in a class which contains hymns formerly called
   Ambrosian, but now known to be the work of other hands. George

   Whate'er the dark of night hath bred,

   Die in the light that greets the morn!


   So when the day eternal breaks,--

   That day for which our spirits long,--

   Its light may fall to bless our souls,

   E'en while we raise our morning song.

JESU, DULCIS MEMORIA

   Generally, and there seems little reason to doubt correctly, ascribed
   to Bernard of Clairvaux. Born in 1091 at his father's castle near Dijon
   in Burgundy; died, 1153. The monk of Citeaux, the first Abbot of
   Clairvaux, the Papal controversialist and the preacher of the Second
   Crusade, is better known in our day as the author of a hymn regarded by
   many as the sweetest and most Evangelical in mediæval hymnody. The poem
   from which the hymn is taken consists of nearly fifty quatrains on the
   name of Jesus, known as the Joyful Rhythm of St. Bernard. In the Roman
   Breviary three hymns are taken from the Rhythm, Jesu dulcis memoria,
   Jesu Rex Admirabilis, and Jesu decus angelicum.

   O Jesus, when I think of Thee,

   True gladness fills my heart;

   But joy unspeakable 'twill be

   To see Thee as Thou art.


   O blessed name! No note more sweet,

   No music so divine;

   Its charms the dearest fancies greet

   That with my memory twine.


   To those who come with sin confessed,

   Thy name their hope inspires;

   And every needy soul is blessed,

   And granted all desires.


   To those who seek, ah! Thou art found

   Far more than all desire--

   A living fount whose streams abound,

   A flame of heavenly fire.


   What tongue can e'er the charm express?

   What words its beauty show?

   For Thy dear name's sweet loveliness

   No heart can ever know.


   Who only taste the heavenly bread,

   They hunger for the feast;

   Who drink of Christ, the Fountainhead,

   But find their thirst increase.


   O Jesus, to my fainting heart

   When wilt Thou come to speak?

   O, when to me Thy bliss impart,

   And more than I can seek?


   O I will feed and hunger still,

   O I will drink and pine

   Till Thou my famished spirit fill

   With that blest name of Thine.

O DEUS, EGO AMO TE, NAM PRIOR TU AMASTI ME

   Credited by many to the composer of the hymn which opens with
   identically the same line, but proceeds quite differently. It is,
   however, doubtful if this is the composition of Xavier; more probably
   it is the breathing of desire on the part of some now unknown German
   Jesuit of the seventeenth century.

   May memory ne'er a thought suggest,

   That comes not forth at Thy behest;

   And may the mind no wisdom know,

   That God all wise doth not bestow.


   May nothing be desired by me,

   Save what I know is willed by Thee;

   And what of Thine I e'er attain,

   I render back to Thee again.


   Take what Thou gavest--all is Thine;

   Dispose as suits Thy will divine;

   Rule, Lover of my soul; I rest

   In Thy blest will who knowest best.


   That I may love Thee as I will,

   O let Thy love my bosom fill;

   This gift alone endureth aye--

   All else are dreams that flit away.

   Quell for us the tempter's wrath;

   Ne'er in trial's hour repining,

   Lead us in the upward path.


   May Thy rule our minds enlighten;

   Let no sin our lives defile;

   Fervent faith our spirits brighten,

   Knowing nought of fraud or guile.


   Christ, the Bread of Life bestowing,

   Faith our daily cup shall fill;

   Draughts of joy for ever flowing,

   Drink we from the Spirit's rill.

   Dark night has drawn her curtain round,

   The awakened conscience, sore oppressed

   By thought of sin all unconfessed,

   Yearns in the gloom, to cast her load

   At Thy blest feet, Redeemer, God.

   For bitter strife give calm within;

   Veil from our eyes the garish light,

   That lures the soul to darkest night.


   Pure may our inmost heart remain

   From evil thoughts and fancies vain;

   And may the curb our flesh control,

   That drags to earth the aspiring soul.


   So, when the last stray beams of light

   Shall fade before the return of night,

   Kept in the path our feet have trod,

   We shall give glory to our God.

NATO NOBIS SALVATORE

   By Adam of St. Victor. A native of either Britain or Brittany, probably
   the latter; educated at Paris; became, about 1130, a monk in the Abbey
   of St. Victor, then in the suburbs, afterwards absorbed in the city of
   Paris; there he passed the remainder of his life, and died somewhere
   between the years 1172 and 1192. In liturgical services the Gradual or
   Antiphon, sung between the Epistle and Gospel, ended on festival days
   with the word Alleluia. The final syllable of this vocable was
   prolonged in a number of musical notes called sequentia, and by the
   ninth century it became common to adapt words to these notes, which
   words are now called "sequences." Adam of St. Victor was one of the
   most voluminous composers of this kind of sacred Latin verse.

   Let us tune our hearts and voices--

   All creation wide rejoices,

   For a Saviour has been born;

   Given to man, his weakness wearing,

   Dwelling with the sad despairing,

   Light and health our life adorn.


   From the midst of Eden's gladness

   Came the dower of death and sadness,

   But the Saviour's life is ours.

   Banished now are death and sorrow;

   Life and joy from Christ we borrow,

   More dwelt in Eden's bowers.


   From the height of heaven above us,

   God looked down on earth to love us,

   And He sent His only Son.

   Now no more His face concealing,

   Bridegroom like, His grace revealing,

   Came He forth His work begun.


   Swift and strong, a giant glorious,

   O'er our death He came victorious,

   Girt with power His course to run.

   Came he forth salvation willing,

   Law and prophecy fulfilling,

   Till the task assayed is done.


   Jesus, who hast brought salvation,

   Healing balm for every nation,

   Thou our glory art and peace.

   Praise Thy glorious deeds shall mention,

   Who in humble condescension,

   Cam'st Thy servants to release.

   Zion is glad this glorious morn:

   Whose kingly reign no end shall know.


   The ox and ass that filled the stall,

   Knew that the babe was Lord of all.


   Out from the east the sages bring

   Their treasures for an offering.


   They humbly seek the lowly place,

   And worship there the King of grace:


   The Son of God, who made the earth,

   A virgin mother gave Him birth.


   No poison from the serpent stains

   The human blood that fills His veins;


   And though our flesh He meekly wears,

   No mark of sin His nature bears;


   That He might man to God restore,

   And give the grace that once He wore.


   Come while our hearts are full of mirth

   And bless the Lord of lowly birth.


   The Holy Trinity we'll praise,

   And give our thanks to God always.

HEU! QUID JACES STABULO, OMNIUM CREATOR?

   By Jean Momboir, with Johannes Mauburnus for the Latin, and John
   Mauburn for the English form of his name. Born in 1460 at Brussels; a
   Canon Regular of the Brethren of the Common Life in the Low Countries;
   died Abbot of the Cloister of Livry, not far from Paris, in 1502 or
   1503. In his large work, the "Spiritual Rose-garden," there is a rosary
   on the birth of Christ, consisting of thirteen stanzas, which commence,
   Eja, mea anima, Bethlehem eamus. The hymn beginning as above consists
   of three stanzas taken from that poem. The detached stanzas passed into
   many of the older German hymn-books, met with great favour in the early
   Reformed Churches, so long as the practice of singing Latin
   compositions survived among them, and still retain a place in some
   German hymnals in an old translation, with for opening line, Warum
   liegt im Krippelein.

   (Loquitur peccator)


   Wherefore in the lowly stall,

   O Thou great Creator,

   Dost Thou raise Thine infant call,

   Glorious Renovator?

   Where Thy purple if a King?

   Where the shouts Thy subjects bring?

   Where Thy royal castle?

   Here is want with all her train,

   Poverty proclaims her reign--

   These Thy court and vassal.


   (Jesus respondit)


   Hither, by My love impelled,

   Have I come to save thee;

   Sin has long thy nature held,

   Powerful to enslave thee.

   By My emptiness and woe,

   By the grace that I bestow,

   Do I seek to fill thee.

   By My humble, lowly birth,

   By this sacrifice on earth,

   Blessing great I will thee.


   (Laudant fideles)


   Songs of praise, ten thousand songs,

   Sing I will and laud Thee;

   For such grace my spirit longs,

   Ever to applaud Thee.

   Glory, glory let there be,

   Lover of mankind to Thee,

   In the heaven supernal.

   Let this testimony fly

   Over earth, and sea, and sky,

   Borne by songs eternal.

QUICUMQUE CHRISTUM QUÆRITIS

   This hymn for the Epiphany forms part of a larger one of very complex
   authorship, known as A solis ortûs cardine, Et usque terræ limitem.
   This portion of that Christmas hymn has by some been assigned to St.
   Ambrose, but by a majority of judges to Prudentius, "the Horace and
   Virgil of the Christians," in the estimate of the scholarly Bentley.
   Aurelius Prudentius, Clemens, or the Merciful, was born in 348,
   somewhere in the north of Spain. After filling various secular offices
   he retired, in his fifty-seventh year, into private life, and devoted
   himself to the composition of sacred verse. He died circa 413, but
   where we are not told.

   O ye who seek the Lord, come nigh,

   To heaven uplift your reverent eyes,

   The Royal Banner of our God

   Is blazoned on the midnight skies.


   Brighter than when the sun at noon

   Pours forth its radiance on the earth,

   See yonder star its glory sheds,

   And tells to man the Saviour's birth.


   O wisdom seeks the lowly stall,

   And takes the guidance of the star,

   To worship where the Incarnate lies,

   And offer gifts from lands afar:


   With incense, worships the Divine,

   With gold, a kingly tribute pays,

   And at the feet of God made Man,

   The myrrh in sweet profusion lays.


   O Bethlehem, city ever blest!

   What honour more could come to thee?

   The cradle of the Incarnate God,

   Who came to set His Israel free!


   O Jesus, to the world revealed!

   To Thee let glory ever be,

   To Father and to Holy Ghost,

   From age to age eternally.

JESU, NOSTRA REDEMPTIO

   Probably of the seventh or eighth century. Found in three MSS. of the
   eleventh century in the British Museum Library; also in the old Roman,
   Sarum, York, and Aberdeen Breviaries. Chandler's rendering of this fine
   hymn--"O Christ, our hope, our heart's desire," and which is to be
   found in most collections, is the hymn for Evensong on Ascension Day in
   that author's "Hymns of the Primitive Church."

   Thou our Redeemer art, O Christ,

   Our heart's desire, our fervent love;

   Creator of the worlds, Thou cam'st

   To wear our flesh, from heaven above.


   'Twas love that brought Thee to our aid,

   To bear the burden of our woe,

   To bow the head in shameful death,

   And life, immortal life, bestow.


   Asunder burst the bands of hell,

   The captives hailed the glorious day;

   And by Thy mighty triumph crowned,

   Thou art at God's right hand for aye.


   O may Thy mercy still abound,

   That, by the goodness of Thy grace,

   We daily o'er our sin may rise,

   And see the beauty of Thy face.


   Spring of our joy, be Thou, O Christ;

   Our great reward, hereafter be;

   And while the endless ages run,

   Our praises shall be all of Thee.

   Now let us tune our hearts to sing

   The glory of the Almighty King;

   His hand unrolled the spacious skies,

   Whose beauty lures our wondering eyes.


   There are the clouds with treasure rare,

   Slow floating in the higher air,

   Whence come the soft refreshing showers,

   To bless the springing of the flowers.


   Rich is the treasure of Thy grace,

   Prepared for us who seek Thy face;

   It falls from clouds that earthward roll,

   And penetrates the inmost soul.


   And faithful hearts that thirsting pine,

   Drink deeply of the draught divine,

   And with an heavenly impulse rise,

   To greet the sunlight in the skies.


   O happy souls that evermore

   Drink of the bliss Thou hast in store;

   May grateful love responsive flow

   To all the love Thou dost bestow.


   Now, glory to the Three in One,

   To God the Father, God the Son,

   And to the Spirit, one in Three,

   From age to age eternally.

DEUS-HOMO, REX COELORUM

   By Bishop Marbodus. Born in Anjou, 1035; successively Archdeacon of
   Angers and Bishop of Rennes; died in 1125. Was author of a poem De
   Gemmis, which gives a mystical explanation of precious stones much in
   favour in the Middle Ages.

   King of heaven, our nature wearing,

   Pity lend the sad despairing;

   'Neath the sway of sin repining,

   Formed from dust, to dust declining--

   Tottering in our ruined state,

   Strengthen by Thy goodness great.


   What is man from sin descending?

   Child of death, all woes attending.

   What is man? a worm that clingeth

   To the earth from which he springeth.

   Wilt Thou forth Thine anger bring,

   On a weak, defenceless thing?


   Shall not man, who earthward tendeth,

   Look to God, who mercy sendeth?

   'Twere a task most unbefitting,

   God o'er man in judgment sitting--

   Yet should God in judgment speak,

   Where shall man an answer seek?


   As the shadow quickly flying,

   Faint our life and sure our dying;

   As the cloud by tempest driven,

   As the grass cut down at even;--

   King of heaven, in mercy great,

   Pity the disconsolate.

VEXILLA REGIS PRODEUNT

   By Venantius Fortunatus. Born in the district of Treviso, Italy, about
   530. In 565 he made a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Martin at Tours,
   and spent the remainder of his years in Gaul. Through the influence of
   his friend Queen Rhadegunda, Fortunatus became Bishop of Poitiers in
   597. Some place his death in the year 609. Fortunatus must have been an
   author of great industry and versatility. He wrote the life of St.
   Martin in four books, containing 2245 hexameter lines; he threw off in
   profusion vers de societé when wandering from castle to cloister in
   Gaul; and he composed a volume of hymns for all the festivals of the
   Christian year, which is now unhappily lost. This is his best known
   hymn, Dr. Neale's translation of which is inserted for the Fifth Sunday
   in Lent, otherwise called Palm Sunday, in "Hymns Ancient and Modern"
   (No. 84).

   See the Royal banners

   Wave across the sky,

   Bright the mystic radiance,

   For the Cross is nigh;

   And He who came our flesh to wear,

   The Christ of God, was wounded there.


   Deep the cruel spear thrust,

   By the soldier given;

   Blood and water mingle,

   Where the flesh is riven;

   To cleanse our souls the crimson tide

   Leapt from the Saviour's riven side.


   In the distant ages

   Zion's harp was strung,

   And the faithful saw Him,

   While the prophet sung;

   Now Israel's Hope the nations see,

   For Christ is reigning from the tree.


   Tree of wondrous beauty,

   Tree of grace and light,

   Royal throne to rest on,

   Decked with purple bright;

   The choice of God, this royal throne

   Whence Christ, the King, should rule His own.


   See the branches drooping!

   Laden, see they sway!

   For the price of heaven

   On those branches lay;

   Ah! great the price, that price was paid,

   By Him on whom the debt was laid.

PANGE, LINGUA, GLORIOSI, PROELIUM CERTAMINIS

   This, "one of the first of the Latin mediæval hymns," has been credited
   to St. Hilary. It has also been ascribed to Claudianus Mamertus, who
   died in 474. But by the majority of authorities it is regarded as the
   composition of Fortunatus, and ranks next to the Vexilla Regis prodeunt
   in their estimate. A rendering of it by Keble will be found in his
   "Miscellaneous Poems," beginning, "Sing, my tongue, of glorious
   warfare," which is Dr. Neale's "Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle,"
   in a somewhat altered form.

   Tell, my tongue, the glorious conflict,

   Crowned with victory nobly won;--

   More than all the spoil of battle,

   Praise the triumph of God's Son;

   How by death the crown of conquest

   Graced Him when the strife was done.


   Grieving sore o'er Eden's sorrow

   When our race in Adam fell;

   And the fatal fruit he tasted,

   Welcomed sin, and death, and hell;

   God ordained a tree in Zion,

   Eden's poison to dispel.


   In the work of our Redemption

   Wisdom met the tempter's foils;--

   On the ground he claimed, the Victor

   Fought, and bore away the spoils;

   And the bane became the blessing,

   Freedom sprang amid his toils.


   From the bosom of the Father,

   Where He shared the regal crown,

   At the time by God appointed,

   Came the world's Creator down--

   God incarnate, born of Virgin,

   Shorn of glory and renown.


   List! the voice of infant weeping,

   Cradled where the oxen stand,

   And the Virgin mother watches,

   Tending Him with loving hand,--

   Hands and feet of God she bindeth,

   Folding them in swaddling band.


   Blessing, blessing everlasting,

   To the glorious Trinity;

   To the Father, Son, and Spirit,

   Equal glory let there be;

   Universal praise be given,

   To the Blessed One in Three.

LUSTRA SEX QUI JAM PEREGIT

   By some attributed to St. Ambrose, but generally and with greater

   the Passion hymns in "Hymns Ancient and Modern" (No. 99).

   Thirty years by God appointed,

   And there dawns the woeful day,

   When the great Redeemer girds Him

   For the tumult of the fray;

   And upon the cross uplifted,

   Bears our load of guilt away.


   Ah! 'tis bitter gall He drinketh,

   When His heart in anguish fails;--

   From the thorns His life-blood trickles,

   From the spear wound and the nails;

   But that crimson stream for cleansing,

   O'er creation wide prevails.


   Faithful Cross! in all the woodland,

   Standeth not a nobler tree;

   In thy leaf, and flower, and fruitage,

   None can e'er thy equal be;

   Sweet the wood, and sweet the iron,

   Sweet the load that hung on thee.


   Noble tree! unbend thy branches,

   Let thy stubborn fibres bend,

   Cast thy native rigour from thee,

   Be a gentle, loving friend;

   Bear Him in thine arms, and softly,

   Christ, the King eternal, tend.


   Only thou could'st bear the burden

   Of the ransom of our race;

   Only thou could'st be a refuge,

   Like the ark, a hiding-place,

   By the sacred blood anointed,

   Of the Covenant of Grace.


   Blessing, blessing everlasting,

   To the glorious Trinity;

   To the Father, Son, and Spirit,

   Equal glory let there be;

   Universal praise be given,

   To the Blessed One in Three.

   Hail, thou Blessed Cross, all hail!

   O! most sacred wood, the sign

   That eternal life is mine;

MORTIS PORTIS FRACTIS

   By Peter of St. Maurice, sometimes styled Peter of Cluny, but best
   known as Peter the Venerable. Born in Auvergne, 1092 or 1094; began
   life as a soldier; afterwards became a Benedictine monk; elected abbot
   of the monastery of his order at Cluny in Burgundy; died there in 1156
   or 1157. The greater part of his literary activity was given to the
   controversy between the Clugnian and Cistercian, or "black" and "white"
   monks. This Resurrection hymn is taken from "Some Rhythms, Proses,
   Sequences, Verses, and Hymns," contained in the Bibliotheca
   Cluniacencis, 1623.

   Burst are the iron gates of death--

   A stronger power prevails;

   For, by the cross, the cruel king

   Before the Victor quails,

   O clear the light that shines afar,

   Where darkness held its sway,

   For God, who made the light at first,

   Restores its gladdening ray.


   That sinners might for ever live,

   The great Creator dies,

   And by His death to new estate

   Our souls enraptured rise.

   There, Satan groaned in baffled hate,

   Where Christ our triumph won--

   For what to Him was deathly loss,

   To man was life begun.


   He grasps the envied prize, but fails,

   And while he wounds, he dies;

   But calmly, and with mighty power,

   The King secures the prize;

   And, leaving earth, His triumph won,

   He seeks His native skies.


   And now triumphant o'er the grave,

   The Lord to earth returns;

   To new create our fallen race,

   His soul with ardour burns;

   Down to the dwellings of the lost,

   To dwell with man He came;

   And hearts in grievous bondage held,

   Receive Him with acclaim.

   Ascending to the throne of God,

   Beyond the glittering host of heaven,

   To Thee, victorious King, is given.


   Three kingdoms bow before Thee now--

   The heavens above, the earth below,

   Hell's dark abode--and to their Lord,

   On bended knee, submission show.


   All awe inspired, the angel host

   Behold man's changed estate, amazed;

   Our sinful flesh, by flesh renewed,

   And man, true God, to Godhead raised.


   O Christ, with God who dwell'st on high,

   Be Thou to us, we humbly pray,

   A lasting joy while here we wait,

   Our great reward in heaven for aye.


   In earnest prayer we come to Thee;

   O may our sins be all forgiven,

   And lift our hearts by Thy rich grace,

   To where Thou art Thyself, in heaven.


   That when in clouds of Judgment dire,

   Thou com'st with Thine angelic host,

   We may escape the avenger's power,

   And wear anew the crowns we lost.

   Appeared in the Cluniac Breviary of 1686, and in that of Paris, 1736,
   as also in later French Breviaries. From his connection with the
   revised Paris Breviary, this hymn has been ascribed to Archbishop
   Charles de Vintimille, born 1655, died 1746; but in neither the Cluniac
   nor Paris Breviary is it marked as his. Chandler's version of the hymn,
   beginning, "O Jesu, who art gone before, To Thy blest realms of light,"

   That earthly mind can never know,

   Nor faithless soul perceive.


   There, where Thou art, they reap reward

   Who toiled at duty's call;

   For Thou dost give Thyself to them,

   And Thou art all in all.


   By power divine, O let us come

   Where glory cannot fade;

   And from Thy heavenly throne send down

   The Spirit to our aid.


   To Thee who art at God's right hand,

   O Christ, to Thee be praise,

   To Father, and to Holy Ghost,

   Be glory given always.

VENI, CREATOR SPIRITUS,
MENTES TUORUM VISITA

   Of the authorship of this grand hymn nothing unquestioned is known. It
   has been ascribed to Ambrose, Gregory, Rhabanus Maurus (died 856), and
   Charlemagne. The most widely prevalent opinion ascribes it to the
   last-named person, but in the judgment of Dr. Julian's assistant-editor
   "the hymn is clearly not the work of St. Ambrose nor of Charles the
   Great. Nor is there sufficient evidence to allow us to ascribe it
   either to Gregory the Great, to Rhabanus Maurus, or to any of the
   ecclesiastics connected with the court of Charles the Fat." The hymn
   has not yet been found in any MS. earlier than the latter part of the
   tenth century.

   Come, Thou Creator Spirit blest,

   And with Thy grace our minds pervade;

   May Thy sweet presence ever dwell

   Within the souls which Thou hast made.


   Thou Holy Paraclete! the Gift

   Sent down to earth from God Most High,

   Thou Font of Life and fire and love,

   Thy holy unction now apply.


   Sevenfold Thy gifts to us are given,

   Of God's right hand the Finger Thou;

   The promise of the Father's grace,

   With gifts of tongues, Thou dost endow.


   Make our dull sense enraptured glow,

   And let our hearts o'erflow with love;

   The weakness of our flesh inspire

   With heavenly valour from above.


   Far from our souls the foe repel,

   And let us know the bliss of peace;

   Guide Thou our steps, that evermore

   Our hearts may learn from sin to cease.


   Lead us the Father's love to know;

   Reveal to us the Eternal Son;

   And Thee, the Sent of both, we'll praise,

   While everlasting ages run.

VENI, SANCTE SPIRITUS ET EMITTE COELITUS

   A sequence universally regarded as one of the masterpieces of sacred
   Latin poetry. As in the case of the Veni, Creator Spiritus, the
   authorship is matter of dispute. Robert II. of France, Hermannus
   Contractus (born 1013, died 1054), Stephen Langton the Archbishop of
   Canterbury, Pope Innocent III.--these have all in turn been credited
   with its production. Dr. Julian, the greatest living authority, sums up
   the matter of authorship thus: "The sequence is clearly not earlier
   than about the beginning of the thirteenth century. It is certainly
   neither by Robert II. nor by Hermannus Contractus. The most probable
   author is Innocent III."

   Holy Spirit, come with power;

   Let Thy light, in darkest hour,

   Shine upon our onward way.

   Father of the humble heart,

   Come, Thy choicest gifts impart--

   Light our hearts with heavenly ray.


   Thou canst best the heart console;

   Sweet Thy sojourn with the soul--

   Cooling breath at noon of day,

   Calm Thy rest in toil and care,

   Soft Thy shade in noontide glare--

   Thou dost chase our tears away.


   O! Thou blessed Light of light!

   Let Thy beams in radiance bright

   Fill our inmost heart for aye.

   If Thou come not with Thy grace,

   Nought of worth can take Thy place,

   Nought but leads the soul astray.


   What is filthy, come, renew;

   What is parched, with grace bedew;

   Heal the wounded in the way.

   What is stubborn, gently bend;

   To the chilled the life-glow send;

   Bring the erring 'neath Thy sway.


   To the faithful who repose

   In the love Thy grace bestows,

   Be Thy sevenfold gift alway--

   Rich reward for service given,

   Hope in death and joy in heaven,

   Joy untold that lasteth aye.

   Christian soldiers in the conflict!

   Bear the banner of the cross;

   Rich reward shall crown the victor,

   More than recompense for loss.


   Not with paltry palms that wither

   Shall the brow be gaily crowned,

   But with light that shines eternal,

   And with heavenly joy renowned.


   Yours are mansions fair and comely--

   There your souls in bliss shall rest;

   Stars shall sparkle in their radiance,

   On the pathway of the blest.


   Earthly joys are faint and fleeting,

   Earthly favours quickly fade;

   Heavenwards lift your eyes, expecting

   There your true reward is laid.


   God be praised who crowns the victor,

   Christ be praised who saves from sin;

   Equal praise to God the Spirit,

   By whose aid we fight and win.

   See, sweet soul, my sister dear,

   Now the bridegroom neareth;

   Haste, prepare a place for Him

   Who in love appeareth.


   Soon He comes, a gentle guest,

   Comes with heart o'erflowing;

   All the best that heaven affords

   In His love bestowing.


   Where His gracious presence is

   There is joy unending;

   Blessing with His friendship comes,

   Every bliss transcending.


   Yea, He comes to rest awhile,

   Thee with love entwining;

   At thy board He'll take His place,

   By thy side reclining.


   Up, my soul, to meet thy Spouse;

   Hark! His footfall sounding;

   In thy bosom He will dwell

   With His love abounding.


   Hold Him fast in fond embrace;

   Say thou'lt leave Him never,

   Till the blessing of His love

   Rest on thee for ever.

   O Font of love surprising,

   From Jesu's heart uprising!

   A pure refreshing flow;

   Nought else our thirst allayeth--

   For this the pilgrim prayeth--

   This draught of love bestow.


   Thy face we come revering,

   Jesu, delight of every heart,

   Abide with us, O Lord, we pray,

   And cause Thy heavenly light to glow;

   Drive from our minds the clouds away,

   And let the world Thy sweetness know.


   When Thou dost seek the humble heart,

   Thy heavenly truth is freely given;

   Then vanities of earth depart,

   Then glows the fervent love of heaven.


   O Jesus, of Thy wondrous grace,

   Make us Thy boundless love to know;

   And when we see Thee face to face,

   To us Thy matchless glory show.


   They know how sweet the Lord can be,

   Who deeply drink His love divine;

   How blest, who find their all in Thee,

   Nor thirst for other joys than Thine.


   O Thou the spring whence pity flows!

   Light from the Fatherland to cheer!

   To us Thy glorious light disclose,

   Nor let dark clouds afflict us here.

VERBUM SUPERNUM PRODIENS

   By St. Thomas of Aquino, the Angelical Doctor. Born about 1225-1227;
   educated in the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino, and at the
   University of Naples. Having resolved to become a Dominican friar, St.
   Thomas, after much opposition from his family, took the vows of
   obedience, celibacy, and poverty at Naples, in 1243. The remainder of
   his life was spent in the service of the Church at Paris, Cologne,
   Rome, Naples, Bologna. When on his way to attend the Second Council of
   Lyons, he died in the Benedictine abbey of Fossa Nuova, in the diocese
   of Terracina, in 1274. This hymn was written about 1263 for the office
   for use on Corpus Christi. It is found in the Roman, Mozarabic, York,
   Sarum, Aberdeen, Paris, and other Breviaries, its primary use being at
   Lauds in Corpus Christi.

   The Word, proceeding from above,

   Yet still at God's right hand in heaven,

   Came to His work impelled by love,

   And soon life's day declined to even.


   A traitor in His chosen band

   Betrays his Lord to death and grave;

   But ere He died, with His own hand

   Himself as food to man He gave.


   In double form the gift was made;

   He gave them of His flesh and blood,

   That so the feast His love purveyed,

   Might prove for man sufficient food.


   By birth a friend in Him we find;

   As food He fills the festal board;

   In death the ransom of our kind;

   In heaven He is our great reward.


   O Saving Sacrifice! that made

   The gates of heaven stand open wide,

   Be Thou our strength, come to our aid,

   When foes would crush on every side.


   To Thee, Good Shepherd, who for meat

   Dost give Thy flesh to feed Thine own,

   To Father, and to Paraclete,

   Be praise through ages yet unknown.

GRAVI ME TERRORE PULSAS

   By Peter Damiani. Born at Ravenna about 988; became a "religious" of
   the order of the Monks of the Holy Cross of Fontavellano, of which
   community he subsequently became the Superior, founding in his day five
   monasteries under the same rule; was induced by Pope Stephen IX. to
   accept the position of Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia, an office he was
   allowed to resign by Pope Alexander II. in 1062. In retirement he lived
   a life of great asceticism and self-mortification. On his return
   journey from Ravenna, whither he had gone as Papal legate on a mission
   of inquiry and reform, he died of fever at Faenza, in the monastery of
   Our Lady, 1072.

   Terror grim the soul oppresses

   When the day of death is near;

   Sighs the heart, the reins are sundered,

   Quakes each part with anxious fear;

   While the mind the woe detaileth

   Of the conflict to appear.


   Spectacle all woe inspiring

   Who its terror can pourtray?

   See, the course of life is ended,

   And the sickening flesh gives way,

   For the wrestling soul in triumph

   Breaks the bands that bid her stay.


   Sense decays, and fails expression;

   Dark the world to melting eye;

   And the troubled breast in anguish,

   Gasping, breathes her burdened sigh;

   Grace of form and glow of beauty,

   From the withering body die.


   Thoughts, and words, and deeds forgotten,

   Crowd around in grim array;

   And unwilling eyes behold them,

   Be they closed or turned away;

   In the heart they seem to rankle,

   Turn he wheresoe'er he may.


   Vain the vow of new obedience--

   Time for vowing is no more;

   Vain the sorrow of repentance,

   For the day of grace is o'er;

   Conscience now the tortured sinner

   Gnaws with pangs unfelt before.


   Draughts of sweet deluding pleasure

   Give the bitter dregs at last;

   Come, unending pain and anguish,

   With the short-lived rapture past;

   Then, what once appeared so worthy,

   Is aside as worthless cast.


   Then, O Christ, Thou King victorious,

   Come with succour in my plight;

   When the soul is freed from bondage,

   In its hour of darkest night;

   Come, O Christ, Thy help extending,

   Free me from the accuser's might.


   Headlong may the Prince of Darkness

   With the hosts infernal fall!

   Thou, the Shepherd of Salvation,

   Bid me follow at Thy call,

   To the land where fulness dwelleth,

   And those eyes shall see it all.

APPROPINQUAT ENIM DIES IN QUA JUSTES ERIT QUIES

   Lo, the day, the day approacheth

   When the just shall rest in peace,

   When the patient souls shall triumph,

   And the vile from troubling cease.


   Day of life, who can abide it?

   Day of light, unseen before;

   Death, the fell destroyer, dieth,

   Night and darkness are no more.


   See He comes whom ages longed for--

   Long expected King of kings--

   Now He tarries not, and with Him

   All His great salvation brings.


   O how blessed! O how joyful!

   O what sweetness it shall be!

   When the eyes of those who loved Him

   Shall their Lord and Master see.


   Jesus then with sweet affection,

   And in tones of tenderest love,

   Shall invite His faithful people

   To the joys prepared above.


   "Ye who held My truth unsullied,

   Faithful stood in world of sin,

   Suffered for the name ye honoured,

   See the joys ye sought to win.


   "See the heavenly kingdom promised,

   Long reserved, but now revealed;

   Now behold it, now possess it,

   Now the princely sceptre wield."


   O how sweet our earthly losses,

   In the midst of gain like this!

   O how vain the world's possessions,

   At the cost of so much bliss!


   O how blessèd then the mourners,

   Who for Christ earth's sorrow bore,

   By a scornful world neglected!

   They shall reign for evermore.


   Now no terror grim shall haunt them--

   Tears and sorrows are no more;

   Grinding want shall ne'er afflict them,

   Crippled age nor weakness sore.


   Peace eternal there abideth,

   Hearts with festive gladness bound;

   There is youth with perfect vigour,

   And with bloom unfading crowned.


   O just Judge! in boundless mercy

   Call me heavenward by-and-by,

   For my soul is faint with longing,

   And I wait with tearful eye.

JERUSALEM LUMINOSA VERÆ PACIS VISIO

   The second in a group of three hymns, of all which the author is quite
   unknown. First published by Mone from a fifteenth century MS., at
   Karlsruhe. This hymn has for title in the original, De Gloriâ Coelestis
   Jerusalem quoad dotes Glorificati Corporis--"Of the Glory of the
   Heavenly Jerusalem, so far as concerns the endowments of the Glorified
   Body," and was a favourite at dedications and other festivals. All the

   O city girt with glory!

   Thou scene of quiet rest,

   Where dwells the King Eternal--

   O beautiful and blest!

   Thy streets are filled with glorious song,

   The praises of a myriad throng.


   With stones of polished beauty

   Is reared thy structure fair;

   And gems, and gold, and crystal

   Are sparkling everywhere;

   With pearls thy gates are glittering gay,

   And golden is thy bright highway.


   For ever and in sweetness

   Are Alleluias given;

   Unending is the feast day,

   The royal feast of heaven;

   Whate'er within thy walls is stored,

   Is pure and holy to the Lord.


   No clouds with sombre curtain

   Thy glorious brightness screen;

   There shines the Sun Eternal,

   And aye at noonday seen;

   There is no night to give repose,

   For no one toil or trouble knows.


   The vernal glow of springtime

   Is bright and lasting there,

   The wealth of summer's richness

   Is scattered everywhere;

   And that fair realm can never know

   The autumn's blast or winter's snow.


   The notes that fall in sweetness,

   Where birds in woodland sing;

   The sounds of softest music,

   That winds in summer bring,

   Are wafted o'er that city bright,

   In strains of unalloyed delight.


   There youth adorned with vigour

   Ne'er into age declines;

   No aged fears the mortal,

   Nor for the past repines;

   For past and future are unknown:

   The present reigns in heaven alone.


   No fleshly law can triumph,

   And over reason ride;

   With bodies pure and stainless

   The spirit shall abide;

   And power of flesh, and power of will,

   Shall both one common law fulfil.


   O bright the heavenly glory,

   This fragile frame shall wear,

   When health, and strength, and freedom

   Shall crown with beauty rare;

   And pleasure's draughts no sorrow know,

   But everlasting joys bestow.


   Now gladly bear the burden;

   With zeal thy task maintain,

   And gifts shall crown thy labour,

   And all thy loss be gain,

   When decked with splendour thou shalt be,

   Where glory dwells eternally.

URBS BEATA HIERUSALEM

   The author of this fine old rugged hymn is unknown. It is conjectured
   to be of sixth- or seventh-century date. It passed into many mediæval

   largely used for the dedication of churches.

   O vision bright of heavenly peace,

   Jerusalem on high,

   With living stones Thy walls are built,

   All beauteous to the eye;

   A high-born bride, the angels stand

   Around Thee, an attendant band.


   From heaven she cometh down prepared

   Her nuptial hour to grace;

   With jewels decked she shall be led

   To see her Bridegroom's face.

   O fair her streets, her bulwarks fair,

   For purest gold is everywhere.


   Her gates, adorned with glowing pearl,

   Stand open day and night,

   And hither come the faithful souls,

   And enter in His right,

   For whom they bore the cruel shame,

   That earth has linked to His dear name.


   All precious stones and shapely all,

   By sore affliction made;

   Each in its place the Heavenly King

   With His own hand has laid--

   Such was the plan, that with the Elect

   The walls of Zion should be decked.

   Most firm the sure foundation stands,

   And strong the corner-stone,

   To bear the walls that proudly rise,

   And bind them into one;

   And Zion all her trust will lay

   Upon the strength of Christ alway.


   Within that city, God beloved,

   Flow streams of praise along;

   And towers and bulwarks echo forth

   The gladness of the song;

   'Tis praise to God continually,

   The Three in One, the One in Three.


   Within Thine earthly temple, Lord,

   We meet to seek Thy face;

   O in Thy loving kindness, hear,

   Diffuse Thy heavenly grace;

   Grant, as Thy people humbly bow,

   Thine ample benediction now.


   Be found of all who seek Thee here,

   And every need supply--

   The joys of heaven that cheer the soul,

   When streams of earth are dry;

   And in the greatness of Thy love,

   Hereafter, open heaven above.

   [100]For us the cruel cross He bare 82
   [101]From the Father's throne descending 27

   G
   [102]Gone are the shades of night 23

   H
   [103]Hail, thou blessed cross, all hail! 78
   [104]Hear us, O Christ, our King 125
   [105]Holy Spirit, come with power 111

   J
   [106]Jesu, delight of every heart 133

   K
   [107]King of heaven, our nature wearing 65

   L
   [108]Let us tune our hearts and voices 49
   [109]Lo, the day, the day approacheth 143

   M
   [110]Maker of the world, we pray 22
   [111]My heart goes forth in love to Thee 20

   N
   [112]Now daylight floods the morning sky 15
   [113]Now let us tune our hearts to sing 63
   [114]Now sinks the fiery orb of day 38
   [115]Now sinks the glowing orb of day 25

   O
   [116]O Christ, who art ascended now 104
   [117]O Christ, who in that hour of dread 81
   [118]O city girt with glory 149
   [119]O day, the chief of days, whose light 3
   [120]O Food for pilgrims pining 131
   [121]O God, I love Thee, not alone 11
   [122]O Holy Father, gracious Thou and tender 118
   [123]O Holy Spirit, font of love 114
   [124]O Jesus, when I think of Thee 17
   [125]O Light that from the light wast born 5
   [126]O spotless King, who shared its gloom 83
   [127]O Thou Eternal One in Three 7
   [128]O Thou Eternal One in Three 117
   [129]O vision bright of heavenly peace 153
   [130]O ye who seek the Lord, come nigh 57

   S
   [131]See in the east the morn arise 36
   [132]See, sweet soul, my sister dear 129
   [133]See the royal banners 69
   [134]Shout praises, ye heavens 89

   T
   [135]Tell, my tongue, the glorious conflict 72
   [136]Terror grim the soul oppresses 139
   [137]The din of battle now is dead 87
   [138]The Word, proceeding from above 135
   [139]Thirty years by God appointed 75
   [140]Thou, blest Creator of the light 13
   [141]Thou our Redeemer art, O Christ 61
   [142]Thou who hast led our steps this day 30
   [143]Thy blessed passion, Christ, be ours 82
   [144]Thy works, O God, Thy name extol 9
   [145]To-day the lingering clouds are riven 102
   [146]To Thee, O Christ, our prayers shall rise 41

   V
   [147]Veiled was the glory of Thy face 80

   W
   [148]When evening shades around us close 43
   [149]Wherefore in the lowly stall 54

   Z
   [150]Zion is glad this glorious morn 52
