SERMON CXLIV.

  THE GOODNESS OF GOD.

   The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his
   works.--Psal. cxlv. 9.

   IN the handling of this argument, I proposed to do these four things:

   First, To consider what is the proper notion of goodness, as it is
   attributed to God.

   Secondly, To shew that this perfection belongs to God.

   Thirdly, To consider the effects of the Divine goodness, together with
   the large extent of it, in respect of its objects. And,

   Fourthly, To answer some objections which may seem to contradict, and
   bring in question, the goodness of God.

   I have considered the two first; and in speaking to the third, I
   proposed the considering these two things:

   I. The universal extent of God's goodness to all his creatures.

   II. More especially the goodness of God to man, which we are more
   especially concerned to take notice of, and be affected with.

   The first of these appears in these four particulars:

   1. In his giving being to so many creatures.

   2. In making them all so very good; considering the number and variety,
   the rank and order, the end and design of all of them.

   3. In his continual preservation of them.

   4. In his providing so abundantly for the welfare and happiness of all
   of them, so far as they are capable and sensible of it.

   The first of these I spoke largely to; I proceed to shew, in the

   2. Second place, That the universal goodness of God appears in making
   all these creatures so very good, considering the number and variety,
   the rank and order, the end and design of all of them. His goodness
   excited and set a-work his power to make this world, and all the
   creatures in it; and, that they might be made in the best manner that
   could be, his wisdom directed his power; he hath made all things in
   number, weight, and measure; so that they are admirably fitted and
   proportioned to one another: and that there is an excellent contrivance
   in all sorts of beings, and a wonderful beauty and harmony in the whole
   frame of things, is, I think, sufficiently visible to every discerning
   and unprejudiced mind. The lowest form of creatures, I mean those which
   are destitute of sense, do all of them contribute, some way or other,
   to the use, and conveniency, and comfort, of the creatures above them,
   which being endowed with sense, are capable of enjoying the benefit and
   delight of them, which being so palpable in the greatest part of them,
   may reasonably be presumed, though it be not so discernible, concerning
   all the rest; so that when we survey the whole creation of God, and the
   several parts, we may well cry out with David, (Psal. civ. 24.) "O
   Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all."

   It is true, indeed, there are degrees of perfection in the creatures,
   and God is not equally good to all of them. Those creatures which are
   of more noble and excellent natures, and to which he hath communicated
   more degrees of perfection, they partake more of his goodness, and are
   more glorious instances of it; but every creature partakes of the
   Divine goodness in a certain degree, and according to the nature and
   capacity of it. God, if he pleased, could have made nothing but
   immortal spirits; and he could have made as many of these as there are
   individual creatures of all sorts in the world; but it seemed good to
   the wise Architect, to make several ranks and orders of beings, and to
   display his power, and goodness, and wisdom, in all imaginable variety
   of creatures, all of which should be good in their kind, though far
   short of the perfection of angels and immortal spirits.

   He that will build a house for all the uses and purposes of which a
   house is capable, cannot make it all foundation, and great beams and
   pillars; must not so contrive it, as to make it all rooms of state and
   entertainment; but there must of necessity he in it meaner materials,
   rooms and offices for several uses and purposes, which, however
   inferior to the rest in dignity and degree, do yet contribute to the
   beauty and advantage of the whole: so, in this great frame of the
   world, it was fit there should be variety and different degrees of
   perfection in the several parts of it; and this is so far from being an
   impeachment of the wisdom or goodness of Him that made it, that it is
   an evidence of both: for the meanest of all God's creatures is good,
   considering the nature and rank of it, and the end to which it was
   designed; and we cannot imagine how it could have been ordered and
   framed better, though we can easily tell how it might have been worse,
   and that if this or that had been wanting, or had been otherwise, it
   had not been so good; and those who have been most conversant in the
   contemplation of nature, and of the works of God, have been most ready
   to make this acknowledgment.

   But then, if we consider the creatures of God with relation to one
   another, and with regard to the whole frame of things, they will all
   appear to be very good; and notwithstanding this or that kind of
   creatures be much less perfect than another, and there be a very great
   distance between the perfection of a worm, and of an angel; yet,
   considering every thing in the rank and order which it hath in the
   creation, it is as good as could be, considering its nature and use,
   and the place allotted to it among the creatures.

   And this difference in the works of God, between the goodness of the
   several parts of the creation, and the excellent and perfect goodness
   of the whole, the Scripture is very careful to express to us in the
   history of the creation, where you find God represented, as first
   looking upon and considering every day's work by itself, and approving
   it, and pronouncing it to be good; (Gen. i. 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25.) at
   the end of every day's work it is said, that "God saw it, and it was
   good:" but then, when all was finished, and he surveyed the whole
   together, it is said, (ver. 31.) that "God saw every thing that he had
   made, and behold, it was very good:" "very good," that is, the best;
   the Hebrews having no other superlative. Every creature of God, by
   itself, is good; but take the whole together, and they are "very good,"
   the best that could be.

   3. The universal goodness of God further appears in the careful and
   continual preservation of the things which he hath made; his upholding
   and maintaining the several creatures in being, in their natural state
   and order; those which have life, in life, to the period which he hath
   determined and appointed for them; in his preserving the whole world,
   his managing and governing this vast frame of things in such sort, as
   to keep it from running into confusion and disorder. This is a clear
   demonstration, no less of the goodness than of the wisdom and power of
   God, that for so many ages all the parts of it have kept their places,
   and performed the offices and work for which nature designed them; and
   that the world is not, in the course of so many thousand years, grown
   old and weak, and out of repair, and that the frame of things doth not
   dissolve and fall in pieces.

   And the goodness of God doth not only take care of the main, and
   support the whole frame of things, and preserve the more noble and
   considerable creatures, but even the least and meanest of them. The
   providence of God cloth not overlook any thing that he hath made, nor
   despise any of the works of his hands, so as to let them relapse, and
   fall back into nothing, through neglect and inadvertency; as many as
   there are, he takes care of them all, (Psal. civ. 27, 28.) where the
   Psalmist, speaking of the innumerable multitude of creatures upon the
   earth and in the sea, "These (saith he; wait all upon thee, that thou
   mayest give them their meat in due season; that thou givest them, they
   gather; thou openest thine hand, and they are filled with good." And to
   the same purpose, (Psal. cxlv. 15, 10.) "The eyes of all wait upon
   thee, and thou givest them their meat in due season; thou openest thine
   hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing." The inanimate
   creatures, which are without sense, and the brute creatures, which,
   though they have sense, are without understanding, and so can have no
   end and design of self-preservation, God preserves them, no less than
   men, who are endowed with reason and foresight to provide for
   themselves: (Psal. xxxvi. 6.) "Thou preservest man and beast." And,
   (Ps. cxlvii. 9.) "He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young
   ravens which cry." And so our Saviour declares to us the particular
   providence of God towards those creatures: (Matt. vi. 26.) "Behold the
   fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather
   into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them." (Ver. 28, 29.)
   "Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither
   do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his
   glory was not arrayed like one of these."

   And though all the creatures below man, being without understanding,
   can take no notice of this bounty of God to them, nor make any
   acknowledgments to him for it; yet man, who is the priest of the
   visible creation, and placed here in this great temple of the world, to
   offer up sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving to God, for his
   universal goodness to all his creatures, ought to bless God in their be
   half, and to sing praises to him in the name of all the inferior
   creatures, which are subjected to his dominion and use; because they
   are all, as it were, his family, his servants and utensils; and if God
   should neglect any of them, and suffer them to perish and miscarry, it
   is we that should find the inconvenience and want of them; and
   therefore we should on their behalf celebrate the praises of God; as we
   find David often does in the Psalms, calling upon the inanimate and the
   brute creatures to praise the Lord.

   4. The universal goodness of God doth yet further appear, in providing
   so abundantly for the welfare and happiness of all his creatures, so
   far as they are capable and sensible of it. He doth not only support
   and preserve his creatures in being, but takes care that they should
   all enjoy that happiness and pleasure which their natures are capable
   of. The creatures endowed with sense and reason, which only are capable
   of pleasure and happiness, God hath taken care to satisfy the several
   appetites and inclinations which he hath planted in them; and according
   as nature hath enlarged their desires and capacities, so he enlargeth
   his bounty towards them; "he openeth his hand, and satisfieth the
   desire of every living thing." God doth not immediately bring meat to
   the creatures when they are hungry; but it is near to them, commonly in
   the elements wherein they are bred, or within their reach, and he hath
   planted inclinations in them to hunt after it, and to lead and direct
   them to it, and to encourage self-preservation, and to oblige and
   instigate them to it; and that they might not be melancholy and weary
   of life, he hath so ordered the nature of living creatures, that hunger
   and thirst are most implacable desires, exceeding painful, and even in
   tolerable; and likewise, that the satisfaction of these appetites
   should be a mighty pleasure to them. And for those creatures that are
   young, and not able to provide for themselves, God hath planted in all
   creatures a storge, a natural affection towards their young ones, which
   will effectually put them upon seeking provisions for them, and
   cherishing them, with that care and tenderness which their weak and
   helpless condition doth require: and reason is not more powerful and
   effectual in mankind to this purpose, than this natural instinct is in
   brute creatures; which shews what care God hath taken, and what
   provision he hath made, in the natural frame of all his creatures, for
   the satisfaction of the inclinations and appetites which he hath
   planted in them; the satisfaction whereof is their pleasure and
   happiness. And thus I have done with the first head I proposed, the
   universal extent of God's goodness to his creatures: let us now
   proceed, in the

   II. Second place, To consider more particularly the goodness of God to
   men; which we are more especially concerned to take notice of, and to
   be affected with it. And we need go no farther than our own observation
   and experience, to prove the goodness of God; every day of our lives we
   see and taste that the Lord is good; all that we are, and all the good
   that we enjoy, and all that we expect and hope for, is from the Divine
   goodness: "every good and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
   down from the Father of lights," (Jam. i. 17.) And the best and most
   perfect of his gifts he bestows on the sons of men. What is said of the
   wisdom of God, (Prov. viii.) may be applied to his goodness; the
   goodness of God shines forth in all the works of the creation, in the
   heavens and clouds above, and in the fountains of the great deep, in
   the earth and the fields, but its delight is with the sons of men. Such
   is the goodness of God to man, that it is represented to us in
   Scripture under the notion of love: God is good to all his creatures,
   but he is only said to love the sons of men. More particularly the
   goodness of God to man appears,

   1. That he hath given us such noble and excellent beings, and placed us
   in so high a rank and order of his creatures. We owe to him that we
   are, and what we are: we do not only partake of that effect of his
   goodness which is common to us with all other creatures, that we have
   received our being from him; but we are peculiarly obliged to him for
   his more especial goodness, that he hath made us reasonable creatures
   of that kind which we should have chosen to have been of, if we could
   suppose that, before we were, it had been referred to us, and put to
   our choice, what part we would be of this visible world. But we did not
   contrive and choose this condition for ourselves, we are no ways
   accessary to the dignity and excellency of our beings: but God chose
   this condition for us, and made us what we are; so that we may say with
   David, (Psal. c. 3-5.) "It is he that hath made us, and not we
   ourselves. O enter into his gates with thanks giving, and into his
   courts with praise; be thankful unto him, and speak good of his name:
   for the Lord is good." The goodness of God is the spring and fountain
   of our beings; but for that, we had been nothing; and but for his
   farther goodness, we might have been any thing, of the lowest and
   meanest rank of his creatures. But the goodness of God hath been
   pleased to advance us to be the top and perfection of the visible
   creation; he hath been pleased to endow us with mind and understanding,
   and made us capable of happiness, in the knowledge, and love, and
   enjoyment of himself. He hath curiously and wonderfully wrought the
   frame of our bodies, so as to make them fit habitations for reasonable
   souls, and immortal spirits; he hath made our very bodies vessels of
   honour, when of the very same clay he hath made innumerable other
   creatures of a much lower rank and condition: so that though man, in
   respect of his body, be akin to the earth, yet, in regard of his soul,
   he is allied to Heaven, of a Divine original, and descended from above.
   Of all the creatures in this visible world, man is the chief; and what
   is said of behemoth, or the elephant, (Job xl.) in respect of his great
   strength, and the vast bigness of his body, is only true absolutely of
   man, that he is, Divini opificii caput; "the chief of the ways of God,
   and upon earth there is none like him."

   The Psalmist takes particular notice of the goodness of God to man, in
   this respect of the excellency and dignity of his being; (Psal. viii.
   5.) "Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast
   crowned him with glory and honour." And this advantage of our nature
   above other creatures we ought thankfully to acknowledge, though most
   men are so stupid as to overlook it; as Elihu complains, (Job xxxv. 10,
   11.) "None saith, Where is God my Maker, who teacheth us more than the
   beasts of the earth, and make thus wiser than the fowls of heaven?"

   2. The goodness of God to man appears, in that he hath made and
   ordained so many things chiefly for our use. The beauty and usefulness
   of the creatures below us, their plain subserviency to our necessity,
   and benefit, and delight, are so many clear evidences of the Divine
   goodness to us, not only (discernible to our reason, but even palpable
   to our senses, so that we may "see and taste that the Lord is
   gracious."

   This David particularly insists upon as a special ground of praise and
   thanksgiving to God, that he hath subjected so great a part of the
   creation to our dominion and use: (Psal. viii. 6-8.) speaking of man,
   "Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou
   hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the
   beasts of the field: the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and
   whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas." What an innumerable
   variety of creatures are there in this inferior world, which were
   either solely or principally made for the use and ser vice, pleasure
   and delight, of man! How many things are there, which serve for the
   necessity and support, for the contentment and comfort, of our lives!
   How many things for the refreshment and delight of our senses, and the
   exercise and employment of our understandings! That God hath not made
   man for the service of other creatures, but other creatures for the
   service of man, Epictetus doth very ingeniously argue from this
   observation; that the creatures below man, the brute beasts, have all
   things in a readiness, nature having provided for them meat, and drink,
   and lodging; so that they have no absolute need that any should build
   houses, or make clothes, or store up provision, or prepare and dress
   meat for them: "For, (says he,) being made for the service of another,
   they ought to be furnished with these things, that they may be always
   in a readiness to serve their lord and master; a plain evidence that
   they were made to serve man, and not man to serve them."

   And to raise our thoughts of God's goodness to us the sons of men yet
   higher, as he hath given us the creatures below us for our use and
   convenience, so hath he appointed the creatures above us for our guard
   and protection, not to say for our service: (Psal. xxxiv. 7.) "The
   angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
   delivereth them;" and then it follows, "O taste and see that the Lord
   is good!" And, (Psal. xci. 11, 12.) "He shall give his angels charge
   over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways: they shall bear thee up in
   their hands." Nay, the apostle speaks as if their whole business and
   employment were to attend upon, and be serviceable to, good men; (Heb.
   i. 14.) "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
   for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"

   The goodness of God to men appears in his tender love, and peculiar
   care of us above the rest of the creatures, being ready to impart, and
   dispense to us the good that is suitable to our capacity and condition,
   and concerned to exempt us from those manifold evils of want and pain,
   to which we are obnoxious: I do not mean an absolute exemption from all
   sorts and degrees of evil, and a perpetual tenure of temporal
   happiness, and enjoyment of all good things; this is not suitable to
   our present state, and the rank and order which we are in among the
   creatures; nor would it be best for us, all things considered. But the
   goodness of God to us above other creatures, is proportionable to the
   dignity and excellency of our natures above them; for, as the apostle
   reasons in another case, "Doth God take care for oxen," and shall he
   not much more extend his care to man? To this purpose our Saviour
   reasons: (Matt. vi. 26.) "Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow
   not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly
   Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?" And, (ver. 30.)
   "Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is,
   and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe
   you?" And, (chap. x. 29-31.) "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?
   and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But
   the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not, therefore,
   ye are of more value than many sparrows." It is true, God hath a
   special care of his people and servants, above the rest of mankind; but
   our Saviour useth these arguments to his disciples, to convince them of
   the providence of God towards them, as men, and of a more excellent
   nature than other creatures.

   And, indeed, we are born into the world more destitute and helpless
   than other creatures; as if it were on purpose to shew that God had
   reserved us for his more peculiar care and providence; which is so
   great, that the Scripture, by way of condescension, expresseth it to us
   by the name of love; so that what effects of care the greatest and
   tenderest affection in men is apt to produce towards one another, that,
   and much more, is the effect of God's goodness to us; and this
   affection of God is common to all men (though, of all creatures, we
   have least deserved it), and is ready to diffuse and shed abroad
   itself, wherever men are qualified for it by duty and obedience, and do
   not obstruct and stop the emanations of it, by their sins and
   provocations.

   And though the greatest part of mankind be evil, yet this doth not
   wholly put a stop to his goodness, though it cause many abatements of
   it, and hinder many good things from us; but such is the goodness of
   God, notwithstanding the evil and undutifulness of men, that he is
   pleased still to concern himself in the government of the world, and to
   preserve the societies of men from running into utter confusion and
   disorder; notwithstanding the violence and irregularities of men's
   wills and passions, the communities of men subsist upon tolerable
   terms; and notwithstanding the rage and craft of evil men, poor and
   unarmed innocence and virtue is usually protected, and sometimes
   rewarded in this world, and domineering and outrageous wickedness is
   very often remarkably checked and chastised. All which instances of
   God's providence, as they are greatly for the advantage and comfort of
   mankind, so are they an effectual declaration of that goodness which
   governs all things, and of God's kind care of the affairs and
   concernments of men; so that if we look no further than this world, we
   may say with David, "Verily, there is a reward for the righteous,
   verily there is a God that judgeth the earth."

   I know this argument hath been perverted to a quite contrary purpose:
   that if goodness governed the world, and administered the affairs of
   it, good and evil would not be so carelessly and promiscuously
   dispensed; good men would not be so great sufferers, nor wicked men so
   prosperous, as many times they are.

   But this also, if rightly considered, is an effect of God's goodness,
   and infinite patience to mankind, that "he causeth his sun to rise, and
   his rain to fall upon the just and unjust;" that, upon the provocations
   of men, he does not give over his care of them, and throw all things
   into confusion and ruin: this plainly shews, that he designs this life
   for the trial of men's virtue and obedience, in order to the greater
   reward of it; and therefore "he suffers men to walk in their own ways,"
   without any great check and control, and reserves the main bulk of
   rewards and punishments for another world: so that all this is so far
   from being any objection against the goodness of God, that, on the
   contrary, it is an argument of God's immense goodness, and infinite
   patience, that the world subsists and continues, and that he permits
   men to take their course, for the fuller trial of them, and the clearer
   and more effectual declaration, of his justice, in the rewards and
   punishments of another life.

   Fourthly, and lastly, The goodness of God to man kind most gloriously
   appears, in the provision he hath made for our eternal happiness. What
   the happiness of man should have been, had he continued in innocency,
   is not particularly revealed to us; but this is certain, that by wilful
   transgressions we have forfeited all that happiness which our natures
   are capable of. In this lapsed and ruinous condition of mankind, the
   goodness and mercy of God was pleased to employ his wisdom for our
   recovery, and to restore us not only to a new but a greater capacity of
   glory and happiness. And in order to this, the Son of God assumes our
   nature for the recovery and redemption of man; and the pardon of sin is
   purchased for us by his blood; eternal life, and the way to it, are
   clearly discovered to us. God is pleased to enter into a new and better
   covenant with us, and to afford us inward grace and assistance, to
   enable us to perform the conditions of it; and graciously to accept of
   our faith and repentance, of our sincere resolutions and endeavours of
   holiness and obedience, for perfect and complete righteousness, for His
   sake who fulfilled all righteousness.

   This is the great and amazing goodness of God to mankind, that, when we
   were in open rebellion against him, he should entertain thoughts of
   peace and reconciliation; and when he passed by the fallen angels, he
   should set his affection and love upon the sinful and miserable sons of
   men. And "herein is the love of God to men perfected," that, as he hath
   made all creatures, both above us, and below us, subservient and
   instrumental to our subsistence and preservation; so, for the ransom of
   our souls from eternal ruin and misery, "he hath not spared his own
   Son, but hath given him up to death for us;" him, whom "he hath
   commanded all the angels of God to worship," and to whom he hath made
   subject all creatures in heaven and earth: him, "who made the world,
   and who upholds all things by the word of his power, who is the
   brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person."

   And after such a stupendous instance as this, what may we not
   reasonably hope for, and promise ourselves, from the Divine goodness?
   So the apostle hath taught us to reason; (Rom. viii. 32.) "He that
   spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he
   not with him also freely give us all things?"

SERMON CXLV.

  THE GOODNESS OF GOD.

   The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his
   works.--Psalm cxlv. 9.

   IN handling this argument, I proceeded in this method;

   First, To consider what is the proper notion of goodness.

   Secondly, To shew that this perfection of goodness belongs to God.

   Thirdly, I considered the effects of the Divine goodness, under these
   heads:

   I. The universal extent of it, in the number, variety, order, end, and
   design of the things created by him, and his preservation, and
   providing for the welfare and happiness of them.

   II. I considered more particularly the goodness of God to mankind, of
   which I gave these four instances:

   1. That he hath given us such noble beings, and placed us in so high a
   rank and order of his creatures.

   2. In that he hath made and ordained so many things chiefly for us.

   3. In that he exerciseth so peculiar a providence over us above the
   rest, that though he is said to be "good to all," he is only said to
   "love the sons of men."

   4. In that he hath provided for us eternal life and happiness. There
   only now remains the

   Fourth and last particular to be spoken to, which was, To answer some
   objections which may seem to contradict and bring in question the
   goodness of God; and they are many, and have (some of them especially)
   great difficulty in them, and therefore it will require great
   consideration and care, to give a clear and satisfactory answer to
   them, which, undoubtedly, they are capable of; the goodness of God
   being one of the most certain and unquestionable truths in the world. I
   shall mention those which are most considerable and obvious, and do
   almost of themselves spring up in every man's mind; and they are these
   four: the first of them more general, the other three more particular.

   First, If God be so exceeding good, whence comes it to pass, that there
   is so much evil in the world of several kinds; evil of imperfection,
   evil of affliction or suffering, and (which is the greatest of all
   others, and indeed the cause of them) evil of sin?

   Secondly, The doctrine of absolute reprobation; by which is meant, the
   decreeing of the greatest part of mankind to eternal misery and
   torment, without any consideration or respect to their sin or fault:
   this seems notoriously to contradict, not only the notion of infinite
   goodness, but any competent measure and degree of goodness.

   Thirdly, The eternal misery and punishment of men for temporal faults
   seems hard to be reconciled with that excess of goodness which we
   suppose to be in God.

   Fourthly, The instances of God's great severity to mankind upon
   occasion in those great calamities which, by the providence of God,
   have, in several ages, either befallen mankind in general, or
   particular nations; and here I shall confine myself to Scripture
   instances, as being the most certain and remarkable, or at least equal
   to any that are to be met with in history; as, the early and universal
   degeneracy of mankind, by the sin and transgression of our first
   parents; the destruction of the world by a general deluge; the sudden
   and terrible destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about
   them, by fire and brimstone from heaven; the cruel extirpation of the
   Canaanites, by the express command of God; and lastly, the great
   calamities which befel the Jewish nation, and the final ruin and
   perdition of them at the destruction of Jerusalem.

   These are the objections against the goodness of God, which I shall
   severally consider, and, with all the brevity and clearness I can,
   endeavour to return a particular answer to them.

   The first objection, which I told you is more general, is this: if God
   be so exceeding good, whence then comes it to pass, that there is so
   much evil in the world of several kinds? It is evident, beyond denial,
   that evil abounds in the world: "The whole world lies in evil," says
   St. John, en to ponero keitai, "lies in wickedness," (so our
   translation renders it) is involved in sin; but, by the article and
   opposition, St. John seems to intend the devil: "We know (says he) that
   we are of God, and the whole world, en to ponero keitai, is subject to
   the evil one," and under his power and dominion. Which way soever we
   render it, it signifies that evil of one kind or other reigns in the
   world. Now, can evil come from a good God? "Out of the same mouth
   proceedeth blessing and cursing? Doth a fountain send forth, at the
   same place, sweet water and bitter? This cannot be," as St. James
   speaks in another case. But all evils that are in the world, must
   either be directly procured by the Divine Providence, or permitted to
   happen; and, next to the causing and procuring of evil, it seems to be
   contrary to the goodness of God to permit that there should be any such
   thing, when it is in his power to help and hinder it.

   Answer.--To give an account of this: it was an ancient doctrine of some
   of the most ancient nations, that there were two first causes or
   principles of all things, the one of good things, the other of bad;
   which, among the Persians, were called Oromasdes and Arimanius; among
   the Egyptians, Osiris and Typhon; among the Chaldeans, good or bad
   planets; among the Greeks, Zeu`s and Hades: Plutarch expressly says,
   that the good principle was called God, and the bad, Dæmon, or the
   devil; in conformity to which ancient traditions, the Manichees (a sad
   sect of Christians) set up two principles; the one infinitely good,
   which they supposed to be the original cause of all good that is in the
   world; the other infinitely evil, to which they ascribed all the evils
   that are in the world.

   But, besides that the notion of an infinite evil is a contradiction, it
   would be to no purpose to suppose two opposite principles of equal
   power and force. That the very notion of an infinite evil is a
   contradiction will be very clear, if we consider, that what is
   infinitely evil must be infinitely imperfect, and, consequently,
   infinitely weak; and, for that reason, though never so mischievous and
   malicious, yet, being infinitely weak, and ignorant, and foolish, would
   neither be in a capacity to contrive mischief, nor to execute it. But
   admit that a being infinitely mischievous were infinitely cunning, and
   infinitely powerful, yet it could do no evil; because the opposite
   principle of infinite goodness being also in finitely wise and
   powerful, they would tie up one another's hands: so that, upon this
   supposition, the notion of a Deity would signify just nothing, and by
   virtue of the eternal opposition and equality of these two principles,
   they would keep one another at a perpetual bay, and, being an equal
   match for one another, instead of being two deities, they would be two
   idols, able to do neither good nor evil.

   But to return a more distinct and satisfactory answer to this
   objection: There are three sorts of evil in the world; the evil of
   imperfection, the evil of affliction and suffering, and the evil of
   sin.

   And, first, for the evil of imperfection, I mean natural imperfections,
   these are not simply and absolutely, but only comparatively evil: now
   comparative evil is but a less degree of goodness; and it is not at all
   inconsistent with the goodness of God that some creatures should be
   less good than others; that is, imperfect in comparison of them; nay,
   it is very agreeable, both to the goodness and wisdom of God, that
   there should be this variety in the creatures, and that they should be
   of several degrees of perfection, being made for several uses and
   purposes, and to be subservient to one another, provided they all
   contribute to the harmony and beauty of the whole.

   Some imperfection is necessarily involved in the very nature and
   condition of a creature; as, that it derives its being from another,
   and necessarily depends upon it, and is beholden to it, and is likewise
   of necessity finite and limited in its nature and perfections; and as
   for those creatures which are less perfect than others, this also, that
   there should be degrees of perfection, is necessary, upon supposition,
   that the wisdom of God thinks fit to display itself in variety of
   creatures of several kinds and ranks; for though, comparing the
   creatures with one another, the angelical nature is best and most
   perfect, yet it is absolutely best that there should be other creatures
   besides angels. There are many parts of the creation which are rashly
   and inconsiderately by us concluded to be evil and imperfect, as some
   noxious and hurtful creatures, which yet, in other respects, and to
   some purposes, may be very useful, and against the harm and mischief
   whereof we are sufficiently armed, by such means of defence, and such
   antidotes, as reason and experience are able to find and furnish us
   withal; and those parts of the world which we think of little or no
   use, as rocks and deserts, and that vast wilderness of the sea, if we
   consider things well, are of great use to several very considerable
   purposes; or, if we can discern no other use of them, they serve at
   least to help our dulness, and to make us more attentively to consider
   and to admire the perfection and usefulness of the rest; at the worst
   they may serve for foils to set off the wise order and contrivance of
   other things, and (as one expresseth it very well) they may be like a
   blackmoor's head in a picture, which gives the greater beauty to the
   whole piece.

   Secondly, For the evils of affliction and suffering; and these either
   befal brute creatures, or men endowed with reason and consideration.

   1st, For those which befal the brute creatures; those sufferings which
   nature inflicts upon them are very few; the greatest they meet withal
   are from men, or upon their account, for whose sake they were chiefly
   made, and to whose reasonable use and gentle dominion they are
   consigned.

   It is necessary, from the very nature of these creatures, that they
   should be passive, and liable to pain; and yet it doth in no wise
   contradict either the wisdom or goodness of God to make such creatures,
   because all these pains are, for the most part, fully recompensed by
   the pleasure these creatures find in life; and that they have such a
   pleasure and happiness in life is evident, in that all creatures,
   notwithstanding the miseries they endure, are still fond of life, and
   unwilling to part with it: no creature but man (who only hath perverted
   his nature) ever seeks the destruction of itself; and, since all brute
   creatures are so loath to go out of being, we may probably conclude,
   that if they could deliberate whether they should be or not, they would
   choose to come into being, even upon these hard conditions.

   But, however that be, this we are sure of, that they suffer chiefly
   from us, and upon our account; we, who are their natural lords, having
   depraved ourselves first, are become cruel and tyrannical to them; nay,
   the Scripture tells us, that they suffer for our sakes, and "the whole
   creation groaneth, and is in bondage" for the sin of man. And this is
   not unreasonable, that, being made principally for man, they should
   suffer upon his account, as a part of his goods and estate, not as a
   punishment to them (which, under the notion of punishment, they are not
   capable of), but as a punishment to him who is the lord and owner of
   them, they being, by this means, become more weak and frail, and less
   useful and serviceable to him for whom they were made; so that the
   sufferings of the creatures below us are, in a great measure, to be
   charged upon us, under whose dominion God hath put them.

   2dly, As for the afflictions and sufferings which befal men, these are
   not natural, and of God's making, but the result and fruit of our own
   doings, the effects and consequences of the ill use of our own liberty,
   and free choice; and God does not willingly send them upon us, but we
   wilfully pull them down upon ourselves; for "he doth not afflict
   willingly, nor grieve the children of men," as the prophet tells us,
   (Lam. iii. 33.) Or, as it is in the Wisdom of Solomon, (chap. i. 12,
   13.) "God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction
   of the living; but men pull destruction upon themselves, with the works
   of their own hands." All the evils that are in the world, are either
   the effects of our own sin, as poverty, and disgrace, pains, diseases,
   and death, which are sometimes more immediately inflicted upon men by a
   visible providence and hand of God, but are usually brought upon us by
   ourselves, in the natural course and order of things; or they are the
   effects of other men's sins, brought upon us by the ambition and
   covetousness, by the malice and cruelty, of others: and these evils,
   though they are procured and caused by others, yet they are deserved by
   ourselves; and though they are immediately from the hand of men, yet we
   ought to look farther, and consider them as directed and disposed by
   the providence of God; as David did when Shimei cursed him; "God (saith
   he) hath bid him curse David," though it immediately proceeded from
   Shimei's insolence and ill-nature.

   Now, upon the supposition of sin, the evils of affliction and suffering
   are good, because they are of great use to us, and serve to very goods
   ends and purposes.

   1. As they are the proper punishments of sin. Evil is good to them that
   do evil; that is, it is fit and proper, just and due: (Psal. cvii. 17.)
   "Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their
   iniquities, are afflicted." And it is fit they should be so; crooked to
   crooked, is straight and right. "A rod for the back of fools," saith
   Solomon; and elsewhere, "God hath made every thing for that which is
   fit for it, and the evil day for the wicked man."

   2. As they are the preventions and remedies of greater evils. Evils of
   affliction and suffering are good for wicked men, to bring them to a
   sense of their sin, and to reclaim them from it, and thereby to prevent
   greater temporal evils, and preserve them from eternal misery; and not
   only good to the person that suffers, but likewise to others, to deter
   and affright them from the like sins; to prevent the contagion of sin,
   and to stop the progress of iniquity, upon which greater guilt and
   worse mischiefs might ensue; and they are good to good men, to awaken
   and rouse them out of their security, to make them know God and
   themselves better; they are almost a necessary discipline for the best
   of men, much more for evil and depraved dispositions; and we might as
   reasonably expect that there should be no rod in a school, as that
   there should be no suffering and afflictions in the world.

   3. As they are the occasions and matter of many virtues. God teacheth
   men temperance by want, and patience by reproach and sufferings,
   charity by persecution, and pity and compassion to others by grievous
   pains upon ourselves. The benefit of afflictions, to them that make a
   wise use of them, is unspeakable; they are grievous in themselves,
   "Nevertheless (saith the apostle to the Hebrews) they bring forth the
   peaceable fruits of righteousness, to them that are exercised
   therewith." David gives a great testimony of the mighty benefit and
   advantage of them, from his own experience; (Psal. cxix. 67.) "Before I
   was afflicted, went astray, but now have I kept thy word." And, (ver.
   71.) "It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn
   thy statutes."

   4. The evils of suffering, patiently submitted to, and decently borne,
   do greatly contribute to the increase of our happiness. All the
   persecutions and sufferings of good men in this life, "do work for us a
   far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." And if they contribute
   to our greater good and happiness at last, they are good. The glorious
   reward of the sufferings which we have met with in this life, will in
   the next clear up the goodness and justice of the Divine Providence
   from all those mists and clouds which are now upon it, and fully acquit
   it from those objections which are now raised against it, upon account
   of the afflictions and sufferings of good men in this life, which "are
   not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in
   them."

   Thirdly, As for the evil of sin, which is the great difficulty of all,
   how is it consistent with the goodness of God, to permit so great an
   evil as this to come into the world? For answer to this, I desire these
   two things may be considered:

   1. That it doth not at all contradict the wisdom or goodness of God, to
   make a creature of such a frame, as to be capable of having its
   obedience tried, in order to the reward of it; which could not be,
   unless such a creature were made mutable, and by the good or bad use of
   its liberty, capable of obeying or disobeying the laws of his Creator:
   for where there is no possibility of sinning, there can be no trial of
   our virtue and obedience; and nothing but virtue and obedience are
   capable of reward. The goodness of God towards us is sufficiently
   vindicated, in that he made us capable of happiness, and gave us
   sufficient direction and power for the attaining of that end; and it
   does in no wise contradict his goodness, that he does not, by his
   omnipotency, interpose to prevent our sin: for this had been to alter
   the nature of things, and not to let man be the creature he made him,
   capable of reward or punishment, according to the good or bad use of
   his own free choice. It is sufficient that God made man good at first,
   though mutable, and that he had a power to have continued so, though he
   wilfully determined himself to evil: this acquits the goodness of God,
   that "he made man upright," but he found out to himself many
   inventions.

   2. If there had not been such an order and rank of creatures as had
   been in their nature mutable, there had been no place for the
   manifestation of God's goodness in away of mercy and patience: so that
   though God be not the author of the sins of men, yet, in case of their
   wilful transgression and disobedience, the goodness of God hath a fair
   opportunity of discovering itself, in his patience and long-suffering
   to sinners, and in his merciful care and provision for their recovery
   out of that miserable state. And this may suffice for answer to the
   first objection if God be so good, whence then comes evil?

   The second objection against the goodness of God, is from the doctrine
   of absolute reprobation: by which I mean, the decreeing the greatest
   part of mankind to eternal misery and torment, without any
   consideration or respect to their sin and fault. This seems not only
   notoriously to contradict the notion of infinite goodness, but to be
   utterly inconsistent with the least measure and degree of goodness.
   Indeed, if by reprobation were only meant that God, in his own infinite
   knowledge, foresees the sins and wickedness of men, and hath from all
   eternity determined in himself, what in his word he hath so plainly
   declared, that he will punish impenitent sinners with everlasting
   destruction; or if by reprobation be meant, that God hath not elected
   all mankind, that is, absolutely decreed to bring them infallibly to
   salvation: neither of these notions of reprobation is any ways
   inconsistent with the goodness of God; for he may foresee the
   wickedness of men, and determine to punish it, without any impeachment
   of his goodness: he may be very good to all, and yet not equally and in
   the same degree: if God please to bring any infallibly to salvation,
   this is transcendent goodness; but if he put all others into a capacity
   of it, and use all necessary and fitting means to make them happy, and,
   after all this, any fall short of happiness through their own wilful
   fault and obstinacy; these men are evil and cruel to themselves, but
   God hath been very good and merciful to them.

   But if by reprobation be meant, either that God hath decreed, without
   respect to the sins of men, their absolute ruin and misery, or that he
   hath decreed that they shall inevitably sin and perish; it cannot be
   denied, but that such a reprobation as this doth clearly overthrow all
   possible notion of goodness. I have told you, that the true and only
   notion of goodness in God is this, that it is a propension and
   disposition of the Divine nature, to communicate being and happiness to
   his creatures: but surely, nothing can be more plainly contrary to a
   disposition to make them happy, than an absolute decree, and a
   peremptory resolution to make them miserable. God is infinitely better
   than the best of men, and yet none can possibly think that man a good
   man, who should absolutely resolve to disinherit and destroy his
   children, without the foresight and consideration of any fault to be
   committed by them. We may talk of the goodness of God; but it is not an
   easy matter to devise or say any thing worse than this of the devil.

   But it is said, reprobation is an act of sovereignty in God, and
   therefore not to be measured by the common rules of goodness. But it is
   contrary to goodness, and plainly inconsistent with it; and we must not
   attribute such a sovereignty to God, as contradicts his goodness; for
   if the sovereignty of God may break in at pleasure upon his other
   attributes, then it signifies nothing, to say that God is good, and
   wise, and just, if his sovereignty may at any time act contrary to
   these perfections.

   Now, if the doctrine of absolute reprobation, and the goodness of God,
   cannot possibly stand together, the question is, which of them ought to
   give way to the other? What St. Paul determines in another case,
   concerning the truth and fidelity of God, will equally hold concerning
   his goodness; "Let God be" good, "and every man a liar." The doctrine
   of absolute reprobation is no part of the doctrine of the Holy
   Scriptures, that ever I could find; and there is the rule of our faith.
   If some great divines have held this doctrine, not in opposition to the
   goodness of God, but hoping they might be reconciled together, let them
   do it if they can; but if they cannot, rather let the schools of the
   greatest divines be called in question, than the goodness of God,
   which, next to his being, is the greatest and clearest truth in the
   world.

   Thirdly, It is farther objected, that the eternal punishment of men,
   for temporal faults, seems hard to be reconciled with that excess of
   goodness, which we suppose to be in God.

   This objection I have fully answered, in a discourse upon St. Matthew,
   (chap. xxv. 46.) and therefore shall proceed to the

   Fourth and last objection against the goodness of God, from sundry
   instances of God's severity to mankind, in those great calamities
   which, by the providence of God, have, in several ages, either befallen
   mankind in general, or particular nations.

   And here I shall confine myself to Scripture instances, as being most
   known, and most certain and remarkable, or at least equally remarkable
   with any that are to be met with in any other history: such are the
   early and universal degeneracy of all mankind, by the sin and
   transgression of our first parents; the destruction of the world by a
   general deluge; the sudden and terrible destruction of Sodom and
   Gomorrah, and the cities about them, by fire and brimstone from heaven;
   the cruel extirpation of the Canaanites, by the express command of God:
   and, lastly, the great calamities which befel the Jewish nation,
   especially the final ruin and dispersion of them at the destruction of
   Jerusalem: these, and the like instances of God's severity, seem to
   call in question his goodness.

   Against these severe and dreadful instances of God's severity, it might
   be a sufficient vindication of his goodness, to say, in general, that
   they were all upon great and high provocations; and most of them after
   a long patience and forbearance, and with a great mixture of mercy, and
   a declared readiness in God to have prevented or removed them, upon
   repentance; all which are great instances of the goodness of God: but
   yet, for the clearer manifestation of the Divine goodness, I shall
   consider them particularly and as briefly as I can.

   1. As for the transgression of our first parents, and the dismal
   consequences of it to all their posterity: this is a great depth; and
   though the Scripture mentions it, yet it speaks but little of it; and
   in matters of mere revelation, we must not attempt "to be wise above
   what is written." Thus much is plain, that it was an act of high and
   wilful disobedience to a very plain and easy command; and that, in the
   punishment of it, God mitigated the extremity of the sentence (which
   was present death), by granting our first parents the reprieve of
   almost a thousand years: and as to the consequences of it to their
   posterity, God did not, upon this provocation, abandon his care of
   mankind; and, though he removed them out of that happy state and place
   in which man was created, yet he gave them a tolerable condition and
   accommodations upon earth: and, which is certainly the most glorious
   instance of Divine goodness that ever was, he was pleased to make the
   fall and misery of man, the happy occasion of sending his Son in our
   nature for the recovery and advancement of it to a much happier and
   better condition than that from which we fell So the apostle tells us,
   at large, (Romans v.) that "the grace of God by Jesus Christ," hath
   redounded much more to our benefit and advantage, than "the sin and
   disobedience of our first parents" did to our prejudice.

   2. For the general deluge, though it look very severe, yet, if we
   consider it well, we may plainly discern much of goodness in it; it was
   upon great provocation, by the universal corruption and depravation of
   mankind: "The earth was filled with violence, and all flesh had
   corrupted its ways; the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and
   every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually;" which is not a description of original sin, but of the
   actual and improved wickedness of mankind: and yet, when the wickedness
   of men was come to this height, God gave them fair warning, before he
   brought this calamity upon them, "when the patience of God waited in
   the days of Noah," for the space of "a hundred and twenty years;" at
   last, when nothing would reclaim them, and almost the whole race of
   mankind were become so very bad, that it is said, "it repented the Lord
   that he had made man upon the earth, and it grieved him at his heart;"
   when things were thus extremely bad, and like to continue so, God, in
   pity to man kind, and to put a stop to their growing wickedness and
   guilt, swept them away all at once from the face of the earth, except
   one family, which he had preserved from this contagion, to be a new
   seminary of mankind, and, as the heathen poet expresseth it, Mundi
   melioris origo, "The source and original of a better race."

   3. For that terrible destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire and
   brimstone from heaven, it was not brought upon them till "the cry of
   their sin was great, and gone up to heaven;" until, by their unnatural
   lusts, they had provoked supernatural vengeance. And it is very
   remarkable, to what low terms God was pleased to condescend to Abraham
   for the sparing of them; (Gen. xviii. 32.) if in those five cities
   there had been found "but ten righteous persons, he would not have
   destroyed them for those ten's sake." So that we may say with the
   apostle, "Behold the goodness and severity of God!" Here was wonderful
   goodness mixed with this great se verity.

   4. For the extirpation of the Canaanites, by the express command of
   God, which hath such an appearance of severity, it is to be considered,
   (hat this vengeance was not executed upon them, until they were grown
   ripe for it. God spared them for above four hundred years, for so long
   their growing impiety is taken notice of, (Gen. xv. 16.) where it is
   said that "the iniquity of the Amorites was not yet full:" God did not
   proceed to cut them off until their case was desperate, past all hopes
   of recovery, until "the land was defiled with abominations," and sur
   charged with wickedness to that degree, as to "spew out its
   inhabitants;" as is expressly said, Levit. xviii. 28. When they were
   arrived to this pitch, it was no mercy to them to spare them any
   longer, to heap up more guilt and misery to themselves.

   Fifthly, and lastly, As for the great calamities which God brought upon
   the Jews, especially in their final ruin and dispersion at the
   destruction of Jerusalem; not to insist upon the known history of their
   multiplied rebellions and provocations, of their despiteful usage of
   God's prophets whom he sent to warn them of his judgments, and to call
   them to repentance; of their obstinate refusal to receive correction,
   and to be brought to amendment, by any means that God could use; for
   all which provocations, he at last delivered them into their enemies
   hands, to carry them away captive: not to insist upon this, I shall
   only consider their final destruction by the Romans, which, though it
   be dreadfully severe, beyond any example of history, yet the
   provocation was proportionable; for this vengeance did not come upon
   them, until they had, as it were, extorted it, by the most obstinate
   impenitency and unbelief, in "rejecting the counsel of God against
   themselves," and resisting such means as would have brought Tyre and
   Sidon, Sodom and Gomorrah, to repentance; until they had despised the
   doctrine of life and salvation, delivered to them by the Son of God,
   and confirmed from heaven by the clearest and greatest miracles; and by
   wicked hands had crucified and slain the Son of God, and the Saviour of
   the world. Nay, even after this greatest of sins that ever was
   committed, God waited for their repentance forty years, to see if in
   that time they would be brought to a sense of their sins, and to "know
   the things which belonged to their peace." And no wonder if, after such
   provocations, and so much patience, and so obstinate an impenitency,
   the goodness of God at last gave way to his justice, and "wrath came
   upon them to the utmost."

   So that all these instances, rightly considered, are rather
   commendations of the Divine goodness, than just and reasonable
   objections against it; and notwithstanding the severity of them, it is
   evident that God is good, from the primary inclinations of his nature;
   and severe only upon necessity, and in case of just provocation. And to
   be otherwise, not to punish insolent impiety and incorrigible
   wickedness in a severe and remarkable manner, would not be goodness,
   but a fond indulgence; not patience, but stupidity; not mercy to
   mankind, but cruelty; because it would be an encouragement to them to
   do more mischief, and to bring greater misery upon themselves.

   So that if we suppose God to be holy and just, as well as good, there
   is nothing in any of these instances, but what is very consistent with
   all that goodness which we can suppose to be in a holy, and wise, and
   just Governor, who is a declared enemy to sin, and is resolved to give
   all fitting discountenance to the breach and violation of his laws. It
   is necessary, in kindness and compassion to the rest of mankind, that
   some should be made remark able instances of God's severity; that the
   punishment of a few may be a warning to all, that they may hear and
   fear, and, by avoiding the like sins, may prevent the like severity
   upon themselves.

   And now I have, as briefly as I could, explained and vindicated the
   goodness of God; the consideration whereof is fruitful of many
   excellent and useful inferences, in relation both to our comfort and
   our duty: but these I shall refer to another opportunity.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXLVI.

  THE GOODNESS OF GOD.

   The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his
   works.--Psalm cxlv. 9.

   I HAVE made several discourses upon this argument of the goodness of
   God; shewing what it is; on what accounts we ascribe it to God; what
   are the effects and large extent of it to the whole creation, and more
   particularly to mankind; and, in the last place, considered the several
   objections which seem to lie against it. I proceed now to the
   application of this excellent argument, the consideration where of is
   so fruitful of useful inferences, in relation both to our comfort and
   duty. And,

   I. This shews us the prodigious folly and unreasonableness of atheism.
   Most of the atheism that is in the world, doth not so much consist in a
   firm persuasion that there is no God, as in vain wishes and desires
   that there were none. Bad men think it would be a happiness to them,
   and that they should be in a much better condition if there were no
   God, than if there be one. Nemo deum non esse credit, nisi cui Deum non
   esse expedit; "No man is apt to disbelieve a God, but he whose interest
   it is that there should be none." And if we could see into the hearts
   of wicked men, we should find this lying at the bottom, that if there
   be a God, he is just, and will punish sin; that he is infinite in
   power, and not to be resisted, and therefore kills them with his terror
   so often as they think of him: hence they apprehend it their interest
   that there should be no God, and wish there were none, and thence are
   apt to cherish in their minds a vain hope that there is none, and at
   last endeavour to impose upon themselves by vain reasonings, and to
   suppress the belief of a God, and to stifle their natural apprehensions
   and fears of him. So that it is not Primus in orbe deos fecit timor,
   "Fear that first made gods," but the fear which bad men have of Divine
   power and justice, that first tempted them to the disbelief of him.

   But were not these men as foolish as they are wicked, they would wish
   with all their hearts there were a God, and be glad to believe so: and
   the Psalmist gives them their true character, who can entertain any
   such thoughts or wishes; (Psal. xiv. 1.) "The fool hath said in his
   heart, There is no God:" for they are fools who do not understand nor
   consult their true interest. And if this be true which I have said
   concerning the goodness of God, if this be his nature, to desire and
   procure the happiness of his creatures; whoever understands the true
   nature of God, and his own true interest, can not but wish there were a
   God, and be glad of any argument to prove it, and rejoice to find it
   true; as children are glad of a kind and tender father, and as subjects
   rejoice in a wise and good prince.

   The goodness of God gives us a lovely character of him, makes him so
   good a father, so gracious a governor of men, that if there were no
   such being in the world, it were infinitely desirable to mankind, that
   there should be: he is such an one, Qualem omnes cuperent, si deesset;
   "As, if he were wanting, all men ought to wish for." The being of God
   is so comfortable, so convenient, so necessary to the felicity of
   mankind, that (as Tully admirably says) Dii immortales ad usum hominum
   fabricati pene videantur; "If God were not a necessary being of
   himself, he might almost seem to be made on purpose for the use and
   benefit of men." So that atheism is not only an instance of the most
   horrible impiety, but of the greatest stupidity; and for men to glory
   in their disbelief of a God, is like the rejoicing and triumph of a
   furious and besotted multitude in the murder of a wise and good prince,
   the great est calamity and confusion that could possibly have befallen
   them.

   If the evidence of God's being were not so clear as it is, yet the
   consideration of his goodness ought to check all inclination to atheism
   and infidelity; for if he be as good as he is represented to us, both
   by natural light and Divine revelation (and he is so, as sure as he
   is), if he tender our welfare, and desire our happiness, as much as we
   ourselves can do, and use all wise ways and proper means to bring it
   about; then it is plainly every man's interest, even thine, O sinner!
   to whom, after all thy provocations, he is willing to be reconciled,
   that there should be such a being as God is; and whenever thou comest
   to thyself, thou wilt be sensible of thy want of him, and thy soul will
   "thirst for God, even the living God, and pant after him as the hart
   pants after the water-brooks;" in the day of thy affliction and
   calamity, "when distress and anguish cometh upon thee," thou wilt flee
   to God for refuge, and shelter thyself under his protection, and
   wouldest not, for all the world, but there were such a being in it to
   help and deliver thee. Deos nemo sanus timet (says Seneca); furor est
   metuere salutaria; "No man in his wits is afraid there is a God: it is
   a madness to fear that which is so much for our benefit and advantage."
   Human nature is conscious to itself of its own weakness and
   insufficiency, and of its necessary dependance upon something without
   itself for its happiness; and therefore, in great extremity and
   distress, the atheist himself hath naturally recourse to him; and he
   who denied and rejected him in his prosperity, clings to him in
   adversity, as his only support and present help in time of trouble. And
   this is a sure indication, that these men, after all their endeavours
   to impose upon themselves, have not been able wholly to extinguish in
   their minds the belief of God, and his goodness; nay, it is a sign, at
   the bottom of their hearts, they have a firm persuasion of his
   goodness, when, after all their insolent defiance of him, they have the
   confidence to apply to him for mercy and help, "in time of need:" and
   therefore, our hearts ought to rise with indignation against those who
   go about to persuade the belief of a thing so prejudicial to our
   interest, to take away "the light of our eyes, and the breath of our
   nostrils," and to rob us of all the comfort and support which the
   belief of an infinite power, conducted by infinite wisdom and goodness,
   is apt to afford to mankind.

   II. We should take great care of preventing and abusing this great
   goodness, by vain confidence and presumption. This is a provocation of
   a high nature, which the Scripture calls, "turning the grace of God
   into wantonness;" making that an encouragement to sin, which is one of
   the strongest arguments in the world against it. God is infinitely good
   and merciful: but we must not, therefore, think that he is fond and
   indulgent to our faults; but, on the contrary, because he is good, he
   cannot but hate evil. So the Scripture every where tells us, that "He
   is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity;" that "the face of the Lord
   is against them that do evil: he is not a God that hath pleasure in
   wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with him: the foolish shall not
   stand in his sight; he hateth all the workers of iniquity." He is ready
   to shew mercy to those who are qualified for it by repentance, and
   resolution of a better course: but as long as we continue impenitent,
   God is implacable, and will deal with us according to the tenor of his
   laws, and the desert of our doings. Despair is a great sin, but
   presumption is a greater: despair doubts of the goodness of God, but
   presumption abuseth it; despair disbelieves, but presumption perverts
   the best thing in the world to a quite contrary purpose from what it
   was intended.

   III. The consideration of God's goodness, is a mighty comfort and
   relief to our minds, under all our fears and troubles. Great are the
   fears and jealousies of many devout minds concerning God's love to
   them, and their everlasting condition; which are commonly founded in
   one of these two causes, a melancholy temper, or mistaken notions and
   apprehensions of God; and very often these two meet together, and
   hinder the cure and removal of one another.

   Melancholy, as it is an effect of bodily temper, is a disease not to be
   cured by reason and argument, but by physic and time: but the mistakes
   which men have entertained concerning God, if they be not set on and
   heightened by melancholy (as many times they are), may be rectified by
   a true representation of the goodness of God, confirmed by reason and
   Scripture. Many good men have had very hard and injurious thoughts of
   God instilled into them, from doctrines too commonly taught and
   received; as if he did not sincerely desire the happiness of his
   creatures, but had, from all eternity, decreed to make the greatest
   part of mankind, with a secret purpose and design, to make them
   miserable; and, consequently, were not serious and in a good earnest in
   his invitations and exhortations of sinners to repentance; and it is no
   wonder if such jealousies as these concerning God, make men doubtful
   whether God love them, and very scrupulous and anxious about their
   everlasting condition.

   I have already told you, that these harsh doctrines have no manner of
   foundation, either in reason or Scripture; that God earnestly desires
   our happiness, and affords us sufficient means to that end; that he
   bears a more hearty good-will to us, than any man does to his friend,
   or any father upon earth ever did to his dearest child; in comparison
   of which, the greatest affection of men to those whom they love best,
   is "but as the drop of the bucket, as the very small dust upon the
   balance." If we have right apprehensions of God's goodness, we can have
   no temptation to despair of his kind and merciful intentions to us,
   provided we be but careful of our duty to him, and do sincerely repent
   and forsake our sins. Plainer declarations no words can make, than
   those we meet with in the Holy Scriptures, that "God hath no pleasure
   in the death of the wicked, but rather that he should turn from his
   wickedness and live;" that "he would have all men to be saved, and to
   come to the knowledge of the truth;" that "he is long-suffering to
   us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come
   to repentance;" that "he that confesseth and forsaketh his sin, shall
   have mercy:" that "if the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous
   man his thoughts, and return unto the Lord, he will have mercy, and
   will abundantly pardon."

   As for outward calamities and afflictions, the consideration of God's
   goodness is a firm ground of consolation to us, giving us assurance,
   that God will either prevent them by his providence, or support us
   under them, or rescue us out of them, or turn them to our greater good
   and happiness in this world, or the next. St. Paul speaks of it as the
   firm belief and persuasion of all good men, that, in the issue, all
   their actions should prove to their advantage: "We know (says he) that
   all things shall work together for good to them that love God." And one
   of the greatest evidences of our love to God, is a firm belief and
   persuasion of his goodness: if we believe his goodness, we cannot but
   love him; and if we love him, "all things shall work together for our
   good."

   And this is a great cordial to those who are under grievous
   persecutions and sufferings, [1] which is the case of our brethren in a
   neighbouring nation, and may come to be ours, God knows how soon. But
   though the malice of men be great, and backed with a power not to be
   controlled by any visible means, and therefore likely to continue; yet
   the goodness of God is greater than the malice of men, and of a longer
   duration and continuance. And thus David comforted himself when he was
   persecuted by Saul; (Psal. lii. 1.) "Why boastest thou thyself in
   mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually." The
   persecution which Saul raised against him was very powerful, and lasted
   a long time; but he comforts himself with this, that "the goodness of
   God endures for ever."

   IV. The consideration of God's goodness, is a powerful motive and
   argument to several duties.

   1. To the love of God. And this is the most proper and natural effect
   and operation of the goodness of God upon our minds. Several of the
   Divine attributes are very awful, but goodness is amiable; and, without
   this, nothing else is so. Power and wisdom may command dread and
   admiration; but nothing but goodness can challenge our love and
   affection. Goodness is amiable for itself, though no benefit and
   advantage should from thence redound to us: but when we find the
   comfortable effects of it, when "the riches of God's goodness, and
   long-suffering, and forbearance" are laid out upon us, when we live
   upon that goodness, and are indebted to it for all that we have and
   hope for; this is a much greater endearment to us of that excellency
   and perfection, which was amiable for itself. We cannot but love him
   who is good, and does us good; whose goodness extends to all his
   creatures, but is exercised in so peculiar a manner towards the sons of
   men, that it is called love; and if God vouchsafe to love us, well may
   this be "the first and great commandment, Thou shall love the Lord thy
   God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
   mind."

   2. The consideration of God's goodness is likewise an argument for us
   to fear him; not as a slave does his master, but as a child does his
   father, who the more he loves him, the more afraid he is to offend him.
   "There is forgiveness with thee, (saith the Psalmist) that thou rnayest
   be feared:" because God is ready to forgive, we should be afraid to
   offend. "Men shall fear the Lord, and his goodness," saith the prophet.
   (Hosea iii. 5.) And, in deed, nothing is more to be dreaded than
   despised goodness, and abused patience, which turns into fury and
   vengeance: "Despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and
   long-suffering, and forbearance, (says the apostle) and treasurest up
   to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the
   righteous judgment of God?"

   3. The consideration of God's goodness, is a powerful motive to
   obedience to his laws, and (as the apostle expresseth it) "to walk
   worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleasing, being fruitful in every good
   work." This argument Samuel useth to the people of Israel, to persuade
   them to obedience; (1 Sam. xii. 24.) "Only fear the Lord, and serve him
   in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath
   done for you."

   And, indeed, the laws which God hath given us, are none of the least
   instances of his goodness to us, since they all tend to our good, and
   are proper causes and means of our happiness: so that, in challenging
   our obedience to his laws, as acknowledgments of our obligation to him
   for his benefits, he lays a new obligation, and confers a greater
   benefit upon us. All that his laws require of us, is to do that which
   is best for ourselves, and does most directly conduce to our own
   welfare and happiness. Considering our infinite obligations to God, he
   might have challenged our obedience to the severest and harshest laws
   he could have imposed upon us: so that as the servants said to Naaman,
   "Had the prophet bid thee to do some great thing, wouldst thou not have
   done it? how much more when he hath only said, Wash, and be clean?" If
   God had required of us things very grievous and burthensome, in love
   and gratitude to him, we ought to have yielded a ready and cheerful
   obedience to such commands; how much more when he hath only said, Do
   this, and be happy. In testimony of your love to me, do these things
   which are the great est kindness and benefit to yourselves.

   4. The goodness of God should lead men to repentance. One of the
   greatest aggravations of our sins is, that we offend against so much
   goodness, and make so bad a requital for it; "Do ye thus requite the
   Lord, O foolish people and unwise!" The proper tendency of God's
   goodness and patience to sinners, is to bring them to a sense of their
   miscarriage, and to a resolution of a better course. When we reflect
   upon the blessings and favours of God, and his continual goodness to
   us, can we choose but be ashamed of our terrible ingratitude and
   disobedience? Nothing is more apt to make an ingenuous nature to
   relent, than the sense of undeserved kindness; that God should be so
   good to us, who are evil and unthankful to him; that though we be
   enemies to him, yet, when we hunger, he feeds us; when we thirst, he
   gives us to drink; heaping, as it were, coals of fire on our heads, on
   purpose to melt us into repentance, and to over come our evil by his
   goodness.

   5. The consideration of God's goodness is a firm ground of trust and
   confidence. What may we not hope and assuredly expect from immense and
   boundless goodness? If we have right apprehensions of the goodness of
   God, we cannot possibly distrust him, or doubt of the performance of
   those gracious promises which he hath made to us; the same goodness
   which inclined him to make such promises, will effectually engage him
   to make them good. If God be so good as he hath declared himself, why
   should we think that he will not help us in our need, and relieve us in
   our distress, and comfort us in our afflictions and sorrows? If we may
   with confidence rely upon any thing to confer good upon us, and to
   preserve and deliver us from evil, we may trust infinite goodness.

   6. The goodness of God is likewise an argument to us to patience and
   contentedness with every condition. If the hand of God be severe and
   heavy upon us in any affliction, we may be assured that it is not
   without great cause that so much goodness is so highly offended and
   displeased with us; that he designs our good in all the evils he sends
   us, and does not chasten us for his pleasure, but for our profit; that
   we are the cause of our own sufferings, and our sins separate between
   God and us, and withhold good things from us; that in the final issue
   and result of things, "all things shall work together for good" to us;
   and therefore we ought not to be discontented at any thing which will
   certainly end in our happiness.

   7. Let us imitate the goodness of God. The highest perfection of the
   best and most perfect Being is worthy to be our pattern: this Scripture
   frequently proposeth to us; (Matt. v. 48.) "Be ye therefore perfect,
   even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." How is that? In
   being good, and kind, and merciful, as God is: "But I say unto you,
   (says our Lord) love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good
   to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you,
   and persecute you; that you may be the children of your Father which is
   in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil, and on the good,
   and sendeth rain on the just, and on the unjust:" and then it follows,
   "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
   perfect." The same pat tern St. Paul proposeth to us; (Ephes. iv. 32.;
   and chap. v. 1.) "Be ye kind one to another, tender hearted; forgiving
   one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you. Be ye
   therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love." We
   cannot in any thing resemble God more than in goodness, and kindness,
   and mercy, and in a readiness to forgive those who have been injurious
   to us, and to be reconciled to them.

   Let us then often contemplate this perfection of God, and represent it
   to our minds, that, by the frequent contemplation of it, we may be
   transformed into the image of the Divine goodness. Is God so good to
   his creatures? with how much greater reason should we be so to our
   fellow-creatures? Is God good to us? Let us imitate his universal
   goodness, by endeavouring the good of mankind; and, as much as in us
   lies, of the whole creation of God. What God is to us, and what we
   would have him still be to us, that let us be to others. We are in
   finitely beholden to this perfection of God for all that we are, and
   for all that we enjoy, and for all that we expect; and therefore we
   have all the reason in the world to admire and imitate it. Let this
   pattern of the Divine goodness be continually before us, that we may be
   still fashioning ourselves in the temper of our minds, and in the
   actions of our lives, to a likeness and conformity to it.

   Lastly, The consideration of the Divine goodness should excite our
   praise and thankfulness: this is a great duty, to the performance
   whereof we should summon all the powers and faculties of our souls: as
   the holy Psalmist does; (Psal. ciii. 1, 2.) "Bless the Lord, O my soul,
   and all that is within me bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my
   soul, and forget not all his benefits." And we should invite all others
   to the same work, as the same devout Psalmist frequently does; (Psal.
   cvi. 1.) "O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy
   endureth for ever." And (Psal. cvii. 8.) "Oh that men would praise the
   Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of
   men."

   And we had need to be often called upon to this duty, to which we have
   a peculiar backwardness. Necessity drives us to prayer, and sends us to
   God for the supply of our wants; but. praise and thanks giving is a
   duty which depends upon our gratitude and ingenuity; and nothing sooner
   wears off, than the sense of kindness and benefits. We are very apt to
   forget the blessings of God, not so much from a bad memory, as from a
   bad nature; to for get the greatest blessings, the continuance whereof
   should continually put us in mind of them, the blessings of our beings.
   So God complains of his people; (Deut. xxxii. 18.) "Of the God that
   formed thee thou hast been unmindful:" the dignity and excellency of
   our being above all the creatures of this visible world; (Job xxxv. 10,
   11.) "None saith, Where is God my Maker, who teacheth us more than the
   beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven;" the
   daily comforts and blessings of our lives, which we can continually
   receive, without almost ever looking up to the hand that gives them. So
   God complains by the prophet Hosea; (chap. ii. 8.) "She knew not that I
   gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold."
   And is it not shameful to see how, at the most plentiful tables, the
   giving of God thanks is almost grown out of fashion? as if men were
   ashamed to own from whence these blessings came. When thanks is all God
   expects from us, can we not afford to give him that? "Do ye thus
   requite the Lord, foolish people and unwise?" It is just with God to
   take away his blessings from us, if we deny him this easy tribute of
   praise and thanksgiving.

   It is a sign men are unfit for heaven, when they are backward to that
   which is the proper work and employment of the blessed spirits above:
   therefore, as ever we hope to come thither, let us begin this work
   here, and inure ourselves to that which will be the great business of
   all eternity: let us, with the four-and-twenty elders in the
   Revelation, "fall down before him that sits on the throne, and worship
   him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast our crowns before the
   throne," (that is, cast ourselves) and ascribe all glory to God,
   saying, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and
   power; for thou hast made all things, and for thy pleasure they are,
   and were created."

   To him, therefore, the infinite and inexhaustible fountain of goodness,
   the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation, who gave us such
   excellent beings, having made us little lower than the angels, and
   crowned us with glory and honour; who hath been pleased to stamp upon
   us the image of his own goodness, and thereby made us partakers of a
   Divine nature, communicating to us not only of the effects of his
   goodness, but, in some measure and degree, of the perfection itself; to
   Him, who gives us all things richly to enjoy which pertain to life and
   godliness, and hath made such abundant provision not only for our
   comfort and convenience in this present life, but for our unspeakable
   happiness to all eternity; to Him who designed this happiness to us
   from all eternity, and whose mercy and goodness to us endures for ever;
   who, when by wilful transgressions and disobedience we had plunged
   ourselves into a state of sin and misery, and had forfeited that
   happiness which we were designed to, was pleased to restore us to a new
   capacity of it, by sending his only Son to take our nature, with the
   miseries and infirmities of it, to live among us, and to die for us: in
   a word, to Him who is infinitely good to us, not only contrary to our
   deserts, but beyond our hopes; who renews his mercy upon us every
   morning, and is patient, though we provoke him every day; who preserves
   and provides for us, and spares us continually; who is always willing,
   always watchful, and never weary to do us good: to Him be all glory and
   honour, adoration and praise, love and obedience, now and for ever.

SERMON CXLVII.

  THE MERCY OF GOD.

   The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy.--Numb. xiv. 18.

   I HAVE considered God's goodness in general. There are two eminent
   branches of it his patience and mercy. The patience of God is his
   goodness to them that are guilty in deferring or moderating their
   deserved punishment: the mercy of God is his goodness to them that are
   or may be miserable. It is the last of these two I design to discourse
   of at this time; in doing of which I shall inquire,

   First, What we are to understand by the mercy of God.

   Secondly, Shew you that this perfection belongs to God.

   Thirdly, Consider the degree of it, that God is of great mercy.

   First, What we are to understand by the mercy of God.

   I told you, it is his goodness to them that are in misery, or liable to
   it; that is, that are in danger of it, or have deserved it. It is mercy
   to prevent the misery that we are liable to, and which may befal us,
   though it be not actually upon us. It is mercy to defer the misery that
   we deserve, or mitigate it; and this is, properly, patience and
   forbearance. It is mercy to relieve those that are in misery, to
   support or comfort them. It is mercy to remit the misery we deserve,
   and, by pardon and forgiveness, to remove and take away the obligation
   to punishment.

   Thus the mercy of God is usually, in Scripture, set forth to us by the
   affection of pity and compassion; which is an affection that causeth a
   sensible commotion and disturbance in us, upon the apprehension of some
   great evil that lies upon another, or hangs over him. Hence it is that
   God is said, in Scripture, to be grieved and afflicted for the miseries
   of men; his bowels are said to sound, and his heart to turn within him.
   But though God is pleased in this manner to set forth his mercy and
   tenderness towards us, yet we must take heed how we clothe the Divine
   nature with the infirmities of human passions. We must not measure the
   perfection of God by the expressions of his condescension; and, because
   he stoops to our weakness, level him to our infirmities. When God is
   said to pity us, we must take away the imperfection of his passion, the
   commotion and disturbance of it, and not imagine any such thing in God;
   but we are to conceive, that the mercy and compassion of God, without
   producing the disquiet, do produce the effects of the most sensible
   pity.

   Secondly, That this perfection belongs to God.

   All the arguments that I used to prove the goodness of God, from the
   acknowledgment of natural light, and from Scripture and reason, serve
   to prove that he is merciful; because the mercy of God is an eminent
   branch of his goodness. I will only produce some of those many texts of
   Scripture which attribute this perfection to God. (Exod. xxxiv. 6.)
   "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious." (Deut. iv. 31.) "The
   Lord thy God is a merciful God." (2 Chron. xxxiv. 9.) "The Lord your
   God is gracious and merciful." (Nehem. ix. 17.) "Ready to pardon,
   gracious and merciful." (Psal. xxv. 10.) "All the paths of the Lord are
   mercy." (Psal. lxii. 12.) "Unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy." (Psal.
   ciii. 8.) "Merciful and gracious." (Psal. cxxx. 7.) "With the Lord
   there is mercy." And so (Jer. iii. 12. Joel ii. 13. Jonah iv. 2. Luke
   vi. 36.) "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."
   The Scripture speaks of this as most natural to him. 2 Cor. i. 3, he is
   called "the Father of mercies." But when he punisheth, he doth, as it
   were, relinquish his nature, and do a "strange work." "The Lord will
   wait, that he may be gracious." (Isa. xxx. 18.) God passeth by
   opportunities of punishing, but his mercy takes opportunity to display
   itself: "He waits to be gracious." To afflict or punish is a work that
   God is unwilling to do, that he takes no pleasure in; (Lam. iii. 33.)
   "He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men." But
   mercy is a work that he delights in; (Micah vii. 18.) "He delighteth in
   mercy." When God shews mercy, he does it with pleasure and delight; he
   is said to rejoice over his people, to do them good. Those attributes
   that declare God's goodness, as when he is said to be gracious or
   merciful, and long-suffering, they shew what God is in himself, and
   delights to be: those which declare his wrath and severity, shew what
   he is upon provocation, and the occasion of sin; not what he chooseth
   to be, but what we do, as it were, compel and necessitate him to be.

   Thirdly, For the degree of it; That God is a God of great mercy.

   The Scripture doth delight to advance the mercy of God, and does use
   great variety of expression to magnify it: it speaks of the greatness
   of his mercy; (Numb. xiv. 19.) "According unto the greatness of thy
   mercy." (2 Sam. xxiv. 14.) "Let me fall into the hands of the Lord, for
   his mercies are great." It is called an abundant mercy; (1 Pet. i. 3.)
   "According to his abundant mercy." (Psal. ciii. 8.) He is said to be
   "plenteous in mercy;" and "rich in mercy," (Eph. ii. 4.) Psal. v. 6. he
   speaks of the multitude of God's mercies; and of the variety of them.
   (Nehem. ix. 19.) "In thy manifold mercies thou forsakest them not." So
   many are they, that we are said to be surrounded and compassed about on
   every side with them. (Psal. ciii. 4.) "Who crowneth thee with
   loving-kindness and tender mercies."

   And yet further to set forth the greatness of them, the Scripture useth
   all dimensions. Height; (Psal. lvii. 10.) "Thy mercy is great unto the
   heavens." Nay, higher yet; (Psal. cviii. 4.) "Thy mercy is great above
   the heavens." For the latitude and extent of it, it is as large as the
   earth, and extends to all the creatures; (Psal. cxix. 64.) "The earth,
   O Lord, is full of thy mercy." (Psal. cxlv. 9.) "His tender mercies are
   over all his works." For the length, or duration and continuance of it;
   (Exod. xxxiv. 7.) "Laying up mercy in store for thousands of
   generations," one after another. Nay, it is of a longer continuance:
   Psal. cxviii. it is several times repeated, that "his mercy endureth
   for ever."

   And to shew the intense degree of this affection of mercy, or pity, the
   Scripture useth several emphatical expressions to set it forth to us.
   The Scripture speaks of the tender mercies of God; (Psal. xxv. 6.)
   "Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies." Yea, of the multitude of these;
   (Psal. li. 1.) "According unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot
   out my transgressions." (Jam. v. 11.) "The Lord is very pitiful, and of
   tender mercy." They are called God's bowels, which are the tenderest
   parts, and apt to yearn and stir in us when any affections of love and
   pity are excited; (Isa. lxiii. 15.) "Where is the sounding of thy
   bowels, and of thy mercies towards me? are they restrained?" (Luke i.
   78.) "Through the tender mercy of our God;" so it is in our
   translation: but, if we render it from the original, it is, "through
   the bowels of the mercies of our God." How doth God condescend, in
   those pathetical expressions, which he useth concerning his people?
   (Hos. xi. 8.) "How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver
   thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as
   Zeboim? mine heart is turned with in me, and my repentings are kindled
   together." Nay, to express his tender sense of our miseries and
   sufferings, he is represented as being afflicted with us, and bearing
   apart in our sufferings; (Isa. lxiii. 9.) "In all their afflictions he
   was afflicted."

   The compassions of God are compared to the tenderest affections among
   men: to that of a father towards his children; (Psal. ciii. 13.) "Like
   as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear
   him." Nay, to the compassions of a mother towards her infant; (Isa.
   xlix. 15.) "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not
   have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, she may," it is possible,
   though most unlikely: but though a mother may turn unnatural, yet God
   can not be unmerciful.

   In short, the Scripture doth every where magnify the mercy of God, and
   speak of it with all possible advantage; as if the Divine nature, which
   doth in all perfections excel all others, did in this excel itself. The
   Scripture speaks of it as if God was wholly taken up with it, as if it
   was his constant exercise and employment, so that, in comparison of it,
   he doth hardly display any other excellency; (Psal. xxv. 10.) "All the
   paths of the Lord are mercy:" as if, in this world, God had a design to
   advance his mercy above his other attributes. The mercy of God is now
   in the throne; this is the day of mercy; and God doth display it, many
   times, with a seeming dishonour to his other attributes, his justice,
   and holiness, and truth. His justice; this makes Job complain of the
   long life and prosperity of the wicked; (Job xxi. 7.) "Wherefore do the
   wicked live, yea, become old?" &c. His holiness; this makes the prophet
   expostulate with God, (Habak. i. 13.) "Thou art of purer eyes than to
   behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou
   upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue?" &c. And the
   truth of God; this makes Jonah complain, as if God's mercies were such
   as did make some reflection upon his truth. (Jonah iv. 2.)

   But that we may have more distinct apprehensions of the greatness and
   number of God's mercies, I will distribute them into kinds, and rank
   them under several heads. It is mercy, to prevent those evils and
   miseries that we are liable to: it is mercy, to defer those evils that
   we have deserved, or to mitigate them: it is mercy, to support and
   comfort us when misery is upon us; it is mercy, to deliver us from
   them: but the greatest mercy of all is, to remit the evil and misery we
   have deserved, by pardon and forgiveness, to remove and take away the
   obligation to punishment. So that the mercy of God may be reduced to
   these five heads:

   I. Preventing mercy. Many evils and miseries which we are liable to,
   God prevents them at a great distance; and when they are coming towards
   us, he stops them, or turns them another way. The merciful providence
   of God, and those invisible guards which protect us, do divert many
   evils from us, which fall upon others. We seldom take notice of God's
   preventing mercy; we are not apt to be sensible how great a mercy it is
   to be freed from those straits and necessities, those pains and
   diseases of body, those inward racks and horrors which others are
   pressed withal, and labour under. When any evil or misery is upon us,
   would we not reckon it a mercy to be rescued and delivered from it? And
   is it not a greater mercy that we never felt it? Does not that man owe
   more to his physician, who prevents his sickness and distemper, than he
   who, after the weakness and languishing, the pains and tortures of
   several months, is at length cured by him?

   II. Forbearing mercy. And this is the patience of God, which consists
   in the deferring or mode rating of our deserved punishment. Hence it
   is, that "slow to anger," and "of great mercy," do so often go
   together. But this I shall speak to hereafter in some particular
   discourses.

   III. Comforting mercy. (2 Cor. i. 3.) "The Father of mercies, and the
   God of all comfort." The Scripture represents God as very merciful, in
   comforting and supporting those that are afflicted and cast down: hence
   are those expressions of" put ting his arms under us; bearing us up;
   speaking comfortably; visiting us with his loving-kindness:" which
   signify God's merciful regard to those who are in misery and distress.

   IV. His relieving mercy, in supplying those that are in want, and
   delivering those that are in trouble. God doth, many times, exercise
   men with trouble and afflictions, with a very gracious and merciful
   design, to prevent greater evils, which men would otherwise bring upon
   themselves. Afflictions are a merciful invention of heaven to do us
   that good, which nothing else can; they awaken us to a sense of God,
   and of ourselves, to a consideration of the evil of our ways; they make
   us to take notice of God, to seek him, and inquire after him. God doth,
   as it were, by afflictions, throw men upon their backs, to make them
   look up to heaven. (Hos. v. 15.) "In their affliction they will seek me
   early." (Psal. lxxviii. 34.) "When he slew them, then they sought him,
   and they returned and inquired early after God." But God does not
   delight in this; "he "doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the
   children of men." When afflictions have accomplished their work, and
   obtained their end upon us, God is very ready to remove them, and
   command deliverance for us; (Isa. liv. 7, 8.) "For a small moment have
   I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little
   wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting
   kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord, thy redeemer."

   V. Pardoning mercy. And here the greatness and fulness of God's mercy
   appears, because our sins are great: (Psal. lxxviii. 38.) "Being full
   of compassion, he forgave their iniquity." And the multitude of God's
   mercies because our sins are many; (Psal. li. 1.) "Have mercy upon me,
   O God, according to thy loving-kindness; according unto the multitude
   of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions." (Exod. xxxiv. 7.) He
   is said "to pardon iniquity, transgression, and sin." How manifold are
   his mercies, to forgive all our sins, of what kind soever! The mercy of
   God to us in pardoning our sins, is matter of astonishment and
   admiration; (Mic. vii. 18.) "Who is a God like unto thee, that
   pardoneth iniquity!" But especially, if we consider by what means our
   pardon is procured; by transferring our guilt upon the most innocent
   person, the Son of God, and making him to bear our iniquities, and to
   suffer the wrath of God which was due to us. The admirable contrivance
   of God's mercy appears in this dispensation; this shews the riches of
   his grace, that he should be at so much cost to purchase our pardon;
   "Not with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious
   blood of his own Son." (Eph. i. 6, 7.) "To the praise of the glory of
   his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved; in whom we
   have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according
   to the riches of his grace."

   Having dispatched the three particulars I proposed to be spoken to, I
   shall shew what use we ought to make of this Divine attribute.

   Use 1. We ought with thankfulness to acknowledge and admire the great
   mercy of God to us. Let us view it in all its dimensions; the height,
   and length, and breadth of it: in all the variety and kinds of it; the
   preventing mercy of God to many of us. Those miseries that lie upon
   others, it is mercy to us that we escaped them. It is mercy that spares
   us: "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, and because
   his compassions fail not." It is mercy that mitigates our punishment,
   and makes it fall below the desert of our sins. It is mercy that
   comforts and supports us under any of those evils that lie upon us, and
   that rescues and delivers us from them; which way soever we look, we
   are encompassed with the mercies of God; they "compass us about on
   every side; we are crowned with loving-kindness, and tender mercies."
   It is mercy that feeds us, and clothes us, and that preserves us. But,
   above all, we should thankfully acknowledge and admire the pardoning
   mercy of God; (Psal. ciii. 1, 2, 3.) where David does, as it were,
   muster up the mercies of God, and make a catalogue of them; he sets the
   pardoning mercy in the front; "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that
   is within me bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget
   not all his benefits; who forgiveth all thy iniquities."

   If we look into ourselves, and consider our own temper and disposition,
   how void of pity and bowels we are, how cruel, and hard-hearted, and
   insolent, and revengeful; if we look abroad into the world, and see how
   "full the earth is of the habitations of cruelty," we shall admire the
   mercy of God more, and think ourselves more beholden to it. How many
   things must concur to make our hearts tender, and melt our spirits, and
   stir our bowels, to make us pitiful and compassionate? We seldom pity
   any, unless they be actually in misery; nor all such neither, unless
   the misery they lie under be very great; nor then neither, unless the
   person that suffers be nearly related, and we be some ways concerned in
   his sufferings; yea, many times not then neither upon a generous
   account, but as we are some ways obliged by interest and self-love, and
   a dear regard to ourselves, when we have suffered the like ourselves,
   and have learned to pity others by our own sufferings, or when in
   danger or probability to be in the like condition ourselves; so many
   motives and obligations are necessary to awaken and stir up this
   affection in us. But God is merciful and pitiful to us out of the mere
   goodness of his nature; for few of these motives and considerations can
   have any place in him. This affection of pity and tenderness is stirred
   up in God by the mere presence of the object, without any other
   inducement. The mercy of God, many times, doth not stay till we be
   actually miserable, but looks forward a great way, and pities us at a
   great distance, and prevents our misery. God doth not only pity us in
   great calamities, but considers those lesser evils that are upon us.
   God is merciful to us, when we have deserved all the evils that are
   upon us; and far greater, when we are less than the least of all his
   mercies, when we deserved all the misery that is upon us, and have with
   violent hands pulled it upon our own heads, and have been the authors
   and procurers of it to ourselves. Though God, in respect of his nature,
   be at an infinite distance from us; yet his mercy is near to us, and he
   cannot possibly have any self-interest in it. The Divine nature is not
   liable to want, or injury, or suffering; he is secure of his own
   happiness and fulness, and can neither wish the enlargement, nor fear
   the impairment of his estate; he can never stand in need of pity or
   relief from us, or any other, and yet he pities us.

   Now if we consider the vast difference of this affection in God and us,
   how tender his mercies are, and how sensible his bowels; and yet we who
   have so many arguments to move us to pity, how hard our hearts are, and
   how unapt to relent, as if we were born of the rock, and were the
   offspring of the nether mill-stone: sure, when we duly consider this,
   we cannot but admire the mercy of God!

   How cruel are we to creatures below us! with how little remorse can we
   kill a flea, or tread upon a t worm! partly because we are secure that
   they cannot hurt us, nor revenge themselves upon us; and partly because
   they are so despicable in our eyes, and so far below us, that they do
   not fall under the consideration of our pity. Look upward, proud man!
   and take notice of Him who is above thee: thou didst not make the
   creatures below thee, as God did; there is but a finite distance
   between thee and the meanest creatures; but there is an infinite
   distance between thee and God. Man is a name of dignity, when we
   compare ourselves with other creatures; but compared to God, we are
   worms, and not men; yea, we are nothing, yea, less than nothing, and
   vanity. How great then is the mercy of God, which regards us, who are
   so far below him, which takes into consideration such inconsiderable no
   things as we are! We may say with David, (Psal. viii. 4.) "Lord, what
   is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou
   visitest him?" and with Job, (chap. vii. 17.) "What is man, that thou
   shouldest magnify him, and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon
   him?"

   And then, how hard do we find it to forgive those who have injured us!
   If any one have offended, or provoked us, how hard are we to be
   reconciled! how mindful of an injury! how do anger and revenge boil
   within us! how do we upbraid men with their faults! what vile and low
   submission do we require of them, before we will receive them into
   favour, and grant them peace! And if we forgive once, we think that is
   much; but if an offence and provocation be renewed often, we are
   inexorable. Even the disciples of our Saviour, after he had so
   emphatically taught them forgiveness, in the petition of the Lord's
   Prayer, yet they had very narrow spirits as to this; (Matt. xviii. 21.)
   Peter comes to him, and asks him, "How often shall my brother sin
   against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" he thought that was
   much: and yet we have great obligations to pardoning and forgiving
   others, because we are obnoxious to God, and one another: we shall many
   times stand in need of pardon from God and men; and it may be our own
   case; and when it is, we are too apt to be very indulgent to ourselves,
   and conceive good hopes of the mercy of others; we would have our
   ignorance, and inadvertencies, and mistakes, and all occasions, and
   temptations, and provocations, considered; and when we have done amiss,
   upon submission and acknowledgment of our fault, we would be received
   into favour: but God, who is not at all liable to us, how ready is he
   to forgive! If we confess our sins to him, he is merciful to forgive:
   he pardons freely; and such are the condescensions of his mercy, though
   he be the party offended, yet he offers pardon to us, and beseeches us
   to be reconciled: if we do but come towards him, he runs to meet us, as
   in the parable of the prodigal, (Luke xv. 20.) What reason have we then
   thankfully to acknowledge and admire the mercy of God to us!

   Use 2. The great mercy of God to us, should stir up in us shame and
   sorrow for sin. The judgments of God may break us; but the
   consideration of God's mercy, should rather melt and dissolve us into
   tears: (Luke vii. 47.) the woman that washed Christ's feet with her
   tears, and wiped them with her hair, the account that our Saviour gives
   of the great affection that she expressed to him, was, "she loved much,
   because much was forgiven her;" and she grieved much, because much was
   forgiven her.

   Especially, we should sorrow for those sins which have been committed
   by us after God's mercies received. Mercies after sins should touch our
   hearts, and make us relent: it should grieve us that we should offend
   and provoke a God so gracious and merciful, so slow to anger, and so
   ready to forgive: but sin against mercies, and after we have received
   them, is attended with one of the greatest aggravations of sin. And as
   mercy raises the guilt of our sins, so it should raise our sorrow for
   them. No consideration is more apt to work upon human nature, than that
   of kindness; and the greater mercy has been shewed to us, the greater
   our sins, and the greater cause of sorrow for them; contraries do
   illustrate, and set off one another; in the great goodness and mercy of
   God to us, we see the great evil of our sins against him.

   Every sin has the nature of rebellion and disobedience; but sins
   against mercy have ingratitude in them. Whenever we break the laws of
   God, we rebel against our sovereign; but as we sin against the mercies
   of God, we injure our benefactor. This makes our sin to be horrid, and
   astonishing; (Isa. i. 2.) "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for
   the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and
   they have rebelled against me." All the mercies of God are aggravations
   of our sins; (2 Sam. xii. 7, 8, 9.) "And Nathan said to David, Thou art
   the man. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee king over
   Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hands of Saul: and I gave thee
   thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave
   thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little,
   I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. Wherefore
   hast thon despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his
   sight?" God reckons up all his mercies, and from them aggravates
   David's sin; (1 Kings xi. 9.) he takes notice of all the unkind returns
   that we make to his mercy: and it is the worst temper in the world, not
   to be wrought upon by kindness, not to be melted by mercy: no greater
   evidence of a wicked heart, than that the mercies of God have no effect
   upon it; (Isa. xxvi. 10.) "Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will
   he not learn righteousness."

   Use 3. Let us imitate the merciful nature of God. This branch of God's
   goodness is very proper for our imitation. The general exhortation of
   our Saviour, (Matt. v. 48.) "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
   Father which is in heaven is perfect;" is more particularly expressed
   by St. Luke, (chap. vi. 36.) "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father
   also is merciful." Men affect to make images, and impossible
   representations of God; but, as Seneca saith, Crede Deos, cum propitii
   essent, fictiles fuisse, We may draw this image and likeness of God; we
   may be gracious and merciful as he is. Christ, who was the express
   image of his Father, his whole life and undertaking was a continued
   work of mercy; he "went about doing good" to the souls of men, by
   preaching the gospel to them; and to the bodies of men, in healing all
   manner of diseases: there is no thing that he recommends more to us, in
   his gospel, than this spirit and temper; (Matt. v. 7.) "Blessed are the
   merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." How many parables cloth he use,
   to set forth the mercy of God to us, with a design to draw us to the
   imitation of it? The parable of the prodigal; of the good Samaritan; of
   the servant to whom he forgave ten thou sand talents. We should imitate
   God in this, in being tender and compassionate to those that are in
   misery.

   This is a piece of natural, indispensable religion, to which positive
   and instituted religion must give way. (Hosea vi. 6.) "I desired mercy,
   and not sacrifice;" which is twice cited and used by our Saviour.
   (Micah vi. 8.) "He hath shewed thee, O man, what it is that the Lord
   thy God requires of thee; to do justice, and love mercy, and to walk
   humbly with thy God."

   This is always one part of the description of a good man, that he is
   apt to pity the miseries and necessities of others; (Psal. xxxvii. 26.)
   "He is ever merciful, and lendeth." He is far from cruelty, not only to
   men, but even to the brute creatures; (Prov. xii. 10.) "A righteous man
   regardeth the life of his beast." There is nothing more contrary to the
   nature of God, than a cruel and savage disposition, not to be affected
   with the miseries and sufferings of others: how unlike is this to "the
   Father of mercies, and the God of consolation!" When we can see cruelty
   exercised, and our bowels not to be stirred within us, nor our hearts
   be pricked; how unlike is this to God, who is very pitiful, and of
   tender mercies! but to rejoice at the miseries of others, this is
   inhuman and barbarous. Hear how God threatens Edom for rejoicing at the
   miseries of his brother Jacob, (Obad. ver. 10-14.) But to delight to
   make others miserable, and to aggravate their sufferings; this is
   devilish, this is the temper of hell, and the very spirit of the
   destroyer.

   It becomes man, above all other creatures, to be merciful, who hath had
   such ample and happy experience of God's mercy to him, and cloth still
   continually stand in need of mercy from God. God hath been very
   merciful to us. Had it not been for the tender mercies of God to us, we
   had all of us, long since, been miserable. Now as we have received
   mercy from God, we should shew it to others. The apostle useth this as
   an argument why we should relieve those that are in misery and want,
   because we have had such experience of the mercy and love of God to us;
   (1 John iii. 16, 17.) "Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he
   laid down his life for us. But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth
   his brother have need, &c. how dwelleth the love of God in him?" That
   man hath no sense of the mercy of God abiding upon his heart, that is
   not merciful to his brother. And it is an argument why we should
   forgive one another; (Eph. iv. 32.) "Be ye kind one to another,
   tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
   hath forgiven you." (Chap. v. 1.) "Be ye, therefore, followers of God,
   as dear children." (Col. iii. 12, 13.) "Put on therefore (as the elect
   of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of
   mind, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving
   one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ
   forgave you, so also do ye."

   And we continually stand in need of mercy both from God and man. We are
   liable one to another; and in the change of human affairs, we may be
   all subject to one another by turns, and stand in need of one another's
   pity and compassion; and we must expect, that "with what measure we
   mete to others, with the same it shall be measured to us again." To
   restrain the cruelties, and check the insolences of men, God has so
   ordered, in his providence, that very often, in this world, men's
   cruelties return upon their own heads, and their violent dealings upon
   their own pates." Bajazet meets with a Tamerlane.

   But if men were not thus liable to one another, we all stand in need of
   mercy from God. If we be merciful to others in suffering, and forgiving
   them that have injured us, God will be so to us, he will pardon our
   sins to us: (Prov. xvi. 6.) "By mercy and truth iniquity is purged." (2
   Sam. xxii. 26.) "With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful."
   (Prov. xiv. 21.) "He that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he." (Prov.
   xxi. 21.) "He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth
   life." (Matt. vi. 14.) "If ye forgive men their trespasses, your
   heavenly Father will also forgive you." But, on the other hand, if we
   be malicious and revengeful, and implacable to those that have offended
   us, and in exorable to those who desire to be received to favour, and
   cruel to those who lie at our mercy, hard hearted to them that are in
   necessity; what can we expect but that the mercy of God will leave us,
   that he will "forget to be gracious, and shut up in anger his tender
   mercy." (Matt. vi. 15.) "If ye forgive not men their trespasses,
   neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." That is a dreadful
   pas sage: (St. James ii. 13.) "He shall have judgment without mercy,
   that hath shewed no mercy." How angry is the lord with the servant who
   was so inexorable to his fellow-servant, after he had forgiven him so
   great a debt, as you find in the parable; (Matt. xviii. 24.) he owed
   him ten thousand talents, and, upon his submission and entreaty to have
   patience with him, he was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and
   forgave him all: but no sooner had this favour been done to him by his
   lord, but, going forth, he meets his fellow-servant, who owed a small,
   inconsiderable debt, a hundred pence; he lays hands on him and takes
   him by the throat, and roundly demands payment of him: he falls down at
   his feet, and useth the same form of supplication that he had used to
   his lord; but he rejects his request, and puts him in prison. Now what
   saith the lord to him: (ver. 32-34.) "O thou wicked servant, I forgave
   thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest not thou also
   have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?
   And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he
   should pay all that was due unto him." Now what application doth our
   Saviour make of this? (Ver. 35.) "So likewise shall my heavenly Father
   do also unto you, if ye, from your hearts, forgive not every one his
   brother their trespasses."

   God's readiness to forgive us should be a powerful motive and argument
   to us to forgive others. The greatest injuries that we can suffer from
   men, if we compare them to the sins that we commit against God, they
   bear no proportion to them, neither in weight nor number; they are but
   as a hundred pence to ten thousand talents. If we would be like God, we
   should forgive the greatest injuries; he pardoneth our sins, though
   they be exceeding great; many injuries, though offences be renewed, and
   provocations multiplied; for so God doth to us: "He pardoneth iniquity,
   transgression, and sin." (Exod. xxxiv. 7.) (Isa. lv. 7.) "He will have
   mercy, he will abundantly pardon." We would not have God only to
   forgive us seven times, but seventy times seven, as often as we offend
   him; so should we forgive our brother.

   And we should not be backward to this work; God is "ready to forgive
   us." (Nehem. ix. 17.) And we should do it heartily, not only in word,
   when we retain malice in our hearts; and while we say we forgive, carry
   on a secret design in our hearts of revenging ourselves when we have
   opportunity, but we should, "from our hearts, forgive every one;" for
   so God doth to us, who, when he forgives us, "casts our iniquities
   behind his back, and throws them into the bottom of the sea, and blots
   out our transgression, so as to remember our iniquity no more."

   If we do not thus, every time we put up the petition to God, "Forgive
   us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us," we do
   not pray for mercy, but for judgment; we invoke his wrath, and do not
   put up a prayer, but a dreadful imprecation against ourselves; we
   pronounce the sentence of our own condemnation, and importune God not
   to forgive us.

   Use 4. If the mercy of God be so great, this may comfort us against
   despair. Sinners are apt to be dejected, when they consider their
   unworthiness, the nature and number of their sins, and the many heavy
   aggravations of them; they are apt to say with Cain, that "their sin is
   greater than can be forgiven." But do not look only upon thy sins, but
   upon the mercies of God. Thou canst not be too sensible of the evil of
   sin, and of the desert of it; but whilst we aggravate our sins, we must
   not lessen the mercies of God. When we consider the multitude of our
   sins, we must consider also the multitude of God's tender mercies: we
   have been great sinners, and God is of great mercy; we have multiplied
   our provocations, and he multiplies to pardon.

   Do but thou put thyself in a capacity of mercy, by repenting of thy
   sins, and forsaking of them, and thou hast no reason to doubt but the
   mercy of God will receive thee: "If we confess our sins, he is merciful
   and faithful to forgive them." If we had offended man, as we have done
   God, we might despair of pardon; but it is God, and not man, that we
   have to deal with; and "his ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts
   as our thoughts: but as the heavens are high above the earth, so are
   his ways above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts."

   We cannot be more injurious to God than by hard thoughts of him, as if
   fury were in him, and, when we have provoked him, he were not to be
   appeased and reconciled to us. We disparage the goodness and truth of
   God, when we distrust those gracious declarations which he has made of
   his mercy and goodness; if we do not think that he doth heartily pity
   and compassionate sinners, and really desire their happiness. Doth not
   he condescend so low as to represent himself afflicted for the miseries
   of men, and to rejoice in the conversion of a sinner? And shall not we
   believe that he is in good earnest? Doth Christ weep over impenitent
   sinners, because "they will not know the things of their peace?" and
   canst thou think he will not pardon thee upon thy repentance? Is he
   grieved that men will undo themselves, and will not be saved? and canst
   thou think that he is unwilling to forgive? We cannot honour and
   glorify God more, than by entertaining great thoughts of his mercy. As
   we are said to glorify God by our repentance, because thereby we
   acknowledge God's holiness and justice, so we glorify him by believing
   his mercy, because we conceive a right opinion of his goodness and
   truth; we set to our seal, that God is merciful and true: (Psal.
   cxlvii. 11.) it is said, that "God takes pleasure in them that hope in
   his mercy." As he delights in mercy, so in our acknowledgments of it;
   that sinners should conceive great hopes of it, and believe him to be
   what he is. Provided thou dost submit to the terms of God's mercy, thou
   hast no reason to despair of it: and he that thinks that his sins are
   more or greater than the mercy of God can pardon, must think that there
   may be more evil in the creature than there is goodness in God.

   Use 5. By way of caution against the presumptuous sinner. If there be
   any that trespass upon the goodness of God, and presume to encourage
   themselves in sin, upon the hopes of his mercy; let such know that God
   is just, as well as merciful. A God of all mercy is an idol, such a God
   as men set up in their own imaginations, but not the true God whom the
   Scriptures describe: to such persons the Scripture describes him after
   another manner: (Nahum i. 2.) "God is jealous; the Lord revengeth, and
   is furious; the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries, and
   reserveth wrath for his enemies." If any man abuse the mercy of God, to
   "the strengthening of himself in his own wickedness, and bless himself
   in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the
   imagination of mine heart, and add drunkenness to thirst; the Lord will
   not spare him, but the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke
   against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book
   shall lie upon him, and the Lord will blot out his name from under
   heaven." (Deut. xxix. 19, 20.)

   Though it be the nature of God to be merciful, yet the exercise of his
   mercy is regulated by his wisdom; he will not be merciful to those that
   despise his mercy, to those that abuse it, to those that are resolved
   to go on in their sins to tempt his mercy, and make bold to say, "Let
   us sin that grace may abound." God designs his mercy for those that are
   prepared to receive it; (Isa. lv. 7.) "Let the wicked forsake his ways,
   and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and turn unto the Lord, and he
   will have mercy, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." The
   mercy of God is an enemy to sin, as well as his justice; and it is no
   where offered to countenance sin, but to convert the sinner; and is not
   intended to encourage our impenitency, but our repentance. God hath no
   where said that he will be merciful to those who, upon the score of his
   mercy, are bold with him, and presume to offend him; but "the mercy of
   the Lord is upon them that fear him, and keep his covenant, and
   remember his commandments to do them." There is forgiveness with him,
   "that he may be feared," but not that he may be despised and affronted.
   This is to contradict the very end of God's mercy, which is, to "lead
   us to repentance," to engage us to leave our sins, not to encourage us
   to continue in them.

   Take heed, then, of abusing the mercy of God: we cannot provoke the
   justice of God more, than by presuming upon his mercy. This is the time
   of God's mercy; use this opportunity: if thon neglectest it, a day of
   justice and vengeance is coming; (Rom. ii. 4, 5.) "Despisest thou the
   riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering, not
   knowing that the goodness of God leads to repentance? and treasurest up
   unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and the revelation of the
   righteous judgment of God?" Now is the manifestation of God's mercy;
   but there is a time a coming, when the righteous judgment of God will
   be revealed against those who abuse his mercy, "not knowing that the
   goodness of God leadeth to repentance." To think that the goodness of
   God was intended for any other end than to take us off from sin, is a
   gross and affected ignorance that will ruin us; and they who draw any
   conclusion from the mercy of God, which may harden them in their sins,
   they are such as the prophet speaks of; (Isa. xxvii. 11.) "A people of
   no understanding, therefore he that made them will not save them; and
   he that formed them will shew them no favour." Mercy itself will
   rejoice in the ruin of those that abuse it, and it will aggravate their
   condemnation. There is no person towards whom God will be more severely
   just, than towards such. The justice of God, exasperated and set on by
   his injured and abused mercy, like a razor set in oil, will have the
   keener edge, and be the sharper for its smoothness. Those that have
   made the mercy of God their enemy, must expect the worst his justice
   can do unto them.

SERMON CXLVIII.

  THE PATIENCE OF GOD.

   The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
   slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any
   should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Pet. iii. 9.

   IN the beginning of this chapter, the apostle puts the Christians, to
   whom he writes, in mind of the predictions of the ancient prophets, and
   of the apostles of our Lord and Saviour, concerning the general
   judgment of the world, which by many (and, perhaps, by the apostles
   themselves) had been thought to be very near, and that it would
   presently follow the destruction of Jerusalem; but he tells them, that
   before that, there would arise a certain sect, or sort of men, that
   would deride the expectation of a future judgment, designing, probably,
   the Carpocratians (a branch of that large sect of the Gnostics), of
   whom St. Austin expressly says, "That they denied the resurrection,
   and, consequently, a future judgment." These St. Peter calls scoffers,
   (ver. 3, 4.) "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last
   days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the
   promise of his coming?" The word is epangeli'a, which signifies a
   declaration in general, whether it be by way of promise or threatening.
   What is become of that declaration of Christ, so frequently repeated in
   the gospel, concerning his coming to judgment? "For since the fathers
   fell asleep," or, saving that the fathers are fallen asleep, except
   only that men die, and one generation succeeds another, "all things
   continue as they were from the creation of the world;" that is, the
   world continues still as it was from the beginning, and there is no
   sign of any such change and alteration as is foretold. To this he
   answers two things:

   I. That these scoffers, though they took themselves to be wits, did
   betray great ignorance, both of the condition of the world, and of the
   nature of God: they talked very ignorantly concerning the world, when
   they said, "all things continued as they were from the creation of it,"
   when so remark able a change had already happened, as the destruction
   of it by water; and therefore, the prediction concerning the
   destruction of it by fire, before the great and terrible day of
   judgment, was no ways incredible. And they shewed themselves, likewise,
   very ignorant of the perfection of the Divine nature; to which, being
   eternally the same, a thousand years and one day are all one: and if
   God make good his word some thousands of years hence, it will make no
   sensible difference concerning his eternal duration; it being no matter
   when a duration begins, which is never to have an end; (ver. 8.) "Be
   not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thou
   sand years, and a thousand years as one day." This, it seems, was a
   common saying among the Jews, to signify, that to the eternity of God,
   no finite du ration bears any proportion; and therefore, with regard to
   eternity, it is all one whether it be a thou sand years, or one day.
   The Psalmist hath an expression much to the same purpose; (Psal. xc.
   4.) For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday, when it is
   past, and as a watch in the night." And the son of Sirach likewise,
   (Ecclus. xviii. 10.) "As a drop of water to the sea, and as a grain of
   sand to the sea-shore, so are a thousand years to the days of
   eternity."

   The like expression we meet with in heathen writers; "To the gods no
   time is long," saith Pythagoras: and Plutarch, "The whole space of a
   man's life, to the gods, is as nothing." And in his excellent discourse
   of the slowness of the Divine vengeance (the very argument St. Peter is
   here upon), he hath this passage, "that a thousand, or ten thou sand
   years, are but as an indivisible point to an in finite duration." And
   therefore, when the judgment is to be eternal, the delay of it, though
   it were for a thousand years, is an objection of no force, against
   either the certainty, or the terror of it; for, to eternity, all time
   is equally short; and it matters not when the punishment of sinners
   begins, if it shall never have an end.

   2. But because the distance between the declaration of a future
   judgment, and the coming of it, though it be nothing to God, yet it
   seemed long to them; therefore he gives such an account of it, as doth
   not in the least impeach the truth and faithfulness of God, but is a
   clear argument and demonstration of his goodness. Admitting what they
   said to be true, that God delays judgment for a great while, yet this
   gives no ground to conclude that judgment will never be; but it shews
   the great goodness of God to sinners, that he gives them so long a
   space of repentance, that so they may prevent the terror of that day,
   whenever it comes, and escape that dreadful ruin, which will certainly
   overtake, sooner or later, all impenitent sinners: "the Lord is not
   slack concerning his promise," that is, as to the declaration which he
   hath made of a future judgment, "as some men count slackness;" that is,
   as if the delay of judgment were an argument it would never come. This
   is a false inference from the delay of punishment, and an ill
   interpretation of the goodness of God to sinners, who bears long with
   them, and delays judgment, on purpose to give men time to repent, and,
   by repentance, to prevent their own eternal ruin: "God is not slack
   concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is
   long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that
   all should come to repentance." In the handling of these words, I shall
   do these three things:

   First, I shall consider the patience and long-suffering of God, as it
   is an attribute and perfection of the Divine nature; "God is
   long-suffering to us-ward."

   Secondly, I shall shew that the patience of God, and the delay of
   judgment, is no just ground why sinners should hope for impunity, as
   the scoffers, here foretold by the apostle, argued, that because our
   Lord delayeth his coming to judgment so long, therefore he would never
   come; "God is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
   slackness."

   Thirdly, I will consider the true reason of God's patience and
   long-suffering towards mankind, which the apostle here gives; "He is
   long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that
   all should come to repentance."

   First, I will consider the patience and long-suffering of God towards
   mankind, as it is an attribute and perfection of the Divine nature;
   "God is long-suffering to us-ward." In the handling of this, I shall do
   these three things:

   I. I shall shew what is meant by the patience and long-suffering of
   God.

   II. That this is a perfection of the Divine nature.

   III. I shall give some proof and demonstration of the great patience
   and long-suffering of God to mankind.

   I. What is meant by the patience and long-suffering of God.

   The Hebrew word signifies, one that keeps his anger long, or that is
   long before he is angry. In the New Testament it is sometimes expressed
   by the word upomone`, which signifies God's forbearance, and patient
   waiting for our repentance; sometimes by the word anoche`, which
   signifies God's holding in his wrath and restraining himself from
   punishing; and sometimes by makrothumi'a, which signifies the extent of
   his patience, his long-suffering, and forbearing for a long time the
   punishment due to sinners.

   So that the patience of God is his goodness to sinners, in deferring or
   moderating the punishment due to them for their sins: the deferring of
   deserved punishment in whole, or in part, which, if it be extended to a
   long time, it is properly his long-suffering: and the moderating, as
   well as the deferring of the punishment due to sin, is an instance
   likewise of God's patience; and not only the deferring and moderating
   of temporal punishment, but the adjourning of the eternal misery of
   sinners, is a principal instance of God's patience; so that the
   patience of God takes in all that space of repentance which God affords
   to sinners in this life; nay, all temporal judgments and afflictions
   which befal sinners in this life, and are short of cutting them off,
   and turning them into hell, are comprehended in the patience of God.
   Whenever God punisheth, it is of his great mercy and patience that we
   are not consumed, and because his compassions fail not. I proceed to
   the

   II. Second thing I proposed, which was to shew, that patience is a
   perfection of the Divine nature.

   It is not necessarily due to us, but it is due to the perfection of the
   Divine nature, and essentially be longs to it: it is a principal branch
   of God's goodness, which is the highest and most glorious perfection of
   all other; and therefore we always find it in Scripture, in the company
   of God's milder and sweeter attributes. When God would give the most
   perfect description of himself, and, as he says to Moses, "make all his
   glory to pass before us," he usually does it by those attributes which
   declare his goodness; and patience is always one of them. (Exod. xxxiv.
   6.) "The Lord passed by before Moses, and proclaimed, The Lord, the
   Lord God merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in
   goodness and truth." (Psal. lxxxvi. 15.) "But thou, O Lord, art a God
   full of compassion, and gracious, long-suffering, and plenteous in
   mercy and truth." (Psal. ciii. 8.) "The Lord is merciful and gracious,
   slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy." And the same you find, Psal.
   cxlv. 8. Jonah iv. 2. Joel ii. 13.

   Sometimes, indeed, you find a severer attribute added to these, as that
   "he will by no means clear the guilty," (Exod. xxxiv. 7.) But it is
   always put in the last place; to declare to us, that God's goodness,
   and mercy, and patience, are his first and primary perfections: and it
   is only when these fail, and have no effect upon us, but are abused by
   us, to the encouragement of ourselves in an impenitent course, that his
   justice takes place.

   Nay, even among men, it is esteemed a perfection, to be able to forbear
   and to restrain our anger; passion is impotency and folly, but patience
   is power and wisdom. (Prov. xiv. 29.) "He that is slow to wrath, is of
   great understanding; but he that is hasty of spirit, exalteth folly."
   (Prov. xvi. 32.) "He that is slow to anger, is better than the mighty;
   and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city." (Rom. xii.
   21.) "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good." To be
   impatient, is to be overcome; but to forbear anger and revenge, is a
   victory. Patience is an argument of great power and command of
   ourselves; and therefore God himself, who is the most powerful being,
   is slow to anger, and of infinite patience; and nothing doth more
   declare the power of God, than his patience; that when he is provoked
   by such vile and despicable creatures as we are, he can withhold his
   hand from destroying us. This is the argument which Moses useth, (Numb.
   xiv. 17, 18.) that the power of God doth so eminently appear in his
   patience; "And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
   according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is gracious, and
   long-suffering." And yet power, where it is not restrained by wisdom
   and goodness, is a great temptation to anger; because where there is
   power, there is something to back it, and make it good: and therefore
   the Psalmist doth recommend and set off the patience of God, from the
   consideration of his power; (Psal. vii. 11.) "God is strong and
   patient; God is provoked every day:" God is strong, and therefore
   patient; or, he is infinitely patient, not withstanding his almighty
   power to revenge the daily provocations of his creatures.

   Among men, anger and weakness commonly go together; but they are ill
   matched, as is excellently observed by the son of Sirach: (Ecclus. x.
   18.) "Pride was not made for man, nor furious anger for him that is
   born of a woman." So that anger and impatience is every where
   unreasonable. Where there is power, impatience is below it, and a thing
   too mean for omnipotency: and where there wants power, anger is above
   it; it is too much for a weak and impotent creature to be angry. Where
   there is power, anger is needless, and of no use; and where there is no
   power, it is vain and to no purpose. So that patience is every where a
   perfection, both to God and man. I proceed to the

   III. Third thing I proposed, which was, to give some proof and
   demonstration of the great patience and long-suffering of God to
   mankind. And this will evidently appear, if we consider these two
   things:

   1. How men deal with God.

   2. How, notwithstanding this, God deals with them.

   1. How men deal with God. Every day we highly offend and provoke him,
   we grieve and weary him with our iniquities, as the expression is in
   the prophet: (Isa. xliii. 24.) "Thou hast made me to serve with thy
   sins; thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities." Every sin that we
   commit is an affront to the Divine Majesty, and a contempt of his
   authority: by denying submission to his laws, we question his
   omnipresence, and say, "Doth God see? and is there knowledge in the
   Most High?" Or if we acknowledge his omnipresence, and that he regards
   what we do, the provocation is still the greater; because then we
   affront him to his face; we dare his justice, and challenge his
   omnipotency, and "provoke the Lord to jealousy," as if "we were
   stronger than he."

   Is not God patient, when the whole world lies in wickedness, and the
   earth is overspread with violence, and is full of the habitations of
   cruelty? when he, who is "of purer eyes than to behold iniquity," and
   is so highly offended at the sins of men, hath yet the patience to look
   upon "them that deal treacherously, and to hold his peace?" when the
   "wicked persecutes and devours the man that is more righteous than he?"
   when even that part of the world which professeth the name of God and
   Christ, do, by their vile and abominable lives, "blaspheme that holy
   and glorious name whereby they are called."

   Every moment God hath greater injuries done to him, and more affronts
   put upon him, than were ever offered to all the sons of men; and,
   surely, provocations are trials of patience, especially when they are
   so numerous, and so heinous; for if offences rise according to the
   dignity of the person injured, and the meanness of him that cloth the
   injury, then no offences are so great as those that are committed by
   men against God, no affronts like to those which are offered to the
   Divine Majesty by the continual provocations of his creatures. And is
   not this an argument of God's patience, that the glorious Majesty of
   heaven should bear such multiplied indignities from such vile worms?
   that he who is the Former of alt things, should endure his own
   creatures to rebel against him, and the work of his hands to strike at
   him? that he who is our great Benefactor, should put up such affronts
   from those who depend upon his bounty, and are maintained at his
   charge? that he, "in whose hands our breath is," should suffer men to
   breathe out oaths, and curses, and blasphemies against him? Surely,
   these prove the patience of God to purpose, and are equally trials and
   arguments of it.

   2. The patience of God will farther appear, if we consider how,
   notwithstanding all this, God deals with us. He is patient to the whole
   world, in that he doth not turn us out of being, and "turn the wicked"
   together "into hell, with all the nations that forget God." He is
   patient to the greatest part of mankind, in that he makes but a few
   terrible examples of his justice, "that others may hear and fear," and
   take warning by them. He is patient to particular persons, in that,
   notwithstanding our daily provocations, he "prevents us daily with the
   blessing" of his goodness, prolonging our lives and vouchsafing so many
   favours to us, that, "by this great goodness, we may be led to
   repentance."

   But the patience of God will more illustriously appear, if we consider
   these following particulars, which are so many evidences and instances
   of it.

   1. That God is not obliged to spare and forbear us at all. It is
   patience, that he doth not surprise us in the very act of sin, and let
   fly at us with a thunderbolt so soon as ever we have offended; that the
   wrath of God doth not fall upon the intemperate person, as it did upon
   the Israelites, "while the meat and drink is yet in their mouths;" that
   a man is not struck dead or mad whilst he is telling a lie; that the
   soul of the profane and false-swearer does not expire with his oaths
   and perjuries.

   2. That God spares us, when it is in his power so easily to ruin us;
   when he can with one word command us out of being, and by cutting
   asunder one little thread, let us drop into hell. If God were disposed
   to severity, he could deal with us after another manner, and, as the
   expression is in the prophet, "ease himself of his adversaries, and be
   avenged of his enemies."

   3. That God exerciseth this patience to sinners, flagrante bello, while
   they are up in arms against him, and committing hostilities upon him;
   he bears with us even when we are challenging his justice to punish us,
   and provoking his power to destroy us.

   4. That he is so very slow and unwilling to punish and to inflict his
   judgments upon us. As for eternal punishments, God defers them a long
   while, and by all proper ways and means endeavours to prevent them, and
   to bring us to repentance. And as for those temporal judgments which
   God inflicts upon sinners, he carries himself so, that we may plainly
   see all the signs of unwillingness that can be; he tries to prevent
   them; he is loath to set about this work; and when he does, it is with
   much reluctance; and then he is easily persuaded and prevailed withal
   not to do it; and when he does, he does it not rigorously, and to
   extremity; and he is soon taken off, after he is engaged in it: all
   which are great instances and evidences of his wonderful patience to
   sinners.

   (1.) God's unwillingness to punish, appears in that he labours to
   prevent punishment; and that he may effectually do this, he endeavours
   to prevent sin, the meritorious cause of God's judgments: to this end,
   he hath threatened it with severe punishments, that the dread of them
   may make us afraid to offend; and if this will not do, he does not yet
   give us over, but gives us a space of repentance, and invites us
   earnestly to turn to him, and thereby to prevent his judgments; he
   expostulates with sinners, and reasons the case with them, as if he
   were more concerned not to punish, than they are not to be punished:
   and thus, by his earnest desire of our repentance, he shews how little
   he desires our ruin.

   (2.) He is long before he goes about this work. Judgment is, in
   Scripture, called "his strange work;" as if he were not acquainted with
   it, and hardly knew how to go about it on the sudden. He is represented
   as not prepared for such a work; (Deut. xxxii. 41.) "If I whet my
   glittering sword;" as if the instruments of punishment were not ready
   for us. Nay, by a strange kind of condescension to our capacities, and
   to set forth to us the patience of God, and his slowness to wrath,
   after the manner of men, he is represented as keeping out of the way,
   that he may not be tempted to destroy us; (Exod. xxxiii. 2, 3.) where
   he tells Moses, that he would send an angel before them; "For I will
   not go up in the midst of thee, lest I consume thee in the way."

   At works of mercy he is very ready and forward. When Daniel prayed for
   the deliverance of the people of Israel out of captivity, the angel
   tells him, that "at the beginning of his supplication, the commandment
   came forth," to bring him a promise of their deliverance. The mercy of
   God, many times, prevents our prayers, and outruns our wishes and
   desires: but when he comes to affliction, he takes time to do it; he
   passeth by many provocations, and waits long in expectation, that, by
   our repentance, he will prevent his judgments: "He hearkened and heard,
   (saith God in the prophet Jeremiah) but they spake not aright; no man
   repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?" He is
   represented as waiting and listening, to hear if any penitent word
   should drop from them; he gives the sinner time to repent and reflect
   upon his actions, and to consider what he hath done, and space to
   reason himself into repentance. For this reason the judgments of God do
   often follow the sins of men at a great distance; otherwise he could
   easily make them mend their pace, and "consume us in a moment."

   (3.) When he goes about this work, he does it with much reluctance:
   (Hosea xi. 8.) "How shall I give thee up, Ephraim; how shall I deliver
   thee, Israel? Mine heart is turned within me, and my repentings are
   kindled together." He is represented as making many essays and offers
   before he came to it: (Psal. cvi. 26.) "Many a time lifted he up his
   hand in the wilderness to destroy them." He made as if he would do it,
   and let fall his hand again, as if he could not find in his heart to be
   so severe. God withholds his judgments till he is weary of holding in,
   as the expression is, (Jer. vi. 11.) until he can forbear no longer;
   (Jer. xliv. 22.) "So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the
   evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have
   committed."

   (4.) God is easily prevailed upon not to punish. When he seemed
   resolved upon it to destroy the murmuring of the Israelites, yet how
   often, at the intercession of Moses, did he turn away his wrath? That
   he will accept of very low terms to spare a very wicked people, appears
   by the instance of Sodom, where, if there had been but "ten righteous
   persons," he would not have destroyed them for the ten's sake. Yea,
   when his truth seemed to have been pawned (at least in the apprehension
   of his prophet), yet even then repentance took him off, as in the case
   of Nineveh. Nay, how glad is he to be thus prevented! With what joy
   does he tell the prophet the news of Ahab's humiliation! "Seest thou
   how Ahab humbleth himself? Because he humbleth himself, I will not
   bring the evil in his days."

   (5.) When he punisheth, he does it very seldom rigorously, and to
   extremity, not so much as we deserve; (Psal. ciii. 10.) "He hath not
   dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our
   iniquities." Nor so much as he can, he doth not let loose the
   fierceness of his anger, nor pour forth all his wrath; (Psal. lxxviii.
   38.) "He being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
   destroyed them not; yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did
   not stir up all his wrath."

   (6.) After he hath begun to punish, and is engaged in the work, he is
   not hard to be taken off. There is a famous instance of this, 2 Sam.
   xxiv. when God had sent three days pestilence upon Israel, for David's
   sin in numbering the people, and, at the end of the third day, the
   angel of the Lord had stretched forth his hand over Jerusalem, to
   destroy it; upon the prayer of David, it is said, that the "Lord
   repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is
   enough; stay now thine hand." Nay, so ready is God to be taken off from
   this work, that he sets a high value upon those who stand in the gap to
   turn away his wrath; (Numb. xxv. 11-13.) "Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
   the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the
   children of Israel (while he was zealous for my sake among them), that
   I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. Wherefore say,
   Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: and he shall have it, and
   his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood;
   because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the
   children of Israel." That which God values in this action of Phinehas,
   next to his zeal for him, is, that "he turned away his wrath, and made
   an atonement for the children of Israel."

   5. And lastly, The patience of God will yet appear with farther
   advantage, if we consider some eminent and remarkable instances of it;
   which are so much the more considerable, because they are instances not
   only of God's patience extended to a long time, but to a great many
   persons; the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah upon the
   whole world, as is probably conjectured, for the space of a hundred and
   twenty years. God bore with the people of Israel in the wilderness,
   after they had tempted him ten times, for the space of forty years;
   (Acts xiii. 18.) "And about the time of forty years suffered he their
   manners in the wilderness." And this instance of God's patience will be
   the more remarkable, if we compare it with the great impatience of that
   people; if they did but want flesh or water, they were out of patience
   with God; when Moses was in the mount with God but forty days, they
   presently fall to make new gods; they had not the patience of forty
   days, and yet God bore their manners forty years. God had spared
   Nineveh for some ages; and when his patience was even expired, and he
   seems to have passed a final sentence upon it, yet he grants a reprieve
   for forty days, that they might sue out their pardon in that time: and
   they did so; "They turned from their evil ways, and God turned from the
   evil he said he would do them, and he did it not."

   But the most remarkable instance of God's long-suffering is to the
   Jews, if we consider it with all the circumstances of it; after they
   had rejected the Son of God, notwithstanding the purity of his
   doctrine, and the power of his miracles; after they had unjustly
   condemned, and cruelly murdered, the Lord of life, yet the patience of
   God respited the ruin of that people forty years.

   Besides all these, there are many instances of God's patience to
   particular persons: but it were endless to enumerate these; every one
   of us may be an instance to ourselves of God's long-suffering.

   I shall only add, as a farther advantage to set off the patience of God
   to sinners, that his forbearance is so great, that he hath been
   complained of for it by his own servants. Job, who was so patient a man
   himself, thought much at it; (Job xxi. 7, 8.) "Wherefore do the wicked
   live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? Their seed is established
   in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes." Jonah
   challengeth God for it; (chap. iv. 2.) "Was not this my saying, when I
   was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish; for I
   knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger," &c.
   Jonah had observed God to be so prone to this, that he was loath to be
   sent upon his message, lest God should discredit his prophet, in not
   being so good (shall I say, so severe) as his word.

   I have done with the first thing I proposed to speak to; viz. The great
   patience and long-suffering of God to mankind.

SERMON CXLIX.

  THE PATIENCE OF GOD.

   The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
   slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any
   should perish, but that all should come to repentance.--2 Pet. iii. 9.

   I HAVE made entrance into these words; in the handling of which, I
   proposed to do these three things:

   First, To consider the patience and long-suffering of God, as it is an
   attribute and perfection of the Divine nature; "God is long-suffering
   to us-ward."

   Secondly, To shew, that the patience of God, and the delay of his
   judgment, is no just ground why sinners should hope for impunity; "God
   is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness."

   Thirdly, To consider the true reason of God's patience and
   long-suffering towards mankind; "He is long-suffering to us-ward; not
   willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
   repentance." I have already spoken to the

   First of these; namely, The patience and long-suffering of God, as it
   is an attribute and perfection of the Divine nature. I proceed now to
   the

   Second thing I proposed; namely, To shew, that he patience of God, and
   the delay of judgment, is no just ground why sinners should hope for
   impunity; "God is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
   slackness;" that is, as the scoffers, here mentioned by the apostle,
   did ignorantly and maliciously reason, that because our Lord delayed
   his coming to judgment so long, therefore he would never come.

   There was, indeed, some pretence for this objection; because the
   Christians did generally apprehend that the day of judgment was very
   near, and that it would immediately follow the destruction of
   Jerusalem; and it seems, the disciples themselves were of that
   persuasion before our Saviour's death: when our Saviour discoursing to
   them of the destruction of the temple, they put these two questions to
   him: (Matt. xxiv. 3.) "And as he sate upon the mount of Olives, the
   disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these
   things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of
   the world?" "When shall these things be? that is, the things he had
   been speaking of immediately before, viz. the destruction of Jerusalem,
   and the dissolution of the temple; that is plainly the meaning of the
   first question; to which they subjoined another, "and what shall be the
   sign of thy coming?" that is, to judgment, "and of the end of the
   world?" which, in all probability, was added to the former, because
   they supposed that the one was presently to follow the other, and
   therefore the same answer would serve them both: and it appears by our
   Saviour's answer, that he was not concerned to rectify them in this
   mistake, which might be of good use to them, both to make them more
   zealous to propagate the gospel, since there was like to be so little
   time for it; and likewise to wean their affections from this world,
   which they thought to be so near an end.

   One thing, indeed, our Saviour says, which (had they not been
   prepossessed with another opinion) does sufficiently intimate, that
   there might be a considerable space of time betwixt the destruction of
   Jerusalem and the day of judgment; and this we find only in St. Luke,
   (chap. xxi. 24.) where, speaking of the miseries and calamities that
   should come upon the Jews, he says, "They shall fall by the edge of the
   sword, and be carried into captivity into all nations; and Jerusalem
   shall be trodden down of the gentiles, until the time of the gentiles
   be fulfilled." So that here were a great many events fore told, betwixt
   the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world, the
   accomplishment whereof might take up a great deal of time, as appears
   by the event of things; Jerusalem being at this day still "trodden down
   by the gentiles," and the Jews still continuing "dispersed over the
   world:" but the disciples, it seems, did not much mind this, being
   carried away with a prejudicate conceit, that the end of the world
   would happen before the end of that age; in which they were much
   confirmed by what our Saviour, after his resurrection, said of St.
   John, upon occasion of Peter's question concerning him, (John xxi. 21,
   22.) "Lord, what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will
   that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?" Upon which words of
   our Saviour concerning him, St. John himself adds, (ver. 23.) "Then
   went this saying abroad among the brethren, That that disciple should
   not die;" that is, that he should live till the coming of our Lord, and
   then be taken up with him into heaven: from all which, they probably
   (as they thought) concluded, that the day of judgment would happen
   before the end of that age, whilst St. John was alive: but St. John,
   who writ last of the evangelists (as Eusebius tells us), and lived
   until after the destruction of Jerusalem, as he acquaints us with this
   mistake, which was current among the Christians, so he takes care to
   rectify it, telling us, that "Jesus said not, He should not die; but,
   If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?" He tells
   us, that our Saviour did not affirm that "He should not die;" but, to
   repress St. Peter's curiosity, he says, "If it were my pleasure that he
   should not die at all, but live till I come to judgment, what is that
   to thee?" And St. Peter, likewise (or whoever was the author of this
   Second Epistle, or, at least, of this third chapter, which seems to be
   a new epistle by itself), takes notice of this mistake, about the
   nearness of the day of judgment, as that which gave occasion to these
   scoffers to deride the expectation of a future judgment among the
   Christians, because they had been already deceived about the time of
   it; and this the scoffers twitted them with in that question, "Where is
   the promise of his coming?" Therefore, the learned Grotius conjectures
   very probably, that this last epistle (contained in the third chapter)
   was written after the destruction of Jerusalem, which was the time
   fixed for Christ's coming to judgment; and, therefore, there could be
   no ground for this scoff until after that time. St. Peter, indeed, did
   not live so long; and therefore Grotius thinks, that this epistle was
   writ by Simeon, or Simon, who was successor of St. James in the
   bishopric of Jerusalem, and lived to the time of Trajan.

   I have been the longer in giving an account of this, that we might
   understand where the ground and force of this scoff lay; namely, in
   this, that because the Christians had generally been very confident,
   that the coming of Christ to judgment would be presently after the
   destruction of Jerusalem, and were now found to be deceived in that,
   therefore there was no regard to be had at all to their expectation of
   a future judgment; because they might be deceived in that as well as in
   the other.

   But herein they argued very falsely: because our Saviour had positively
   and peremptorily foretold his corning to judgment, but had never fixed
   and deter mined the time of it: nay, so far was he from that, that he
   had plainly told his disciples, that the precise time of the day of
   judgment God had reserved as a secret to himself, which he had not
   imparted to any, no, not to the angels in heaven, nor to the Son
   himself; (Mark xiii. 32, 33.) "But of that day and hour knoweth no man,
   no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the
   Father; take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when, the time
   is." So that if they presumed to make any conjectures about the time
   when the day of judgment would be, they did it without any warrant from
   our Lord: it was great presumption in them to determine the time of it,
   when our Saviour had so expressly told them, that the Father had
   reserved this as a secret, which he had never communicated to any; and,
   therefore, if they were mistaken about it, it was no wonder. But their
   mistake in this, was no prejudice to the truth of our Saviour's clear
   prediction of a future judgment, without any determination of the time
   of it, for that might be at some thousands of years distance, and yet
   be certain for all that; and the delay of it, was no sign of the
   uncertainty of our Saviour's prediction concerning it, but only of
   God's great patience and long-suffering to sinners, in expectation of
   their repentance; "God is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
   count slackness, but is long-suffering to us-ward." And this brings me
   to the

   Third and last particular in the text; namely, The true reason of God's
   patience and long-suffering to mankind: "He is long-suffering to
   us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come
   to repentance." And for this, St. Peter cites St. Paul: (ver. 15, of
   this chapter.) "And account that the long-suffering of the Lord is
   salvation;" that is, that the great end and design of God's goodness
   and long-suffering to sinners, is, that they may repent and be saved:
   "Account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation, even as our
   beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath
   written unto you." Now these words are not expressly found in St.
   Paul's writings: but the sense and effect of them is, (viz. in Rom. ii.
   4.) "Despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and
   long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
   repentance?" God hath a very gracious and merciful design in his
   patience to sinners: he is good, that he may make us so, and that his
   "goodness may lead us to repentance:" he defers punishment on purpose,
   that he may give men time to bethink themselves, and to return to a
   better mind; "He winks at the sins of men, that they may repent," says
   the son of Sirach. The patience of God aims at the cure and recovery of
   those who are not desperately and resolutely wicked.

   This is the primary end and intention of God's patience to sinners; and
   if he fail of this end, through our hardness and impenitency, he hath
   other ends, which he will infallibly attain: he will hereby glorify the
   riches of his mercy, and vindicate the righteousness of his justice;
   the damned in hell shall acknowledge, that the patience of God was
   great mercy and goodness to them, though they abused it; for God does
   not lose the glory of his patience, though we lose the benefit of it,
   and he will make it subservient to his justice, one way or other. Those
   great offenders whom he spares, after there are no hopes of their
   amendment, he, many times, makes use of, as instruments for the
   punishing of others, "as rods of his wrath, for the discipline of the
   world;" and he often reserves those who are incorrigibly bad, for a
   more remarkable ruin: but, however, they are reserved to the judgment
   of the great day; and if, after God hath exercised much patience
   towards sinners in this world, he inflicts punishment on them in the
   next, it must be acknowledged to be most just: for what can he do less,
   than to condemn those who would not be saved, and to make them
   miserable who so obstinately refused to be happy?

   Before I come to apply this discourse concerning the patience and
   long-suffering of God to sinners, I must remove an objection or two:

   I. The severity of God to some sinners in this life, and to all
   impenitent sinners in the next, seems to contradict what hath been said
   concerning God's patience and long-suffering.

   As for the severity of God towards impenitent sinners in the next life,
   this doth not at all contradict the patience of God; because the very
   nature of patience, and forbearance, and long-suffering, does suppose a
   determinate time, and that they will not last always: this life is the
   day of God's patience, and in the next world his justice and severity
   will take place. And, therefore, the punishment of sinners in another
   world, after God hath tried them in this, and expected their
   repentance, is no ways contrary to his patience and goodness, and very
   agreeable to his wisdom and justice; for it is no part of goodness to
   see itself perpetually abused; it is not patience, but stupidity and
   insensibleness, to endure to be always trampled upon, and to bear to
   have his holy and just laws for ever despised and contemned.

   And as for his severity to some sinners in this life--as to Lot's wife;
   to the Israelite that gathered sticks on the sabbath-day; to Nadab and
   Abihu; to Uzzah; to Ananias and Sapphira; and to Herod Agrippa--in all
   which instances God seems to have made quick work, and to have executed
   judgment speedily. To these I answer, that this severity of God to some
   few, doth rather magnify his patience to the rest of mankind; he may be
   severe to some few for example and warning to many, that they may learn
   to make better use of his patience, and not to trespass so boldly upon
   it; and, perhaps, he hath exercised much patience already towards those
   to whom at last he is so severe, as is plain in the case of Herod, and
   it may well be supposed in most of the other instances; or else the
   sin, so suddenly and severely punished, was very heinous and
   presumptuous, of a contagious and spreading nature, and of dangerous
   example. Lot's wife sinned most presumptuously against an express and
   an easy command, and whilst God was taking care of her deliverance in a
   very extraordinary manner. That of Nadab and Abihu, and of the man that
   gathered sticks on the sabbath-day, were presently after the giving of
   the law, in which case great severity is necessary; and that of Ananias
   and Sapphira, at the first publishing of the gospel, that the majesty
   of the Divine Spirit, and the authority of the first publishers of it,
   might not be contemned: that of Uzzah was upon the return of the ark of
   God from among the Philistines, that the people might not lose their
   reverence for it after it had been taken captive. So that these
   necessary severities to a few, in comparison of those many that are
   warned by them, are rather arguments of God's patience than objections
   against it.

   II. It is objected, That if God do not desire the ruin of sinners, but
   their repentance, whence comes it to pass that all are not brought to
   repentance? for who hath resisted his will? To this I answer:

   1. That there is no doubt but God is able to do this: he can, if he
   pleaseth, conquer and reclaim the most obstinate spirits; he is able
   out of "stones to raise up children unto Abraham:" and sometimes he
   exerts his omnipotence herein, as in the conversion of St. Paul, in a
   kind of violent and irresistible manner: but he hath no where declared
   that he will do this to all, and we see plainly, in experience, that he
   does not do it.

   2. God may very well be said, "not to be willing that any should
   perish, but that all should come to repentance," when he does, on his
   part, what is sufficient to that end; and upon this ground the
   Scripture every where represents God as desiring the repentance of
   sinners, and their obedience to his laws: (Deut. v. 29.) "O that there
   were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my
   commandments always, that it might be well with them!" So Jer. xiii.
   27. "O Jerusalem, wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?"
   (Isa. v. 3, 4.) We find God there solemnly appealing to the people of
   Israel, whether there had been any thing wanting on his part that was
   fit to be done: "And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah,
   judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard: what could have been
   done more to my vineyard that I have not done to it? wherefore when I
   looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild
   grapes?" God may justly look for the fruits of repentance and obedience
   from those to whom he affords a sufficiency of means to that end. And
   if so, then,

   3. The true reason why men do not repent, but perish, is because they
   are obstinate, and will not repent; and this account the Scripture
   every where gives of the impenitency of men, and the ruin consequent
   upon it: (Psal. lxxxi. 13.) "O that my people had hearkened unto me,
   and Israel had walked in my ways! But my people would not hearken to my
   voice, and Israel would none of me." (Ezek. xxxiii. 11.) "Why will ye
   die, O house of Israel?" (Prov. i. 2931.) "That they hated knowledge,
   and did not choose the fear of the Lord. They would none of my counsel;
   they despised all my reproof. Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of
   their own ways, and be filled with their own devices." The ruin of
   sinners doth not proceed from the counsel of God, but from their own
   choice. And so likewise our Saviour every where chargeth the ruin and
   destruction of the Jews upon their own wilful obstinacy.

   The inferences from this discourse concerning the patience and
   long-suffering of God towards man kind, shall be these three:

   I. To stir us up to a thankful acknowledgment of the great patience of
   God towards us, notwithstanding our manifold and heinous provocations.
   We may every one of us take to ourselves those words: (Lam. iii. 22.)
   "It is of the Lord's mercy that we are not consumed, because his
   compassions fail not." They are "renewed every morning." When ever we
   sin, (and "we provoke God every day") it is of his "patience that we
   are not destroyed:" and when we sin again, this is a new and greater
   instance of God's patience. The mercies of God's patience are no more
   to be numbered than our sins: we may say with David, "How great is the
   sum of them?" The goodness of God in sparing us is, in some respect,
   greater than his goodness in creating us; because he had no provocation
   not to make us, but we provoke him daily to destroy us.

   II. Let us propound the patience of God, for a pattern to ourselves.
   Plutarch says, "That God sets forth himself in the midst of the world
   for our imitation, and propounds to us the example of his patience, to
   teach us not to revenge injuries hastily upon one another."

   III. Let us comply with the design of God's patience and long-suffering
   towards us, which is "to bring us to repentance." Men are very apt to
   abuse it to a quite contrary purpose, to the encouraging themselves in
   their evil ways. So Solomon observes: (Eccl. viii. 11.) "Because
   sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the
   heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil." But this is
   very false reasoning; for the patience of God is an enemy to sin, as
   well as his justice; and the design of it is not to countenance sin,
   but to convert the sinner: (Rom. ii. 4.) "Despisest thou the riches of
   his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing that the
   goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?" Patience in God should
   produce repentance in us; and we should look upon it as an opportunity
   given us by God to repent and be saved: (2 Pet. iii. 15.) "Account that
   the long-suffering of God is salvation." They that do not improve the
   patience of God to their own salvation, mistake the true meaning and
   intent of it. But many are so far from making this use of it, that they
   presume upon it, and sin with more courage and confidence because of
   it; but that we may be sensible of the danger of this, I will offer
   these two or three considerations:

   1. That nothing is more provoking to God than the abuse of his
   patience. God's patience waits for our repentance; and all long
   attendance, even of inferiors upon their superiors, hath something in
   it that is grievous: how much more grievous and provoking must it be to
   the great God, after he hath laid out upon us all the riches of his
   goodness and long-suffering, to have that despised! after his patience
   hath waited a long time upon us, not only to be thrust away with
   contempt, but to have that which should be an argument to us to leave
   our sins, abused into an encouragement to continue in them! God takes
   an account of all the days of his patience and forbearance: (Luke xiii.
   7.) "Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree
   and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?"

   2. Consider that the patience of God will have an end. Though God
   suffers long, he will not suffer always; we may provoke God so long,
   until he can forbear no longer without injury and dishonour to his
   wisdom, and justice, and holiness; and God will not suffer one
   attribute to wrong the rest: his wisdom will determine the length of
   his patience; and when his patience is to no purpose, when there is no
   hopes of our amendment, his wisdom will then put a period to it; then
   the patience of his mercy will determine. "How often would I have
   gathered you, and you would not? therefore your house is left unto you
   desolate." And the patience of God's judgments will then determine.
   "Why should they be smitten any more? they will revolt more and more."
   Yea, patience itself, after a long and fruitless expectation, will
   expire. A sinner may continue so long impenitent, till the patience of
   God, as I may say, grows impenitent, and then our ruin will make haste,
   and destruction "will come upon us in a moment." If men will not come
   to repentance, "the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night,"
   as it follows in the next verse after the text; the judgment of God
   will suddenly surprise those who will not be gained by his patience.

   3. Consider that nothing will more hasten and aggravate our ruin than
   the abuse of God's patience. All this time of God's patience his wrath
   is coming towards us; and the more we presume upon it, the sooner it
   will overtake us: (Luke xii. 45, 46.) the wicked servant, who said his
   "lord delayed his coming," and fell to rioting and drunkenness; our
   Saviour tells us, that "the lord of that servant will come in a day
   when he looks not for him."

   And it will aggravate our ruin; the longer punishment is a coming, the
   heavier it will be: those things which are long in preparation are
   terrible in execution; the weight of God's wrath will make amends for
   the slowness of it; and the delay of judgment will be fully recompensed
   in the dreadfulness of it when it conies. Let all those consider this
   who go on in their sin, and are deaf to the voice of God's patience,
   which calls upon them every moment of their lives. There is a day of
   vengeance a coming upon those who trifle away this day of God's
   patience: nothing will sooner and more in flame the wrath and
   displeasure of God against us than his abused patience, and the
   despised riches of his goodness. As oil, though it be soft and smooth,
   yet, when it is once inflamed, burns most fiercely; so the patience of
   God, when it is abused, turns into fury; and his mildest attributes
   into the greatest severities.

   And if the patience of God do not bring us to repentance, it will but
   prepare us for a more intolerable ruin: after God hath kept a long
   indignation in his breast, it will, at length, break forth with the
   greater violence. The patience of God increaseth his judgments by an
   incredible kind of proportion; (Levit. xxvi. 18.) "And if you will
   still (says God to the people of Israel) walk contrary to me, and if ye
   will not be reformed by all these things, I will punish you yet seven
   times more." And, (verse 28.) "I will bring seven times more plagues
   upon you, according to your sins." At first God's justice accuseth
   sinners; but, after a long time of patience, his mercy comes in against
   us, and, instead of staying his hand, adds weight to his blows; (Rom.
   ix. 22.) "What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power
   known, endureth with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted
   for destruction?" They upon whom the patience of God hath no good
   effect, are "vessels of wrath, prepared and fitted for destruction." If
   ever God display his wrath, and make his anger known, he will do it in
   the most severe manner upon those who have despised and abused his
   patience; for these, in a more peculiar manner, "do treasure up for
   themselves wrath against the day of wrath, and the revelation of the
   righteous judgment of God."

   To conclude: Let us all take a review of our lives, and consider how
   long the patience of God hath waited upon us, and borne with us; with
   some twenty, forty, perhaps sixty years, and longer. Do we not remember
   how God spared us in such a danger, when we gave ourselves for lost?
   and how he recovered us in such a sickness, when the physician gave us
   up forgone? and what use have we made of this patience and
   long-suffering of God to wards us? It is the worst temper in the world
   not to be melted by kindness, not to be obliged by benefits, not to be
   tamed by gentle usage. He that is not wrought upon, neither by the
   patience of his mercy, nor by the patience of his judgments, his case
   is desperate, and past remedy. "Consider this, all ye that forget God,"
   lest his patience turn into fury; for "God is not slack, as some men
   count slackness; but long-suffering to sinners, not willing that any
   should perish, but that all should come to repentance."

SERMON CL.

  THE LONG-SUFFERING OF GOD.

   Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
   therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do
   evil.--Eccles. viii. 11.

   NOTHING is more evident, than that "the world lies in wickedness," and
   that iniquity every where abounds; and yet nothing is more certain,
   than that "God will not acquit the guilty," and let sin go unpunished.
   All men, excepting those who have offered notorious violence to the
   light of their own minds, and "have put the candle of the Lord, which
   is in them, "under a bushel," do believe that there is a God in the
   world, to whose holy nature and will sin is perfectly contrary, "who
   loves righteousness, and hates iniquity;" that "his eyes are upon the
   ways of man, and he seeth all his goings;" that "there is no darkness,
   nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide
   themselves." All men, except those whose consciences are seared, as it
   were, with a hot iron, are convinced of the difference of good and
   evil, and that it is not all one, whether men serve God or serve him
   not, do well or live wickedly. Every man from his inward sense and
   experience, is satisfied of his own liberty, and that God lays upon men
   no necessity of sinning, but that whenever we do amiss it is our own
   act, and we choose to do so; and sc far is he from giving the least
   countenance to sin that he hath given all imaginable discouragement to
   it, by the most severe and terrible threatenings, such as one would
   think sufficient to deter men for ever from it, and to drive it out of
   the world; and to make his threatenings the more awful and effectual,
   his providence hath not been wanting to give remarkable instances of
   his justice and severity upon notorious offenders, even in this life:
   and yet, for all this, men do, and will sin; nay, they are zealously
   set and bent upon it.

   Now here is the wonder; what it is that gives sinners such heart, and
   makes them so resolute and undaunted in so dangerous a course. Solomon
   gives us this account of it; because the punishments and judgments of
   God follow the sins of men so slowly, and are long before they overtake
   the sinner; Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
   speedily, therefore the hearts of the sons of men are fully set in them
   to do evil."

   The scope of the wise man's discourse is this; that, by reason of God's
   forbearance and long-suffering towards sinners in this life, it is not
   so easy to discern the difference between them and other men; his life
   is the day of God's patience, but the next will see a day of
   retribution and recompence. Now because God doth defer and moderate the
   punishment of sinners in this world, and reserve the weight of his
   judgments to the next; because, through the long-suffering of God, many
   great sinners live and die without any remarkable testimony of God's
   wrath and displeasure against them; "therefore the heart of the
   children of men are fully set in them to do evil."

   If we render the text word for word from the original, it runs thus;
   "Because nothing is done as a recompence to an evil work, therefore the
   heart of the sons of men are full in them to do evil;" that is, because
   men are not opposed and contradicted in their evil ways, because Divine
   justice doth not presently check and control sinners, because sentence
   is not immediately passed upon them, and judgment executed, "therefore
   the heart of the sons of men is full in them to do evil;" that is,
   therefore men grow bold and presumptuous in sin: for the Hebrew word
   which we render "is fully set in them," we find, (Esth. vii. 5.) where
   Ahasuerus says, concerning Haman, "Who is he? and where is he that
   durst presume in his heart to do so?" Whose heart was full to do so?
   Fervit in iis cor filiorum hominum; so some render it, "the hearts of
   men boil with wickedness;" are so full of it, that it works over. Men
   are resolute in an evil course, "their hearts are strengthened and
   hardened in them to do evil," so others translate the words. The
   translation of the LXX. is very emphatical, eplerophore'the kardi'a,
   "the heart of the sons of men is fully persuaded and assured to do
   evil." All these translations agree in the main scope and sense; viz.
   that sinners are very apt to presume upon the long-suffering of God,
   and to abuse it, to the hardening and encouraging of themselves in
   their evil ways. In the handling of this, I shall,

   First, Briefly shew that it is so.

   Secondly, Whence this comes to pass, and upon what pretences and
   colours of reason, men encourage themselves in sin from the patience of
   God.

   Thirdly, I shall endeavour to answer an objection about this matter.

   First, That men are very apt to abuse the long suffering of God, to the
   encouraging and hardening of themselves in an evil course, the
   experience of the world, in all ages, does give abundant testimony.
   Thus it was with the old world, "when the long-suffering of God waited
   in the days of Noah, while he was preparing an ark, for the space of a
   hundred and twenty years," (1 Pet. iii. 20.) For the wickedness of man,
   which was great upon the earth, a general deluge was threatened: but
   God was patient, and delayed his judgment a great while: hereupon they
   grew secure in their impenitency, and went on in their course, as if
   they had no apprehension of danger, no fear of the judgment threatened.
   So our Saviour tells us: (Matt. xxiv. 38, 39.) "As in the days that
   were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and
   giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and
   knew not until the flood came, and took them all away." And so it was
   with Sodom: (Luke xvii. 28.) and "likewise also as it was in the days
   of Lot, they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted,
   they built." And so, our Saviour tells us, it will be in the end of the
   world; "Even thus shall it be in the lay when the Son of man is
   revealed." So likewise the apostle St. Paul, (Rom. ii. 4, 5.)
   "Despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and
   long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
   repentance? But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up
   to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and the revelation of the
   righteous judgment of God." The goodness and long-suffering of God,
   which ought in all reason to lead men to repentance, is to many an
   occasion of greater hardness and impenitency. So also St. Peter
   foretels, (2 Pet. iii. 3.) "That in the last lays there should come
   scoffers, who should walk after their own hearts' lusts, saying, Where
   is the promise of his coming?" And we see, in daily experience, that
   the greatest part of sinners grow more obstinate and confirmed in their
   wicked ways, upon account of God's patience, and because he delays the
   punishment due to them for their sins. Let us consider, in the

   Second place, Whence this comes to pass, and upon what pretence and
   colour of reason men encourage themselves in sin, from the
   long-suffering of God. And there is no doubt but this proceed? from our
   ignorance and inconsiderateness, and from an evil heart of unbelief,
   from the temptation and suggestion of the devil, one of whose great
   arts it is, to make men question the threatenings of God and to
   insinuate, as he did to our first parents either that he hath not
   denounced such threatenings, or that he will not execute them so
   severely. All these causes do concur to the producing this monstrous
   effect: but that which I design to inquire into, is, from what pretence
   of reason, grounded upon the long-suffering of God, sinners argue
   themselves into this confidence and presumption For when the wise man
   saith, that "because sentence against an evil work is not executed
   speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to
   do evil;" he does not intend to insinuate that God's long-suffering
   fills the hearts of men with wicked designs and resolutions, and does,
   by a proper and direct efficacy, harden sinners in their course; but
   that wicked men, upon some account or other, do take occasion, from the
   long-suffering of God, to harden themselves in sin; they draw false
   conclusions from it to impose upon themselves, as if it were really a
   ground of encouragement; they think they see something in the
   forbearance of God, and his delay of punishment, which makes them hope
   for impunity in an evil course, notwithstanding the threatenings of
   God.

   And, therefore, I shall endeavour to shew, what those false conclusions
   are, which wicked men draw from the delay of punishment, and to
   discover the sophistry and fallacy of them; and I shall rank them under
   two heads; those which are more gross and atheistical; and those which
   are not so gross, but yet more common and frequent.

   I. Those conclusions which are more gross and atheistical, which bad
   men draw to the hardening and encouraging of themselves in sin, from
   the delay of punishment (which we, who believe a God, call the patience
   or long-suffering of God), are these three: either that there is no
   God; or, if there be, that there is no providence; or that there is no
   difference between good and evil.

   I shall speak more briefly of these, because I hope there are but few
   in the world of such irregular and besotted understandings, as to make
   such inferences as these, from the delay of punishment.

   1st, From hence some would fain conclude, that there is no God. That
   some are so absurd as to reason in this manner, the Scripture tells us,
   (Psal. xiv. 1.) "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God: they
   are corrupt, and have done abominable works." Now the argument that
   these men frame to themselves is this; God doth not take a speedy
   course with sinners, and revenge himself immediately upon the workers
   of iniquity, therefore there is no God; for if there were, he would
   shew himself, and not bear the affronts of sinners, when it is so easy
   for him to vindicate himself by a swift and speedy vengeance. Thus the
   poet represents the atheist arguing; Nullos esse deos, inane cælum,
   affirmat Selius, probatque, quod se factum, dum negat hoc, videt
   beatum. "Selius affirms, there are no gods, and that heaven is an empty
   place, and proves it, because, whilst he denies God, he sees himself in
   a very happy and prosperous condition."

   And here it is worthy our notice, at what a contradictious rate these
   men reason. First, They would have no God, lest he should be just, and
   punish them as they deserve; and then, in another mood, they would have
   him to be nothing but justice and severity, lest there should be a God:
   as if no other notion could be framed of the Divine nature, but of a
   rash fury, and impetuous revenge, and an impotent passion, which, when
   it is offended and provoked, cannot contain itself, and forbear
   punishment for a moment. Justice is not such a perfection as doth
   necessarily exclude wisdom, and goodness, and patience; it doth in no
   wise contradict the perfection of the Divine nature to bear with
   sinners, in expectation of their repentance and amendment; or if God
   foresees their final impenitency, to respite their punishment to the
   most fit and convenient season. God may suffer long, and yet be
   resolved, if sinners persist in the abuse of his goodness and patience,
   to execute vengeance upon them in due time. It is a pitiful ground of
   atheism, that because God is so much better than wicked men deserve,
   they will not allow him to be at all.

   2dly, Others infer from the delay of punishment, that there is no
   providence that administers the affairs of the world, and regards the
   good and bad actions of men. For though the being of God be
   acknowledged, yet, if he do not regard what is done here below, nor
   concern himself in human affairs, sinners are as safe and free to do
   what they please, as if there were no God; and upon this ground, the
   Scripture tells us, many encourage themselves in their wickedness;
   (Psal. lxiv. 5.) "They encourage themselves in an evil matter; they
   commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?" And
   more expressly, (Psal. xciv. 4-7.) "How long shall they utter and speak
   hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? They
   break in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage. They
   slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Yet they
   say, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it."
   And if this were so, well might they encourage themselves. If it were
   true which Epicurus saith, "That God takes no knowledge of the actions
   of men; that he is far removed from us, and contented with himself, and
   not at all concerned in what we do:" if this were true, the inference
   which Lucretius makes were very just; Quare religio pedibus subjecta
   vicissim obteritur; "Men might trample religion under their feet, and
   live without any regard to the laws of it."

   But let us see how they infer this from the long-suffering of God, that
   he neglects the affairs of the world, and hath no consideration of the
   actions of men, because they see the ungodly to prosper in the world
   equally with others that are strictly devout and virtuous, yea, many
   times to be in a more prosperous and flourishing condition; "they are
   not in trouble like other men, neither are they plagued like other
   men." So that if there be a God, it seems (say they) that he connives
   at the crimes of men, and "looks on upon them that deal treacherously,
   and holds his peace whilst the wicked devoureth the man that is more
   righteous than himself," as the prophet expresseth it, (Habak. i. 13.)

   For answer to this, I shall only give this reason able and credible
   account of the long-suffering of God, and the impunity of wicked men in
   this life, which not only the Scripture gives us, but the heathen were
   able to give from the light of nature, and is agreeable to the common
   sense of mankind; namely, that this life is a state of probation and
   trial, wherein God suffers men to walk in their own ways without any
   visible check and restraint, and does not usually inflict present and
   remarkable punishments upon them for their evil deeds; because this,
   being a state of trial of the dispositions and manners of men, is
   rather the proper season of patience, than of punishments and rewards;
   and therefore it is very reasonable to suppose that God reserves
   sinners for a solemn and public trial at the great assizes of the
   world, when he will openly vindicate the honour of his justice upon the
   despisers of his patience and long-suffering, when he will make "his
   judgment to break forth as the light, and his righteousness as the
   noon-day." In the mean time, the providence of God, when he sees it
   fit, gives some remarkable instances of his justice upon great and
   notorious offenders in this life, as a pledge and earnest of a future
   judgment; and these, sometimes, more general, as in the destruction of
   the old world by an universal deluge, when "he saw the wickedness of
   men to be great upon the earth:" and such was that terrible vengeance
   which was poured down upon Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about
   them; which, as St. Jude tells us, "are set forth for an example,
   suffering the vengeance of eternal fire," that is, of a perpetual
   destruction by fire.

   3dly, Another gross and atheistical inference, which men are apt to
   make from the delay of punishment; is, that there is no such difference
   of good and evil as is pretended; because they do not see the good and
   bad actions of men differenced in their rewards; because Divine justice
   doth not presently manifest itself; and every transgression and
   disobedience doth not immediately receive a just recompence of reward,
   therefore they cannot believe that the difference between good and evil
   is so great and evident.

   For answer to this: not to insist upon the difference which the
   providence of God sometimes makes between them in this life, I appeal
   to the consciences of men, whether they do not secretly and inwardly
   acknowledge a clear difference between good and evil. Are not the worst
   of men apt to conceive better hopes of success, when they are about a
   just and honest undertaking, than when they are engaged in a wicked
   design? Do not bad men feel a secret shame and horror, when no eye sees
   them, and the wickedness they are about to commit doth not fall under
   the cognizance and censure of any human court or tribunal? Have they
   not many checks and rebukes in their own spirits, much disturbance and
   confusion of mind, when they are enterprising a wicked thing? And does
   not this plainly argue, that they are guilty to themselves, that they
   are about something which they ought not to do?

   It is very true, that most men are more sensible of the evil of an
   action, when they feel the ill effects and consequences of it, and
   suffer the punishment that is due to it: but yet the sense of good and
   evil is so deeply impressed upon human nature, that I think no man,
   remaining a man, can quite deface and blot out the difference of good
   and evil. So that if men will but attend to the natural dictates and
   suggestions of their own minds, they cannot possibly infer, from the
   delay of punishment, that there is no difference of good and evil.

   But because those who are thus are but few, in comparison, there being
   not many in the world arrived to that degree of blindness, and height
   of impiety, as to disbelieve a God and a providence; and I think none
   have attained to that perfect conquest of conscience, as to have lost
   all sense of good and evil; therefore I shall rather insist,

   II. Upon those kind of reasonings which are more ordinary and common
   among bad men, and whereby they cheat themselves into everlasting
   perdition; and they are such as these:

   1. Because sentence against an evil work is not speedily executed,
   therefore sin is not so great an evil.

   2. Therefore God is not so highly offended and provoked by it. Or,

   3. God is not so severe in his own nature, as he is commonly
   represented.

   4. Therefore the punishment of sin is not so certain. Or, however,

   5. It is at a distance, and may be prevented time enough, by a future
   repentance in our old age, or at the hour of death. By some such false
   reasonings as these, which men think may probably be collected from the
   patience and long-suffering of God, they harden and encourage
   themselves in an evil course.

   1. Because the punishment of sin is deferred, therefore they conclude
   it is not so great an evil; they do not feel the ill effects of it at
   present; all things go well and prosperously with them, no less than
   with those who are so strict and conscientious; and therefore they hope
   there is no such great evil in sin, as melancholy people are apt to
   fancy to themselves. For answer to this,

   (1.) Consider seriously what sin is, and then thou wilt see reason
   enough to call it a great evil. To sin. against God, is to contemn the
   greatest authority in the world, to contradict the greatest holiness
   and purity, to abuse the greatest goodness, and to provoke almighty
   justice to take vengeance upon thee, and to make thee as miserable as
   thou art capable of being. To sin against God, is to be disobedient to
   thy sovereign, and unthankful to thy best benefactor, and to act
   contrary to the greatest obligations, against thy best reason and
   truest interest; to disoblige thy kindest friend, and to gratify thy
   worst and bitterest enemy: it is to disorder thyself, to create
   perpetual disquiet to thy own mind, and to do the greatest mischief
   possible to thyself; to deprive thyself of the greatest happiness, and
   to draw down upon thyself extreme and eternal misery. And what do we
   call a great evil if this be not, which contains in it all the kinds
   and all the aggravations of evil that can be, and hath all the
   circumstances of ugliness and deformity in it that can be imagined?

   (2.) Whatever sin be in itself, yet from hence we can in no wise
   conclude that it is not a great evil, because the punishment of it is
   deferred for a while: from hence, indeed, it follows, that God is very
   good in deferring the punishment which is due to thee for thy sins, but
   by no means that sin is not very evil. The reprieve of a traitor does,
   indeed, argue the goodness and clemency of the prince, but doth not at
   all abate of the heinousness of the crime for which he is sentenced.
   The great evil of sin is evident, because the holy and just God hath
   for bidden it, and declared his hatred and detestation of it, and
   threatened it with most severe and direful punishment; but that God
   respites the punishment which is due to sin, and does not immediately
   take vengeance upon sinners, but affords them a space, and means, and
   opportunity of repentance, this doth not at all lessen the evil of sin,
   but is rather an aggravation of it, that we should offend and provoke
   that God who is so patient and long-suffering towards us, so very loath
   to bring those evils upon us, which we are so rash and forward to pull
   down upon ourselves.

   2. If God doth not immediately punish sin upon the commission of it,
   and instantly let fly at the sinner, this they would construe to be a
   sign that he is not so highly offended and provoked by it; if he were,
   he would manifest his displeasure against it, by the sudden and violent
   effusions of his wrath. For answer to this, I desire these two things
   may be considered:

   (1.) That God himself, in his word, every where plainly declares to us
   his great displeasure against sin: (Psal. v. 4, 5.) "Thou art not a God
   that hast pleasure in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with thee.
   The foolish shall not stand in thy sight; thou hatest all the workers
   of iniquity." "Thou art not a God that hast pleasure in wickedness."
   The words are a mei'osis, and less is spoken than is meant and
   intended; viz. that God is so far from taking pleasure in the sins of
   men, that he is highly displeased at them, and bears an implacable
   hatred against them.

   And do not the terrible threatenings of God against sin declare him to
   be highly offended at it, when he says, "that he will come in flaming
   fire to render vengeance to all them that know not the gospel" of his
   Son; and that they "shall be punished with everlasting destruction,
   from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power?" Can we
   think that all the threatenings of God's word, and all those direful
   curses which are written in his book, shall return empty, without doing
   any execution? Thou that now flatterest thyself in vain and groundless
   hopes, that none of these evils shall come upon thee, when thou comest
   to stand before the great Judge of the world, and to behold the killing
   frowns of his countenance, and to hear those bitter words of eternal
   displeasure from the mouth of God himself, "Depart, ye cursed, into
   everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;" thou wilt
   then believe that God is heartily angry and offended with thee for thy
   sins. We shall find in that day, that the threatenings of God's word,
   which we now hear securely, and without terror, had a full
   signification; or rather, that no words could convey to us the terror
   of them. What the Scripture says of the happiness and glory of the next
   life, is true also of the misery and punishments of the other world,
   that "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the
   heart of man, those terrible things which God hath reserved for the
   workers of iniquity."

   But, above all, the direful sufferings of the Son of God, when sin was
   but imputed to him, are a demonstration of God's implacable hatred of
   sin; for that rather than sin should go unpunished, God was pleased to
   subject his own Son to the sufferings due to it: this plainly shews
   that he hated sin, as much as he loved his own Son.

   But, (2dly,) God may conceive a very great displeasure against sin, and
   be highly incensed and provoked by it, and yet suspend the effects of
   his displeasure, and defer the punishment of it for a great while: and
   to imagine other wise, argues a gross mistake of the nature of God,
   arising from our not considering the attributes and perfections of God
   in conjunction and consistency with one another. When we consider one
   attribute of God singly, and separate it from the rest, and frame such
   wide and large apprehensions of it, as to exclude his other
   perfections, we have a false notion of God; and the reason of this
   mistake is, because among men, an eminent degree of any one excellency
   doth commonly shut out others; because, in our narrow and finite
   nature, many perfections cannot stand together; but it is quite
   otherwise in the Divine nature. In infinite perfection, all perfections
   do meet and consist together; one perfection doth not hinder and
   exclude another; and therefore, in our conceptions of God, we are to
   take great heed that we do not raise any one attribute or perfection of
   God upon the ruin of the rest.

   So that it is a false imagination of God, when we so attribute justice
   or anger to him, as to exclude his patience and long-suffering: for God
   is not impotent in his anger, as we are; every thing that provokes him,
   doth not presently put him out of patience, so that he cannot contain
   his wrath, and for bear immediately to revenge himself upon sinners. In
   this sense, God says of himself, (Isa. xxvii. 4.) "Fury is not in me."
   There is nothing of a rash and ungoverned passion in the wise and just
   God. Every sin, indeed, kindles his anger, and provokes his displeasure
   against us, and, by our repeated and continued offences, we still add
   fuel to his wrath; but it doth not of necessity instantly break forth
   like a consuming fire, and a devouring flame. The holy and righteous
   nature of God, makes him necessarily offended and displeased with the
   sins of men; but as to the manifestation of his wrath, and the effects
   of his anger, his wisdom and goodness do regulate and determine the
   proper time and circumstances of punishment.

   3. From the patience of God, and the delay of punishment, men are apt
   to conclude, that God is not so severe in his nature as he is commonly
   represented. It is true, he hath declared his displeasure against sin,
   and threatened it with dreadful punishments; which he may do, in great
   wisdom, to keep the world in awe and order: but great things are
   likewise spoken of his mercy, and of the wonderful delight he takes in
   the exercise of his mercy: so that, notwithstanding all the
   threatenings which ire denounced against sin, it is to be hoped, that
   when sentences come to be passed, and judgment to be executed, God will
   remember mercy in the midst of judgment, and that mercy will triumph
   over judgment; and that, as now his patience stays his hand, and turns
   away his wrath, so, at the last, the milder attributes of his goodness
   and mercy will interpose and moderate the vigour and severity of his
   justice; and of this, his great patience and long-suffering towards
   sinners for the present, seems to be some kind of pledge and earnest:
   he that is so slow to anger, and so loath to execute punishment, may
   probably be prevailed upon, by his own pity and goodness, to remit it
   at the last: and this is the more credible, because it is granted on
   all hands, that no person is obliged to execute his threatenings, as he
   is to make good his promises: he that promiseth, passeth a right to an
   other; but he that threateneth, keeps the right and power of doing what
   he pleaseth in his own hands.

   I shall speak a little more fully to this, because it is almost
   incredible how much men bear up themselves upon vain and groundless
   hopes of the boundless mercy of God, and "bless themselves in their
   hearts, saying, they shall have peace, though they walk in the
   imagination of their hearts, to add drunkenness to thirst;" that is,
   though they still persist in their vices, and add one degree of sin to
   another.

   Now, for answer to this,

   (1.) Let it be granted, that a bare threatening does not necessarily
   infer the certainty of the event; and that the thing threatened shall
   infallibly come to pass: no person is obliged to perform his
   threatenings, as he is his promises; the threatenings of God declare
   what sin deserves, and what the sinner may justly expect, if he
   continue impenitent and incorrigible. But then we are to take notice,
   that repentance is the only condition that is implied in the
   threatenings of God, and will effectually hinder the execution of them:
   (Jer. xviii. 7-10.) "At what instant I speak (says God) concerning a
   nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to
   destroy it; if that nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from
   their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.
   And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a
   kingdom, to build and to plant it; if it do evil in my sight, and obey
   not my voice, then will I repent of the good wherewith I said I would
   benefit them." Now if, when God hath promised to do good to a people,
   sin will hinder the blessing promised, and bring down judgments upon
   them, much more when it is particularly threatened.

   But as to the case of final impenitency and unbelief, God, that he
   might strengthen his threatenings, hath added a sign of immutability to
   them, having confirmed them with an oath; "I have sworn (saith the
   Lord) that they shall not enter into my rest:" which, though it was
   spoken to the unbelieving Jews, the apostle to the Hebrews applies it
   to a final unbelief and impenitency under the gospel, of which the
   infidelity of the Israelites was a type and figure. Now, though God may
   remit of his threatenings, yet his oath is a plain declaration that he
   will not; because it signifies, the firm and immutable determination of
   his will, and thereby puts an end to all doubts and controversies
   concerning the fulfilling of his threatenings.

   (2.) It is certainly much the wisest and safest way to believe the
   threatenings of God in the strictness and rigour of them, unless there
   be some tacit condition evidently implied in them; because if we do not
   believe them, and the thing prove otherwise, the consequence of our
   mistake is fatal and dreadful. It is true, indeed, that God, by his
   threatenings, did intend to keep sinners in awe, and to deter them from
   sin: but if he had any where revealed, that he would not be rigorous in
   the execution of these threatenings, such a revelation would quite take
   off the edge and terror of them, and contradict the end and design of
   them; for threatenings signify very little, but upon this supposition,
   that, in all probability, they will be executed: and if this be true,
   it is the greatest madness and folly in the world to run the hazard of
   it.

   (3.) As for those large declarations which the Scripture makes of the
   boundless mercy of God to sinners, we are to limit them, as the
   Scripture hath done, to the time and season of mercy, which is this
   life, and while we are in the way. This is the day of mercy and
   salvation; and when this life is ended, the opportunities of grace and
   mercy are past, and "the day of recompence and vengeance" will begin.
   Now God tries us, and offers mercy to us; but if we obstinately refuse
   it, judgment will take hold of us.

   And then we must limit the mercy of God to the conditions upon which he
   offers it, which are, repentance for sins past, and sincere obedience
   for the future: but if men continue obstinate and impenitent, and
   encourage themselves in sin, from the mercy and patience of God; this
   is not a case that admits of mercy, but, on the contrary, his justice
   will triumph in the ruin and destruction of those who, instead of
   embracing the offers of his mercy, do despise and abuse them: "He will
   laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear comes; when their
   fear comes as desolation, and their destruction as a whirlwind; when
   distress and anguish cometh upon them, then they" may "call upon him,
   but he will not answer; they" may "seek him early, but they shall not
   find him." If we "despise the riches of God's goodness, and
   long-suffering, and forbearance," he knows how to handle us, and will
   do it to purpose; "with the froward he will shew himself froward," and
   will be, in a more especial manner, severe towards those who take
   encouragement from his mercy, to disbelieve and despise his
   threatenings. And this God hath as plainly told us, as words can
   express any thing: (Deut. xxix. 19, 20.) "And if it come to pass, that
   when he heareth the words of this curse, he bless himself in his heart,
   saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my
   heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: the Lord will not spare him, but
   then the anger of the Lord, and his jealousy, shall smoke against that
   man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon
   him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven." Whatever
   might and power God hath reserved to himself about the execution of his
   threatenings, he hath plainly declared, that, of all others, those who
   encourage themselves in a sinful course, from the hopes of God's mercy,
   notwithstanding his threatenings, shall find no favour and mercy at his
   hand: whatever he may remit of his threatenings to others, he will
   certainly not spare those who believe so largely concerning the mercy
   of God, not with a mind to submit to the terms of it, but to presume so
   much the more upon it.

   (4.) God hath not been wanting to shew some remarkable instances of his
   severity towards sinners in this world. As he is pleased sometimes to
   give good men some foretastes of heaven, and earnests of their future
   happiness; so likewise, by some present stroke, to let sinners feel
   what they are to expect hereafter; some sparks of hell do now and then
   fall upon the consciences of sinners. That fear which is sometimes
   kindled in men's consciences in this life, that horrible anguish, and
   those unspeakable terrors which some sinners have had experience of in
   this world, may serve to forewarn us of "the wrath which is to come,"
   and to convince us of the reality of those expressions of the torments
   of hell, by "the worm that dies not, and the fire that is not
   quenched." That miraculous deluge, which swallowed up the old world;
   that hell which was rained down from heaven in those terrible showers
   of fire and brimstone, to consume Sodom and Gomorrah: the earth opening
   her mouth upon Corah and his seditious company, to let them down, as it
   were, quick into hell: these, and many other remarkable judgments of
   God, in several ages, upon particular persons, and upon cities and
   nations, may satisfy us, in some measure, of the severity of God
   against sin, and be, as it were, pledges to assure sinners of the
   insupportable misery and torments of the next life.

   (5.) The argument is much stronger the other way, that because the
   punishment of sinners is delayed so long, therefore it will be much
   heavier and severer when it comes; that the wrath of God is growing all
   this while, and as we fill up the measures of our sins, he fills the
   phial of his wrath (Rom. ii. 5.) "And according to thy hard and
   impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of
   wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God." God now
   keeps in his displeasure; but all the while we go on in an impenitent
   course, the wrath of God is continually increasing and will at last be
   manifested by the righteous judgment of God upon sinners. God now
   exerciseth and displayeth his milder attributes, his goodness, and
   mercy, and patience; but these will not always hold out: there is a
   dreadful day a coming, wherein (as the apostle speaks) God will "shew
   his wrath and make his power known," after he hath "endured with much
   long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction." All this
   long time of God's patience and forbearance his wrath is kindling, and
   he is whetting his glittering sword, and making sharp his arrows; and
   this long preparation doth portend a much more dreadful execution; so
   that we should reason thus, from the long-suffering of God--God bears
   with us, and spares us at present, and keeps in his anger; therefore if
   we go on to provoke him, time will come when he will not spare, but his
   anger will flame forth, and his jealousy smoke against us. This is but
   reasonable to expect, that they who in this world forsake their own
   mercies, the mercy of God in the next should forsake them.

   4. Another false conclusion, which men draw from the delay of
   punishment, is, that because it is delayed, therefore it is not so
   certain: the sinner escapes for the present; and though he have some
   misgivings and fearful apprehensions of the future, yet he hopes his
   fears may be greater than his danger.

   It is true, indeed, we are not so certain of the misery of wicked men
   in another world, as if it were present, and we lay groaning under the
   weight of it: such a certainty as this, would not only leave no place
   for doubting, but even for that which we properly and strictly call
   faith; for "faith is the evidence of things not seen:" but sure we have
   other faculties besides sense to judge of things by; we may be
   sufficiently certain of many things which are neither present nor
   sensible, of many things past and future, upon good ground and
   testimony: we are sure that we were born, and yet we have no
   remembrance of it; we are certain that we shall die, though we never
   had the experience of it. Things may be certain in their causes, as
   well as in their present existence, if the causes be certain. The truth
   of God, who hath declared these things to us, is an abundant ground of
   assurance to us, though they be at a great distance: the certainty of
   things is not shaken by our wavering belief concerning them.

   Besides, the very light of nature, and the common reason of mankind,
   hath always made a contrary inference from the long-suffering of God,
   and the delay of present punishment. Though men are apt to think, that
   because judgment is deferred, therefore it is not certain, yet the very
   light of nature hath taught men to reason otherwise; that because God
   is so patient to sinners in this life, therefore there will a time come
   when they shall be punished; that because this life is a time of trial
   and forbearance, therefore there shall be another state after this
   life, which shall be a season of recompence. And by this argument
   chiefly it was, that the wisest of the heathen satisfied themselves
   concerning another state after this life, and answered the troublesome
   objection against the providence of God, from the unequal
   administration of things in the world, so visible in the afflictions
   and sufferings of good men, and the prosperity of the wicked; viz. that
   there would be another state that would adjust all these matters, and
   set them straight, when good and bad men should receive the full
   recompence of their deeds.

   The 5th and last false conclusion which men draw from the
   long-suffering of God, and the delay of punishment, is this; That it
   is, however, probably, at some distance, and therefore they may sin yet
   a while longer, and all this danger may be prevented time enough, by a
   future repentance in our old age, or at the hour of death; and they are
   confirmed very much in this hope, because they see men much worse than
   themselves, great criminals and malefactors, upon two or three days
   warning, to perform this work of repentance very substantially, and to
   die with great comfort and assurance of their salvation. This is the
   most common delusion of all the rest, and hath been, I am afraid, the
   ruin of more souls than all the other which I have mentioned; they may
   have slain their thousands, but this its ten thousands.

   For answer to this, be pleased seriously to lay to heart these
   following considerations, most of which I shall speak but briefly to;
   because I have, upon other occasions, spoken largely to them.

   (1.) If there be a future judgment, then it is certain, at how great a
   distance soever it may be. That which shall be a thousand years hence,
   will certainly be; and it is but very small comfort and encouragement,
   considering the vast disproportion between time and eternity, to think,
   that after twenty or forty years shall be past and gone, then must I
   enter upon eternal misery; then will those intolerable torments begin,
   which shall never have an end.

   (2.) But it is not certain that it is at such a distance: when we "put
   from us the evil clay," it is, many times, nearer to us than we are
   aware; and when we think the judgment of God is at a great distance,
   the Judge may be near, even at the door. Our times are not in our own
   hands, but we are perfectly at the disposal of another, who, when he
   pleaseth, can put a period to them, and cause our breath to cease from
   our nostrils, and we shall not be: "There is no man hath power over the
   spirit, to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of
   death," saith the wise man, a little before the text. Thou dreamest,
   perhaps, of many years continuance in this world, and, perhaps, in the
   height of this vain imagination, "the decree is sealed, and the
   commandment come forth" to summon thee out of this world, and thou art
   just dropping into that misery, which thou fanciest to be at such a
   distance; whilst thou art vainly promising thyself the ease of many
   years, God may say to thee, "Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be
   required of thee;" and then, where are all thy hopes?

   (3.) Supposing the evil day were at a considerable distance, yet men
   run an infinite hazard in venturing all the hopes of their salvation
   upon a future repentance: for what knowest thou, O man! but thou mayest
   be surprised by a sudden stroke, which may give thee no warning, leave
   thee no space of repentance? A violent disease may seize upon thee,
   which may disorder thy understanding, and so weaken all thy faculties,
   as to render thee unfit for all reason able operations: at the best how
   unfit are we for the most serious work of our lives, when we are hardly
   lit to do any thing? Old age is a very unseasonable time for
   repentance, when we are full of weakness and infirmity, and our minds
   are crooked and bowed down by vice, as our bodies are by age, and as
   hard to be recovered to their first straightness; much more is it an
   improper time for this work, when sickness and old age meet together.
   There are two things in which men, in other things wise enough, do
   usually miscarry; in putting off the making of their wills, and their
   repentance, until it be too late. Men had need then be of sound
   understanding, and perfect memory, when they set about matters of so
   great consequence in respect of their temporal and eternal
   concernments: especially, when men have the happiness of all eternity
   to take care of and provide for, they had need have their
   understandings about them, and all the advantages of leisure and
   consideration, to make a sober reflection upon their past lives, and
   make up their accounts with God, and to set all things right between
   him and them; and it is well if, after all, a repentance wilfully
   deferred so long, so short and imperfect, so confused and huddled up,
   will at last be accepted as a tolerable atonement for the crimes and
   miscarriages of a long life.

   (4.) Suppose thou wert sure to repent before thou leavest the world,
   and to do this work thoroughly, which no man can promise to himself,
   that deliberately delays it; yet this can be no reasonable
   encouragement to go on in an evil course, because we do but hereby
   aggravate our own trouble, and treasure up much more sorrow and
   affliction to ourselves against the day of repentance, and consequently
   sin on, in hopes of being hereafter so much the more troubled and
   grieved for what we have done; as if a man should go on to break the
   laws, in hopes of a more severe and exemplary punishment: sure this can
   be no encouragement or ground of hope to any reasonable and considerate
   man.

   Lastly, As to the encouragement which men take from the sudden
   repentance of great criminals and malefactors, and their dying with so
   much comfort and assurance; if this be well considered, there is little
   comfort to be fetched from such examples. For,

   1st, Though a sincere repentance in such circum stances be possible;
   yet it is almost impossible for the party himself concerned, much more
   for others, upon any good ground, to judge when it is sincere. God, who
   knows the hearts of men, and whether, if they had lived longer, they
   would, in the future course of their lives, have justified and made
   good their repentance and good resolutions, only knows the sincerity of
   it.

   But, 2dly, No certain judgment is to be made for the comfort and
   confidence of the party concerned; for the business is not what comfort
   and confidence men have, but what ground they have for it; and whereas
   men are apt piously to suppose that so extraordinary a comfort and
   assurance is wrought in them by the Spirit of God, nothing is more
   uncertain: because we sometimes see those who give no such testimony of
   their repentance, to die with every whit as much courage, and comfort,
   and confident persuasion of their salvation, as those that do. But
   this, certainly, is not from the Spirit of God: a natural obstinacy and
   courage may carry men a great way; and false and mistaken principles
   may fill men, for the present, with as much comfort and confidence as
   well-grounded hopes. In the church of Rome, great numbers of those who
   have led very wicked lives, after a formal confession and absolution,
   and some good words of encouragement from the priest, die as full of
   peace and comfort, to all appearance, as the best of men.

   Indeed, it is very natural to men who find themselves in a desperate
   condition to be strangely elevated and raised, upon any hopes of
   escaping so great a danger as they apprehend themselves to be in;
   especially if these hopes be given them by a grave man, of whose piety
   and judgment they have a venerable opinion. When men have the sentence
   of death in themselves, as all wicked livers must have, they are
   naturally apt to be overjoyed at the unexpected news of a pardon.

   To speak my mind freely in this matter, I have no great opinion of that
   extraordinary comfort and confidence which some have, upon a sudden
   repentance, for great and flagrant crimes; because I cannot discern any
   sufficient ground for it. I think great humility and dejection of mind,
   and a doubtful apprehension of their condition, next almost to a
   despair of it, would much better become them; because their case is
   really so very doubtful in itself. There is great reason for the
   repentance of such persons, and it becomes them well; but I see very
   little reason for their great comfort and confidence, nor does it
   become their circumstances and condition. Let them exercise as deep
   repentance as is possible, and "bring forth all the fruits meet for it"
   that are possible in so short a time: let them humble themselves before
   God, and pray incessantly to him, day and night, for mercy; make all
   the reparation they can, for the injuries they have done, by
   confession, and acknowledgment, and by making satisfaction to the
   parties injured, if it be in their power; by giving alms to the poor;
   by warning others, and endeavouring to reclaim them to a better mind,
   and course of life; and for the rest, humbly commit themselves to the
   mercy of God, in Jesus Christ: let them imitate, as near as they can,
   the behaviour of the penitent thief, the only example the Scripture has
   left us of a late repentance that proved effectual, who gave the
   greatest testimony that could be of a penitent sorrow for his sins, and
   of his faith in the Saviour of the world, by a generous and courageous
   owning of him in the midst of his disgrace and suffering, when even his
   own disciples had denied and forsaken him: but we do not find in him
   any signs of extraordinary comfort, much less of confidence, but he
   humbly commended himself to the mercy and goodness of his Saviour,
   saying, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."

SERMON CLI.

  THE LONG-SUFFERING OF GOD.

   Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
   therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do
   evil.--Eccles. viii. 11.

   I HAVE considered how apt men are to abuse the long-suffering of God,
   to the hardening and encouraging of themselves in sin, and when this
   comes to pass; where I considered the several false conclusions which
   sinners draw from the delay of punishment, as if there were no God, or
   providence, or difference of good and evil; or else, as is more
   commonly pretended, that sin is not so great an evil, and that God is
   not so highly offended at it, or that God is not so severe as he is
   represented; that the punishment of sin is not so certain; or, however,
   it is at a distance, and may be prevented by a future repentance: all
   which I have spoken fully to, and endeavoured to shew the fallacy and
   unreasonableness of them. I shall now proceed to the

   Third and last thing I propounded, which was, to answer an objection to
   which this discourse may seem liable, and that is this; If the
   long-suffering of God be the occasion of men's hardness and
   impenitency, then why is God so patient to sinners, when they are so
   prone to abuse his goodness and patience? And how is it goodness in God
   to for bear sinners so long, when this forbearance of his is so apt to
   minister to them an occasion of their farther mischief and greater
   ruin? It should seem, according to this, that it would be much greater
   mercy to the greatest part of sinners, not to be patient toward them at
   all; but instantly, upon the first occasion and provocation, to cut
   them off, and so to put a stop to their wickedness, and to hinder them
   from making themselves more miserable, by increasing their guilt, and
   "treasuring up wrath to themselves against the day of wrath."

   This is the objection; and because it seems to be of some weight, I
   shall endeavour to return a satisfactory answer to it in these
   following particulars. And,

   I. I ask the sinner if he will stand to this: art thou serious, and
   wouldest thou, in good earnest, have God to deal thus with thee, to
   take the very first advantage to destroy thee, or turn thee into hell,
   and to make thee miserable beyond all hopes of recovery? Consider of it
   again. Dost thou think it desirable, that God shall deal thus with
   thee, and let fly his judgments upon thee, so soon as ever thou hast
   sinned? If not, why do men trifle, and make an objection against the
   long-suffering of God, which they would be very loath should be made
   good upon them?

   If. It is likewise to be considered, that the long-suffering of God
   towards sinners is not a total forbearance: it is usually so mixed with
   afflictions and judgments of one kind or other, upon ourselves or
   others, as to be a sufficient warning to us, if we would consider and
   lay it to heart, to "sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon us:"
   lest that judgment which we saw inflicted upon others come home to us.
   And is not this great goodness to warn us, when he might destroy us? to
   leave room for a retreat, when he might put our case past remedy?

   All this time of God's patience he threatens sinners, to awaken them
   out of their security; he punisheth them gently, that we may have no
   ground to hope for impunity; he makes examples of some in a more severe
   and remarkable manner, that others may hear, and fear, and be afraid to
   commit the like sins, lest the like punishment overtake them; he whips
   some offenders before our eyes, to shew us what sin deserves, and what
   we also may justly expect, if we do the same thing: and will nothing be
   a warning to us, but our own sufferings!

   Nay, God doth usually send some judgment or other upon every sinner in
   this life; he lets him feel the rod, that he may know that it is "an
   evil and bitter thing to sin against him." He exerciseth men with many
   afflictions, and crosses, and disappointments, which their own
   consciences tell them are the just recompences of their deeds; and by
   these lighter strokes, he gives us a merciful warning to avoid his
   heavier blows; when mercy alone will not work upon us and win us, but,
   being fed to the full, we grow wanton and foolish, he administers
   physic to us by affliction, and by adversity endeavours to bring us to
   consideration and a sober mind; and many have been cured this way, and
   the judgments of God have done them that good, which his mercies and
   blessings could not; for God would save us any way, by his mercy or by
   his judgment, by sickness or by health, by plenty or by want, by what
   we desire, or by what we dread; so desirous is he of our repentance and
   happiness, that he leaves no method unattempted that may probably do us
   good; he strikes upon every passion in the heart of man; he works upon
   our love by his goodness, upon our hopes by his promises, and upon our
   fears, first by his threatenings, and if they be not effectual, then by
   his judgments; he tries every affection, and takes hold of it, if by
   any means he may draw us to himself; and will nothing warn us but what
   will ruin us, and render our case desperate and past hope!

   And if any sinner be free from outward afflictions and sufferings, yet
   sin never fails to carry its own punishment along with it; there is a
   secret sting and worm, a Divine nemesis and revenge that is bred in the
   bowels of every sin, and makes it a heavy punishment to itself; the
   conscience of a sinner doth frequently torment him, and his guilt
   haunts and dogs him wherever he goes; for whenever a man commits a
   known and wilful sin, he drinks down poison, which, though it may work
   slowly, yet it will give him many a gripe, and, if no means be used to
   expel it, will destroy him at last.

   So that the long-suffering of God is wisely ordered, and there is such
   a mixture of judgments in it, as is sufficient to awaken sinners, and
   much more apt to deter them from sin, than to encourage them to go on
   and continue in it.

   III. Nothing is farther from the intention of God than to harden men by
   his long-suffering. This the Scripture most expressly declares; (2 Pet.
   iii. 9.) "He is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
   perish, but that all should come to repentance." He hath a very
   gracious and merciful design in his patience towards sinners, and is
   therefore good, that he may make us so, and that we may cease to do
   evil. The event of God's long-suffering may, by our own fault and abuse
   of it, prove our ruin; but the design and intention of it is our
   repentance. "He winks at the sins of men (saith the son of Sirach) that
   they may repent." He passeth them by, and does not take speedy
   vengeance upon sinners for them, that they may have time to repent of
   them, and "to make their peace with them while they are yet in the
   way."

   Nay, his long-suffering doth not only give space for repentance, but is
   a great argument and encouragement to it. That he is so loath to
   surprise sinners, that he gives them the liberty of second thoughts,
   time to reflect upon themselves, to consider what they have done, and
   to retract it by repentance, is a sufficient intimation that he hath no
   mind to ruin us, that "he desires not the death of a sinner, but rather
   that he should turn from his wickedness and live." And should not this
   goodness of his make us sorry that we have offended him? Doth it not
   naturally lead and invite us to repentance? What other interpretation
   can we make of his patience, what other use in reason should we make of
   it, but to repent and return that we may be saved?

   IV. There is nothing in the long-suffering of God, that is in truth any
   ground of encouragement to men in an evil course; the proper and
   natural tendency of God's goodness is to lead men to repentance, and by
   repentance to bring them to happiness: (Rom. ii. 4.) "Despisest thou
   the riches of his goodness, and patience, and long-suffering, not
   knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?" This St.
   Peter, with relation to these very words of St. Paul, interprets,
   "leading to salvation;" (2 Pet. iii. 15.) "And account that the
   long-suffering of our Lord is salvation, as our beloved brother Paul
   also hath written unto you. Now where did St. Paul write so, unless in
   this text; "not knowing that the goodness of God leads to repentance?"
   It is not only great ignorance, and a very gross mistake, to think that
   it is the design and intention of God's patience and long-suffering to
   encourage men in sin; but likewise to think, that, in the nature of the
   thing, goodness can have any tendency to make men evil; "not knowing
   that the goodness of God leads to repentance."

   V. That through the long-suffering of God sinners are hardened in their
   evil ways, is wholly to be ascribed to their abuse of God's goodness;
   it is neither the end and intention, nor the proper and natural effect
   of the thing, but the accidental event of it through our own fault. And
   is this any real objection against the long-suffering of God? May not
   God be patient, though sinners be impenitent? May not he be good,
   though we be so foolish as to make an ill use of his goodness? Because
   men are apt to abuse the mercies and favours of God, is it therefore a
   fault in him to bestow them upon us? Is it not enough for us to abuse
   them, but will we challenge God also of unkindness in giving them? May
   not God use wise and fitting means for our recovery, because we are so
   foolish as not to make a wise use of them? And must he be charged with
   our ruin, because he seeks by all means to prevent it? Is it not enough
   to be injurious to ourselves, but will we be unthankful to God also?
   When God hath laid out "the riches of his goodness and patience" upon
   sinners, will they challenge him as accessary to their ruin? As if a
   foolish heir, that hath prodigally wasted the fair estate that was left
   him, should be so far from blaming himself, as to charge his father
   with undoing him. Are these the best returns which the infinite mercy
   and patience of God hath deserved from us? "Do we thus requite the
   Lord, foolish people and unwise!"

   God's patience would save sinners, but they ruin themselves by their
   abuse of it: let the blame then lie where it is due, and let God have
   the glory of his goodness, though men refuse the benefit and advantage
   of it.

   VI. And lastly; But because this objection pincheth hardest in one
   point, viz. that God certainly foresees that a great many will abuse
   his long-suffering, to the increasing of their guilt, and the
   aggravating of their condemnation; and how is long-suffering any mercy
   and goodness to those, who he certainly foreknows will in the event be
   so much the more miserable, for having had so much patience extended to
   them? Therefore, for a full answer, I desire these six things may be
   considered:

   1. That God designs this life for the trial of our obedience, that,
   according as we behave ourselves, he may reward or punish us in another
   world.

   2. That there could be no trial of obedience, nor any capacity of
   rewards and punishments, but upon the supposition of freedom and
   liberty; that is, that we do not do what we do upon force and
   necessity, but upon free choice.

   3. That God, by virtue of the infinite perfection of his knowledge,
   does clearly and certainly fore see all future events, even those which
   are most contingent, such as are the arbitrary actions of free and
   voluntary agents. This I know hath been denied, but without reason;
   since it is not only contrary to the common apprehensions of mankind,
   from the very light of nature, that God should not foreknow future
   events, but to clear and express Scripture; and that in such instances,
   for the sake of which they deny God's fore-knowledge, in general, of
   the future actions of free and voluntary agents; I mean, that the
   Scripture expressly declares God's determinate fore-knowledge of the
   most wicked actions; as the crucifying of Christ, who is said,
   "according to the determinate counsel and fore-knowledge of God," to
   have been "by wicked hands crucified and slain."

   4. That the bare fore-knowledge of things future hath no more influence
   upon them to make them to be, than the sight and knowledge of things
   present hath upon them to make them to be present. I may see or know
   that the sun is risen, without being the cause of its rising; and no
   more is bare knowledge of future events the cause that they are when
   they are. And if any man ask, how God can certainly foreknow things
   which depend upon free and arbitrary causes, unless he do some way
   decree and determine them? I answer, that this is not a fair and
   reasonable demand to ask of men, who have but finite understandings, to
   make out and declare all the ways that infinite knowledge hath of
   knowing and of foreseeing the actions of free creatures, without
   prejudice to their liberty and freedom of acting. However, it is, of
   the two, much more credible to reason, that infinite knowledge should
   certainly foreknow things, which our understandings cannot imagine how
   they should be foreknown, than that God should any ways be the author
   of sin, by determining and decreeing the wicked actions of men. The
   first only argues the imperfection of our under standing; but the other
   lays the greatest blemish and imperfection that can be upon the Divine
   nature.

   So that this difficult controversy about the fore knowledge of God is
   brought to this point, whether a man had better believe that infinite
   knowledge may be able to foreknow things in a way which our finite
   understanding cannot comprehend; or to ascribe something to God, from
   whence it would unavoidably follow, that he is the author of sin. The
   first is only a modest and just acknowledgment of our own ignorance,
   the last is the utmost and greatest absurdity that a man can be brought
   to; and to say that we cannot believe the fore-knowledge of God, unless
   we can make out the particular manner of it, is more unreasonable, than
   if an ignorant man should deny a difficult proposition in Euclid, or
   Archimedes, to be demonstrated, because he knows not how to demonstrate
   it.

   5. And consequently, fore-knowledge and liberty may very well consist;
   and, notwithstanding God's fore-knowledge of what men will do, they may
   be as free as if he did not foreknow it. And,

   Lastly, That God doth not deal with men according to his fore-knowledge
   of the good or bad use of their liberty, but according to the nature
   and reason of things; and therefore, if he be long-suffering toward
   sinners, and do not cut them off upon the first provocation, but give
   them a space and opportunity of repentance, and use all proper means
   and arguments to bring them to repentance, and be ready to afford his
   grace to excite good resolutions in them, and to second and assist
   them, and they refuse and resist all this; their wilful obstinacy and
   impenitency is as culpable, and God's goodness and patience as much to
   be acknowledged, as if God did not foresee the abuse of it; because his
   foresight and knowledge of what they would do laid no necessity upon
   them to do what they did.

   If a prince had the privilege of fore-knowledge, as God hath, and did
   certainly foresee that a great many of his subjects would certainly
   incur the penalty of his laws, and that others would abuse his goodness
   and clemency to them; yet, if he would govern them like free and
   reasonable creatures, he ought to make the same wise laws to restrain
   their exorbitancy, and to use the same clemency in all cases that did
   fairly admit of it, as if he did not at all foresee what they would do,
   nor how they would abuse his clemency; for it is nevertheless fit to
   make wise and reasonable laws, and to govern with equity and clemency,
   though it were certainly fore seen that they that are governed would
   act very foolishly and unreasonably in the use of their liberty. It is
   great goodness in God to give men the means and opportunity of being
   saved, though they abuse his goodness to their farther ruin; and he may
   be heartily grieved for that folly and obstinacy in men, which he
   certainly foresees will end in their ruin; and may, with great
   seriousness and sincerity, wish they would do otherwise, and were as
   "wise to do good," as they are "wilful to do evil." And thus he is
   represented in Scripture, as regretting the mischief which men wilfully
   bring upon themselves: "O that they were wise! O that they would
   understand, and consider their latter end!"

   And this is sufficient to vindicate the goodness of God in his patience
   and long-suffering to sinners, and to make them wholly guilty of all
   that befals them for their wilful contempt and abuse of it.

   I shall draw some inferences from this whole discourse upon this
   argument.

   I. This shews the unreasonableness and perverse disingenuity of men,
   who take occasion to harden and encourage themselves in sin from the
   long-suffering of God, which, above all things in the world, should
   melt and soften them. Thou hast sinned, and art liable to the justice
   of God; sentence is gone forth, but God respites the execution of it,
   and hath granted thee a reprieve, and time and opportunity to sue out
   thy pardon. Now what use ought we in reason to make of this patience of
   God to wards us? We ought certainly "to break off our sins by" a speedy
   "repentance, lest iniquity be our ruin;" immediately to sue out our
   pardon, and "to make our peace with God, while we are yet in the way,"
   and to resolve never any more willingly to offend that God, who is so
   gracious and merciful, so long-suffering and full of compassion. But
   what use do men commonly make of it? They take occasion to confirm and
   strengthen themselves in their wickedness, and to reason themselves
   into vain and groundless hopes of impunity. Now what a folly is this,
   because punishment doth not come, therefore to hasten it, and to draw
   it down upon ourselves? Because it hath not yet overtaken us, therefore
   to go forth and meet it? Because there is yet a possibility of escaping
   it, therefore to take a certain course to make it unavoidable? Because
   there is yet hope concerning us, therefore to make our case desperate
   and past remedy? See how unreason ably men bring ruin upon themselves;
   so that well might the Psalmist ask that question, "Have all the
   workers of iniquity no knowledge?"

   But their folly and unreasonableness is not so great, but their
   perverseness and disingenuity is greater. To sin because God is
   long-suffering, is "to be evil because he is good," and to provoke him,
   because he spares us: it is to strive with God, and to contend with his
   goodness, as if we were resolved to try the utmost length of his
   patience; and because God is loath to punish, therefore to urge and
   importune him to that which is so contrary to his inclination.

   II. This may serve to convince men of the great evil and danger of thus
   abusing the long-suffering of God. It is a provocation of the highest
   nature, because it is to trample upon his dearest attributes, those
   which he most delights and glories in, his goodness and mercy; for the
   long-suffering of God is his goodness to the guilty, and his mercy to
   those who deserve to be miserable.

   Nothing makes our ruin more certain, more speedy, and more intolerable,
   than the abuse of God's goodness and patience. After God had borne long
   with that rebellious people, the children of Israel, and,
   notwithstanding all their murmurings, all their infidelity and
   impenitency, had spared them ten times, at last he sets his seal to
   their ruin: (Heb. iii. 8, 9.) "Harden not your hearts, as in the
   provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness: when your
   fathers proved me, and saw my works forty years." This was a high
   provocation indeed, to harden their hearts under the patience and
   long-suffering of God, after forty years trial and experience of it:
   (ver. 10.) "Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said,
   They are a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known
   my ways." And what was the issue of all this? Upon this God takes up a
   fixed resolution to bear no longer with them, but to cut them off from
   the blessings he had promised to bestow upon them; "He sware in his
   wrath that they should not enter into his rest.--To whom sware he, that
   they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?" Or
   as the word may be rendered, "to them that were disobedient?" that is,
   to them who went on in their rebellion against him, after he had
   suffered their manners forty years.

   And as the abuse of God's patience renders our destruction more
   certain, so more speedy and more intolerable. We think, that because
   God suffers long he will suffer always; and because punishment is
   delayed, therefore it will never come; but it will come the sooner for
   this: so our Lord tells us, (Luke xii.) when the servant said, his lord
   delayed his corning; "the lord of that servant shall come in a day that
   he looks not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and shall
   cut him in sunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites."
   None so like to be surprised by the judgment of God, as those who
   trespass so boldly upon his patience.

   III. To persuade us to make a right use of the patience and
   long-suffering of God, and to comply with the merciful end and design
   of God therein.

   1. It is the design of God's long-suffering to give us a space of
   repentance. Were it not that God had this design and reasonable
   expectation from us, he would not reprieve a sinner for one moment, but
   would execute his judgments upon him so soon as ever he had offended.
   This our Saviour declares to us by the parable of the fig-tree, (Luke
   xiii. 6.) Were it not that God expects from us the fruit of repentance,
   he would cut us down, and not suffer us to cumber the ground: after he
   had "waited three years, seeking fruit and finding none, he spares it
   one year more, to see if it would bear fruit."

   2. The long-suffering of God is a great encouragement to repentance. We
   see by his patience that he is not ready to take advantage against us;
   that he spares us when we offend, is a very good sign that he will
   forgive us if we repent. Thus natural light would reason; and so the
   King of Nineveh, a heathen, reasons, "Who can tell if God will turn and
   repent?" But we are fully assured of this by the gracious declarations
   of the gospel, and the way of pardon and forgiveness, which is therein
   established through faith in the blood of Jesus Christ, who was made a
   "propitiation for the sins of the whole world."

   Therefore the long-suffering of God should be a powerful argument to
   us, "to break off our sins by repentance:" for this is the end of God's
   patience; "He is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
   perish, but that all should come to repentance. He hath no pleasure in
   the death of the wicked, but that the wicked should turn from his way
   and live." God every where expresseth a vehement desire and earnest
   expectation of our repentance and conversion. (Jer. iv. 14.) "O
   Jerusalem! wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved."
   And, (chap. xiii. 27.) "Woe unto thee, Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made
   clean? when shall it once be?" He who is so patient as to the
   punishment of our sins, is almost impatient of our repentance for them;
   "Wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?" And can we stand
   out against his earnest desire of our happiness, whom we have so often
   and so long provoked to make us miserable? Let us then return into
   ourselves, and think seriously what our case and condition is; how we
   have lived, and how long the patience of God hath suffered our manners,
   and waited for our repentance, and how inevitable and intolerable the
   misery of those must be who live and die in the contempt and abuse of
   it; let us heartily repent of our wicked lives, and say, "What have we
   done?" How careless have we been of our own happiness, and what pains
   have we taken to undo ourselves!

   Let us speedily set about this work, because we do not know how long
   the patience of God may last, and the opportunities of our salvation be
   continued to us. This day of God's grace and patience will have an end;
   therefore, as the prophet exhorts, (Isa. lv. 6.) "Seek the Lord while
   he may be found, and call upon him while he is near." Now God
   graciously invites sinners to come to him, and is ready to receive
   them; nay, if they do but move towards him, he is ready to go forth and
   meet them half way; but the time will come, when he will bid them
   depart from him; when they shall cry, "Lord, Lord, open unto us," and
   the door of mercy shall be shut against the them.

   All the while thou delayest this necessary work, thou venturest thy
   immortal soul, and puttest thy eternal salvation upon a desperate
   hazard; and should God snatch thee suddenly away in an impenitent
   state, what would become of thee? Thou art yet in the way, and God is
   yet reconcileable, but death is not far off, and perhaps much nearer to
   thee than thou art aware; at the best thy life is uncertain, and death
   will infallibly put a period to this day of God's grace and patience.

   Repentance is a work so necessary, that methinks no man should lose so
   much time as to deliberate, whether he should set about it or not; De
   necessariis nulla est deliberatio; "No man deliberates about what he
   must do, or be undone if he do it not." It is a work of so great
   consequence and concernment, and the delay of it so infinitely
   dangerous, that one would think no wise man could entertain a thought
   of deferring it. What greater folly and stupidity can there be, than
   for men to venture their immortal souls, and to run an apparent hazard
   in matters of everlasting consequence.

   This day of God's patience is the great opportunity of our salvation;
   and if we let it slip, it is never to be recovered: if we misimprove
   this time of our life, we shall not be permitted to live it over again
   to improve it better. Our state of trial ends with this life; after
   that God will prove us no more; then we shall wish, "O that I had
   known, in that my day, the things which belonged to my peace! but now
   they are hid from mine eyes: therefore to day, whilst it is called
   to-day, harden not your hearts, make no tarrying to turn to the Lord,
   and put not off from day to day; for suddenly shall the wrath of the
   Lord break forth, and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed. Exercise
   repentance in the time of health, and defer not till death to be
   justified."

SERMON CLII.

  THE POWER OF GOD.

   God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this, that power belongeth
   unto God.--Psalm lxii. 11.

   IN treating of the attributes of God, I have considered those which
   relate to the Divine understanding, to which I referred his knowledge
   and wisdom; those also which relate to the Divine will; viz. God's
   justice, truth, holiness, and goodness: I come now to consider his
   power of acting, which is his omnipotency; this I shall speak to from
   these words.

   In the beginning of this Psalm, David declares that God was the great
   object of his trust and confidence, and that all his hopes and
   expectation of safety and deliverance were from him, (ver. 1, 2.) And
   this makes him challenge his enemies for all their mischievous
   qualities and devices against him, as vain attempts, (ver. 3, 4.)
   Hereupon he chargeth himself to continue his trust and confidence in
   God, from whom was all his expectation, and who was able to save and
   deliver him, (ver. 5-7.) And from his example and experience, he
   encourageth and exhorts all others to trust in God, (ver. 8.) and that
   from two arguments.

   1. Because all other objects of our trust and confidence are vain and
   insufficient, and will fail those that rely upon them. If we will rely
   upon any thing in this world, it must either be persons or things; but
   we cannot safely repose our trust in either of these. Not in persons:
   they may be reduced to one of these two heads, either high or low:
   those that are of a mean condition, it would be in vain to trust them;
   they that cannot secure themselves from meanness, cannot secure others
   from mischief; "Men of low degree are vanity:" but the great ones of
   the world, they seem to promise something of assistance and security to
   us; but if we depend upon them, they will frustrate us; "Men of high
   degree are a lie." As for the things of the world, that which men
   usually place their confidence in, is riches; these are either got by
   unlawful or lawful means; if they be ill gotten, by oppression or
   robbery, they will be so far from securing us from evil, that they will
   bring it upon us; if they be well gotten, they are of such an uncertain
   nature, that we have little reason to place our hopes in them; "if
   riches increase, set not your hearts upon them;" that is, your hope;
   for heart in Scripture signifies any of the affections.

   2. Because God is the proper object of our trust and confidence. We may
   safely rely upon any one, in whom these two things concur a power to
   help us, and goodness to incline him so to do. Now David tells us, that
   both these are eminently in God, and do in a peculiar manner belong to
   him; power, (ver. 11.) and goodness, (ver. 12.)

   I shall speak to that which David makes the first ground of our
   confidence, the power of God; "power belongs to God:" for which he
   brings the testimony of God himself; "once hath God spoken, yea, twice
   have I heard this." Some interpreters trouble themselves about the
   meaning of this expression, as if it did refer to some particular
   revelation of God: and then again, they are troubled how to reconcile
   God's speaking this but once, with David's hearing it twice: but I do
   not love to spy mysteries in those expressions, which are capable of a
   plain sense; for I understand no more by it but this, that God hath
   several times revealed this; he frequently declared himself by this
   attribute, ." once, yea twice;" that is, he hath spoken it often, and
   David had heard it often. This is answerable to that phrase of the
   Latins, Semel atque iterum; and it is usual in all writers, to use a
   certain number for an uncertain, and particularly among poets, Felices
   ter et amplius.--Horace. And so in the poetical writers of Scripture:
   (Job v. 19.) He hath "delivered thee in six troubles, yea, in seven
   there shall no evil touch thee;" that is, in several and various
   troubles. (Eccles. xi. 2.) "Give a portion to seven, and also to
   eight;" that is, distribute thy charity to many: and, which is nearest
   to this, (Job xl. 5.) "Once have I spoken, but I will not answer; yea,
   twice, but I will proceed no farther;" that is, I have had several
   discourses with my friends: and (xxxiii. 14.) "God speaketh once, yea,
   twice, in a dream, in a vision of the night;" that is, God reveals
   himself in several ways and manners to men: so here, "God hath spoken
   once, yea, twice;" that is, God hath often declared this. And if I
   would be so curious to refer to a particular declaration of God, I
   should think that it related either to the preface to the law, "I am
   the Lord thy God," that is, the great and powerful God, "that brought
   thee out of the land of Egypt;" or rather to the declaration which God
   made of himself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by the name of the
   Almighty God, (Gen. xvii. 1.) Concerning which revelation of God, it is
   said expressly, (Exod. vi. 3.) "I appeared unto Abraham, and Isaac, and
   Jacob, by the name of God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah, was I not
   known to them."

   But that which I design to speak to is the proposition itself, that
   power belongs to God; that is, that the excellency of power, power in
   its highest degree and perfection, all power belongs to God; that is,
   that omnipotence is a property or perfection of the Divine nature.

   In the handling of this I shall shew,

   First, What we are to understand by the omnipotence of God.

   Secondly, That this perfection belongs to God.

   First, What we are to understand by the omnipotence of God. And this I
   shall consider,

   I. As to the principle. And,

   II. As to the exercise of it.

   I. As to the principle; it is an ability to do all things, the doing of
   which speaks power and perfection; that is, whatever is not repugnant
   either to the nature of things, or of God; whatever does not imply a
   contradiction in the thing, or an imperfection in the doer; an ability
   to do all things which are consistent with itself, and with the Divine
   nature and perfection; by which we must mean an executive power, the
   effect whereof is without himself; for what he is said to do within
   himself, the acts of his understanding and will, as we conceive his
   will to be distinct from his power, are not to be referred to his
   omnipotence. To have a right conception of omnipotence, we must imagine
   the most perfect active principle that we can, and it is still
   something more perfect than that, or any thing we can imagine. To help
   our conception,

   1. Let us imagine a principle from which all other power is derived,
   and upon which it depends, and to which it is perfectly subject and
   subordinate.

   2. A perfect active principle, which can do, not only what any finite
   being or creature can do, but what all beings joined together can do;
   nay, more and greater things than they all can do.

   3. A perfect active principle, to which nothing can make any
   considerable, much less effectual resistance, which can check and
   countermand at pleasure, and carry down before it, and annihilate all
   other powers that we can imagine besides this; because we cannot
   imagine any other power, that is not derived from this, and does not
   depend upon it.

   4. A perfect active principle, which can do all things in a most
   perfect manner, and can do all things at once, and in an instant, and
   that with ease. We can but do one thing at once; and the greater and
   more considerable it is, the more time it will ask us to do it, and we
   find it the harder and more difficult to be done: but God, to whose
   knowledge all things are present at once, and together, and the acts of
   whose will are as quick and perfect as of his understanding, hath a
   power answerable to the perfection of both; and therefore it is as easy
   to him to do all things, as one thing; at once, as successively, and in
   time. For this is the privilege of an infinite Spirit, that it does not
   only act without hands and material engines or instruments, as every
   spirit doth, but without motion from one place to another; because he
   is every where, and fills all places; he acts per modum voluntatis, as
   if his actings were nothing else but a willing that such a thing be
   done; and, ipso facto, every thing is so, as he wills it should be, and
   when he wills it should be; as if things did start up into being, or
   vanish out of being, as if they did break forth into being, and sculk
   again into nothing, and undergo such and such changes, ad nutum
   voluntatis, "at the beck of his will." And this is the most perfect way
   of acting that can be imagined, which the Scripture seems to express to
   us, when it represents God as making things by his word, up holding all
   things by the word of his power; as if he did but speak the word, and
   say, Let such a thing be, and it was so; as if there were nothing more
   required to the doing of any thing, but an express act of the Divine
   will, which is all we can understand by God's speaking, by his word,
   and voice, and saying, Let things be; but the least that it can
   signify, is the quick and speedy manner of working, whereby God is able
   to do things in an instant, as soon as a word can be spoken.

   And as he can do all things at once, and in an instant, so with ease,
   without any pain or laborious endeavour; for what is it that can object
   any difficulty to him? At the first creation of things, there was
   nothing to resist him; and since the creation, here is nothing but what
   was made by him, and consequently all, whose power is derived from him,
   and depends upon him, and is subject to him, and being finite and
   limited, is infinitely unequal to the infinite power of God; so that we
   may imagine the Divine power would pass through all the resistance hat
   all created power can make, and all the difficulties it can object to
   it, with more ease than a bullet passeth through the thin air, or a man
   would pass through a net of cobweb.

   5. The most perfect active principle we can imagine, the utmost bounds
   and limits of whose perfection we cannot imagine, that is, when we have
   imagined it to be as perfect, and to act in as perfect a manner as we
   can imagine, yet we have not reached the perfection of it; but after
   all this, that it can do many things more than we can imagine, and in a
   manner much more perfect than we can imagine. This is the omnipotence
   of God as to the principle, which hath no bounds and limits. And,

   II. As to the exercise of it, it is only limited by the Divine will and
   wisdom. The Divine will determines it to its exercise, the Divine
   wisdom directs and regulates the exercise of it; that is, God
   exerciseth his power willingly, and not by necessity, and in such
   manner, for the producing such effects, and in order to such ends and
   purposes, as seem best to his wisdom. Hence he is said to act all
   things according to his good pleasure, and according to the counsel of
   his will; that is, freely and wisely.

   As to the extent of this power, I said it was an ability to do all
   things that are consistent with itself, and with the nature and
   perfection of God.

   First, That are consistent with itself; that is, with a power to do all
   things. It is a contradiction to imagine that omnipotence can do that,
   which, if it could be done, would render all power insignificant. Upon
   this account, the Divine power is not said to extend to the working of
   any thing which implies a contradiction, and the terms whereof speak a
   repugnancy to one another, and mutually destroy one another, and the
   doing whereof is contrary to the nature of the thing which is supposed
   to be done; that is, is nonsense, and cannot be imagined to be. For
   example, that a thing should be, and not be, at the same time. For a
   power to make a thing to be, so as it should not be while it is,
   signifies nothing, because such a being as is not, is nothing; and to
   make such a being, would be to do nothing, and consequently such a
   power would signify nothing. So likewise we cannot say, that the Divine
   power can cause that the same thing should be made and not be made;
   that that which hath been, should not have been; for the power which
   makes a thing, so as that it was not made, and causeth a thing to have
   been, so as that it hath not been, does nothing; and consequently is no
   power. Nor can we say, that the Divine power can effect that any thing
   should be made by itself; that is, be the cause of its own being; for
   that would be to cause that a thing should be before it is; that is, be
   when it is not, which signifies nothing. We cannot say, that the Divine
   power can effect, that twice two should not make four; for that would
   be to cause that things should not be what they are, if they be at all;
   which is to cause that things should be, and not be at all, when they
   are, which amounts to nothing.

   We cannot say, the Divine power can make a sound to be seen, and colour
   to be heard; for that would be to make colour and sound all one; that
   is, things that differ, to be the same while they differ, which is to
   make colour and sound not to be colour and sound while they are so;
   which is to do nothing, and consequently argues no power.

   We cannot say, that the Divine power can make that which is
   intrinsically and essentially good to be evil; and on the contrary: or
   that which is necessarily true to be false; and on the contrary. For to
   make that which is intrinsically and essentially to be evil, is to make
   that which is always good to be sometimes evil; that is, to be evil
   whilst it is good; that is, to make good and evil all one; which is to
   bring two things together, which so soon as they do exist, destroy one
   another, which is to no purpose, because it is to do just nothing; and
   there is the same reason of true and false.

   We cannot say, that the power of God can cause that the same thing
   should be hot and cold, dead and alive, at the same time, because these
   destroy one another; and if they were both, neither of them would be,
   and so the effect we attribute to this power would be nothing.

   We cannot say, that the Divine power can effect that the same
   impression should give a thing two contrary motions, upward and
   downward, at the same time; that the same body should be in two
   contrary postures, in motion and at rest, and in several places, which
   are the contradictions of transubstantiation; for the same body to be
   at the same time in two several places, is to be limited and
   circumscribed by each of these; that is, so to be in each of them, as
   not to be in the other, or in any other; so that if it be in this
   place, it is not in that, nor in any other besides this; if it be in
   that place, it is not in this, nor any other besides that; but if it be
   in two, it is both in this and in that, and therefore in neither of
   them, nor any where else; so that a power to make a body to be in two
   places at once, is a power to make it to be no where; that is, not to
   be at all, which is no power; and there is the same reason of the same
   bodies being in contrary motion, or in motion and at rest, or in two
   contrary postures at the same time.

   So that by all these instances, it appears, that a power to do any
   thing which implies a contradiction, and is repugnant to the nature of
   things, signifies nothing; and the supposed effect of it is only to
   bring terms together, which, if they could be brought together, so soon
   as they meet, will mutually take away and destroy one another, which
   would be vain, and to no purpose.

   I have the more explicitly laid open these contradictions, with
   relation to the gross doctrine of transubstantiation, in which all or
   most of the contradictions which I have mentioned, are involved. I know
   they stiffly deny that these contradictions follow from that doctrine,
   and use pitiful shifts to avoid them; but being not able to satisfy
   themselves that way, if the worst should come to the worst, they can
   grant these contradictions, but then they fly to the power of God,
   which can do things which we call contradictions; or else they say,
   there are as many contradictions in the doctrine of the trinity, which
   all Christians believe. And thus they reproach Christianity to defend
   popery; and if they cannot persuade men to be papists, do what they can
   to make them atheists, or at least to hinder them from being
   Christians; but there is not so much malice in this objection, but
   there is as little strength. Is it any contradiction, that the same
   thing should be three and one in several respects? which is all that
   the Scripture teacheth concerning the Trinity: but if men will
   undertake to explain this more particularly than God thought fit to do,
   and do it in such a manner, as that they cannot free themselves from
   contradiction, let them look to it; the Christian religion is not at
   all concerned in this farther than to censure such men's boldness and
   curiosity.

   But against this exemption of things that imply a contradiction from
   the compass and extent of the Divine power, there are two objections
   which are more considerable, and deserve to be taken notice of.

   I. We grant God's fore-knowledge of future events, which seem to us to
   be impossible to be foreknown. Now, why may we not as well grant that
   God can do things which seem to us impossible to be done by any other
   power, as foreknow things which it is impossible for any understanding
   to know? For why should we pretend to know the utmost of what infinite
   power can do, any more than the utmost of what infinite understanding
   can know?

   Answer.--I know no reason but that the argument should be granted, if
   there were an equal necessity of granting the possibility of those
   things which seem to us impossible to be done, that there is of
   granting the possibility of foreknowing future contingencies, though
   they seem to us impossible to be known. We must grant the possibility
   of foreknowing future contingencies, because the Scripture, which we
   believe to be a Divine revelation, expressly tells us, that God doth
   foreknow them, and gives us instances of it in several prophecies and
   predictions. Now, if any man can shew me as express texts, which say,
   that God can make a body to be in two places at once, I would believe
   it, though I do not see how it is possible; because it is reasonable I
   should believe that infinite power can do many things, the possibility
   of which my finite understanding cannot reach. Now, whereas the papists
   say, the Scripture hath said, that from which this necessarily follows,
   viz. "This is my body;" this is not enough, unless they could either
   prove that it is necessary to understand all texts of Scripture in a
   rigorous and strict propriety of the letter, without admitting of any
   trope or figure in the words, which they do not pretend; or else shew a
   clear reason why this should be understood so, more than a thousand
   others; which they have not done, and I think never can do.

   But if it be farther argued; if we grant in one case, that those things
   which seem to be contradictions to us, may be possible, why not in all
   cases; unless we had some certain way of distinguishing between seeming
   contradictions and real ones? And if we grant all contradictions
   possible, then there is no reason to exempt these from the extent of
   the Divine power; but we may safely say, that the Divine power can make
   a thing to be, and not to be, at the same time. To this I answer,

   1. I do not grant that any thing which seems to me to be a
   contradiction, ought to be granted by me to be possible, unless I have
   higher assurance and greater reason to believe it to be possible, than
   I have to believe it to be a contradiction: for example, suppose it
   were clearly revealed in Scripture, that two bodies may be in the same
   place, and at the same time (which is not, nor any thing like it);
   then, having a revelation for this, and no revelation that it is not a
   contradiction, I have higher assurance, and greater reason to believe
   it possible, than that it is a contradiction; and consequently, I have
   reason to believe it is no contradiction, and that from thence it would
   not follow, that the same thing may be, and not be, at the same time:
   but though in case of Divine revelation, I may believe that to be no
   contradiction, which seems to me to be a contradiction; yet I am not,
   without great necessity and clear evidence, to offer violence to
   reason, and affront the faculty of understanding which God hath endowed
   me withal, by entertaining any thing which seems to me to be a
   contradiction; which the papists do in the business of
   transubstantiation, without any evidence of revelation, and
   consequently without necessity.

   2. But if this were revealed in Scripture, that the same thing may be,
   and not be, at the same time, I could have no reason to believe that,
   because I could have no assurance, if that were true, that the
   Scriptures were a Divine revelation, or that it were to be believed if
   it were; for if it were true, that the same thing may be and not be,
   then a Divine revelation may be no Divine revelation; and when I am
   bound to believe a thing, I may be bound at the same time not to
   believe it; and so all things would fall into uncertainty, and the
   foundation of all assurance, and of all duty and obedience, both of
   faith and practice, would be taken away.

   The second objection is from the power of creation, which is generally
   acknowledged to be a making of something out of nothing. Now, say the
   objectors, this seems as palpable a contradiction as any thing else.

   Answer.--To us, indeed, who converse with material things, and never
   saw any thing made but out of pre-existent matter, it is very hard to
   conceive how any thing should be created, that is, produced out of
   nothing: but every thing that is strange is not a contradiction. It is
   strange to us, and hard to conceive, that there should be such a thing
   as a spirit, who never saw, nor can see any thing but matter; and yet
   we grant there are spirits. It is hard to us to conceive how any thing
   should be made but out of matter; and yet spirit, if it were made of
   any thing pre-existent, cannot be made of matter: but if we will attend
   to those common dictates of reason, which every man, whether he will or
   no, must assent to, we may easily understand creation to be possible,
   and free from contradiction. For the clearing of this, I will proceed
   by these steps:

   1. The true notion of creation is, the bringing of something into
   being, which before had no being at all; for the phrase of making
   something out of no thing, or out of no pre-existent matter, does
   mislead our understandings into odd conceits, as if nothing could be
   the material cause of something, or as if nothing could be what is
   material.

   2. Every one must grant, that something is; for we see that things are,
   however they came to be.

   3. Every one must grant, that something is of itself, whether matter,
   or that being which we call God.

   4. Every one must grant, that that which was of itself, was always; for
   nothing can begin of itself.

   5. It is much more easy to conceive how a thing, that once was not,
   might sometimes be brought into being by another, than how a thing
   should be always of itself; for that which once was not, is supposed to
   have something before it, by which it might be made, though not out of
   which it was made; but that which was always, neither had, nor could
   have any thing, by which or out of which it could be made. And why
   cannot a thing come into being, when there was nothing before it out of
   which it was made, as well as a thing be always, when there could not
   be any thing before it out of which it should be?

   Secondly, I exempt those things from the extent of omnipotence, which
   imply imperfection, which are contrary to the nature and perfection of
   God, both natural and moral imperfections; for these also destroy
   power, because they are not arguments of power, but of impotence.
   Natural imperfections; as, to die, to be sick, to be in want, to eat,
   to sleep, to forget, &c. Moral imperfections, those which contradict
   the holiness of God, as sin and vice, or to compel any to sin; which
   contradict his goodness, as to be cruel; which contradict his truth, as
   to lie, to deceive, to break his promise, to deny himself. (Tit. i. 2;
   2 Tim. ii. 13; Jam. i. 12.) He is said to be apei'rastos kakon,
   contrary to the constancy and immutability of his nature, as to change
   his decree, to repent; contrary to justice and equity, as for ever to
   spare and to pardon obstinate sinners, eternally to punish innocent and
   good men; for these are moral imperfections, and contradict the
   holiness, and truth, and goodness, and justice, and immutability of the
   Divine nature; and that distinction between God's absolute and ordinate
   power, that is, that God hath an absolute power of doing some things,
   which yet, upon supposition of his decree, or promise, or goodness, or
   justice, he cannot do, is vain and frivolous, unless men mean by it
   only this, that some things which argue an imperfection, do not imply a
   contradiction, which is most true; but both these are absolutely and
   equally impossible to God. I proceed to the

   Second thing I proposed, that this perfection be longs to God: and this
   I shall shew,

   I. From the dictates of natural light.

   II. From Scripture or Divine revelation.

   I. From the dictates of natural light. This was one of the most usual
   titles which the heathens gave to their supreme Deity, Optimus Maximus;
   next to his goodness they placed his greatness, which does chiefly
   appear in his power; and they did not only attribute a great power to
   him, but an omnipotence. Nihil est quod Deus efficere, non potest,
   (saith Tully de Div.) Now their natural reason did convince them, that
   this perfection did belong to God by these three arguments:

   1. From those two great instances and expressions of his power,
   creation and providence; for the heathens did generally acknowledge the
   making of the world, and the preservation and government of it, to be
   the effects of power, determined by goodness, and regulated by wisdom.
   Hence they gave those titles to God of Opifex Rerum, and Rector Mundi.
   I say generally; I except Aristotle, who supposed the world not to have
   been made, but to have been from eternity; and Epicurus with his
   followers, who ascribed the regular and orderly frame of nature to a
   happy casualty and fortunate concourse of atoms: but, generally, the
   wiser did look upon the vast frame of nature, this stately fabric of
   the world, and the upholding and preserving of it, as an argument of a
   Divine and invisible power. And so the apostle tells us, (Rom. i. 20.)
   that by the light of nature "the invisible things of God were clearly
   seen by the things that were made, even his eternal power and Godhead."

   2. Because all other perfections, without this, would be insignificant
   and ineffectual, or else could not be at all. Without this, goodness
   would be an empty piece of good meaning, and not able to give any
   demonstration of itself; knowledge would be an idle speculation; and
   wisdom to contrive things, without power to effect them, would be an
   useless thing. There would be no such thing as justice, if the Divine
   nature were without a power to reward and punish; no such thing as
   faithfulness, if he had not a power to perform what he promises; no
   providence, for it would be in vain for him that hath no power, to take
   upon him to govern and to intermeddle in the affairs of the world.

   3. Without this there could be no religion. Take away the power of God,
   and there can be no foundation of faith and trust, no reason for fear;
   all arguments from hope and fear would be taken away; we could not
   expect any good, nor fear any harm, from an impotent being that could
   do nothing. The sanction of God's laws would be taken away. To give
   authority to laws, there must not only be a right to command, but power
   to back those commands; the grand security and last resort of all
   government and authority is power. (James iv. 12.) "There is one
   lawgiver, who is able to save, and to destroy." None can be a lawgiver,
   but he that hath this power, to reward and punish, to make men happy or
   miserable, "to save, or to destroy." Men would not pray to God, nor
   make any address to him, if they did not believe he was able to supply
   their wants, and relieve them in their straits; Nec in hunc furorem
   omnes mortales consensissent alloquendi surda numina et inefficaces
   deos.--Seneca. There would be no encouragement for men to serve God, if
   they did not believe that he was able to reward them, and bring them to
   happiness, and to defend them against all the enemies of their welfare,
   so that it should not be in the power of the most malicious spirits to
   hinder them of their happiness.

   II. From Scripture, or Divine revelation. In producing texts to this
   purpose, I will proceed by these steps:

   1. Take notice of those which in general ascribe power, and might, and
   strength to God. (Psal. xxiv. 8.) "The Lord, strong and mighty." "So
   girt with power; the mighty God; thine is the greatness and the power;
   thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory." Of the same nature
   are those places which call upon all creatures to ascribe this to God;
   "Give unto the Lord, ye mighty; give unto the Lord glory and strength."

   2. Those which ascribe this to God in an eminent degree. (Job ix. 4.)
   "He is mighty in strength; excellent in power; who is like unto him?
   The Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength."

   3. Those texts which ascribe such a power as transcends any human or
   created power. Such as those which express all the power which men have
   to be derived from God: (John xix. 11.) "Thou couldest have no power at
   all, except it were given thee from above." And those which advance the
   power of God above the power of men: (Luke xviii. 27.) "The things
   which are impossible with men, are possible with God: he is able to do
   exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think." (Eph. iii.
   20. 2 Chron. xx. 6. Job ix. 4.) "According to his mighty power, whereby
   he is able to subdue all things to himself." (Phil. iii. 21. Dan. iv.
   35.) Those which declare all things to be equally easy to him, and
   nothing difficult: "There is no thing too hard for thee." (Jer. xxxii.
   17. 2 Chron. xiv. 11. 1 Sam. xiv. 6.)

   4. Those which ascribe all power to him, by the titles of "Almighty,
   All-sufficient." (Gen. xvii. 1. Rev. iv. 8. 11; xv. 3; xvi. 7; xix. 16.
   Job xlii. 2.) "Thou canst do all things." (Matt. xix. 6. Mark x. 27.
   Luke i. 37)

   I have dispatched what I proposed upon this argument; give me leave to
   apply all in the following particulars.

   Use. First, The consideration of God's omnipotence may cause terror to
   wicked men. All this power which I have described, or rather which is
   so great that I cannot describe it, is engaged against sinners; "his
   power and his wrath is against all that forsake him:" (Ezra viii. 22.)
   And who knows what those words signify, (Psal. xc. 11.) "Who knoweth
   the power of thine anger? as is thy fear, so is thy wrath." There is no
   passion in the heart of man more infinite than our fear, it troubles us
   with jealousy and suspicion of the utmost that may happen; but when we
   have extended our fears to the utmost, the power of God's wrath
   reacheth farther. Whenever we sin, we challenge the Almighty, and dare
   infinite power to do its worst to us. (Job xv. 25.) Speaking of the
   wicked man, "He stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengthened!
   himself against the Almighty." Whom wilt thou fear, if not him who can
   make thee extremely happy or miserable for ever? "Will ye provoke the
   Lord to jealousy? are ye stronger than he?" Because he doth nothing
   against thee for the present, thinkest thou he can do nothing? (Nah. i.
   3.) "He is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not acquit the
   wicked." There is a day coming, when "the Son of man shall come in the
   clouds of heaven, with power and great glory."

   Secondly, The consideration of God's omnipotence should check the pride
   and vain confidence of men. What have we to be proud of? "What have we
   that we have not received? Where then is cause of boasting? Who may
   glory in his sight?" Those that have the greatest power, should
   remember whence it is derived, and render back the glory of it to the
   fountain of it. (Psal. xxix. 1.) "Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give
   unto the Lord glory and strength." So likewise it should take men off
   from relying upon their own strength, which at the best is but "an arm
   of flesh," as the Scripture calls it, for the weakness of it. Do we not
   see, that many times "the battle is not to the strong?" that things are
   not done "by might and by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord?" When
   he appears against the most potent, "their hearts melt within them, and
   there is no more spirit left in them," as it is said of the mighty
   inhabitants of Canaan, (Josh. v. 1.)

   Thirdly, We should make this omnipotence of God the object of our trust
   and confidence. This is the most proper use we can make of this
   doctrine, as David does in this Psalm; and this was used for a form of
   blessing the people in the name of God; (Psal. cxxxiv. 3.) "The Lord
   that made heaven and earth, bless thee." And David, when he magnifies
   God's deliverance of his people from the multitude of their enemies,
   resolves it into this, "our help standeth in the name of the Lord, who
   made heaven and earth." Thus did the great pattern and example of faith
   encourage and support his confidence in God in a very difficult trial;
   he staggered not at it, because "he believed God, who quickeneth the
   dead, and calleth those things that be not as though they were:
   therefore against hope he believed in hope," &c. (Rom. iv. 17, &c.)
   This gives life to all our devotion, to be persuaded that "God is able
   to do for us exceedingly above what we can ask or think," and that "his
   is the kingdom, the power, and the glory."

   I shall only caution two things, as to our reliance on the power of
   God.

   I. Labour to be such persons, to whom God hath promised that he will
   engage and employ his omni potence for their good. If we hope for any
   good from the Almighty, we must walk before him, and be perfect, as he
   said to Abraham. Good men have a peculiar interest in God's power;
   hence he is called "the Strength of Israel," and "the mighty One of
   Israel." If we do what God requires of us, we may expect that he will
   put forth his power, and exert his arm for us; but if we disobey, we
   must expect he will manifest his power against us, (Ez. viii. 22.) When
   we do well, we may "commit the keeping of our souls to him," (1 Pet.
   iv. 19.)

   II. Our expectations from the omnipotence of God must be with
   submission to his pleasure, and goodness, and wisdom; we must not
   expect that God will manifest his power when we think there is occasion
   for it; but when it seems best to him, he will so employ his
   omnipotence, as to manifest his goodness and wisdom.

   And with these two cautions, we may rely upon him in all our wants,
   both spiritual and temporal; for his Divine power can "give us all
   things that pertain to life and goodness," (2 Pet. i. 3.) We may trust
   him at all times, for the omnipotent God "neither slumbereth nor
   sleepeth; the Almighty fainteth not, neither is he weary. Trust ye in
   the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength."

SERMON CLIII.

  THE SPIRITUALITY OF THE DIVINE NATURE.

   God is a spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit
   and in truth.--John iv. 24.

   THESE are the words of our Saviour to the woman of Samaria, who was
   speaking to him of the difference between the Samaritans and the Jews,
   concerning religion; (ver. 20.) "Our fathers worshipped in this
   mountain; but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to
   worship." Christ tells her, "The time was coming, when the worshippers
   of God should neither be confined to that mountain, or to Jerusalem;
   but men should worship the Father in spirit and in truth;" when this
   carnal, and ceremonial, and typical worship of God, should be exalted
   into a more spiritual, a more real, and true, and substantial religion,
   which should not be confined to one temple, but should be universally
   diffused through the world. Now such a worship as this is most
   agreeable to the nature of God; for he "is a spirit, and those who
   worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth." In the words we
   have,

   First, A proposition laid down, "God is a spirit."

   Secondly, A corollary, or inference, deduced from it; "they that
   worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth." I shall speak of
   the proposition, as that which concerns my present design; and
   afterwards speak something to the corollary, or inference, deduced from
   it, together with some other inferences drawn from this truth, by way
   of application.

   First, That "God is a spirit." This expression is singular, and not to
   be paralleled again in the Scripture; indeed we have often mention made
   in the Scripture of "the Spirit of God," and the "Spirit of the Lord,
   "which signifies a Divine power and energy; and of the Holy Spirit,
   signifying the third person in the Trinity; God is called "the God of
   the spirits of all flesh," (Num. xvi. 22; xxvii. 16.) much in the same
   sense as he is called "the Father of spirits;" (Heb xii. 9.) that is,
   the Creator of the souls of men; but we nowhere meet with this
   expression, or any other equivalent to it, that "God is a spirit," but
   only in this place; nor had it been used here, but to prove that the
   best worship of God, that which is most proper to him, is spiritual: so
   that the thing which our Saviour here intends, is not to prove the
   spiritual nature of God, but that his worship ought to be spiritual;
   nor indeed is there any necessity that i should have been any where
   said in Scripture, that "God is a spirit," it being the natural notion
   of God; no more than it is necessary that it should b told us, that God
   is good, or that he is infinite, an, eternal, and the like; or that the
   Scripture should prove to us the being of a God. Ail these are manifest
   by the light of nature; and if the Scripture mentions them, it is ex
   abundanti, and it is usually in order to some farther purpose.

   For we are to know that the Scripture supposeth us to be men, and to
   partake of the common notion of human nature, and therefore doth not
   teach us philosophy, nor solicitously instruct us in those things which
   are born with us; but supposeth the knowledge of these, and makes use
   of these common principles and notions which are in us concerning God,
   and the immortality of our souls, and the life to come, to excite us to
   our duty, and quicken our endeavours after happiness. For I do not find
   that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul is any where expressly
   delivered in Scripture, but taken for granted; in like manner, that the
   Scripture doth not solicitously instruct us in the natural notions
   which we have of God, but supposeth them known to us; and if it mention
   them, it is not so much in order to knowledge as to practice; and
   therefore we need not wonder that this expression, which doth set forth
   to us the nature of God, is but once used in Scripture, and that
   brought in upon occasion, and for another purpose, because it is a
   thing naturally known. Plato says, that God is so'matos," without
   body." In like manner, Tully: Nec enim Deus ipse qui intelligitur a
   nobis alio modo intelligi potest, nisi mens quædam soluta et libera;
   segregata ab omni concretione mortali; "We cannot conceive of God, but
   as of a pure mind, entirely free from all mortal composition or
   mixture." And Plutarch after him, nous ou'n o theo`s, choristo`n eidos
   toute'sti amige`s pa'ses u'les, medeni` pa'theto sumpeplegme'non, "God
   is a mind, an abstract being, pure from all matter, and disentangled
   from whatever is possible or capable of suffering."

   So that natural light informing us that "God is a spirit," there was no
   need why the Scripture should inculcate this: it is an excellent medium
   or argument to prove that the worship of God should chiefly be
   spiritual; and although it was not necessary that it should have been
   mentioned for itself; that is, to inform us of a thing which we could
   not otherwise know; yet the wisdom of God, by the express mention of
   this, seems to have provided against an error, which some weaker and
   grosser spirits might be subject to. You know God is pleased, by way of
   condescension and accommodation of himself to our capacity, to
   represent himself to us in Scripture by human imperfections; and gives
   such descriptions of himself, as if he had a body, and bodily members.
   Now, to prevent any error or mistake that might be occasioned hereby,
   it seems very becoming the wisdom of God, some where in Scripture
   expressly to declare the spiritual nature of God, that none through
   weakness or wilfulness might entertain gross apprehensions of him. In
   speaking to this proposition, I shall,

   I. Explain what is meant by "a spirit."

   II. Endeavour to prove to you that "God is a spirit."

   III. Answer an objection or two.

   IV. Draw some inferences or corollaries from the whole.

   I. For the explication of the notion of a spirit; I shall not trouble
   you with the strict philosophical notion of it, as, that it is such a
   substance as is penetrable; that is, may be in the same place with a
   body, and neither keep out the body, nor be kept out by it; and that
   the parts which we imagine in it cannot be divided; that is, really
   separated and torn from one another, as the parts of a body; but I will
   give you a negative description of it. A spirit is not matter, it doth
   not fall under any of our senses, it is that which we cannot see nor
   touch; it is not a body, not flesh, and blood, and bones; for so we
   find spirit in Scripture opposed to flesh and body; (Isa. xxxi. 3.)
   "Their horses are flesh, and not spirit." So Luke xxiv. when Christ
   appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, they were terrified,
   and supposed it had been a spirit: (ver. 39.) but he said, "Behold my
   hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see, for a
   spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have." The most usual
   description of a spirit is by these negatives; it is not a body, hath
   not flesh and bones, doth not consist of matter, or of any thing that
   falls under our senses, that we can see or touch.

   II. For the proof of this proposition, that "God is a spirit." This is
   not to be proved by way of demonstration, for there is nothing before
   God, or which can be a cause of him; but by way of conviction, by
   shewing the absurdity of the contrary. The first and most natural
   notion that we have of God, is, that he is a being every way perfect-;
   and from this notion we must argue concerning the properties which are
   attributed to God, and govern all our reasonings concerning God by
   this; so that when any thing is said of God, the best way to know
   whether it be to be attributed to him, is to inquire whether it be a
   perfection or not; if it be, it belongs to him; if it be not, it is to
   be removed from him; and if any man ask, why I say God is so, or so, a
   spirit, or good, or just? the best reason that can be given, is,
   because these are perfections, and the contrary to these are
   imperfections. So that if I shew, that it would be an imperfection for
   God to be imagined to be a body, or matter, I prove that he is a
   spirit, because it is an imperfection, that is, an absurdity, to
   imagine him anything else: to imagine God to be a body, or matter, doth
   evidently contradict four great perfections of God.

   1. His infiniteness, or the immensity of his being. Grant me but these
   two things, that there is something in the world besides God, some
   other matter, as the heavens, the air, the earth, and all those things
   which we see; and grant me that two bodies cannot be in the same places
   at once; and then it will evidently follow, that wherever these are,
   God is shut out; and consequently God should not be infinite, nor in
   all places; and so much as there is of another matter in the world
   besides God, so many breaches there would be in the Divine nature, so
   many hiatuses.

   2. The knowledge and wisdom of God. It can not be imagined how mere
   matter can understand, how it can distinctly comprehend such variety of
   objects, and at one view take in past, present, and to come. Tully,
   speaking of spirits, saith, Animorum nulla in terris origo inveniri
   potest; "Their original cannot be found upon earth; for (saith he)
   there is no material or bodily thing," Quod vim memoriæ, mentis,
   cogitationis habeat, quod et præterita teneat, et futura provideat, et
   complecti possit præsentia; quæ sola divina sunt, "Which hath the power
   of memory, of understanding, of thought; which can retain things past,
   foresee things future, and comprehend things present; all which powers
   are purely Divine."

   3. Freedom and liberty. For the laws of matter are necessary, nor can
   we imagine any autexou'sion, any arbitrary principle in it. This
   puzzled the Epicureans, as we see in Lucretius; "For if (says he) all
   things move by certain and necessary laws, and there be a connexion of
   the parts of matter unto each other, so that if you move this, that
   must necessarily be moved, whence (saith he) is liberty?" Unde est hæc
   inquam fatis avulsa voluntas; "Whence is this principle of will, whose
   motions are not under any law of necessity?"

   4. Goodness. This follows from the former; for he is not good who does
   not know what he does, nor does it freely; so that take away
   understanding and liberty, and you take away goodness: now take away
   from God infiniteness, and knowledge, and liberty, and goodness, and
   you divest him of his glory; you take away his most essential
   perfections. So that these great absurdities following from the
   supposing of God to be mere matter or body, we are to conceive of him
   as another kind of substance; that is, a spirit. So that I wonder that
   the author of the Leviathan, who doth more than once expressly affirm,
   that there can be nothing in the world but what is material and
   corporeal, did not see that the necessary consequence of this position
   is to banish God out of the world. I would not be uncharitable, but I
   doubt he did see it, and was content with the consequence, and willing
   the world should entertain it: for it is so evident, that, by supposing
   the Divine essence to consist of matter, the immensity of the Divine
   nature is taken away; and it is also so utterly unimaginable how mere
   matter should understand, and be endowed with liberty, and consequently
   with goodness, that I cannot but vehemently suspect the man who denies
   God to be a spirit, either to have a gross and faulty understanding, or
   a very ill will against God, and an evil design to root out of the
   minds of men the belief of a God. I come in the

   III. Third place, to consider the objections.

   1st Obj.--Why then is God represented to us so often in Scripture by
   the parts and members of men's bodies? Answ. I shall only say, at
   present, that all these descriptions and representations of God are
   plainly made to comply with our weakness, by way of condescension and
   accommodation to our capacities.

   2d Obj.--How is it said, that "man was made after the image of God," if
   God be a spirit, of which there can be no likeness nor resemblance?
   Answ. Man is not said to be made after the image of God, in respect of
   the outward shape and features of his body, but in respect of the
   qualities of his mind, as holiness and righteousness; or of his
   faculties, as understanding and will; or, which the text seems most to
   favour, in respect of his dominion and sovereignty over the creatures;
   for, in the two former respects, the angels are made after the image of
   God. Now, this seems to be spoken peculiarly of men, (Gen. i. 24.) "Let
   us make man in our own image, after our own likeness, and let them have
   dominion over the fish of the sea, and the fowls of the air," &c.

   IV. I come now to draw some inferences or corollaries from hence, and
   they shall be partly speculative, partly practical.

   First, Speculative inferences.

   1. That God is invisible. The proper object of sight is colour, and
   that ariseth from the various dispositions of the parts of matter which
   cause several reflections of light. Now, a spirit hath no parts nor
   matter, and therefore is invisible. (1 Tim. i. 17.) "Unto the eternal,
   immortal, invisible, the only wise God." (Heb. xi. 27.) "He endured, as
   seeing him who is invisible;" as seeing him by an eye of faith, who is
   invisible by an eye of sense. (1 Tim. vi. 16.) "Whom no man hath seen,
   nor can see."

   When Moses, and the elders of Israel, are said to have seen God, and
   Jacob to have seen him face to face, (Exod. ii. 6. Gen. xxxii. 30.) it
   is meant of an angel covered with Divine glory and majesty; as we shall
   see if we compare these with other texts. When Moses is said to have
   "spoken to him face to face," that is, familiarly; and so Micaiah (1
   Kings xxii. 19.) is said to have "seen God upon his throne, and all
   Israel scattered up and down;" this was in a vision. And it is
   promised, that in heaven we shall see God; that is, have a more perfect
   knowledge of him, and full enjoyment; as, to see good days, is to enjoy
   them. Those texts, where it is said, "No man can see God and live,"
   (Exod. xxxiii. 20. and John i. 18.) "No man hath seen God at any time,"
   do not intimate that God is visible, though we cannot see him; but
   seeing is metaphorically used for knowing, and the meaning is, that in
   this life we are not capable of a perfect knowledge of God. A clear
   discovery of God to our understanding would let in joys into our souls,
   and create desires in us, too great for frail mortality to bear.

   2. That he is the living God: spirit and life are often put together in
   Scripture.

   3. That God is immortal. This the Scripture at tributes to him, (1 Tim.
   i. 17.) "To the King immortal, invisible." (1 Tim. vi. 16.) "Who only
   hath immortality." This also flows from God's spirituality; a spiritual
   nature hath no principles of corruption in it, nothing that is liable
   to perish, or decay, or die. Now this doth so eminently agree to God,
   either because he is purely spiritual and immaterial, as possibly no
   creature is; or else because he is not only immortal in his own nature,
   but is not liable to be reduced to nothing by any other, because he
   hath an original and independent immortality; and therefore the apostle
   doth attribute it to him in such a singular and peculiar manner, "who
   only hath immortality."

   Secondly, Practical inferences.

   1. We are not to conceive of God as having a body, or any corporeal
   shape or members. This was the gross conceit of the Anthropomorphites
   of old, and of some Socinians of late, which they ground upon the gross
   and literal interpretation of many figurative speeches in Scripture
   concerning God, as where it speaks of his face, and hand, and arm, &c.
   But we are very unthankful to God, who condescends to represent himself
   to us according to our capacities, if we abuse this condescension to
   the blemish and reproach of the Divine nature. If God be pleased to
   stoop to our weakness, we must not therefore level him to our
   infirmities.

   2. If God be a spirit, we are not to worship God by any image or
   sensible representation. Because God is a spirit, we are not to liken
   him to any thing that is corporeal; we are not to represent him by "the
   likeness of any thing that is in heaven above," that is, of any birds;
   "or in the earth beneath," that is, of any beast; "or in the waters
   under the earth," that is, of any fish; as it is in the second
   commandment. For, as the prophet tells us, there is nothing that we can
   liken God to; (Isa. xl. 18.) "To whom will ye liken God? or what
   likeness will ye compare to him?" We debase his spiritual and
   incorruptible nature, when we compare him to corruptible creatures.
   (Rom. i. 22, 23.) Speaking of the heathen idolatry, "Who, professing
   themselves wise, became fools, and changed the glory of the
   incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to
   birds, and to four-footed beasts, and creeping things." They became
   fools; this is the folly of idolatry, to liken a spirit, which hath no
   bodily shape, to things that are corporeal and corruptible. So that,
   however some are pleased to mince the matter, I cannot see how the
   church of Rome, which worships God by or towards some image or sensible
   representation, can be excused from idolatry; and the church of England
   doth not, without very just cause, challenge the Romish church with it,
   and make it a ground of separation from her.

   3. If God be a spirit, then we should "worship him in spirit and in
   truth." This is the inference of the text; and, therefore, I shall
   speak a little more largely of it; only I must explain what is meant by
   worshipping "in spirit and in truth," and shew you the force of this
   consequence, how it follows, that because God is a spirit, therefore he
   must be worshipped "in spirit and in truth."

   1. For the explication of it. This word spirit is sometimes applied to
   the doctrine of the gospel, and so it is opposed to letter, by which
   name the doctrine of Moses is called, (2 Cor. iii. 6.) "Who hath made
   us able ministers of the new testament, not of the letter, but of the
   spirit;" not of the law, which was written in tables of stone, but
   which Christ by his Spirit writes in the hearts of believers. Sometimes
   to the worship of the gospel; and so it is opposed to the flesh: (Gal.
   iii. 3.) "Having begun in the spirit, are ye now made perfect by the
   flesh?" that is, by the works of the ceremonial law, which is therefore
   called flesh, because the principal ceremony of it, circumcision, was
   made in the flesh, and because their sacrifices, a chief part of their
   worship, were of the flesh of beasts; and because the greatest part of
   their ordinances, as washing, and the like, related to the body. Hence
   it is the apostle calls the worship of the Jews, "the law of a carnal
   commandment," (Heb. vii. 16. and Heb. ix 10,) Carnal ordinances,
   speaking of the service of the law, "which (saith he) stood in meats,
   and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances." Now, in
   opposition to this carnal and ceremonial worship, we are to worship God
   "in the spirit." The worship of the Jews was most a bodily service; but
   we are to give God a reasonable service, to serve him with the spirit
   of our minds, as the apostle speaks; in stead of offering the flesh of
   bulls and goats, we are to consecrate ourselves to the service of God:
   "this is a holy and acceptable sacrifice," or reasonable service.

   "And in truth." Either in opposition to the false worship of the
   Samaritans (as "in spirit" is opposed to the worship of the Jews), as
   our Saviour tells the woman, that "they worshipped they knew not what;"
   or (which I rather think) in opposition to the shadows of the law; and
   so it is opposed, (John i. 17.) "The law was given by Moses, but grace
   and truth came by Jesus Christ."

   Not that the external service of God is here excluded, not that we are
   to shew no outward reverence to him; but that, as, under the law, the
   service of God was chiefly external and corporeal, so now it should
   chiefly be inward and spiritual; the worship of God, under the gospel,
   should chiefly be spiritual and substantial, not a carnal, and bodily,
   and ceremonious devotion.

   2dly, For the force of the consequence, it doth not lie in this, that
   just such as God is, such must our worship of him be; for this would
   exclude all bodily and outward worship; our worship of God must
   therefore be invisible, eternal, &c. for so is he; and besides, the
   will of God seems rather to be the rule of his worship than his nature:
   but the force of it is this; God is of a spiritual nature, and this is
   to be supposed to be his will, that our worship should be as agreeable
   to the object of it, as the nature of the creature, who is to give it,
   will bear. Now, saith Christ to the woman, the Jews and the Samaritans
   limit their worship to a certain place, and it consists chiefly in
   certain carnal rites and ordinances; but, saith he, though God have
   permitted this for a time, because of the carnality and hardness of
   their hearts, yet the time is coming, when a more spiritual, and solid,
   and substantial worship of God is to be introduced, which will be free
   from all particular places and rites; not tied to the temple, or to
   such external ceremonies, but consisting in the devotion of our
   spirits, even the inward frame and temper of our hearts; all outward
   circum stances (excepting those of the two sacraments which are
   positive) being left by the gospel to as great a liberty, as natural
   necessity and decency will permit.

   We must worship God, and therefore it is naturally necessary that we
   should do it somewhere, in some place; now seeing somebody must
   determine this, it is most convenient that authority should determine
   it according to the conveniency of cohabitation. We must not be rude,
   nor do any thing that is naturally indecent in the worship of God: this
   authority should restrain; but farther than this, I doubt not but the
   gospel hath left us free; and to this end, that the less we are tied to
   external observances, the more intent we should be upon the spiritual
   and substantial parts of religion, the conforming of ourselves to the
   mind and will of God, endeavouring to be like unto God, and to have our
   souls and spirits engaged in those duties we perform to him. So that
   our Saviour's argument is this; "God is a spirit;" that is, the most
   excellent nature and being, and therefore must be served with the best.
   We consist of body and soul, it is true, and we must serve him with our
   whole man, but principally with our souls, which are the most excellent
   part of ourselves; the service of our mind and spirit is the best we
   can perform, and therefore most agree able to God, who is a spirit, and
   the best and most perfect being.

   So that the inference is this, that if God be a spirit, we must
   "worship him in spirit and in truth;" our religion must be real, and
   inward, and sincere, and substantial: we must not think to put off God
   with external observances, and with bodily reverence and attendance;
   this we must give him, but we must principally regard that our service
   of him be reasonable, that is, directed by our understandings, and
   accompanied with our affections. Our religion must consist principally
   in a sincere love and affection to God, which expresseth itself in a
   real conformity of our lives and actions to his will; and when we make
   our solemn approaches to him, in the duties of his worship and service,
   we must perform all acts of outward worship to God with a pure and
   sincere mind; whatever we do in the service of God, we must "do it
   heartily as to the Lord." God is a pure spirit, present to our spirits,
   intimate to our souls, and conscious to the most secret and retired
   motions of our hearts: now because we serve the Searcher of hearts, we
   must serve him with our hearts.

   Indeed, if we did worship God only to be seen of men, a pompous and
   external worship would be very suitable to such an end; but religion is
   not intended to please men, but God; and therefore it must be
   spiritual, and inward, and real.

   And wherever the external part of religion is principally regarded, and
   men are more careful to worship God with outward pomp and ceremony,
   than in "spirit and in truth," religion degenerates into superstition,
   and men embrace the shadow of religion, and let go the substance. And
   this the church of Rome hath done almost to the utter ruin of
   Christianity: she hath clogged religion and the worship of God with so
   many rites and ceremonies, under one pretence or other, that the yoke
   of Christ is become heavier than that of Moses; and they have made the
   gospel a more carnal commandment than the law; and whatever Christians
   or churches are intent upon external rites and observances, to the
   neglect of the weightier parts of religion, regarding meats and drinks,
   &c. to the prejudice of righteousness and peace, wherein the kingdom of
   God consists, they advance a religion as contrary to the nature of God,
   and as unsuitable to the genius and temper of the gospel, as can be
   imagined.

   It is an observation of Sir Edwin Sands, that, as children are pleased
   with toys, so (saith he,) it is a pitiful and childish spirit that is
   predominant in the contrivers and zealots of a ceremonious religion. I
   deny not, but that very honest and devout men may be this way addicted;
   but the wiser any man is, the better he understands the nature of God
   and of religion, the farther he will be from this temper.

   A religion that consists in external and little things, cloth most
   easily gain upon and possess the weakest minds; and whoever entertain
   it, it will enfeeble their spirits, and unfit them for the more
   generous and excellent duties of Christianity. We have but a finite
   heat, and zeal, and activity; and if we let out much of it upon small
   things, there will be too little left for those parts of religion which
   are of greatest moment and concernment; if our heat evaporate in
   externals, the heart and vitals of religion will insensibly cool and
   decline.

   How should we blush, who are Christians, that we have not learned this
   easy truth from the gospel, which even the light of nature taught the
   heathen? Cultus autem deorum est optimus itemque sanctissimus atque
   castissimus, plenissimusque pietatis, ut eos semper pura integra et
   incorrupti mente et voce veneremur.--Tully. "The best, the surest, the
   most chaste, and most devout worship of the gods, is that which is paid
   them with a pure, sincere, and uncorrupt mind, and words truly
   representing the thoughts of the heart." Compositum jus fasque animi,
   &c. "Serve God with a pure, honest, holy frame of spirit; bring him a
   heart that is but generously honest, and he will accept of the plainest
   sacrifice."

   And let me tell you, that the ceremonious worship of the Jews was never
   a thing in itself acceptable to God, of which he did delight in; and
   though God was pleased with their obedience to the ceremonial law after
   it was commanded, yet antecedently he did not desire it; but that which
   our Saviour saith concerning the law of divorce, is true likewise of
   the ceremonial, that it was permitted to the Jews "for the hardness of
   their hearts," and for their proneness to idolatry. God did not command
   it so much by way of approbation, as by way of condescension to their
   weakness; it was because of "the hardness of their carnal hearts," that
   God brought them under "the law of a carnal commandment," as the
   apostle calls it. (See Psal. li. 16, 17. Jer. vii. 21.)

   The reason why I have insisted so long upon this, is, to let you
   understand what is the true nature of Christ's religion, and to abate
   the intemperate heat and zeal which men are apt to have for external
   and indifferent things in religion. The sacrifices and rites of the
   Jews, were very disagreeable and unsuitable to the nature of God.
   (Psal. l. 13.) "Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of
   goats?" Spirits neither eat nor drink; it was a very unsuitable way of
   service to kill oxen and sheep for God; and there is the same reason of
   all other rites, which either natural necessity or decency doth not
   require. Can any man in earnest think that God, who is a spirit, is
   pleased with the pompous bravery and pageantry which affects our
   senses? So little doth God value indifferent rites, that even the
   necessary external service of God, and outward reverence, where they
   are separated from spirit and truth, from real holiness and obedience
   to the indispensable laws of Christ, are so far from being acceptable
   to God, that they are abominable; nay, if they be used for a cloak of
   sin, or in opposition to real religion, and with a design to undermine
   it, God accounts such service in the number of the most heinous sins.

   You, who spend the strength and vigour of your spirits about external
   things, whose zeal for or against ceremonies is ready to eat you up;
   you, who hate and persecute one another because of these things, and
   break the necessary and indispensable commands of love, as an
   indifferent and unnecessary ceremony, "Go and learn what that means, I
   will have mercy, and not sacrifice," which our Saviour doth so often
   inculcate, and that (Rom. xiv. 17.)

   The kingdom of God is not meat and drink," &c. And study the meaning of
   this, "God is a spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in
   spirit and in truth."

SERMON CLIV.

  THE IMMENSITY OF THE DIVINE NATURE.

   Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy
   presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed
   in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning,
   and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall thy hand
   lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.--Psalm cxxxix. 7-10.

   THAT attribute of God which I last discoursed of is most absolute, and
   declares his essence most immediately--the spirituality of the Divine
   nature. I shall, in the next place, speak of those which relate to the
   manner of his being, immensity and eternity; that is, the infiniteness
   of his essence, both in respect of space and duration; that the Divine
   nature hath no limits of its being, nor bounds of its duration. I shall
   at the present speak to the first of these, his immensity, and that
   from these words which I here read to you, "Whither shall I go from thy
   Spirit," &c. The meaning of which is this, that God is a spirit
   infinitely diffusing himself, present in all places, so that wherever I
   go, God is there: we cannot flee from his presence. "If I ascend into
   heaven, he is there; if I go down into the grave, the place of silence
   and obscurity, "he is there; (for that is the meaning of the
   expression, 'if I make my bed in hell;') if I take the wings of the
   morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; ever there shall
   thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me;" that is, if my
   motion should be as swift as that of the light, which, when the sun
   riseth, darts itself in an instant from one part of the world to
   another, over the earth and the sea, the remotest parts of the world
   which are unknown to us, yet would God be present to me in the motion,
   and all along as I go must I be led and upholden by him; so that all
   these expressions do but signify to us the immensity of God's essence,
   that his being is in finitely diffused and present in all places.

   In speaking to this attribute of God's immensity, I shall, first,
   explain it to you a little.

   Secondly, Prove that it doth belong to him.

   Thirdly, Answer an objection or two that may be made against it.

   Fourthly, Draw some doctrinal inferences from it.

   Fifthly, Make some use and improvement of it.

   First, For the explication of it. By the immensity of God, I mean, that
   his being hath no bounds or limits, but doth every way spread and
   diffuse itself beyond what we can imagine; so that you cannot define
   the presence of God by any certain place, so as to say, Here he is, but
   not there; nor by any limits, so as to say, Thus far his being
   reacheth, and no farther; but he is every where present, after a most
   infinite manner, in the darkest corners and most private recesses; the
   most secret closet that is in the whole world, the heart of man,
   darkness and privacy cannot keep him out; the presence of another
   being, even of a body, which is the grossest substance, doth not
   exclude him; the whole world doth not confine him; but he fills all the
   space which we can imagine beyond this visible world, and infinitely
   more than we can imagine.

   Secondly, For the proof of it, I shall attempt it,

   I. From the natural notions and dictates of our minds.

   II. From Scripture and Divine revelation.

   III. From the inconvenience of the contrary.

   I. From the natural notions and dictates of our minds. We find that the
   heathen, by the light of nature, did attribute this perfection to God,
   Tully tells us, De Nat. Deor. that Pythagoras thought, Deum esse animam
   per naturam rerum omnem intentum et comeantem; "That God is, as it
   were, a soul passing through and inspiring all nature." And in l. 2. de
   Leg. that this was Thales's opinion which he commends, Homines
   existimare oportere deos omnia cernere, deorum omnia esse plena; "That
   men ought to believe, that the gods see all things, that all things are
   full of them." So Sen. Epist. 95. Ubique et omnibus præsto est; "He is
   every where present and at hand:" and, de Benef. l. 4. Quocunque te
   ftexeris ibi illum videbis occurrentem tibi, nihil ab illo vacat, opus
   suum ipse implet; "Which way soever thou turnest thyself, thou shalt
   find him meeting thee; nothing is without him, he fills his own work."
   Not much differing from the expression of the Psalmist here.

   II. From Scripture and Divine revelation. I shall instance in some
   remarkable places: (1 Kings viii. 27.) "Behold, the heaven, and heaven
   of heavens, cannot contain thee." (Job xi. 7-9.) "Canst thou by
   searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto
   perfection?" (Isa. lxvi. 1.) "Thus saith the Lord, Behold, heaven is my
   throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build
   unto me? and where is the place of my rest?" (Jer. xxiii. 23, 24.) "Am
   I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off? Can any hide
   himself in secret places that I shall not see him, saith the Lord? Do
   not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?" (Amos ix. 2, 3.) "Though
   they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb
   up to heaven, thence will I bring them down: and though they hide
   themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out
   thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea,
   thence will I command the serpent and he shall bite them." (Acts
   xvii.27, 28.) "Though he be not far from every one of us: for in him we
   live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets
   have said, For we are also his offspring."

   III. From the inconveniences of the contrary. And this is the most
   proper way of proving any of God's perfections; for, as I have told you
   formerly, there being nothing before God, nor any cause of his being,
   his perfections cannot be proved by way of demonstration, but of
   conviction, by shewing the absurdity of the contrary. The first and
   most easy notion that we have of God is, that he is a being which hath
   all perfection, and is free from all imperfections. Now if I prove that
   the immensity of God's essence is a perfection, or, which is the same,
   that the contrary is an imperfection, I do sufficiently prove the thing
   intended.

   Now to suppose the Divine essence to be limited or confined, and his
   presence to be any where excluded, doth contradict both this necessary
   perfection of God, his universal providence; and the necessary duty of
   creatures, to worship and trust in him; and the voluntary manifestation
   and appearance of God in the incarnation of Jesus Christ.

   1. It contradicts the universal providence of God. The universal
   providence of God supposeth many perfections; viz. infinite knowledge
   and infinite power, his omniscience and omnipotence, neither of which
   can be imagined without omnipresence. We find that all finite beings
   have a finite knowledge and a finite power; and it cannot be conceived
   how infinite understanding and power can be founded any where else than
   in an infinite essence. To have an infinite knowledge of all things,
   even those things which are most secret and hidden, to be able to do
   all things, to steer and govern the actions of all creatures, and to
   have a perfect care of them, seems, to all the reason of mankind, to
   require immediate presence.

   2. It contradicts the necessary duty of the creature, which is to
   worship God, to depend upon him for every thing, and in every thing to
   acknowledge him. Now all worship of God is rendered vain, or at least
   uncertain, if God be not present to us to hear our prayers, to take
   notice of our wants, and receive our acknowledgments: it will much
   abate our confidence in God, and our fear to offend him, if we be
   uncertain whether he be present to us or not, whether he sees our
   actions or not.

   3. It contradicts a voluntary manifestation and appearance of God in
   the incarnation of Christ. He that supposeth God not to be every where
   present by his essence, must, in all reason, confine his presence to
   heaven, and suppose him to be present elsewhere only by his virtue and
   power: but if this were so, how could the Divinity be essentially
   united to the human nature of Christ which was hereupon earth? how "is
   God with us?" How does "he pitch his tabernacle amongst men," if his
   essential presence be confined to heaven?

   Thirdly, I come to answer objections against this doctrine.

   There are two objections against this:

   1. From reason.

   2. From Scripture.

   1st Obj.--Reason will be ready to suggest, that this is a disparagement
   to the Divine nature, to tie his presence to this vile dunghill of the
   earth, and sordid sink of hell. This is a gross apprehension of God,
   and a measuring of him by ourselves. Indeed if we look upon God as
   capable of injury, and suffering, and offence, from the contagion of
   any thing here below, as we are, then, indeed, there were some strength
   in this objection: but he is a blessed and pure Being: Mens segregata
   ab omni concretione mortali; "A mind free from all mortal composition
   or mixture."--Tully. Medeni` patheto sumpeplegme'non, "Disentangled
   from every thing passable," as Plutarch. Those things that are nauseous
   to our senses do not affect him. Darkness is uncomfortable to us; but
   "the darkness and the light are all one to him." Wickedness may "hurt a
   man, or the son of man;" but "if we multiply our transgressions, we do
   nothing to God," as Elihu speaks, (Job xxxv. 6.) Nothing can disquiet
   or discompose his happy and blessed nature, but he converseth here in
   this dark and troubled world with less danger or disturbance, or any
   impure contagion, than the sun-beams.

   2d Obj.--Does not the Scripture tell us, that "God sits in the
   heavens," and "dwells on high;" that "heaven is his throne," and that
   "it is the city of the great God?" Doth not the Lord's Prayer teach us
   to say, "Our Father, which art in heaven?" Is he not said to "look down
   from heaven," and to "hear in heaven, his dwelling-place?" Is it not
   said, that "he doth not dwell in temples made with hands?" And does not
   Solomon, (1 Kings viii. 27.) put it as a strange question, "Will God
   indeed dwell on the earth?" Is he not said to come down and "draw near
   to us," and to be "afar off from us?" Now how does this agree with his
   immensity and omnipresence?

   For answer to this, I must distinguish the presence of God. There is,
   first, his glorious presence; that is, such a presence of God as is
   accompanied with an extraordinary manifestation of his glory, and that
   is especially and chiefly confined to heaven, in respect of which it is
   called his seat, and throne, and "the habitation of his glory." Some
   degree of this was in the temple, which is the reason of Solomon's
   admiration, "Will God indeed dwell on earth?"

   Secondly, There is his gracious presence, which discovers itself by
   miraculous effects of his favour, and goodness, and assistance, and
   thereby he is said to "dwell in the hearts of good men, and with them
   that are of a humble and contrite spirit;" (Isa. lvii. 15.) and, in
   respect of this, he is said to "draw near to us," to "look down upon
   us;" and, in respect of the absence of this, to be "far from us."

   Thirdly, There is his essential presence, which is equally and alike in
   all places; and this is not excluded by those former expressions, which
   the Scripture useth to denote to us the glorious and gracious presence
   of God.

   Fourthly, To make some inferences. I will mention only such as the
   Scripture here takes notice of, speaking of God's immensity.

   I. Inf.--That God is a spirit. This necessarily flows from his
   immensity; for if the essence of God be every where diffused, the
   Divine nature must be spiritual, otherwise it could not be in the same
   place where body and matter is, but must be shut, out of the world. But
   this I spoke more largely to in my discourse of God's being a spirit.
   This the Psalmist observes here, "Where shall I go from thy Spirit?" If
   he were not a spirit, we might go from him, and hide ourselves from his
   presence.

   II. Inf.--That God is incomprehensible. That which is infinite cannot
   be measured and comprehended by that which is finite; and this, also,
   the Psalmist takes notice of, in the verse before my text, "Such
   knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain to it."

   III. Inf.--That God is omniscient. If God be everywhere, then he knows
   all things; yea, even the hidden things of darkness, the secrets of our
   hearts; nothing can be hidden from an infinite eye; he is present to
   our thoughts, intimate to our hearts and reins: this the Psalmist takes
   notice of, 1-4. and 12th verses.

   IV. Inf.--That God is omnipotent. He can do all things. Distance limits
   the power of creatures, and makes their hands short; but God is every
   where, nothing is out of his reach; and this, also, the Psalmist
   intimates in the text, (ver. 10.) "Even there shall thy hand lead me,
   and thy right hand hold me."

   Fifthly, The use and improvement I shall make of this, shall be,

   1. To awaken our fear of him.

   2. To encourage our faith and confidence in him. 1. To awaken our fear
   of him. The consideration of God's presence should awaken in us a fear
   of reverence. The presence of an earthly majesty will awe our spirits,
   and compose us lo reverence; yea, the presence of a wise and good man;
   how much more should the presence of the great, and glorious, the wise,
   and the holy, and the just God, strike awe upon our spirits? Wherever
   we are, God is with us; we always converse with him, and live
   continually in his presence. Now a heathen could say, Cum diis
   verecunde agendum, "We must behave ourselves modestly, because we are
   in the presence of God."

   And it should awaken in us a fear to offend God, and a fear of the
   Divine displeasure for having offended him. Fear is the most wakeful
   passion in the soul of man, and is the first principle that is wrought
   upon in us from the apprehensions of a Deity; it flows immediately from
   the principle of self preservation which God hath planted in every
   man's nature; we have a natural dread and horror for every thing that
   can hurt us, and endanger our being or happiness. Now the greatest
   danger is from the greatest power, for where we are clearly
   over-matched, we cannot hope to make opposition nor resistance with
   security and success, to rebel with safety: now he that apprehends God
   to be near him, and present to him, believes such a Being to stand by
   him as is possessed of an infinite and irresistible power, and will
   vindicate all contempt of the Divine Majesty, and violation of his
   laws. If we believe God to be always present with us, "fear will
   continually take hold of us," and we shall say of every place, as Jacob
   did of Bethel, "Surely God is in this place, how dreadful is this
   place!" When we have at any time provoked God, if we believe the just
   God is at hand to revenge himself, and if we believe the power of his
   anger, we shall say with David, (Psal. lxxvi. 7.) "Thou, even thou, art
   to be feared, and who may stand before thee when thou art angry?"
   (Psal. cxix. 120.) "My flesh trembleth because of thee, and I am afraid
   of thy judgments."

   Sinners, consider this, "it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands
   of the living God;" and every time you sin, you are within his reach.
   Let, then, the consideration of God's presence deter us from sin, and
   quicken us to our duty. The eye and presence of a superior will lay a
   great restraint upon men; the eye of our prince, our master, or our
   father, will make us afraid or ashamed to do any thing that is foolish
   or unseemly: and will we do that under the eye of God, which we should
   blush to do before a grave or wise person, yea, before a child or a
   fool? Did but men live under this apprehension, that God is present to
   them, that a holy and all-seeing eye beholds them, they would be afraid
   to do any thing that is vile and wicked, to profane and pollute God's
   glorious name, by a trifling use of it in customary swearing and
   cursing. Whenever you sin, you affront God to his face, and provoke
   omnipotent justice, which is at the door, and ready to break in upon
   you.

   And the consideration of this should especially deter us from secret
   sins. This is the use the Psalmist here makes of it. If we believe that
   God searcheth us and knows us; that he knows our down-sitting and our
   up-rising, and understands our thoughts afar off; that he compasseth
   our path, and our lying down, and is acquainted with all our ways; that
   there is not a word in our tongue but he knows it altogether; that he
   hath beset us be hind and before; that the darkness hideth not from
   him, but the night shineth as the day, and the darkness and light are
   both alike: I say, if we believe this, how should we live in an awful
   sense of the Majesty which is always above us, and before us, and about
   us, and within us, and is as inseparable from us, as we are from
   ourselves, whose eye is upon us from the beginning of our lives to the
   end of our days! Did men believe that God is always with them, that his
   eye pierceth the darkness, and sees through all those clouds with which
   they hide and muffle themselves, and pries into the most secret
   recesses of their hearts: how would this check and restrain them from
   "devising mischief in their hearts, or in their bed-chamber!" The holy
   presence, and the pure eye of God, would be to us a thousand times more
   than to have our father, or our master, or our prince, or him whom we
   most revere, to stand by us. Did but men repræsentare sibi Deum, "make
   God present to them," by living under a continual sense of his
   presence, they would, as the expression of the wise man is, "be in the
   fear of the Lord all day." Magna spes peccatorum tollitur, si
   peccaturis testis adsistat: aliquem habeat animus quem vereatur, cujus
   auctoritate etiam secretum suum sanctius facit; "The main hope of
   sinners is to remain undiscovered; let but somebody be privy to their
   designs, and they are utterly disappointed: it is fit for the mind of a
   man to have an awe of some being, whose authority may render even its
   privacy more solemn." This is the character of wicked men; (Psal.
   lxxxvi. 14.) "That they have not God before their eyes." One great
   cause of all the wickedness, and violence, and looseness, that is upon
   the earth, is, they do not believe that God is near them and stands by
   them.

   And as the consideration of God's presence should deter us from sin, so
   it should quicken and animate us to our duty. It is ordinarily a great
   encouragement to men to acquit themselves handsomely, to have the eyes
   of men upon them, especially of those whose applause and approbation
   they value. God alone is amplum theatrum, he is "a greater theatre"
   than the world; and it should be more to us that he stands by us, than
   if the eyes of all the world were fixed upon us. Seneca adviseth it, as
   an excellent means to promote virtue, to propound to ourselves, and set
   before our eyes, some eminently virtuous person, as Cato or Lælius, Ut
   sic tanquam illo spectante vivamus, et omnia tanquam illo vidente
   faciamus: "That we may live just as if he were looking upon us, and do
   all things just as if he beheld us." How much greater incitement will
   it be to us, to think that God looks upon us, and sees us, and really
   stands by us, than faintly to imagine the presence of Lælius or Cato?

   This should have an influence upon all the duties we perform, and the
   manner of performing them, that we do it to him who stands by us, and
   is familiarly acquainted with us, and is more intimate to us than we
   are to ourselves. This Cicero, in l. 2. de Leg. looks upon as a great
   principle of religion: Sit igitur hoc persuasum civibus, et qualis
   quisque sit, quid agat, quid in se admittat, qua mente, qua pietate
   religiones colat, deos intueri, et piorum impiorumque rationem habere:
   "Let men be thoroughly persuaded of this, that the gods observe both
   the disposition and the actions of every particular man, what he
   consents to, what he allows himself in, particularly with what meaning,
   with what degree of inward devotion, he performs his religious worship;
   and that they distinguish between the pious and the impious."

   2. To encourage our faith and confidence in him. When we are in
   straits, and difficulties, and dangers, God is with us; when trouble is
   near to us, God is not far from us; wherever we are, how remote soever
   from friends and companions, we cannot be banished from God's presence;
   if we dwell "beyond the utmost parts of the sea, there his hand leads
   us, and his right hand holds us." (Psal. xvi. 8.) "I have set the Lord
   always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be
   moved." The consideration of God's presence is the great stay and
   support of our faith. (Psal. xlvi. 1, 2.) "God is our refuge and
   strength, a very present help in trouble; therefore will not we fear
   though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into
   the midst of the sea." In the greatest commotions, and the most
   imminent and threatening dangers, this should charm and allay our
   fears, that God is a present help.

   This was the support of Moses's faith in his sufferings, as the apostle
   tells us, (Heb. xi. 27.) "He endured, as seeing him who is invisible."

   To conclude all: whenever we are under any pressure or trouble, we
   should rebuke our own fears, and challenge our anxious thoughts with
   David, (Psal. xlii. 11.) "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why
   art thou so disquieted within me? trust still in God;" believe that God
   is with thee, and that omnipotent goodness stands by thee, who can and
   will support thee, and relieve thee, and deliver thee, when it seems
   best to his wisdom.

SERMON CLV.

  THE ETERNITY OF GOD.

   Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the
   earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art
   God.--Psalm xc. 2.

   THE immensity and eternity of God, are those at tributes which relate
   to his nature, or manner of being. Having spoken of the former, I
   proceed to consider the latter, from these words.

   The title of this Psalm is, "the prayer of Moses, the man of God." He
   begins his prayer with the acknowledgment of God's providence to his
   people from the beginning of the world; "Lord, thou hast been our
   dwelling-place from all generations:" "in generation and generation;"
   so the Hebrew. He was well acquainted with the history of the world,
   and the providence of God from the beginning of it; and, as if he had
   spoken too little of God, in saying, that his providence had been
   exercised in all the ages of the world, he tells us here in the text,
   that he was before the world, and he made it; he was from all eternity,
   and should continue to all eternity the same. "Before the mountains
   were brought forth," the most firm and durable parts of the world, the
   most eminent and conspicuous; "or ever thou hadst formed the earth and
   the world," before any thing was created; "from everlasting to
   everlasting, thou art God." In speaking of this attribute, I shall,

   First, Give you the explication of it.

   Secondly, Endeavour to prove that it doth be long to God, and ought to
   be attributed to the Divine nature.

   Thirdly, Draw some corollaries from the whole.

   First, For the explication of it. Eternity is a duration without bounds
   or limits: now there are two limits of duration, beginning and ending;
   that which hath always been, is without beginning; that which always
   shall be, is without ending. Now we may conceive of a thing always to
   have been, and the continuance of its being now to cease, though there
   be no such thing in the world: and there are some things which have had
   a beginning of their being, but shall have no end, shall always
   continue, as the angels and spirits of men. The first of these the
   schoolmen call eternity a parteante; that is, "duration without
   beginning;" the latter, eternity a parte post, "a duration without
   ending." But eternity, absolutely taken, comprehends both these, and
   signifies an infinite duration, which had no beginning, nor shall have
   any end: so that when we say God is eternal, we mean that he always
   was, and shall be for ever; that he had no beginning of life, nor shall
   have any end of days; but that he is "from everlasting to everlasting,"
   as it is here in the text.

   It is true, indeed, that as to God's eternity a parte ante, as to his
   having always been, the Scripture doth not give us any solicitous
   account of it; it only tells us, in general, that God was before the
   world was, and that he created it: it doth not descend to gratify our
   curiosity, in giving us any account of what God did before he made the
   world, or how he entertained himself from all eternity: it doth not
   give us any distinct account of his infinite duration; for that had
   been impossible for our finite under standings to comprehend; if we
   should have ascended upward millions of ages, yet we should never have
   ascended to the top, never have arrived at the beginning of infinity;
   therefore the Scripture, which was wrote to instruct us in what was
   necessary, and not to satisfy our curiosity, tells us this, that God
   was from everlasting, before the world was made, and that he laid the
   foundations of it.

   So that, by the eternity of God, you are to understand the perpetual
   continuance of his being, with out beginning or ending.

   I shall not trouble you with the inconsistent and unintelligible
   notions of the schoolmen; that it is duratio tota simul, in which we
   are not to conceive any succession, but to imagine it an instant. We
   may as well conceive the immensity of God to be a point, as his
   eternity to be an instant: and as, according to our manner of
   conceiving, we must necessarily suppose the immensity of God to be an
   infinite expansion of his essence, a presence of it to all places, and
   imaginable space; so must we suppose the eternity of God to be a
   perpetual continuance, co-existent to all imaginable succession of
   ages. Now, how that can be together, which must necessarily be imagined
   to be co-existent to successions--let them that can, conceive.

   Secondly, For the proof of this, I shall attempt it two ways.

   I. From the dictates of natural light and reason.

   II. From Scripture and Divine revelation.

   I. From the dictates of natural reason. This at tribute of God is of
   all others least disputed among the philosophers: indeed, all agree
   that God is a perfect and happy being; but wherein that happiness and
   perfection consists, they differ exceedingly; but all agree, that God
   is eternal, and are agreed what eternity is; viz. a boundless duration:
   and however they did attribute a beginning to their heroes and demons,
   whence come the genealogies of their gods, yet the Supreme God they
   looked upon as without beginning: and it is a good evidence, that this
   perfection doth clearly belong to God, that Epicurus, who had the
   lowest and meanest conceptions of God, and robbed him of as many
   perfections as his imperfect reason would let him, yet is forced to
   attribute this to him: Tully (de Nat. Deor. lib. 1.) saith to the
   Epicureans, Ubi igitur vestrum beatum et æternum quibus duobus verbis
   significatis Deum? "Where then is your happy and eternal being, by
   which two epithets you express God?" And Lucretius, who hath undertaken
   to represent to the world the doctrine of Epicurus, gives this account
   of the Divine nature:


   Omnis enim per se divum natura necesse est

   Immortali ævo summa cum pace fruatur:

   "It is absolutely necessary to the nature of the gods, to pass an
   eternity in profound peace and quiet."

   The poets, who had the wildest notions of God, yet they constantly give
   them the title of atha'natoi; the heathen never mention the name of
   God, with out this attribute; Dii immortales! "Immortal gods!" was
   their ordinary exclamation; and they swear constantly by this
   attribute, Deos testor immortales; and to mention no more, Tully saith
   expressly, Nos Deum nisi sempiternum intelligere qui possumus? "How can
   we conceive of God, but as an eternal Being."

   Now, the reason of this is evident, because it would be the greatest
   imperfection we could attribute to his being; and the more perfect his
   being were otherwise, the greater imperfection would it be for such a
   being to die; so excellent a nature to cease to be; it would be an
   infinite abasement to all his other perfections, his power, and wisdom,
   and goodness, that these should all be perishing; nay, it would hinder
   several of his perfections, and contradict their very being: his
   self-existence; had he not always been, he had not been of himself: his
   necessary existence; for that is not necessarily, which may at any time
   not be, or cease to be what it is: and it would much abate the duty of
   the creature; we could not have that assurance of his promise, and that
   security of the recompence of the next life, if the continuance of his
   being, who should be the dispenser of them, were uncertain.

   Now, these absurdities and inconveniences following from the denial of
   this perfection to God, is sufficient evidence that it belongs to him;
   for I told you the perfections of God cannot be proved by way of
   demonstration, but only by way of conviction., by shewing the absurdity
   of the contrary.

   II. From Scripture and Divine revelation. There are innumerable places
   to this purpose, which speak of the eternity of God directly, and by
   consequence: by consequence those words, (2 Pet. iii. 8.) "One day with
   the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day;"
   which words, however interpreters have troubled themselves about them,
   being afraid of a contradiction in them, yet the plain meaning of them
   is this--that such is the infinite duration of God, that all measures
   of time bear no proportion to it; for that this is the plain meaning
   appears by Psal. xc. out of which they are cited; "For a thousand years
   in thy sight are but as yesterday, when it is past, and as a watch in
   the night;" that is, as the time past, as a few hours slept away, for
   that is the meaning of" a watch in the night," that is as nothing. Now,
   St. Peter's conversion of the words, "One day is as a thou sand years,
   and a thousand years as one day," only signifies this, that the longest
   duration of time is so inconsiderable to God, that it is as the
   shortest that is, bears no proportion to the eternity of God.

   But directly, the Scripture frequently mentions this attribute: he is
   called the "everlasting God,: (Gen. xxi. 33.) "The eternal God," (Deut.
   xxxiii. 27.) and, which is to the same purpose, "he that inhabiteth
   eternity," (Isa. lvii. 15.) And this, as it is attributed to him in
   respect of his being, so in respect of all his other perfections,
   (Psal. ciii. 17.) "The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to ever
   lasting." (Rom. i. 20.) "His eternal power." (1 Tim. i. 17.) "The King
   eternal." Those doxologies which the Scripture useth, are but
   acknowledgments of this attribute: "Blessed be the Lord for ever and
   ever," (Neh. ix. 5.) "To whom be glory, and honour, and dominion for
   ever and ever," (Gal. i. 5.) and in many other places.

   Hither we may refer all those places which speak of him as without
   beginning; (Psal. xciii. 2.) "Thou art from everlasting." (Micah v. 2.)
   "Whose goings forth have been from everlasting." (Hab. i. 12.) "Art not
   thou from everlasting, O Lord?" And those which speak of the perpetual
   continuance of his duration, (Psal. cii. 24-27.) "Thy years are
   throughout all generations; of old thou hast laid the foundations of
   the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands: they shall
   perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a
   garment, and as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
   changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end."

   And those which speak of him "as the first and the last." (Isa. xliii.
   10.) "Before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be any
   after me. I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no
   God." And to mention no more, those which speak of his being, as
   co-existent to all difference of time, past, present, and to come:
   (Rev. i. 8.) "I am Alpha, and Omega, the beginning, and the ending,
   saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come."

   Thirdly, I shall from hence draw,

   I. Some doctrinal corollaries.

   II. Some practical inferences.

   I. Doctrinal corollaries, that you may see how the perfections of God
   depend one upon another, and may be deduced one from another.

   1st Corol.--From the eternity of God, we may infer, that he is of
   himself. That which always is, can have nothing before it to be a cause
   of its being.

   2d Corol.--We may hence infer the necessity of his being. It is
   necessary every thing should be, when it is; now that which is always
   is absolutely necessary, because always so.

   3d Corol.--The immutability of the Divine nature; for being always, he
   is necessarily; and being necessarily, he cannot but be what he is; a
   change of his being, is as impossible as a cessation. Therefore the
   Psalmist puts his immutability and eternity together: (Psal. cii. 27.)
   "But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end."

   II. By way of practical inference or application.

   1. The consideration of God's eternity may serve for the support of our
   faith. This Moses here useth as a ground of his faith; "Lord, thou hast
   been our dwelling-place in all generations; before the mountains were
   brought forth," &c. (Psal. lxii. 8.) "Trust in him at all times, ye
   people." His immensity is an argument why all should trust in him, he
   is a present help to all; and why they should trust in him at all
   times, his eternity is an argument, (Deut. xxxiii. 27.) "The eternal
   God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms." There are
   two attributes which are the proper objects of our faith and
   confidence--God's goodness, and his power; both these are eternal: "The
   goodness of the Lord endureth for ever," as it is frequently in the
   Psalms. And his power is eternal: the apostle speaks of his eternal
   power, as well as Godhead, (Rom. i. 20. Isa. xxvi. 4.) "Trust ye in the
   Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength." (Isa.
   xl. 28.) "The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the
   earth, fainteth not, neither is weary."

   We cannot trust in men, because there is no thing in man to be a
   foundation of our confidence; his good-will towards us may change, his
   power may faint, and he may grow weary; or if these continue, yet they
   that have a mind and a power to help us, themselves may fail: therefore
   the Psalmist useth this consideration of men's mortality, to take us
   off from confidence in man, (Psal. cxlvi. 3, 4.) "Put not your trust in
   princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help; his breath
   goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts
   perish." (Isa. ii. 22.) "Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his
   nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?" The greatest of the
   sons of men are but lying refuges to the everlasting God; they are but
   broken reeds to the rock of ages.

   And this may support our faith, not only in reference to our own
   condition for the future, but in reference to our posterity, and the
   condition of God's church to the end of the world. When we die, we may
   leave ours and the church in his hands, who lives for ever, and reigns
   for ever. The enemies of God's church, and those who have the most
   malicious designs against it, whatever share they may have in the
   affairs of the world, they can but domineer for a while, they must die,
   and "that very day their thoughts perish:" "But thy throne, O God, is
   for ever and ever."

   2. For the encouragement of our obedience. We serve the God who can
   give us an everlasting reward. The reward of the next life is called
   "eternal life, an eternal weight of glory," (2 Cor. iv. 17.) "Eternal
   salvation," (Heb. v. 9.) "An eternal in heritance," (Heb. ix. 15.) That
   place where good men shall be rewarded, is called "everlasting
   habitations," (Luke xvi. 9.) "A house eternal in the heavens," (2 Cor.
   v. 1.) As the promise of our future reward is founded in the goodness
   of God, and the greatness of it in his power, so the duration of it in
   his eternity. Now what an encouragement is this to us, that we serve
   him, and suffer for him, who lives for ever, and will make us happy for
   ever? When we serve the great men of this world, though we be secure of
   their affection, yet we are uncertain of their lives; and this
   discourageth many, and makes men worship the rising sun; and many times
   takes off men's eyes from the king, to his successor; but he that
   serves God, serves "the King everlasting," as the apostle calls him,
   who will live to dispense rewards to all those who are faithful to him.

   3. For the terror of wicked men. The sentence which shall be passed
   upon men at the day of judgment, is called "eternal judgment," (Heb.
   vi. 2.) because it decides men's eternal state; the punishment that
   shall follow this sentence, which shall pass upon the wicked, is called
   "everlasting punishment," (Matt. xxv. 46.) "Everlasting fire," (Matt.
   xxv. 41.) "Everlasting destruction," (2 Thess. i. 9.) "The vengeance of
   eternal fire," (Jude 7.) "The smoke of the bottomless pit," is said "to
   ascend for ever and ever," (Rev. xiv. 11.) and the wicked "to be
   tormented day and night, for ever and ever," (Rev. xx. 10.) Now as the
   punishment of wicked men is founded in the justice of God, and the
   greatness of it in his power, so the perpetuity and continuance of it
   in his eternity. The apostle saith, (Heb. x. 31.) "It is a fearful
   thing to fall into the hands of the living God;" because he that lives
   for ever, can punish for ever; as the eternal demerit of sin feeds, and
   animates, and keeps alive, the never-dying worm, so the wrath of the
   eternal God blows up the eternal flame.

   How should this awaken in us a fear of the eternal God! Sinners, what a
   folly is it, for the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season, to
   incense that justice which will punish and torment you for ever! As
   good men shall have the everlasting God for their reward, and their
   happiness, so wicked men shall have him for their judge and avenger!

   We fear the wrath of men, whose power is short, and whose breath is in
   their nostrils, who can afflict but a little, and for a little while.
   Dost thou fear "man that shall die, and the son of man that shall be
   made as grass?" And is not the wrath of the eternal God much more
   terrible? (Luke xii. 4, 5.) "And I say unto you, my friends, be not
   afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that
   they can do: but I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear; fear him, who,
   after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto
   you, fear him." The wrath of man is despicable, because it hath bounds
   and limits; the fury of man can but reach to the body, it can go no
   farther; it expires with this life, it cannot follow us beyond the
   grave: but the wrath of the eternal God doth not only reach the body,
   but the soul; it is not confined to this life, but pursues us to the
   other world, and extends itself to all eternity.

   "Fear him, who, after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell;"
   that is, to inflict eternal torments; "yea, I say unto you, fear him."

SERMON CLVI.

  THE INCOMPREHENSIBLENESS OF GOD.

   Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty
   unto perfection?--Job xi. 7.

   IN treating of the properties and perfections of God, I shall at
   present consider that which results from the infinite excellency of his
   nature and perfection, compared with the imperfection of our
   understandings, which is commonly called the incomprehensibleness of
   God. This you have expressed here in the words of Zophar, "Canst thou
   by searching find out God?"&c.

   There is no great difficulty in the words; "Canst thou by searching
   find out God?" Potesne pervestigare intima Dei, so Castalio translates
   it. Dost thou know God intimately and thoroughly, within and without?
   Canst thou pierce into the centre of his perfections, and dive into the
   bottom of them? and "Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?"
   Canst thou find out the Almighty, usque ad ultima, to the very last and
   utmost of him? so as thou canst say, after a thorough search and
   inquiry, "There is no perfection in God beyond this; there is nothing
   of him now that remains to be known; this he is, and no other; that he
   is, and no other wise; this he can do, and no more; hither doth his
   knowledge, and power, and wisdom reach, and no farther."

   Canst thou do this? These interrogations have the force of a vehement
   negation; as if he had said, No thou canst not; God is unsearchable, he
   is incomprehensible.

   The two questions in the text seem to be only two several expressions
   of the same thing. The first question is undoubtedly general,
   concerning the nature and perfections of God in general; "Canst thou by
   searching find out God?" Canst thou by the most diligent search and
   inquiry come to a perfect knowledge and understanding of him?

   The second question may seem to be a particular instance to the general
   truth implied in the first question; he seems to instance in his power,
   as if he had said, God is unsearchable, and then had instanced in a
   particular perfection, the power of God, "Canst thou by searching find
   out God?" Thou canst not comprehend the Divine nature and perfections
   in general; "Canst thou find out the Al mighty unto perfection?"
   Consider particularly his power, and see if thou canst know r the
   utmost of that. But I rather think that the latter question is
   altogether the same in sense with the former; and that the attribute of
   Almighty, which is here given to God, is used by way of description,
   and not in tended by way of instance. "Canst thou find out the
   Almighty," that is, God, "unto perfection?" Which way soever we take
   the words, it is not much material, we may ground this observation upon
   them:

   That God is incomprehensible.

   This term or attribute is a relative term, and speaks a relation
   between an object and a faculty, between God and a created
   understanding; so that the meaning of it is plainly this, that no
   created understanding can comprehend God; that is, have a perfect and
   exact knowledge of him, such a knowledge as is adequate to the
   perfection of the object. Or thus, the nature and perfections of God
   are above the understanding of any of his creatures; it is only his own
   infinite understanding that can frame a perfect idea of his own
   perfection. God knows himself, his own understanding comprehends his
   own perfections. But he is incomprehensible to his creatures.

   Indeed, there is nothing more obvious than God; for "he is not far from
   every one of us; in him we live, and move, and have our being;" there
   needs no great search to find out that there is a God: "An eternal
   power and Deity are clearly seen in the things which are made," as the
   apostle tells us; but the manner of the being, and properties, and
   perfections of this God, these cannot be comprehended by a finite
   understanding. I shall prove the doctrine, and then apply it.

   First, For the proof of it: I will attempt it these three ways:

   I. By way of instance, or induction of particulars.

   II. By way of conviction.

   III. By giving the clear reason of it.

   I. By way of instance. And I shall give you instances both on the part
   of the object, and of the subject, or the persons who are capable of
   knowing God in any degree.

   1. On the part of the object. The nature of God, the excellency and
   perfection of God, the works and ways of God, are above our thoughts
   and apprehensions. The nature of God, it is vast and infinite: (Job
   xxxvi. 26.) "God is great, and we know him not." (Job xxxvii. 23.)
   "Touching the Almighty we cannot find him out." (Psal. 3.) "His
   greatness is unsearchable."

   The excellencies and perfections of God; his immensity, (2 Chron. ii.
   6.) "The heaven of heavens cannot contain him:" the eternity of his
   duration, "from everlasting to everlasting he is God:" we cannot
   imagine any limits of his presence, nor bounds of his duration. The
   infiniteness of his knowledge: (Psal. cxlvii. 5.) "His understanding is
   infinite." When we think of the wisdom and knowledge of God, our best
   way is to fall into admiration: (Rom. xi. 35.) "O the depth of the
   riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!"

   Where the Scripture speaks of those perfections of God, which the
   creatures do in some measure and degree partake of, as his goodness,
   and power, and wisdom, and holiness, and immortality, it attributes
   them in such a peculiar and Divine manner to God, as doth exclude and
   shut out the creature from any claim, or share, or title to them:
   (Matt. xix. 16, 17.) "Why callest thou me good? there is none good but
   one, that is God." (1 Tim. vi. 15, 16.) "Who is the blessed and only
   Potentate, who only hath immortality." (1 Tim. i. 17.) "The only wise
   God." (Rev. xv. 4.) "For thou only art holy." In so inconceivable a
   manner cloth God possess these perfections which he communicates, and
   we can only understand them as he communicates them, and not as he
   possesses them; so that when we consider any of these Divine
   perfections, we must not frame notions of them contrary to what they
   are in the creature, nor must we limit them by what they are in the
   creature, but say, the goodness and the wisdom of God are all this
   which is in the creature, and much more, which I am not able to
   comprehend; the transcendent degree, and the singularity of these
   Divine perfections, which are communicable, is beyond what we are able
   to conceive.

   The works of God; they are likewise unsearchable; the works of creation
   and of redemption. (Job v. 9.) "Which doeth great things, and
   unsearchable; marvellous things, past finding out." And then he
   instanceth in the works of God, (Job xxvi. 14.) "Lo, these are part of
   his ways: but ho w little a portion is heard of him! and the thunder of
   his voice, who can understand?" So that he tells us expressly, we
   cannot find out the works of God; we do but know part of them. The
   question which he puts, (Job xxxvii. 16.) "Dost thou know the wondrous
   works of him that is perfect in knowledge?" can only be answered by the
   words of the Psalmist: (Psal. civ. 24.) "O Lord, how wonderful are thy
   works! in wisdom hast thou made them all." The work of redemption: in
   this there shines forth such wisdom, mercy, and love, as our
   understandings cannot reach. This work is called "the wisdom of God in
   a mystery; hidden wisdom," sophi'a apokekrummene, (1 Cor. ii. 7.) The
   mercy, and grace, and love of it is called, "the riches of God's mercy,
   the exceeding riches of his grace," (Eph. ii. 4. 7.) Now riches is,
   when you cannot tell the utmost of them, pauperes est numerare. (Eph.
   iii. 18, 19.) "That ye may be able to comprehend with all saints what
   is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love
   of Christ, which passeth knowledge." When we have the largest
   apprehensions of this love, so that we think we comprehend it and know
   it, it "passeth knowledge;" yea, the effects of God's power and love,
   which he manifests in believers, are unspeakable; for "he is able to do
   for us exceeding abundantly, above what we can ask or think, according
   to the power which worketh in us," (Eph. iii. 20.) The peace which
   guards their souls "passeth all understanding," (Phil. iv. 7.) Those
   "joys which fill their hearts are not to be expressed." (1 Pet. i. 8.)
   We read of "joy unspeakable and full of glory." The happiness which
   they hope for is inconceivable; it is that which "eye hath not seen,
   nor ear heard, nor hath entered into the heart of man, which God hath
   laid up for us."

   The ways of God's providence, they are not to be traced: (Psal. lxxvii.
   19.) "Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, and thy
   footsteps are not known." (Eccles. iii. 11.) "No man can find out the
   work that God maketh from the beginning to the end." We are but of
   yesterday, and know nothing. When we look upon God's providence, we
   take a part from the whole, and consider it by itself, without relation
   to the whole series of his dispensation; we cannot see the whole of
   God's providence at one view, and never see from the beginning of the
   works of God to the end; therefore our knowledge of them must needs be
   very imperfect, and full of mistakes, and false judgments of things; we
   cannot, by our petty and short-sighted designs, judge of the works of
   God, and the designs of providence; for "our ways are not as his ways,
   nor our thoughts as his thoughts; but as the heavens are high above the
   earth, so are his ways above our ways, and his thoughts above our
   thoughts," (Isa. lv. 8, 9.) The ways of God's mercy: (Psal. ciii.) "As
   the heavens are high above the earth, so great is God's mercy." (Psal;
   cxxxix. 17, 18.) "How precious are thy thoughts unto me! how great is
   the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than
   the sand." And the ways of God's judgments, the severity and greatness
   of his judgment is not known. (Psal. xc.) "Who knoweth the power of
   thine anger? and who may stand before thee when thou art angry?" And
   the reasons of his judgments are unsearchable: (Psal. xxxvi. 6.) "Thy
   judgments are a great deep." (Rom. xi. 33.) "How unsearchable are his
   judgments, and his ways past finding out!" These are the instances on
   the part of the object.

   2. On the part of the subject, or the persons capable of knowing God in
   any measure. The perfect knowledge of God is above a finite creature's
   understanding. Wicked men are ignorant of God, and full of false
   apprehensions of him. The Scripture gives this description of them:
   they are those that "know not God." (2 Thess. i.) Wicked men are so far
   from knowing God to perfection, that they have hardly any true
   knowledge of him; for as the man himself is, so will God seem to be to
   him; the idea and notions which men have of God, is but the picture of
   their own complexion. To a true knowledge there is required likeness; a
   man's mind must be like the thing he would understand; therefore the
   apostle tells us, "the natural or animal man doth not receive the
   things of God," he is not capable of them, because his mind is
   unsuitable to them; he is ple'res tou So'matos, "full of body," and he
   cannot relish spiritual things; even those natural notions which wicked
   men have of God, are strangely tinctured and obscured by the temper of
   the man; they are lux sepulta in opaca materia, "light buried and hid
   in matter and darkness," in the blackness of a foul and impure heart;
   so that there is no question of them, whether they comprehend God or
   not.

   But good men cannot find out God, they have some false apprehensions of
   him; all their apprehensions are dark, have much of obscurity in them;
   they know God to salvation, but not to perfection. In this life we do
   but know God in part; that is, in comparison of the knowledge which our
   natures are capable of.

   But I will instance yet higher: the angels, and the spirits of just men
   made perfect, though they have true apprehensions of God, yet they do
   not arrive to perfect knowledge of him, they cannot pervestigare
   ultima, "know the utmost of God;" the cherubims themselves are
   continually looking at the mercy-seat. To which the apostle alludes, (1
   Pet. i. 12.) when he tells us the mystery of God's mercy in the gospel,
   is a thing "which the angels desired to pry into." In heaven, "that
   which is in part shall be done away;" that is, our knowledge shall be
   as perfect as our natures are capable; but it shall be finite. When we
   shall "see God face to face;" that is, have an immediate vision of him,
   "and see him as he is;" that is, not having our understandings
   tinctured by any lust or passion that may darken our minds, or
   misrepresent the object; for the apostle tells us, "we shall see him,
   because we shall be like him;" yet then we shall have short and
   inadequate apprehensions of him, we shall still retain our limited
   natures and finite understandings.

   II. By way of conviction. Dost thou know perfectly the nature of a
   finite spirit, the perfection and the power of an angel, how, being
   immaterial, they can act upon the matter, and move that which can make
   no resistance to a spirit? Dost thou know how they can move themselves
   to a great distance in a moment, and dart themselves from one part of
   the world to another? Dost thou know how man is "formed in the lowest
   parts of the earth," as the Psalmist expresseth it, and the curious
   frame of our bodies is wrought from such rude principles in so dark a
   shop? Canst thou give an account how the soul is united to the body, by
   what bands or holds a spirit is so closely and intimately conjoined to
   matter? Dost thou know how thyself understandest any thing, and canst
   retain the distinct ideas and notions of so many objects without
   confusion? Dost thou know the least parts of matter how they are knit
   together; and by what cement they cleave so fast to one another, that
   they can hardly be separated?

   Now if the creatures be so unsearchable, and the knowledge of these be
   too hard for thee, is not the Creator of them much more
   incomprehensible, who possesseth all these perfections which he
   communicates, and many which cannot be communicated to a creature? If
   in natural and sensible things, maxima pars eorum quæ scimus, est
   minima pars eorum quæ nescimus; how much more is it true of God, that
   "our ignorance is more than our knowledge," when the whole earth and
   all the creatures bear no proportion to him? (Isa. xl. 15, 17.)
   "Behold, all the nations of the earth are as the drop of the bucket,
   and as the small dust of the balance; all nations before him are
   nothing, and are accounted to him less than nothing."

   III. By shewing you the clear reason of it, which is this the
   disproportion between the faculty and the object, the finiteness of our
   understandings, and the infiniteness of the Divine nature and
   perfections. "God is greater than our hearts;" and therefore as he
   knows more than we do, as the apostle reasons, (1 John iii. 20.) so he
   is more than can be known by us; he is too vast an object for our
   understanding to entertain, for our minds to receive. Thou mayest as
   well mete out the heaven with a span, and measure the waters in the
   hollow of thy hand, and comprehend the dust of the earth in a little
   urn, and weigh the mountains in scales, and the hills in a little
   balance, as think to circumscribe God in the narrow limits of thy
   thoughts, or to bring that which is infinite within the compass of that
   which is finite.

   And there is not only the vastness and greatness of the object, but the
   glory and resplendency of it does so dazzle our sight, that we cannot
   perfectly see it: (1 Tim. vi. 16.) "He dwelleth in light, which no man
   can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see." As God is too
   big, so he is too bright an object for our understandings; the presence
   of his glory overpowers our minds, and bears down our faculties, and
   conquers our understandings.

   I come now to apply this doctrine of the incomprehensibleness of the
   Divine nature. If the nature, and perfections, and ways, and works of
   God be incomprehensible, and past finding out;

   I. It calls for our admiration, and veneration, and reverence. These
   are the best apprehensions of him that is incomprehensible; a silent
   veneration of his excellencies, is the best acknowledgment of them. We
   must admire what we cannot apprehend or express, (Zech. ix. 17.) "How
   great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!" The best way to
   celebrate the praises of God, is that which Nehemiah useth, (Nehem. ix.
   5.) "And blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all
   blessing and praise." Whenever we speak or think of God, we necessarily
   detract from his perfections; but even this necessity is glorious to
   him, and this speaks his perfection, that the highest finite under
   standing must have imperfect thoughts of him.

   We should make up in reverence and veneration what we fall short of in
   knowledge. Reverence is an acknowledgment of distance; by our reverence
   of the Divine Majesty, we should best awe our hearts, in a sense of the
   distance which is between his in finite nature and perfection, and our
   finite apprehensions. Worldly greatness will cause wonder, the thoughts
   of earthly majesty will compose us to reverence; how much more should
   those excellencies which are beyond what we can imagine? (Isa. vi.) You
   have there God represented sitting upon his throne, and the seraphims
   about him, which are described to us as having "each six wings, and
   with twain they cover their faces." Creatures of the brightest
   understanding, and the most exalted purity and holiness, cover their
   faces in the presence of God's glory; they choose rather to venerate
   God, than look upon him.

   II. This calls for humility and modesty. The consideration of God's
   unsearchable perfections should make "the haughtiness of man to stoop,
   and bring down his proud looks, and God alone should be exalted." The
   thought of God's excellency should abase us, and make us "vile in our
   own eyes;" it should make all those petty excellencies that we pride
   ourselves in, to vanish and disappear. "Those treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge" which are in God, should "hide pride from man:" it should
   hide those little parts and gifts which we are so apt to glory in, as
   the sun hides the stars. When we consider God, we should be so far from
   admiring ourselves, that we should, with a humble thankfulness, wonder
   that God should regard such inconsiderable nothings as we are. (Psal.
   viii. 1, 3, 4.) "O Lord our God, how excellent is thy name in all the
   earth, who hast set thy glory above the heavens! When I consider the
   heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou
   hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of
   man, that thou visitest him?" He that considers the glory of God, and
   the greatness of his works, will think so meanly of himself, that he
   will be astonished that God should mind him or visit him. This is a
   noble strain of humility in David, by which he acknowledged that the
   great est king of the earth, how considerable soever he may be in
   respect of men, is yet but a pitiful thing to God.

   When we speak to God, we should do it with great humility. (Eccles. v.
   2, 3.) "Let thy words be few, for God is in heaven, and thou upon
   earth." We should say to God, (Job xxxvii. 19.) "Teach us what we shall
   say unto thee, for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness."
   And when we think or speak of him, we should do it with great modesty;
   we should not rashly pronounce or deter mine any thing concerning God.
   Simonides being asked what God was, desired one day's time to consider;
   then he desired two, and then four. The more we think of God, the less
   peremptory shall we be in defining him. He that considers that God is
   incomprehensible, will not pretend to know all the ways of infinite
   knowledge, and the utmost of infinite power, and all the reasons of
   God's ways and providences. He that rightly values his own short
   understanding, and the unlimited perfections of God, will not be apt to
   say, this God cannot do, this he cannot know, such ways are not
   agreeable to his wisdom. He that knows God and himself, will be modest
   in these cases; he will epe'chein, abstain from all peremptory
   pronouncing in these matters; he considers that one man many times
   differs so much from another in knowledge, and skill of working, that
   he can do those things which another believes impossible: but we have
   pitiful thoughts of God, if we think the difference between one man and
   another, is any thing to the vast distance that is between the Divine
   understanding and our ignorance, the Divine power and our weakness, the
   wisdom of God and the folly of men.

   III. The incomprehensibleness of God's perfections calls for the
   highest degree of our affection. How should we fear this great and
   glorious God! (Psal. xc. 11.) "Who knoweth the power of thine anger?
   even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath." Fear is the most infinite
   of all our passions, and fills us with the most endless jealousy and
   suspicions: God's wrath is greater than our fear; "according to thy
   fear, so is thy wrath."

   How should we love him, when we are astonished with admiration of God's
   goodness, and say, "How great is thy goodness, and how great is thy
   beauty! Behold, what manner of love the Father hath be stowed upon us!"
   How great should our love be to him! what manner of love should we
   return to him!

   This calls for the highest degree of our faith. With what confidence
   should we rely upon him, "who is able to do for us exceeding above what
   we can ask or think!"

   To conclude. This requires the highest degree of our service: how
   should our hearts be "enlarged to run the way of his commandments," who
   hath laid up for us such things, "that eye hath not seen, nor ear
   heard, nor have entered into the heart of man!"

SERMON CLVII.

  GOD THE FIRST CAUSE, AND LAST END.

   For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things; to whom be
   glory for ever. Amen.--Rom. xi. 36.

   HAVING considered the more eminent and absolute perfections of the
   Divine nature, as also that which results from the infinite excellency
   and perfection of God, compared with the imperfection of our under
   standings, I come, in the last place, to treat of such as are merely
   and purely relative: as, that he is the first cause, and the last end,
   of all things; to which purpose I have chosen these words of the
   apostle for the subject of my present discourse, "For of him, and
   through him," &c.

   The dependance of these words upon the former, is briefly this. The
   apostle had been speaking before in this chapter, several things that
   might tend to raise us to an admiration of the wisdom, and goodness,
   and mercy of God, in the dispensation of his grace for the salvation of
   men, both Jews and gentiles, and therefore would have us ascribe this
   work wholly to God; the contrivance of it to his wisdom, and not to our
   own counsels, (ver. 34.) "For who hath known the mind of the Lord; and
   who hath been his counsellor?" And the bestowing this grace to his free
   goodness and mercy, .and not to any desert of ours, (ver. 35.) "Or who
   hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?"
   Yea, and not only in the dispensation of grace, but of all good things;
   not only in this work of redemption, but also of creation; God is the
   fountain and original, and first cause, from whence every thing
   proceeds; and the last end, to which every thing is to be referred;
   "For of him," &c. ex autou, "from him," the efficient cause producing
   all things; di autou, "by or through him," as the efficient conserving
   cause of all things; kai` eis auto`n, "and to him," as the final cause
   of all things, and the end for which they were made.

   The proposition I shall speak to, is, that God is the first cause, and
   last end.

   First, I shall a little explain the terms.

   Secondly, Confirm the proposition.

   Thirdly, Apply it.

   First, For the explication of the terms.

   I. That God is the first cause, signifies,

   1. Negatively, That he had no cause, did not derive his being from any
   other, or does depend upon any other being; but that he was always, and
   eternally of himself.

   2. Positively, That he is the cause of all things besides himself, the
   fountain and original of all created beings, from whom all things
   proceed, and upon whom all things depend; or, that I may use the
   expression of St. John, (John i. 3.) which I know is appropriated to
   the second person in the Trinity, "By him all things were made, and
   without him was nothing made, that was made." So that when we attribute
   to God, that he is the first, we mean, that there was nothing before
   him, and that he was before all things, and that all things are by him.

   II. The last end.; that is, that all things refer to him; that is, the
   design and aim of all things that are made, is the illustration of
   God's glory some way or other, and the manifestation of his
   perfections.

   Secondly, For the confirmation, I shall briefly, according to my usual
   method, attempt it these two ways:

   I. By natural light. The notion of a God contains in it all possible
   perfection. Now the utmost perfection we can imagine, is, for a being
   to be al ways of itself, before all other beings; and not only so, but
   to be the cause of all other things; that is, that there should be
   nothing but what derives its being from him, and continually depends
   upon him; from whence follows, that all things must refer to him as
   their last end. For every wise agent acts with design, and in order to
   an end. Now the end is that which is best, which is most worthy the
   attaining, and that is God himself. Now his being and perfections are
   already; and the best, next to the existence of his being and
   perfections, is the manifestation of them, which is called God's glory;
   and this is the highest end that we can imagine, to which all the
   effects of the Divine power, and goodness, and wisdom, do refer.

   And that these titles are to be attributed to God, is not only
   reasonable, when it is revealed and discovered, but was discovered by
   the natural light of the heathens. Hence it was that Aristotle gave God
   those titles of the first being, the first cause, and the first mover;
   and his master Plato calls God the author and parent of all things, the
   maker and architect of the world, and of all creatures, the fountain
   and original of all things. Porphyry calls him to` proton, "the first;"
   from whence he reasons to this sense, that he is the ultimate end, and
   that all things move towards God; that all motions centre in him;
   because (saith he) it is most proper and natural for things to refer to
   their original, and to refer all to him from whom they receive all.
   Antoninus, the emperor and philosopher, speaking of nature (which with
   the Stoics signifies God) had these words, which are so very like these
   of the apostle, that they may seem to be taken from him; ek sou pa'nta,
   en soi` pa'nta, eis se` pa'nta, "Of thee are all things; in thee are
   all things; to thee are all things."

   II. From Scripture. Hither belong all those places where he declares
   himself to be "the first and the last." (Isa. xli. 4.) "Who hath
   wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the
   Lord, the first, and with the last; I am he." (Isa. xliii. 10.) "Before
   me there was no God formed, (or, as it is in the margin, there was
   nothing formed of God, ) neither shall there be after me." (Isa. xliv.
   6.) "I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no
   God." (Isa. xlviii. 12, 13.) "I am the first; I am also the last: my
   hand hath laid the foundation of the earth; my right hand hath spread
   the heavens:" which is as much as to say, he hath made the world, and
   was the first cause of all things. (Rev. i. 8.) "I am Alpha and Omega,
   the beginning and the end, saith the Lord; which is, and which was, and
   which is to come."

   But more expressly, (1 Cor. viii. 6.) "But to us there is but one God
   the Father, of whom are all things, and we by him," kai hemeis eis
   auton, "and we to him, and for him." (Acts xvii. 24.) "God, that made
   the world, and all things therein." (Ver. 25.) "He giveth to all life,
   and breath, and all things." (Ver. 28.) "In him we live, and move, and
   have our being." (Ver. 29.) "Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of
   God."

   Hither we may refer those texts which attribute the same to the second
   Person in the Trinity, as the eternal wisdom and word of God, whereby
   all things were made, (John i. 3.) "All things were made by him, and
   without him was nothing made that was made." (Ver. 10.) "And the world
   was made by him." (1 Cor. viii. 6.) "And one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
   are all things, and we by him." (Eph. iii. 9.) "God, who created all
   things by Jesus Christ." (Col. i. 16, 17.) "By him were all things
   created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
   invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
   powers; all things were created by him, and for him; and he is before
   all things, and by him all things consist." (Heb. i. 2.) "By whom also
   he made the worlds." And, (ver. 3.) "Upholding all things by the word
   of his power.

   Thirdly, and lastly, To apply this doctrine.

   Use. First, If God be the first cause of all things, who did at first
   produce all creatures, and does since preserve them, and govern them,
   and disposeth of all their concernments, and orders all things that
   befal them: from hence let us learn, .

   1. With humility and thankfulness to own, and acknowledge, and admire,
   and bless God, as the author and original of our being, as the spring
   and fountain of all the blessings and good things that we enjoy. If we
   do but consider what these words signify, that God is the first cause
   of all things, we shall see great reason to own and acknowledge, to
   adore and praise him, and that with the greatest humility, because we
   have not given him any thing, but have received all from him; he is the
   cause of all things, who did freely, and of his own good will and
   pleasure, communicate being to us without any constraint or necessity,
   but what his own goodness laid upon him. (Rev. iv. 11.) "Thou art
   worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou hast
   created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created." We
   could not before we were deserve any thing from him, or move him by any
   argument, or importune him by entreaties to make us; but he freely gave
   us being, and ever since we depend upon him, and have been preserved by
   him, and cannot subsist one moment without the continued influence of
   the power and goodness which first called us out of nothing. He is the
   author of all the good, and the fountain of all those blessings, which
   for the present we enjoy, and for the future hope for.

   When he made us at first, he designed us for happiness; and when we, by
   our sin and wilful miscarriage, fell short of the happiness which he
   designed us for, he sent his Son into the world for our recovery, and
   gave his life for the ransom of our souls. He hath not only admitted us
   into a new covenant, wherein he hath promised pardon and eternal life
   to us; but he hath also purchased these blessings for us by the most
   endearing price, the blood of his own Son, and hath saved us in such a
   manner as may justly astonish us. Upon these considerations we should
   awaken ourselves to the praise of God, and, with the holy Psalmist,
   call up our spirits, and summon all the powers and faculties of our
   souls, to assist us in this work. (Psal. ciii. 1-4, &c.) "Bless the
   Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name; bless
   the Lord, O my soul, and for get not all his benefits; who forgiveth
   all thy iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases, who redeemeth thy
   life from destruction, who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and
   tender mercies;" it is he that "satisfies our soul with good things,"
   that hath promised eternal life and happiness to us, and must confer
   and bestow this upon us; "therefore our souls, and all that is within
   us, should bless his holy name."

   2. If God be the first cause, that is, orders all things that befal us,
   and by his providence disposeth of all our concernments, this should
   teach us with patience and quietness to submit to all events, to all
   evils and afflictions that come upon us, as being disposed by his wise
   providence, and coming from him: we are apt to attribute all things to
   the next and immediate agent, and to look no higher than second causes,
   not considering that all the motions of natural causes are directly
   subordinate to the first cause; and all the actions of free creatures
   are under the government of God's wise providence, so that nothing
   happens to us besides the designs and intention of God.

   And methinks this is one particular excellency of the style of the
   Scripture above all other books, that the constant phrase of the sacred
   dialect is to attribute all events (excepting sins only) to God; so
   that every one that reads it, cannot but take notice that it is wrote
   with a more attentive consideration of God than any other book, as
   appears by those frequent and express acknowledgments of God as the
   cause of all events; so that what in other writers would be said to be
   done by this or that person, is ascribed to God. Therefore it is so
   often said, that the Lord did this and that, stirred up such an enemy,
   brought such a judgment. And we shall find that holy men, in Scripture,
   make excel lent use of this consideration, to argue themselves into
   patience and contentedness in every condition. So Eli: (1 Sam. iii.
   18.) "It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good." So Job, he did
   not so consider the Sabeans and Chaldeans, who had carried away his
   oxen and his camels, and slain his servants; nor the wind which had
   thrown down his house, and killed his sons and his daughters; but he
   looks up to God, the great governor and disposer of all these events;
   "The Lord giveth, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of
   the Lord." So David, (Psal. xxxix. 9.) "I was dumb, and spake not a
   word; because thou, Lord, didst it." So our blessed Saviour, when he
   was ready to suffer, he did not consider the malice of the Jews, which
   was the cause of his death, but looks to a higher hand; "The cup which
   my Father gives me to drink, shall not I drink it?"

   He that looks upon all things as coming from second causes, and does
   not eye the first cause, the good and wise Governor, will be apt to
   take offence at every cross and unwelcome accident. Men are apt to be
   angry, when one flings water upon them as they pass in the streets; but
   no man is offended if he is wet by rain from heaven. When we look upon
   evils as coming only from men, we are apt to be impatient, and know not
   how to bear them; but we should look upon all things as under the
   government and disposal of the first cause, and the circumstances of
   every condition as allotted to us by the wise providence of God; this
   consideration, that it is the hand of God, and that he hath done it,
   would still all the murmurings of our spirits. As when a seditious
   multitude is in an uproar, the presence of a grave and venerable person
   will hush the noise, and quell the tumult; so, if we would but
   represent God as present to all actions, and governing and disposing
   all events, this would still and appease our spirits, when they are
   ready to riot and mutiny against any of his dispensations.

   Use the second. If God be the last end of all, let us make him our last
   end, and refer all our actions to his glory. This is that which is due
   to him, as he is the first cause, and therefore he does most reasonably
   require it of us.

   And herein, likewise, the Scripture doth excel all other books; that
   is, doth more frequently and expressly mind us of this end, and calls
   upon us to propose it to ourselves as our ultimate aim and design. We
   should love him as our chief end; (Matt. xxii. 37.) "Thou shalt love
   the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with
   all thy mind." Thus to love God, is that which in the language of the
   schools is loving God as our chief end. So, likewise, the apostle
   requires that we should refer all the actions of our lives to this end:
   (1 Cor. x. 31.) "Whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God;"
   that we should "glorify him in our souls, and in our bodies, which are
   his." He is the author of all the powers that we have, and therefore we
   should use them for him; we do all by him, and therefore we should do
   all to him.

   And that we may the better understand ourselves as to this duty, I
   shall endeavour to give satisfaction to a question or two, which may
   arise about it.

   First, Whether an actual intention of God's glory be necessary to make
   every action that we do good and acceptable to God?

   Answer.--1. It is necessary that the glory of God, either formally or
   virtually, should be the ultimate end and scope of our lives, and all
   our actions; otherwise, they will be defective in that which in moral
   actions is most considerable, and that is, the end. If a man should
   keep all the commandments of the gospel, this excepted, of making God's
   glory his supreme end, only with a design to gain reputation, or some
   other advantage in the world, this very thing would vitiate all, and
   render him unacceptable to God.

   2. It is very requisite and convenient, as a good sign, that we should
   very frequently actually think upon, and intend, this end; for if it be
   very much out of our thoughts, we have some reason to be jealous of
   ourselves, that we do not intend it at all.

   3. It is so far from being necessary, that we should in every action
   have this intention of God's glory, that it is not morally possible
   that we should, no more than it is possible, that a man that goes a
   journey of a thousand miles, should every step he takes have actual
   thoughts of his journey send; nor is it more necessary; for
   consideration of the end, is only so far necessary, as it is necessary
   to guide and quicken us in the use of means; as it is not necessary for
   a man to think of his journey's end, farther than to direct and excite
   him to go thither. And this appears farther by the contrary; it is not
   necessary to make a sinful action, that a man should formally, much
   less actually, intend God's dishonour; it is enough to constitute a man
   a wicked man, if he willingly transgress God's law, the doing whereof
   does, by consequence, reflect a dishonour upon him; so, on the other
   hand, it is sufficient to make an action good and acceptable, if it be
   conformable to God's law, and such as by consequence redounds to God's
   glory.

   Second question. Whether the glory of God may or ought to be considered
   as an end separate and distinct from our own happiness?

   Answer.--I shall speak but briefly to this, because I have elsewhere
   spoken to it; but in that little which I have to say for satisfaction
   to this question, I will proceed by these steps:

   I. By the glory of God, we mean the demonstration, or illustration, or
   manifestation, of some or alt of his perfections, more especially his
   goodness, and mercy, and justice, and wisdom, and power, and holiness.

   II. It is plain, that the manifestation of some of these perfections is
   a thing that may be separated from the happiness of a creature; for his
   holiness, and justice, and power, may and shall be manifested in the
   final and eternal ruin of impenitent sinners.

   III. The manifestation of any of God's perfections, ought many times to
   be propounded by us as an end distinct and separate from our respective
   happiness; such a happiness as respects only some particulars, and some
   particular duration, in opposition to absolute and eternal happiness.
   In this sense our Saviour says, that he "sought not his own glory, but
   the glory of him that sent Him:" by which he does not mean, that he
   quitted everlasting glory and happiness; but that, in order to the
   glory of God, he did for a time lay aside his own glory, and divest
   himself of it while he was in this world; for the apostle tells us,
   that he was encouraged to do this out of a respect to a greater glory.
   (Heb. xii. 2.) "Who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the
   cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
   throne of God." And in this sense we are to understand the command of
   self-denial in the gospel, with reference to our particular or
   temporal, not our eternal interest; and that it is no more, is plain
   from the argument our Saviour uses to encourage this self-denial, the
   promise of a far greater happiness than that we deny; no man that
   "forsakes father or mother for my sake, but shall have eternal life:"
   and proportionably we are to understand those commands of loving Christ
   more than ourselves; that is, more than any temporal interest.

   IV. The manifestation of any of God's perfections, neither ought nor
   can reasonably be propounded by us as an end separated from, or
   opposite to our eternal blessedness; that is, we cannot naturally or
   reasonably desire the glory of God should be advanced, though it were
   to our final ruin, either by annihilation or eternal misery.

   1. We cannot, either naturally or reasonably, desire God should be
   glorified by our annihilation.

   (1.) Not naturally. Because such a desire would be directly contrary to
   the natural desire of self-preservation, which God himself hath planted
   in us, and is most intimate and essential to our nature,

   (2.) Not reasonably. Because it is utterly unimaginable how God can be
   glorified by the annihilation of a creature. All the attributes that we
   can imagine can be manifested herein, are power ad sovereignty; his
   power hath already been as much manifested in creating .and making the
   creature out of nothing, as it can be by reducing it into nothing; for
   to create, is the very same demonstration of power as to annihilate.
   And as for his sovereignty, God will never manifest that in
   contradiction to his goodness, or wisdom, or any other perfection of
   the Divine nature. To unmake a creature, and take away the being which
   he had given, would argue either a failure of his goodness toward the
   creature, or that he did repent that he had made it, which would
   reflect upon his wisdom and constancy. I do not say, that injustice God
   cannot annihilate a creature; far be it from me: for what he gave was
   his own, and he might without any wrong to the creature take it again.

   2. Much less can we naturally desire that God should be glorified in
   our eternal misery. The reasons which I give about annihilation are
   stronger here; therefore we cannot naturally desire it, nor reasonably,
   for the demonstration of his power, or sovereignty, or justice, or
   holiness, which, I think, are all the attributes which we can imagine
   to be glorified hereby: not as the manifestation of his power; for that
   would be as much manifested in the happiness, as misery of the
   creature: not of his sovereignty; for God will not manifest that in
   contradiction to his goodness, upon which nothing can reflect more,
   than merely, pro arbitrio, for his pleasure, to make an innocent
   creature for ever miserable: not his justice and holiness; for these
   presuppose sin and demerit in the creature, out of hatred to which he
   makes it miserable; but God hath declared that he esteems himself more
   glorified by the obedience and happiness of his creatures, than by
   their sin and destruction; and if it were reasonable to desire the
   justice and holiness of God might be glorified in my eternal ruin,
   which I have deserved by sin; this would plainly follow from it, that
   it were reasonable to sin, that justice might abound: which of the two
   is a greater absurdity than that which the apostle condemns of "sinning
   that grace may abound."

   V. There is a strict and inviolable connexion between the greatest
   glory of God and our obedience and happiness; I say, between his
   greatest glory, because he esteems himself more glorified by the
   obedience and happiness of his creatures, than by their ruin and
   misery: and that we may believe it, we have his oath for it; "As I
   live, saith the Lord, I delight not in the death of a sinner, but
   rather that he should turn and live." And it is observable, that the
   apostle, in 1 Cor. x. 31-33, "Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye
   do, do all to the glory of God: giving none offence, neither to the
   Jews, nor to the gentiles, nor to the church of God: even as I please
   all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of
   many, that they may be saved;" explains the glorifying of God, by
   edifying and promoting the salvation of others.

   VI. We may consider the glory of God, as some ways distinct from our
   happiness; that is, we may consider the manifestation of his goodness,
   and mercy, and wisdom, in our happiness, as that which results from it;
   but this is not enough to make it a distinct end, but the same
   diversely considered; as the public good is that which results from the
   general good of particular persons, but cannot reasonably be propounded
   by any man, as an end distinct from the general happiness of particular
   persons, without ruining and destroying the notion of public good.

   VII. Though considered as we are particular beings, we can have no
   greater end than our own happiness, in which God is eminently
   glorified; yet, as we are part of the whole creation and workman ship
   of God, which is the noblest consideration of ourselves, the glory of
   God, which results from the manifestation of all his perfections in and
   about his creatures, is precisely our ultimate end, and yet not an end
   really distinct from our own happiness; and therefore, it is most
   proper, and becoming, and agreeable to the wise style of Scripture, to
   give our end its denomination, not from the more particular and narrow,
   but the more noble consideration of ourselves, as we are parts of the
   whole creation and workmanship of God; as it is more generous and
   becoming for the members of a civil society to mention the public good
   as their end, than their private happiness and advantage, though that
   be so really and effectually promoted by the public good.

   Thus I have finished what I proposed on this argument, and concerning
   the attributes of God in general; "Of whom, and through whom, and to
   whom, are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen."

SERMON CLVIII.

  THE NECESSITY OF REPENTANCE AND FAITH.

   Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward
   God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.--Acts xx. 21.

   TO have seen St. Paul in the pulpit, was one of those three things
   which St. Augustine thought worth the wishing for. And sure it were
   very desirable to have seen this glorious instrument of God, who did
   such wonders in the world, to have heard that plain and powerful
   eloquence of his, which was so "mighty through God, for the casting
   down of strong holds, and the subduing of men to the obedience of the
   gospel;" to have beheld the zeal of this holy man, who was all on tire
   for God, with what ardency of affection, and earnestness of expression,
   he persuaded men to come in to Christ, and entertain the gospel. This
   were very desirable; but seeing it is a thing we cannot hope for, it
   should be some satisfaction to our curiosity, to know what St. Paul
   preached, what was the main subject of his sermons, whither he referred
   all his discourses, and what they tended to. This he tells us in the
   words that I have read to you, that the main substance of all his
   sermons was "Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus
   Christ."

   The occasion of the words was briefly this; St. Paul being in his
   journey to Jerusalem, and intending to be there by the day of
   Pentecost, that he might not be hindered in his journey, he resolves to
   pass by Ephesus, and only to call to him the elders of the church, to
   charge them with their duty, and the care of the church; and to engage
   them hereto, he tells them how he had carried and demeaned himself
   among them, (ver. 18.) with what diligence and vigilance he had watched
   over them, with what affection and earnestness he had preached to them,
   (ver. 19, 20.) And here in the text he tells them what had been the sum
   of his doctrine, and the substance of those many sermons he had
   preached among them, and what was the end and design of all his
   discourses; viz. To persuade men to "repentance toward God, and faith
   toward our Lord Jesus Christ; testifying both to the Jews and Greeks,"
   &c.

   I shall explain the words a little, and then fix upon the observations
   which I intend to speak to, because I design this only as a preface to
   some larger discourses of faith and repentance.

   For explication. "Testifying," the word is diamarturo'menos, which
   signifies to testify, to prove a thing by testimony; so it is used,
   (Heb. ii. 6.) "But one in a certain place testifieth, saying." In
   heathen writers the word is often used in a law sense, for contesting
   by law, and pleading in a cause; and from hence it signifies earnestly
   to contend or persuade by arguments and threatenings. In the use of the
   LXX. it signifies to protest, to convince, to press earnestly, to
   persuade. It is used most frequently by St. Luke in a very intense
   signification; and is sometimes joined with exhorting, which is an
   earnest persuading to a thing, (Acts ii. 40.) "And with many other
   words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this
   untoward generation;" and with preaching, (Acts viii. 25.) "And when
   they had testified and preached the word of the Lord;" and so (Acts
   xviii. 5.) "Being pressed in spirit, he testified to the Jews that
   Jesus was the Christ," "Being pressed in spirit" signifies intention
   and vehemency in testifying to them, that he did vehemently endeavour
   to convince them; it seems to be equivalent to the expression, (ver.
   28.) where it is said, "Apollos did mightily convince the Jews that
   Jesus was the Christ;" that is, did use such persuasions and arguments
   as were sufficient to convince; and to mention no more, (Acts xxviii.
   23.) "He expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them
   concerning Jesus."

   St. Paul, in his Epistle to Timothy, useth this word in a most vehement
   sense, for giving a solemn charge, (1 Tim. v. 21.) "I charge thee
   before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ;" the word is diamartu'romai; and
   so (2 Tim. ii. 14.) "Charging them before the Lord, that they strive
   not about words;" and so (2 Tim. iv. 1.) "I charge thee before God, and
   the Lord Jesus Christ;" and here in the text the word seems to be of a
   very high and intense signification, because of the circumstances
   mentioned before and after; he tells us before, that he taught them "at
   all seasons," (ver. 18.) "publicly, and from house to house," (ver.
   20.) And afterwards, at the 31st verse, that "he warned them day and
   night with tears." So that "testifying to the Jews repentance and
   faith," must signify his pressing and persuading of them with the
   greatest vehemency to turn from their sins, and believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ; his charging on them these things as their duty, his
   pleading with them the necessity of faith and repentance, and earnestly
   endeavouring to convince then) thereof.

   "Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ:" what
   is the reason of this appropriation of repentance and faith, the one as
   properly respecting God, and the other our Lord Jesus Christ? I answer:
   Repentance doth properly respect God, because he is the party offended,
   and to whom we are to be reconciled; the faith of the gospel doth
   properly refer to the Lord Jesus Christ, as the chief and principal
   object of it; so that by "testifying to them repentance toward God,"
   &c. we are to understand that the apostle did earnestly press and
   persuade them to repent of their sins, whereby they had offended God,
   and to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as the Messias, the person that
   was ordained of God, and sent to be the Saviour of the world.

   From the words thus explained, this is the observation that doth
   naturally arise,

   That repentance and faith are the sum and substance of the gospel; and
   that ministers ought with all earnestness and vehemency to press people
   to repent and believe, to charge them with these as their duty, and by
   all means to endeavour to convince them of the necessity of them.

   In the handling of this I shall do these two things:

   First, Shew you what is included in repentance and faith, that you may
   see that they are the sum of the gospel. And,

   Secondly, Shew you the necessity of them.

   First, What is included in these.

   I. Repentance: this properly signifies a change of mind, a conviction
   that we have done amiss, so as to be truly sorry for what we have done,
   and heartily to wish that we had not done it. To repent, is to alter
   our mind, to have other apprehensions of things than we had, to look
   upon that now as evil which we did not before; from whence follows
   sorrow for what we have done, and a resolution of mind for the future
   not to do again that which appears now to us to be so evil, that we are
   ashamed of it, and troubled for it, and wish we had never done it. So
   that repentance implies a conviction that we have done something that
   is evil and sinful, contrary to the law we are under, and those
   obligations of duty and gratitude that lie upon us, whereby God is
   highly provoked and in censed against us, and we in danger of his
   wrath, and the sad effects of his displeasure; upon which we are
   troubled, and grieved, and ashamed for what we have done, and wish we
   had been wiser, and had done otherwise: hereupon we resolve never to do
   any thing that is sinful, that is contrary to our duty and obligations
   to God, and by which we may provoke him against us. These two things
   are contained in a true repentance, a deep sense of, and sorrow for,
   the evils that are past, and the sins we have committed; and a firm
   purpose and resolution of obedience for the future, of abstaining from
   all sin, and doing whatever is our duty: the true effect of which
   resolution, is the breaking off the practice of sin, and the course of
   a wicked life, and a constant course of obedience.

   II. Faith in Christ is an effectual believing the revelation of the
   gospel, the history and the doctrine of it: the history of it--that
   there was such a person as Jesus Christ; that he was the true Messias,
   prophesied of and promised in the Old Testament; that he was born, and
   lived, and preached, and wrought the miracles that are recorded; that
   he was crucified and rose again, and ascended into heaven; that he was
   the Son of God, and sent by him into the world, by his doctrine to
   instruct, and by the example of his life to go before us in the way to
   happiness, and by the merit and satisfaction of his death and
   sufferings, to appease and reconcile God to us, and to purchase for us
   the pardon of our sins and eternal life, upon the conditions of faith,
   and repentance, and sincere obedience; and that to enable us to the
   performance of these conditions, he promised and afterward sent his
   Holy Spirit to accompany the preaching of his gospel, and to assist all
   Christians to the doing of that which God requires of them: this is the
   history of the gospel.

   Now the doctrine of it contains the precepts, and promises, and
   threatenings of it, and faith in Christ includes a firm belief of all
   these; of the precepts of the gospel as the matter of our duty, and the
   rule of our life: and of the promises and threatenings of the gospel,
   as arguments to our duty, to encourage our obedience, and deter us from
   sin. So that he that believes the Lord Jesus, believes him to be the
   great guide and teacher sent from God, to bring and conduct men to
   eternal happiness, and that therefore we ought to hearken to him and
   follow him; this is to believe his prophetical office. He believes that
   he is the author of salvation, and hath purchased for us forgiveness of
   sins, ransom from hell, and eternal life and blessedness upon the
   conditions beforementioned, and therefore that we ought to rely upon
   him only for salvation, to own him for our Saviour, and to beg of him
   his Holy Spirit, which he hath promised to us, to enable us to perform
   the conditions required on our part: this is to believe his priestly
   office. And, lastly, he believes that the precepts of the gospel, being
   delivered to us by the Son of God, ought to have the authority of laws
   upon us, and that we are bound to be obedient to them; and for our
   encouragement, if we be so, that there is a glorious and eternal reward
   promised to us; and for our terror, if we be not, there are terrible
   and eternal punishments threatened to us; to which rewards, the Lord
   Jesus Christ, at the day of judgment, will sentence men, as the great
   Judge of the world: and this is to believe the kingly office of Christ.
   And this is the sum of that which is meant by "faith toward the Lord
   Jesus Christ," which the apostle saith was one subject of his
   preaching.

   And the proper and genuine effect of this faith, is to live as we
   believe, to conform our lives to the doctrine, to the truth whereof we
   assent. Hence it is that true Christians, that is, those who fashioned
   their lives according to the gospel, are called believers; and the
   whole of Christianity is many times contained in this word believing,
   which is the great principle of a Christian life. As in the Old
   Testament all religion is expressed by "the fear of God;" so in the
   New, by "faith in Christ."

   And now you see what is included in repentance and faith, you may
   easily judge, whether these be not the sum of the gospel, that men
   should forsake their sins and turn to God, and believe in the
   revelation of the gospel concerning Jesus Christ; that is, heartily
   entertain and submit to it. What did Christ preach to the Jews, but
   that they should repent of their sins, and believe on him as the
   Messias? And what did the apostles preach, but to the same purpose?
   When St. Peter preached to the Jews, (Acts ii.) the effect of the
   sermon and the scope of it was to persuade them "to repent and be
   baptized in the name of Jesus, that is, to profess their belief in him,
   (ver. 38.) And so (Acts iii. 19.) this is the conclusion of his
   discourse, "Repent therefore and be converted;" and then he propounded
   Christ to them as the object of their faith, being the great prophet
   that was prophesied of by Moses, who should "be raised up among them,"
   (ver. 22.) So, likewise, St. Paul, when he preached to the Jews and
   gentiles, these were his great subjects, (Acts xvii. 30.) This is the
   conclusion of his sermon to the Athenians, to persuade them to repent
   by the consideration of a future judgment, and to persuade them to
   believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was to be the judge of the world,
   from the miracle of his resurrection: "But now he commands all men
   every where to repent, because he hath appointed a day, &c. whereof he
   hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the
   dead." So that you see that these are the great doctrines of the
   gospel, and were the sum of the apostles preaching; all their sermons
   were persuasives to these two duties of repentance and faith.

   Secondly, For the necessity of these doctrines. They are necessary for
   the escaping of eternal misery, and attaining of everlasting happiness.
   And this will appear, by considering the nature of them, and the
   relation they have to both these.

   For the avoiding of eternal punishment, it is necessary that guilt
   should be removed, which is an obligation to punishment, and that
   cannot be but by pardon: and sure we cannot imagine that God will ever
   pardon us without repentance: he will never remit to us the punishment
   of sin, so long as we tell him we are not at all troubled for what we
   have done, and we are of the same mind still, and will do the same
   again; and till we repent, we tell God this, and we may be sure God
   will not cast away his pardons upon those that despise them; so that
   repentance is necessary to the escaping of hell.

   And faith in Christ is necessary to it; for if this be the method of
   God's grace, not to pardon sin without satisfaction, and Jesus Christ
   hath made satisfaction for sin by the merit of his sufferings; and if
   it be necessary that we should believe this, that the benefit hereof
   may redound to us; then faith in Christ is necessary to the obtaining
   of the pardon of sin, by which the guilt of sin is removed; that is,
   our obligation to eternal punishment.

   And then for attaining salvation. Christ having in the gospel revealed
   to us the way and means to eternal happiness, it is necessary that we
   should believe this revelation of the gospel by Jesus Christ, in order
   to this end. So that you see the necessity of faith and repentance:
   because without these we can neither escape misery, nor attain to
   happiness.

   I should now come to draw some inferences from this discourse, but I
   will first give satisfaction to a query or two, to which this discourse
   seems to have given occasion.

   1st Query.--You will say, why do I call repentance a doctrine of the
   gospel? It is a doctrine of nature. Natural religion tells us, that
   when we have offended God we ought to be sorry for it, and resolve to
   amend and reform.

   Answer.--I do not make the doctrine of repentance proper to the gospel,
   as if it had not been revealed to the world before; but because it is a
   doctrine which the gospel very much presseth and persuadeth men to, and
   because the great motives and enforcements of it are peculiar to the
   gospel. So that the doctrine of repentance, considered with those
   powerful reasons and arguments to it which the gospel furnisheth us
   withal, is in this sense proper to the gospel, and not known to the
   world before.

   There are two motives and enforcements to repentance which the gospel
   furnisheth us with.

   1. Assurance of pardon and remission of sins in case of repentance,
   which is a great encouragement to repentance, and which, before the
   gospel, the world had never any firm and clear assurance of.

   2. Assurance of eternal rewards and punishments after this life, which
   is a strong argument to persuade men to change their lives, that they
   may avoid the misery that is threatened to impenitent sinners, and be
   qualified for the happiness which it promiseth to repentance and
   obedience. And this, the apostle tells us in the forementioned place
   (Acts xvii. 30, 31.) is that which doth, as it were, make repentance to
   be a new doctrine that did come with the gospel into the world, because
   it was never before enforced with this powerful argument; "The times of
   that ignorance God winked at; but now he calls upon all men every where
   to repent; because," &c. When the world was in ignorance, and had not
   such assurance of a future state, of eternal rewards and punishments
   after this life, the arguments to repentance were weak and feeble in
   comparison to what they now are; the necessity of this duty was not so
   evident. But now God hath assured us of a future judgment, now
   exhortations to repentance have a commanding power and influence upon
   men: so that repentance, both as it is that which is very much pressed
   and inculcated in the gospel, and as it hath its chief motives and
   enforcements from the gospel, may be said to be one of the great
   doctrines of the gospel.

   Query 2.--Whether the preaching of faith in Christ, among those who are
   already Christians, be at all necessary? Because it seems very improper
   to press those to believe in Christ, who are already persuaded that he
   is the Messias, and do entertain the history and doctrine of the
   gospel.

   Answer.--The faith which the apostle here means, and which he would
   persuade men to, is an effectual belief of the gospel; such a faith as
   hath real effects upon men, and makes them to live as they believe;
   such a faith as persuades them of the need of these blessings that the
   gospel offers, and makes them to desire to be partakers of them, and in
   order thereto to be willing to submit to those terms and conditions of
   holiness and obedience which the gospel requires. This is the faith we
   would persuade men to, and there is nothing more necessary to be
   pressed upon the greatest part of Christians than this; for how few are
   there among those who profess to believe the gospel, who believe it in
   this effectual manner, so as to conform themselves to it? The faith
   which most Christians pretend to, is merely negative; they do not
   disbelieve the gospel, they do not consider it, nor trouble themselves
   about it; they do not care, nor are concerned whether it be true or
   not; but they have not a positive belief of it, they are not possessed
   with a firm persuasion of the truth of those matters which are
   contained in it; if they were, such a persuasion would produce real and
   positive effects. Every man naturally desires happiness, and it is
   impossible that any man that is possessed with this belief, that, in
   order to happiness, it is necessary for him to do such and such things;
   and that if he omit or neglect them, he is unavoidably miserable, that
   he should not do them. Men say they believe this or that, but you may
   see in their lives what it is they believe. So that the preaching of
   this faith in Christ, which is the only true faith, is still necessary.

   I. Inference.--If repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, be the sum and substance of the gospel, then from hence we may
   infer the excellency of the Christian religion, which insists only upon
   those things which do tend to our perfection and our happiness.
   Repentance tends to our recovery, and the bringing of us back as near
   as may be to innocence. Primus innocentiæ gradus est non peccasse:
   secundus, poenitentia: and then faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, though
   it be very comprehensive, and contains many things in it, yet nothing
   but what is eminently for our advantage, and doth very much conduce to
   our happiness. The historical part of the gospel acquaints us with the
   person and actions of our Saviour, which conduceth very much to our
   understanding of the author and means of our salvation. The doctrinal
   part of the gospel contains what God requires on our part, and the
   encouragements and arguments to our duty, from the consideration of the
   recompence and rewards of the next life. The precepts of Christ's
   doctrine are such as tend exceedingly to the perfection of our nature,
   being all founded in reason, in the nature of God, and of a reasonable
   creature; I except only those positive institutions of the Christian
   religion, the two sacraments, which are not burthensome, and are of
   excellent use. This is the first.

   II. We may learn from hence what is to be the sum and end of our
   preaching, to bring men to repentance and a firm belief of the gospel:
   but then it is to be considered, that we preach repentance, so often as
   we preach either against sin in general, or any particular sin or vice;
   and so often as we persuade to holiness in general, or to the
   performance of any particular duty of religion, or to the exercise of
   any particular grace; for repentance includes the forsaking of sin, and
   a sincere resolution and endeavour of reformation and obedience. And we
   preach repentance, so often as we insist upon such considerations and
   arguments, as may be powerful to deter men from sin, and to engage them
   to holiness. And we preach faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, so
   often as we declare the grounds of the Christian religion, and insist
   upon such arguments as tend to make it credible, and are proper to
   convince men of the truth and reasonableness of it; so often as we
   explain the mystery of Christ's incarnation, the history of his life,
   death, resurrection, ascension, and intercession, and the proper ends
   and use of these; so often as we open the method of God's grace for the
   salvation of sinners, the nature of the covenant between God and us,
   and the conditions of it, and the way how a sinner is justified and
   hath his sins pardoned, the nature and necessity of regeneration and
   sanctification; so often as we explain the precepts of the gospel, and
   the promises and threatenings of it, and endeavour to convince men of
   the equity of Christ's commands, and to as sure them of the certainty
   of the eternal happiness which the gospel promises to them that obey
   it, and of the eternal misery which the gospel threatens to those that
   are disobedient; all this is preaching faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.

   III. This may correct the irregular humour and itch in many people, who
   are not contented with this plain and wholesome food, but must be
   gratified with sublime notions and unintelligible mysteries, with
   pleasant passages of wit, and artificial strains of rhetoric, with nice
   and unprofitable disputes, with bold interpretations of dark
   prophecies, and peremptory determinations of what will happen next
   year, and a punctual stating of the time when antichrist shall be
   thrown down, and Babylon shall fall, and who shall be employed in this
   work. Or, if their humour lies another way, you must apply yourself to
   it, by making sharp reflections upon matters in present controversy and
   debate; you must dip your style in gall and vinegar, and be all satire
   and invective against those that differ from you, and teach people to
   hate one another, and to fall together by the ears; and this men call
   gospel preaching, and speaking of seasonable truths.

   Surely St. Paul was a gospel preacher, and such an one as may be a
   pattern to all others, and yet he did none of these; he preached what
   men might understand, and what they ought to believe and practise, in a
   plain, and unaffected, and convincing manner; he taught such things as
   made for peace, and whereby he might edify and build up men in their
   holy faith. The doctrines that he preached will never be unseasonable,
   that men should leave their sins, and believe the gospel, and live
   accordingly.

   And if men must needs be gratified with disputes and controversies,
   there are these great controversies between God and the sinner to be
   stated and determined; whether this be religion, to follow our own
   lusts and inclinations, or to endeavour to be like God, and to be
   conformed to him, in goodness and mercy, and righteousness, and truth,
   and faithfulness? Whether Jesus Christ be not the Messias and Saviour
   of the world? Whether faith and repentance and sincere obedience be not
   the terms of salvation, and the necessary conditions of happiness?
   Whether there shall be a future judgment, when all men shall be
   sentenced according to their works? Whether there be a heaven and hell?
   Whether good men shall be eternally and unspeakably happy, and wicked
   men extremely and ever lastingly miserable? These are the great
   controversies of religion, upon which we are to dispute on God's behalf
   against sinners. God asserts, and sinners deny these things, not in
   words, but, which is more emphatical and significant, in their lives
   and actions. These are practical controversies of faith, and it
   concerns every man to be resolved and determined about them, that he
   may frame his life accordingly.

   And so for repentance; God says, repentance is a forsaking of sin, and
   a thorough change and amendment of life; the sinner says, that it is
   only a formal confession, and a slight asking of God forgiveness: God
   calls upon us speedily and forthwith to repent; the sinner saith, it is
   time enough, and it may safely be deferred to sickness or death: these
   are important controversies, and matters of moment. But men do not
   affect common truths; whereas these are most necessary: and, indeed,
   whatever is generally useful and beneficial, ought to be common, and
   not to be the less valued, but the more esteemed for being so.

   And as these doctrines of faith and repentance are never unseasonable,
   so are they more peculiarly proper when we celebrate the holy
   sacrament, which was instituted for a solemn and standing memorial of
   the Christian religion, and is one of the most powerful arguments and
   persuasives to repentance and a good life.

   The faith of the gospel doth more particularly respect the death of
   Christ, and therefore it is called "faith in his blood," because that
   is more especially the object of our faith; the blood of Christ, as it
   was a seal of the truth of his doctrine, so it is also a confirmation
   of all the blessings and benefits of the new covenant.

   And it is one of the greatest arguments in the world to repentance. In
   the blood of Christ we may see our own guilt, and in the dreadful
   sufferings of the Son of God, the just desert of our sins; for "he hath
   borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; he was wounded for our
   transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities:" therefore, the
   commemoration of his sufferings should call our sins to remembrance,
   the representation of his body broken should melt our hearts; and so
   often as we remember that his blood was shed for us, our eyes should
   "run down with rivers of tears;" so often as we "look upon him whom we
   have pierced, we should mourn over him." When the Son of God suffered,
   "the rocks were rent in sunder;" and shall not the consideration of
   those sufferings be effectual to break the most stony and obdurate
   heart?

   What can be more proper when we come to this sacrament, than the
   renewing of our repentance? When we partake of this passover, we should
   "eat it with bitter herbs." The most solemn expressions of our
   repentance fall short of those sufferings which our blessed Saviour
   underwent for our sins. If "our head were waters, and our eyes
   fountains of tears," we could never sufficiently lament the cursed
   effects and consequences of those provocations which were so fatal to
   the Son of God.

   And that our repentance may be real, it must be accompanied with the
   resolution of a better life; for if we return to our sins again, "we
   trample under foot the Son of God, and profane the blood of the
   covenant," and out of "the cup of salvation we drink our own
   damnation," and turn that which should save us into an instrument and
   seal of our own ruin.

SERMON CLIX.

    [Preached on Ash Wednesday.]

  OF CONFESSING AND FORSAKING SIN, IN ORDER TO PARDON.

   He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and
   forsaketh them shall have mercy.--Prov. xxviii. 13.

   SINCE we are all sinners, and liable to the justice of God, it is a
   matter of great moment to our comfort and happiness, to be rightly
   informed, by what means, and upon what terms, we may be reconciled to
   God, and find mercy with him. And to this purpose the text gives us
   this advice and direction: "Whoso confesseth and forsaketh his sins
   shall have mercy."

   In which words there is a great blessing and benefit declared and
   promised to sinners, upon certain conditions. The blessing and benefit
   promised is the mercy and favour of God, which comprehends all the
   happy effects of God's mercy and goodness to sinners: and the
   conditions upon which this blessing is promised are two--confession of
   our sins, and forsaking of them; and these two contain in them the
   whole nature of that great and necessary duty of repentance, without
   which a sinner can have no reasonable hopes of the mercy of God.

   I. Here is a blessing or benefit promised, which is the mercy and
   favour of God: and this, in the full extent of it, comprehends all the
   effects of the mercy and goodness of God to sinners, and doth primarily
   import the pardon and forgiveness of our sins. And this, probably,
   Solomon did chiefly in tend in this expression; for so the mercy of God
   doth most frequently signify in the Old Testament; viz. the forgiveness
   of our sins. And thus the prophet explains it: (Isa. lv. 7.) "Let the
   wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let
   him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy; and to our God, for
   he will abundantly pardon."

   But now, since the clear revelation of the gospel, the mercy of God
   doth not only extend to the pardon of sin, but to power against it;
   because this also is an effect of God's free grace and mercy to
   sinners, to enable them, by the grace of his Holy Spirit, to master and
   mortify their lusts, and to persevere in goodness to the end.

   And it comprehends also our final pardon and absolution at the great
   day, together with the glorious reward of eternal life, which the
   apostle expresseth, by "finding mercy with the Lord in that day." And
   this likewise is promised to repentance: (Acts iii. 19.) "Repent ye,
   therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when
   the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord, and
   he shall send Jesus Christ, who before was preached unto you;" that is,
   that when Jesus Christ, who is now preached unto you, shall come, you
   may receive the final sentence of absolution and forgiveness.

   And thus much shall suffice to have been spoken of the blessing and
   benefit here promised--the mercy of God; which comprehends all the
   blessed effects of the Divine grace and goodness to sinners, the
   present pardon of sin, and power to mortify sin, and to persevere in a
   good course, and our final ab solution by the sentence of the great
   day, together with the merciful and glorious reward of eternal life.

   II. We will consider, in the next place, the conditions upon which this
   blessing is promised; and they are two, the confessing and forsaking of
   our sins: "Whoso confesseth and forsaketh his sin, shall have mercy:"
   and these two do contain and constitute the whole nature of repentance,
   without which a sinner can have no reasonable hopes to find mercy with
   God. I begin with the

   First, The confession of our sins; by which is meant a penitent
   acknowledgment of our faults to God; to God, I say, because the
   confession of our sins to men is not, generally speaking, a condition
   of the forgiveness of them, but only in some particular cases, when our
   sins against God are accompanied and complicated with scandal and
   injury to men. In other cases, the confession of our sins to men is not
   necessary to the pardon of them, as I shall more fully shew in the
   progress of this discourse.

   All the difficulty in this matter is, that the confession of our sins
   is opposed to the covering and concealing of them: "He that covereth
   his sin shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth them shall have mercy."
   But no man can hope to hide his sin from God, and therefore confession
   of them to God cannot be here meant. But this objection, if it be of
   any force, quite excludeth confession to God, as no part of Solomon's
   meaning; when yet confession of our sins to God is granted on all hands
   to be a necessary condition of the forgiveness of them. And to take
   away the whole ground of this objection; men are said in Scripture,
   when they do not confess their sins and repent of them, to hide and
   conceal them from God: not to acknowledge them, is as if a man went
   about to cover them. And thus David opposeth confession of sins to God,
   to the hiding of them: (Psal. xxxii. 5.) "I acknowledged my sin unto
   thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I said, I will confess my
   transgressions unto the Lord." So that this is no reason why the text
   should not be understood of the confessing of our sins to God.

   But because the necessity of confessing our sins to men (that is, to
   the priest), in order to the forgiveness of them, is a great point of
   difference between us and the church of Rome, it being by them esteemed
   a necessary article of faith, but by us, so far from being necessary to
   be believed, that we do not believe it to be true; therefore, for the
   clear stating of this matter, I shall briefly inquire into these two
   things:

   I. Whether confession of our sins to the priest, as taught and
   practised in the church of Rome, be necessary to the forgiveness of
   them.

   II. How far the disclosing and revealing of our sins to the ministers
   of God is convenient upon other accounts, and for other purposes of
   religion.

   I. Whether confession of our sins to the priest, and the manner in
   which it is taught and practised in the church of Rome, be necessary to
   the forgiveness of them. What manner of confession this is, the council
   of Trent hath most precisely determined; viz. "Secret confession to the
   priest alone of all and every mortal sin, which, upon the most diligent
   search and examination of our consciences, we can remember ourselves to
   be guilty of since our baptism; together with all the circumstances of
   those sins, which may change the nature of them; because without the
   perfect knowledge of these, the priest cannot make a judgment of the
   nature and quality of men's sins, nor impose fitting penance for them."
   This is the confession of sins required in the church of Rome, which
   the same council of Trent, without any real ground from Scripture or
   ecclesiastical antiquity, doth most confidently affirm, "to have been
   instituted by our Lord, and by the law of God to be necessary to
   salvation, and to have been al ways practised in the catholic church."

   I shall, as briefly as I can, examine both these pretences, of the
   Divine institution, and constant practice of this kind of confession.

   First, For the Divine institution of it, they mainly rely upon three
   texts; in the first of which there is no mention at all of confession,
   much less of a particular confession of all our sins, with the
   circumstances of them; in the other two there is no mention of
   confession to the priest: and yet all this ought clearly to appear in
   these texts, before they can ground a Divine institution upon them; for
   a Divine institution is not to be founded upon obscure consequences,
   but upon plain words.

   The first text, and the only one upon which the council of Trent
   grounds the necessity of confession, is John xx. 23. "Whose soever sins
   ye remit, they are remitted; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are
   retained." It is a sign they were at a great loss for a text to prove
   it, when they are glad to bring one that hath not one word in it
   concerning confession, nor the least intimation of the necessity of it.

   But let us see how they manage it to their purpose. The apostles and
   their successors (saith Bellarmine) by this power of remitting and
   retaining sins, are constituted judges of the case of penitents; but
   they cannot judge without hearing the cause; and this infers particular
   confession of sins to the priest, from whence he concludes it necessary
   to the forgiveness of sins.

   But do not the ministers of the gospel exercise this power of remitting
   sins in baptism? And yet particular confession of all sins to the
   priest is not required, no not in the church of Rome, in the baptism of
   adult persons. And therefore, according to them, particular confession
   of sin to the priest is not necessary to his exercising the power of
   remitting sins, and consequently the necessity of confession cannot be
   concluded from this text.

   And to shew how they are puzzled in this mat ter, Vasquez, by a strange
   device, concludes the necessity of confession from the power of
   retaining sins; for (says he) if the priest have a power of retaining
   sins, that is, of denying pardon and absolution to the penitent, then
   he may impose confession as a condition of forgiveness, and not absolve
   the penitent upon other terms. But supposing the priest to have this
   unreasonable power, this makes confession no otherwise necessary by
   Divine institution, than going to Jerusalem or China is, in order to
   the forgiveness of our sins, or submitting to any other foolish
   condition that the priest thinks fit to require: for according to this
   way of reasoning, this power of retaining sins, makes every foolish
   thing that the priest shall impose upon the penitent, to be necessary
   by Divine command and institution.

   But the truth is, this power of remitting and retaining sins, is
   exercised by the ministers of the gospel, in the administration of the
   sacraments, and the preaching of the gospel, which is called the word
   of reconciliation, the ministry whereof is committed to them. And thus
   the ancient fathers understood it; and as a great divine told them in
   the council of Trent, it was, perhaps, never expounded by any one
   father concerning the business of confession.

   The second text they allege to this purpose is, (1 John i. 9.) "If we
   confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins."
   Here, indeed, is confession; but general, not particular, as appears by
   the opposition, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
   and the truth is not in us: but if we confess our sins;" that is, if we
   acknowledge ourselves to have been sinners. And then there is not a
   word of confessing to the priest; the confession here meant is plainly
   to God, because it follows, "he is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins;" that is, God, who is necessarily understood in the former part
   of the sentence, as if it had run thus, "If we confess our sins to God,
   he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins."

   The third text is, (Jam. v. 16.) "Confess your faults one to another,
   and pray one for another." And here again there is only mention of
   confession, but not a word of the priest; and for another reason, if I
   had been to advise them, they should not have pressed this text for
   their service in this cause, because it does them as much hurt as good;
   for it is certain, the duty of confession here enjoined is reciprocal
   and mutual, "Confess your sins one to another:" so that if, by virtue
   of this text, the people are bound to confess their sins to the priest,
   the priest is hereby as much obliged to confess his sins to the people;
   which, I dare say, is more than they have a mind to prove from this
   text. The plain meaning whereof is this--that as Christians should be
   ready to perform all mutual offices of charity, so to assist and
   comfort one another by their counsel and prayers. And therefore the
   apostle adviseth Christians when they are sick, if at the same time
   they be under any spiritual trouble, by reason of the guilt of any sin
   lying upon their consciences, to lay open their case to one another,
   that so they may have the help of one another's advice and prayers;
   "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye
   may be healed," both of your bodily and spiritual distemper. Not that
   the priest or minister is here excluded; St. James had spoken of that
   particular before, that when "any was sick," he should "send for the
   elders of the church," that he might, in the first place, have the
   benefit of their counsel and prayers; and then, because private
   Christians may also be useful to one another in this kind, he adds,
   that they should also lay open their condition and troubles "to one
   another," that so they might have the help of one another's advice and
   prayers; and very probably all the confession here meant of private
   Christians "to one another," is of the offences and injuries they may
   have been guilty of one towards another; that they should be reconciled
   upon this occasion, and, as a testimony of their charity, should "pray
   one for another;" whereas they are bound "to send for the elders of the
   church," and they are "to pray over them," as an act, not only of
   charity, but of superiority, and by virtue of their office in the
   church, a more especial blessing being to be expected from their
   prayers. These three texts are the main arguments from Scripture, which
   they, of the church of Rome, bring to prove their auricular or secret
   confession to be of Divine institution; and woful proofs they are;
   which shews what miserable shifts they are reduced to, who resolve to
   maintain a bad cause.

   I proceed, in the second place, to discover the falsehood of their
   other pretences, that this kind of confession hath always been
   practised in the catholic church: and not only so, but believed
   absolutely necessary to the remission of men's sins, and their eternal
   salvation.

   The truth of the whole matter is this; public confession and penance
   for open and scandalous crimes was in use, and with great strictness
   observed, in the first ages of Christianity; and there was then no
   general law, or custom, that exacted secret confession of sins to the
   priest, as a necessary part of repentance, and condition of
   forgiveness: afterward public penance was by degrees disused; which
   plainly shews, that, in the opinion of the church, this discipline, how
   useful soever, was not of absolute necessity to restore men to the
   favour of God.

   In place of this came in private confession to the priest, particularly
   appointed to this office, and called the penitentiary; but, upon
   occasion of a scandal that happened, this also was abrogated by
   Nectarius, bishop of Constantinople; which shews that neither was this
   necessary. And this act of Nectarius was justified by his successor St.
   Chrysostom, who does, over and over, most expressly teach, that
   confession of our sins to men is not necessary to the forgiveness of
   them, but that it is sufficient to confess them to God alone; so that
   St. Chrysostom does plainly stand condemned by the decrees of the
   council of Trent.

   And thus, for several ages, the matter rested, till the degeneracy of
   the church of Rome, growing to wards it height, about the ninth and
   tenth centuries, some began to contend for the necessity of secret
   confession; and this, in the year 1215, in the fourth council of
   Lateran, under Pope Innocent III. was decreed and established.

   And this is the first public law that was made in the Christian church
   concerning this matter, not withstanding all the boasts of the council
   of Trent, about the antiquity of this institution and practice; for
   Gratian, who lived about fifty years before this council, tells us,
   that in his time several wise and religious men were of the contrary
   opinion, and did not hold confession necessary by virtue of any Divine
   law. Afterwards, in the council of Florence, and especially in that of
   Trent, this decree of the council of Lateran was confirmed and enlarged
   in many particulars, of which I have already given some account.

   And whereas they pretend for themselves, the universal practice not
   only of the past but present church, we are able to shew from clear
   testimony of their own writers, that confession, as taught and
   practised in the church of Rome, is no where else in use at this day,
   neither among the Abyssines, nor Indians of St. Thomas, nor the
   Nestorians, nor the Armenians, nor the Jacobites, churches of great
   antiquity and vast extent. And as for the Greek church, if we may
   believe Gratian, and the author of the gloss upon the canon law, the
   Greeks had anciently no tradition concerning the necessity of
   confession, nor do they at this day agree with the Roman church in all
   points concerning it.

   So that, in short, there is no nation nor church throughout the whole
   world, that bears the name of Christian, the Roman church only
   excepted, that doth fully embrace and maintain the whole doctrine of
   the council of Trent, concerning confession; and yet, according to
   their principles, the whole is of equal necessity to be believed, as
   any part of it. With what face, then, do they declare, that this manner
   of confession always was, and still is, observed in the catholic, that
   is, in the whole Christian church?

   I have not time to shew the great and manifold inconveniences and
   mischiefs of this practice: how infinite a torture it is to the
   consciences of men, by entangling them in endless doubts and scruples;
   and how great a scandal it is to the Christian profession, in the lewd
   management of it by the priests, is evident from the two bulls of Pope
   Pius IV. and Gregory XV. which mention things too shameful to be
   declared; not to insist upon other horrible abuses of it to the vilest
   and wickedest purposes; not so much to direct the consciences of men,
   as to dive into their secrets, of which there are so many plain and
   notorious instances, that they are past denial.

   The other thing pretended for it is, that it is a great restraint upon
   men from sin. And very probably it is so to modest and well-disposed
   persons; but experience shews how quite contrary an effect it hath upon
   others, who are the far greatest part of mankind. Does not all the
   world see in the popish countries, in the time of their carnival, just
   before Lent, the anniversary season of confession, how scandalous a
   liberty men take of doing lewd and wicked things; and that for this
   very reason, because their consciences are presently to be eased and
   scoured (as they call it) by confession and absolution? And they
   therefore take the opportunity to gratify their lusts, and fill up the
   measure of their iniquity at that time, because with one labour they
   can set their consciences right, and clear them of all guilt. And they
   look upon this as a special piece of spiritual good husbandry, to quit
   their scores with God at once, that so they may have no occasion to
   trouble him, nor the priest, nor themselves again for a good while
   after. So that confession, instead of being a restraint from sin, gives
   great encouragement to it, by deluding men into a vain hope of
   obtaining the pardon of their sins from time to time, though they still
   continue in the practice of them; by which device, men's sins are at
   once remitted and retained; the priest remits them by ab solution, and
   the penitent retains them, by going on still in the commission of them,
   in hope of obtaining a new absolution as often as occasion shall
   require. I proceed to the

   II. Second inquiry, namely, How far the disclosing and revealing our
   sins to the ministers of God may be convenient upon other accounts, and
   to other purposes of religion? To which the answer is very plain and
   short; so far as is necessary, either to the direction, or the ease of
   men's consciences.

   There are many cases wherein men under the guilt and trouble of their
   sins, can neither appease their own minds, nor sufficiently direct
   themselves, without recourse to some pious and prudent guide; in these
   cases, men certainly do very well, and many times prevent a great deal
   of trouble and perplexity to themselves, by a timely discovery of their
   condition to some faithful minister, in order to their direction and
   satisfaction, without which they shall never, perhaps, be able to clear
   themselves of the obscurity and entanglement of their own minds; but,
   by smothering their trouble in their own breasts, shall proceed from
   one degree of melancholy to another, till at last they be plunged
   either into destruction or despair; whereas the discovery of their
   condition in time, would prove a present and effectual remedy. And to
   this purpose, a general confession is for the most part sufficient; and
   where there is occasion for a more particular discovery, there is no
   need of raking into the particular and foul circumstances of men's
   sins, to give that advice which is necessary for the cure and ease of
   the penitent; a thing so far from being desirable, that it must needs
   be very grievous to every modest and good man.

   And thus far confession is not only allowed, but encouraged among
   protestants. In the Lutheran churches, Chemnitius tells us, that
   private general confession is in use and practice. And Calvin freely
   declares, that he is so far from being against people's repairing to
   their pastors to this purpose, that he earnestly wisheth it were every
   where observed before the receiving of the sacrament. And the same is
   the sense of our own church, laying no necessity upon men in this
   matter, but advising, especially before the sacrament, those who have
   any trouble upon their consciences, to repair to some discreet and
   faithful minister of God's word, for advice and satisfaction. And thus
   all the good use which can be made of confession may be had in our
   church, without the ill effects and consequences of the Romish
   confession, and without laying a yoke upon the consciences of men which
   our Saviour never laid.

   And now I have, as briefly and as plainly as I could, stated this
   controversy between us and the church of Rome, concerning the necessity
   and use of secret confession to the ministers of God, as the proper
   guides and directors of our consciences. But it is granted on all
   hands, that confession of our sins to God is necessary; and there is no
   doubt but it is here intended in the text, viz. a penitent
   acknowledgment of our sins; the nature whereof I shall briefly explain
   to yon.

   And it must not only be a general confession that we are sinners, but
   there must be a particular acknowledgment of our sins to God, so far
   as, upon a particular discussion and examination of our consciences, we
   can call them to remembrance; especially our most heinous sins, which
   our consciences will not suffer us to forget, must be particularly
   acknowledged, with the several aggravations of them.

   And this confession must be accompanied with such a shame and sorrow
   for our sins, as produceth in us a sincere resolution to leave them,
   and to be take ourselves to a better course. These are the principal
   ingredients of a penitent confession.

   1. There must be a shame, without which there is no hope of amendment.
   Confession always supposeth conviction of a fault; and he that is truly
   convinced that he hath done amiss, cannot but be ashamed of what he
   hath done. And thus the penitents in Scripture were wont to make
   confession of their sins to God: (Ezra ix. 6.) "O my God, (says he) I
   am ashamed, and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God." So Jeremiah;
   (chap. iii. 25.) "We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth
   us; for we have sinned against the Lord." And so, likewise, Daniel:
   (chap. ix. 5.) "We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and done
   wickedly; unto us belongeth confusion of face." And thus our Saviour
   describes the penitent behaviour of the publican, as ashamed to look up
   to that God whom he had offended; (Luke xviii. 13.) "He would not lift
   up so much as his eyes to heaven; but smote upon his breast, saying,
   God be merciful to me a sinner."

   2. Confession must be always accompanied with great sorrow for our
   sins, considering the great dishonour we have brought to God, and the
   danger into which we have brought ourselves; "I will declare mine
   iniquity (says David), and I will be sorry for my sin."

   And this sorrow must be proportionable to the degree of our sin. If we
   have been very wicked, and have sinned greatly against the Lord, and
   "have multiplied our transgressions," and continued long in an evil
   course, have neglected God, and "forgotten him days without number,"
   the measure of our sorrow must bear some proportion to the degree of
   our sins: if they have been as scarlet and crimson (as the prophet
   expresseth it), that is, of a deeper die than ordinary, our sorrow must
   be as deep as our guilt; for it is not a slight trouble, and a few
   tears, that will wash out such stains.

   Not that tears are absolutely necessary, though they do very well
   become, and most commonly accompany, a sincere repentance. All tempers
   are not in this alike; some cannot express their sorrow by tears, even
   then when they are most inwardly and sensibly grieved. But if we can
   easily shed tears upon other occasions, certainly "rivers of tears"
   ought to "run down our eyes," because we have broken God's laws, the
   reasonable, and righteous, and good laws of so good a God, of so
   gracious a sovereign, of so mighty a benefactor, of the founder of our
   being, and the perpetual patron and protector of our lives: but if we
   cannot command our tears, there must, however, be great trouble and
   contrition of spirit, especially for great sins; to be sure to that
   degree as to produce the

   3. Third property I mention of a penitent confession; namely, a sincere
   resolution to leave our sins, and betake ourselves to a better course.
   He does not confess his fault, but stand in it, who is not resolved to
   amend. True shame and sorrow for our sins, is utterly inconsistent with
   any thought of returning to them. It argues great obstinacy and
   impudence to confess a fault and continue in it. Whenever we make
   confession of our sins to God, "surely it is meet to say unto him, I
   will not offend any more; that which I know not, teach thou me; and if
   I have done iniquity, I will do no more."

   This is the first part of repentance mentioned in the text, the first
   condition of our finding mercy with God, the penitent acknowledgment of
   our sins to him. I proceed to the

   Second condition required to make us capable of the mercy of God, which
   is the actual forsaking of our sins; "Whoso confesseth and forsaketh
   them, shall have mercy." I shall not go about to explain what is meant
   by forsaking sin; it is that which everybody can understand, but few
   will do; there lies all the difficulty: I shall only put you in mind,
   that forsaking of sin comprehends our return to our duty, that
   necessarily follows from it. In sins of commission, he that hath left
   any vice, does thereby become master of the contrary virtue. Virtus est
   vitium fugere; not to be drunk, is to be sober; not to oppress, or
   defraud, or deal falsely, is to be just and honest: and for sins of
   omission, the forsaking of them is nothing else, but the doing of those
   duties which we omitted and neglected before. And therefore what
   Solomon here calls forsaking of sin, is elsewhere in Scripture more
   fully expressed, by "ceasing to do evil, and learning to do well,"
   (Isa. i. 16.) By forsaking our sins, and turning to God: (Isa. lv. 7.)
   "Let the wicked man forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his
   thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord." By turning from all our
   sins, and keeping all God's laws and statutes: (Ezek. xviii. 21.) "If
   the wicked will turn from all his sins which he hath committed, and
   keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right."

   And this is a most essential part of repentance, and a necessary
   condition of our finding mercy with God. That part of repentance which
   I have mentioned and insisted upon before, the penitent acknowledgment
   of our sins to God, with shame and sorrow for them, and a firm purpose
   and resolution to leave them; all this is but preparatory to the actual
   forsaking of them: that which perfects and completes our repentance, is
   to turn from our evil ways, and to break off our sins by righteousness.

   And these terms, of confessing and forsaking our sins, are reasonable
   in themselves, and honourable to God, and profitable to us; and upon
   lower terms we have no reason to expect the mercy of God, nor, in
   truth, are we capable of it, either by the present forgiveness of our
   sins, or the final absolution of the great day, and the blessed reward
   of eternal life. God peremptorily requires this change as a condition
   of our forgiveness and happiness; "Repent and be converted, that your
   sins may be blotted out," (Acts iii. 19.) "If thou wilt enter into
   life, keep the commandments," (Matt. xix. 17.) "With out holiness no
   man shall see the Lord." And why should any man hope for the mercy of
   God upon other terms than those which he hath so plainly and
   peremptorily declared?

   It is a mean and unworthy thought of God, to imagine that he will
   accept men to his favour and eternal life upon other terms than of
   better obedience. Will any wise father or prince accept less from his
   children and subjects? Will they be satisfied with sighs and tears, as
   well as with obedience; and well-pleased if they be but melancholy for
   their faults, though they never mend them? We must not impute that to
   God, which would be a defect of wisdom and good government in any
   father or prince upon earth. God values no part of repentance upon any
   other account, but as it tends to reclaim us to our duty, and ends in
   our reformation and amendment.

   This is that which qualifies us for the happiness of another life, and
   "makes us meet to be made partakers of the inheritance of the saints in
   light." And without this, though God should be pleased to forgive us,
   yet we could not forgive ourselves; and notwithstanding the legal
   discharge from guilt, the sting of it would remain, and we should, like
   our first parents, after they had sinned, run away and hide ourselves
   from God, though he spake never so kindly to us. God hath placed in
   every man's mind an inexorable judge, that will grant no pardon and
   forgiveness but to a reformed penitent, to him that hath such a sense
   of the evil of his past life, as to be come a better man for the
   future.

   And whoever entertains any other notion of the grace and mercy of God
   to sinners, confounds the nature of things, and does plainly overthrow
   the reason of all laws, which is to restrain men from sin; but when it
   is committed, to pardon it with out amendment, is to encourage the
   practice of it, and to take away the reverence and veneration of those
   laws, which seem so severely to forbid it. So that, next to impunity,
   the forgiveness of men's sins upon such easy and unfit terms gives
   boldness and encouragement to sin, and must necessarily, in the opinion
   of men, lessen the honour and esteem of God's laws.

   And thus I have considered and explained both the blessing and benefit
   which is here promised and declared, viz. the mercy and favour of God,
   which comprehends both the present forgiveness of our sins, and power
   against them, and grace to persevere in goodness to the end, and our
   final absolution at the great day, and the glorious and merciful reward
   of eternal life: and likewise the conditions upon which this blessing
   is promised; viz. the penitent acknowledgment of our sins to God, with
   such shame and sorrow for them, as produceth a sincere resolution of
   leaving them, and returning to a better course, and the actual
   forsaking of them, which involves in it our actual return to our duty,
   and a constant and sincere obedience to the laws of God in the future
   course of our lives.

   I shall now make some application of this discourse to ourselves. I am
   sure we are all nearly concerned in it. The best of us have many sins
   to confess and forsake; some of us very probably have need to change
   the whole course of our lives, to put us into a capacity of the mercy
   of God. This work can never be unseasonable; but there cannot be a more
   proper time for it, than when we are solemnly preparing ourselves to
   receive the holy sacrament; in which, as we do commemorate the great
   mercy of God to mankind, so we do likewise renew and confirm our
   covenant with him; that holy covenant, wherein we engage ourselves to
   forsake our sins, as ever we expect the forgiveness of them at God's
   band.

   To persuade us hereto, be pleased to consider the reasonableness of the
   thing, the infinite benefit and advantage of it; and, which is beyond
   all other arguments, the absolute necessity of it, to make us capable
   of the mercy and forgiveness of God in this world and the other, and to
   deliver us from the wrath which is to come, and from those terrible
   storms of vengeance, which will infallibly fall upon impenitent
   sinners: so that we have all the reason, and all the encouragement in
   the world, to resolve upon a better course. Upon this condition, the
   mercy of God is ready to meet and embrace us; God will pardon our
   greatest provocations, and be perfectly reconciled to us. So he hath
   declared by the prophet: (Isaiah i. 16.) "Wash ye, make you clean: put
   away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
   learn to do well. Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord;
   though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though
   they be red as crimson, they shall be as wool." And what greater
   encouragement can we desire, than that, upon such easy and advantageous
   terms, God should be so ready to have an end put to all controversies
   and quarrels between him and us?

   "I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God," to take up
   a serious resolution, "to break off your sins by repentance," and to
   reform whatever, upon due search and trial of your ways, you shall find
   to be amiss in your lives.

   "I beseech you by the mercies of God," that mercy which naturally leads
   to repentance, and which "is long-suffering to us-ward," on purpose
   that "we may not perish, but come to repentance;" which hath spared us
   so often, and is not yet exhausted and tired out by our intolerable
   obstinacy, and innumerable provocations; that mercy which moved the Son
   of God to become man, to live among us, and to die for us; who now, as
   it were, speaks to us from the cross, extending his pierced hands, and
   painful arms to embrace us, and, through the gasping wounds of his
   side, lets us see the tender and bleeding compassion of his heart; that
   mercy, which, if we now despise it, we shall in vain one day implore,
   and catch hold of, and hang upon, to save us from sinking into eternal
   perdition; that mercy, which, how much soever we now presume upon, will
   then be so far from inter posing between us and the wrath of God, that
   it will highly inflame and exasperate it. For whatever impenitent
   sinners may now think, they will then certainly find that the Divine
   justice, when it is thoroughly provoked, and whetted by his abused
   mercy and goodness, will be most terribly severe, and, like a razor set
   with oil, will cut the keener for its smoothness.

   "Consider this all ye that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, and
   there be none to deliver: consider and shew yourselves men, O ye
   transgressors!"

   We do consider all this, (some may perhaps say) but we have been great
   sinners, so great, that we doubt whether our case be not already
   desperate.

   This, if it be sensibly said, with deep sorrow and contrition, with
   that shame and confusion of face which becomes great offenders, is a
   good confession, and the best reason in the world, why ye should now
   break off your sins: for if what you have already done, do really make
   your case so doubtful and difficult, do not, by sinning yet more and
   more against the Lord, make it quite desperate and past remedy; do but
   you repent, and God will yet return and have mercy upon you. And do not
   say you cannot do it, when it must be done, or you are undone. Power
   and necessity go together: when men are hard pressed, they find a power
   which they thought they had not; and when it comes to the push, men can
   do that which they plainly see they either must do, or be ruined for
   ever.

   But, after all this, I am very sensible how great a need there is of
   God's powerful assistance in this case, and that it is not an ordinary
   resolution and common measure of God's grace, that will reclaim those
   who have been long habituated to an evil course.

   Let us, therefore, earnestly beg of him, that he would make these
   counsels effectual, that he would grant us repentance unto life, that
   he would make us all sensible of our faults, sorry for them, and
   resolved to amend them; and let us every one put up David's prayer to
   God for ourselves, "Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy, and
   teach me thy statutes. Order my steps in thy word, and let not any
   iniquity have dominion over me. Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy
   statutes, that I may keep them unto the end."

   I have now done; I am only to mind you of another duty, which is to
   accompany our repentance, and fasting, and prayer, as a testimony of
   the sincerity of our repentance, and one of the best means to make our
   fasting and prayer acceptable to God, and to turn away his judgments
   from us; and that is charity and alms to the poor, whose number is very
   great among us, and their necessities very pressing and clamorous, and
   therefore do call for a bountiful supply.

   And to convince men of the necessity of this duty, and the efficacy of
   it in conjunction with our repentance, and fasting, and prayers, I
   shall only offer to your consideration a few plain texts of Scripture,
   which need no comment upon them. (Dan. iv. 27.) It is the prophet's
   advice to Nebuchadnezzar; "Break off thy sins by righteousness, and
   thine iniquity by shewing mercy to the poor; if so be it may be a
   lengthening of thy tranquillity." (Acts x. 4.) The angel there tells
   Cornelius, "Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial
   before God." (Isa. lviii. 6, &c.) "Is not this the fast which I have
   chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,
   and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it
   not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that
   are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover
   him; and that thou hide not thyself from thy own flesh? Then shall thy
   light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth
   speedily, and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of
   the Lord shall be thy rereward: then shalt thou call, and the Lord
   shall answer thee; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am." To
   which I will only add that gracious promise of our Saviour; "Blessed
   are the merciful, for they shall find mercy;" and that terrible
   sentence in St. James, "He shall have judgment with out mercy, that
   hath shewed no mercy!"

SERMON CLX.

  OF CONFESSION, AND SORROW FOR SIN.

   I will declare mine iniquity, and be sorry for my sin.--Psalm xxxviii.
   18.

   IN this psalm David does earnestly beg mercy and forgiveness of God,
   and in order to the obtaining of it, he declares both his sins, and his
   repentance for them, in these words, which contain in them two of the
   necessary ingredients, or at least concomitants, of a true repentance;
   viz. confession of sin, and sorrow for it.

   I shall speak something of the first of these, viz. confession of sin:
   but the second, viz. sorrow for sin, shall be the main subject of my
   discourse.

   1. Confession of sin; "I will declare mine iniquity;" or, as it is in
   the old translation, "I will confess my wickedness." Of which I shall
   speak under these three heads:

   I. What confession of sin is.

   II. How far it is necessary.

   III. What are the reasons and grounds of this necessity.

   I. What confession of sin is. It is a declaration or acknowledgment of
   some moral evil or fault to another, which we are conscious to
   ourselves we have been guilty of. And this acknowledgment may be made
   by us, either to God or man. The Scripture mentions both. Confession of
   our sins to God is very frequently mentioned in Scripture, as the first
   and necessary part of repentance; and some times, and in some cases,
   confession to men is no only recommended but enjoined.

   II. How far confession of our sins is necessary That it is necessary to
   confess our sins to God, the Scripture plainly declares, and is I think
   a matter out of all dispute. For it is a necessary part of repentance,
   that we should confess our sins to God with a due sense of the evil of
   them; and, therefore the Scripture maketh this a necessary
   qualification and condition of pardon and forgiveness. (Prov xxviii.
   13.) "Whoso confesseth and forsaketh his sins, shall have mercy." (1
   John i. 9.) "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
   us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness;" implying, that
   if we do not confess our sins to God, the guilt of them will still
   remain; to God, I say, for of confession to him St. John plainly
   speaks, when he says, "He is faithful and just." Who? God surely, who,
   though he be not named before, yet is necessarily understood in the
   words before; "If we confess our sins, (i. e. to God), he is faithful
   and just."

   A general confession of our sins is absolutely necessary; and in some
   cases a particular acknowledgment of them, and repentance for them,
   especially if the sins have been great, and deliberate, and
   presumptuous; in this case a particular confessor of them, and
   repentance for them, is necessary sc far as we can particularly
   recollect them, and cal them to remembrance: whereas, for sins of
   ignorance and infirmity, of surprise and daily incursion, for lesser
   omissions, and the defects and imperfections of our best actions and
   services, we have all the reason that can be to believe, that God will
   accept of a general confession of them, and repentance for them. And if
   any man ask me, where I find this distinction in Scripture between a
   general and particular repentance? I answer, that it is not necessary
   it should be any where expressed in Scripture, being so clearly founded
   in the nature and reason of the thing; because in. many cases it is not
   possible that we should have a particular knowledge and remembrance of
   all our particular sins; as is plain in sins of ignorance, since our
   very calling them by that name does necessarily suppose that we do not
   know them. It is impossible we should remember those sins afterwards
   which we did not know when they were committed; and, therefore, either
   a general repentance for these and the other sins I mentioned of the
   like nature, must be sufficient, in order to the pardon of them; or we
   must say that they are unpardonable, which would be very unreasonable,
   because this would be to make lesser sins more unpardonable than those
   which are far greater.

   And yet, though this difference between a general and particular
   repentance be no where expressly mentioned in Scripture, there does not
   want foundation for it there. (Psal. xix. 12.) "Who can understand his
   errors? Cleanse thou me from secret sins;" i. e. such as we do not
   discern and take notice of when they are committed. And yet David
   supposeth, that upon a general acknowledgment of them, and repentance
   for them, we may be cleansed from them, though we cannot make a
   particular acknowledgment of them, and exercise a particular repentance
   for them, because they are secret, and we do not particularly
   understand what they are.

   As for our confessing our sins to men, both Scripture and reason do, in
   some cases, recommend and enjoin it. As,

   1. In order to the obtaining of the prayers of good men for us: (James
   v. 16.) "Confess your sins one to another;" he said before, "the prayer
   of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up." This,
   in all probability, is meant of the miraculous power of prayer, which
   St. Chrysostom reckons among the miraculous gifts of the Spirit,
   bestowed upon Christians in the first ages of the church: and this is
   very much countenanced and confirmed by what presently follows after
   this command, of confessing our sins one to another, and praying one
   for another, and given as the reason of it; for "the effectual fervent
   prayer of a righteous man availeth much." The original is de'esis
   energoume'en, "the inspired prayer;" which, in the verse before, is
   called "the prayer of faith," meaning that miraculous faith, in the
   power whereof Christians did obtain of God whatever they were inspired
   to ask of him; according to our Saviour's promise in the gospel,
   concerning the efficacy of the prayers of Christians, which we find
   mentioned among the other miraculous powers which were to be conferred
   upon them by the coming of the Holy Ghost.

   2. Confession of our sins to men is likewise reasonable, in order to
   the ease and satisfaction of our minds, and our being directed in our
   duty for the future. In this case, common reason and prudence, without
   any precept of Scripture, will direct men to have recourse to this
   remedy; viz. to discover and lay open our disease to some skilful
   spiritual physician; to some faithful friend, or prudent guide, in
   order to spiritual advice and direction, for the peace and satisfaction
   of our minds. And then,

   3. In case our sins have been public and scandalous, both reason and
   the practice of the Christian church do require, that, when men have
   publicly offended, they should give public satisfaction and open
   testimony of their repentance.

   But as for private and auricular confession of our sins to a priest in
   all cases, and as of absolute necessity to our obtaining pardon and
   forgiveness from God, as the church of Rome teacheth, this is neither
   necessary by Divine precept, nor by any constitution and practice of
   the ancient Christian church, as I have shewn in my former discourse.

   Not to mention the bad consequence of this practice, and the impious
   and dangerous use which hath been made of this seal of confession, for
   the concealing and carrying on of the most wicked and barbarous
   designs, and the debauching of the penitents, by drawing them into the
   commission of the same and greater sins than those which they
   confessed, which the more devout persons of that church have frequently
   complained of:--I proceed now to shew briefly in the

   III. Third place, the grounds and reasons of the necessity of
   confessing our sins to God; and I shall but just mention them.

   1. From the precept and command of God; for which I have already
   produced clear proof of Scripture.

   2. From the nature of the thing, because without this there can be no
   repentance towards God. He that will not so much as own the faults
   which he hath been guilty of, can never repent of them. If we will not
   confess our sins to God, we are never like to be sorry for them.--Thus
   much for the first thing in the text, the confession of our sins. I
   proceed now, to the

   Second ingredient of repentance mentioned in the text, which is sorrow
   for sin; "I will declare mine iniquity, and be sorry for my sin." In
   the handling of this argument, I shall,

   I. Consider the nature of this passion of sorrow.

   II. The reason and grounds of our sorrow for sin.

   III. The measure and degrees of it.

   IV. How far the outward expression of our inward grief by tears is
   necessary to a true repentance.

   I. For the nature of this passion. Sorrow is a trouble or disturbance
   of mind, occasioned by something that is evil, done or suffered by us,
   or which we are in danger of suffering, that tends greatly to our
   damage or mischief: so that to be sorry for a thing, is nothing else
   but to be sensibly affected with the consideration of the evil of it,
   and of the mischief and inconvenience which is like to redound to us
   from it: which if it be a moral evil, such as sin is, to be sorry for
   it, is to be troubled that we have done it, and to wish with all our
   hearts that we had been wiser, and had done other wise; and if this
   sorrow be true and real, if it abide and stay upon us, it will produce
   a firm purpose and resolution in us, not to do the like for the future.

   It is true, indeed, that we are said to be sorry for the death and loss
   of friends; but this is rather the effect of natural affection than of
   our reason, which always endeavours to check and moderate our grief for
   that which we cannot help, and labours by all means to turn our sorrow
   into patience. And we are said, likewise, to grieve for the miseries
   and sufferings of others; but this is not so properly sorrow, as pity
   and compassion. Sorrow rather respects ourselves, and our own doings
   and sufferings. I proceed, in the

   II. Second place, to inquire into the reasons and grounds of our sorrow
   for sin; and they, as I have already hinted, are these two--the
   intrinsical, or the consequent evil of sin; either the evil of sin in
   itself, or the mischiefs and inconveniences which it will bring upon
   us. For every one that is sorry for any fault he is guilty of, he is so
   upon one of these two accounts; either upon the score of ingenuity, or
   of interest; either because he hath done a thing which is unworthy in
   itself, or because he hath done some thing which may prove prejudicial
   to himself; either out of a principle of love and gratitude to God, or
   from a principle of self-love. And though the former of these be the
   better, the more generous principle of sorrow; yet the latter is
   usually the first: because it is the more sensible, and toucheth us
   more nearly. For sin is a base and ill-natured thing, and renders a man
   not so apt to be affected with the injuries he hath offered to God, as
   with the mischief which is likely to fall upon himself. And, therefore,
   I will begin with the latter, because it is usually the more sensible
   cause of our trouble and sorrow for sin.

   1. The great mischief and inconvenience that sin is like to bring upon
   us. When a man is thoroughly convinced of the danger into which his
   sins have brought him, that they have "made him a child of wrath, and a
   son of perdition," that he is thereby fallen under the heavy
   displeasure of Almighty God, and liable to all those dreadful curses
   which are written in his book; that ruin and destruction hang over him,
   and that nothing keeps him from eternal and intolerable torments, but
   the patience and long-suffering of God, which he does not know how soon
   it may cease to interpose between him and the wrath of God, and let him
   fall into that endless and insupportable misery, which is the just
   portion and desert of his sins; he that lays to heart the sad estate
   and condition into which he hath brought himself by sin, and the
   mischiefs which attend him every moment of his continuance in that
   state, and how they are to him, and that there is but a step between
   him and death, and hardly another between that and hell; he cannot
   surely but be very sorry for what he hath done, and be highly
   displeased and offended with himself, that he should be the author of
   his own ruin, and have contributed as much as in him lies to his
   everlasting undoing.

   2. Another and better principle of sorrow for sin, is ingenuity;
   because we are sensible that we have carried ourselves very unworthily
   towards God, and have been injurious to him, who hath laid all possible
   obligations upon us: for he hath made us, and hath given us our beings,
   and hath charged his watchful providence with the continual care of us;
   his bounty hath ministered to the necessities and comforts of our life;
   all the blessings that we enjoy, are the effects of his mere love and
   goodness, without any hope of requital, or expectation of any other
   return from us, than of love, of gratitude, and obedience; which yet
   are of no advantage to him, but very beneficial and comfortable to
   ourselves: for he does not expect duty and obedience from us, with any
   regard of benefit to himself, but for our sakes, and in order to our
   own happiness.

   Nay, his kindness did not stop here, but after we had abused him by our
   repeated provocations, yet he still continued his care of us; and when
   we had farther provoked him to withdraw his love, and to call in his
   abused goodness, and had done what lay in us to make ourselves
   miserable, he would not suffer us to be undone, but found out a ransom
   for us, and hath contrived a way for the pardon of all our offences,
   and to reconcile us to himself, and to restore us to happiness, by the
   most stupendous and amazing condescension of love and goodness that
   ever was, even by giving his only Son to die for us.

   And can we reflect upon all this, and not be sorry and grieved at our
   very hearts, that we should be so evil to him, who hath been so good to
   us; that we should be so undutiful to so loving a father, so unkind to
   so faithful and constant a friend, so ungrateful and unworthy to so
   mighty a benefactor? If any thing will melt us into tears, surely this
   will do it, to consider that we have sinned against him who made us,
   and continually preserves us, and after all our unkindness to him, did
   still retain so great a love for us, as to redeem us from hell and
   destruction by the death and suffering of his Son, and notwithstanding
   all our offences, does still offer us pardon and peace, life and
   happiness? Such considerations as these, seriously laid to heart,
   should, one would think, break the hardest heart, and make tears to
   gush even out of a rock. I proceed, in the

   III. Third place, to consider the measure and degree of our sorrow for
   sin. That it admits of degrees, which ought to bear some proportion to
   the heinousness of our sins, and the several aggravations of them, and
   the time of our continuance in them, is out of all dispute: for though
   the least sin be a just cause of the deepest sorrow, yet, because our
   greatest grief can never bear a due proportion to the vast and infinite
   evil of sin, God is pleased to require and accept such measures of
   sorrow as do not bear an exact correspondence to the malignity of sin,
   provided they be according to the capacity of our nature, and in some
   sort proportioned to the degree and aggravations of our sin: i. e.
   though the highest degree of our sorrow doth necessarily fall below the
   evil of the least sin, yet God requires that we should be more deeply
   affected with some sins than others.

   But what is the lowest degree which God requires in a true penitent,
   and will accept, as it is impossible for me to tell, so it is
   unprofitable for any body to know: for no man can reasonably make this
   inquiry with any other design, than that he may learn how he may come
   off with God upon the cheapest and easiest terms. Now there cannot be a
   worse sign that a man is not truly sensible of the great evil of sin
   than this, that he desires to be troubled for it as little as may be,
   and no longer than needs must: and none surely are more unlikely to
   find acceptance with God, than those who deal so nearly, and endeavour
   to drive so hard a bargain with him.

   And therefore I shall only say this in general, concerning the degrees
   of our sorrow for sin; that sin being so great an evil in itself, and
   of so pernicious a consequence to us, it cannot be too much lamented
   and grieved for by us: and the more and greater our sins have been, and
   the longer we have continued and lived in them, they call for so much
   the greater sorrow, and deeper humiliation from us: for the reasoning
   of our Saviour concerning Mary Magdalen, "She loved much, because much
   was forgiven her," is proportionably true in this case--those who have
   sinned much, should sorrow the more.

   And then we must take this caution along with us, that if we would
   judge aright of the truth of our sorrow for sin, we must not measure it
   so much by the degrees of sensible trouble and affliction, as by the
   rational effects of it, which are hatred of sin, and a fixed purpose
   and resolution against it for the future: for he is most truly sorry
   for his miscarriage, who looks upon what he hath done amiss with
   abhorrence and detestation of the thing, and wisheth he had not done
   it, and censures himself severely for it, and thereupon resolves not to
   do the like again. And this is the character which St. Paul gives of a
   godly sorrow, (2 Cor. vii. 10.) that it "worketh repentance,"
   meta'noian, it produceth a real change in our minds, and makes us to
   alter our purpose and resolution: and though such a person may not be
   so passionately and sensibly afflicted for sin, yet it appears, by the
   effect, that he hath a deeper and more rational resentment of the evil
   of it, than that man who is sad and melancholy, and drooping for never
   so long a time, and after all returns to his former sinful course; the
   degree of his sorrow may appear greater, but the effect of it is really
   less.

   IV. As for the outward expressions of our grief and sorrow. The usual
   sign and outward expression of sorrow is tears; but these being not the
   substance of our duty, but an external testimony of it, which some
   tempers are more unapt to than others; we are much less to judge of the
   truth of our sorrow for sin by these, than by our inward sensible
   trouble and affliction of spirit. Some persons are of a more tender and
   melting disposition, and can command their tears upon a little
   occasion, and upon very short warning; and such persons that can weep
   for every thing else that troubles them, have much more reason to
   suspect the truth of their sorrow for sin, if this outward expression
   of it be wanting. And we find, in Scripture, that the sorrow of true
   penitents does very frequently discover itself by this outward sign of
   it. Thus, when Ezra and the people made confession of their sins to
   God, it is said, that "they wept very sore," (Ezra x.) Peter, when he
   reflected upon that great sin of denying his master, it is said, "he
   went forth and wept bitterly." David also was abundant in this
   expression of his grief. In the Book of Psalms he speaks frequently of
   his sighs and groans, and of watering his couch with his tears: yea, so
   sensibly was he affected with the evil of sin, that he could shed tears
   plentifully for the sins of others: (Psal. cxix. 136.) "Rivers of
   waters run down mine eyes, because men keep not thy law." In like
   manner, Jeremiah tells us, that his soul did weep in secret places, for
   the pride and obstinacy of the Jews; that his "eye did weep sore, and
   run down with tears," (Jer. xiii. 17.) And so likewise St. Paul: (Phil.
   iii. 18.) "There are many that walk, of whom I have told you often, and
   now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies even to the cross of
   Christ." And there seems to be this natural reason for it, that all
   great and permanent impressions upon the mind, all deep inward
   resentments, have usually a proportionable effect upon the body and the
   inferior faculties.

   But though this happen very frequently, yet it is not so constant and
   certain; for all men have not the same tenderness of spirit, nor are
   equally prone to tears: nay, though a man can weep upon natural
   accounts, as upon the loss of a child, or near relation, or an intimate
   friend, or when he lies under a sharp bodily pain, yet a man may truly
   repent, though he cannot express his sorrow for sin the same way,
   provided he give testimony of it by more real effects: and therefore
   the rule, which is commonly given by casuists in this case, seems to be
   more ensnaring than true and useful; namely, "That that man that can
   shed tears upon account of any evil less than that of sin (as certainly
   all natural evils are), ought to question the truth of his repentance
   for any sin that he hath committed, if he can not shed tears for it."
   This I think is not true, because there is scarce any man of so hard
   and unrelenting a spirit, but the loss of a kind father, or a dear
   child, or other near relation, will force tears from him; and yet such
   a man, if it were to save his soul, may not be able at some times to
   shed a tear for his sins. And the reason is obvious; because tears do
   proceed from a sensitive trouble, and are commonly the product of a
   natural affection; and therefore it is no wonder, if they flow more
   readily and easily upon a natural account; because they are the effect
   of a cause suitable to their nature. But sorrow for sin, which hath
   more of the judgment and understanding in it, hath not its foundation
   in natural affection, but in reason; and therefore may not many times
   express itself in tears, though it may produce greater and more proper
   effects.

   So that, upon the whole matter, I see no reason to call in question the
   truth and sincerity of that man's sorrow and repentance, who hates sin
   and forsakes it, and returns to God and his duty, though he can not
   shed tears, and express the bitterness of his soul for his sin, by the
   same significations that a mother doth in the loss of her only son. He
   that cannot weep like a child may resolve like a man, and that
   undoubtedly will find acceptance with God. A learned divine hath well
   illustrated this matter by this similitude: Two persons walking
   together espy a serpent; the one shrieks and cries out at the sight of
   it, the other kills it: so it is in sorrow for sin; some express it by
   great lamentation and tears, and vehement trans ports of passions;
   others by greater and more real effects of hatred and detestation, by
   forsaking their sins, and by mortifying and subduing their lusts: but
   he that kills it does certainly best express his inward displeasure and
   enmity against it.

   The application I shall make of what hath been said upon this argument,
   shall be in two particulars:

   I. By way of caution, and that against a double mistake about sorrow
   for sin.

   1. Some look upon trouble and sorrow for sin as the whole of
   repentance.

   2. Others exact from themselves such a degree of sorrow as ends in
   melancholy, and renders them unfit both for the duties of religion, and
   of their particular calling. The first concerns almost the generality
   of men; the latter but a very few in comparison.

   1. There are a great many who look upon trouble and sorrow for their
   sins as the whole of repentance, whereas it is but an introduction to
   it. It is that which works repentance; but it is not repentance itself.
   Repentance is always accompanied with sorrow for sin; but sorrow for
   sin does not al ways end in true repentance: sorrow only respects sins
   past; but repentance is chiefly preventive of sin for the future. And
   God doth therefore require our sorrow for sin, in order to our
   forsaking of it. (Heb. vi. 1.) Repentance is therefore called
   "repentance from dead works." It is not only a sorrow for them, but a
   turning from them.

   There is no reason why men should be so willing to deceive themselves,
   for (hey are like to be the losers by it: but so we see it is, that
   many men are contented to be deceived to their own ruin; and among many
   other ways which men have to cheat themselves, this is none of the
   least frequent, to think that if they can but shed a few tears for sin
   upon a death-bed, which no doubt they may easily do, when they see
   their friends weeping about them, and apprehend themselves to be in
   imminent danger, not only of death, but of that which is most terrible,
   the heavy displeasure and the fiery indignation of Almighty God, into
   whose hands "it is a fearful thing to fall:" I say, they think that if
   they can but do thus much, God will accept this for true repentance,
   and hereupon grant them pardon and eternal life. And upon these fond
   hopes, they adjourn their repentance, and the reformation of their
   lives, to a dying hour.

   Indeed, if I were to speak to a man upon his death-bed, I would
   encourage him to a great contrition and sorrow for his sins, as his
   last and only remedy, and the best thing he can do at that time; but,
   on the other hand, when I am speaking to those that are well and in
   health, I dare not give them the least encouragement to venture their
   souls upon this, because it is a hazardous and almost desperate remedy;
   especially when men have cunningly and designedly contrived to rob God
   of the service of their lives, and to put him off with a few
   unprofitable sighs and tears at their departure out of the world. Our
   Saviour tells us, that it is "not every one that shall say unto him,
   Lord! Lord! that shall enter into the kingdom of heaven;" and that
   there is a time when "many shall seek to enter in, but shall not be
   able."

   The sum of this caution is, that men should take heed of mistaking
   sorrow for sin for true repentance, unless it be followed with the
   forsaking of sin and the real reformation of our lives. Ahab humbled
   himself, but we do not find that he was a true penitent. Judas was
   sorry for his sin, and yet for all that was "the son of perdition."
   Esau is a sad type of an ineffectual sorrow for sin: (Heb. xii.) where
   the apostle tells us, that "he found no place for repentance," that is,
   no way to change the mind of his father Isaac, "though he sought it
   carefully with tears." If sorrow for sin were repentance, there would
   be store of penitents in hell: for there is the deepest and most
   intense sorrow, "weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth."

   2. Another mistake which men ought to be cautioned against in this
   matter, is, of those who exact from themselves such a degree of sorrow
   for sin, as ends in deep melancholy, as renders them unfit both for the
   duties of religion, and of their particular callings. But because there
   are but very few who fall into this mistake, I shall need to say the
   less to it. This only I shall say, that those who indulge their sorrow
   to such a degree, as to drown their spirits, and to sink them into
   melancholy and mopishness, and thereby render themselves unserviceable
   to God, and unfit for the necessities of this life, they commit one sin
   more to mourn for, and overthrow the end of repentance by the
   indiscreet use of the means of it. For the end of sorrow for sin, is
   the forsaking of it and returning to our duty: but he that sorrows for
   sin, so as to unfit him for his duty, defeats his own design, and
   destroys the end he aims at.

   II. The other part of the application of this discourse should be, to
   stir up this affection of sorrow in us. And here, if I had time, I
   might represent to you the great evil of sin, and the infinite danger
   and inconvenience of it. If the holy men in Scripture, David, and
   Jeremiah, and St. Paul, were so deeply affected with the sins of
   others, as to shed rivers of tears at the remembrance of them; how
   ought we to be touched with the sense of our own sins, who are equally
   concerned in the dishonour brought to God by them, and infinitely more
   in the danger they expose us to! Can we weep for our dead friends; and
   have we no sense of that heavy load of guilt, of that body of death,
   which we carry about with us? Can. we be sad and melancholy for
   temporal losses and sufferings, and "refuse to be comforted;" and is it
   no trouble to us to have lost heaven and happiness, and to be in
   continual danger of the intolerable sufferings and endless torments of
   another world?

   I shall only offer to your consideration, the great benefit and
   advantage which will redound to us from this godly sorrow; "it worketh
   repentance to salvation, not to be repented of," saith St. Paul. If we
   would thus "sow in tears," we should "reap in joy." This sorrow would
   but continue for a time, and in the morning of the resurrection there
   would be joy to all eternity, "Joy unspeakable and full of glory." It
   is but a very little while, and these days of mourning will be
   accomplished; and then "all tears shall be wiped from our eyes; and the
   ransomed of the Lord shall come to Sion with songs, and everlasting joy
   shall be upon their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and
   sorrow and sighing shall flee away. Blessed are they that mourn, for
   they shall be comforted: but woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall
   mourn and weep." If men will rejoice in the pleasures of sin, "and walk
   in the ways of their hearts, and in the sight of their eyes;" if they
   will remove sorrow from their heart, and put away all sad and
   melancholy thoughts from them, and are resolved to harden their spirits
   against the sense of sin, against the checks and convictions of their
   own consciences, and the suggestions of God's Holy Spirit, against all
   the arguments that God can offer, and all the methods that God can use
   to bring them to repentance; let them "know, that for all these things
   God will bring them into judgment;" and, because they would not give
   way to a timely and seasonable sorrow for sin, they shall lie down in
   eternal sorrow; "weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth shall be
   their portion for ever." From which sad and miserable estate, beyond
   all imagination, and past all remedy, God of his infinite goodness
   deliver us all, for Jesus Christ his sake.

SERMON CLXI.

  THE UNPROFITABLENESS OF SIN IN THIS LIFE, AN ARGUMENT FOR REPENTANCE.

   He looketh upon men; and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that
   which was right, and it profited me not; he will deliver his soul from
   going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.--Job xxxiii. 27,
   28.

   THE great folly and perverseness of human nature is in nothing more
   apparent than in this, that when in all other things men are generally
   led and governed by their interests, and can hardly be imposed upon by
   any art, or persuaded by any solicitation, to act plainly contrary to
   it; yet, in matter of their sin and duty, that is, in that which of all
   other is of greatest concernment to them, they have little or no regard
   to it; but are so blinded and bewitched with "the deceitfulness of sin,
   "as not to consider the infinite danger and disadvantage of it; and at
   the same time to cast the commandments of God, and the consideration of
   their own happiness behind their backs.

   And of this every sinner, when he comes to himself, and considers what
   he hath done, is abundantly convinced; as appears by the confession and
   acknowledgment, which is here in the text put into the mouth of a true
   penitent: "I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it
   profited me not,"&c.

   In which words here is a great blessing and benefit promised on God's
   part, and a condition required on our part.

   First, The blessing or benefit promised on God's part, which is
   deliverance from the ill consequences and punishment of sin; "he will
   deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the
   light;" that is, he will deliver him from death and damnation. And
   though, perhaps, temporal death be here immediately intended, yet that
   is a type of our deliverance from eternal death: which is expressly
   promised in the gospel.

   Secondly, Here is the condition required on our part: "If any say, I
   have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me
   not." In which words there are contained,

   I. A penitent confession of our sins to God; for "He looketh upon men,
   and if any say, I have sinned;" that is, make a penitent confession of
   his sin to God.

   II. A true contrition for our sin; not only for fear of the pernicious
   consequences of sin, and the punishment that will follow it, implied in
   these words, "and it profited me not," this is but a very imperfect
   contrition; but from a just sense of the evil nature of sin, and the
   fault and offence of it against God, that we have done contrary to
   right and our duty. "If any say, I have sinned, and perverted that
   which was right. Here you see that true and perfect contrition for our
   sins, is made a necessary condition of the blessing and benefit here
   promised; viz. deliverance from the punishment due to them.

   III. Here is a description of the evil nature of sin, it is a
   perverting of t that which is right. Sin is a perverting of the
   constitution and appointment of God, and of the nature and order of
   things. God hath given man a law and rule to walk by, but "the
   foolishness of man perverteth his way." The great lines of our duty are
   plain and visible to all men; and if we would attend to the direction
   of our own minds, concerning good and evil, every man would be a law to
   himself. "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good." That which is
   right, and just, and good, is plain and obvious, and offers itself
   first to us; and whenever we sin, we go out of the right way that lies
   plain before us, and "turn aside into crooked paths." But when we do
   that which is right, we act agreeably to the design and frame of our
   beings, and comply with the true nature and order of things; we do what
   becomes us, and are what we ought to be: but sin perverts the nature of
   things, and puts them out of course; "I have sinned, and perverted that
   which was right."

   IV. You have here an acknowledgment of the mischievous and pernicious
   consequences of sin: "I have sinned, and perverted that which was
   right, and it profited me not." Which last words are a mei'osis, in
   which much less is said than is meant and intended: "It profited me
   not," that is, it was so far from being of advantage, that the effects
   and consequences of it were very pernicious and destructive.

   And this is not only true as to the final issue and event of an evil
   course in the other world, but I shall endeavour to shew, that even in
   respect of this world, and the present life, the practice of some sins
   is plainly mischievous to the temporal interests of men; that others
   are wholly unprofitable; and that those which pretend to bring some
   benefit and advantage, will, when all accounts are cast up, and all
   circumstances duly weighed and considered, be found to do far
   otherwise.

   First, I shall shew that the practice of some vices is evidently
   mischievous and prejudicial to us, as to this world; as, all those
   vices which fall under the cognizance of human laws, and are punished
   by them, murder, theft, perjury, sedition, rebellion, and the like;
   these cannot be denied to be of pernicious consequence to men, and
   therefore the great patrons of vice seldom plead for these; the
   inconvenience of them is so palpable, that some feel it, and all may
   see it every day.

   But besides these, there are many other sorts of sin which human laws
   either take no notice of, or do not so severely punish, which yet, in
   their natural consequences, are very pernicious to our present
   interest; either they are a disturbance to our minds, or dangerous to
   our health, or ruinous to our estate, or hurtful to our reputation, or
   it may be at once prejudicial to us in all, or most of these respects;
   and these are the greatest temporal inconveniences that men are liable
   to.

   All irregular passions, as wrath, malice, envy, impatience, and
   revenge, are not only a disturbance to ourselves, but they naturally
   draw upon us hatred and contempt from others. Any one of these passions
   is enough to render a man uneasy to himself, and to make his
   conversation disgustful and troublesome to all that are about him; for
   all men naturally hate all those who are of an envious, or malicious,
   or revengeful temper, and are apt to rise up and stand upon their guard
   against them. Anger and impatience are great deformities of the mind,
   and make a man look as ugly as if he had a wry and distorted
   countenance; and these passions are apt to breed in others a secret
   contempt of us, and to bring our prudence into question, because they
   are signs of a weak and impotent mind, that either hath lost, or never
   had, the government of itself.

   There are other vices which are plainly pernicious to oar health, and
   do naturally bring pains and diseases upon men; such are intemperance
   and lust: and though some may pretend to govern themselves in the
   practice of these with so much moderation and discretion, as to prevent
   the notorious bad consequences of them, yet there are very few or none
   that do so: this is seldom more than a speculation, and men that allow
   themselves in any lewd or in temperate course, will find it very hard
   to govern themselves in it; for after men have forfeited their
   innocence, and broke in upon their natural modesty, they are apt by
   degrees to grow profligate and desperate. If a man gives way but little
   to his own vicious inclinations, they will soon get head of him, and no
   man knows how far they will hurry him at last.

   Besides that, the vices I am speaking of, intemperance and lust, have
   other great inconvenience! attending them, they expose men more
   frequently than most other vices, to occasions of quarrel, in which men
   often lose their own lives, or take away other men's, by which they
   fall under the danger of the law, and the stroke of public justice; or,
   if they escape that (as too often they do) they cannot fly from their
   own consciences, which do commonly fill them with the horror and
   torment of such an action all their days; so pernicious are the usual
   consequences of these vices, of which we see sad instances every day.

   Nor are these vices less hurtful to men's estates, for they are
   extremely expensive and wasteful, and usually make men careless of all
   their business and concernments, liable to be cheated by those whom
   they are forced to trust with their affairs, because they will not mind
   them themselves, and be abused by crafty men, who watch the
   opportunities of their folly and weakness, to draw them into foolish
   bargains. It is an old observation, that more men perish by
   intemperance than by the sword; and I believe it is as true, that more
   estates are dissipated and wasted by these two riotous vices, than by
   all other accidents whatsoever.

   And there is scarce any notorious vice, by which men do not greatly
   suffer in their reputation and good name, even when the times are worst
   and most degenerate: any wicked course, whether of debauchery or
   injustice, is a blemish to a man's credit, not only in the esteem of
   the sober and virtuous, but even of those who are loose and
   extravagant; for men are sooner brought to practise what is bad, than
   to approve of it, and do generally think all sin and wickedness to be a
   stain upon them, whatever in a swaggering humour they may say to the
   contrary. A clear evidence of this is, that men do so studiously
   endeavour to conceal their vices, and are so careful that as few as may
   be should be conscious to them, and are so confounded if they be
   discovered, and so out of all patience when they are upbraided with
   them; a plain acknowledgment that these things are shameful in
   themselves, and, whatever face men may put upon things, that they do
   inwardly, and at the bottom of their hearts, believe that these
   practices are deservedly of bad reputation, and do, in the general
   opinion of mankind, leave a blot upon them.

   Secondly, There are other sins, which, though they are not usually
   attended with consequences so palpably mischievous, yet are plainly
   unprofitable, and bring no manner of advantage to men.

   Of this sort is all kind of profaneness, and customary swearing in
   common conversation; there is neither profit nor pleasure in them. What
   doth the profane man get by his contempt of religion? He is neither
   more respected, nor better trusted, for this quality; but, on the
   contrary, it is many times really to his prejudice, and brings a great
   odium upon him, not only from those who sincerely love religion, but
   from others also; though they are conscious to themselves that they do
   not love religion as they ought, yet they have a veneration for it, and
   cannot endure that any one should speak slightly of it.

   And it is as hard to imagine where the pleasure of profaneness lies.
   Men cannot but at first have a great reluctancy in their minds against
   it, and must offer considerable violence to themselves, to bring
   themselves to it; and when it is grown more familiar, and their
   consciences are become more seared and insensible, yet, whenever they
   are alone and serious, or when any affliction or calamity is upon them,
   they are full of fears and anguish, their guilt stares them in the
   face, and their consciences are raging and furious.

   And as all kind of profaneness is unprofitable, so more especially
   customary swearing in ordinary conversation, upon every occasion of
   passion, or any other trivial cause; nay, it may be without cause, out
   of mere habit and custom. Now what can possibly be imagined to be the
   profit or pleasure of this vice? Sensual pleasure in it there can be
   none, because it is not founded in the temper of the body; a man may be
   naturally prone to anger or lust; but no man, I think, is born with a
   swearing constitution.

   And there is as little profit as pleasure in it; for the common and
   trivial use of oaths makes them perfectly insignificant to their end,
   and is so far from giving credit to a man's word, that it rather
   weakens the reputation of it.

   Thirdly, Those vices which pretend to be of advantage to us, when all
   accompts are cast up, and all circumstances duly considered, will be
   found to be quite otherwise. Some vices pretend to bring in profit,
   others to yield pleasure; but upon a thorough examination of the
   matter, these pretences will vanish and come to nothing.

   The vices which pretend to be most profitable are covetousness and
   oppression, fraud and falsehood, and perfidiousness: but if we look
   well into them, we shall find, that either they do not bring the
   advantages they pretend to bring, or that the inconveniences which
   attend them are as great, or greater than the advantages they bring; or
   else that the practice of the opposite virtues would be of much greater
   advantage to us.

   1. Some of these vices do not bring the advantages they pretend to do.
   Covetousness may in crease a man's estate, but it adds nothing to his
   happiness and contentment: for though his estate grow never so much,
   his want is still as great as it was before, and his care and trouble
   continually greater; so that so long as he continues covetous, the more
   rich, the less happy.

   And then, for fraud and falsehood; they are not of that real and
   lasting advantage, that cunning but short-sighted men are apt to
   imagine. Nothing is truer than that of Solomon; "The lying tongue is
   but for a moment." A man can practise the arts of falsehood and deceit
   but for a little while, before they will be discovered; and when they
   are discovered, they are so far from being any advantage to him, that
   they turn to his prejudice, and the cunning man begins to be in a bad
   case, and he that was wont to overreach others, is at last caught
   himself.

   2. Several of these vices are attended with inconveniences as great or
   greater than the advantages they bring. If a man increase his estate by
   injustice and oppression, yet he loseth his reputation. Besides that,
   all fraudulent and unjust courses are apt to entangle a man in a great
   many inconveniences, and to expose him to troublesome suits, for the
   keeping of what he hath unjustly gotten; it is very often seen, that
   what is gotten by injustice is spent in law; and though it may be those
   whom he hath wronged never recover their right, yet first or last the
   unjust man is put to more trouble and vexation about it than the thing
   is worth. This Solomon observes: (Prov. xv. 6.) "In the revenue of the
   wicked there is trouble."

   The perfidious man, by betraying a friend or a trust, may, perhaps,
   make some present advantage: but then, by such villany, he makes
   himself odious to all mankind, and by this means, at one time or other,
   prevents himself of greater advantages which he might have had another
   way; and, perhaps, at last, is miserably crushed by those whom he
   betrayed, who, in the change and revolution of human affairs, may, some
   time or other, have the opportunity of being revenged. Or else,

   3. The practice of the opposite virtues would be of far greater
   advantage to us.

   Truth and fidelity are in common experience found to be a better and
   surer way of thriving, and more like to last and hold out, than fraud
   and false hood; and as honesty is a surer way of raising an estate, so
   it brings along with it greater security of the quiet enjoyment of it.
   There is never any real occasion, and seldom any colour and pretence,
   of bringing such a man into trouble; for which reason Solomon says,
   "Better is the little which the righteous man hath, than great
   possessions without right:" because, though it be but little, yet it
   will wear like steel, and he is like to enjoy it quietly, and may
   increase it; whereas the unjust man is continually in danger of losing
   what he hath gotten.

   And if this be the case, it is very plain, that those vices which
   pretend to bring the greatest advantage, are really unprofitable; and
   to these kind of vices the text seems to point more particularly; "If
   any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which is right, and it
   profited me not," &c.

   But, perhaps, though there be no profit in any sinful course, yet there
   may be some pleasure. That comes next to be examined; and I doubt not
   to make it evident, that there is no such pleasure in sin, as can make
   it a reasonable temptation to any man to venture upon it. The vices
   which pretend to bring the greatest pleasure, are lewdness, and
   intemperance, and revenge.

   The two first of these are the highest pretenders to pleasure: but God
   knows, and the sinner himself knows, how thin and transitory this
   pleasure is, how much trouble attends it, and how many sighs and groans
   follow it; and whatever pleasure they may minister to the sense, they
   bring a great deal of anguish and perplexity to the mind; so that the
   trouble which they cause does more than countervail the pleasure which
   they bring; and they do not only disturb the mind, but they disease the
   body. How many are there, who, for the gratifying of an inordinate
   lust, and for the incomprehensible pleasure of a drunken fit, have
   endured the violent burnings of a fever, or else have consumed the
   remainder of their days in languishing sickness and pain?

   And the reason of all this is plain, because all the pleasures of sin
   are violent, and forced, and unnatural, and therefore not like to
   continue; they are founded in some disease and distemper of our minds,
   and therefore always end in pain and smart.

   And as for revenge, it is indeed a very eager and impatient desire: but
   so far sorely from being a pleasure, that the very thoughts of it are
   extremely troublesome, and raise as great storms in the mind of a man,
   as any passion whatsoever; and I never heard of the pleasure of being
   in a storm; it is pleasant indeed to be out of it, when others are in
   it. And when revenge hath satisfied itself, and laid its enemy bleeding
   at its foot, the man that executed it commonly repents himself the next
   moment, and would give all the world to undo what he hath done; so that
   if there be any pleasure in revenge, it is so flitting, and of so short
   a continuance, that we know not where to fix it; for there is nothing
   but tumult and rage before the execution of it, and after it nothing
   but remorse and horror; so that if it be a pleasure, it is but of one
   moment's continuance, and lasts no longer than the act is a-doing; and
   what man in his wits would purchase so short a pleasure at so dear a
   price? This is most certainly true, and if it were well considered,
   sufficient to convince any reasonable man of the unreasonableness of
   this passion.

   Cain is a fearful instance of this kind, who, after he had drawn his
   brother into the field and slain him there, how was he tormented with
   the guilt of what he had done, and forced to cry out, "My punishment is
   greater than I can bear;" or (as some translations render the words)
   "mine iniquity is greater than that it can be forgiven!" (Gen. iv. 13.)
   "From thy face (says he to God, in the anguish of his soul) shall I be
   hid, and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it
   shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me,"
   (ver. 14.) "Every one that findeth me;" how fearful did his guilt make
   him! when probably there was then but one man in the world besides
   himself. And I may say of this sort of men as St. Jude does of those in
   his time, (Jude 11.) "Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of
   Cain;" they are guilty of his crime, and his doom shall be theirs.

   And here I cannot but take notice of a great evil that grows daily upon
   us, and therefore deserves with the greatest severity to be
   discountenanced and punished: I mean that of duels, than which what can
   be more unchristian? And what can be more unreasonable, than for men,
   upon deliberation, and after the heat of passion is over, to resolve to
   sheath their swords in one another's bowels, only for a hasty word?
   And, which is yet more unreasonable, that because two men are angry,
   and have quarrelled with one another, and will fight it out, that
   therefore two more, who have no quarrel, no kind of displeasure against
   one another, must fight too, and kill one another if they can, for no
   reason, and upon no provocation. These false rules of honour will not
   pass in another world, in the highest and greatest court of honour,
   from whence there is no appeal.

   I shall conclude this whole argument with that excellent saying of
   Cato, reported in A. Gellius: Cogitate cum animis vestris, &c.
   "Consider (says he) with yourselves, if ye be at any trouble and pain
   to do a good action, the trouble will be soon over; but the pleasure
   and comfort of what ye have done well, abides with you all your days;
   but if, to gratify yourselves, you do any thing that is wicked, the
   pleasure will quickly vanish; but the guilt of it will stick by you for
   ever."

   And is it not then much better to prevent all this trouble, by denying
   ourselves these sinful pleasures, which will follow us with guilt
   whilst we live, and fill us with horror and despair when we come to
   die?

   I shall now make some reflections upon what has been delivered, and so
   conclude.

   First, What has been said upon this argument ought particularly to move
   those who have so great a consideration of this present life, and the
   temporal happiness of it, that the practice of all virtues is a friend
   to their temporal, as well as eternal welfare, and all vice is an enemy
   to both.

   Secondly, This likewise takes off all manner of excuse from sin and
   vice. It pretends not to serve the soul, and to profit our future
   happiness in another world; and if it be an enemy also to our present
   welfare in this world, what is there to be said for it?

   Thirdly, (which I desire to insist a little longer upon) all the
   arguments which I have used to convince men of the folly of a wicked
   course, are so many strong and unanswerable reasons for repentance; for
   when a man is convinced that he hath done foolishly, and to his own
   prejudice, that he hath sinned, and that it profited him not, what can
   he do less, than to be heartily sorry for it, and ashamed of it, and
   resolved to do better for the future? Nothing surely is more reasonable
   than repentance; and yet how hard is it to bring men to it? Either men
   will mistake the nature of it, and not do it effectually; or they will
   delay it, and not do it in time.

   I. Men mistake the nature of repentance; and there are two great
   mistakes about it.

   1. Of those who make the great force and virtue of it to consist, not
   so much in the resolution of the penitent, as in the absolution of the
   priest. And this the church of Rome, in their doctrine concerning
   repentance, does. For their sacrament of penance (as they call it) they
   make to consist of two parts: the matter of it, which consists in these
   three acts of the penitent, confession, contrition, and satisfaction;
   and the form of it, which is the absolution of the priest, in which
   they make the main virtue and force of repentance to consist; In qua
   præcipue ipsius vis sita est, are the very words of the council of
   Trent.

   And here is a wide difference betwixt us; for though the comfort of the
   penitent may, in some case, consist in the absolution of the priest,
   yet the virtue and efficacy of repentance does not at all consist in
   it, but wholly in the contrition and sincere resolution of the
   penitent, as the Scripture every where declares: and to think otherwise
   is of dangerous consequence; because it encourageth men to hope for the
   benefit of repentance, that is, the pardon and forgiveness of their
   sins, without having truly repented. And, indeed, the council of Trent
   have so framed their doctrines in this point, that any one may see,
   that they did not matter how much they abated on the part of the
   penitent, provided the power of the priest be but advanced, and kept up
   in its full height.

   2. The other mistake is of those who make repentance to consist in the
   bare resolution of amendment, though it never has its effect; that is,
   though the sinner either do not what he resolved, or do it only for a
   fit, and during his present trouble and conviction.

   There is one case indeed, and but one, wherein a resolution not brought
   to effect is available, and that is, when nothing hinders the
   performance and execution of it, but only want of time and opportunity
   for it, when the repentance is sincere, and the resolution real, but
   the man is cut off between the actual reformation which he intended,
   and which God, who sees things certainly in their causes, knows would
   have followed, if the man had lived to give demonstration of it. But
   this is nothing to those who have the opportunity to make good their
   resolution, and do not; for, because the resolution which would have
   been performed, had there been time and opportunity, is reckoned for a
   true repentance, and accepted of God, as if it had been done; therefore
   the resolution which was not brought to effect when there was time and
   opportunity for it, hath not the nature of true repentance, nor will it
   be accepted of God.

   I will add but one thing more upon this head, because I doubt it is not
   always sufficiently considered; and that is this, that a sincere
   resolution of a better course, does imply a resolution of the means, as
   well as of the end: he that is truly resolved against any sin, is
   likewise resolved against the occasions and temptations that would lead
   and draw him to it; otherwise he hath taken up a rash and foolish
   resolution, which he is not like to keep, because he did not resolve
   upon that which was necessary to the keeping of it. So he that resolves
   upon any part of his duty, must likewise resolve upon the means which
   are necessary to the discharge and performance of it; he that is
   resolved to be just in his dealing, and to pay his debts, must be
   diligent in his calling, and mind his business; because without this he
   cannot do the other; for nothing can be more vain and fond, than for a
   man to pretend that he is resolved upon doing his duty, when he
   neglects any thing that is necessary to put him into a capacity, and to
   further him in the discharge of it. This is as if a man should resolve
   to be well, and yet never take physic, or be careless in observing the
   rules which are prescribed in order to his health. So, for a man to
   resolve against drunkenness, and yet to run himself upon the
   temptations which naturally lead to it, by frequenting the company of
   lewd and intemperate persons, this is as if a man should resolve
   against the plague, and run into the pest-house. Whatever can
   reasonably move a man to be resolved upon any end, will, if his
   resolution be wise and honest, determine him as strongly to use the
   means which are proper and necessary to that end.

   These are the common mistakes about this mat ter, which men are the
   more willing to run into, because they are loath to be brought to a
   true repentance, the nature whereof is not difficult to be understood
   (for nothing in the world is plainer), only men are always slow to
   understand what they have no mind to put in practice. But,

   II. Besides these mistakes about repentance, there is another great
   miscarriage in this matter, and that is, the delay of repentance; men
   are loath to set about it, and therefore they put it upon the last
   hazard, and resolve then to huddle it up as well as they can; but this
   certainly is great folly, to be still making more work for repentance,
   because it is to create so much needless trouble and vexation to
   ourselves: it is to go on still in playing a foolish part, in hopes to
   retrieve all by an after game; this is extremely dangerous, because we
   may certainly sin, but it is not certain we shall repent; our
   repentance may be prevented, and we may be cut off in our sins; but if
   we should have space for it, repentance may, in process of time, grow a
   hundred times more difficult than it is at present.

   But if it were much more certain and more easy than it is, if it were
   nothing but a hearty sorrow and shame for our sins, and an asking God
   forgiveness for them, without being put to the trouble of reforming our
   wicked lives, yet this were great folly, to do those things which will
   certainly grieve us after we have done them, and put us to shame, and
   to ask forgiveness for them. It was well said of old Cato, Næ tu
   stultus es homuncio, qui malis veniam precari, quam non peccare; "Thou
   art a foolish man indeed, who choosest rather to ask forgiveness than
   not to offend."

   At the best, repentance implies a fault; it is an after-wisdom, which
   supposeth a man first to have played the fool; it is but the best end
   of a bad business; a hard shift, and a desperate hazard, which a man
   that had acted prudently would never have been put to; it is a plaster
   after we have dangerously wounded ourselves: but certainly it had been
   much wiser to have prevented the danger of the wound, and the pain of
   curing it. A wise man would not make himself sick if he could; or if he
   were already so, would not make himself sicker, though he had the most
   effectual and infallible remedy in the world in his power: but this is
   not the case of a sinner, for repentance as well as faith is the gift
   of God.

   Above all, let me caution you not to put off this great and necessary
   work to the most unseasonable time of all other, the time of sickness
   and death, upon a fond presumption, that you can be reconciled to God
   when you please, and exercise such a repentance as will make your peace
   with him at any time.

   I am heartily afraid that a very great part of mankind do miscarry upon
   this confidence, and are swallowed up in the gulf of eternal perdition
   with this plank in their arms. The common custom is (and I fear it is
   too common), when the physician has given over his patient, then, and
   not till then, to send for the minister; not so much to inquire into
   the man's condition, and to give him suitable advice, as to minister
   comfort, and to speak peace to him at a venture.

   But let me tell you, that herein you put an extreme difficult task upon
   us, in expecting that we should pour wine and oil into the wound before
   it be searched, and speak smooth and comfortable things to a man that
   is but just brought to a sense of the long course of a lewd and wicked
   life impenitently continued in. Alas! what comfort can we give to men
   in such a case? We are loath to drive them to despair, and yet we must
   not destroy them by presumption; pity and good-nature do strongly tempt
   us to make the best of their case, and to give them all the little
   hopes which with any kind of reason we can, and God knows it is but
   very little that we can give to such persons, upon good ground; for it
   all depends upon the degree and sincerity of their repentance, which
   God only knows, and we can but guess at. We can easily tell them what
   they ought to have done, and what they should do if they were to live
   longer, and what is the best that they can do in those straits into
   which they have brought themselves; viz. to exercise as deep a sorrow
   and repentance for their sins as is possible, and "to cry mightily to
   God" for mercy, in and through the merit of our blessed Saviour. But
   how far this will be available in these circumstances we cannot tell;
   because we do not know whether, if the man had lived longer, this
   repentance and these resolutions, which he now declares of a better
   course, would have been good.

   And after all is done that can be done in so short a time, and in such
   circumstances of confusion and disorder as commonly attend dying
   persons, I doubt the result of all will be this: that there is much
   more ground of fear than hope concerning them; nay, perhaps, while we
   are pressing the dying sinner to repentance, and he is bungling about
   it, he expires, in great doubt and perplexity of mind, what will become
   of him! or, if his eyes be closed with more comfortable hopes of his
   condition, the next time he opens them again he may find his fearful
   mistake, like the rich man in the parable, who, when he was in hell,
   "lifted up his eyes, being in torment!"

   This is a very dismal and melancholy consideration, and commands all
   men presently to repent, and not to put off the main work of their
   lives to the end of them, and the time of sickness and old age. Let us
   not offer up a carcass to God instead of a living and acceptable
   sacrifice: but let us turn to God in the days of our health and
   strength, "before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, of which
   we shall say we have no pleasure in them; before the sun, and the moon,
   and the stars be darkened," as Solomon elegantly expresseth it,
   (Eccles. xii. 1, 2.) before all the comforts of life be gone, before
   our faculties be all ceased and spent, before our understandings be too
   weak, and our wills too strong; our understandings be too weak for
   consideration and the deliberate exercise of repentance, and our wills
   too strong and stiff to be bent and bowed to it.

   Let us not deceive ourselves; heaven is not a hospital made to receive
   all sick and aged persons that can but put up a faint request to be
   admitted there; no, no, they are never like to "see the kingdom of
   God," who, instead of "seeking it in the first place," make it their
   "last refuge and retreat;" and when they find the sentence of death
   upon them, only to avoid present execution, do bethink themselves of
   getting to heaven, and, since there is no other remedy, are contented
   to petition the great King and Judge of the world, that they may be
   transported thither.

   Upon all these considerations, let us use no delay in a matter of such
   mighty consequence to our eternal happiness, but let the counsel which
   was given to Nebuchadnezzar be acceptable to us; let us "break oft our
   sins by righteousness, and our iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor;
   if so be it may be a lengthening of our tranquillity." Repentance and
   alms do well together; let us "break off our sins by righteousness, and
   our iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor;" especially upon this
   great occasion, which his Majesty's great goodness to those distressed
   strangers, that have taken sanctuary among us, hath lately presented us
   withal, "remembering that we also are in the body," and liable to the
   like sufferings; and considering, on the one hand, that gracious
   promise of our Lord, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive
   mercy;" and, on the other hand, that terrible threatening in St. James,
   "He shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy."

   To conclude, from all that hath been said, let us take up a present
   resolution of a better course, and enter immediately upon it, "to-day,
   whilst it is called to-day, lest any of you be hardened through the
   deceitfulness of sin. O that men were wise, that they understood this,
   that they would consider their latter end!--And grant, we beseech thee,
   Al mighty God, that we may all know and do, in this our day, the things
   which belong to our peace, for thy mercy's sake in Jesus Christ; to
   whom, with thee, O Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory,
   now and for ever. Amen."

SERMON CLXII.

  THE SHAMEFULNESS OF SIN, AN ARGUMENT FOR REPENTANCE.

   What fruit had ye then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? For
   the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and
   become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end
   everlasting life.--Rom. vi. 21, 22.

   THERE are two passions which do always, in some degree or other,
   accompany a true repentance; viz. sorrow and shame for our sins;
   because these are necessary to engage men to a resolution of making
   that change wherein repentance does consist: for till we are heartily
   sorry for what we have done, and ashamed of the evil of it, it is not
   likely that we should ever come to a firm and steady purpose of
   forsaking our evil ways, and betaking ourselves to a better course.

   And these two passions, of sorrow and shame for our sins, were wont
   anciently to be signified by those outward expressions of humiliation
   and repentance, which we find so frequently mentioned in Scripture, of
   being clothed in sackcloth, as a testimony of our sorrow and mourning
   for our sins, and of" being sprinkled upon the head, and covered over
   with filth and dirt, and dust and ashes," in token of our shame and
   confusion of face for all our iniquities and transgressions. Hence are
   those expressions in Scripture of repenting in sackcloth and ashes, of
   lying down in our shame, and being covered with confusion, in token of
   their great sorrow and shame for the manifold and heinous sins which
   they have been guilty of.

   Of the former of these, viz. trouble and sorrow for our sins, I have
   very lately treated; [2] and of the latter, I intend now, by God's
   assistance, to speak, viz. shame for our sins, and that from these
   words which I have recited to you: "What fruit had ye then in those
   things?" &c. In which words the apostle makes a comparison between a
   holy and virtuous, and a sinful and vicious, course of life, and sets
   before us a perfect enumeration of the manifest inconveniences of the
   one, and the manifold advantages of the other.

   First, The manifest inconveniences of a vicious and sinful course; and
   the apostle mentions these three:

   I. It is unprofitable, it brings no manner of present benefit and
   advantage to us, if all things be rightly calculated and considered.
   "What fruit had ye then in those things?" "Then," (i. e.) at the time
   when you committed those sins, had you any present advantage by them?
   No, certainly; but quite contrary.

   II. The reflection upon our sins afterwards is cause of shame and
   confusion to us; "What fruit had ye then in those things, whereof ye
   are now ashamed?"

   III. The final issue and consequence of these things is very dismal and
   miserable; "The end of those things is death." Let us put these things
   together, and see what they amount to.--No fruit then when ye did these
   things, and shame now when ye come afterwards to reflect upon them, and
   death and misery at the last.

   Secondly, Here is likewise, on the other hand, represented to us the
   manifold benefits of a holy and virtuous life. And that upon these two
   accounts:

   I. Of the present benefit of it, which the apostle calls here fruit:
   "Ye have your fruit unto holiness."

   II. In respect of the future reward of it: "And the end everlasting
   life." Here is a considerable earnest in hand, and a mighty recompence
   after wards, infinitely beyond the proportion of our best actions and
   services, both in respect of the greatness and the duration of it,
   "everlasting life;" for a few transient and very imperfect actions of
   obedience, a perfect, and immutable, and endless state of happiness. I
   shall begin with the

   First of the two general heads; viz. The manifest inconveniences of a
   sinful and vicious course; and the apostle, I told you in the text,
   takes notice of three:

   I. It is unprofitable, and if all things be rightly calculated and
   considered, it brings no manner of present advantage and benefit to us.
   "What fruit had ye then in those things?" "Then," (i. e.) when ye
   committed those sins, had you any present advantage by them? No,
   certainly, quite the contrary; as if the apostle had said, If you
   seriously reflect upon your former course of impiety and sin, wherein
   you have continued so long, you cannot but acknowledge that it brought
   no manner of advantage to you; and when all accounts are truly cast up,
   you must, if you will confess the truth, own, that you were in no sort
   gainers by it: for the words are a mei'osisand the apostle plainly
   intends more than he expresseth, "What fruit had ye then in those
   things?" (i. e.) The wicked course which ye formerly lived in was so
   far from being any ways beneficial to you, that it was, on the
   contrary, upon all accounts extremely to your prejudice and
   disadvantage.

   And this is not only true in respect of the final issue and consequence
   of a sinful and vicious course of life, that no man is a gainer by it
   at the long run; and if we take into our consideration another world,
   and the dreadful and endless misery which a wicked and impenitent life
   will then plunge men into (which, in the farther handling of this text,
   will at large be spoken to, being the last of the three particulars
   under this first general head); but it is true likewise, even in
   respect of this world, and with regard only to this present and
   temporal life, without looking so far as the future recompence and
   punishment of sin in another world.

   And this would plainly appear, by an induction of these three
   particulars:

   1, It is evident that some sins are plainly mischievous to the temporal
   interest of men, as tending, either to the disturbance of their minds,
   or the endangering of their health and lives, or to the prejudice of
   their estates, or the blasting of them in their reputation and good
   name.

   2. That there are other sins, which, though they rare not so visibly
   burdened and attended with mischievous consequences, yet they are
   plainly unprofitable, and bring no manner of real advantage to men,
   either in respect of gain or pleasure; such are the sins of profaneness
   and customary swearing in common conversation.

   3. That even those sins and vices which make the fairest pretence to be
   of advantage to us, when all accounts are cast up, and all
   circumstances duly weighed and considered, will be found to be but
   pretenders, and in no degree able to perform and make good what they so
   largely promise before hand, when they tempt us to the commission of
   them. There are some vices which pretend to bring in great profit, and
   tempt worldly-minded men, whose minds are disposed to catch at that
   bait; such are the sins of covetousness and oppression, of fraud, and
   falsehood, and perfidiousness. And there are others which pretend to
   bring pleasure along with them, which is almost an irresistible
   temptation to voluptuous and sensual men; such are the sins of revenge,
   and intemperance, and lust. But, upon a particular examination of each
   of these, it will evidently appear, that there is no such profit or
   pleasure in any of these vices as can be a reason able temptation to
   any man to fall in love with them, and to engage in the commission and
   practice of them. But I shall not now enlarge upon any of these, having
   lately discoursed upon them from another text. I shall therefore
   proceed to the

   II. Second inconvenience which I mentioned of a sinful and vicious
   course; viz. that the reflection upon our sins afterwards, is cause of
   great shame and confusion to us. "What fruit had you then in those
   things, whereof ye are now ashamed?" And this is a very proper argument
   for this season; [3] because the passion of shame, as it is a natural
   and useful consequent of sin, so it is a disposition necessarily
   required to a true repentance.

   Most men when they commit a known fault are apt to be ashamed, and
   ready to blush whenever they are put in mind of it, and charged with
   it. Some persons, indeed, have gone so far in sin, and have waded so
   deep in a vicious course, as to be confirmed and hardened in their
   wickedness to that degree, as to be past all shame, and almost all
   sense of their faults; especially in regard of the more common and
   ordinary vices, which are in vogue and fashion; and in the commission
   whereof they are countenanced and encouraged by company and example.
   Such were those of whom the prophet speaks, (Jer. vi. 15.) "Were they
   ashamed, when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not
   ashamed, neither could they blush."

   But yet even these persons, when they come to be sensible of their
   guilt, so as to be brought to repentance, they cannot then but be
   ashamed of what they have done. For what face soever men may set upon
   their vices, sin is shameful in itself, and so apt to fill men with
   confusion of face, when they seriously reflect upon it, that they
   cannot harden their foreheads against all sense of shame. And whatever
   men may declare to the contrary, this is tacitly acknowledged by the
   generality of men, in that they are so solicitous and careful to
   conceal their faults from the eyes of others, and to keep them as
   secret as they can; and whenever they are discovered and laid open, it
   is matter of great trouble and confusion to them, and if any one happen
   to upbraid and twit them with their miscarriages of any kind, they
   cannot bear with patience to hear of them.

   There are, indeed, some few such prodigies and monsters of men, as are
   able, after great strugglings with their consciences, to force
   themselves to boast impudently of their wickedness, and "to glory in
   their shame;" not because they do really and inwardly believe their
   vices to be a honour and glory to them; but because, conscious to
   themselves that they have done shameful things, and believing that
   others know it, they put on a whore's forehead, and think to prevent
   the upbraiding of others, by owning what they have done, and seeming to
   glory in it: but yet for all that, these persons, if they would confess
   the truth, do feel some confusion in themselves, and they are inwardly
   sensible of the infamy and reproach of such actions, for all they would
   seem to the world to bear it out so well: for when all is done, there
   is a wide difference between the impudence of a criminal, and the
   confidence and assurance of a clear conscience, that is fully satisfied
   of its own innocence and integrity. The conscientious man is not
   ashamed of any thing that he hath done: but the impudent sinner only
   seems not to be so, but all the while feels a great deal of confusion
   in his own mind. The one is sensible and satisfied that there is no
   cause for shame; the other is conscious to himself that there is cause,
   but he offers violence to himself, and suppresses all he can the sense
   and show of it, and will needs face down the world, that he hath no
   guilt and regret in his own mind for any thing that he hath done.

   Now that sin is truly matter of shame, will be very evident, if we
   consider these two things:

   First, If we consider the nature of this passion of shame.

   Secondly, If we consider what there is in sin which gives real ground
   and occasion for it.

   First, For the nature of this passion. Shame is the trouble or
   confusion of mind, occasioned by something that tends to our disgrace
   and dishonour, to our infamy and reproach. Now there is nothing truly
   and really matter of shame and reproach to us, but what we ourselves
   have done, or have been some way or other accessary to the doing of, by
   our own fault or neglect, and by consequence what it was in our power
   and choice not to have done: for no man is ashamed of what he is sure
   he could not help. Necessity, unless it be wilful and contracted, and
   happens through some precedent occasion and fault of our own, does take
   away all just cause of shame.

   And nothing likewise is matter of shame, but something which we ought
   not to do, which misbecomes us, and is below the dignity and perfection
   of our nature, and is against some duty and obligation that is upon us
   to the contrary; and, consequently, is a reproach to our reason and
   under standing, a reflection upon our prudence and discretion, and at
   first sight hath an appearance of ruggedness and deformity.

   And all actions of this nature do receive several aggravations with
   respect to the persons against whom, and in whose presence, and under
   whose eye and knowledge, these shameful things are done. Now I shall
   shew, in the

   Second place, that sin contains in it whatsoever is justly accounted
   infamous, together with all the aggravations of shame and reproach that
   can be imagined. And this will appear by considering sin and vice in
   these two respects:

   I. In relation to ourselves.

   II. In respect to God, against whom, and in whose sight, it is
   committed.

   I. In relation to ourselves, there are these four things which make sin
   and vice to be very shameful:

   1. The natural ruggedness and deformity of it.

   2. That it is so great a dishonour to our nature, and to the dignity
   and excellency of our being.

   3. That it is so great a reproach to our reason and understanding, and
   so foul a reflection upon our prudence and discretion.

   4. That it is our own voluntary act and choice.

   Every one of these considerations render it very shameful, and all of
   them together ought to fill the sinner with confusion of face. I shall
   speak to them severally.

   1. The natural ruggedness and deformity of sin and vice render it very
   shameful. Men are apt to be ashamed of any thing in them, or belonging
   to them, that looks ugly and monstrous, and therefore they endeavour
   with great care and art to conceal and dissemble their deformity in any
   kind. How strangely do we see men concerned, with all their diligence
   and skill, to cover and palliate any defect or deformity in their
   bodies; an ill face, if they could; however, a foul and bad complexion,
   or a blind squinting eye, a crooked body, or limb, or whatever is
   ill-favoured or monstrous. Now, in regard of our souls and better part,
   sin hath all the monstrousness and deformity in it which we can imagine
   in the body, and much more: and it is as hard to be covered from the
   eye of discerning men, as the deformity of the body is; but impossible
   to be concealed from the eye of God, to whom darkness and light, secret
   and open, are all one. But then the moral defects and deformities of
   the mind have this advantage above the natural defects and deformities
   of the body, that the former are possible to be cured by the grace of
   God, in conjunction with our own care and endeavour; where as no
   diligence or skill can ever help or remove many of the natural defects
   and deformities of the body.

   Sin is the blindness of our minds, the perverseness and crookedness of
   our wills, and the monstrous irregularity and disorder of our
   affections and appetites; it is the misplacing of our powers and
   faculties, the setting of our wills and passions above our reason; all
   which is ugly and unnatural; and if we were truly sensible of it,
   matter of great shame and reproach to us.

   There is hardly any vice but at first sight hath an odious and ugly
   appearance to a well-disciplined and innocent mind, that hath never had
   any acquaintance with it. And however familiarity and custom may abate
   the sense of its deformity, yet it is as it was before, and the change
   that is made in us does not alter the nature of the thing. Drunkenness
   and furious passion, pride and falsehood, covetousness and cruelty, are
   odious, and matter of shame, in the sincere and uncorrupted opinion of
   all mankind. And though a man, by the frequent practice of any of these
   vices, and a long familiarity with them, may not be so sensible of the
   deformity of them in himself, yet he quickly discerns the ugliness of
   them in others, whenever they come in his way, and could with salt and
   sharpness enough upbraid those whom he sees guilty of them, but that he
   is inwardly conscious, that the reproach may be so easily returned and
   thrown back upon himself. However, this is a natural acknowledgment of
   the deformity and shamefulness of sin and vice.

   2. They are likewise shameful, because they are so great a dishonour to
   our nature, and to the dignity and excellency of our being. We go below
   ourselves, and act beneath the dignity of our nature, when we do any
   thing contrary to the rules and laws of it, or to the revealed will of
   God; because these are the bounds and limits which God and nature hath
   set to human actions; and are the measures of our duty; i. e. what is
   fit and becoming for us to do, and what not. So that all sin and vice
   is base and unworthy, and beneath the dignity of our nature; it argues
   a corrupt and diseased constitution and habit of mind, a crooked and
   perverse disposition of will, and a sordid and mean temper of spirit.

   And therefore the Scripture doth frequently represent a state of sin
   and wickedness, by that which is accounted the basest and meanest
   condition among men, by a state of servitude and slavery, especially if
   it had been our choice, or the evident and necessary consequence of our
   wilful fault: for we do as bad as choose it, when we wilfully bring it
   upon ourselves. So that to be a sinner, is to be a slave to some vile
   lust, appetite, or passion, to some unnatural or irregular desire; it
   is to sell ourselves into bondage, and to part with one of the most
   valuable things in the world, our liberty, upon low and unworthy terms.
   Such a state and condition does unavoidably debase and debauch our
   minds, and break the force and firmness of our spirits, and robs us, as
   Delilah did Sampson, of our strength and courage, of our resolution and
   constancy; so that men have not the heart left to design and endeavour
   in good earnest their own rescue out of this mean and miserable estate,
   into which, by their own folly and fault, they have brought themselves.

   When men are engaged into a custom of sinning, and have habituated
   themselves to any vicious course, how do they betray their weakness,
   and want of resolution, by being at the beck of every foolish lust, and
   by suffering themselves to be commanded and hurried away by every
   unruly appetite and passion, to do things which they know to be greatly
   to their harm and prejudice, and which they are convinced are mean and
   sordid things, and such as they are ashamed that any wise man should
   see them doing! And there is no greater argument of a pitiful and
   degenerate spirit, than to commit such things as a man would blush to
   be surprised in, and would be mightily troubled to hear of afterwards.
   And, which is more, after he hath been convinced by manifold
   experience, that they are a shame and disgrace to him, and make him
   hang down his head, and let fall his countenance, whenever he is in
   better company than himself; yet after this to go and do the same
   things again, which he is sensible are so shameful, and to be so
   impotent, and to have so little command of himself, as not to be able
   to free himself from this bondage, nor the heart to pray to God that by
   his grace he would enable him hereto.

   And that sin is of this shameful nature is evident, in that the
   greatest part of sinners take so much care and pains to hide their
   vices from the sight and notice of men, and to this purpose choose
   darkness and secret places of retirement to commit their sins in. The
   apostle takes notice, that thus much modesty was left, even in a very
   wicked and degenerate age: (1 Thess. v. 7.) "They that be drunk (says
   he) are drunk in the night." Now all this is a plain acknowledgment,
   that sin is a spurious and degenerate thing, that it misbecomes human
   nature, and is below the dignity of a reasonable creature: other wise,
   why should men be so solicitous and concerned to cover their faults
   from the sight of others? if they are not ashamed of them, why do they
   not bring them into the broad light, and shew them openly, if they
   think they will endure it?

   So true is that observation which Plato makes--That though a man were
   sure that God would forgive his sins, and that men should never know
   them, yet there is that baseness in sin, that a wise man, that
   considers what it is, would blush to himself alone to be guilty of it;
   and though he were not afraid of the punishment, would be ashamed of
   the turpitude and deformity of it.

   Did but a man consider seriously with himself, how mean and unmanly it
   is for a man to be drunk; and what an apish and ridiculous thing he
   renders himself to all sober men that behold him, and with what
   contempt and scorn they entertain such a sight; and how brutish it is
   to wallow in any unlawful lust, and how much a man descends and stoops
   beneath himself: what shameful fear and cowardice he betrays when he is
   frighted to tell a lie out of fear, or tempted thereto for some little
   advantage; and yet is so inconsistent with himself, as to have, or to
   pretend to have, the courage to fight any man that shall tell him so
   saucy a truth, as that he told a lie.

   Would but a man think beforehand, how unworthy and how unequal a thing
   it is to defraud or cheat his brother, or to do any thing to another
   man which he would be loath, in the like case, that he should do to
   him; how base a thing it is for a man to be perfidious and false to his
   promise or trust; how monstrous to be unthankful to one that hath
   highly obliged him, and every way and upon all occasions deserved well
   at his hands; and so I might instance in all other sorts of sins: I
   say, he that considers this well and wisely, though there were no law
   against sin, and (if it were a possible case, and fit to be supposed)
   though there were no such being as God in the world, to call him to
   account and punish him for it, yet, out of mere generosity and
   greatness of mind, out of pure respect to himself, and the dignity and
   rank of his being, and of his order in the world, out of very reverence
   to human nature, and the inward persuasion of his own mind (however he
   came by that persuasion) concerning the indecency, and deformity, and
   shamefulness of the thing; I say, for these reasons, if there were no
   other, a man would strive with himself, with all his might, to refrain
   from sin and vice, and not only blush, but abhor to think of doing a
   wicked action.

   3. Sin will yet farther appear shameful, in that it is so great a
   reproach to our understandings and reasons, and so foul a blot upon our
   prudence and discretion. Omnis peccans aut ignorans est, aut
   incogitans, is a saying, I think, of one of the schoolmen (as one would
   guess by the Latin of it); "Every sinner is either an ignorant or an
   inconsiderate person." Either men do not understand what they do, when
   they commit sin; or if they do know, they do not actually attend to and
   consider what they know. Either they are habitually or actually
   ignorant of what they do; for sin and consideration cannot dwell
   together; it is so very unreasonable and absurd a thing, that it
   requires either gross ignorance, or stupid inadvertency, to make a man
   capable of committing it. Whenever a man sins, he must either be
   destitute of reason, or must lay it aside or asleep for the time, and
   so suffer himself to be hurried away, and to act brutishly, as if he
   had no understanding.

   Did but men attentively consider what it is to offend God, and to break
   the laws of that great Law giver, who "is able to save or to destroy,"
   they would discern so many invincible objections against the thing, and
   would be filled with such strong fears and jealousies of the fatal
   issue and event of it, that they would not dare to venture upon it. And
   therefore we find the Scripture so frequently resolving the wickedness
   of men into their ignorance and inconsiderateness. (Psal. xiv. 4.)
   "Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?" Intimating that by
   their actions one would judge so. And the same account God himself also
   gives elsewhere of the frequent disobedience and rebellion of the
   people of Israel: (Pent, xxxii. 28, 29.) "They are a nation void of
   counsel, neither is there any understanding in them. O! that they were
   wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter
   end!" Knowledge and consideration would cure a great part of the
   wickedness that is in the world; men would not commit sin with so much
   greediness would they but take time to consider and bethink themselves
   what they do.

   Have we not reason then to be ashamed of sin, which casts such a
   reproach of ignorance and rashness upon us? and of imprudence,
   likewise, and in discretion? since nothing can be more directly and
   plainly against our greatest and best interest, both of body and soul,
   both here and hereafter, both now and to all eternity. And there is
   nothing that men are more ashamed of, than to be guilty of so great a
   imprudence, as to act clearly against their own interest, to which sin
   is the most plainly cross and contrary that it is possible for any
   thing to be. No man can engage and continue in a sinful course, without
   being so far abused and infatuated, as to be contented to part with
   everlasting happiness, and to be undone and miserable for ever; none
   but he that can persuade himself against all the reason and sense of
   mankind, that there is pleasure enough in the transient acts of sin to
   make amends for eternal sorrow, and shame, and suffering. And can such
   a thought as this enter into the heart of a considerate man? Epicurus
   was so wise, as to conclude against all pleasures that would give a man
   more trouble and disturbance afterwards; against all pleasures that had
   pain and grief consequent upon them; and he forbids his wise man to
   taste of them, or to meddle with them; and had he believed any thing of
   a future state, he must, according to his principle, have pronounced it
   the greatest folly that could be, for any man to purchase the pleasures
   and happiness of a few years, at the dear rate of eternal misery and
   torment. So that, if it be a disgrace to a man to act imprudently, and
   to do things plainly against his interest, then vice is the greatest
   reproach that is possible.

   The 4th and last consideration, which renders sin so shameful to us,
   is, that it is our own voluntary act and choice. We choose this
   disgrace, and willingly bring this reproach upon ourselves. We pity an
   idiot, and one that is naturally destitute of under standing, or one
   that loseth the use of his reason by a disease or other inevitable
   accident: but every one despiseth him who besots himself, and plays the
   fool out of carelessness and a gross neglect of himself. And this is
   the case of a sinner; there is no man that sinneth, but because he is
   wanting to himself; he might be wiser and do better, and will not; but
   he chooses his own devices, and voluntarily runs himself upon those
   inconveniencies, which it was in his power to have avoided.

   Not but that I do heartily own and lament the great corruption and
   degeneracy of our nature, an j the strong propensions which appear so
   early in us to that which is evil; but God hath provided a remedy and
   cure for all this: for since "the grace of God which brings salvation
   unto all men hath appeared," under the influence and through the
   assistance of that grace which is offered to them by the gospel, men
   may "deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and live soberly, righteously,
   and godly, in this present world." For I make no doubt, but since God
   has entered into a new covenant of grace with mankind, and offered new
   terms of life and salvation to us; I say, I doubt not but his grace is
   ready at hand, to enable us to perform all those conditions which he
   requires of us, if we be not wanting to ourselves.

   There was a way of salvation established, before the gospel was clearly
   revealed to the world; and they who, under that dispensation, whether
   Jews or gentiles, sincerely endeavoured to do the will of God, so far
   as they knew it, were not utterly destitute of Divine grace and
   assistance: but now there is a more plentiful effusion of God's grace
   and Holy Spirit; so that whoever under the gospel sins deliberately,
   sins wilfully, and is wicked, not for want of power but of will to do
   otherwise. And this is that which makes sin so shameful a thing, and so
   very reproachful to us, that we destroy ourselves by our own folly and
   neglect of ourselves, and become miserable by our own choice, and when
   the grace of God hath put it in our power to be wise and to be happy.

   I should now have proceeded to the second thing I proposed, which was
   to consider sin in relation to God, and to shew that it is no less
   shameful in that respect, than I have shewn it to be with regard to
   ourselves; but this I shall refer to another opportunity.

SERMON CLXIII.

  THE SHAMEFULNESS OF SIN, AN ARGUMENT FOR REPENTANCE.

   What fruit had ye then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? For
   the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and
   become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end
   everlasting life.--Rom. vi. 21, 22.

   IN these words the apostle makes a comparison between a holy and
   virtuous, and a sinful and vicious course of life, and sets before us a
   perfect enumeration of the manifest inconveniencies of the one, and the
   manifold advantages of the other.

   I began with the first of these; viz. to shew the manifest
   inconveniencies of a sinful and vicious course. I am upon the second
   inconvenience of a sinful course; viz. That the reflection upon it
   after wards is cause of great shame and confusion of face to us; and
   that

   First, In relation to ourselves. Which I have dispatched, and proceed
   now, in the

   Second place, to consider sin in respect of God, against whom, and in
   whose sight and presence, it is committed; and upon examination it will
   appear to be no less shameful in this respect than the other.

   There are some persons before whom we are more apt to be ashamed and
   blush, than before others; as those, whom we reverence, those to whom
   we are greatly obliged, and those who are clear of those faults which
   we are guilty of; and, those who hale or greatly dislike what we do.
   especially if they be present with us, and in our company, if they
   stand by us, and observe, and take notice of what we do, and are likely
   to publish our folly and make it known, and have authority and power to
   punish us for our faults; we are ashamed to have done any thing that is
   vile and unworthy before such persons. Now to render sin the more
   shameful, God may be considered by us under all these notions, and in
   all these respects. I. Whenever we commit any sin, we do it before him,
   in his presence, and under his eye and knowledge, to whom of all
   persons in the world we ought to pay the most profound reverence. I
   remember Seneca somewhere says, that "There are some persons, quorum
   interventu perditi quoque homines vitia supprimerent, that are so awful
   and so gene rally reverenced for the eminency of their virtues, that
   even the most profligate and impudent sinners will endeavour to
   suppress their vices, and refrain from any thing that is notoriously
   bad and uncomely, whilst such persons stand by them, and are in
   presence." Such an one was Cato among the Romans. The people of Rome
   had such a regard and reverence for him, that if he appeared, they
   would not begin or continue their usual sports, until he was withdrawn
   from the theatre, thinking them too light to be acted before a person
   of his gravity and virtue: and if they were so much awed by the
   presence of a wise and a virtuous man, that they were ashamed to do any
   thing that was unseemly before him; how much more should the presence
   of the holy God, who is "of purer eyes than to behold iniquity," make
   us blush to do any thing that is lewd and vile in his sight, and fill
   us with shame and confusion of face at the thoughts of it? Now whenever
   we commit any sin, God looks upon us; and he alone is an ample theatre
   indeed. That he observes what we do, ought to be more to us, than if
   the eyes of all the world besides were gazing upon us.

   2. He likewise is incomparably our greatest benefactor; and there is no
   person in the world to whom, in any degree, we stand so much obliged,
   as to him; and from whom we can expect and hope for so much good, as
   from him; the consideration whereof must make us ashamed, so often as
   we consider, and are conscious to ourselves, that we have done any
   thing that is grievous and displeasing to him.

   We are wont to have a more peculiar reverence for those to whom we are
   exceedingly beholden, and to be much ashamed to do any thing before
   them which may signify disrespect, and much more enmity against them;
   because this would be horrible ingratitude, one of the most odious and
   shameful of all vices. And is there any one to whom we can stand more
   obliged, than to him that made us, than to the author and founder of
   our beings, and the great patron and preserver of our lives? and can
   there then be any before whom, and against whom, we should be more
   ashamed to offend? When the prodigal in the parable would set forth the
   shamefulness of his miscarriage, he aggravates it from hence, that he
   had offended against and before one to whom he had been so infinitely
   obliged: "Father (says he), I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy
   sight."

   3. We are ashamed likewise to be guilty of any fault or crime before
   those persons who are clear of it, or of any thing of the like nature,
   themselves. Men are not apt to be ashamed before those who are their
   fellow-criminals, and involved with them in the same guilt, because
   they do not stand in awe of them, nor can have any reverence for them.
   Those who are equally guilty, must bear with one another. We are not
   apt to fear the censures and reproofs of those who are as bad as
   ourselves; but we are ashamed to do a foul and unworthy action before
   those who are innocent and free from the same, or the like sins and
   vices which we are guilty of.

   Now, whenever we commit any sin it is in the presence of the Holy
   Ghost, who hath no part with us in our crimes, whose nature is removed
   at the farthest distance from sin, and is as contrary to it as can be.
   "There is no iniquity with the Lord our God." And therefore, of all
   persons in the world, we should blush to be guilty of it before him.

   4. We are apt also to be ashamed to do any thing before those who
   dislike and detest what we do. To do a wicked action before those who
   are not offended at it, or perhaps take pleasure in it, is no such
   matter of shame to us. Now, of all others, God is the greatest hater of
   sin, and the most perfect enemy to it in the whole world. (Hab. i. 3.)
   "Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on
   iniquity;" i. e. with patience, and without an in finite hatred and
   abhorrence of it. Such is the unspotted purity and perfection of the
   Divine nature, that it is not possible that God should give the least
   countenance to any thing that is evil. (Psal. v. 4, 5.) "Thou art not a
   God (says David there to him.) that hast pleasure in iniquity, neither
   shall evil dwell with thee: the wicked shall not stand in thy sight;
   thou hatest all workers of iniquity."

   5. We are ashamed likewise to do any thing that is evil and unseemly
   before those who we are afraid will publish our faults to others, and
   will make known and expose the folly of them. Now when ever we sin, it
   is before him who will most certainly one day bring all our works of
   darkness into the open light, and expose all our secret deeds of
   dishonesty upon the public stage of the world, and make all the vilest
   of our actions known, and lay them open, with all the shameful
   circumstances of them, before men and angels, to our everlasting shame
   and confusion. This is the meaning of that proverbial speech, so often
   used by our Saviour, "There is nothing covered that shall not be
   revealed, neither hid that shall not be made manifest." All the sins
   which we now commit with so much caution, in secret and dark
   retirements, shall in that great clay of revelation when the secrets of
   all hearts shall be disclosed, be set in open view, and in so full and
   strong a light, that all the world shall see them, and that which was
   plotted and contrived in so much secrecy, and hardly whispered in this
   world, shall then be proclaimed aloud, and as it were upon the
   house-tops.

   6. And lastly, We are ashamed and afraid to commit a fault before those
   who we believe will call us to an account for it, and punish us
   severely. A man may suffer innocently, and for a good cause; but all
   suffering, in that case, is by wise and good men esteemed honourable
   and glorious, and though we are condemned by men, we are acquitted in
   our own consciences: but that which is properly called punishment is
   always attended with infamy and reproach; because it always supposeth
   some fault and crime, as the ground and reason of it. Hence it is that
   in this world men are not only afraid, but ashamed, to commit any fault
   before those who they think have authority and power to punish it. He
   is an impudent villain, indeed, that will venture to cut a purse in the
   presence of the judge.

   Now whenever we commit any wickedness, we do it under the eye of the
   great Judge of the world, who steadfastly beholds us, and whose
   omnipotent justice stands by us ready armed and charged for our
   destruction, and can in a moment cut us off. Every sin that we are
   guilty of, in thought, word, or deed, is all in the presence of the
   holy, and just, and powerful God; whose power enables him, and whose
   holiness and justice will effectually engage him, one time or other, if
   a timely repentance doth not prevent it, to inflict a terrible
   punishment upon all the workers of iniquity.

   You see then by all that hath been said upon this argument, how
   shameful a thing sin is, and what confusion of face the reflection upon
   our wicked lives ought to cause in all of us. "What fruit had ye then
   in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed?" If ever we are brought to
   a true repentance for our sins, it cannot but be matter of great shame
   to us.

   We find, in Scripture, that shame doth continually accompany
   repentance, and is inseparable from it. This is one mark and character
   of a true penitent, that he is ashamed of what he hath done. Thus Ezra,
   when he makes confession of the sins of the people, he testifies and
   declares his shame for what they had done; "I said, O my God! I am
   ashamed, and brush to lift up mine eyes to thee, my God; for our
   iniquities are increased over our heads, and oar trespasses are grown
   up to the heavens." (Ezra ix. 6.) And may not we of this nation at this
   day take these words unto ourselves, considering to what a strange
   height our sins are grown, and how iniquity abounds among us? So
   likewise the prophet Jeremiah, when he would express the repentance of
   the people of Israel. (Jer. iii. 25.) "We lie down (says he) in our
   shame, and our confusion covereth us, because we have sinned against
   the Lord our God." In like manner the prophet Daniel, after he had in
   the name of the people made a humble acknowledgment of their manifold
   and great sins, he takes shame to himself and them for them: (Dan. ix.
   5, &c.) "We have sinned (says he), and have committed iniquity, and
   have done wickedly, and have rebelled in departing from thy precepts,
   and from thy judgments. O Lord, righteousness belongeth to thee; but
   unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to
   the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and
   that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven
   them, because of their trespass which they have trespassed against
   thee: O Lord! to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our
   princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee." By
   which we may judge, how considerable and essential a part of repentance
   this holy man esteemed shame, for the sins they had been guilty of, to
   be. And, indeed, upon all occasions of solemn repentance and
   humiliation for sin, this taking shame for their sins is hardly ever
   omitted, as if there could be no sincere confession of sin and
   repentance for it, without testifying their shame and confusion of face
   upon the remembrance of their sins.

   Now to stir up this affection of shame in us, let me offer to you these
   three considerations:

   I. Consider what great reason we have to be heartily ashamed of all the
   sins and offences which we have been guilty of against God. It was a
   good old precept of philosophy, "that we should reverence ourselves;"
   i. e. that we should never do any thing that should be matter of shame
   and reproach to us afterwards, nothing that misbecomes us, and is
   unworthy of us.

   I have shewn, at large, that all sin and vice is a dishonour to our
   nature, and beneath the dignity of it; that it is a great reproach to
   our reason, and directly contrary to our true and best interest; that
   it hath all the aggravating circumstances of infamy and shame; that
   every sin that was at any time committed by us, was done in the
   presence of one, whom of all persons in the world we have most reason
   to reverence, and against him, to whom of all others we stand most
   obliged for the greatest favours, for innumerable benefits, for
   infinite mercy, and patience, and forbearance towards us, in the
   presence of the holy and just God, who is at the farthest distance from
   sin, and the greatest and most implacable enemy to it in the whole
   world; and who will one day punish all our faults, and expose us to
   open shame for them; who will "bring every work into judgment, and
   every secret sin" that ever we committed, and take vengeance upon us
   for all our iniquities. So that whenever we sin we shamefully entreat
   ourselves, and give the deepest wounds to our reputation in the esteem
   of him, who is the most competent judge of what is truly honourable and
   praiseworthy, and clothe ourselves with shame and dishonour.

   We are ashamed of poverty, because the poor man is despised, and almost
   ridiculous in the eye of the proud and covetous rich man, "whose riches
   are his high tower," and make him apt to look down upon the poor man
   that is below him with contempt and scorn; we are ashamed of a
   dangerous and contagious disease, because all men fly infectious
   company; but a man may be poor or sick by misfortune; but no man is
   wicked, but by his own fault and wilful choice. Ill-natured and
   inconsiderate men will be apt to contemn us for our poverty and
   affliction in any kind, but by our vices we render ourselves odious to
   God, and to all good and considerate men.

   II. Consider that shame for sin now, is the way to prevent eternal
   shame and confusion hereafter. For this is one great part of the misery
   of another world, that the sinner shall then be filled with everlasting
   shame and confusion at the remembrance of his faults and folly. The
   eternal misery of wicked men is sometimes in Scripture represented, as
   if it consisted only, or chiefly, in the infamy and reproach which will
   then overwhelm them, when all their crimes and faults shall be exposed
   and laid open to the view of the whole world: (Dan. xii. 2.) where the
   general resurrection of the just and unjust is thus described: "Many of
   them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to
   everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt;" where
   "everlasting life" and "everlasting shame" are opposed, as if eternal
   shame were a kind of perpetual death.

   In this world sinners make a hard shift, by concealing or extenuating
   their faults, as well as they can, to suppress or lessen their shame;
   they have not now so clear and full a conviction of the evil and folly
   of their sin: God is pleased to bear with them, and to spare them at
   present, and they do not yet feel the dismal effects and consequences
   of a wicked life: but in the next world, when "the righteous judgment
   of God is revealed," and the full vials of his wrath shall be poured
   forth upon sinners, they shall then "be clothed with shame as with a
   garment, and be covered with confusion;" then they will feel the folly
   of their sins, and have a sensible demonstration within themselves of
   the in finite evil of them; their own consciences will then furiously
   fly in their faces, and with the greatest bitterness and rage upbraid
   and reproach them with the folly of their own doings; and so long as we
   are sensible that we suffer for our own folly, so long we must
   unavoidably be ashamed of what we have done. So that if sinners shall
   be everlastingly tormented in another world, it necessarily follows,
   that they shall be eternally confounded.

   Is it not then better to remember our ways now, and to be ashamed and
   repent of them, than to bring everlasting shame and confusion upon
   ourselves, before God, and angels, and men? This is the argument which
   St. John useth, to take men off from sin, and to engage them to
   holiness and righteousness of life; (1 John ii. 28.) "That when he
   shall appear," that is, when he shall come to judge the world, "we may
   have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."

   III. And lastly, Consider that nothing sets men at a farther distance
   from repentance, and all hopes of their becoming better, and brings
   them nearer to ruin, than impudence in a sinful course. There are too
   many in the world who are so far from being ashamed of their
   wickedness, and blushing at the mention of their faults, that they
   boast of them, and glory in them. God often complains of this in the
   people of Israel, as a sad presage of their ruin, and an ill sign of
   their desperate and irrecoverable condition: (Jer. iii. 3.) "Thou hadst
   a whore's forehead, and refusedst to be ashamed;" and (Jer. vi. 15.)
   "Were they ashamed when they committed abominations? Nay, they were not
   ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them
   that fall, and in the time that I visit them they shall be cast down."
   Hear, likewise, how the apostle doth lament the case of such persons,
   as incurable, and past all remedy: (Philip. iii. 18, 19.) "There are
   many of whom I have told you often, and now tell you, even weeping,
   that they are enemies to the cross of Christ: whose end is destruction,
   whose God is their belly, whose glory is in their shame." Such persons
   who glory in that which ought to be their shame, what can their end be
   but destruction?

   There is certainly no greater argument of a degenerate person, and of
   one that is utterly lost to all sense of goodness, than to be void of
   shame: and as, on the one hand, they must be very towardly, and
   well-disposed to virtue, who are drawn by ingenuity, and mere sense of
   obligation and kindness: so, on the other hand, they must be very
   stupid and insensible, who are not wrought upon by arguments of fear
   and sense of shame. There is hardly any hopes of that man who is not to
   be reclaimed from an evil course, neither by the apprehension of
   danger, nor of disgrace, and who can at once securely neglect both his
   safety and reputation.

   Hear how the prophet represents the deplorable case of such persons:
   (Isa. iii. 9.) "The show of their countenance bears witness against
   them;" in the Hebrew it is, "The hardness of their countenance doth
   testify against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it
   not. Woe unto their souls, for they have rewarded evil to themselves."
   When men are once arrived to that pitch of impiety, as to harden their
   foreheads against all sense and show of shame, and so as to be able to
   set a good face upon the foulest matter in the world, "Woe unto them,"
   because their case seems then to be desperate, and past all hopes of
   recovery. For who can hope that a man will forsake his sins, when he is
   not so much as ashamed of them? But yet one would think, that those who
   are not ashamed of their impiety, should be ashamed of their impudence,
   and should at least blush at this, that they can do the vilest and the
   most shameful things in the world without blushing.

   To conclude this whole discourse, let the consideration of the evil and
   shamefulness of sin have this double effect upon us, to make us
   heartily ashamed of the past errors and miscarriages of our lives, and
   firmly resolved to do better for the future.

   I. To be heartily ashamed of the past errors of our lives. So often as
   we reflect upon the manifold and heinous provocations of the Divine
   Majesty, which many of us have been guilty of in the long course of a
   wicked life, together with the heavy aggravations of our sins, by all
   the circumstances that can render them abominable and shameful, not
   only in the eye of God and men, but of our own consciences likewise; we
   have great reason to humble ourselves before God, in a penitent
   acknowledgment of them, and every one of us to say with Job, "Behold, I
   am vile, what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth,
   I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes;" and with Ezra, "O my
   God! I am ashamed, and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for
   our iniquities are increased over our heads, and our trespass is grown
   up unto the heavens: and now, O my God, what shall we say after this?
   for we have forsaken thy commandments;" and with holy Daniel, "We have
   sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly; O Lord!
   righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face." Thus
   we should reproach and upbraid ourselves in the presence of that holy
   God, whom we have so often and so highly offended, and against whom we
   have done as evil things as we could, and say with the prodigal son in
   the parable: "Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before thee, and
   am no more worthy to be called thy son."

   If we would thus take shame to ourselves, and humble ourselves before
   God, he would "be merciful to us miserable sinners;" he would "take
   away all iniquity, and receive us graciously;" and so soon as ever he
   saw us coming towards him, would meet us with joy, and embrace us in
   the arms of his mercy. And then,

   II. As we should be heartily ashamed of the past errors and
   miscarriages of our lives, so we should firmly resolve, by God's grace,
   to do better for the future; never to consent to iniquity, or to do any
   thing which we are convinced is contrary to our duty, and which will be
   matter of shame to us, when we come to look back upon it, and make our
   blood to rise in our faces at the mention or intimation of it; which
   will make us to sneak, and hang down our heads, when we are twitted and
   upbraided with it, and which, if it be not prevented by a timely
   humiliation and repentance, will fill us with horror and amazement,
   with shame and confusion of face, both at the hour of death, and in the
   day of judgment.

   So that when we look into our lives, and examine the actions of them,
   when we consider what we have done, and what our doings have deserved,
   we should, in a due sense of the great and manifold miscarriages of our
   lives, and from a deep sorrow, and shame, and detestation of ourselves
   for them; I say, we should, with that true penitent described in Job,
   take words to ourselves, and say, "Surely it is meet to be said unto
   God, I will not offend any more; that which I know not, teach thou me;
   and if I have done iniquity, I will do no more." And thus I have done
   with the second inconvenience of a sinful and vicious course of life;
   viz. that the reflection upon it afterwards causeth shame; "What fruit
   had you then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed?"

SERMON CLXIV.

  THE FINAL ISSUE OF SIN, AN ARGUMENT FOR REPENTANCE.

   What fruit had ye then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? for
   the end of those things is death. But now, being made free from sin,
   and be come servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the
   end everlasting life.--Rom. vi. 21, 22.

   THESE words are a comparison between a holy and virtuous, and a sinful
   and vicious course of life, and set before us the manifest
   inconveniencies of the one, and the manifold advantages of the other. I
   have entered into a discourse upon the first of these heads; viz. the
   manifest inconveniencies of a sinful and vicious course: and the text
   mentions these three:

   I. That it is unprofitable.

   II. That the reflection upon it afterwards is matter of shame. These
   two I have spoken largely to. I shall now proceed to the

   III. Third and last inconvenience, which the text mentions, of a sinful
   and vicious course of life; viz. that the final issue and consequence
   of these things is very dismal and miserable; "The end of those things
   is death." No fruit then when ye did these things; shame now that you
   come to reflect upon them; and misery and death at the last.

   There are, indeed, almost innumerable considerations and arguments to
   discourage and deter men from sin; the unreasonableness of it in
   itself; the injustice, and disloyalty, and ingratitude of it in respect
   to God; the ill example of it to others: the cruelty of it to
   ourselves; the shame and dishonour that attends it; the grief and
   sorrow which it will cost us, if ever we be brought to a due sense of
   it; the trouble and horror of a guilty conscience, that will
   perpetually haunt us; but above all, the miserable event and sad issue
   of a wicked course of life continued in, and finally unrepented of. The
   temptations to sin may be alluring enough, and look upon us with a
   smiling countenance, and the commission may afford us a short and
   imperfect pleasure; but the remembrance of it will certainly be bitter,
   and the end of it miserable.

   And this consideration is of all others the most apt to work upon the
   generality of men, especially upon the more obstinate and obdurate sort
   of sinners, and those whom no other arguments will penetrate--that,
   whatever the present pleasure and advantage of sin may be, it will be
   bitterness and misery in the end.

   The two former inconveniencies of a sinful course which I lately
   discoursed of, viz. that sin is unprofitable, and that it is shameful,
   are very consider able, and ought to be great arguments against it to
   every sinner, and considerate man: and yet how light are they, and but
   as the very small dust upon the balance, in comparison of that
   insupportable weight of misery which will oppress the sinner at last!
   "Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man
   that doeth evil." This, this is the sting of all, that "the end of
   these things is death."

   It is very usual, in Scripture, to express the greatest happiness and
   the greatest misery by life and death; life being the first and most
   desirable of all other blessings, because it is the foundation of them,
   and that which makes us capable of all the rest. Hence we find, in
   Scripture, that all the blessings of the gospel are summed up in this
   one word: (John xx. 31.) "These things are written that you might
   believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye
   might have life through his name." (1 John iv. 9.) "In this was
   manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his
   only-be gotten Son into the world, that we might live through him." So
   that under this term or notion of life, the Scripture is wont to
   express all happiness to us, and more especially that eternal life
   which is the great promise of the gospel. And this is life by way of
   eminency; as if this frail, and mortal, and miserable life which we
   live here in this world, did not deserve that name.

   And, on the other hand, all the evils which are consequent upon sin,
   especially the dreadful and lasting misery of another world, are called
   by the name of death. "The end of these things is death." So the
   apostle, here in the text, and ver. 23. "The wages of sin is death;"
   not only a temporal death, but such a death as is opposed to eternal
   life: "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life
   through Jesus Christ our Lord." So that death here in the text is
   plainly intended to comprehend in it all those fearful and astonishing
   miseries, where with the wrath of God will pursue and afflict sinners
   in another world.

   But what and how great this misery is, I am not able to declare to you;
   "it hath" no more "entered into the heart of man," than those great and
   glorious things which "God hath laid up for them that love him:" and as
   I would fain hope, that none of us here shall ever have the sad
   experience of it; so none but those who have felt it, are able to give
   a tolerable description of the intolerableness of it.

   But by what the Scripture hath said of it in general, and in such
   metaphors as are most level to our present capacity, it appears so full
   of terror, that I am loath to attempt the representation of it. There
   are so many other arguments that are more humane and natural, and more
   proper to work upon the reason and ingenuity of men; as, the great love
   and kindness of God to us; the grievous sufferings of his Son for us;
   the unreasonableness and shamefulness of sin; the present benefit and
   advantage, the peace and pleasure, of a holy and virtuous life; and the
   mighty rewards promised to it in another world; that one would think
   these should be abundantly sufficient to prevail with men to gain them
   to goodness, and that they need not be frighted into it, and to have
   the law laid to them, as it was once given to the people of Israel, in
   "thunder and lightning, in blackness, in darkness and tempest," so as
   to make them "exceedingly to fear and tremble." And it seems a very
   hard case, that when we have to deal with men sensible enough of their
   interest in other cases, and diligent enough to mind it, we cannot
   persuade them to accept of happiness with out setting before them the
   terrors of eternal darkness, and those amazing and endless miseries
   which will certainly be the portion of those who refuse so great a
   happiness: this, I say, seems very hard, that men must be carried to
   the gate of hell before they can be brought to set their faces towards
   heaven, and to think in good earnest of getting thither.

   And yet it cannot be dissembled, that the nature of men is so
   degenerate as to stand in need of this argument; and that men are so
   far engaged in an evil course, that they are not to be reclaimed from
   it by any other consideration but of the endless and unspeakable misery
   of impenitent sinners in another world. And therefore God, knowing how
   necessary this is, doth frequently make use of it; and our blessed
   Saviour, than whom none was ever more mild and gentle, doth often set
   this consideration before men, to take them off from sin, and to bring
   them to do better. And this, St. Paul tells us, (Rom. i. 18.) is one
   principal thing which renders the gospel so powerful an instrument for
   the reforming and saving of mankind, because "therein the wrath of God
   is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men."

   So that, how harsh and unpleasant soever this argument may be, the
   great stupidity and folly of some men, and their inveterate obstinacy
   in an evil course, makes it necessary for us to press it home, that
   those who will not be moved, and made sensible of the danger and
   inconvenience of sin by gentler arguments, may be roused and awakened
   by the terrors of eternal misery.

   That the last issue and consequence of a wicked life will be very
   miserable, the general apprehension of mankind concerning the fate of
   bad men in another world, and the secret misgivings of men's
   consciences, give men too much ground to fear. Besides that, the
   justice of Divine providence, which is not many times in this world so
   clear and manifest, does seem to require that there should be a time of
   recompence, when the virtue and patience of good men should be
   rewarded, and the insolence and obstinacy of bad men should be
   punished. This cannot but appear very reasonable to any man that
   considers the nature of God, and is persuaded that he governs the
   world, and hath given laws to mankind, by the observance whereof they
   may be happy, and by the neglect and contempt whereof they must be
   miserable.

   But, that there might remain no doubts upon the minds of men concerning
   these matters, God hath been pleased to reveal this from heaven, by a
   person sent by him on purpose to declare it to the world; and to the
   truth of these doctrines concerning a future state, and a day of
   judgment, and recompences, God hath given testimony by unquestionable
   miracles wrought for the confirmation of them, and particularly by "the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, whereby he hath given an
   assurance unto all men, that he is the person ordained by God to judge
   the world in righteousness, and to render to every man according to his
   deeds; to them who, by patient continuance in well doing, seek for
   glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life; but to them who obey
   not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
   tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil."

   So that, how quietly soever wicked men may pass through this world, or
   out of it (which they seldom do), misery will certainly overtake their
   sins at last; unspeakable and intolerable misery, arising from the
   anguish of a guilty conscience, from a lively apprehension of their sad
   loss, and from a quick sense of the sharp pain which they labour under;
   and all this aggravated and set off with the consideration of past
   pleasure, and the despair of future ease. Each of these is misery
   enough, and all of them together do constitute and make up that dismal
   and forlorn state which the Scripture calls hell and damnation.

   I shall, therefore, briefly represent (for it is by no means desirable
   to dwell long upon so melancholy and frightful an argument),

   First, The principal ingredients which constitute this miserable state.
   And,

   Secondly, The aggravations of it.

   First, The principal ingredients which constitute this miserable state;
   and they are these three which I have mentioned:

   I. The anguish of a guilty mind.

   II. The lively apprehensions of the invaluable happiness which they
   have lost.

   III. A quick sense of the intolerable pains which they lie under.

   I. The anguish of a guilty conscience. And this is natural; for there
   is a worm that abides in a guilty conscience, and is continually
   gnawing it. This is that our Saviour calls "the worm that dies not."
   And though God should inflict no positive punishment upon sinners, yet
   this is a revenge which every man's mind would take upon him; for
   things are so ordered by God in the original frame and constitution of
   our minds, that, on the one hand, peace and pleasure, contentment and
   satisfaction, do naturally arise in our minds from the conscience of
   well-doing, and spring up in the soul of every good man: and, on the
   other hand, no man knowingly does an evil action, but his guilty
   conscience galls him for it, and the remembrance of it is full of
   bitterness to him.

   And this the sinner feels in this world; he disguiseth and dissembleth
   his trouble as much as he can, and shifts off these uneasy thoughts by
   all the diversions he can devise, and by this means palliates his
   disease, and renders his condition in some sort tolerable unto himself;
   but when he is alone, or cast upon the bed of sickness, and his
   thoughts are let loose upon him, and he hath nothing to give them a
   diversion, how does his guilt ferment and work! And the fever, which
   lurked before, does now shew itself, and is ready to burn him up; so
   that nothing can appear more dismal and ghastly, than such a man does
   to himself.

   And much more, when sinners come into the other world, and are entered
   into the regions of darkness, and the melancholy shades where evil
   spirits are continually wandering up and down, where they can meet with
   nothing either of employment or pleasure, to give the least diversion
   to their pensive minds; where they shall find nothing to do, but to
   reflect upon and bemoan themselves; where all the wicked actions that
   ever they committed shall come fresh into their minds, and stare their
   consciences in the face. It is not to be imagined what sad scenes will
   then be present to their imaginations, and what sharp reflections their
   own guilty minds will make upon them, and what swarms of furies will
   possess them.

   So soon as ever they are entered upon that state, they will then find
   themselves forsaken of all those comforts which they once placed so
   much happiness in; and they will have nothing to converse with but
   their own uneasy selves, and those that are as miserable as themselves,
   and therefore incapable of administering any comfort to one another.
   They will then have nothing to think on but what will trouble them; and
   every new thought will be a new in crease of their trouble. Their guilt
   will make them restless, and the more restless they are, the more will
   their minds be enraged; and there will be no end of their vexation,
   because the cause and ground of it is perpetual. For there is no
   possible way to get rid of guilt but by repentance; and there is no
   encouragement, no argument, to repentance, where there is no hope of
   pardon. So that if God should hold his hand and leave sinners to
   themselves, and to the lashes of their own conscience, a more severe
   and terrible torment can hardly be imagined, than that which a guilty
   mind would execute upon itself.

   II. Another ingredient into the miseries of sinners in another world,
   is the lively apprehension of the invaluable happiness which they have
   lost by their own obstinacy and foolish choice. In the next world
   wicked men shall be for ever separated from God, who is the fountain of
   happiness, and from all the comforts of his presence and favour. This,
   our Saviour tells us, is the first part of that dreadful sentence that
   shall be passed upon the wicked at the great day, "Depart from me;"
   which words, though they do not signify any positive infliction and
   torment, yet they import the greatest loss that can be imagined. And it
   is not so easy to determine which is the greatest of evils, loss or
   pain. Indeed, to a creature that is only endowed with sense, there can
   be no misery but that of pain and suffering: but to those who have
   reason and understanding, and are capable of knowing the value of
   things, and of reflecting upon themselves in the want of them, the
   greatest loss may be as grievous and hard to be borne as the greatest
   pain.

   It is true, that sinners are now so immersed in the gross and sensual
   delights of this world, that they have no apprehension of the joys of
   heaven, and the pleasures of God's presence, and of the happiness that
   is to be enjoyed in communion with him, and therefore they are not now
   capable of estimating the greatness of this loss. But this
   insensibleness of wicked men continues no longer than this present
   state, which affords them variety of objects of pleasure and of
   business to divert them and entertain them: but when they come into the
   other world, they shall then have nothing else to think upon, but the
   sad condition into which they have brought themselves, nothing to do
   but to pore and meditate upon their own misfortune, when they shall
   lift up their eyes, and, with the rich man in the parable, in the midst
   of their torments, look up to those who are in Abraham's bosom; and
   their misery will be mightily increased by the contemplation of that
   happiness which others enjoy, and themselves have so foolishly
   forfeited and fallen short of; insomuch, that it would be happy for
   them if that God, from whose presence they are banished, that heaven
   from which they have excluded themselves, and that everlasting glory
   which they have despised and neglected, might be for ever hid from
   their eyes, and never come into their minds.

   III. This is not all, but besides the sad apprehension of their loss,
   they shall endure the sharpest pains. These God hath threatened sinners
   withal, and they are in Scripture represented to us, by the most
   grievous and intolerable pains that in this world we are acquainted
   withal; as, by the pain of burning. Hence the wicked are said to be
   "cast into the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, and into the
   fire which is not quenched;" which, whether it be literally to be
   understood or not, is certainly intended to signify the most severe
   kind of torment; but what that is, and in what manner it shall be
   inflicted, none know but they that feel it, and lie under it. The
   Scripture tells so much in general of it, as is enough to warn men to
   avoid it; that it is the effect of a mighty displeasure, and of anger
   armed with omnipotence, and consequently must needs be very terrible,
   more dreadful than we can now conceive, and probably greater than can
   be described by any of those pains and sufferings which now we are
   acquainted withal; for "who knows the power of God's anger," and the
   utmost of what almighty justice can do to sinners? Who can comprehend
   the vast significancy of those expressions, "Fear him who, after he
   hath killed, can destroy both body and soul in hell?" And again, "It is
   a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!" One would
   think this were misery enough, and needed no farther aggravation; and
   yet it hath two terrible ones, from the consideration of past pleasures
   which sinners have enjoyed in this world, and from an utter despair of
   future ease and remedy.

   1. From the consideration of the past pleasures which sinners have
   enjoyed in this life. This will make their sufferings much more sharp
   and sensible; for, as nothing commends pleasure more, and give
   happiness a quicker taste and relish, than precedent sufferings and
   pain, there is not perhaps a greater pleasure in the world, than the
   strange and sudden ease which a man finds after a sharp fit of the
   stone or cholic, or after a man is taken off the rack, and nature which
   was in an agony before is all at once set at perfect ease: so, on the
   other hand, nothing exasperates suffering more, and sets a keener edge
   upon misery, than to step into afflictions and pain immediately out of
   a state of great ease and pleasure. This we find in the parable was the
   great aggravation of the rich man's torment, that he had first received
   good things, and was afterwards tormented. We may do well to consider
   this, that those pleasures of sin which have now so much of temptation
   in them, will in the next world be one of the chief aggravations of our
   torment.

   2. The greatest aggravation of this misery will be, that it is attended
   with the despair of any future ease; and when misery and despair meet
   together, they make a man completely miserable. The duration of this
   misery is expressed to us in Scripture, by such words as are used to
   signify the longest and most interminable duration. "Depart ye cursed
   into everlasting fire," (Matt. xxv. 41.) "Where the worm dieth not, and
   the fire is not quenched," (Mark ix. 44.) And (2 Thess. i. 7.) it is
   there said, that "those who know not God, and obey not the gospel of
   his Son, shall be punished with everlasting destruction, from the
   presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." And (Rev. xx.
   10.) that "the wicked shall be tormented day and night for ever and
   ever." And what can be imagined beyond this? This is the perfection of
   misery, to lie under the greatest torment, and yet be in despair of
   ever finding the least ease.

   And thus I have done with the first thing I propounded to speak to from
   this text; viz. The manifest inconveniencies of a sinful and vicious
   course of life; that it brings no present benefit or advantage to us;
   that the reflection upon it causeth shame; and that it is fearful and
   miserable in the last issue and consequence of it. "What fruit had
   you," &c.

   I should now have proceeded to the second part of the text, which
   represents to us the manifold advantages of a holy and virtuous course
   of life: (ver. 22.) "But now being made free from sin and become the
   servants of righteousness, ye have your fruit unto holiness;" there is
   the present advantage of it: "and the end everlasting life;" there is
   the future reward of it. But this is a large argument, which will
   require a discourse by itself, and therefore I shall not now enter upon
   it; but shall only make some reflections upon what hath been said,
   concerning the miserable issue and consequence of a wicked life
   impenitently persisted in.

   And surely, if we firmly believe and seriously consider these things,
   we have no reason to be fond of any vice; we can take no great comfort
   or contentment in a sinful course. If we could, for the seeming
   advantage and short pleasure of some sins, dispense with the temporal
   mischiefs and inconveniencies of them, which yet I cannot see how any
   prudent and considerate man could do: if we could conquer shame, and
   bear the infamy and reproach which attends most sins, and could digest
   the upbraidings of our own consciences, so often as we call them to
   remembrance, and reflect seriously upon them; though for the gratifying
   an importunate inclination, and an impetuous appetite, all the
   inconveniencies of them might be born withal; yet methinks the very
   thought of the end and issue of a wicked life, that "the end of these
   things is death," that "indignation and wrath, tribulation and
   anguish," far greater than we can now describe, or imagine, "shall be
   to every soul of man that doeth evil," should overrule us. Though the
   violence of an irregular lust and desire are able to bear down all
   other arguments, yet methinks the eternal interest of our precious and
   immortal souls should still lie near our hearts, and affect us very
   sensibly. Methinks the consideration of another world, and of all
   eternity, and of that dismal fate which at tends impenitent sinners
   after this life, and the dreadful hazard of being miserable for ever,
   should be more than enough to dishearten any man from a wicked life,
   and to bring him to a better mind and course.

   And if the plain representations of these things do not prevail with
   men to this purpose, it is a sign that either they do not believe these
   things, or else that they do not consider them; one of these two must
   be the reason why any man, notwithstanding these terrible threatenings
   of God's word, does venture to continue in an evil course.

   It is vehemently to be suspected, that men do not really believe these
   things, that they are not fully persuaded that there is another state
   after this life, in which the righteous God "will render to every man
   according to his deeds:" and, therefore, so much wickedness as we see
   in the lives of men, so much infidelity may reasonably be suspected to
   lie lurking in their hearts. They may indeed seemingly profess to
   believe these things; but he that would know what a man inwardly and
   firmly believes should attend rather to his actions than to his verbal
   professions: for if any man lives so, as no man that believes the
   principles of the Christian religion in reason can live, there is too
   much reason to question whether that man doth believe his religion; he
   may say he does, but there is a far greater evidence in the case than
   words; the actions of the man are by far the most credible declarations
   of the inward sense and persuasion of his mind.

   Did men firmly and heartily believe that there is a God that governs
   the world, and regards the actions of men, and that "he hath appointed
   a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness," and that all
   mankind shall appear before him in that day, and every action that they
   have done in their whole lives shall be brought upon the stage, and
   pass a strict examination and censure, and that those who have made
   conscience of their duty to God and men, and have "lived soberly,
   righteously, and godly, in this present world," shall be unspeakably
   and eternally happy in the next; but those who have lived lewd and
   licentious lives, and persisted in an impenitent course, shall be
   extremely and everlastingly miserable, without pity, and without
   comfort, and without remedy, and with out hope of ever being otherwise;
   I say, if men were fully and firmly persuaded of these things, it is
   not credible, it is hardly possible that they should live such profane
   and impious, such careless and dissolute lives, as we daily see a great
   part of man kind do.

   That man that can be awed from his duty, or tempted to sin, by any of
   the pleasures or terrors of this world, that for the present enjoyment
   of his lusts can be contented to venture his soul, what greater
   evidence than this can there be, that this man does not believe the
   threatenings of the gospel, and how "fearful a thing it is to fall into
   the hands of the living God?" That man that can be willing to undergo a
   hard service for several years, that he may be in a way to get an
   estate, and be rich in this world, and yet will not be persuaded to
   restrain himself of his liberty, or to deny his pleasure, or to check
   his appetite or lust, for the greatest reward that God can promise, or
   the severest punishment that he can threaten; can any man reasonably
   think, that this man is persuaded of any such happiness or misery after
   this life, as is plainly revealed in the gospel, that "verily there is
   a reward for the righteous, and verily there is a God that judgeth the
   earth?" For what can he that believes not one syllable of the Bible do
   worse than this comes to?

   A strong and vigorous faith, even in temporal cases, is a powerful
   principle of action, especially if it be backed and enforced with
   arguments of fear. He that believes the reality of a thing, and that it
   is good for him, and that it may be attained, and that if he doth
   attain it, it will make him very happy, and that without it he shall be
   extremely miserable; such a belief and persuasion will put a man upon
   difficult things, and make him to put forth a vigorous endeavour, and
   to use a mighty industry for the obtaining of that, concerning which he
   is thus persuaded.

   And the faith of the gospel ought to be so much the more powerful, by
   how much the objects of hope and fear, which it presents to us, are
   greater and more considerable. Did men fully believe the happiness of
   heaven, and the torments of hell, and were they as verily persuaded of
   the truth of them, as if they were before their eyes, how insignificant
   would all the terrors and temptations of sense be to draw them into
   sin, and seduce them from their duty?

   But, although it seems very strange, and almost incredible, that men
   should believe these things, and yet live wicked and impious lives;
   yet, because I have no mind, and God knows there is no need, to
   increase the number of infidels in this age, I shall choose rather to
   impute a great deal of the wickedness that is in the world to the
   inconsiderateness of men, than to their unbelief. I will grant that
   they do in some sort believe these things, or at least that they do not
   disbelieve them; and then the great cause of men's ruin must be, that
   they do not attend to the consequence of this belief, and how men ought
   to live that are thus persuaded. Men stifle their reason, and suffer
   themselves to be hurried away by sense, into the embraces of sensual
   objects and things present, but do not consider what the end of these
   things will be, and what is like to become of them hereafter; for it is
   not to be imagined, but that that man who shall calmly consider with
   himself what sin is, the shortness of its pleasure, and the eternity of
   its punishment, should seriously resolve upon a better course of life.

   And why do we not consider these things, which are of so infinite
   concernment to us? What have we our reason for, but to reflect upon
   ourselves, and to mind what we do, and wisely to compare things
   together, and, upon the whole matter, to judge what makes most for our
   true and lasting interest? To consider our whole selves, our souls as
   well as our bodies, and our whole duration, not only in this world, but
   in the other, not only with regard to time, but to eternity? To look
   before us to the last issue and event of our actions, and to the
   farthest consequence of them, and to reckon upon what will be
   hereafter, as well as what is present; and if we suspect, or hope, or
   fear, especially if we have good reason to believe, a future state
   after death, in which we shall be happy or miserable to all eternity,
   according as we manage and behave ourselves in this world, to resolve
   to make it our greatest design and concernment while we are in this
   world, so to live and demean ourselves, that we may be of the number of
   those that shall be accounted worthy to escape that misery, and to
   obtain that happiness, which will last and continue for ever?

   And if men would but apply their minds seriously to the consideration
   of these things, they could not act so imprudently as they do; they
   would not live so by chance, and without design, taking the pleasure
   that comes next, and avoiding the present evils which press upon them,
   without any regard to those that are future, and at a distance, though
   they be infinitely greater and more considerable: if men could have the
   patience to debate and argue these matters with themselves, they could
   not live so preposterously as they do, preferring their bodies before
   their souls, and the world before God, and the things which are
   temporal before the things that are eternal.

   Did men verily and in good earnest believe but half of that to be true
   which hath now been declared to you, concerning the miserable state of
   impenitent sinners in another world; (and I am very sure, that the one
   half of that which is true concerning that state hath not been told
   you;) I say, did we in any measure believe what hath been so
   imperfectly represented, "What manner of persons should we all be, in
   all holy conversation and godliness, waiting for and hastening unto
   (that is, making haste to make the best preparation we could for) the
   coming of the day of God!"

   I will conclude all with our Saviour's exhortation to his disciples,
   and to all others; "Watch ye therefore and pray always, that ye may be
   accounted worthy to escape all these things, and to stand before the
   Son of man: to whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be all honour
   and glory, world without end. Amen."

SERMON CLXV.

  THE PRESENT AND FUTURE ADVANTAGE OF A HOLY AND VIRTUOUS LIFE.

   What fruit had ye then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? For
   the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and
   become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end
   everlasting life.--Rom. vi. 21, 22.

   I HAVE several times told you, that the apostle in these words makes a
   comparison between a holy and virtuous, and a sinful and vicious course
   of life;, and sets before us the manifest inconveniences of the one,
   and the manifold advantages of the other.

   I have finished my discourse upon the first part of the comparison--the
   manifest inconveniences of a sinful and vicious course. I proceed now
   to the other part of the comparison, which was the

   Second thing I propounded to speak to from these words; viz. the
   manifold benefits and advantages of a holy and virtuous course; and
   that upon these two accounts:

   First, Of the present benefit and advantage of it, which the apostle
   here calls fruit, "Ye have your fruit unto holiness."

   Secondly, In respect of the future reward of it, "and the end
   everlasting life." So that here is a considerable earnest in hand,
   besides a mighty recompence afterwards, infinitely beyond the
   proportion of our best actions and services, both in regard of the
   greatness and duration of it, "everlasting life;" that is, for a few
   transient acts of obedience, a perfect, and immutable, and endless
   state of happiness. And these two the apostle mentions in opposition to
   the inconveniencies and evil consequences of a wicked and vicious
   course; "What fruit had you then in those things?" &c.

   But before I come to speak to these two particulars, I shall take
   notice of the description which the apostle here makes of the change
   from a state of sin and vice to a state of holiness and virtue. "But
   now, being made free from sin, and become the servants of God;"
   intimating that the state of sin is a state of servitude and slavery,
   from which repentance and the change which is thereby made does set us
   free; "But now, being made free from sin." And so our Saviour tells us,
   that "whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin;" and this is the
   vilest and hardest slavery in the world, because it is the servitude of
   the soul, the best and noblest part of ourselves; it is the subjection
   of our reason, which ought to rule and bear sway over the inferior
   faculties, to our sensual appetites and brutish passions; which is as
   uncomely a sight, as to see beggars ride on horseback, and princes walk
   on foot. And as inferior persons, when they are advanced to power, are
   strangely insolent and tyrannical towards those that are subject to
   them; so the lusts and passions of men, when they once get the command
   of them, are the most domineering tyrants in the world; and there is no
   such slave as a man that is subject to his appetite and lust, that is
   under the power of irregular passions and vicious inclinations, which
   transport and hurry him to the vilest and most unreasonable things. For
   a wicked man is a slave to as many masters as he hath passions and
   vices: and they are very imperious and exacting; and the more be yields
   to them, the more they grow upon him, and exercise the greater tyranny
   over him; and being subject to so many masters, the poor slave is
   continually divided and distracted between their contrary commands and
   impositions; one passion hurries him one way, and another as violently
   drives him another; one lust commands him upon such a service, and
   another, it may be, at the same time calls him to another work. His
   pride and ambition bids him spend and lay it out, whilst his
   covetousness holds his hand fast closed; so that he knows not many
   times how to dispose of himself, or what to do, he must displease some
   of his masters, and what inclination soever he contradicts, he
   certainly displeaseth himself.

   And that which aggravates the misery of his condition is, that he
   voluntarily submits to this servitude. In other cases men are made
   slaves against their wills, and are brought under the force and power
   of others, whom they are not able to resist; but the sinner chooseth
   this servitude, and willingly puts his neck under this yoke. There are
   few men in the world so sick of their liberty, and so weary of their
   own happiness, as to choose this condition; but the sinner sells
   himself, and voluntarily parts with that liberty which he might keep,
   and which none could take from him.

   And, which makes this condition yet more in tolerable, he makes himself
   a slave to his own servants, to those who are born to be subject to
   him, to his own appetites and passions; and this certainly is the worst
   kind of slavery, so much worse than that of mines and galleys, as the
   soul is more noble and excellent than the body.

   Men are not usually so sensible of the misery of this kind of
   servitude, because they are governed by sense more than reason; but,
   according to a true judgment and estimation of things, a vicious course
   of life is the saddest slavery of all others. And therefore the gospel
   represents it as a design every way worthy of the Son of God, to come
   down from Leaven, and to debase himself so far as to assume our nature,
   and to submit to the death of the cross, on purpose to rescue us from
   this slavery, and to assert us into "the liberty of the sons of God."
   And this is the great design of the doctrine of the gospel, to free men
   from the bondage of their lusts, and to bring them to the service of
   God, "whose service is perfect freedom." And therefore our Saviour
   tells us, (John viii. 31, 32.) that "if we continue in his word," i. e.
   if we obey his doctrine, and frame our lives according to it, it will
   make us free; "Ye shall know (says he) the truth, and the truth shall
   make you free." And if we observe it, the Scripture delights very much
   to set forth to us the benefits and advantages of the Christian
   religion by the metaphor of liberty and redemption from captivity and
   slavery. Hence our Saviour is so often called the Redeemer and
   Deliverer, and is said to have "obtained eternal redemption for us."
   And the publishing of the gospel is compared to the proclaiming of the
   year of jubilee among the Jews, when all persons that would were set at
   liberty. (Isa. lxi. 1, 2.) "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me," saith
   the prophet, speaking in the person of the Messiah, "because he hath
   anointed me to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the
   prison to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the
   Lord." And it is probable that upon this account, likewise, the
   Christian doctrine or law is by St. James called "the royal law of
   liberty."

   This is the great design of Christianity, to set men free from the
   slavery of their lusts; and to this end the apostle tells us, (Tit. ii.
   14.) that "Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
   iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works." And herein the great mercy and compassion of God towards
   mankind appeared, in that he sent his Son to rescue us from that
   servitude which we had long groaned under, "that, being made free from
   sin, we might become the servants of God," and "the servants of
   righteousness."

   And this he hath done, not only by the price of his blood, but by the
   power and purity of his doctrine, and the holy example of his life, and
   by all those considerations which represent to us the misery of our
   sinful state, and the infinite danger of continuing in it; and, on the
   other hand, by setting before us the advantages of a religious and holy
   life; and what a blessed change we make, when we quit the service of
   sin, and become the servants of God. It will not only be a mighty
   present benefit to us, but will make us happy to all eternity; and
   these are the two considerations which, at first, I propounded to speak
   to at this time:

   First, The present benefit of a holy and virtuous life, which the
   apostle here calls fruit; "But now being free from sin, and become the
   servants of God, ye have your fruit unto holiness."

   Secondly, The future reward and recompence of it; "and the end
   everlasting life."

   First, Let us consider the present benefit and advantage of a holy and
   virtuous life, which the apostle here calls fruit. If all things be
   truly considered, there is no advantage comes to any man by a wicked
   and vicious course of life. A wicked life is no present advantage; the
   reflection upon it afterwards is shameful and troublesome, and the end
   of it miserable: but, on the contrary, the advantages of a holy and
   good life are many and great even in this world, and upon temporal
   accounts, abstracting from the consideration of a future reward in the
   world to come.

   I shall instance in five or six eminent advantages which it usually
   brings to men in this world.

   I. It brings great peace and contentment of mind.

   II. It is a very fit and proper means to promote our outward temporal
   interest.

   III. It tends to the lengthening our days, and hath frequently the
   blessing of long life attending upon it.

   IV. It gives a man great peace and comfort when he comes to die.

   V. After death it transmits a good name and reputation to posterity.

   VI. It derives a blessing upon our posterity after us. And these are
   certainly the greatest blessings that a wise man can aim at, and design
   to himself in this world. Every one of these taken severally is very
   considerable; but all of them together complete a man's temporal
   felicity, and raise it to as high a pitch as is to be expected in this
   world.

   I. A religious and virtuous course of life is the best way to peace and
   contentment of mind, and does commonly bring it. And to a wise man,
   that knows how to value the ease and satisfaction of his own mind,
   there cannot be a greater temptation to religion and virtue, than to
   consider that it is the best and only way to give rest to his mind. And
   this is present fruit, and ready payment; because it immediately
   follows, or rather accompanies, the discharge of our duty. "The fruit
   of righteousness is peace," saith the prophet; and the apostle to the
   Hebrews speaks of "the peaceable fruit of righteousness," meaning that
   inward peace which a righteous man hath in his own mind.

   A man needs not to take pains, or to use many arguments, to satisfy and
   content his own mind, after he hath done a good action, and to convince
   himself that he hath no cause to be troubled for it, for peace and
   pleasure do naturally spring from it: nay, not only so, but there is an
   unexpressible kind of pleasure and delight that flows from the
   testimony of a good conscience. Let but a man take care to satisfy
   himself in the doing of his duty, and whatever troubles and storms may
   be raised from without, all will be clear and calm within: for nothing
   but guilt can trouble a man's mind, and fright his conscience, and make
   him uneasy to himself; that indeed will wound his spirit, and sting his
   very soul, and make him full of fearful and tormenting thoughts. This
   Cain found after he had committed that crying sin of murdering his
   brother. (Gen. iv. 6.) "The Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth,
   and why is thy countenance fallen?" His guilt made him full of wrath,
   and discontent filled his mind with vexation, and his countenance with
   shame and confusion. When a man's conscience is awakened to a sense of
   his guilt it is angry and froward, and harder to be stilled than a
   peevish child; but the practice of holiness and virtue does produce
   just the contrary effects; it fills a man's mind with pleasure, and
   makes his countenance cheerful.

   And this certainly, if it be well considered, is no small and
   contemptible advantage. The peace and tranquillity of our minds is the
   great thing which all the philosophy and wisdom of the world did al
   ways design to bring men to, as the very utmost happiness that a wise
   man is capable of in this life: and it is that which no considerate man
   would part with for all that this world can give him. The greatest
   fortune in this world ought to be no temptation to any man in his wits,
   to submit to perpetual sickness and pain for the gaining of it; and yet
   there is no disease in the world, that for the sharpness of it is
   comparable to the sting of a guilty mind y and no pleasure equal to
   that of innocence and a good conscience. And this naturally springs up
   in, the mind of a good man, where it is not hindered either by a
   melancholy temper, or by false principles in religion, which fill a man
   with groundless fears and jealousies of the love and favour of God
   towards him; and excepting these two cases, this is the ordinary fruit
   of a holy and good course, which is not interrupted by frequent falling
   into sin, and great omissions and violations of our duty: for in this
   case the interruptions of our peace and comfort will naturally be
   answerable to the inequality of our obedience.

   II. Besides the present and inestimable fruit of holiness, the quiet
   and satisfaction of our own minds; it is likewise a proper means to
   promote our interest and happiness in this world. For as every vice is
   naturally attended with some temporal inconvenience of pain or loss; so
   there is no grace or virtue, but does apparently conduce to a man's
   temporal felicity. There are some virtues which tend to the health of
   his body, and the prolonging of his life, as temperance and chastity;
   others tend to riches and plenty, as diligence and industry in our
   callings; others to the secure and peaceable enjoyment of what we have,
   as truth and fidelity, justice and honesty in all our dealings and
   intercourse with men. There are other virtues that are apt to oblige
   man kind to us, and to gain their friendship and good will, their aid
   and assistance, as kindness, and meekness, and charity, and a generous
   disposition to do good to all, as far as we have power and opportunity.
   In a word, there is no real interest of this world but may ordinarily
   be as effectually promoted and pursued to as great advantage by a man
   that exercises himself in the practice of all virtue and goodness, and
   usually to far greater advantage, than by one that is intemperate and
   debauched, deceitful and dishonest, apt to disoblige and provoke, sour
   and ill-natured to all mankind: for there is none of these vices but is
   to a man's real hinderance and disadvantage, in regard of one kind of
   happiness or another, which men aim at and propose to themselves in
   this world.

   III. A religious and virtuous course of life doth naturally tend to the
   prolonging of our days, and hath very frequently the blessing of health
   and long life attending upon it. The practice of a great many virtues
   is a great preservative of life and health, as, the due government of
   our appetites and passions, by temperance, and chastity, and meekness,
   which prevent the chief causes from within of bodily diseases and
   distempers; the due government of our tongues and conversation in
   respect of others, by justice and kindness, and abstaining from wrath
   and provocation, which are a great security against the dangers of
   outward violence, according to that of St. Peter, (1 Epist. iii. 10.)
   "He that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue
   from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile; let him eschew evil,
   and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it."

   And beside the natural tendency of things, there is a special blessing
   of God which attends good men, and makes "their days long in the land
   which the Lord their God hath given them."

   IV. There is nothing gives a man so much comfort when he comes to die,
   as the reflection upon a holy and good life: and then surely, above all
   other times, comfort is most valuable, because our frail and infirm
   nature doth then stand most in need of it. Then usually men's hearts
   are faint, and their spirits low, and every thing is apt to deject and
   trouble them; so that we had need to provide ourselves of some
   excellent cordial against that time; and there is no comfort like to
   that of a clear conscience, and of an innocent and useful life. This
   will revive and raise a man's spirits under all the infirmities of his
   body, because it gives a man good hopes concerning his eternal state,
   and the hopes of that are apt to fill a man with "joy unspeakable and
   full of glory."

   The difference between good and bad men is never so remarkable in this
   world, as when they are upon their death-bed. This the Scripture
   observes to us. (Psal. xxxvii. 37.) "Mark the perfect man, and behold
   the upright, for the end of that man is peace."

   With what triumph and exultation doth the blessed apostle St. Paul,
   upon the review of his life, discourse concerning his death and
   dissolution? (2 Tim. iv. 6-8.) "I am now ready (says he) to be offered
   up, and the time of my departure is at hand: I have fought a good
   fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; henceforth
   there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
   righteous Judge, will give me at that day." What would not any of us do
   to be thus affected when we come to leave the world, and to be able to
   bear the thoughts of death and eternity with so quiet and well
   satisfied a mind! Why, let us but endeavour to live holy lives, and to
   be useful and serviceable to God in our generation, as this holy
   apostle was, and we shall have the same ground of joy and triumph which
   he had. For this is the proper and genuine effect of virtue and
   goodness; "The work of righteousness is peace, and the effect of
   righteousness quietness and assurance for ever." All the good actions
   that we do in this life are so many seeds of comfort sown in our own
   consciences, which will spring up one time or other, but especially in
   the approaches of death, when we come to take a serious review of our
   lives; for then men's consciences use to deal plainly and impartially
   with them, and to tell them the truth; and if at that time more
   especially "our hearts condemn us not, then may we have comfort and
   confidence towards God."

   V. A holy and virtuous life doth transmit a good name and reputation to
   posterity. And this Solomon hath determined to be a much greater
   happiness, than for a man to leave a great estate behind him: "A good
   name (says he) is rather to be chosen than great riches." Pious and
   virtuous men do commonly gain to themselves a good esteem and
   reputation in this world, while they are in it; but the virtues of good
   men are not always so bright and shining as to meet with that respect
   and acknowledgment which is due to them in this world. Many times they
   are much clouded by the infirmities and passions which attend them, and
   are shadowed by some affected singularities and morosities, which those
   which have lived more retired from the world are more liable to.
   Besides that, the envy of others, who are not so good as they, lies
   heavy upon them, and does depress them. For bad men are very apt to
   misinterpret the best actions of the good, and put false colours upon
   them, and when they have nothing else to object against them, to charge
   them with hypocrisy and insincerity; an objection as hard to be
   answered, as it is to be made good, unless we could see into the hearts
   of men.

   But when good men are dead and gone, and the bright and shining example
   of their virtues is at a convenient distance, and does not gall and
   upbraid others, then envy ceaseth, and every man is then content to
   give a -good man his due praise, and his friends and posterity may then
   quietly enjoy the comfort of his reputation, which is some sort of
   blessing to him that is gone. This difference Solomon observes to us
   between good and bad men; "The memory of the just is blessed," or well
   spoke of; "but the name of the wicked shall rot."

   VI. And lastly, religion and virtue do derive a blessing upon our
   posterity after us. "O that there were such a heart in them (saith
   Moses, concerning the people of Israel), that they would fear me, and
   keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them and
   their children for ever!" And to this purpose there are many promises
   in Scripture of God's blessing the posterity of the righteous, and his
   shewing mercy "to thousands of the children of them that love him, and
   keep his commandments."

   And this is a great motive to obedience, and toucheth upon that natural
   affection which men bear to their children; so that if we have any
   regard to them, or concernment for their happiness, we ought to be very
   careful of our duty, and afraid to offend God: because, according as we
   demean ourselves towards him, we entail a lasting blessing or a great
   curse upon our children; by so many and so strong bonds hath God tied
   our duty upon us, that if we either desire our own happiness, or the
   happiness of those that are dearest to us, and part of ourselves, we
   must "fear God, and keep his commandments."

   And thus I have briefly represented to you some of the chief benefits
   and advantages which a holy and virtuous life does commonly bring to
   men in this world, which is the first encouragement mentioned in the
   text; "Ye have your fruit unto holiness."

   Before I proceed to the second, I shall only just lake notice, by way
   of application of what has been said on this argument,

   1. That it is a great encouragement to well-doing, to consider that
   ordinarily piety and goodness are no hinderance to a man's temporal
   felicity, but very frequently great promoters of it; so that, excepting
   only the case of persecution for religion, I think I may safely
   challenge any man to shew me how the practice of any part or duty of
   religion, how the exercise of any grace or virtue, is to the prejudice
   of a man's temporal interest, or does debar him of any true pleasure,
   or hinder him of any real advantage, which a prudent and considerate
   man would think fit to choose. And as for persecution and sufferings
   for religion, God can reward us for them, if he please, in this world;
   and we have all the assurance that we can desire, that he will do it
   abundantly in the next.

   2. The hope of long life, and especially of a quiet and comfortable
   death, should be a great encouragement to a holy and virtuous life. He
   that lives well, takes the best course to live long, and lays in for a
   happy old age, free from the diseases and infirmities which are
   naturally procured by a vicious youth, and likewise free from the guilt
   and galling remembrance of a wicked life. And there is no condition
   which we can fall into in this world, that does so clearly discover the
   difference between a good and bad man, as a death-bed: for then the
   good man begins most sensibly to enjoy the comforts of well doing, and
   the sinner to taste the bitter fruits of sin. What a wide difference is
   then to be seen between the hopes and fears of these two sorts of
   persons! and surely, next to the actual possession of blessedness, the
   good hopes and comfortable prospect of it are the greatest happiness;
   and next to actual sense of pain, the fear of suffering is the greatest
   torment.

   Though there were nothing beyond this life to be expected, yet if men
   were sure to be possessed with these delightful or troublesome passions
   when they come to die, no man that wisely considers things would, for
   all the pleasures of sin, forfeit the comfort of a righteous soul
   leaving this world full of the hope of immortality; and endure the
   vexation and anguish of a guilty conscience, and that infinite terror
   and amazement which so frequently possesseth the soul of a dying
   sinner.

   3. If there be any spark of a generous mind in us, it should animate us
   to do well, that we may be well spoken of when we are gone off the
   stage, and may transmit a grateful memory of our lives to those that
   shall be after us. I proceed now to the

   Second thing I proposed, as the great advantage indeed; viz. The
   glorious reward of a holy and virtuous life in another world, which is
   here called "everlasting life"--"and the end everlasting life;" by
   which the apostle intends to express to us, both the happiness of our
   future state, and the way and means whereby we are prepared and made
   meet to be made partakers of it; and that is by the constant and
   sincere endeavours of a holy and good life. For it is they only that
   "have their fruit unto holiness," whose end shall be "everlasting
   life." I shall speak briefly to these two, and so conclude my discourse
   upon this text.

   I. The happiness of our future state, which is here expressed by the
   name of "everlasting life," in very few words, but such as are of
   wonderful weight and significancy: for they import the excellency of
   this state, and the eternity of it. And who is sufficient to speak to
   either of these arguments? both of them are too big to enter now into
   the heart of man, too vast and boundless to be comprehended by human
   understanding, and too unwieldy to be managed by the tongue of men and
   angels, answer able to the unspeakable greatness and glory of them. And
   if I were able to declare them unto you, as they deserved, you would
   not be able to hear me. And therefore I shall choose to say but little
   upon an argument of which I can never say enough, and shall very
   briefly consider those two things which are comprehended in that short
   description which the text gives us of our future happiness, by the
   name of "everlasting life;" viz. The excellency of this state, and the
   eternity of it.

   1. The excellency of it, which is here represented to us under the
   notion of life, the most desirable of all other things, because it is
   the foundation of all other enjoyments whatsoever. Barely to be in
   being, and to be sensible that we are so, is but a dry notion of life.
   The true notion of life is to be well and to be happy, vivere est bene
   valere. They who are in the most miserable condition that can be
   imagined are in being, and sensible also that they are miserable. But
   this kind of life is so far from coming under the true notion of life,
   that the Scripture calls it "the second death." (Rev. xxi. 8.) It is
   there said, that "the wicked shall have their part in the lake that
   burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death." And,
   (chap. xx. 6.) "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
   resurrection; on such the second death shall have no power." So that a
   state of mere misery and torment is not life but death; nay, the
   Scripture will not allow the life of a wicked man in this world to be
   true life, but speaks of him as dead: (Ephes. ii. 1.) speaking of the
   sinners among the gentiles, "You (saith the apostle) hath he quickened,
   who were dead in trespasses and sins." And, which is more yet, the
   Scripture calls a life of sinful pleasures (which men esteem the only
   happiness of this world), the Scripture, I say, calls this a death. (1
   Tim. v. 6.) "She that liveth in pleasure, is dead whilst she liveth." A
   lewd and unprofitable life, which serves to no good end and purpose, is
   a death rather than a life. Nay, that decaying and dying life which we
   now live in this world, and which is allayed by the mixture of so many
   infirmities and pains, of so much trouble and sorrow, I say, that even
   this sort of life, for all that we are so fondly in love with it, does
   hardly deserve the name of life. But the life of the world to come, of
   which we now speak, this is life indeed; to do those things which we
   were made for, to serve the true ends of our being, and to enjoy the
   comfort and reward of so doing, this is the true notion of life; and
   whatever is less than this, is death, or a degree of it, and approach
   towards it. And therefore very well may heaven and happiness be
   described by the notion of life, because truly to live and to be happy
   are words that signify the same thing.

   But what kind of life this is, I can no more describe to you in the
   particularities of it, than Colum bus could have described the
   particular manners and customs of the people of America, before he or
   any other person in these parts of the world had seen it or been there.
   But this I can say of it in general, and that from the infallible
   testimony of the great Creator and glorious inhabitants of that blessed
   place, that it is a state of pure pleasure and unmingled joys, of
   pleasures more manly, more spiritual, and more refined, than any of the
   delights of sense, consisting in the enlargement of our minds and
   knowledge to a greater degree, and in the perfect exercise of love and
   friendship, in the conversation of the best and wisest company, free
   from self-interest, and all those unsociable passions of envy and
   jealousy, of malice and ill-will, which spoil the comfort of all
   conversation in this world; and, in a word, free from all other passion
   or design but an ardent and almost equal desire to contribute all, that
   by all means possible they can, to the mutual happiness of one another:
   for charity reigns in heaven, and is the brightest grace and virtue in
   the firmament of glory, far outshining all other; as St. Paul, who had
   himself been taken up into the third heaven, does expressly declare to
   us.

   Farther yet, this blessed state consists more particularly in these two
   things: in having our bodies raised and refined to a far greater purity
   and perfection than ever they had in this world; and in the consequent
   happiness of the whole man, soul and body, so strictly and firmly
   united as never to be parted again, and so equally matched as to be no
   trouble or impediment to one another.

   (1.) In having our bodies raised and refined to a greater purity and
   perfection than ever they had in this world. Our bodies, as they are
   now, are unequally tempered, and in a perpetual flux and change,
   continually tending to corruption, because made up of such contrary
   principles and qualities as by their perpetual conflict are always at
   work, conspiring the ruin and dissolution of them: but when they are
   raised again, they shall be so tempered and so refined, as to be free
   from all those destructive qualities which do now threaten their change
   and dissolution: and though they shall still consist of matter, yet
   they shall be purified to that degree, as to partake of the immortality
   of our souls, to which they shall be united, and to be of equal
   duration with them. So the Scripture tells us, (1 Cor. xv. 52, 53.)
   "That our dead bodies shall be raised incorruptible: for this
   corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
   immortality."

   Our bodies, when they are laid in the grave, are vile carcasses, but
   they shall be raised again beautiful and glorious, and as different
   from what they were before, as the heavenly mansions, in which they are
   to reside for ever, are from that dark cell of the grave out of which
   they are raised; and shall then be endowed with such a life, and
   strength, and vigour, as to be able, without any change or decay, to
   abide and continue for ever in the same state.

   Our bodies in this world are gross flesh and blood, liable to be
   affected with natural and sensual pleasures, and to be afflicted with
   natural pains and diseases; to be pressed with the natural necessities
   of hunger and thirst, and obnoxious to all those changes and accidents
   to which all natural things are subject: but "they shall be raised
   spiritual bodies," pure and refined from all the dregs of matter; they
   shall not hunger, nor thirst, nor be diseased, or in pain any more.

   "These houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust," are
   continually decaying; and, therefore, stand in need of continual
   reparation by food and physic: but "our house, which is from heaven"
   (as the apostle calls it) shall be of such lasting and durable
   materials, as not only time, but even eternity itself, shall make no
   impression upon it, or cause the least decay in it. "They (says our
   blessed Saviour) who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,
   and the resurrection from the dead, cannot die any more: but shall be
   like the angels, and are the children of God;" i. e. shall in some
   degree partake of the felicity and immortality of God himself, "who is
   always the same, and whose years fail not." Nay, the apostle expressly
   tells us, that our bodies after the resurrection shall be spiritual
   bodies, so that we shall then be as it were all spirit, and our bodies
   shall be so raised and refined, that they shall be no clog or
   impediment to the operation of our souls. And it must needs be a great
   comfort to us whilst we are in this world, to live in the hopes of so
   happy and glorious a change; when we consider how our bodies do now
   oppress our spirits, and what a melancholy and dead weight they are
   upon them, how grievous an incumbrance, and trouble, and temptation
   they are, for the most part, to us in this mortal state.

   (2.) The blessedness of this state consists, likewise, in the
   consequent happiness of the whole man, soul and body, so strictly and
   firmly united as never to be parted again, and so equally matched as to
   be no trouble and impediment to one another.

   In this world the soul and body are for the most part very unequally
   yoked, so that the soul is not only darkened by the gross fumes and
   clouds which rise from the body, but loaded and oppressed by the dull
   weight of it, which it very heavily lugs on and draws after it; and the
   soul, likewise, and the vicious inclinations, and the irregular
   passions of it, have many times an ill influence upon the body and the
   humours of it. But in the next world they shall both be purified, the
   one from sin, and the other from frailty and corruption, and both be
   admitted to the blessed sight and enjoyment of the ever-blessed God.

   But the consideration of this (as I said before) is too big for our
   narrow apprehensions in this mortal state, and an argument not fit to
   be treated of by such children as the wisest of men are in this world;
   and whenever we attempt to speak of it, we do but lisp like children,
   and understand like children, and reason like children about it; "That
   which is imperfect must be done away," and our souls must be raised to
   a greater perfection, and our understandings filled with a stronger and
   steadier light, before we can be fit to engage in so profound a
   contemplation. We must first have been in heaven, and possessed of that
   felicity and glory which is there to be enjoyed, before we can either
   speak or think of it in any measure as it deserves. In the meantime,
   whenever we set about it, we shall find our faculties oppressed and
   dazzled with the weight and splendour of so great and glorious an
   argument; like St. Paul, who, when he "was caught up into paradise,"
   saw and heard those things which, when he came down again into this
   world, he was not able to express, and which it was not possible for
   the tongue of man to utter.

   So that in discoursing of the state of the blessed, we must content
   ourselves with what the Scripture hath revealed in general concerning
   it; that it is a state of perfect freedom from all those infirmities
   and imperfections, those evils and miseries, those sins and temptations
   which we are liable to in this world. So St. John describes the glory
   and felicity of that state, as they were in visions represented to him:
   (Rev. xxi. 2-4.) "And I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
   prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice
   out of heaven, saying, Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and he
   will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself
   shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears
   from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
   crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are
   passed away:" that is, all those evils which we saw or suffered in this
   world, shall for ever vanish and disappear; and, which is the great
   privilege and felicity of all, that there shall no sin be there: (ver.
   27.) "There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth;
   and, consequently, there shall be no misery and curse there." So we
   read, (chap. xxii. 3, 4.) "And there shall be no more curse; but the
   throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall
   serve him, and they shall see his face." In which last words our
   employment and our happiness are expressed; but what in particular our
   employment shall be, and wherein it shall consist, is impossible now to
   describe; it is sufficient to know in the general, that our employment
   shall be our unspeakable pleasure, and every way suitable to the glory
   and happiness of that state, and as much above the noblest and most
   delightful employments of this world, as the perfection of embodies,
   and the powers of our souls, shall then be above what they are now in
   this world.

   For there is no doubt but that he who made us, and endued our souls
   with a desire of immortality, and so large a capacity of happiness,
   does understand very well by what way and means to make us happy, and
   hath in readiness proper exercises and employments for that state, and
   every way more fitted to make us happy, than any condition or
   employment in this world is suitable to a temporal happiness;
   employments that are suitable to "the spirits of just men made
   perfect," united to bodies purified and refined almost to the condition
   of spirits; employments which we shall be so far from being weary of,
   that they shall minister to us a new and fresh delight to all eternity;
   and this, perhaps, not so much from the variety, as from the perpetual
   and growing pleasure of them.

   It is sufficient for us to know this in the general, and to trust the
   infinite power, and wisdom, and goodness of God, for the particular
   manner and circum stances of our happiness: not doubting but that he,
   who is the eternal and inexhaustible spring and fountain of all
   happiness, can and will derive and convey such a share of it to every
   one of us as he thinks fit, and in such ways as he, who best under
   stands it, is best able to find out.

   In a word, the happiness of the next life shall be such as is worthy of
   the great King of the world to bestow upon his faithful servants, and
   such as is in finitely beyond the just reward of their best services;
   it is to see God, i. e. to contemplate and love the best and most
   perfect of beings, and "to be for ever with the Lord, in whose presence
   is fulness of joy, and at whose right hand there are pleasures for
   evermore,"

   J will say no more upon this argument, lest I should say less, and
   because whoever ventures to wade far into it will soon find himself out
   of his depth, and in danger to be swallowed up and lost in that great
   abyss, which is not to be fathomed by the shallow faculties of mortal
   men.

   I shall therefore only mention the

   2. Second thing I proposed to speak to; viz. the eternity of this
   happiness: "and the end everlasting life:" by which the apostle intends
   to express the utmost perfection, but not the final period, of the
   happiness of good men in another world. For to a perfect state of
   happiness these two conditions are requisite; that it be immutable, and
   that it be interminable, that it can neither admit of a change nor of
   an end. And this is all that I shall say of it, it being impossible to
   say any thing that is more intelligible and plain, concerning that
   which is infinite, than that it is so. I should now have proceeded to
   the

   II. Second thing I proposed; viz. By what way and means we may be
   prepared, and made meet to be made partakers of this happiness; and
   that is (as I have told yon all along) by the constant and sincere
   endeavour of a holy and good life; for the text supposeth that they
   only who are "made free from sin, and become the servants of God," and
   who "have their fruit unto holiness," are they whose end shall be
   everlasting life. But this is an argument which I have had so frequent
   occasion to speak to, that I shall not now meddle with it. All that I
   shall do more at present, shall be to make an inference or two from
   what hath been said upon this argument.

   I. The consideration of the happy state of good men in another world,
   cannot but be a great comfort and support to good men under all the
   evils and sufferings of this present life. Hope is a great cordial to
   the minds of men, especially when the thing hoped for does so vastly
   outweigh the present grievance and trouble. The Holy Scriptures, which
   reveal to us the happiness of our future state, do likewise assure us
   that there is no comparison between the afflictions and sufferings of
   good men in this world, and the reward of them in the other. "I reckon,
   (saith St. Paul, Rom. viii. 18.) that the sufferings of this present
   time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be
   revealed in us."

   Particularly the consideration of that glorious change which shall be
   made in our bodies at the resurrection, ought to be a great comfort to
   us under all the pains and diseases which they are now liable to, and
   even against death itself. One of the greatest burthens of human
   nature, is the frailty and infirmity of our bodies, the necessities
   which they are frequently pressed withal, the diseases and pains to
   which they are liable, and the fear of death, by reason whereof a great
   part of mankind are subject to bondage; against all which this is an
   everlasting spring of consolation to us, that the time is coming when
   we shall have other sort of bodies, freed from that burthen of
   corruption which we now groan under, and from all those miseries and
   inconveniencies which flesh and blood are now subject to. For the time
   will come, when "these vile bodies," which we now wear, "shall be
   changed, and fashioned like to the glorious body of the Son of God;"
   and when they shall be raised at the last day, they shall not be raised
   such as we laid them down, vile and corruptible, but immortal and
   incorruptible: for the same power which hath raised them up to life,
   shall likewise change them, and put a glory upon them like to that of
   the glorified body of our Lord; and when this glorious change is made,
   "when this corruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortal hath
   put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written,
   Death is swallowed up in victory;" and when this last enemy is
   perfectly subdued, we shall be set above all the frailties and dangers,
   all the temptations and sufferings of this mortal state; there will be
   then no fleshly lusts and brutish passions to war against the soul; no
   law in our members to rise up in rebellion against the law of our
   minds; no diseases to torment us, no danger of death to terrify us; all
   the motions and passions of our outward man shall then be perfectly
   subject to the reason of our minds, and our bodies shall partake of the
   immortality of our souls. How should this consideration bear us up
   under all the evils of life and the fears of death, that the
   resurrection will be a perfect cure of all our infirmities and
   diseases, and an effectual remedy of all the evils that we now labour
   under; and that it is but a very little while that we shall be troubled
   with these frail, and mortal, and vile bodies, which shall shortly be
   laid in the dust, and when they are raised again, shall become
   spiritual, incorruptible, and glorious.

   And if our bodies shall undergo so happy a change, what happiness may
   we imagine shall then be conferred upon our souls, that so much better
   and nobler part of ourselves! as the apostle reasons in another case,
   "Doth God take care of oxen?" Hath he this consideration of our bodies,
   which are but the brutish part of the man? what regard will he then
   have to his own image, that spark of divinity which is for ever to
   reside in these bodies? If, upon the account of our souls, and for
   their sakes, our bodies shall become incorruptible, spiritual, and
   glorious, then certainly our souls shall be endued with far more
   excellent and Divine qualities: if our bodies shall, in some degree,
   partake of the perfection of our souls in their spiritual and immortal
   nature, to what a pitch of perfection shall our souls be raised and
   advanced! even to an equality with angels, and to some kind of
   participation of the Divine nature and perfection, so far as a creature
   is capable of them.

   II. The comparison which is here in the text, and which I have largely
   explained, between the manifest inconveniences of a sinful and vicious
   course, and the manifold advantages of a holy and virtuous life, is a
   plain direction to us which of these two to choose. So that I may make
   the same appeal that Moses does, after that he had at large declared
   the blessings promised to the obedience of God's laws, and the curse
   denounced against the violation and transgression of them: (Deut. xxx.
   19.) "I call heaven and earth to record against you this day, that I
   have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore
   choose life," that you may be happy in life and death, and after death
   to all eternity. I know every one is ready to choose happiness, and to
   say with Balaam, "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my
   latter end be like his:" but if we do in good earnest desire the end,
   we must take the way that leads to it; we must "become the servants of
   God," and "have our fruit unto holiness," if ever we expect that "the
   end shall be everlasting life."

  THE NATURE AND NECESSITY OF HOLY RESOLUTION.

   Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I
   will not offend any more: that which I see not, teach thou me; if I
   have done iniquity, I will do no more.--Job xxxiv. 31, 32.

   THESE words are the words of Elihu, one of Job's friends, and the only
   one who is not reproved for his discourse with Job, and who was,
   probably, the author of this ancient and most eloquent history of the
   sufferings and patience of Job, and of the end which the Lord made with
   him; and they contain in them a description of the temper and behaviour
   of a true penitent. "Surely it is meet," &c.

   In which words we have the two essential parts of a true repentance.

   First, A humble acknowledgment and confession of our sins to God;
   "Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement."

   Secondly, A firm purpose and resolution of amendment and forsaking of
   sin for the future; "I will not offend any more: if I have done
   iniquity, I will do no more."

   First, A humble acknowledgment and confession of our sins to God:
   "Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement;"
   that is, have sinned and been justly punished for it, and am now
   convinced of the evil of sin, and resolved to leave it; "I have borne
   chastisement, I will offend no more."

   Of this first part of repentance, viz. a humble confession of our sins
   to God, with great shame and sorrow for them, and a thorough conviction
   of the evil and danger of a sinful course, I have already treated at
   large. In these repentance must begin, but it must not end in them: for
   a penitent confession of our sins to God, and a conviction of the evil
   of them, signifies nothing, unless it brings us to a resolution of
   amendment; that is, of leaving our sins, and betaking ourselves to a
   better course. And this I intend, by God's assistance, to speak to now,
   as being the

   Second part of a true repentance here described in the text; viz. a
   firm purpose and resolution of amendment, and forsaking of sin for the
   future; and to express it the more strongly and emphatically, and to
   shew the firmness of the resolution, it is repeated again, "I will not
   offend any more;" and then in the next verse, "If I have done iniquity,
   I will do no more." And this is so necessary a part of repentance, that
   herein the very essence and formal nature of repentance does consist;
   viz. in the firm and sincere purpose and resolution of a better course.

   In the handling of this argument, I shall do these six things:

   I. I shall shew what resolution is in general.

   II. What is the special object of this kind of resolution.

   III. What is implied in a sincere resolution of leaving our sins, and
   returning to God.

   IV. I shall shew that in this resolution of amendment, the very essence
   and formal nature of repentance does consist.

   V. I shall offer some considerations to convince men both of the
   necessity and fitness of this resolution, and of keeping steadfastly to
   it. "Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I will not offend any
   more."

   VI. I shall add some brief directions concerning the managing and
   maintaining of this holy and necessary resolution.

   I. What resolution in general is. It is a fixed determination of the
   will about any thing, either to do it, or not to do it, as upon due
   deliberation we have judged and concluded it to be necessary or
   convenient to be done, or not to be done by us: and this supposeth
   three things.

   1. Resolution supposeth a precedent deliberation of the mind about the
   thing to be resolved upon. For no prudent man does determine or resolve
   upon any thing till he hath considered the thing, and weighed it well
   with himself, and hath fully debated the necessity and expedience of
   it; what advantage he shall have by the doing of it, and what danger
   and inconvenience will certainly, or very probably, redound to him by
   the neglect and omission of it. For peremptorily to determine and
   resolve upon any thing before a man hath done this, is not properly
   resolution, but precipitancy and rashness.

   2. Resolution supposeth some judgment passed upon the thing, after a
   man hath thus deliberated about it: that he is satisfied in his mind
   one way or other concerning it, that his understanding is convinced
   either that it is necessary and convenient for him to do it, or that it
   is not; and this is sometimes called resolution, but is not that
   resolution which immediately determines a man to action. This judgment
   of the necessity and fitness of the thing, is not the resolution of the
   will, but of the understanding: for it does not signify that a man hath
   fully deter mined to do the thing, but that he hath determined with
   himself that it is reasonable to be done, and that he is no longer in
   doubt and suspense whether it be best for him to do it or not, but is
   in his mind resolved and satisfied one way or other. And these are two
   very different things; to be resolved in one's judgment, that is, to be
   convinced that a thing is fit and necessary to be done, and to be
   resolved to set upon the doing of it; for many men are thus convinced
   of the fitness and necessity of the thing, who yet have not the heart,
   cannot bring themselves to a firm and fixed resolution to set upon the
   doing of it. So that an act of the judgment must go before the
   resolution of the will: for as he is rash that resolves to do a thing
   before he hath deliberated about it; so he is blind and wilful that
   resolves to do a thing before his judgment be satisfied, whether it be
   best for him to do it or not.

   3. If the matter be of considerable moment and consequence, resolution
   supposeth some motion of the affections; which is a kind of bias upon
   the will, a certain propension and inclination that a man feels in
   himself, either urging him to do a thing, or withdrawing him from it.
   Deliberation and judgment, they direct a man what to do, or leave
   undone; the affections excite and quicken a man to take some resolution
   in the matter; that is, to do suitably to the judgment his mind hath
   passed upon the thing. For instance; a great sinner reflects upon his
   life, and considers what he hath done, what the course is that he lives
   in, and what the issue and consequence of it will probably or certainly
   be, whether it will make him happy or miserable in the conclusion; and
   debating the matter calmly and soberly with himself, he is satisfied
   and convinced of the evil and danger of a wicked life, and consequently
   that it is best for him to resolve upon a better course; that is, to
   repent. Now these thoughts must needs awaken in him fearful
   apprehensions of the wrath of Almighty God, which is due to him for his
   sins, and hangs over him, and which he is every moment in danger of, if
   he goes on in his evil course. These thoughts are apt, likewise, to
   fill him with shame and confusion, at the remembrance of his horrible
   ingratitude to God his maker, his best friend and greatest benefactor,
   and of his desperate folly in provoking omnipotent justice against
   himself; whereupon he is heartily grieved and troubled for what he hath
   done; and these affections of fear, and shame, and sorrow, being once
   up, they come with great violence upon the will, and urge the man to a
   speedy resolution of changing his course, and leaving the way he is in,
   which he is fully convinced is so evil and dangerous; and of betaking
   himself to another course, which he is fully satisfied will be much
   more for his safety and advantage.

   So that resolution, in general, is a fixed determination of the will;
   that is, such a determination as is not only for the present free from
   all wavering and doubting, but such as cannot prudently be altered, so
   long as reason remains. For the man who, upon full deliberation and
   conviction of his mind, resolves upon any thing, cannot without the
   imputation of fickleness and inconstancy quit that resolution, so long
   as he hath the same reason which he had when he took it up, and is
   still satisfied that the reason is good. For instance; the man who hath
   taken up a resolution to be sober, because of the ugliness and
   unreasonableness of drunkenness, and the temporal inconveniencies, and
   eternal damnation, which that sin exposeth a man to; if these reasons
   be true and good, can never prudently alter the resolution which he
   hath taken, and return to that sin again.

   II. Let us consider what is the special object or matter of this
   resolution, wherein the formal nature of repentance does consist, what
   it is that a man when he repents resolves upon; and that I told you is
   to leave his sin, and to return to God and his duty; and this is the
   resolution which the penitent here described in the text takes up, "I
   will not offend any more. That which I see not, teach thou me; and if I
   have done iniquity, I will do no more." He resolves against all known
   sin, "I will not offend any more;" and if through ignorance he had
   sinned, and done contrary to his duty, he desires to be better
   instructed, that he may not offend again in the like kind. "That which
   I see not, teach thou me; and if I have done iniquity, I will do no
   more."

   So that the true penitent resolves upon these two things:

   1. To forsake his sin. And,

   2. To return to God and his duty.

   1. To forsake his sin: and this implies the quit ting of his sinful
   course whatever it had been; and that not only by abstaining from the
   outward act and practice of every sin, but by endeavouring to crucify
   and subdue the inward affection and inclination to it.

   And it implies farther, the utter forsaking of sin; for repentance is
   not only a resolution to abstain from sin for the present, but never to
   return to it again. Thus Ephraim, when he repented of his idolatry, he
   utterly renounced it, saying, "What have I to do any more with idols?"
   (Hos. xiv. 8.) He that truly repents, is resolved to break off his
   sinful course, and to abandon those lusts and vices which he was
   formerly addicted to, and lived in.

   2. The true penitent resolves likewise to return to God and his duty;
   he does not stay in the negative part of religion, he does not only
   resolve not to commit any sin, but not to neglect or omit any thing
   that he knows to be his duty; and if he has been ignorant of any part
   of his duty, he is willing to know it, that he may do it; he is not
   only deter mined to forsake his sin, which will make him miserable, but
   to return to God, who alone can make him happy: he is now resolved to
   love God, and to serve him as much as he hated and dishonoured him
   before; and will now be as diligent to perform and practise all the
   duties and parts of religion, as he was negligent of them before, and
   as ready to do all the good he can to all men in any kind, as he was
   careless of these things before: these, in general, are the things
   which a true penitent resolves upon. I proceed to the

   III. Third thing I proposed to consider; namely, what is implied in a
   sincere resolution of leaving our sins, and returning to God and our
   duty. And this holy resolution, if it be thorough and sincere, does
   imply in it these three things:

   1. That it be universal.

   2. That it be a resolution of the means as well as of the end.

   3. That it presently comes to effect, and be speedily and without delay
   put in execution.

   1. A sincere resolution of amendment must be universal: a resolution to
   forsake all sin, and to return to our whole duty, and every part of it;
   such a resolution as that of holy David, "to hate every false way, and
   to have respect to all God's commandments."

   This resolution must be universal, in respect of the whole man; and
   with regard to all our actions. In respect of the whole man; for we
   must resolve not only to abstain from the outward action of sin, but
   this resolution must have its effect upon our inward man, and reach our
   very hearts and thoughts; it must restrain our inclinations, and
   "mortify our lusts and corrupt affections," and "renew us in the very
   spirit of our minds," as the apostle expresses it.

   And it must be universal, in respect of all our actions. For this is
   not the resolution of a sincere penitent, to abstain only from gross
   and notorious, from scandalous and open sins; but, likewise, to refrain
   from the commission of those sins which are small in the esteem of men,
   and not branded with a mark of public infamy and reproach; to forbear
   sin in secret, and when no eye of man sees us and takes notice of us.
   This is not a sincere resolution, to resolve to practise the duties and
   virtues of religion in public, and to neglect them in private; to
   resolve to perform the duties of the first table, and to pass by those
   of the second; to resolve to serve God, and to take a liberty to
   defraud and cozen men; to honour our Father which is in heaven, and to
   injure and hate our brethren upon earth; "to love our neighbour, and to
   hate our enemy," as the Jews did of old time; to resolve against
   swearing, and to al low ourselves the liberty to speak falsely, and to
   break our word; to free from superstition, and to run into faction; "to
   abhor idols, and to commit sacrilege;" to resolve to be devout at
   church, and deceitful in our shops; to he very scrupulous about lesser
   matters, and to be very zealous about indifferent things; "to tithe
   mint, and anise, and cummin, and to omit the weightier matters of the
   law, mercy, and fidelity, and justice;" to be very rigid in matters of
   faith and opinion, but loose in life and practice.

   No; the resolution of a sincere penitent must be universal and uniform;
   it must extend alike to the forbearing of all sin, and the exercise of
   every grace and virtue, and to the due practice and performance of
   every part of our duty. The true penitent must resolve for the future
   to abstain from all sin, "to be holy in all manner of conversation, and
   to abound in all the fruits of righteousness, which, by Jesus Christ,
   are to the praise and glory of God." For, if a man do truly repent of
   his wicked life, there is the very same reason why he should resolve
   against all sin, as why he should resolve against any; why he should
   observe all the commandments of God, as why he should keep any one of
   them. For, as St. James reasons concerning him that wilfully breaks any
   one commandment of God, that "he is guilty of all, and breaks the whole
   law;" because the authority of God is equally stamped upon all his
   laws, and is violated and contemned by the wilful transgression of any
   one of them; "For he that hath said, Thou shalt not kill, hath likewise
   said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, and, Thou shalt not steal:" so he
   that resolves against any one sin, or upon performance of any one part
   of his duty, ought for the very same reason to make his resolution
   universal; because one sin is evil and provoking to God, as well as
   another, and the performance of one part of our duty good and pleasing
   to him, as well as another, and there is no difference. So that he that
   resolves against any sin, upon wise and reasonable grounds, because of
   the evil of it, and the danger of the wrath of God to which it exposeth
   us, ought for the same reason to resolve against all sin; because it is
   damnable to commit adultery, and to steal, as well as to kill; and that
   resolution against sin, which is not universal, it is a plain case that
   it is not true and sincere, and that it was not taken up out of the
   sense of the intrinsical evil of sin, and the danger of it in respect
   of God and the judgment of another world (for this reason holds against
   every sin, and remains always the same), but that it was taken up upon
   some inferior consideration, either because of the shame and infamy of
   it among men, or because of some other temporal inconvenience, which if
   the man could be secured against, he would presently break his
   resolution, and return to the commission of that sin with as much
   freedom as any other.

   2. A sincere resolution implies a resolution of the means as well as of
   the end. He that is truly and honestly resolved against any sin, is
   likewise resolved to avoid, as much as is possible, the occasions and
   temptations which may lead or draw him to that sin; or if they happen
   to present themselves to him, he is resolved to stand upon his guard,
   and to resist them. In like manner, he that sincerely resolves upon
   doing his duty in any kind, must resolve upon the means that are
   requisite and necessary to the due discharge and performance of that
   duty. As he that resolves against that needless and useless sin of
   swearing in common conversation, must resolve also "to set a guard
   before the door of his lips," seeing it is certain that it requires
   great care and attention, at least for some competent time, to get rid
   of a habit.

   When David resolved not to offend with his tongue, he resolved at the
   same time to be very watchful over himself; (Psal. xxxix. 1.) "I said,
   I will take heed to my ways, that I offend not with my tongue: I will
   keep my mouth as with a bridle, while the wicked is before me." For a
   man to resolve against any sin or vice, and yet to involve himself
   continually in the occasions, and to run himself into the company and
   temptations which do naturally, and will almost necessarily, lead and
   betray him into those sins, is a plain evidence of insincerity. This I
   take for a certain rule; that whatever can reasonably move a man to
   resolve upon any end, will, if his resolution be sincere and honest,
   determine him every whit as strongly to use all those means which are
   necessary in order to that end. But of this I have spoken elsewhere.

   3. A sincere resolution of leaving our sins, and returning to God and
   our duty, does imply the present time, and that we are to resolve
   speedily and without delay to put this resolution in practice; that we
   are peremptorily determined not to go one step farther in the ways of
   sin, not to neglect any duty that God requires of us not for one
   moment; but immediately and forthwith to set upon the practice of it,
   so soon as occasion and opportunity is offered to us. And the reason of
   this is evident; because the very same considerations that prevail upon
   any man to take up this resolution of amendment, and changing the
   course of his life, are every whit as prevalent to engage him to put
   this resolution presently in practice and execution.

   I deny not, but a man may resolve upon a thing for the future, and when
   the time comes may execute his resolution, and this resolution may for
   all that be very sincere and real, though it was delayed to a certain
   time, because he did not see reason to resolve to do the thing sooner:
   but it can not be so in this case of repentance; because there can no
   good reason be imagined, why a man should resolve seven years hence to
   change his course, and break off his sinful life, but the very same
   reason will hold as strongly, why he should do it presently and without
   delay; and over and besides this, there are a great many and powerful
   reasons and considerations why he should rather put this good
   resolution in present execution, than put it off and defer it to any
   farther time what soever.

   What is it that puts thee upon this resolution of leaving thy sins, and
   urgeth thee to do it at all? Art thou resolved to leave sin because it
   is so great an evil? Why, it is so for the present; the evil of it is
   intrinsical to it, and cleaves to the very nature of it, and is never
   to be separated from it; so that this is a present reason, and as
   strong against it now, as ever it will be hereafter: nay, it is
   stronger at present; because, if it be so great an evil, the sooner we
   leave it the better.

   Or dost thou resolve to forsake sin, because thou art apprehensive of
   the danger and mischief of it, that it will expose thee to the wrath of
   God, and to the endless and intolerable misery of another world? Why
   this reason likewise makes much more for the present leaving of it;
   because the longer thou continuest in a sinful and impenitent state,
   the greater is thy danger, and the greater penalty thou wilt most
   certainly incur; by delaying to put this good resolution in practice,
   thou dost increase and multi ply the causes of thy fear. For hereby
   thou provokest God more, and every day dost incense his wrath more and
   more against thee; thou preparest more and more fuel for everlasting
   burnings, and treasurest up for thyself more wrath, "against the day of
   wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God." Nay, thou
   dost not only in crease and aggravate, but thou dost hereby hasten
   thine own misery and ruin, and takest the most effectual course that is
   possible, to bring thine own fears and the vengeance of Almighty God so
   much the sooner upon thee. For nothing provokes God to take a speedier
   course with sinners, and does more quicken the pace of his judgments,
   than wilful continuance in sin.

   And yet farther: if thy resolution be valuable and considerable to
   thee, thou takest the most effectual course in the world to frustrate
   and defeat it. Thou art fully resolved to leave thy sins hereafter, and
   thou thinkest thou hast reason for it: but by continuing in them for
   the present, thou provokest the justice of Almighty God to cut thee off
   before thy resolution has taken effect.

   Again: dost thou resolve to leave thy sins one time or other, because
   thereby thou hopest to put thyself into a capacity of pardon and mercy,
   and of eternal life and happiness? Why this reason should move thee to
   do the thing as soon as is possible, because the sooner thou forsakest
   thy sins, thou hast the greater hope of finding mercy and forgiveness
   with God; and the sooner thou beginnest a holy course, and the longer
   thou continuest therein, thou hast reason to expect a greater and more
   ample reward. Thou canst not, by holding off, hope to bring down pardon
   and mercy to lower rates, and to obtain these hereafter upon easier
   terms. No: the terms and conditions of God's mercy are already fixed
   and established, so as never to be altered.

   So that whatever reason thou canst possibly allege for taking up this
   resolution, it is every whit as forcible and powerful to persuade thee
   to put it speedily in execution.

   And then there is this reason besides, and that a very considerable
   one, why thou shouldest immediately put this resolution in practice,
   and not delay it for a moment. Thou mayest at present do it much more
   certainly, and much more easily. Much more certainly, because thou art
   surer of the present time than thou canst be of the future. The present
   is in thy power, but not one moment more. And thou mayest at present do
   it more easily; for the longer thou continuest in sin, thy resolution
   against it will still grow weaker, and the habit of sin continually
   stronger. Thou wilt every day be more enslaved by the power of thy
   lusts, and thy heart will every day be more hardened through the
   deceitfulness of sin. All the change that time makes will still be for
   the worse, and more to thy disadvantage. Sin will be as pleasant to
   thee hereafter, and thou more loath to leave it, than at present. Sin
   was never mortified by age. It will every day have more strength to
   bind thee and hold thee fast, and thou wilt have every day less to
   break loose from it. For by every sin thou dost commit, thou addest a
   new degree to the strength and force of it; and so much strength as
   thou addest to it, so much thou takest from thyself, and so much thou
   losest of thine own power and liberty. For a man and his lusts are like
   nature and a disease; so much strength as the disease gains, nature
   loseth, and the man is hereby doubly weakened, for he doth not only
   lose so much of his own strength, but the enemy gets it.

   Nay, thou dost hereby likewise forfeit that auxiliary strength and
   assistance which the grace of God is ready to afford to men, his
   restraining and his preventing grace. For as a man goes on in sin, and
   advanceth in an evil course, the grace of God draws off by degrees, and
   his Holy Spirit doth in sensibly leave him; and when a sinner is come
   to this, his best resolutions will "vanish like the morning cloud, and
   the early dew which passeth away."

   So that it cannot be a true and sincere resolution of leaving our sins,
   if it do not take place, and have not its effect, presently. For there
   is no man that takes up a resolution, upon weighty and consider able
   reasons, of doing any thing, but, if the reasons upon which he takes it
   up urge him to do the thing at present, he will presently set about it;
   and that man is not resolved to do a thing, whatever he may pretend,
   who hath most reason to it at present, and may best do it now, and yet
   delays it.

   And thus I have opened to you the nature of this holy resolution of
   leaving our sins, and returning to God and our duty, and have shewn
   what is necessarily implied in such a resolution, if it be sincere and
   in good earnest; that it be universal; and that it be a resolution of
   the means as well as of the end; and that it presently take place and
   be put in execution. And these are three of the best signs and marks
   that I know of, whereby a man may try and examine the truth and
   sincerity of that resolution of amendment which we call repentance. If
   it be against all sin, and have an equal regard to every part of our
   duty; if, when we resolve upon the end, that is, to avoid sin, and to
   perform our duty, we are equally resolved upon the means that are
   necessary to those ends; if the resolution we have taken up commence
   presently, and from that day forward be duly executed and put in
   practice; then is our repentance and resolution of amendment sincere:
   but if there be a defect in any of these, our resolution is not as it
   ought to be.

SERMON CLXVII.

  THE NATURE AND NECESSITY OF HOLY RESOLUTION.

   Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I
   will not offend any more: that which I see not, teach thou me; if I
   have done iniquity, I will do no more.--Job xxxiv. 31, 32.

   THESE words are the description of the temper and behaviour of a true
   penitent, and do contain in them the two essential parts of a true
   repentance.

   First, A humble acknowledgment and confession of sin.

   Secondly, A firm purpose and resolution of amendment, and forsaking our
   sins for the future.

   And this latter is so necessary a part of repentance, that herein the
   very essence and formal nature of repentance does consist. In handling
   of this argument, I proposed to consider,

   I. What resolution in general is.

   II. What is the special object or matter of this kind of resolution.

   III. What is implied in a sincere resolution of leaving our sins, and
   returning to God and our duty.

   IV. To shew that, in this resolution of amendment, the very essence and
   formal nature of repentance doth consist.

   V. To offer some considerations to convince men of the necessity and
   fitness of this resolution, and of keeping steadfast to it.

   VI. To add some directions concerning the managing and maintaining this
   holy resolution. The three first I have spoken to; I now proceed to the

   IV. Fourth, To shew that in this resolution the very essence and formal
   nature of repentance doth consist. A man may do many reasonable actions
   without an explicit resolution. In things that are more easy and
   natural to us, judgment and resolution are all one; it is all one to
   judge a thing fit to be done, and to resolve to do it. But in matters
   of difficulty, when a man is to strive against the stream, and to
   oppose strong habits that have taken deep root, there is nothing to be
   done without an explicit resolution. No man makes any remarkable change
   in his life, so as to cross his inclinations and custom, without an
   express resolution. For though a man's judgment be never so much
   convinced of the reasonableness and necessity of such a change; yet,
   unless a man's spirit be fortified and fixed by resolution, the power
   of custom, and the violence of his own inclinations, will carry him
   against his judgment. Now there is no change of a man's life can be
   imagined, wherein a man offers greater violence to inveterate habits,
   and to the strong propensions of his present temper, than in this of
   repentance. So that among all the actions of a man's life, there is
   none that doth more necessarily require an express purpose than
   repentance does.

   And that herein repentance doth chiefly consist, I shall endeavour to
   make evident from Scripture, and from the common apprehensions of
   mankind concerning repentance.

   The Scripture, besides the several descriptions of repentance, useth
   two words to express it to us, metame'leia and meta'noia. The former
   properly signifies the inward trouble and displeasure which men
   conceive against themselves for having done amiss; which if it be kata`
   Theo`n lu'pe, "a godly sorrow," it worketh in us meta'noian
   ametame'leton, as St. Paul calls it, "a repentance not to be repented
   of;" that is, such a change of our minds, which as we shall have no
   cause to be troubled at, so no reason to alter afterwards. And what is
   this but a firm, steadfast, and unalterable resolution?

   The Scripture likewise useth several phrases of the like importance to
   describe repentance by; as, forsaking and turning from sin, and
   conversion and turning to God. Forsaking and turning from sin: hence it
   is called, "Repentance from dead works," (Heb. vi. 1.) and turning to
   God, (Acts xxvi. 20.) "I have shewed to the gentiles that they shall
   repent and turn to God;" that is, from the worship of idols to the true
   God. And we have both these together in the description which the
   prophet gives of repentance: (Isa. lv. 7.) "Let the wicked forsake his
   ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the
   Lord." Now this change begins in the sinner's resolution of doing this;
   and the unrighteous man's forsaking his thoughts, is no thing else but
   changing the purpose of his mind, and resolving upon a better course.
   And thus Lactantius describes it: Agere autem poenitentiam nihil aliud
   est, quam affirmare et profiteri se non amplius peccaturum: "To repent,
   is nothing else but for a man to declare and profess that he will sin
   no more." This is repentance before men. And repentance before God is a
   resolution answerable to this profession. And elsewhere, saith the same
   author, "The Greeks do most fully express repentance by the word
   meta'noia, because he that repents recovers his mind from his former
   folly, and is troubled at it:" et confirmat animam suam ad rectius
   vivendum, "and confirms his mind for a better course." And how is this
   done but by a resolution? And that this is the natural and true notion
   of repentance, appears, in that the heathens did consent and agree in
   it. Gellius gives this description of it: Poenitere tum dicere solemus,
   cum quæ ipsi fecimus, ea nobis post incipiunt displicere, sententiamque
   in iis nostram demutamus: "We are said then to repent, when those
   things which we have done be gin afterwards to displease us, and we
   change our resolution about them." And so, likewise, one of the
   philosophers describes it: "Repentance is the beginning of philosophy,
   a flying from foolish words and actions, kai` tes ametamele'tou zoes e
   pro'te paraskeue`, and the first preparation of a life not to be
   repented of."

   It is true, indeed, repentance supposeth the entire change of our lives
   and actions, and a continued state, as the proper consequence of it:
   but repentance is but the beginning of this change, which takes its
   rise from the purpose and resolution of our minds; and if it be sincere
   and firm, it will certainly have this effect, to change our lives; and
   if it be not so, it is not repentance. For though in the nature of the
   thing it be possible that a man may sincerely resolve upon a thing, and
   yet let fall his resolution afterwards, before it come into act; yet,
   in the phrase of Scripture, nothing is called repentance but such a
   resolution as takes effect, so soon as there is opportunity for it. If
   we change our resolution, and repent of our repentance, this is not
   that which St. Paul calls "Repentance unto salvation." So that no man
   that reads and considers the Bible, can impose upon himself so grossly,
   as to conceit himself a true penitent, and, consequently, to be in a
   state of salvation, who hath been troubled for his sins, and hath taken
   up a resolution to leave them, if he do not pursue this resolution, and
   act according to it.

   V. I shall, in the next place, propound some arguments and
   considerations to persuade men to this holy resolution, and then to
   keep them firm and steadfast to it, so as never to change it after they
   have once taken it up.

   First, I shall propound some arguments to persuade men to take up this
   resolution; and they are these:

   1. Consider that this resolution of repentance is nothing but what,
   under the influence of God's grace and Holy Spirit, which are never
   wanting to the sincere endeavours of men, is in your power. And it is
   necessary to premise this; for unless this be cleared, all the other
   arguments that I can use will signify nothing. For nothing in the world
   could be more vain, than to take a great deal of pains to persuade men
   to do a thing which they cannot do, to entreat them to attempt an
   impossibility, and to urge and solicit them with all earnestness and
   importunity to do that which is absolutely and altogether out of their
   power. All the commands of God, and the exhortations of his word, and
   all the promises and threatenings whereby these commands and
   exhortations are enforced, do plainly suppose, either that it is in our
   power to do the thing which God commands or exhorts us to; or else, if
   it be not (which I grant it is not), that God is ready by his grace and
   strength, if we be not wanting to ourselves, to assist and enable us to
   those ends and purposes. For the gospel supposeth a power going along
   with it, and that the Holy Spirit of God works upon the minds of men,
   to quicken, and excite, and assist them to their duty. And if it were
   not so, the exhortations of preachers would be nothing else but a cruel
   and bitter mocking of sinners, and an ironical insulting over the
   misery and weakness of poor creatures; and for ministers to preach, or
   people to hear sermons, upon other terms, would be the vainest expense
   of time, and the idlest thing we do all the week; and all our
   dissuasives from sin, and exhortations to holiness and a good life, and
   vehement persuasions of men to strive to get to heaven, and to escape
   hell, would be just as if one should urge a blind man, by many reasons
   and arguments, taken from the advantages of sight, and the comfort of
   that sense, and the beauty of external objects, by all means to open
   his eyes, and to behold the delights of nature, to see his way, and to
   look to his steps, and should upbraid him, and be very angry with him,
   for not doing so. Why, if resolution be absolutely impossible to us,
   and a thing wholly out of our power, it is just the same case. But then
   we ought to deal plainly and openly with men, and to tell them, that
   what we so earnestly persuade them to is that which we certainly know
   they cannot do. So that it is necessary, if I intend that the following
   considerations should do any good, to assure men that it is not
   impossible for them to make a resolution of leaving their sins and
   returning to God.

   It is a power which every man is naturally invested withal, to
   consider, and judge, and choose. To consider, that is, to weigh and
   compare things together; to judge, that is, to determine which is best;
   and to choose, that is, to resolve to do it or not: and there is
   nothing more evident and more universally acknowledged in temporal
   cases, and in the affairs and concernments of this life. In these
   matters resolution is a thing ordinary and of frequent practice; it is
   the principle of all great and considerable actions. Men resolve to be
   great in this world, and by virtue of this resolution, when they have
   once taken it up, what industry will they not use! what hazards will
   they not run in the pursuit of their ambitious designs! Difficulties
   and dangers do rather whet their courage, and set an edge upon their
   spirits. Men resolve to be rich; the apostle speaks of some that will
   be rich: (1 Tim. vi.) "They that will be rich:" and though this be but
   a low and mean design, yet these persons, by virtue of this resolution,
   will toil and take prodigious pains in it.

   And as to spiritual things, every man hath the same power radically;
   that is, he hath the faculties of understanding and will, but these are
   obstructed and hindered in their exercise, and strongly biassed a
   contrary way by the power of evil inclinations and habits; so that, as
   to the exercise of this power, and the effect of it in spiritual
   things, men are in a sort as much disabled as if they were destitute of
   it. For it is, in effect, all one, to have no understanding at all to
   consider things that are spiritual, as to have the understanding
   blinded by an invincible prejudice; to have no liberty as to spiritual
   things, as to have the will strongly biassed against them. For a man
   that hath this prejudice upon his under standing, and this bias upon
   his will is, to all intents and purposes, as if he were destitute of
   these faculties. But then we are not to understand this impotency to be
   absolutely natural, but accidental; not to be in the first frame and
   constitution of our souls, but to have happened upon the depravation of
   nature. It is not a want of natural faculties, but the binding of them
   up and hindering their operations to certain purposes. This impotency
   proceeds from the power of evil habits. And thus the Scripture
   expresseth it, and compares an impotency arising from bad habits and
   customs to a natural impossibility; nothing coming nearer to nature,
   than a powerful custom. "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
   leopard his spots? Then may ye also, that are accustomed to do evil,
   learn to do well."

   But now God by the gospel hath designed the recovery of mankind from
   the slavery of sin, and the power of their lusts; and therefore, as, by
   the death of Christ, he hath provided a way to remove the guilt of sin,
   so, by the Spirit of Christ, he furnisheth us with sufficient power to
   destroy the dominion of sin. I say sufficient, if we be not wanting to
   ourselves, but be "workers together with God," and be as diligent "to
   work out our own salvation," as he is ready "to work in us both to will
   and to do."

   So that, when we persuade men to repent and change their lives, and to
   resolve upon a better course, we do not exhort them to any thing that
   is absolutely out of their power, but to what they may do; though not
   of themselves, yet by the grace of God, which is always ready to assist
   them, unless, by their former gross neglects and long obstinacy in an
   evil course, they have provoked God to withdraw his grace from them. So
   that though, considering our own strength abstractedly, and separately
   from the grace of God, these things be not in our power; yet the grace
   of God puts them into our power.

   And this is so far from derogating from the grace of God, that it is
   highly to the praise of it. For if the grace of God makes us able to
   repent and resolve upon a new life, he that asserts this does not
   attribute his repentance to himself, but to the grace of God: nay, he
   that says that God's grace excites and is ready to assist men to do
   what God commands, represents God immensely more good and gracious,
   than he that says that God commands men to do that which by their
   natural power they cannot do, and will condemn them for not doing it,
   and yet denies them that grace which is necessary to the doing of it.

   Let this then be established as a necessary consideration to prevent
   discouragement, that to resolve upon the change of our lives, is that
   which, by the grace of God, we are enabled to do, if we will.
   Resolution is no strange and extraordinary thing; it is one of the most
   common acts that belongs to us as we are men; but we do not ordinarily
   apply it to the best purposes. It is not so ordinary for men to resolve
   to be good, as to be rich and great; not so common for men to resolve
   against sin, as to resolve against poverty and suffering. It is not so
   usual for men to resolve to keep a good conscience, as to keep a good
   place. Indeed, our corrupt nature is much more opposite to this holy
   kind of resolution. But then to balance and answer this, God hath
   promised greater and more immediate assistance to us in this case than
   in any other. There is a general blessing and common assistance
   promised to resolution and diligence about temporal things; and God's
   providence doth often advance such persons to riches and honour. "The
   diligent hand, with God's blessing, makes rich;" as Solomon tells us,
   (Prov. x. 4.) and, (xxii. 29.) "Seest thou (says he) a man diligent in
   his business? He shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before
   mean men!" Now diligence is the effect of a great and vigorous
   resolution. But there is a special and extraordinary blessing and
   assistance that attends the resolution and endeavour of a holy life.
   God hath not promised to strengthen men with all might in the way to
   riches and honours, and to assist the ambitious and covetous designers
   of this world with "a mighty and glorious power, such as raised up
   Jesus from the dead:" but this he hath promised to those, who with a
   firm purpose and resolution do engage in the ways of religion. Let us
   then shake off our sloth and listlessness, and in that strength and
   assistance which God offers, let us resolve to leave our sins, and to
   amend our lives.

   2. Consider what it is that you are to resolve upon; to leave your sins
   and to return to God and goodness. So that the things I am persuading
   you to resolve upon, are the strongest reasons that can be for such a
   resolution. Sin is such a thing, that there can be no better argument
   to make men resolve against it than to consider what it is, and to
   think seriously of the nature and consequence of it. And God and
   goodness are so amiable and desirable, that the very proposal of these
   objects, hath invitations and allurements enough to inflame our desires
   after them, and to make us rush into the embraces of them. If we would
   but enter into the serious consideration of them, we should soon be
   resolved in our minds about them.

   Do but consider a little what sin is. It is the shame and blemish of
   thy nature, the reproach and disgrace of thy understanding and reason,
   the great deformity and disease of thy soul, and the eternal enemy of
   thy rest and peace. It is thy shackles and thy fetters, the tyrant that
   oppresses thee and restrains thee of thy liberty, and condemns thee to
   the basest slavery and the vilest drudgery. It is the unnatural and
   violent state of thy soul, the worm that perpetually gnaws thy
   conscience, the cause of all thy fears and troubles, and of all the
   evils and miseries, all the mischief and disorders that are in the
   world; it is the foundation and fuel of hell; it is that which puts
   thee out of the possession and enjoyment of thyself, which doth
   alienate and separate thee from God, the fountain of bliss and
   happiness, which provokes him to be thine enemy, and lays thee open
   every moment to the fierce revenge of his justice; and if thou dost
   persist and continue in it, will finally sink and oppress thee under
   the insupportable weight of his wrath, and make thee so weary of
   thyself, that thou shall wish a thousand times that thou hadst never
   been; and will render thee so perfectly miserable, that thou wouldest
   esteem it a great happiness to change thy condition with the most
   wretched and forlorn person that ever lived upon earth, to be
   perpetually upon a rack, and to lie down for ever under the rage of all
   the most violent diseases and pains that ever afflicted mankind. Sin is
   all this which I have described, and will certainly bring upon thee all
   those evils and mischiefs which I have mentioned, and make thee far
   more miserable than I am able to express, or thou to conceive. And art
   thou not yet resolved to leave it? Shall I need to use any other
   arguments to set thee against it, and take thee off from the love and
   practice of it, than this representation which I have now made of the
   horrible nature and consequences of it?

   And then consider, on the other hand, what it is that I am persuading
   thee to turn to; to thy God and duty. And would not this be a blessed
   change indeed! to leave the greatest evil, and to turn to the chief
   good! For this resolution of returning to God, is nothing else but a
   resolution to be wise and happy, and to put thyself into the possession
   of that which is a greater good, if it is possible, than sin is an
   evil, and will render thee more happy than sin can make thee miserable.
   Didst thou but think what God is, and what he will be to thee if thou
   wilt return to him, how kindly he will receive thee after all thy
   wanderings from him "days with out number," thou wouldest soon take up
   the resolution of the prodigal, and say, "I will arise, and go to my
   father!"

   And consider, likewise, what it is to return to thy duty. It is nothing
   else but to do what becomes thee, and what is suitable to the original
   fame of thy nature, and to the truest dictates of thy reason and
   conscience, and what is not more thy duty, than it is thy interest and
   thy happiness. For that which God requires of us is, to be righteous
   and holy, and good; that is, to be like God himself, who is the pattern
   of all perfection and happiness. It is to have our lives conformed to
   his will, which is al ways perfect holiness and goodness, a state of
   peace and tranquillity, and the very temper and disposition of
   happiness. It is that which is a principal and most essential
   ingredient into the felicity of the Divine nature, and without which
   God would not be what he is, but a deformed, and imperfect, and
   miserable being.

   And if this be a true representation which I have made to you, of sin
   and vice on the one hand, and of God and goodness on the other, what
   can be more powerful than the serious consideration of it, to engage us
   to a speedy resolution of leaving our sins, and of turning and
   "cleaving to the Lord with full purpose of heart?" After this we cannot
   but conclude with the penitent in the text; "Surely it is meet to be
   said unto God, I will not offend any more: that which I see not, teach
   thou me;" and "if I have done iniquity. I will do no more."

   3. Consider how unreasonable it is to be unresolved in a case of so
   great moment and concernment. There is no greater argument of a man's
   weakness, than irresolution in matters of mighty consequence, when both
   the importance of the thing, and exigency of present circumstances,
   require a speedy resolution. We should account it a strange folly, for
   a man to be unresolved in the clearest and plainest matters that
   concern his temporal welfare and safety. If a man could not determine
   himself whether he should eat or starve; if he were dangerously sick,
   and could not determine whether he should take physic or die; or if one
   that were in prison, could not resolve himself whether he should accept
   of liberty, and be content to be released; or if a fair estate were
   offered to him, he should desire seven years time to consider whether
   he should take it or not: this would be so absurd in the common affairs
   of life, that a man would be thought infatuated, that should be
   doubtful and unresolved in cases so plain, and of such pressing
   concernment. If a man were under the sentence and condemnation of the
   law, and liable to be executed upon the least intimation of the
   prince's pleasure, and a pardon were graciously offered to him, with
   this intimation, that this would probably be the last offer of mercy
   that ever would be made to him; one would think that in this case a man
   should soon be determined what to do, or rather that he should not need
   to deliberate at all about it; because there is no danger of rashness
   in making haste to save his life.

   And yet the case of a sinner is of far greater importance, and much
   more depends upon it, infinitely more than any temporal concernment
   whatsoever can amount to, even our happiness or misery to all eternity.
   And can there be any difficulty for a man to be resolved what is to be
   done in such a case? No case surely in the world can be plainer than
   this; whether a man should leave his sins, and return to God and his
   duty, or not; that is, whether a man should choose to be happy or
   miserable, unspeakably and everlastingly happy, or extremely and
   eternally miserable.

   And the circumstances and exigencies of our case do call for a speedy
   and peremptory resolution in this matter. The sentence of the law is
   already passed, and God may execute it upon thee every moment; and it
   is great mercy and forbearance not to do it. Thy life is uncertain, and
   thou art liable every minute to be snatched away and hurried out of
   this world. However, at the best, thou hast but a little time to
   resolve in; death, and judgment, and eternity cannot be far off, and,
   for aught thou knowest, they may be even at the door. Thou art upon the
   matter just ready to be seized upon by death, to be summoned to
   judgment, and to be swallowed up of eternity: and is it not yet time
   thinkest thou to resolve? Wouldest thou have yet a little longer time
   to deliberate, whether thou shouldest repent and forsake thy sins, or
   not? If there were difficulty in the case, or if there were no danger
   in the delay; if thou couldest gain time, or any thing else, by
   suspending thy resolution, there were then some reason why thou
   shouldest not make a sudden determination. But thou canst pretend none
   of these. It is evident, at first sight, what is best to be done, and
   nothing can make it plainer. It is not a matter so clear and out of the
   controversy, that riches are better than poverty, and ease better than
   pain, and life more desirable than death, as it is, that it is better
   to break off our sins, than to continue in the practice of them; to be
   reconciled to God, than to go on to provoke him; to be holy and
   virtuous, than to be wicked and vicious; to be "heirs of eternal
   glory," than to be "vessels of wrath fitted for destruction."

   And there is infinite danger in these delays. For if thy soul be any
   thing to thee, thou venturest that; if thou hast any tenderness and
   regard for thy eternal interest, thou runnest the hazard of that; if
   heaven and hell be any thing to thee, thou incurrest the danger of
   losing one, and falling into the other.

   And thou gainest nothing by continuing unresolved. If death and
   judgment would tarry thy leisure, and wait till thou hadst brought thy
   thoughts to some issue, and were resolved what to do, it were
   something: but thy irresolution in this matter will be so far from
   keeping back death and judgment, that it will both hasten and aggravate
   them, both make them to come the sooner, and to be the heavier when
   they come; because thou abusest the goodness of God, and despisest his
   patience and long-suffering, which should lead thee, and draw thee on
   to repentance, and not keep thee back. Hereby thou encouragest thyself
   in thy lewd and riotous courses; and, because thy Lord delayeth his
   coming, art the more negligent and extravagant. Hear what doom our Lord
   pronounceth upon such slothful and wicked servant: (Luke xii. 46.) "The
   lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him,
   and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and
   will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers." None so like to be
   surprised, and to be severely handled by the justice of God, as those
   that trifle with his patience.

   4. Consider how much resolution would tend to the settling of our
   minds, and making our lives comfortable. There is nothing that
   perplexeth and disquieteth a man more, than to be unresolved in the
   great and important concernments of his life. What anxiety and
   confusion is there in our spirits, whilst we are doubtful and
   undetermined about such matters? How are we divided and distracted,
   when our reason and judgment direct us one way, and our lusts and
   affections bias us to the contrary? When we are convinced and satisfied
   what is best for us, and yet are disaffected to our own interest. Such
   a man is all the while self-condemned, and acts with the perpetual
   regret of his reason and conscience; and whenever he reflects upon
   himself, he is of fended and angry with himself, his life and all his
   actions are uneasy and displeasing to him; and there is no way for this
   man to be at peace, but to put an end to this conflict one way or
   other, either by conquering his reason or his will. The former is very
   difficult, nothing being harder than for a sinner to lay his conscience
   asleep, after it is once thoroughly awakened; he may charm it for a
   while, but every little occasion will rouse it again, and renew his
   trouble; so that though a man may have some truce with his conscience,
   yet he can never come to a firm and settled peace this way; but if by a
   vigorous resolution a man would but conquer his will, his mind would be
   at rest, and there would be a present calm in his spirit. And why
   should we be such enemies to our own peace, and to the comfort and
   contentment of our lives, as not to take this course, and thereby rid
   ourselves at once of that which really, and at the bottom, is the
   ground of all the trouble and disquiet of our lives?
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CLXVIII.

  THE NATURE AND NECESSITY OF HOLY RESOLUTION.

   Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I
   will not offend any more: that which I see not, teach thou me; if I
   have done iniquity, I wilt do no more.--Job xxxiv. 31, 32.

   THESE words are a description of the temper and behaviour of a true
   penitent, his confession of sins, and resolution of amendment.
   Concerning resolution, I have shewn what it is in general: what is the
   special object or matter of this kind of resolution: what is implied in
   a sincere resolution of leaving our sins, and returning to God and our
   duty: that in this resolution the very essence and formal nature of
   repentance doth consist: and have offered some considerations, to
   convince men of the necessity and fitness of this resolution, and to
   keep them steadfast to it. As,

   1. That this resolution is nothing but what, under the influence of
   God's grace, is in our power.

   2. The things themselves, which we are to resolve upon, are the
   strongest arguments that can be for such a resolution.

   3. How unreasonable it is for men to be unresolved in a case of so
   great moment.

   4. How much this resolution will tend to the settling of our minds, and
   making our lives comfort able. I proceed to the considerations which
   remain.

   5. Then be pleased to consider, that a strong and vigorous resolution
   would make the whole work of religion easy to us; it would conquer all
   difficulties which attend a holy and religious course of life,
   especially at our first entrance into it: because resolution brings our
   minds to a point, and unites all the strength and force of our souls in
   one great design, and makes us vigorous and firm, courageous and
   constant in the prosecution of it: and without this it is impossible to
   hold out long, and to resist the strong propensions and inclinations of
   our corrupt nature, which, if we be not firmly resolved, will return,
   and by degrees gain upon us; it will be impossible to break through
   temptations, and to gainsay the importunity of them: when the devil and
   the world solicit us, we shall not be able to say them nay, but shall
   be apt to yield to them.

   There are many who have had faint wishes, and cold desires, and half
   purposes, of leading a new and better life: but having not taken up a
   firm resolution in the case, having not determined themselves by a
   severe purpose, a little thing sways them, and brings them back to
   their former course; it is no hard matter to divert them and engage
   them another way; they are "shaken with every wind" of temptation,
   every little blast of opposition and persecution turns them back, and
   carries them to the ways of sin: whereas resolution fixeth a man's
   spirit, and makes it most steadfast and unmoveable, and sets him upon a
   rock, which, "when the winds blow, and the rain falls, and the floods
   come," abides firm against all impressions.

   If I would give the most probable and useful advice to engage and
   continue a man in a good course, I would commend to him a deliberate
   and firm resolution. David proved this way with very happy success;
   (Psal. cxix. 106.) "I have sworn (says he) and will perform it, (hat I
   will keep thy righteous judgments." This was a security to him against
   all assaults, and nothing could turn him from his course afterwards;
   not the dangers he was exposed to, (ver. 109.) "My soul is continually
   in my hand, yet do I not forget thy law;" not the snares of wicked men
   that were laid for him, (ver. 110.) "The wicked have laid a snare for
   me, yet I erred not from thy precepts." By virtue of this resolution,
   he could rise up in defiance of all those that would have tempted him
   to any sinful action: (ver. 115.) "Depart from me, ye evil doers, for I
   will keep the commandments of my God."

   When a man is thus resolved upon a holy course he is not easily
   diverted from it, and is able to resist the importunity and flattery of
   temptations, and to say to them, as men are wont to do, when they are
   fully and firmly resolved upon any thing, "Let me alone, I am not to be
   moved, it is in vain to urge me, I am resolved to the contrary." Thus
   stiff and resolute men can be in other cases, where there is not near
   that cause and reason for it; and if we would but take up a generous
   resolution to break off our sins, and to live better lives, this would
   be the way to conquer that listlessness and unwillingness which hinders
   us from engaging in a good course, and is the cause of so many lame
   excuses and unreasonable delays. It is the want of resolution, and the
   weakness of our resolutions, which is the true reason why we are not
   more equal, and constant, and uniform in the ways of religion; but are
   religious only by fits and starts, in a heat, and during some present
   trouble and conviction of mind. "The double-minded man is unstable
   (says St. James) in all his ways." When a man is of several minds, he
   is easily moved one way or other.

   6. And lastly, Consider the infinite danger of remaining unresolved.
   The evil day may overtake you, while you are deliberating whether you
   should avoid it or not. A state of sin is liable to so many hazards,
   hath so many dangers continually threatening it, and hanging over it,
   that it is the most imprudent thing in the world to linger in it. It is
   like Lot's staying in Sodom, when the Lord was going to destroy it,
   when fire and brimstone were just ready to be rained down from heaven
   upon it. Whilst men are lingering in a sinful state, if "the Lord be
   not merciful to them," they will be consumed. Therefore it concerns
   thee, sinner, to determine thyself speedily, and to make haste out of
   this dangerous condition, "to escape for thy life, lest some evil
   overtake thee," and lest death, finding thee unresolved, determine thy
   case for thee, and put it out of all doubt, and past all remedy.

   How many have been cut off in their irresolution! and because they
   would not determine what to do, God hath concluded their case for them,
   and "sworn in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest." It
   may be thou promisest thyself the space of many years to resolve in:
   "Thou fool, this night thy soul" may "be required of thee;" and whilst
   thou art unresolved what to do, God is resolving what to do with thee,
   and putting a period to his patience and long expectation of thy
   repentance: and thou knowest not how soon God may do this, and make an
   immutable determination concerning thee. And woe unto thee, when God
   hath resolved thus!

   Suppose thou shouldest be snatched out of the world, and hurried before
   the dreadful tribunal of God, in this doubtful and unresolved state.
   And this is possible enough; because thou hast no certain tenure of thy
   life, thou art at no time secured from the stroke of death: nay, it is
   probable enough, because thou art every moment liable to ten thousand
   accidents, any one of which may snap in sunder the thread of thy life.
   And suppose this should happen to thee, what dost thou imagine would
   become of thee? Wouldest not thou then wish a thousand times that thou
   hadst resolved in time? How glad wouldest thou then be, that it were
   possible for thee to retrieve and call back but one of those "days
   without number," which thou hast so vainly trifled away, that thou
   mightest resolve upon the things of thy peace! but thou wouldest not do
   it in that thy day, which God afforded thee to this purpose; thou hast
   let the opportunity slip out of thy hands, and it will never be in thy
   power again, but "the things of thy peace will be" for ever "hid from
   thine eyes."

   Why wilt thou then be so foolish, as to run thyself upon the evident
   hazard of losing heaven, and being miserable for ever? Why wilt thou
   make work for a sadder and longer repentance, than that which thou dost
   now so carefully decline? This was the case of the foolish virgins in
   the parable, (Matt. xxv.) who made account to be ready "to meet the
   bridegroom" at his coming, but took no care in time to get oil into
   their lamps. They thought the bride groom would tarry yet a while
   longer, and therefore "they slumbered and slept" in great security; but
   at midnight, when "the cry was made, Behold the bridegroom cometh;"
   then they arose, and in a great hurry and confusion went about
   "trimming their lamps;" they were resolved then, they would have begged
   or bought oil; and would have been at any pains or cost for it: but
   then it was too late; for the door was suddenly shut against them, and
   no importunity could prevail to have it opened to them.

   Canst thou be contented to have the door shut against thee, and when
   thou shalt cry, "Lord open unto me," to have him return this answer,
   "Depart from me, I know thee not?" If thou canst not, resolve to
   prevent this in time.

   Didst thou but see, and know, and feel what the miserable do in hell,
   thou couldest not linger thus, thou couldest not continue so long
   unresolved. Why the time will come, when thou wilt reflect severely
   upon thyself, and say, That I should ever be so stupid and sottish, to
   be unresolved in a matter of such infinite concernment to me! How often
   was I admonished and convinced of the necessity of changing my course?
   How many inward motions had I to that purpose? How often did my own
   reason and conscience, and the Holy Spirit of God, by his frequent and
   friendly suggestions, put me upon this? How often was I just upon the
   brink of resolving? I resolved to resolve; but still I delayed it till
   death seized upon me unresolved: and now the opportunity is lost, and
   never to be recovered again! I would not in time resolve to be wise and
   happy; and now, by the sentence of the just and unchangeable God, it is
   resolved that I must be miserable to all eternity!

   How should these considerations quicken us, who have yet these
   opportunities in our hands; which those who neglected and trifled them
   away, would now purchase at any rate! I say, how should these
   considerations which I have proposed, move us to take up a present
   resolution in the matter! Consider these things, sinner, and lay them
   seriously to heart, and say to thyself, Fool that I have been, to be
   unresolved so long; not to determine myself in a matter of such mighty
   consequence; to continue so long in suspense, whether I had best go to
   heaven or hell, and which was most advisable, to be happy or miserable
   for ever! Blessed be God, that hath been pleased to exercise so much
   patience and long-suffering towards me, that hath spared me so long,
   when he might have taken me away, and cut me off unresolved! My soul
   lies at stake, and, for aught I know, all eternity depends upon my
   present and speedy resolution. And now, by God's grace, I will not
   delay one moment more, I will hang no longer between heaven and
   hell.--I shall now, in the

   Second place, Offer some considerations to persuade those that have
   taken up this good resolution, to pursue it, and to promote it to
   practice and execution, and to keep firm and steadfast to it. And to
   this end, be pleased to consider these three things:

   1. What an argument it is of vanity and inconstancy, to change this
   resolution, whilst the reason of it stands good, and is not changed. I
   suppose that thou wert once resolved to leave thy sins, and to return
   to God and thy duty? Why dost thou not pursue this resolution? Why dost
   thou not persist in it? Surely there appeared to thee some reason why
   thou didst take it up; and if the reason remain, and appear still the
   same to thee that it did, how comes it to pass that thou hast altered
   thy mind, and changed thy purpose? Either the case is the same it was,
   when thou tookest up this resolution, or it is not. If it be altered,
   then thou hast reason to change thy resolution: if it be not, thou hast
   the same reason to continue in it, that thou hadst to take it up. Shew
   then, if thou canst, wherein it is changed? Wert thou mistaken before
   about the nature of sin, and the pernicious consequences of it; or
   about the nature of God and goodness? Hast thou any thing now to plead
   for sin, which thou didst not know or consider before? Art thou now
   satisfied that sin is not so evil and unreasonable a thing as thou
   didst once apprehend, or that it does not threaten thee with so much
   danger as thou didst fear? Hath God altered his opinion of it, or is he
   become more favourable to it than he was? Hast thou received any news
   lately from heaven by any good hands, that God hath reversed his
   threatenings against sin, or that he hath adjourned the judgment of the
   world, sine die, without any set time? That he hath set the devils at
   liberty, and released them from their chains of darkness, and hath
   quenched and put out the fire of hell? Or art thou satisfied that there
   is no such being as God in the world, or that he is not so good as thou
   didst apprehend him to be, or that he will not reward those that
   diligently serve him? Hast thou found upon trial, that holiness and
   virtue are but empty names, and there is nothing in them? That there is
   not that pleasure and peace in keeping the commandments of God which
   thou wert told of? I am sure thou canst not with reason pretend any
   thing of all this. Thy reason, and conscience, and experience cannot
   speak one word on the behalf of sin, or give any testimony against God
   and his holy ways. And if the case be the same it was, nothing but
   thine own vanity and fickleness, or some worse reason, could move thee
   to alter thy purpose.

   2. Let it be farther considered, that if we be not constant to our
   resolution, all we have done is lost. If thou repentest of thy
   repentance, it will not prove a "repentance to salvation." As good to
   have stayed in Sodom, as to look back after thou art come out of it.
   Thus God tells us by the prophet, (Ezek. xxxiii. 12, 13.) "Therefore,
   thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness
   of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression:
   neither shall the righteous be able to live in the day that he sinneth.
   When I say to the righteous, he shall surely live; if he trust to his
   own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousness shall not
   be remembered: but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall
   die for it." So that, whatever we have done in the work of repentance,
   what resolutions soever we have taken up; if afterwards we give over
   and let them fall, all that we have done is lost, and will come to
   nothing.

   3. Let us consider, in the last place, that if we be not constant to
   our resolution, we shall not only lose all that we have done, but we
   shall thereby render our condition much worse. "Remember Lot's wife,"
   who, after she was escaped out of Sodom, looked back, and was made a
   particular and lasting monument of God's wrath and displeasure; which
   seems to be meant by that expression of her being "turned into a pillar
   of salt;" that is, "a lasting monument." (Prov. xiv. 14.) "The
   backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways." "Shall be
   filled with his own ways;" this expression doth signify a most heavy
   and dreadful curse upon those who fall off from their good purpose and
   resolution, that they shall have sorrow and trouble enough upon it. For
   so likewise, (Prov. i. 26, 27.) where God threatens wilful and
   obstinate sinners with the heaviest judgments, that he would "laugh at
   their calamity, and mock when their fear comes, when their fear comes
   as desolation, and their destruction as a whirlwind, and fear and
   anguish cometh upon them;" he adds, as the sum of all other judgments,
   that "they shall eat the fruit of their own ways, and be filled with
   their own devices." (Heb. x. 38.) "But if any man draw back, my soul
   shall have no pleasure in him;" which words are a mei'osis, and signify
   a great deal more than seems to be expressed. "My soul shall have no
   pleasure in him;" that is, let such an one expect the effects of God's
   fiercest wrath and displeasure. For so the Hebrews are wont to express
   things that are great and unspeakable, when they cannot sufficiently
   set them forth; by saying less, they say more. So, (Psal. v. 4.) where
   it is said, u Thou art not a God that hast pleasure in wickedness;" the
   Psalmist means, and would have us to understand it so, that God is so
   far from taking any pleasure in the sins of men, that he bears the most
   violent hatred and displeasure against them. So, when the apostle here
   says, "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him;" he
   means, that it is not to be expressed how God will deal with such
   persons, and how severely his justice will handle them. To the same
   purpose is that declaration, (2 Pet. ii. 20, 21.) "For if, after they
   have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the
   Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and
   overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. For it
   had been better for them, not to have known the way of righteousness,
   than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment
   delivered unto them." The condition of all impenitent sinners is very
   sad; but of apostates much worse: not only because the sins which they
   commit afterwards are much greater, receiving a new aggravation, which
   the sins of those who are simply impenitent are not capable of; but
   likewise because such persons are usually more wicked afterwards. For
   they that break loose from severe purposes and resolutions of a better
   course, do by this very thing in a great measure sear and conquer their
   consciences, and then no wonder if afterwards "they give up themselves
   to commit all iniquity with greediness." When, after long abstinence
   men return to sin again, their lusts are more fierce and violent; like
   a man who, after long fasting, returns to his meat with a more raging
   appetite. This our Saviour sets forth to us in the parable of the
   unclean spirit's returning again and taking possession of the man,
   after he had left him: (Matt. xii. 43-45.) "When the unclean spirit is
   gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and
   findeth none. Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I
   came out: and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and
   garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
   more wicked than himself; and the end of that man is worse than his
   beginning." The moral of which is, that when a man hath once left his
   sins, if afterward he entertain thoughts of returning to them again,
   sin will return upon him with redoubled force and strength, and his
   heart will be so much the more prepared and disposed for the
   entertaining of more and greater vices; and his leaving his sins for a
   time, will he but like a running back, that he may leap with greater
   violence into hell and destruction.

   Besides that, such persons do the greatest injury to God and the holy
   ways of religion that can be, by forsaking them after they have owned
   and approved them. For it will not be so much regarded, what wicked
   men, who have always been so, talk against God and religion; because
   they do not talk from experience, but "speak evil of the things which
   they know not:" whereas those who forsake the ways of religion after
   they have once engaged in them, do disparage religion more effectually,
   and reproach it with greater advantage; because they pretend to speak
   from the experience they have had of it, they have tried both the ways
   of sin and the ways of religion, and, after experience of both, they
   return to sin again: which, what is it but to proclaim to the world
   that the ways of sin and vice are rather to be chosen than the ways of
   holiness and virtue; that the devil is a better master than God, and
   that a sinful and wicked life yields more pleasure and greater
   advantages than are to be had in keeping the commandments of God? And
   this must needs be a high provocation, and a heavy aggravation of our
   ruin. Let these considerations prevail with us to pursue his holy
   resolution, after we have taken it up, and to persist in it. There
   remains only the

   VI. Sixth and last particular which I proposed to be spoken to; viz. To
   add some directions for the maintaining and making good of this
   resolution of repentance and amendment; and they shall be these three:

   1. Let us do all in the strength of God, considering our necessary and
   essential dependance upon him, and that without him and the assistance
   of his grace we can do nothing. "We are not (as the apostle tells us)
   sufficient of ourselves, as of ourselves," that is, without the
   assistance of God's Holy Spirit, to think any thing that is good, much
   less to resolve upon it. "It is God that worketh in us both to will and
   to do, of his good pleasure;" that is, of his own goodness, as the same
   apostle speaks, (Phil. ii. 13.) It is God that upholds us in being, and
   from whom we have all our power as to natural actions; but as to
   spiritual things, considering the great corruption and depravation of
   human nature, we stand in need of a more especial and immediate
   assistance.

   If we know any thing of ourselves, we cannot but know what foolish and
   ignorant creatures we are, how weak and impotent, how averse and
   opposite to any thing that is good. And therefore it is wise counsel in
   all cases, but chiefly in spiritual matters, which Solomon gives,
   (Prov. iii. 5, 6.) "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean
   not to thy own understanding. Acknowledge him in all thy ways, and he
   shall direct thy steps." Let us then address ourselves to God, in the
   words of the holy prophet: (Jer. x. 23.) "O Lord, I know that the way
   of man is not in himself, and that it is not in man that walketh to
   direct his steps." And let us beg of him, that he would consider our
   case, commiserate our weakness, and pity our impotency, and that he
   would join his strength to us, and grant us the assistance of his grace
   and Holy Spirit, to put us upon sincere resolutions of a new life, and
   to keep us constant and steadfast to them; "to open the eyes of our
   minds, and to turn us from darkness to light, and from the power of
   Satan and our lusts unto God; that we may repent and turn to God, and
   do works meet for repentance, that so we may receive forgiveness of
   sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified through faith
   that is in Christ."

   And for our encouragement in this matter, God hath bid us to apply
   ourselves to him; and he hath promised not to be wanting to us, in
   words as express and universal as can well be devised: (Jam. i. 5, 6.)
   "If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all
   liberally, and upbraideth no man but let him ask in faith, nothing
   wavering;" that is, not doubting but that God is both able and willing
   to give what he asks. And, (Luke xi. 9-13.) "I say unto you, Ask, and
   it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be
   opened unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that
   seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. If a
   son should ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a
   stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Of
   if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being
   evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more
   shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"
   To encourage our faith, our Saviour useth such an argument as may give
   us the greatest assurance. We are commonly confident, that our earthly
   parents will not deny us those things that are good and necessary for
   us, though they may be otherwise evil: "How much more then shall our
   heavenly Father," who is essentially and infinitely good, give his Holy
   Spirit to us? And if this be not enough, St. Matthew useth a larger
   expression, "How much more shall your heavenly Father give good things
   to them that ask him?" If there be any thing that is good, and we stand
   in need of it, and earnestly pray to God for it, we may be confident
   that he will give it us.

   2. We ought to be very watchful over ourselves, considering our
   weakness and wavering, and instability and fickleness, the treachery
   and deceitfulness of our own hearts, and the malice of Satan. It will
   be a great while before the habits of sin be so weakened and subdued as
   that we shall have no propension to return to them again; so that our
   hearts will be often endeavouring to return to their former posture,
   and, like a deceitful bow, which is not firmly strung, to start back.
   And besides the deceitfulness of sin and our own hearts, the devil is
   very malicious, and his malice will make him vigilant to watch all
   advantages against us; and his great design will be to shake our
   resolution; for if that stand, he knows his kingdom will fall, and
   therefore he raiseth all his batteries against this fort, and labours
   by all means to undermine it; and nothing will be matter of greater
   triumph to him than to gain a person that was revolted from him, and
   resolved to leave his service. If, therefore, thou expectest God's
   grace and assistance to keep thee steadfast to thy resolution, do not
   neglect thyself, but "keep thy heart with ail diligence," and watch
   carefully over thyself; for because "God worketh in us both to will and
   to do," therefore he expects that "we should work out our salvation
   with fear and trembling," lest, by our own carelessness and neglect, we
   should miscarry.

   3. Let us frequently renew and reinforce our resolutions, more
   especially when we think of coming to the sacrament, and approaching
   the holy table of the Lord. Nothing is more apt to beget in us good
   resolutions, and to strengthen them, than to consider the dreadful
   sufferings of the Son of God for our sins, which are so lively set
   forth and represented to us in this holy sacrament; which, as it is, on
   God's part, a seal and confirmation of his grace and love to us; so, on
   our part, it ought to be a solemn ratification of our covenant with
   God, "to depart from iniquity," and "to walk before him in holiness and
   righteousness all the days of our lives."
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CLXIX.

  THE NATURE AND NECESSITY OF RESTITUTION.

   And if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I
   restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation
   come to this house.--Luke xix. 8, 9.

   ONE particular and eminent fruit of true repentance, is the making of
   restitution and satisfaction to those whom we have injured. As for God,
   we can make no satisfaction and compensation to him, for the injuries
   we have done him by our sins; all that we can do in respect of God, is
   to confess our sins to him, to make acknowledgment of our miscarriages,
   to be heartily troubled for what we have done, and not to do the like
   for the future. But for injuries done to men, we may, in many cases,
   make reparation and satisfaction. And this, as it is one of the best
   signs and evidences of a true repentance; so it is one of the most
   proper and genuine effects of it: for this is as much as in us lies to
   undo what we have done, and to unsin our sins.

   But, because the practice of this duty doth so interfere with the
   interest of men, and consequently it will be very difficult to convince
   men of their duty in this particular, and to persuade them to it;
   therefore I design to handle this particular fruit and effect of a true
   repentance by itself, from these words, which contain in them,

   I. The fruit and effect of Zaccheus's conversion and repentance; "If I
   have taken any thing from any man, I restore him fourfold."

   II. The declaration which our Saviour makes hereupon, of the truth of
   his repentance and conversion, and the happy state he was thereby put
   into. "And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
   house, forasmuch as he also is the son of Abraham;" as if he had said,
   By these fruits and effects it appears, that this is a repentance to
   salvation; and this man whom you look upon as a sinner and a heathen,
   may, by better right, call Abraham father, than any of you formal
   pharisees and Jews, who glory so much in being the "children of
   Abraham."

   I. The fruit and effect of Zaccheus's conversion and repentance; "And
   if," &c.

   This Zaccheus, as you find at the 2d verse, was chief of the publicans,
   which was an office of great odium and infamy among the Jews, they
   being the collectors of the tribute which the Roman emperor, under
   whose power the Jews then were, did exact from them. And because these
   publicans farmed this tribute of the emperor at a certain rent, they
   made a gain out of it themselves, by exacting and requiring more of the
   people than was due upon that account; so that their calling was very
   infamous upon three accounts.

   1. Because they were the instruments of oppressing their countrymen;
   for so they looked upon the tax they paid to the Romans, as a great
   oppression.

   2. Because they were forced by the necessity of their calling to have
   familiar conversation with heathens, whom they looked upon as sinners.
   Hence the phrase used by the apostle, of "sinners of the gentiles." And
   hence, likewise, probably it is, that publicans and sinners, publicans
   and heathens, are joined several times together, because of the
   occasions of frequent converse which the publicans had with the
   heathens.

   3. But, principally, they were odious because of the common injustice
   and oppression which they used in the management of their calling, by
   fraud and violence extorting more than was due, to enhance the profit
   of their places. Hence it is, that this sort of officers have been
   generally branded, and reckoned among the worst sort of men. So he in
   the comedy, Pa'ntes telonai, pa'ntes eisi`n a'rpages, "all publicans
   are rapacious or robbers." And this is most probably the sin which
   Zaccheus here repents of, and in regard to which he promises
   restitution, kai ei tinos ti esukophantesa, "And if I have taken any
   thing from any man by false accusation;" so we render the words in our
   translation: but the word esukophantesa signifies more generally, "If I
   have been injurious to any one, if I have wronged any man," as appears
   by the constant use of this word by the LXX. who by this word do
   translate the most general Hebrew words which signify any kind of
   injury or oppression, either by fraud, or violence, or calumny. So that
   there is no reason here to restrain it, "wronging men by false
   accusation:" for Zaccheus's sin being in all probability extorting more
   than was due, this might as easily be done many other ways, as "by
   false accusation." And that this was the common sin of the publicans,
   appears by the counsel which John the Baptist gives them: (Luke iii.
   12, 13.) "Then came also the publicans to be baptized, and said unto
   him, Master, what shall we do? And he said unto them, Exact no more
   than that which is appointed you;" that is, do not, by fraud or
   violence, extort from any man more than the tribute which is laid upon
   him.

   So that Zaccheus here promiseth, that if he had been injurious to any
   man in his office, by extorting more than was due, he would restore to
   him fourfold. And if Zaccheus calculated his estate right, and intended
   to reserve any part of it to himself, which is but reasonable to
   suppose, it could be no very great part of his estate which was so
   injuriously got: and I am afraid a far smaller proportion than many are
   guilty of, who yet pass for very honest men in comparison of the
   publicans. The text saith, he was "a rich man." Suppose he was worth
   ten or twelve thousand pounds; half he gives to the poor, that was well
   got, or else his whole estate could not have made a fourfold
   restitution for it. Suppose he reserved a thousand or two to himself;
   then, at the rate of restoring fourfold, not above a thousand can be
   injuriously got; that is, about a penny in the shilling. I am afraid
   that now-a-days there are few such moderate oppressors: nay, it is
   possible that the proportion of his estate injuriously got might be
   much less; more it could not easily be. But whatever it was, he does
   not plead that by way of excuse for himself; he freely confesseth he
   had sinned in this kind, and offers restitution to the utmost, much
   more than the law did require in such cases.

   II. You have the declaration our Saviour makes hereupon, of the truth
   of his repentance and conversion, and the happy state he was thereby
   put into, "This day is salvation come to this house."

   The observation I shall make from hence is this, that restitution and
   satisfaction for the injuries we have done to others, is a proper and
   genuine effect of true repentance. I know the text only speaks of
   restitution in case of oppression and exaction: but, because there is
   the same reason why restitution should be made for all other injuries,
   I think I may, without any force or violence to my text, very well make
   it the foundation of a more general discourse concerning restitution.

   In handling of this, I shall,

   First, Open to you the nature of this duty.

   Secondly, Confirm the truth of the proposition, by shewing the
   necessity of it.

   Thirdly, Endeavour to persuade men to the discharge of this necessary
   duty.

   First, For the opening the nature of this duty, I will consider,

   I. The act.

   II. The latitude or extent of the object, as I may call it, or the
   matter about which it is conversant.

   III. The manner how it is to be done.

   IV. The measure of it.

   V. The persons who are bound to make restitution, and to whom it is to
   be made.

   VI. The time in which it is to be done.

   VII. The order of doing it, where more are injured, and restitution
   cannot be made at once to all.

   I. For the act. Restitution is nothing else but the making reparation
   or satisfaction to another for the injuries we have done him. It is to
   restore a man to the good condition from which, contrary to right and
   to our duty, we have removed him. Restitution is only done in case of
   injury. Another man may be damaged and prejudiced by us many ways, and
   we not be bound to make restitution: because there are many cases
   wherein a man deserves the prejudice we do to him: as, when we are
   instruments of inflicting upon a man the punishment which the law doth
   sentence him to. And there are many cases wherein we may be prejudicial
   to others, and cannot help it: as a man that is sick of a contagious
   disease, may infect others that are about him: but he is not injurious
   to them; because it is not his fault but his infelicity.

   II. For the latitude and extent of the object, as I may call it, or the
   matter about which it is conversant. It extends to all kind of
   injuries, which may be reduced to these two heads; either we injure a
   person with or without his consent.

   1. Some injuries are done to persons with their consent. Such are most
   of those injuries which are done to the souls of men, when we command,
   or counsel, or encourage them to sin, or draw them in by our example.
   For the maxim, Volenti non fit injuria, "There is no injury done to a
   man that is willing," is not so to be understood, as that a man may not
   in some sort consent to his own wrong: for absolute freedom and
   willingness supposeth that a man is wholly left to himself, and that he
   under stands fully what he does. And in this sense no man sins
   willingly; that is, perfectly knowing and actually considering what he
   does; and commands, and persuasion, and example, are a kind of
   violence; yet none of these hinder, but that a man in these cases may
   sufficiently consent to what he does. But yet he is not so perfectly
   free, as to excuse him that draws him into sin by these ways. So
   likewise when a man refuseth to do that which is his duty without a
   reward; for instance, to do justice to another; he is injurious in so
   doing: but yet not altogether without the consent of him whom he
   injures.

   2. Injuries are done to persons without their consent. And these,
   though they are not always the greatest mischiefs, yet they are the
   greatest injuries. And these injuries are done either by fraud and
   cunning, or by violence and oppression: either by overreaching another
   man in wit, or overbearing him by power. And these usually either
   respect the bodies of men, or their estates, or their good name. The
   bodies of men: he that maims another, or does him any other injury in
   his limbs or health, either by fraud or by force, is bound, so far as
   he is able, to make reparation for the injury. Or they respect the
   estates of men: if by cunning, or by violence, or by false testimony,
   or accusation, thou hast hindered a man of any benefit, which otherwise
   would have come to him, thou art bound to restitution. If by thy power
   or interest, by thy knowledge in the law, or skill in business, thou
   hast directly and avowedly helped and assisted another to do injustice
   to his neighbour, thou art bound to restitution; though not as the
   principal, yet as the accessory. If thou hast overreached thy brother
   in any contract, making advantage of his ignorance or unskilfulness; if
   thou hast made again of his necessity; if thou hast by thy power and
   interest, or by any more violent and forcible way detained his right,
   or taken away that which was his, thou art bound to make reparation for
   these injuries, to restore that which thou hast borrowed, to return the
   pledge which thou hast wrongfully kept, to release unconscionable
   forfeitures, to pay debts, to make satisfaction for frauds and cheats,
   to take off all unjust invasions and surprisals of estates: yea, though
   the fraud be such that thou art not liable to make satisfaction by any
   human law; yet thou art as much bound to it in conscience to God and
   thy duty, as if thou hadst stolen or taken it by violence from thy
   neighbour. For in truth and reality, fraud is as great an injury as
   violence, although human laws cannot take cognizance of it, so as to
   relieve every man that is over reached in a bargain: nay, of the two,
   it is worse; for whenever thou deceivest a man in this kind, thou dost
   not only wrong him in point of estate, but thou abusest his
   understanding.

   And so likewise in respect of a man's fame and reputation. If thou hast
   hurt any man's good name by slander or calumny, by false witness, by
   rendering him ridiculous, or any other way, thou art bound to give such
   satisfaction as the thing is capable of; or if there be any other
   injury which I have not mentioned, thou art obliged to make reparation
   for it.

   III. As to the manner how restitution is to be made,

   1. Thou art bound to do it voluntarily, and of thy own accord, though
   the person injured do not know who it was that did him the injury,
   though he do not seek reparation by law. When a man is forced by law to
   make restitution, it is not a virtue, but necessity; this is not a
   fruit of repentance and a good mind, but of good law. And that thou
   dost not do it, unless the law compel thee to it, is an argument thou
   wouldest not have done it, if thou couldest have avoided it. And though
   the thing be done, yet thou hast not done it, but the law; and unless
   thou heartily repent of thy crime, the injury still lies at thy door,
   and in God's account thou art as guilty as if no restitution had been
   made. Not that thou art bound, in this case, to make new restitution
   over again; but thou art bound to bewail thy neglect, that thou didst
   not do it voluntarily, and without the compulsion of the law.

   2. Thou must do it in kind, if the thing be capable of it, and the
   injured party demand it. Thou must restore the very thing which thou
   hadst deprived thy neighbour of, if it be such a thing as can be
   restored, and be still in thy power, unless he voluntarily accept of
   some other thing in exchange.

   3. If thou canst not restore it in kind, thou art bound to restore it
   in value, in something that is as good. As for spiritual injuries done
   to the souls of men, we are bound to make such reparation and
   compensation as we can. Those whom we have drawn into sin, and engaged
   in wicked courses, by our influence and example, or by neglect of our
   duty towards them, we are, so far as becomes the relation we stand in
   to them, to make acknowledgment of our fault, to endeavour by our
   instruction and counsel to reclaim them from those sins we led them
   into, and "to recover them out of the snare of the devil;" and should
   never be at rest till we have done as much, or more, for the
   furtherance of their salvation, and helping them forwards towards
   heaven, as we did contribute before to their ruin and destruction. If
   we have violated any one's chastity, we are bound to marry them, if it
   was done upon that condition, and if they require it; thou art bound to
   keep and maintain those children which are the fruit of thy lust, and
   to make reparation to the person whom thou hast injured, by dowry or
   otherwise.

   If thou hast defrauded and injured any man in his good name, thou art
   obliged to make him a compensation by acknowledgment of thy fault, by a
   studious vindication of him, and by doing him honour, and repairing his
   credit in all fitting ways. And if the injury be irreparable (as it
   frequently happens, that we can hardly so effectually vindicate a man,
   as we can defame him; and it is seldom seen that those wounds which are
   given to men's reputation are perfectly healed), I say, if the injury
   be irreparable, especially if it prove really prejudicial to a man in
   his calling and civil interest; if no other satisfaction will be
   accepted, it is to be made in money, which, Solomon says, "answers all
   things;" and the rather, because the reason and equity of human laws
   hath thought fit to assign this way of satisfaction in many cases upon
   actions of scandal and defamation. And whatever the law would give, in
   any case, if it could be proved, that is the least we are bound in
   conscience to do, when we are guilty to ourselves, though the law
   cannot take hold of us.

   So likewise, if thou hast wounded a man, thou art bound to pay the
   cure, to repair to him and his relations the disability for his
   calling, and his way of livelihood and subsistence, which he hath
   contracted by thy injury. And so for false imprisonment, the real
   detriment which comes to him by it, is to be made amends for: and so,
   in all other cases, the injured person is, so far as is possible, to be
   restored to the good condition in which he was before the injury.

   IV. As to the measure and proportion of the restitution we are to make.
   Zaccheus here offers fourfold, which was much beyond what any law
   required in like cases. The measure of restitution by the judicial law
   of the Jews, did very much vary, according to the kind and degree of
   the injury. In some cases, a man was only bound to simple restitution;
   but then he was to do it to the full, (Exod. xxii. 5, 6.) And so if
   that which is another man's be "delivered unto his neighbour to keep,
   and be stolen from him, he is to make restitution thereof," (ver. 12.)
   "And so if a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt or die,
   the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make it good,"
   (ver. 14.) "But for all manner of trespasses," by way of theft,
   "whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any
   manner of lost thing, which another challengeth to be his, he whom the
   judge shall condemn, shall pay double to his neighbour;" (ver. 9.) that
   is, if it be of a living creature, "if the theft be found in his hands
   alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall restore double,"
   (ver. 4.) But if a man did "steal an ox or a sheep, and did kill it, or
   sell it," he was to restore "five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
   sheep." And thus we find David judged upon Nathan's parable of the rich
   man, who had taken the poor man's only lamb, and killed and dressed it
   for a traveller that came to him, (2 Sam. xii. 6.) "He shall restore
   the lamb fourfold." Now the reason of this seems to be partly because
   of the advantage and usefulness of those creatures above any other: and
   partly because when they were once killed or alienated, a man could
   not, without great trouble and difficulty, make discovery; which hazard
   of not discovering seems to be accounted for in the restitution; but if
   a man did voluntarily offer restitution, before he was prosecuted, for
   any thing that was taken by violence, or unjustly detained from his
   neighbour, then he was only "to restore the principal, and to add a
   fifth part thereto, and to offer up an offering to the Lord," and so
   "his atonement was made," (Levit. vi. 1, &c.)

   So that the highest proportion was a fourth or fifth part, and that
   only in the particular case of sheep or oxen stolen away, and killed or
   alienated afterwards. Indeed, Solomon speaks of a sevenfold
   restitution, (Prov. vi. 31.) where he saith, "If a thief be found, he
   shall restore sevenfold, even all the substance of his house;" where
   seven is only a number of perfection, and the meaning is, he shall make
   perfect and full restitution, according to the law, so far as his
   substance or estate will reach.

   So that it seems Zaccheus, in restoring fourfold, did outdo the utmost
   severity of the law; which in case of fraud and oppression was but
   double, if demanded; if voluntarily offered, was the principal, and a
   fifth part added; but to testify the truth of his repentance, and his
   hearty sorrow for the injuries he had done, he punisheth himself beyond
   what the law would have done.

   I do not say that this example binds as to this measure and proportion:
   nay, I do not say we are bound to the proportions of the law; for that
   only concerned the nation of the Jews: but although we be free from the
   letter of the law, yet we are tied to the equity of it. As to the
   substance of the duty of restitution, we are bound to that by the law
   of nature: as to the measure and proportion, the equity of the judicial
   law in its proportions, and of Zaccheus's example, ought to be
   considerable to us.

   But to speak more particularly concerning the measures and proportions
   of restitution, I shall lay down these propositions:

   I. Where restitution can be made in kind, or the injury can be
   certainly valued, we are to restore the tiling or the value.

   2. We are bound to restore the thing, with the natural increase of it;
   that is, to satisfy for the loss sustained in the mean time, and the
   gain hindered.

   3. Where the thing cannot be restored, and the value of it is not
   certain, we are to give reasonable satisfaction, that is, according to
   a middle estimation; not the highest nor the lowest of things of the
   kind. The injured person can demand no more, and strict justice
   requires no more. But it is safe for him that hath done the injury,
   rather to exceed than to fall short.

   4. We are at least to give by way of restitution what the law would
   give, for that is generally equal, and in most cases rather favourable
   than rigorous.

   5. A man is not only bound to restitution for the injury which he did,
   but for all that directly follows upon his injurious act, though it
   were beyond his intention. For the first injury being wilful, thou art
   presumed to will all that which directly followed upon it, according to
   that rule, Involuntarium ortum ex voluntaria censetur pro voluntario:
   "We are presumed to will that which follows upon a voluntary action,
   though we did not intend it." For instance, if a man maliciously and
   knowingly set fire upon another man's house, though he intended only an
   injury to that particular person, yet if a wind come and drive the fire
   to his neighbours at some distance, though he did not intend this, yet,
   because the first act was unlawful, he is liable to satisfy for all the
   direct consequences of it. If a man wound another without any intention
   of killing him, and the wound prove mortal, though there was no
   probability that death would ensue upon it, the man is bound, because
   the first act was injurious, to make reparation to his relations for
   the damage they sustain by his death; and if they did depend solely
   upon him who died by such injury, thou art bound to maintain them.

   6. Because those who have lived in a trade and course of injustice can
   hardly remember all the particular injuries they have done, so as to
   make exact satisfaction! for them, it will not be amiss, over and
   besides, to give something to the poor. So Zaccheus does here, "Half of
   my estate I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing," &c.

   V. The persons who are concerned in restitution. And here I shall
   consider,

   First, The persons who are bound to make restitution.

   Secondly, The persons to whom it is to be made.

   First, The persons who are bound to make restitution. In general, they
   who have done the injury, or they who come into their stead, so as in
   law or equity the injury devolves and descends upon them. But for the
   clearer stating of this, I shall lay down several propositions which
   may serve to resolve a great many cases that may be put concerning
   persons obliged to make restitution.

   1. If the injury be done solely by one, without accomplices and
   partakers in the crime, he alone is responsible, and wholly bound to
   make satisfaction; I mean, he only is bound so long as he lives; but if
   the injury descends as a burthen upon the estate, then he who enjoys
   the estate becomes bound to make satisfaction, as I shall shew
   afterwards.

   2. If the injury was done by more, who did all equally concur to the
   doing of it, they are all equally bound to make satisfaction, and they
   are bound to concur together to that purpose; and in case of such
   concurrence, every one is not bound to satisfy for the whole, but pro
   rata parte, for his share; provided they do among them make full
   satisfaction.

   3. If all will not concur, those that are willing are bound among them
   to make reparation for the injury: nay, if all the rest refuse to join
   with thee in it, thou art bound in solidum to make full reparation so
   far as thou art able; because every one was guilty of the whole injury.
   For instance, if four men conspire together to cheat a man, or to rob
   him, any one of these, if the rest refuse, is bound to make entire
   satisfaction; yea, though he was only partaker in the benefit; because,
   as I said before, he is guilty of the whole injury.

   4. If the injury be done by more, who do unequally concur to the doing
   of it, he that is principal is chiefly and principally bound to make
   satisfaction; and here I do not take principal strictly in the sense of
   the law, but in the sense of equity; not for him always who is the more
   immediate cause of the injury, but for him who was the greatest cause,
   and by whose influence chiefly it was procured and done: but if the
   principal will not, the accessories and instruments are bound, at least
   for their share, and according to the proportion of the hand they had
   in it. But if the principal do satisfy in the name, and upon the
   account of the rest, then the accessories are free from an obligation
   to restitution, and are only bound to repentance.

   5. If the injury devolve upon another, by descending as a burden upon
   the estate, he who enjoys the estate is bound to make satisfaction. And
   when injuries do thus descend as burdens and incumbrances upon estates,
   and when not, the civil laws of the place where we live must determine:
   but then where my case falls within the compass of the law, I am bound
   voluntarily to satisfy without the compulsion of the law. For instance,
   if an estate fall to me charged with a debt, which hath been unjustly
   detained, I am bound voluntarily to discharge the debt, so soon as it
   appears to me, before I am compelled thereto by the law.

   6. As for personal injuries which do not lie as burdens upon the
   estate, nor do by the law descend upon the son or heir, though in
   strict justice a man be not bound to make compensation for them, for
   that would be endless, et infinitum in lege repudiatur, "no law can
   take notice of that which is in finite and endless;" for quæ exitum non
   habent habentur pro impossibilibus, "those things which have no end, to
   which no bounds can be set, are esteemed among things impossible," to
   which no man can be obliged: but though in strict justice the heir be
   not bound to make reparation for the personal injuries of him whom he
   succeeds in the estate, yet in many cases it is equitable, and
   generous, and Christian, for such persons to make some kind of
   reparation for palpable and notorious injuries. For instance, if I be
   heir to an estate, part of which I know certainly was injuriously
   gotten, it is not only Christian, but prudent, to make satisfaction in
   the case to the party injured, if certainly known; if not, to give it
   to the poor; for by this means I may take out the moth which was bred
   by injustice in the estate, and rub off the rust that sticks to the
   gold and silver which was got by oppression or fraud, and so free the
   remaining part of the estate from that secret and Divine Nemesis which
   attends it and follows it. And for the same reason, it is very noble
   and Christian for the son and heir of an unjust father to make some
   reparation for his father's injuries by restitution, if the thing be
   capable of it: if not, by doing all good offices to the injured
   persons, which is some kind of compensation. And in this case the
   obligation is greater, because by this means a man does not only do
   what in him lies to cutoff the curse, which, by his father's oppression
   and injustice, is entailed upon the family and estate; but, likewise,
   because a son ought much more to be concerned for his father than any
   other person, and to consult the honour and reputation both of him and
   his own family; and the reparation which the son makes, is in some sort
   the father's act, because he succeeds him, and comes in his stead.

   Secondly, As to the persons to whom satisfaction is to be made. For the
   resolution of those cases which may fall under this head, I shall lay
   down these propositions:

   1. If the injured person be certainly known, and be alive and extant,
   the satisfaction is to be made to him.

   2. If he be not alive, or, which is all one, not to be found or come
   at, satisfaction is to be made to his nearest relations, his wife, or
   children, or brothers, or other nearest kindred. The reason is, because
   satisfaction being due, and I having no right to keep that which I have
   injuriously gotten, if I cannot restore it to the party himself, I
   ought in all reason to place it there where I may most reasonably
   presume the party injured would have bestowed his estate, and this part
   of it amongst the rest, had he been possessed of it. And by the same
   reason that I am bound thus to restore the part of his estate which I
   have injuriously taken or detained from him, I am likewise obliged to
   give satisfaction to the same person for any other injury; for to whom
   soever I would pay a debt due to one that is deceased, to the same
   person I ought to give satisfaction for the injuries by which a debt
   is, though not formally, yet virtually contracted.

   3. If the party injured be not certainly known, or have no near
   relations known to me, in that case I think it very advisable to give
   so much to the poor, or to some charitable use; or if the party injured
   be not capable of proper satisfaction, as sometimes it is a community
   and body of men that you have injured; in this case it is proper to
   repair the injuries to communities or bodies of men, by equivalent good
   offices, or by some public good work, which may be of common benefit
   and advantage.--This is the fifth thing I proposed to speak to, the
   persons concerned in restitution; both the persons who are bound to
   make restitution, and the persons to whom it is to be made. Of the rest
   hereafter.

SERMON CLXX.

  THE NATURE AND NECESSITY OF RESTITUTION.

   And if I have taken any tiling from any man by false accusation, I
   restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation
   come to this house.--Luke xix. 8, 9.

   IN speaking to these words, I proposed to consider,

   First, The nature of this duty of restitution.

   Secondly, To shew the necessity of it.

   Thirdly, To persuade men to the discharge of it.

   In treating of the nature of restitution, I have considered,

   I. The act.

   II. The extent of it.

   III. The manner how it is to be performed.

   IV. The measure of it.

   V. The persons who are to make restitution; and the persons to whom
   restitution is to be made. I now proceed to consider,

   VI. The time when restitution is to be made. In these cases a man is
   not tied up to an instant, not just to the present time, unless the
   case be such that he can never do it, if he do not do it then. As, if a
   man lie upon his death-bed; that is a case that admits of no delay, a
   man should hasten restitution, as he would do the making of his will,
   and the disposal of his estate; lest, if he do not do it presently, he
   lose his opportunity of doing it for ever; but ordinarily, a man is not
   so strictly tied up to moments, and to the present time. It is
   sufficient that a man be for the present resolved to do it so soon as
   morally he can, so soon as he would do other actions of great moment
   and concernment. And to this purpose the text gives us an excellent
   pattern; Zaccheus the same day he repented took up this resolution, and
   to oblige himself effectually to put it in execution he publicly
   declares it, and before all the people offers to make restitution to
   all whom he had injured.

   Therefore take heed of all unnecessary delays in these matters: for
   though God would accept of a firm and sincere resolution in this case,
   if a person thus resolved should, before he could bring his resolution
   to effect, happen to be cut off by death, or be otherwise rendered
   incapable of doing it; I say, though God would accept such a resolution
   as this, yet he will not interpret that to be a sincere resolution
   which a man is negligent to put in practice; for every neglect of
   putting our resolution in practice, is a degree of quitting and
   altering it; and he who did not do what he was resolved to do, when he
   had an opportunity and ability of doing it, is justly presumed to have
   let fall his resolution.

   Therefore, let no man presume upon his good intention and resolution in
   this kind; for they are only acceptable to God so far as they are
   sincere and real; and they are only so far sincere and real, as the man
   that makes them is ready to put them in execution so soon as morally he
   can. And if thou carelessly and supinely trifle away thy opportunities
   in this kind, God may likewise deprive thee of an opportunity forever.
   For all the while thou wilfully neglectest to make restitution, thou
   art guilty of the injury; and there are hardly two sins that cry louder
   to God for a quick and speedy revenge, than injustice and oppression,
   deceit and fraud. God many times takes such causes into his more
   immediate cognizance: (1 Thess. iv. 6.) "Let no man deceive or go
   beyond his brother in any thing: for God is the avenger of such." And
   David tells us, that God, in a peculiar manner, "abhors the blood
   thirsty and deceitful man;" and threatens that "he shall not live out
   half his days." And God, by the prophet, (Mal. iii. 5.) tells us, that
   "he will be a swift witness against the oppressors." And if God be so
   swift to take vengeance upon such persons, surely then they are
   concerned to be very quick and speedy in making satisfaction for their
   injuries and oppressions, lest Divine vengeance prevent them, and
   instead of making reparation to men, they be called upon to make
   satisfaction to the justice of God; and you know who hath said it, that
   "it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."

   You, therefore, that have hitherto neglected this duty, delay it no
   longer; by all means discharge your consciences of this burden, before
   you come to lie upon a death-bed. Then the consciences of the worst of
   men begin to work, like a stomach oppressed and surcharged with meat;
   and then they are willing for their ease to vomit up those estates
   which they have devoured by fraud and injustice; then they begin to
   consider the difficulty of being saved, and to fear that it will be
   impossible for them ever "to enter in at the strait gate," thus laden
   with the spoils of violence and deceit; even those that have the
   hardest and most seared consciences, will be touched with the sense of
   such great sins at such a time; but do not thou defer this work to that
   time, for these two reasons:

   1. Because it cannot be so acceptable to God, to make restitution at
   such a time, as when thou art in health, and in hopes of longer life.
   To give a man his own, when thou canst enjoy it and use it no longer,
   this is next to detaining of it.

   2. Because in all probability the restitution which is then made will
   not prove so effectual. What thou dost thyself, that thou art sure is
   done: but what thou leavest to be done by thy executors, and chargest
   upon them, thou art not sure will be done; ten to one but if they can
   find out any trick and evasion in law, either to delay or avoid the
   doing of it, it shall either never be done, or very slowly. This is the
   sixth thing, the time when restitution is to be made.

   But before I leave this head, there is one case very proper to be
   considered, which relates to this circumstance of time, and that is
   concerning injuries of a very ancient date; that is, how far this duty
   of restitution is to look backward, and whether it doth not expire by
   tract of time? For answer to this, I shall lay down these propositions:

   1. At what distance of time soever the law would in the case make
   reparation and give satisfaction, we are undoubtedly bound in
   conscience voluntarily to give it. I deliver this generally, because,
   though it be possible some civil laws may be in some cases unreasonable
   in this matter, yet they are our best rule and guide; and, speaking
   generally, and for the most part, they are as equitable as the reason
   of man could devise. Not that we are to tie ourselves strictly to the
   law, so as not to go farther, if reason and equity require; for, as
   Seneca says, Parum est ad legem bonum esse, "It is no great argument of
   goodness, to be just as good as the law requires." Therefore I think it
   will very well become a good man, in many cases, rather to be better
   than the law, than to keep strictly to it.

   2. In cases where the law hath not determined the time, we may do well
   to observe a proportion to what the law hath determined in other cases,
   which come nearest our own case.

   3. When the injury is so old, that the right which the injured person
   had to reparation is reasonably presumed to be quitted and forsaken,
   then the obligation to satisfaction ceaseth and expires. The reason is
   plain, because every man may recede from his own right, and give it up
   to another: and where a man may reasonably be presumed to have parted
   with his right to another, the obligation to restitution ceaseth, and
   the right of claiming it. Now when a thing begins haberi pro derelicto,
   that is, when a right may reasonably be presumed to be quitted and
   forsaken, cannot in general be deter mined: but this must be estimated
   according to the importance of the right and thing in controversy, as
   whether it be more or less considerable; and according to the reason
   and determination of laws about things of this nature. To illustrate
   this rule by instances:--the Saxons, Danes, and Normans, did at several
   times invade and conquer this nation, and conquered it, we will
   suppose, unjustly, and consequently did hold and possess that which
   truly belonged to others, contrary to right; and several of the
   posterity of each of these do probably to this day hold what was then
   injuriously gotten; I say, in this case, the obligation to satisfaction
   and restitution is long since expired, and the original title which
   those who were dispossessed had, is reasonably presumed to be long
   since quitted and forsaken: and that for very wise reasons in law and
   government; because it would confound and unsettle all estates, if
   every thing, the original title whereof is nought, were to be restored;
   and it is but equal to presume, that all mankind are so reasonable as
   to quit their right in such cases, rather than to cause endless
   disturbances, and to have the guilt of in justice everlastingly
   perpetuated. And though it be a rule in civil law, that Vitiosum
   initio, tractu temporis non convalescit, "A title originally bad, can
   never by time be made just;" it is only true thus far, that time in
   itself doth not alter the nature of things; but, considering the
   necessities of the world, and the infinite difficulties of retrieving
   an ancient right, and the inconveniences and disturbances that would
   thereby redound to human society, it is better that an injury should be
   perpetuated, than that a great inconveniency should come by
   endeavouring to redress it; so that, although, considering a thing
   simply in itself, an injury is so far from being lessened or nulled by
   tract of time, that it is increased, and the longer it continues, the
   greater it is; yet, by accident, and in compliance with the necessity
   of things, length of time may give a right to that which was at first
   injuriously possessed. (Judg. xi. 26.) Thus Jephthah reasons with the
   king of Ammon, who had made war for recovery of an ancient right, as he
   supposed. And though the instances I have given of the unjust conquest
   of a nation be great and public; yet the same is to be determined
   proportionably in less and particular cases. And thus I have done with
   the sixth thing.

   VII. And lastly, As to the order of restitution. When we have injured a
   great many, and are not able to make restitution to all at once, our
   best prudence and discretion must govern us herein. Be cause no certain
   rule can be given, which will reach all cases, I will only say this in
   general, that it is reasonable first to make reparation for the oldest
   and greatest injuries; and, cæteris paribus, if all other
   considerations be equal, to consider those first who are most
   necessitous, and if there be any other special reason and obligation
   arising from the nature of the injury, or the circumstances of the
   person injured, to have regard to them. I come now, in the

   Second place, To confirm the truth of the proposition, that to make
   restitution and satisfaction to those whom we have injured, is a proper
   and necessary fruit of a true repentance. And this will appear if we
   consider these two things:

   I. Our obligation to this duty.

   II. The nature of repentance.

   I. Our obligation to this duty. Upon the same account that we are
   obliged to repentance, we are obliged to restitution; and both these
   obligations arise from natural equity and justice. All sin is an injury
   done; and though repentance be not strictly satisfaction, yet it is the
   best we can make; and he is unjust, who, having done an injury, does
   not make the best reparation he can. But now there are some sins, in
   which, besides the injury that is done to God by them, upon the general
   account, as they are sins and violations of his laws, there is likewise
   a particular injury done to men; and such are all those, the effect
   whereof redounds to the prejudice of other men: such are fraud and
   oppression, and all other sins whereby others are injured. So that in
   these kind of sins, there are two things considerable, the irregularity
   and viciousness of the act, and the evil effects of it upon other men;
   the former respects the law, and calls for sorrow and repentance for
   our violation of it; the latter respects the person that is injured,
   and calls for satisfaction and restitution. So that our obligation to
   restitution is founded in the immutable and indispensable law of
   nature, which is--to do that to another which we would have another do
   to us. We would have no man be injurious to us, or if he hath been so,
   we would have him make satisfaction and reparation to us of the injury
   he hath done; and we take it grievously from him if he do not. Now
   nothing is more just and equitable, than that we should do that to
   others which we, in like case, would expect from them: for the very
   same obligation that lies upon others towards us, does lie upon us in
   regard to others.

   II. This will yet further appear, if we consider the nature of
   repentance, which is to be sorry for what we have done, and not to do
   the like for the future. Now if thou be sorry for what thou hast done,
   thou wishest with all thy heart thou hadst not done it; and if thou
   dost so, thou wilt undo, as much as in thee lieth, what thou hast done.
   Now the best way to undo an injury, is to make reparation for it; and
   till we do this, we continue in the sin. For if it was a sin to do the
   injury at first, it is the same continued, not to make satisfaction;
   and we do not cease to commit the sin, so long as we detain that which
   is another's right. Nothing but restitution can stop the progress of
   sin; for if it be a sin to take that which is another man's from him by
   fraud and violence, it is the same continued and virtually repeated, to
   detain and keep it from him; and nothing more contrary to repentance,
   than to continue in the sin thou pretendest to repent of. For how art
   thou sorry for doing of it, if thou continuest to do it, if thou wilt
   go on to do it, and do, it again? How dost thou hate thy sin, if thou
   enjoy the benefit and reap the advantage of it? If thou dost this, it
   is an argument thou lovest thy sin still: for thou didst never love it
   for itself, but for the profit of it; and so long as thou retainest
   that, thou canst not be quit of the sin. Thou boldest fast thy sin so
   long as thou refusest to make satisfaction for it; and repentance
   without restitution differs as much from true repentance, as
   continuance in sin does from the forsaking of it. Si res aliena non
   redditur, non agitur poenitentia, sed fingitur; so St. Augustine; "If
   we do not restore that which we have injuriously detained from another,
   our repentance is not real, but feigned and hypocritical," and will not
   be effectual to the obtaining of our pardon. It is a very common, but a
   true and terrible saying, Non demittitur peccatum, nisi restituatur
   ablatum: "No remission without restitution." If we will inherit the
   profit and advantage of sin, we cannot think it unreasonable or unjust
   that we should inherit the punishment of it.

   When the Scripture speaks of repentance, it frequently mentions
   restitution as a proper fruit and effect of it, and as a necessary and
   indispensable condition of pardon and life. (Ezek. xxxiii. 14-16.)
   "Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: if he turn
   from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; if the wicked
   restore the pledge, give again that he hath robbed," &c. As if he had
   said, when I denounce death and destruction to the wicked, there is but
   this one way to escape it, and that is, by repentance; but then take
   notice what a repentance it is that will avail to this end; it is not a
   bewailing ourselves, and lamenting over our sins, but a forsaking of
   them, and returning to our duty; "If we turn from our sin, and do that
   which is lawful and right." For instance, if he hath been guilty of
   injustice and oppression; if he leave his course, and deal justly and
   righteously with his neighbour, and not only so, but he also make
   restitution for the injury he hath done, and restore what he hath
   unjustly detained and taken away; "If he restore the pledge, and give
   again that he hath robbed," and do no injustice for the future, but
   "walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity;" upon these
   terms, and no other, "he shall live; he shall not die." Yea, the very
   light of nature could suggest thus much to the people of Nineveh, that
   there was no hope, without this fruit of repentance, of appeasing God's
   wrath. Therefore the king and the princes, after all the external
   solemnity of fasting and sackcloth, and crying mightily, they decree
   that "Every one should return from the evil of his ways, and from the
   violence that was in their hands;" ut rapina manus vacuefactat, et
   rapta restituat, sine quo non est vera poenitentia; so Grotius upon the
   place, "That he empty his hands of the spoils of rapine and
   oppression;" that is, "that he make restitution, without which there
   can be no repentance:" and upon their doing this, it is said that God
   spared them, (Jonah iii. 10.) "And God saw their works, that they
   turned from their evil ways." It is not said, that he saw their fasting
   and sackcloth, but he saw their works, thereat fruits and effects of
   their repentance; and upon this it was that "God repented of the evil
   he said he would do to them, and he did it not." And elsewhere we find,
   that God speaks with great indignation of the most solemn repentance
   which is not accompanied with this fruit: (Isa. lviii. 3-6.) the people
   tell God how they had fasted and afflicted their soul, and made their
   voice to be heard on high: but God despiseth all this, because it was
   not accompanied with this fruit of repentance: "Is it such a fast as I
   have chosen?" &c. There is so much of natural justice and equity in
   restitution, and it is so proper a fruit of repentance, that, as
   Grotius observes, it is not only the doctrine of the Jews and
   Christians, but of heathens and Mahometans, that the repentance which
   does not produce this fruit, is feigned, and will never avail with God
   for pardon and mercy. Thus much for confirmation of this doctrine.

   The third and last thing I proposed was, to persuade to the practice of
   this duty; and this may serve by way of application of the doctrine of
   restitution. The use we make of it is,

   First, To persuade men to the practice of this difficult duty. I doubt
   not but the arguments I have used are sufficient to convince us of the
   equity and necessity of restitution; but what arguments shall I use to
   persuade to the practice and exercise of it? When we press men to their
   duty, though we have some advantages on our side, yet we have also
   great disadvantages. We have this advantage, that we have the reason
   and consciences of men on our side; but then we have this disadvantage,
   that we have to contend either with the lusts or interests of men, or
   both: now that these are usually more powerful, is evident in that the
   lusts and interests of men do so frequently bias and draw them to do
   things contrary to reason and conscience. When we persuade men to be
   just, and to make restitution to those whom they have injured, it is
   true we have not to contend with the lusts of men, with any corrupt and
   vicious inclination of nature. There are some sins that have their rise
   from men's natural tempers, as passion and lust, and those sensual
   vices that abound in the world: but there is nothing in any man's
   natural temper and disposition that inclines him to be unjust, no man's
   complexion doth particularly dispose him to lie or steal, to defraud
   his neighbour, or detain his right from him; it is only the interests
   of men that prompt them to these things; and they are upon this account
   the more inexcusable, because no man is inclined to these sins from
   particular temper and constitution: so that an unjust man is in
   ordinary cases and circum stances a greater sinner, than a drunkard or
   a lustful man, because no man can pretend to be hurried away by the
   strong propension and inclination of his nature to cheat his brother;
   but al though, when we persuade men to be just, we have not the lusts
   of men to contend withal, yet we have another powerful adversary, and
   that is the interests of men, which is one of the chief "rulers and
   governors of this world;" so that when we press men to restitution, we
   touch them in their interest, which is a very touchy and tender thing;
   when we tell them that without restitution no man can repent and be
   saved, they think this to be a very hard saying, and they know not how
   to bear it.

   But certainly it hath all the reason and equity in the world on its
   side. If it be so hard for them to restore that which is another man's,
   is it not much harder for him whom thou hast injured, to lose that
   which is his own? make it thine own case; wouldest thou not think it
   much harder to have thy right detained from thee by another, than for
   another to part with that which is not his own?

   But I am sensible how little it is that reason will sway with men
   against their interest; therefore the best argument that I can use,
   will be to satisfy men that, upon a true and just account, it is not so
   much their interest to retain what they have unjustly got, as to make
   restitution. And this I shall do, by shewing men that to make
   restitution is their true interest, both in respect of themselves and
   of their posterity.

   I. In respect to themselves. It is better both in respect of our
   present condition in this world, and of our future state,

   1. In respect of our present condition in this world, and that both in
   respect of our outward estate, and our inward peace and tranquillity.

   (1.) In respect of our outward estate. If we have any belief of the
   providence of God, that his blessing can prosper an estate, and his
   curse consume it and make it moulder away, we cannot but judge it
   highly our interest to clear our estates of injustice by restitution;
   and by this means to free them from God's curse. For if any of our
   estate be unjustly gotten, it is enough to draw down God's curse upon
   all that we have; it is like a moth in our estate, which will
   insensibly consume it; it is like a secret poison, which will diffuse
   itself through the whole; like a little land in capite, which brings
   the whole estate into wardship.

   Hear how God threatens to blast estates unjustly gotten, (Job xx. 12,
   &c.) concluding with these words, "This is the portion of a wicked
   man;" that is, of an unjust man. (Jer. xvii. 11.) "As a partridge
   sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not, so he that getteth riches and
   not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end
   shall be a fool." Men many times live to see the folly of their
   injustice and oppression, and their estates wither away before their
   eyes: and by the just revenge of God, they are deprived of them in the
   midst of their days. So that the best way to fix an estate, and to
   secure it to ourselves, is by restitution to free it from God's curse;
   and when we have done that, how much soever we may diminish our estate
   by it, we may look upon ourselves as having a better estate than we
   had; better, because we have God's blessing with that which remains. If
   we believe the Bible, we cannot doubt of this. The Spirit of God tells
   us this from the observation of the wisest men. (Psal. xxxvii. 16.) "A
   little that a righteous man hath, is better than the riches of many
   wicked." (Prov. xvi. 8.) "Better is a little with righteousness, than
   great revenues without right."

   (2.) In respect of inward peace and tranquillity, it is highly our
   interest to make restitution. No man can enjoy an estate, that does not
   enjoy himself; and nothing puts a man more out of the possession of
   himself, than an unquiet conscience; and there are no kind of sins lie
   heavier upon a man's conscience, than those of injustice; because they
   are committed against the clearest natural light, and there is the
   least natural temptation to them. They have these two great
   aggravations, that they are sins most against knowledge, and have most
   of will in them. There needs no revelation to convince men of sins of
   injustice and oppression; every man hath those principles born with
   him, which will sufficiently acquaint him that he ought not to be
   injurious to another. There is nothing that relates to our duty, that a
   man can know with greater certainty than this, that injustice is a sin.
   And as it is a sin most against knowledge, so it hath most of will in
   it. are hurried away to other sins by the strong and violent
   propensions of their nature: but no man is inclined, by his temper and
   constitution, to fraud and oppression: and the less there is of nature
   in any sin, there is the less of necessity, and consequently it is the
   more voluntary. Now the greater the aggravations of any sin are, the
   greater is the guilt; and the greater the guilt is, the more unquiet
   our consciences will be: so that, if thou have any regard to the
   interest of thine own peace, if that be considerable to thee, which to
   wise men is the most valuable thing in the world, do not for a little
   wealth continue in those sins, which will create perpetual disturbance
   to thee, and embitter all the pleasures of thy life. Hear how Job
   describes the condition of the wicked oppressors in the place before
   cited: (Job xx. 12, &c.) "He shall not rejoice in them, because he hath
   oppressed; because he hath violently taken away a house which he
   builded not, surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly:" that is,
   he shall have no inward peace and contentment in the midst of all his
   outward enjoyments: but his ill-gotten estate will work in his
   conscience, and gripe him, as if a man had taken down poison into his
   belly.

   2. But chiefly, in respect of our future estate in another world, it is
   every man's interest to make restitution. Without repentance we are
   ruined for ever, and without restitution no repentance. "No unrighteous
   man hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ." If thou continue in
   thy fraud and oppression, and carry these sins with thee into another
   world, they will hang as a millstone about thy neck, and sink thee into
   eternal ruin. He that wrongeth his brother hateth him, and "he that
   hateth his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath
   eternal life abiding in him." (1 John in. 15; Rom. i. 18.) "The wrath
   of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and
   unrighteousness of men." So that if it be men's interest to escape the
   wrath of God, it concerns us to make reparation for those injuries
   which will expose us to it. That is a dreadful text, (James v. 1-4.)
   "Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come
   upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments moth-eaten: your
   gold and silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness
   against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire: ye have heaped
   treasure together for the last days. Behold! the hire of the labourers
   which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud,
   crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the
   ears of the Lord of sabaoth." Do not by "detaining the treasures of
   wickedness, treasure up to yourselves wrath against the day of wrath:"
   do not make yourselves miserable for ever, that you may be rich for a
   little while: do not for a little silver and gold forfeit the eternal
   inheritance, which was "not purchased with corruptible things, but with
   the precious blood of the Son of God:" and if this consideration, which
   is the weightiest in the world, will not prevail with men, I can only
   say with the angel, (Rev. xxii. 11.) "He that is unjust, let him be
   unjust still;" let him continue in his injustice at his peril, and
   remember what is added at the 12th verse, "Behold! I come quickly, and
   my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work shall
   be."

   II. In respect of our children and posterity, it is greatly our
   interest to make restitution. God many times suffers an estate got by
   oppression to prosper for a little while: but there is a curse attends
   it, which descends upon the estate like an incumbrance; and parents
   many times, when they think they entail an estate, entail poverty upon
   their children. Job (xx. 10.) speaking of the children of the
   oppressor, he saith, "His children shall seek to please the poor, and
   his hands shall restore their goods." And, (Job xxi. 19.) "God layeth
   up his iniquity for his children." Thou layest up riches for thy
   children; and God lays up thine iniquity and injustice for them, the
   curse that belongs to them. (Hab. ii. 9-11.) "Woe to him that covereth
   an evil covetousness, or gaineth an evil gain to his house," &c. Thou
   thoughtest to raise thy family by those ways, but "thou hast consulted
   shame to thy house." No such effectual way to ruin thy family, as
   injustice and oppression. As then you would not transmit a curse to
   your children, and devolve misery upon your family, free your estates
   from the burden and weight of what is other men's, lest, by God's just
   judgment and secret providence, that little which you injuriously
   detain from others, carry away your whole estate to them and their
   family. God's providence many times makes abundant restitution, when we
   will not.

   Having now endeavoured to satisfy men, that it is their truest interest
   to make restitution for the injuries they have done to others, it
   remains only that I should answer an objection or two, which men are
   apt to make against this duty.

   First, Men say they are ashamed to do it. Answer It is not matter of
   shame, but of praise and commendation. But it may be thou wilt say, It
   is matter of shame to have injured another; and this is the way to lay
   open thy shame. Indeed, if the injury were public, the restitution
   ought to be so too, as the only way to take off the shame of the
   injury. For thy restitution doth not in this case publish thy shame,
   but thy honesty: but if the injury was private, thou mayest preserve
   thy own credit, by concealing thyself; and provided thou do the thing
   effectually, thou mayest be as prudent, as to the manner of doing it,
   as thou pleasest.

   Secondly, Another objection is, the prejudice it will be to men's
   estates. But this I have answered already, by shewing that it is more
   their interest to make restitution, than to continue in the sin. I
   shall only add, that, as our Saviour reasons in another case, "It is
   profitable for thee, that one of thy members should perish, rather than
   that thy whole body should be cast into hell." It is true likewise
   here, it is profitable for thee, that thou shouldest go a beggar to
   heaven, rather than that thou shouldest go to hell, laden with the
   spoils and guilt of rapine and injustice.

   Thirdly, The last objection that I shall mention is, disability to make
   restitution. This, indeed, is something; where nothing is to be had,
   every man must lose his right: but then remember, that there must be a
   hearty repentance for the sin; and thy sorrow must be so much greater,
   by how much thy ability to make restitution is less; and there must be
   a willing mind, a firm purpose and resolution of doing it, when God
   shall enable thee, and diligent endeavours to that purpose. Under the
   law those who were not able to make restitution, were sold for six
   years, if their service did not make reparation in less time. It is
   true, indeed, the moderation of the gospel doth not suffer Christians
   to deal so hardly with one another: but if the gospel remit of this
   rigour, and do not allow Christians to challenge it, we should
   voluntarily do in effect that which they were forced to; that is, we
   should use our best endeavours and diligence to put ourselves into a
   condition of making satisfaction; and we should not look upon any thing
   beyond the necessary conveniences of life as our own, till we have done
   it; unless the party injured will recede from his right, in whole or in
   part. For though the impossibility of the thing do discharge us for the
   present, yet the obligation still lies upon us to do it, so soon as we
   are able.

   And here it will be proper to consider the case of those who have
   compounded with their creditors for a small part, whether they be in
   conscience and equity released from the whole debt. I am loath to lay
   unnecessary burdens upon men's consciences, therefore I am very tender
   in resolving such cases: but I ought to have a more tender care of the
   souls of men, than of their estates: therefore to deal plainly, and to
   discharge my conscience in this mat ter, I think such persons do,
   notwithstanding the composition, stand obliged in equity and conscience
   for the whole debt, and are bound to discharge it so soon as they can
   with tolerable convenience. My reason is, because, though they be
   discharged in law, yet the law does not intend to take off the
   obligation of conscience or equity, which they are under, but leaves
   that as it found it. Thus the case stands; men who are in a way of
   trade, are engaged, by the necessities of their calling, to venture a
   great part of their estate in other men's hands, and by this means
   become liable many times to be undone with out their own fault;
   therefore it is usual, when any man in a way of trade becomes disabled,
   for the creditors to make such a composition with him as his estate
   will bear; and upon this composition to give him a full discharge, so
   as that they cannot afterwards, by law, require of him the remainder of
   their debt. Now, though this be a favour to the debtor, yet it is
   principally intended for the benefit of the creditor; because it being
   his act, it is to be presumed, that he intended it, as much as may be,
   for his own advantage; and so it is, for the creditor has as much
   satisfaction at present as can be had, and the debtor is hereby left in
   a capacity of recovering himself again by his industry and diligence,
   which could not be, if he were not fully discharged; for if he were
   still liable for the rest he would continually be obnoxious to
   imprisonment, which would render him incapable of following his
   calling; or if he were at liberty, he could have no credit to enable
   him to do any thing in his calling; for who would trust a man with any
   thing, who is liable every moment to have it taken from him? so that
   the reason of this plenary discharge is this, that men, who are
   otherwise hopeful, and in a fair probability of recovering themselves,
   may not be rendered incapable of getting an estate after wards, whereby
   they may support themselves, and discharge their debts. Now this
   discharge being given in order to these ends, it cannot be imagined
   that it should be intended to defeat them; but it is in all reason to
   be supposed, that the creditors did not intend to take off the
   obligation of equity and conscience, only to put the man into a
   condition of doing something towards the enabling him to discharge his
   debt. So that unless it were expressed at the composition, that the
   creditor would never expect more from him, upon account of equity and
   conscience, but did freely forgive him the rest, the contrary whereof
   is usually done; I say, unless it were thus expressed, there is no
   reason why the creditor's favour in making a composition should be
   abused to his prejudice; and why a legal discharge given him on purpose
   for this reason among others, to put him into a capacity of recovering
   himself, and giving full satisfaction, should be so interpreted, as to
   extinguish the equitable right of the creditor to the remainder of his
   debt.

   The second use of this doctrine of restitution should be by way of
   prevention, that men would take heed of being injurious, and so take
   away the occasion of restitution, and free themselves from the
   temptation of not performing so difficult and so unwelcome a duty. It
   is much easier of the two, not to cozen or oppress thy neighbour, than,
   after thou hast done it, it will be to bring thyself to make
   restitution; therefore we should be very careful not to be injurious to
   any one in any kind; neither immediately by ourselves, nor by aiding
   and assisting others, by our power and interest, or skill in the law,
   or by any other way, to do injustice.

SERMON CLXXI.

  THE USEFULNESS OF CONSIDERATION, IN ORDER TO REPENTANCE.

   Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would
   consider their latter end!--Deut. xxxii. 29.

   THIS chapter is called Moses's Song, in which he briefly recounts the
   various providences of God to wards the people of Israel, and the
   froward carriage of that people towards him.

   First, He puts them in mind how God had chosen them for his peculiar
   people, and had by a signal care and providence conducted them all that
   tedious journey, for the space of forty years in the wilderness, until
   he had brought them to the promised land, which they had now begun to
   take possession of.

   And then he foretels, how they would behave themselves after all this
   mercy and kindness God had shewn to them: (ver. 15.) "Jeshurun waxed
   fat, and kicked, and forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed
   the rock of his salvation." Upon this, he tells them, God would be
   extremely displeased with them, and would multiply his judgments upon
   them: (ver. 19, 20.) "When the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because
   of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters: and he said, I will
   hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be; for they
   are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith." And,
   (ver. 23.) "I will heap mischief upon them, I will spend mine arrows
   upon them." And then he enumerates the particular judgments which he
   would send upon them: nay, he declares he would have utterly consumed
   them, but that he was loath to give occasion of so much triumph to his
   and their enemies: (ver. 26, 27.) "I said, I would scatter them into
   corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;
   were it not, that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
   adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should
   say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this." And he
   adds the reason of all this severity; because they were so very stupid
   and inconsiderate: (ver. 28.) "For they are a nation void of counsel,
   neither is there any understanding in them,"

   And in the conclusion of all, he represents God, as it were, breaking
   out into this vehement and affectionate wish, "Oh that they were wise,
   that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!"

   "Oh that they were wise, that they understood this!" What is that? This
   may refer to all that went before. Oh that they were wise to consider
   what God had clone for them, and what they had done against him, and
   what he will do against them, if they continue or renew their former
   provocations! Oh that they were but duly apprehensive of this, and
   would lay it seriously to heart!

   But from what follows, it seems more particularly to refer to those
   particular judgments which God had threatened them withal, and which
   would certainly befal them, if they still continued in their
   disobedience. "Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that
   they would consider their latter end!" That is, the sad consequences of
   these their provocations, that, by the consideration thereof, they
   might prevent all those evils and calamities, by turning from those
   sins which would unavoidably bring them upon them.

   From the words thus explained, I shall observe these four things:

   I. That God doth really and heartily desire the happiness of men, and
   to prevent their misery and ruin. For the very design of these words is
   to express this to us, and it is done in a very vehement, and, as I may
   say, passionate manner.

   II. That it is a great point of wisdom, to consider seriously the last
   issue and consequence of our actions, whither they tend, and what will
   follow upon them. And therefore wisdom is here described by the
   consideration of our latter end.

   III. That this is an excellent means to prevent that misery which will
   otherwise befal us. And this is necessarily implied in this wish, that
   if they would but consider these things, they might be prevented.

   IV. That the want of this consideration is the great cause of men's
   ruin. And this is likewise implied in the words, that one great reason
   of men's ruin is because they are not so wise, as to consider the fatal
   issue and consequence of a sinful course. I shall speak briefly to each
   of these.

   I. That God doth really and heartily desire the happiness of men, and
   to prevent their misery and ruin. To express this to us, God doth put
   on the vehemency of a human passion: "Oh that they were wise!" &c. The
   laws of God are a clear evidence of this; because the observance of
   them tends to our happiness. There is no good prince makes laws with
   any other design, than to promote the public welfare and happiness of
   his people: and with much more reason may we imagine, that the infinite
   good God does by all his laws design the happiness of his creatures.
   And the exhortations of Scripture, by which he enforceth his laws, are
   yet a greater evidence how earnestly he desires the happiness of his
   creatures. For it shews that he is concerned for us, when he useth so
   many arguments to persuade us to our duty, and when he expostulates so
   vehemently with us for our neglect of it, saying to sinners, "Turn ye,
   turn ye, why will you die, O house of Israel?" "Ye will not come unto
   me, that ye might have life," says our blessed Saviour, with great
   trouble to see men so obstinately set against their own happiness; and
   again, "How often would I have gathered you, as a hen gathereth her
   chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" and to satisfy us yet
   further, that it is his real desire, by our obedience to his laws, to
   prevent our ruin, God doth frequently in Scripture put on the passions
   of men, and use all sorts of vehement expressions to this purpose:
   (Deut. v. 29.) "Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they
   would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be
   well with them, and with their children for ever!" And, (Psal. lxxxi.
   13.) "Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in
   my ways! I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
   against their adversaries." (Jer. xiii. 27.) "O Israel! wilt thou not
   be made clean? when shall it once be?" And, to name but one text more,
   when our blessed .Saviour wept over Jerusalem, how passionately does he
   wish that "she had known in that her day the things that belonged to
   her peace!"

   And if, after all this, we can doubt whether the faithful God means as
   he says, he hath for our farther assurance, and to put the matter out
   of all doubt, confirmed his word by an oath: (Ezek. xxxiii. 11.) "As I
   live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
   but that the wicked turn from his ways and live. Turn ye, turn ye from
   your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?" So that if
   words can be any declaration of a hearty and sincere desire, we have no
   reason to doubt, but that God does really desire the happiness of men,
   and would gladly prevent their ruin and destruction.

   If any now ask, Why then are not all men happy? Why do they not escape
   ruin and destruction? And particularly, why the people of Israel, for
   whom God here makes this wish, did not escape those judgments which
   were threatened? the prophet shall answer for me, (Hos. xiii. 9.) "O
   Israel! thou hast destroyed thyself," And David, (Psal. lxxxi. 11.) "My
   people would not hearken to my voice, Israel would none of me." And our
   blessed Saviour, (Matt. xxiii. 37.) "How often would I have gathered
   thee, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
   not!" and, (John v. 40.) "Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have
   life." You see what account the Scripture plainly gives of this matter;
   it rests upon the wills of men, and God hath not thought fit to force
   happiness upon men, and to make them wise and good whether they will or
   no. He presents men with such motives, and offers such arguments to
   their consideration, as are fit to prevail with reasonable men, and is
   ready to afford them all necessary assistance, if they be not wanting
   to themselves; but if they will not be wise and consider, if they will
   stand out against all the arguments that God can offer, if they will
   "receive the grace of God in vain, and resist his blessed Spirit, and
   reject the counsel of God against themselves," God hath not, in this
   case, engaged himself to provide any remedy against the obstinacy and
   perverseness of men, but "their destruction is of themselves," and
   "their blood shall be upon their own heads." And there is no nicety and
   intricacy in this matter; but if men will consider Scripture and reason
   impartially, they will find this to be the plain resolution of the
   case.

   So that no man hath reason either to charge his fault or his punishment
   upon God; he is "free from the blood of all men," he sincerely desires
   our happiness; but we wilfully ruin ourselves: and when he tells us
   that he "desires not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should
   turn from his wickedness and live;" that he "would have all men to be
   saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth;" that he is "not
   willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
   repentance;" he plainly means as he says, and doth not speak to us with
   any reserve, or dark distinction between his secret and revealed will;
   he does not decree one thing and declare another.

   And if this be so, no man hath reason to be discouraged from attempting
   and endeavouring his own happiness, upon a jealousy and surmise that
   God hath, by any fatal decree, put a bar to it from all eternity; for
   if he had so absolutely resolved to make the greatest part of mankind
   miserable, with out any respect to their actions in this world, he
   would never have said, that he desires "that all should be saved;" he
   would not have exhorted all men "to work out their own salvation:" had
   he taken up any such resolution, he would have declared it to all the
   world; for he hath power enough in his hands "to do what he pleaseth,
   and none can resist his will;" so that he did not need to have
   dissembled the matter, and to have pretended a desire to save men, when
   he was resolved to ruin them.

   This is the first, that God doth really and heartily desire the
   happiness of men, and to prevent their misery and ruin. I proceed to
   the

   II. Second, That it is a great part of wisdom, to consider seriously
   the last issue and consequence of our actions, and whither the course
   of life which we lead does tend, and what will follow upon it. And
   therefore wisdom is here explained by consideration; "Oh that they were
   wise, that they would consider their latter end!" that is, what will
   befal them hereafter, what will be the issue and consequence of all the
   sins and provocations which they are guilty of.

   And this is a principal point and property of wisdom, to look forward,
   and not only to consider the present pleasure and advantage of any
   action, but the future consequence of it: and there is no greater
   argument of an imprudent man, than to gratify himself for the present
   in the doing of a thing which will turn to his greater prejudice
   afterwards; especially if the future inconvenience be great and
   intolerable, as it is in the case we are speaking of. For eternal
   happiness or misery depends upon the actions of this present life; and
   according as we behave ourselves in this world, it will go well or ill
   with us for ever: so that this is a matter of vast importance, and
   deserves our most serious thoughts; and, in matters of mighty
   consequence, a wise man will take ail things into consideration, and
   look before him as far as he can. And indeed this is the reason why
   things of great moment are said to be things of consequence, because
   great things depend and are likely to follow upon them: and then surely
   that is the greatest concernment, upon which, not only the happiness of
   this present life, but our happiness to all eternity, does depend; and
   if the good and bad actions of this life be of that consequence to us,
   it is fit every man should consider what he does, and whither the
   course of life he is engaged, or about to engage in, will lead him at
   last. For this is true wisdom, to look to the end of things, and to
   think "seriously beforehand what is likely to be the event of such an
   action, of such a course of life. If we serve God faithfully, and do
   his will, what will be the consequence of that to us in this world and
   the other: and, on the other hand, if we live wickedly, and allow
   ourselves in any unlawful and vicious practice, what will be the end of
   that course.

   And to any man that consults the law of his own nature, or the will of
   God revealed in Scripture, nothing can be plainer than what will be the
   end of these several ways. God hath plainly told us, and our own
   consciences will tell us the same, that if we do well we shall be
   accepted of God, and rewarded by him; but if we do ill, "the end of
   these things is death, that indignation and wrath, tribulation and
   anguish, will be upon every soul of man that doeth evil; but honour,
   and glory, and peace to every man that doeth good, in the day when God
   shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to the
   gospel."

   So that God hath given us a plain prospect of the different issues of a
   virtuous and wicked life, and there wants nothing but consideration to
   make us to attend to these things, and to lay them seriously to heart.
   For while men are inconsiderate, they go on stupidly in an evil way,
   and are not sensible of the danger of their present course, because
   they do not attend to the consequence of it: but when their eyes are
   once opened by consideration, they cannot but be sadly apprehensive of
   the mischief they are running themselves upon. If men would take but a
   serious and impartial view of their lives and actions; if they would
   consider the tendency of a sinful course, and whither it will bring
   them at last; if the vicious and dissolute wan would but look about him
   and consider how many have been ruined in that very way that he is in,
   how many lie slain and wounded in it; that "it is the way to hell, and
   leads down to the chambers of death;" the serious thought of this could
   not but check him in his course, and make him resolve upon a better
   life. If men were wise, they would consider the consequence of their
   actions, and upon consideration would resolve upon that which they are
   convinced is best. I proceed to the

   III. Third thing I propounded, which was, that consideration of the
   consequence of our actions, is an excellent means to prevent the
   mischiefs which otherwise we should run into. And this is necessarily
   implied in the wish here in the text, that if we would but consider
   these things, they might be prevented. For how can any man, who hath
   any love or regard for himself, any tenderness for his own interest and
   happiness, see hell and destruction before him, which, if he hold on
   his evil course, will certainly swallow him up, and yet venture to go
   on in his sins? Can any man that plainly beholds misery hastening
   towards him like an armed man, and "destruction coming upon him as a
   whirlwind," think himself unconcerned to prevent it and fly from it?
   The most dull and stupid creatures will start back upon the sight of
   present danger. Balaam's ass, when she saw the angel of the Lord
   standing in the way, with his sword drawn ready to smite her, starts
   aside, and could not be urged on. Now God hath given us, not only sense
   to apprehend a present evil, but reason and consideration to look
   before us, and to discover dangers at a distance, to apprehend them as
   certainly and with as clear a conviction of the reality of them, as if
   they threatened us the next moment: and will any considerate man, who
   hath calculated the dangerous events of sin, and the dreadful effects
   of God's wrath upon sinners, go on to "provoke the Lord to jealousy, as
   if he were stronger than he?" It is not to be imagined, but that, if
   men would seriously consider what sin is, and what shall be the sad
   portion of sinners hereafter, they would resolve upon a better course.
   Would any man live in the lusts of the flesh, and of intemperance, or
   out of covetousness defraud or oppress his neighbour, did he seriously
   consider that God is the avenger of such, and that, "because of these
   things, the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience?"

   I should have great hopes of men's repentance and reformation, if they
   could but once be brought to consideration; for in most men it is not
   so much a positive disbelief of the truth, as inadvertency and want of
   consideration, that makes them to go on so securely in a sinful course.
   Would but men consider what sin is, and what will be the fearful
   consequence of it, probably in this world, but most certainly in the
   other, they could not choose but fly from it as the greatest evil in
   the world.

   And to shew what power and influence consideration will probably have
   to bring men to repentance, and a change of their lives, I remember to
   have somewhere met with a very remarkable story, of one that had a son
   that took bad courses, and would not be reclaimed by all the good
   counsel his father could give him; at last, coming to his father, who
   lay upon his death-bed, to beg his blessing, his father, instead of
   upbraiding him with his bad life, and undutiful carriage toward him,
   spake kindly to him, and told him, he had but one thing to desire of
   him, that every day he would retire and spend one quarter of an hour
   alone by himself; which he promised his father faithfully to do, and
   make it good. After a while it grew tedious to him, to spend even so
   little time in such bad and uneasy company, and he began to bethink
   himself, for what reason his father should so earnestly desire of him
   to do so odd a thing for his sake, and his mind presently suggested to
   him, that it was to enforce him to consideration; wisely judging, that
   if by any means he could but bring him to that, he would soon reform
   his life, and become a new man. And the thing had its desired effect;
   for after a little consideration, he took up a firm resolution to
   change the course of his life, and was true to it all his days. I
   cannot answer for the truth of the story, but for the moral of it I
   will; namely, that consideration is one of the best and most likely
   things in the world, to bring a bad man to a better mind. I now come to
   the

   IV. Fourth, and last particular, namely, that the want of this
   consideration is one of the greatest causes of men's ruin. And this
   likewise is implied in the text; and the reason why God does so
   vehemently desire that men would be wise and consider, is, because so
   many are ruined and undone for want of it. This is the desperate folly
   of man kind, that they seldom think seriously of the consequence of
   their actions, and least of all such as are of greatest concernment to
   them, and have the chief influence upon their eternal condition. They
   do not consider what mischief and inconveniency a wicked life may
   plunge them into in this world, what trouble and disturbance it may
   give them when they come to die; what horror and confusion it may fill
   them withal, when they are leaving this world, and passing into
   eternity; and what intolerable misery and torment it may bring upon
   them to all eternity. Did men ponder and lay to heart death and
   judgment, heaven and hell; and would they but let their thoughts dwell
   upon these things, it is not credible that the generality of men could
   lead such profane and impious, such lewd and dissolute, such secure and
   careless, lives as they do.

   Would but a man frequently entertain his mind with such thoughts as
   these--I must shortly die, and leave this world, and then all the
   pleasures and enjoyments of it will be to me as if they had never been,
   only that the remembrance of them, and the ill use I have made of them,
   will be very bitter and grievous to me; after all, death will transmit
   me out of this world, into a quite different state and scene of things,
   into the presence of that great and terrible, that inflexible and
   impartial Judge, who will "render to every man according to his works;"
   and then all the evils which I have done in this life will rise up in
   judgment against me, and fill me with ever lasting confusion, in that
   great assembly of men and angels; will banish me from the presence of
   God, and all the happiness which flows from it, and procure a dreadful
   sentence of unspeakable misery and torment to be passed upon me, which
   I can never get reversed, nor yet never be able to stand under the
   weight of it. If men would but enter into the serious consideration of
   these things, and pursue these thoughts to some issue and conclusion,
   they would take up other resolutions; and I verily believe, that the
   want of this hath ruined more than even infidelity itself. And this I
   take to be the meaning of that question in the Psalmist, "Have all the
   workers of iniquity no knowledge?" that is, no consideration?
   intimating, that if they had, they would do better.

   All that now remains is, to persuade men to apply their hearts to this
   piece of wisdom, to look before them, and to think seriously of the
   consequence of their actions, what will be the final issue of that
   course of life they are engaged in; and if they continue in it, what
   will become of them hereafter, what will become of them for ever.

   And here I might apply this text, as God here does to the people of
   Israel, to the public condition of the nation, which is not so very
   unlike to that of the people of Israel; for God seems to have chosen
   this nation for his more peculiar people, and hath exercised a very
   particular providence towards us, in conducting us through that
   wilderness of confusion, in which we have been wandering for the space
   of above forty years; and when things were come unto the last
   extremity, and we seemed to stand upon the very brink of ruin, then (as
   it is said of the people of Israel, ver. 36, of this chapter), "God
   repented himself for his servants, when he saw their power was gone:"
   that is, that they were utterly unable to help themselves, and to work
   their own deliverance. And it may be said of us, as Moses does of that
   people, (chap. xxxiii. 29.) "Happy art thou, O Israel, O people saved
   by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy
   excellency!" Never did any nation struggle with, and get through, so
   many, and so great difficulties, as we have several times done.

   And I fear we have behaved ourselves towards God not much better than
   the people of Israel did; but, like Jeshurun, after many deliverances
   and great mercies, "have waxed fat and kicked, have forsaken the God
   that made us, and little esteemed the Rock of our salvation;" by which
   we have "provoked the Lord to jealousy," and have, as it were, forced
   him to multiply his judgments, and to spend his arrows upon us, "and to
   hide his face from us, to see what our end will be:" so that we have
   reason to fear, that God would have brought utter ruin and destruction
   upon us, and "scattered us into corners, and made the remembrance of us
   to have ceased from among men, had he not feared the wrath of the
   enemy, and lest the adversaries should have behaved themselves
   strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the Lord
   hath not done all this ," that is, lest they should ascribe this just
   vengeance of God upon a sinful and unthankful nation, to the goodness
   and righteousness of their own cause, and to the favour and assistance
   of the idols and false gods whom they worshipped, to the patronage and
   aid of the Virgin Mary, and the saints; to whom, contrary to the will
   and command of the true God, they had offered up so many prayers and
   vows, and paid the greatest part of their religious worship. But "the
   Lord hath shewn himself greater than all gods, and in the things
   wherein they dealt proudly, that he is above them: for our Rock is not
   as their rock, even our enemies themselves being judges."

   And we have been too like the people of Israel in other respects also;
   so fickle and inconstant, that after great deliverances we are
   presently apt to murmur and be discontented, to grow sick of our own
   happiness, and "to turn back in our hearts into Egypt;" so that God may
   complain of us, as he does of his people Israel, that nothing that he
   could do, would bring them to consideration, and make them better,
   neither his mercies nor his judgments: (Isa. i. 2, 3.) "Hear, O heaven!
   and give ear, O earth! for the Lord hath spoken: I have nourished and
   brought up children, but they have rebelled against me. The ox knoweth
   his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know; my
   people doth not consider." And so likewise he complains that his
   judgments had no effect upon them; (ver. 5.) "Why should ye be smitten
   any more? Ye will revolt more and more." Well, therefore, may it be
   said of us, as it was of them in the verse before the text, "They are a
   nation void of knowledge, neither is there any understanding in them."
   And the wish that follows in the text, is as seasonable for us as it
   was for them, "Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that
   they would consider their latter end!"

   And by parity of reason, this may likewise be applied to particular
   persons, and to persuade every one of us to a serious consideration of
   the final issue and consequence of our actions. I will only offer these
   two arguments:

   1. That consideration is the proper act of reasonable creatures, and
   that whereby we shew ourselves men. So the prophet intimates, (Isa.
   xlvi. 8.) "Remember this, and shew yourselves men; bring it again to
   mind, O ye transgressors!" That is, consider it well, think of it again
   and again, ye that run on so furiously in a sinful course, what the end
   and issue of these things will be. If ye do not do this, you do not
   shew yourselves men, you do not act like reasonable creatures, to whom
   it is peculiar to propose to themselves some end and design of their
   actions; but rather like brute creatures, which have no understanding,
   and act only by a natural instinct, without any consideration of the
   end of their actions, or of the means conducing to it.

   2. Whether we consider it or not, our latter end will come; and all
   those dismal consequences of a sinful course, which God hath so plainly
   threatened, and our own consciences do so much dread, will certainly
   overtake us at last; and we cannot, by not thinking of these things,
   ever prevent or avoid them. Death will come, and after that the
   judgment, and an irreversible doom will pass upon us according to all
   the evil that we have done, and all the good that we have neglected to
   do in this life, under the heavy weight and pressure whereof we must
   lie groaning, and bewailing ourselves to everlasting ages.

   God now exerciseth his mercy, and patience, and long-suffering towards
   us, in expectation of our amendment; he reprieves us on purpose that we
   may repent, and in hopes that we will at last consider and grow wiser;
   for "he is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come
   to repentance:" but if we will trifle away this day of God's grace and
   patience, if we will not consider and bethink ourselves, there is
   another day that will certainly come, "That great and terrible day of
   the Lord, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
   the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the
   works that are there in, shall be burnt up."

   "Seeing then all these things shall be," let us consider seriously
   "what manner of persons we ought to be, in all holy conversation and
   godliness, waiting for, and hastening unto, the coming of the day of
   God;" to whom be glory now and for ever.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CLXXII.

  THE DANGER OF IMPENITENCE WHERE THE GOSPEL IS PREACHED.

   Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
   works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they
   would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto
   you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of
   judgment than for you.--Matt. xi. 21, 22.

   AFTER our blessed Saviour had instructed, and sent forth his disciples,
   he himself went abroad to preach unto the cities of Israel;
   particularly he spent much time in the cities of Galilee, Chorazin, and
   Bethsaida, and Capernaum, preaching the gospel to them, and working
   many and great miracles among them; but with little or no success:
   which was the cause of his denouncing this terrible woe against them;
   (ver. 20.) "Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his
   mighty works were done, because they repented not. Woe unto thee,
   Chorazin!" &c.

   In which words our Saviour declares the sad and miserable condition of
   those two cities, Chorazin and Bethsaida, which had neglected such an
   opportunity, and resisted and withstood such means of repentance, as
   would have effectually reclaimed the most wicked cities and people that
   can be instanced in any age, Tyre, and Sidon, and Sodom; and therefore
   he tells them, that their condition was much worse, and that they
   should fall under a heavier sentence at the day of judgment, than the
   people of those cities whom they had always looked upon as the greatest
   sinners that ever were in the world. This is the plain meaning of the
   words in general; but yet there are some difficulties in them, which I
   shall endeavour to clear, and then proceed to raise such observations
   from them, as may be instructive and useful to us.

   The difficulties are these:

   I. What repentance is here spoken of; whether an external repentance,
   in show and appearance only, or an inward, and real, and sincere
   repentance.

   II. In what sense it is said, that "Tyre and Sidon would have
   repented."

   III. What is meant by their "would have repented long ago."

   IV. How this assertion of our Saviour's, that miracles would have
   converted Tyre and Sidon, is reconcileable with that other saying of
   his, (Luke xvi. 31.) in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, that
   "those who believed not Moses and the prophets, neither would they be
   persuaded though one rose from the dead."

   I. What repentance is here spoken of; whether a mere external and
   hypocritical repentance in show and appearance only, or an inward, and
   real, and sincere repentance.

   The reason of this doubt depends upon the different theories of
   divines, about the sufficiency of grace accompanying the outward means
   of repentance, and whether an irresistible degree of God's grace be
   necessary to repentance; for they who deny sufficient grace to
   accompany the outward means of repentance, and assert an irresistible
   degree of God's grace necessary to repentance, are forced to say that
   our Saviour here speaks of a mere external repentance; because if he
   spake of an inward and sincere repentance, then it must be granted,
   that sufficient inward grace did accompany the miracles that were
   wrought in Chorazin and Bethsaida, to bring men to repentance; because
   what was afforded to them, would have brought Tyre and Sid on to
   repentance. And that which would have effected a thing, cannot be
   denied to be sufficient: so that unless our Saviour here speaks of a
   mere external repentance, either the outward means of repentance, as
   preaching and miracles, must be granted to be sufficient to bring men
   to repentance, without the inward operation of God's grace upon the
   minds of men; or else a sufficient degree of God's grace must be
   acknowledged to accompany the outward means of repentance. Again, if an
   irresistible degree of grace be necessary to true repentance, it is
   plain, Chorazin and Bethsaida had it not, because they did not repent;
   and yet, with out this, Tyre and Sidon could not sincerely have
   repented: therefore our Saviour here must speak of a mere external
   repentance. Thus some argue, as they do likewise concerning the
   repentance of Nineveh, making that also to be merely external, because
   they are loath to allow true repentance to heathens.

   But it seems very plain, that our Saviour does speak of an inward, and
   true, and sincere repentance; and therefore, the doctrines that will
   not admit this, are not true. For our Saviour speaks of the same kind
   of repentance, that he upbraideth them with the want of, in the verse
   before the text. "Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of
   his mighty works were done, because they repented not;" that is,
   because they were not brought to a sincere repentance, by his
   preaching, which was confirmed by such great miracles. It is true,
   indeed, he mentions the outward signs and expressions of repentance,
   when he says, u they would have repented in sackcloth and ashes;" but
   not as excluding inward and real repentance, but supposing it, as is
   evident from what is said in the next verse, "It shall be more
   tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, at the day of judgment, than for you:"
   for though an external and hypocritical repentance may prevail with God
   to put off temporal judgments, yet surely it will be but a very small,
   if any, mitigation of our condemnation at the day of judgment: so that
   the repentance here spoken of cannot, without great violence to the
   scope and design of our Saviour's argument, be understood only of an
   external shew and appearance of repentance.

   II. The next difficulty to be cleared is, in what sense it is here
   said, that "if the mighty works which were done" by our Saviour among
   the Jews, "had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented."

   Some, to avoid the inconvenience which they apprehend to be in the more
   strict and literal sense of the words, look upon them as hyperbolical:
   as we say, such a thing would move a stone, or the like, when we would
   express something to be very sad and grievous; so here, to aggravate
   the impenitence of the Jews, our Saviour says, that they resisted those
   means of repentance, which one would think should almost have prevailed
   upon the great est and most obdurate sinners that ever were; but not
   intending to affirm any such thing.

   But there is no colour for this, if we consider that our Saviour
   reasons from the supposition of such a thing, that therefore the case
   of Tyre and Sidon would really be "more tolerable at the day of
   judgment" than theirs; because they would have repented, but the Jews
   did not.

   Others, perhaps, understand the words too strictly, as if our Saviour
   had spoken according to what he certainly foreknew would have happened
   to the people of Tyre and Sidon, if such miracles had been wrought
   among them. And no doubt but, in that case, God did certainly know what
   they would have done; but yet I should rather choose to understand the
   words as spoken popularly, according to what in all human appearance
   and probability would have happened, if such external means of
   repentance, accompanied with an ordinary grace of God, had been
   afforded to them of Tyre and Sidon. And thus the old Latin interpreter
   seems to have understood the next words: "If the mighty works which
   have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, e'meinan a'n, forte
   mansissent, "it would perhaps have remained to this day--in all
   likelihood it had continued till now." Much the same with that passage
   of the prophet: (Ezek. iii. 5, 6.) "Thou art not sent to a people of a
   strange speech, and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel:
   surely had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee;"
   that is, in all probability they would; there is little doubt to be
   made of the contrary. And this is sufficient foundation for our
   Saviour's reasoning after wards, that "it shall be more tolerable for
   Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for them." And if we may
   judge what they would have done before, by what they did afterward,
   there is more than probability for it: for we read in the 21st chapter
   of the Acts, (ver. 3. 7.) that the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon
   received the gospel, and kindly entertained St. Paul, when the Jews
   rejected them both. The

   III, Third thing to be cleared is, what is meant by long ago; "they
   would have repented long ago."

   Some understand this, as if our Saviour had said, they would not have
   stood out so long against so much preaching, and so many miracles; but
   would at first have repented, long before our Saviour gave over
   Chorazin and Bethsaida for obstinate and in corrigible sinners; they
   would not only have repented at last, but much sooner, and without so
   much ado.

   But this does not seem to be the meaning of the words; but our Saviour
   seems to refer to those ancient times, long ago, when the prophets
   denounced judgments against Tyre and Sidon, particularly the prophet
   Ezekiel; and to say, that if in those days the preaching of that
   prophet had been accompanied with such miracles as our Saviour wrought
   in the cities of Galilee, Tyre and Sidon would in those days have
   repented.

   The last and greatest difficulty of all is, how this assertion of our
   Saviour, that miracles would have converted Tyre and Sidon, is
   reconcileable with that discourse of our Saviour's (Luke xvi.) in the
   parable of the rich man and Lazarus, that those who would not believe
   Moses and the prophets, would not have been persuaded, though one had
   rose from the dead.

   The true answer to which difficulty, in short, is this: that when our
   Saviour says, "if they believe not Moses and the prophets, neither will
   they be persuaded though one rose from the dead:" he does not hereby
   weaken the force of miracles, or their aptness to convince men, and
   bring them to repentance; but rather confirm it: because Moses and the
   prophets had the attestation of many and great miracles; and therefore
   there was no reason to think, that they who would not believe the
   writings and doctrine of Moses and the prophets, which had the
   confirmation of so many miracles, and was owned by themselves to have
   so, should be wrought upon by one particular miracle--the coming of one
   from the dead, and speaking unto them: or, however this might move and
   astonish them, for the present, yet it was not likely that the grace of
   God should concur with such an extraordinary means, to render it
   effectual to their conversion and repentance, who had wilfully
   despised, and obstinately rejected, that which had a much greater
   confirmation than the discourse of a man risen from the dead, and was
   appointed by God for the ordinary and standing means of bringing men to
   repentance. So that our Saviour might, with reason enough, pronounce
   that Tyre and Sidon, who never had a standing revelation of God to
   bring them to repentance, nor had rejected it, would, upon miracles
   extraordinarily wrought among them, have repented; and yet deny it
   elsewhere to be likely, that they who rejected a standing revelation of
   God, confirmed by miracles, which called them to repentance, would
   probably be brought to repentance by a particular miracle; or that God
   should afford his grace to make it effectual for their repentance and
   salvation.

   The words being thus cleared, I come now to raise such observations
   from them, as may be instructive and useful to us.

   I. I observe from this discourse of our Saviour, that miracles are of
   great force and efficacy to bring men to repentance.

   This our Saviour's discourse here supposeth; otherwise their
   impenitence had not been so criminal and inexcusable upon that account,
   that such mighty works had been done among them, as would probably have
   prevailed upon some of the worst people that had been in the world; for
   such were the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, guilty of great
   covetousness and fraud, pride and luxury, the usual sins of places of
   great traffic and commerce: and such, to be sure, was Sodom; and yet
   our Saviour tells us, that the miracles which he had wrought in the
   cities of Israel, would, in all probability, have brought those great
   sinners to repentance; namely, by bringing them to faith, and
   convincing them of the truth and divinity of that doctrine which he
   preached unto them, and which contains such powerful arguments to
   repentance and amendment of life.

   II. I observe, likewise, from our Saviour's discourse, that God is not
   always obliged to work miracles for the conversion of sinners. It is
   great goodness in him to afford sufficient means of repentance to men,
   as he did to Tyre and Sidon, in calling them to repentance by his
   prophet; though such miracles were not wrought among them, as God
   thought fit to accompany our Saviour's preaching withal.

   This I observe, to prevent a kind of bold and saucy objection, which
   some would perhaps be apt to make: If Tyre and Sidon would have
   repented, had such miracles been wrought among them, as our Saviour
   wrought in Chorazin and Bethsaida, why were they not wrought, that they
   might have repented? To which it is sufficient answer to say, that God
   is not obliged to do all that is possible to be &lt;3one, to reclaim
   men from their sins; he is not obliged to overpower their wills, and to
   work irresistibly upon their minds, which he can easily do; he is not
   obliged to work miracles for every particular man's conviction; nor
   where he vouchsafeth to do this, is he obliged always to work the
   greatest and most convincing miracles; his goodness will not suffer him
   to omit what is necessary and sufficient to bring men to repentance and
   happiness; nay, beyond this he many times does more; but it is
   sufficient to vindicate the justice and goodness of God, that he is not
   wanting to us, in affording the means necessary to reclaim us from our
   sins, and to bring us to goodness. That which is properly our part, is
   to make use of those means which God affords us to become better, and
   not to prescribe to him how much he should do for us; to be thankful
   that he hath done so much, and not to find fault with him for having
   done no more.

   III. I observe farther, from our Saviour's discourse, that the external
   means of repentance which God affords to men, do suppose an inward
   grace of God accompanying them, sufficiently enabling men to repent, if
   it be not their own fault; I say, a sufficient grace of God
   accompanying the outward means of repentance, till, by our wilful and
   obstinate neglect and resistance, and opposition of this grace, we
   provoke God to withdraw it from the means, or else to withdraw both the
   grace and the means from us: otherwise impenitence, after such external
   means afforded, would be no new and special fault. For if the
   concurrence of God's grace with the outward means be necessary to work
   repentance, then the impenitence of those, to whom this grace is not
   afforded, which yet is necessary to repentance, is neither any new sin,
   nor any new aggravation of their former impenitence. For no man can
   imagine that the just God will charge men with new guilt, and increase
   their condemnation, for remaining impenitent in such circumstances in
   which it is impossible for them to repent.

   IV. I observe from this discourse of our Saviour's, that an
   irresistible degree of grace is not necessary to repentance, nor
   commonly afforded to those who do repent. God may, where he pleaseth,
   without injury to any man, overpower his will, and stop him in his
   course, and hinder him from making himself miserable, and by an
   irresistible light convince him of his error and the evil of his ways,
   and bring him to a better mind: but this God seldom does, and, when he
   does it, it is very probable it is not so much for their own sakes, as
   to make them instruments of good to others. Thus by a secret but
   overpowering influence he overruled the disciples to follow our
   Saviour, and to leave their callings and relations, and all their
   temporal concernments to do it. But one of the most remarkable examples
   of this extraordinary grace of God is St. Paul, who was violently
   stopped in his course of persecuting the Christians, and convinced of
   his sin, and brought over to Christianity, in a very extraordinary and
   forcible manner. And of this miraculous and extraordinary conversion,
   God himself gives this account; that he was" a chosen vessel unto him,
   to bear his name before the gentiles and kings, and the children of
   Israel;" (Acts ix. 15.) And St. Paul tells us, (Gal. i. 15, 16.) that
   for this end God had separated him from his mother's womb, and called
   him by his grace, and revealed his Son to him, in that extraordinary
   manner, that he might preach among the heathen.

   But generally God does not bring men thus to repentance; nor is it
   necessary he should. For if an irresistible degree of grace were always
   necessary to bring men to repentance, there could be no difference
   between the impenitence of Chorazin and Bethsaida, and of Tyre and
   Sidon. For, according to this doctrine of the necessity of irresistible
   grace to the conversion of every man, it is evident, that Tyre and
   Sidon neither could nor would have repented, without an irresistible
   degree of God's grace accompanying the outward means of repentance
   which he afforded to them; because such a degree of grace is necessary
   to repentance, and, without it, it is impossible for any man to repent.
   But then it is as plain, on the contrary, that if Chorazin and
   Bethsaida had had the same irresistible degree of God's grace, together
   with the outward means of repentance, afforded to them, that they would
   have repented as certainly as Tyre and Sidon. Where then is the reason
   of upbraiding the impenitence of the one more than of the other? Where
   the aggravation of the one's guilt above the other? Where the justice
   of punishing the impenitence of Chorazin and Bethsaida more than theirs
   of Tyre and Sidon? For, upon this supposition, they must either have
   repented both alike, or have been both equally impenitent. The sum of
   what I have said is this: that if no man does, nor can repent, without
   such a degree of God's grace as cannot be resisted, no man's repentance
   is commendable, nor is one man's impenitence more blameable than
   .another's; Chorazin and Bethsaida can be in no more fault for
   continuing impenitent, than Tyre and Sidon were. For either this
   irresistible grace is afforded to men or not: if it be, their
   repentance is necessary, and they cannot help it; if it be not, their
   repentance is impossible, and consequently, their impenitence is
   necessary, and they cannot help it neither.

   V. I observe from the main scope of our Saviour's discourse, that the
   sins and impenitence of men receive their aggravation, and consequently
   shall have their punishment proportionable, to the opportunities and
   means of repentance which those persons have enjoyed and neglected.

   For what is here said of miracles, is by equality of reason likewise
   true of all other advantages and means of repentance and salvation. The
   reason why miracles will be such an aggravation of the condemnation of
   men is, because they are so proper and powerful a means to convince
   them of the truth and divinity of that doctrine which calls them to
   repentance. So that all those means which God affords to us of the
   knowledge of our duty, of conviction of the evil and danger of a sinful
   course, are so many helps and motives to repentance, and consequently
   will prove so many aggravations of our sin and punishment, if we
   continue impenitent. The

   VI. Sixth and last observation, and which naturally follows from the
   former, is this: that the case of those, who are impenitent under the
   gospel, is of all others the most dangerous, and their damnation shall
   be heaviest and most severe.

   And this brings the case of these cities here in the text home to
   ourselves. For in truth there is no material difference between the
   case of Chorazin and Bethsaida and Capernaum, and of ourselves in this
   city and nation, who enjoy the clear light of the gospel, with all the
   freedom and all the advantages that any people ever did. The mercies of
   God to this nation have been very great, especially in bringing us out
   of that darkness and superstition, which covered this western part of
   the world; in rescuing us from that great corruption and degeneracy of
   the Christian religion, which prevailed among us, by so early and so
   regular a reformation; and in continuing so long this great blessing to
   us. The judgments of God have been likewise very great upon us for our
   sins. "God hath manifested himself by terrible things in
   righteousness;" our eyes have seen many and dismal calamities in the
   space of a few years, which call loudly upon us to repent and turn to
   God. God hath afforded us the most effectual means of repentance, and
   hath taken the most effectual course of bringing us to it. And though
   our blessed Saviour does not speak to us in person, nor do we at this
   day see miracles wrought among us, as the Jews did; yet we have the
   doctrine which our blessed Saviour preached faithfully transmitted to
   us, and a credible relation of the miracles wrought for the
   confirmation of that doctrine, and many other arguments to persuade us
   of the truth of it, which those to whom our Saviour spake had not, nor
   could not then have, taken from the accomplishing of our Saviour's
   predictions, after his death; the speedy propagation and wonderful
   success of this doctrine in the world, by weak and inconsiderable
   means, against all the power and opposition of the world; the
   destruction of Jerusalem, and the dispersion of the Jewish nation,
   according to our Saviour's prophecy; besides many more that might be
   mentioned. And, which is a mighty advantage to us, we are free from
   those prejudices against the person of our Saviour and his doctrine,
   which the Jews, by the reverence which they bear to their rulers and
   teachers, were generally possessed withal; we are brought up in the
   belief of it, and have drunk it in by education; and, if we believe it,
   as we all profess to do, we have all the obligation and all the
   arguments to repentance, which the Jews could possibly have from the
   miracles which they saw: for they were means of repentance to them no
   otherwise than as they brought them to the belief of our Saviour's
   doctrine, which called them to repentance.

   So that if we continue impenitent, the same woe is denounced against us
   that is against Chorazin and Bethsaida; and we may be said, with
   Capernaum, to be lifted up to heaven, by the enjoyment of the most
   excellent means and advantages of salvation, that any people ever had;
   which, if we neglect, and still continue wicked and impenitent under
   them, we may justly fear, that with them we shall be thrown down to
   hell, and have our place in the lowest part of that dismal dungeon, and
   in the very centre of that fiery furnace.

   Never was there greater cause to upbraid the impenitence of any people,
   than of us, considering the means and opportunities which we enjoy; and
   never had any greater reason to fear a severer doom, than we have.
   Impenitence in a heathen is a great sin; else how should God judge the
   world? But God takes no notice of that, in comparison of the
   impenitence of Christians, who enjoy the gospel, and are convinced of
   the truth, and upon the greatest reason in the world profess to believe
   it. We Christians have all the obligations to repentance, that reason
   and revelation, nature and grace, can lay upon us. Art thou convinced
   that thou hast sinned, and done that which is contrary to thy duty, and
   thereby provoked the wrath of God, and incensed his justice against
   thee? As thou art a man, and upon the stock of natural principles, thou
   art obliged to repentance. The same light of reason which disco vers to
   thee the errors of thy life, and challengeth thee for thy impiety and
   intemperance, for thy in justice and oppression, for thy pride and
   passion; the same natural conscience which accuseth thee of any
   miscarriages, does oblige thee to be sorry for them, "to turn from thy
   evil ways, and to break off thy sins by repentance." For nothing can be
   more unreasonable, than for a man to know a fault, and yet not think
   himself bound to be sorry for it; to be convinced of the evil of his
   ways, and not to think himself obliged by that very conviction, to turn
   from it, and forsake it. If there be any such thing as a natural law
   written in men's hearts, which the apostle tells us the heathens had,
   it is impossible to imagine, but that the law which obliges men not to
   transgress, should oblige them to repentance in case of transgression.
   And this every man in the world is bound to, though he had never seen
   the Bible, nor heard of the name of Christ. And the revelation of the
   gospel doth not supersede this obligation, but adds new strength and
   force to it: and by how much this duty of repentance is more clearly
   revealed by our blessed Saviour in the gospel; by how much the
   arguments which the gospel useth to persuade men, and encourage them to
   repentance, are greater and more powerful by so much is the impenitence
   of those who live under the gospel the more inexcusable.

   Had we only some faint hopes of God's mercy, a doubtful opinion and
   weak persuasion of the rewards and punishments of another world; yet we
   have a law within us, which, upon the probability of these
   considerations, would oblige us to repentance. Indeed, if men were
   assured upon good grounds, that there would be no future rewards and
   punishments; then the sanction of the law were gone, and it would lose
   its force and obligation: or if we did despair of the mercy of God, and
   had good reason to think repentance impossible, or that it would do us
   no good; in that case there would be no sufficient motive and argument
   to repentance: for no man can return to his duty, without returning to
   the love of God and goodness; and no man can return to the love of God,
   who believes that he bears an implacable hatred against him, and is
   resolved to make him miserable for ever. During this persuasion, no man
   can repent. And this seems to be the reason, why the devils continue
   impenitent.

   But the heathens were not without hopes of God's mercy, and upon those
   small hopes which they had, they encouraged themselves into repentance;
   as you may see in the instance of the Ninevites. "Let them turn every
   one from his evil ways, and from the violence that is in their hands.
   Who can tell, if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his
   fierce anger, that we perish not?" (Jonah iii. 8, 9.) But if we, who
   have the clearest discoveries, and the highest assurance of this, who
   profess to believe that God hath declared himself placable to all
   mankind, that "he is in Christ reconciling the world to himself," and
   that upon our repentance "he will not impute our sins to us;" if we, to
   whom "the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness
   and unrighteousness of men," and to whom "life and immortality are
   brought to light by the gospel;" if, after all this, we still go on in
   an impenitent course, what shall we be able to plead in excuse of
   ourselves at that great day? "The men of Nineveh shall rise up in
   judgment" against such an impenitent generation, "and condemn it;
   because they repented" upon the terror of lighter threatenings, and
   upon the encouragement of weaker hopes.

   And therefore it concerns us, who call ourselves Christians, and enjoy
   the clear revelation of the gospel, to look about us, and take heed how
   we continue in an evil course. For if we remain impenitent, after all
   the arguments which the gospel, superadded to the light of nature,
   affords to us to bring us to repentance, it shall not only "be more
   tolerable for the men of Nineveh," but "for Tyre and Sidon, for Sodom
   and Gomorrah," the most wicked and impenitent heathens, "at the day of
   judgment, than for us." For, because we have stronger arguments, and
   more powerful encouragements to repentance, than they had, if we do not
   repent, we shall meet a heavier doom, and a fiercer damnation. The
   heathen world had many excuses to plead for themselves, which we have
   not. "The times of that ignorance God winked at: but now commands all
   men every where to repent; because he hath appointed a day, in the
   which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that Man whom he
   hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he
   hath raised him from the dead."

SERMON CLXXIII.

  OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, AS DISCOVERED BY NATURE, AND BY REVELATION.

   But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
   who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to
   light through the gospel.--2 Tim. i. 10.

   THE design of the apostle in these two Epistles to Timothy, is to
   direct him how he ought to demean himself, in the office which he bore
   in the church, which he does in the First Epistle: and to encourage him
   in his work; which he does here in the Second; in which, after his
   usual salutation, he endeavours to arm him against the fear of those
   persecutions, and the shame of those reproaches, which would probably
   attend him in the work of the gospel: (ver. 8.) "Be not thou therefore
   ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but be
   thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power
   of God, who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling:" as if he
   had said, The God whom thou serves in this employment, and by whose
   power thou art strengthened, is he that "hath saved and called us with
   a holy calling;" that is, it is he who, by Jesus Christ, hath brought
   salvation to us, and called us to this holy profession; "not according
   to our works," that is, not that -we, by any thing that we have done,
   have deserved this at his hand, "but according to his own purpose and
   grace," that is, according to his own gracious purpose, "which was
   given in Christ before the world began;" that is, which from all
   eternity he decreed and determined to accomplish by Jesus Christ: "but
   is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ;"
   that is, which gracious purpose of his is now clearly discovered, by
   our Saviour Jesus Christ's coming into the world, "who hath abolished
   death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the
   gospel."

   Which words express to us two happy effects of Christ's appearance:
   first, the abolishing of death; and, secondly, the bringing of "life
   and immortality to light." In the handling of these words, I shall,

   First, Open to you the meaning of the several expressions in the text.

   Secondly, Shew what our Saviour Jesus Christ did towards the abolishing
   of death, and bringing to light life and immortality.

   For the first, I shall shew,

   I. What is here meant by "the appearing of Jesus Christ."

   II. What by the abolishing of death.

   III. What by bringing to light life and immortality.

   I. What is here meant by "the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ."
   The Scripture useth several phrases to express this thing to us. As it
   was the gracious design of God the Father, so it is called the giving
   of his Son, or sending him into the world. (John iii. 16.) "God so
   loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son." (Ga. iv. 4.) "In
   the fulness of time God sent his Son." As it was the voluntary
   undertaking of God the Son, so it is called his coming into the world.
   In relation to his incarnation, whereby he was made visible to us in
   his body, and likewise in reference to the obscure promises, and
   prophecies, and types of the Old Testament, it is called his
   manifestation, or appearance. So the apostle expresseth it, (1 John
   iii. 5.) "Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins;" by
   which we are to understand primarily his incarnation, his appearing in
   our nature, whereby he became visible to us. As he was God, he could
   not appear to us, "dwelling in light and glory, not to be approached"
   by us in this state of mortality, and therefore he clothed himself in
   flesh, that he might appear and become manifest to us.

   I say, by his appearing, we are primarily to understand his
   incarnation: yet not only that, but likewise all that was consequent
   upon this, the actions of his life, and his death and resurrection;
   because all these concur to the producing of these happy effects
   mentioned in the text.

   II. What is meant by the abolishing of death, By this we are not to
   understand that Christ, by his appearance, hath rooted death out of the
   world, so that men are no longer subject to it. For we see that even
   good men, and those who are partakers of the benefits of Christ's
   death, are still subject to the common law of mortality; but this
   expression, of Christ's having abolished death, signifies the conquest
   and victory which Christ hath gained over death in his own person, in
   that after he was dead, and laid in his grave, he rose again from the
   dead, he freed himself from the bands of death, and broke loose from
   the fetters of it, they not being able to hold him, as the expression
   is; (Acts ii. 24.) and consequently hath, by this victory over it,
   given us an assurance of a resurrection to a better life. For since
   Christ hath abolished death, and triumphed over it, and thereby over
   the powers of darkness; (for so the apostle tells us, that by his
   death, and that which followed it, his resurrection from the dead, "he
   hath destroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devil:"
   the devil, he contributed all he could to the death of Christ, by
   tempting Judas to betray him, and engaging all his instruments in the
   procuring of it; as he had before brought in death into the world, by
   tempting the first man to sin, upon which death ensued; thus far he
   prevailed, and thought his kingdom was safe, having procured the death
   of him who was so great an enemy to it; but Christ, by rising from the
   dead, defeats the devil of his design, and plainly conquers him, who
   had arrogated to himself the power of death;) I say, since Christ hath
   thus vanquished death, and triumphed over it, and him that had the
   power of it, death hath lost its dominion, and Christ hath taken the
   whole power and disposal of it; as you find, Rev. i. 18. "I am he that
   liveth and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, and have the
   keys of hell and of death." Now Christ hath not only thus conquered
   death for himself, but likewise for all those who believe on him; so
   that death shall not be able to keep them for ever under its power: but
   Christ, by the same power whereby he raised up himself from the dead,
   will also "quicken our mortal bodies," and raise them up to a new life;
   for he keeps "the keys of hell and death;" and, as a reward of his
   sufferings and submission to death, he hath power conferred upon him,
   to give eternal life to as many as he pleases. In this sense, death,
   though it be not quite chased out of the world, yet it is virtually and
   in effect abolished by the appearance of Jesus Christ, having, in a
   great measure, lost its power and dominion; and since Christ hath
   assured us of a final rescue from it, the power of it is rendered
   insignificant and inconsiderable, and the sting and terror of it is
   taken away. So the apostle tells us in the forementioned place, (Heb.
   ii. 14, 15.) that Christ having, "by death, destroyed him who had the
   power of death, that is, the devil, he hath delivered those who,
   through fear of death, were all their life-time subject to bondage."
   And not only the power and terror of death is, for the present, in a
   great measure, taken away; but it shall at last be utterly destroyed.
   So the apostle tells us; (1 Cor. xv. 26.) "The last enemy that shall be
   destroyed is death;" which makes the apostle, in the latter end of this
   chapter, to break forth into that triumph: (ver. 54, 55.) "So when this
   corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have
   put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is
   written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting?
   O grave, where is thy victory?"

   III. What is here meant by bringing "life and immortality to light."
   Life and immortality is here by a frequent Hebraism put for immortal
   life; as also, immediately before the text, you find purpose and grace,
   put for God's gracious purpose. The phrase of bringing to light, is
   spoken of things which were before either wholly, or in a great measure
   hid, either were not at all discovered before, or not so clearly. Now,
   because the heathens, by the light of nature, bad some probable
   conjectures and hopes concerning another life after this, they were in
   some measure persuaded, that when men died they were not wholly
   extinguished, but did pass into another world, and did there receive
   rewards suited to their carriage and demeanour in this life; and
   because the Jews also, before Christ, had these natural suggestions and
   hopes strengthened and confirmed by revelations, which God made unto
   them under the Old Testament therefore we cannot understand this phrase
   of Christ's bringing immortal life to light absolutely, as if it were
   wholly a new discovery, which the world had no apprehension of before;
   but only comparatively, as a thing which was now rendered, by the
   coming of Christ into the world, incomparably more evident and
   manifest. Quicquid enim philosophi, quicquid rabini ea de re dicunt,
   tenebræ sunt, si ad evangelii lucem comparentur: "Whatever the
   philosophers, whatever the rabbins, say of this matter, is but
   darkness, compared to the clear light and revelation of the gospel." I
   proceed to the

   Second thing I proposed; viz. To shew what Christ's coming into the
   world hath done towards the abolishing of death, and the bringing of
   "life and immortality to light." I shall speak distinctly to these two:

   I. What Christ's appearance and coming into the world hath done towards
   the abolishing of death, or how death is abolished by the appearance of
   Christ. I have already shewn in the explication, that this phrase, the
   abolishing of death, signifies the conquest which he made over death in
   his own person for himself; the fruit of which victory redounds to us.
   For in that Christ, by his Divine power, did conquer it, and set
   himself free from the bands of it, this shews that the power of it is
   now brought into other hands, that "Christ hath the keys of hell and
   death;" so that though the devil, by tempting to sin, brought death
   into the world, yet it shall not be in his power to keep men always
   tinder the power of it; and hereby the terror of this great enemy is in
   a good measure taken away, and he shall at last be totally destroyed,
   by the same hand that hath already given him his mortal wound.

   Now this is said to be done by the appearing of Jesus Christ, forasmuch
   as, by his coming into the world, and taking our nature upon him, he
   became capable of encountering this enemy, and overcoming him, in such
   a manner, as might give us assurance of a final victory over it, and
   for the present comfort and encourage us against the fears of it. For,

   1. By taking our nature upon him, he became subject to the frailties
   and miseries of mortality, and liable to the suffering of death, by
   which expiation of sin was made. Sin was the cause of death. So the
   apostle tells us; "By man sin entered into the world, and death by sin,
   so that death came upon all." Now the way to cure this malady which was
   come upon our nature, and to remove this great mischief which was come
   into the world, is by taking away the meritorious cause of it, which is
   the guilt of sin. Now this Christ hath taken away by his death. Christ,
   that he might abolish death, hath appeared for the abolition of sin. So
   the apostle tells us; (Heb. ix. 26-28.) "But now once in the end of the
   world hath he appeared, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself,"
   eis athetesin hamartias, "for the abolishing of sin;" and to shew that
   this was intended as a remedy of the great mischief and in convenience
   of mortality, which sin had brought upon mankind, the apostle
   immediately adds, in the next verse, that "as it is appointed unto all
   men once to die, so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many;"
   and by his means the sting of death is taken away, and death in effect
   conquered; the consideration of which makes the apostle break out into
   that thankful triumph, (1 Cor. xv. 55-57.) "O death, where is thy
   sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; but
   thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
   Christ."

   2. As Christ, by taking our nature upon him, be came capable of
   suffering death, and thereby making expiation for sin; so by dying he
   became capable of rising again from the dead, whereby he hath gained a
   perfect victory and conquest over death and the powers of darkness. And
   this account the apostle gives us of Christ's taking our nature upon
   him, as being one of the principal ends and designs of it: (Heb. ii.
   14-16.) "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
   blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through
   death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the
   devil;" that is, that, by taking our nature upon him, he might be
   capable of encountering this enemy, that is, of encountering death in
   his own territories, and beating him in his own quarters; and by rising
   out of his grave, he might give us full and comfortable assurance of
   the possibility of being rescued from the power of the grave, and
   recovered out of the jaws of death. And therefore the wisdom of God
   pitched upon this way, as that which was most fit and proper to
   encourage and bear us up against the terrors of this enemy; and by
   giving us a lively instance and example of a victory over death,
   achieved by one clothed with mortality like ourselves, "we might have
   strong consolation and good hope through grace," and might be fully
   assured that he, who hath conquered this enemy for himself, was able
   also to conquer him for us, and to deliver us from the grave. Therefore
   the apostle reasons from the fitness and suitableness of this
   dispensation, as if no other argument could have been so proper to arm
   us against the fears of death, and to satisfy us that we should not
   always be held under the power of it; "Forasmuch as the children are
   partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the
   same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of
   death, and deliver them who through the fear of death," &c. The force
   of which argument is this: that seeing men are of a mortal nature (for
   that he means by being "partakers of flesh and blood,") nothing can be
   a greater comfort to us against the fears of death, than to see death
   conquered by flesh and blood, by one of the same nature with ourselves.
   Therefore the apostle adds, (ver. l6.) "For verily he took not on him
   the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham." If he had assumed the
   angelical nature, which is immortal, this would not have been so
   sensible a conviction to us of the possibility of it, as to have a
   lively instance and example presented us, of one in our nature
   conquering death, and triumphing over the grave. I proceed to the

   II. Second thing, What Christ hath done towards the bringing of "life
   and immortality to light." And because I told you that this is
   comparatively spoken, and signifies to us a greater degree of evidence,
   and a firmer assurance given us by the Christian religion, than the
   world had before, therefore it will be requisite to inquire into these
   two things:

   First, What assurance men had or might have had of the immortality of
   the soul and a future state, before the coming of Christ into the
   world, and the revelation of the gospel.

   Secondly, What greater evidence, and what higher degree of assurance,
   the gospel now gives us of immortal life; what greater arguments this
   new revelation and discovery of God to the world doth furnish us with,
   to persuade us of this matter, than the world was acquainted withal
   before.

   First, What assurance men had or might have had of the immortality of
   the soul, and consequently of a future state, before the revelation of
   the gospel by Christ's coming into the world. And here are two things
   distinctly to be considered.

   First, What arguments natural reason doth furnish us withal to persuade
   us of this principle, that our souls are immortal, and that there is
   another state remains for men after this life.

   Secondly, What assurance de facto the world had of this principle,
   before Christ's coming into the world: what the heathens, and what the
   Jews, had. The reason why I shall speak to these distinctly, is,
   because they are two very different inquiries--what assurance men might
   have had from the principles of natural reason concerning this matter,
   and what assurance they had de facto. I begin with the

   First, What arguments natural reason doth furnish us withal to persuade
   us to this principle, that our souls are immortal, and consequently
   that another state remains for men after this life. And here I shall
   shew,

   I. How much may be said for it.

   II. How little can be said against it. But before I come to speak
   particularly to the arguments, which natural reason affords us for the
   proof of this principle, I shall premise certain general
   considerations, which may give light and force to the following
   arguments. As,

   First, By the soul we mean a part of man distinct from his body, or a
   principle in him which is not matter. I choose rather to describe it
   this way, than by the essential properties of it, which are hard to fix
   upon, and are more remote from common apprehension. Our Saviour, when
   he would convince his disciples, after his resurrection, that the body
   wherein he appeared to them was a real body, and that he was not a
   spirit or apparition, he bids them touch and handle him; "For (says he)
   a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me to have." So that by
   the soul or spirit of a man, we mean some principle in man, which is
   really distinct from his visible and sensible part, from all that in
   man which affects our outward senses, and which is not to be described
   by any sensible and external qualities, such as we use to describe a
   body by: because it is supposed to be of such a nature, as does not
   fall under the cognizance and notice of any of our senses. And
   therefore I describe it, by removing from it all those qualities and
   properties which belong to that which falls under our senses; viz. that
   it is some thing in man distinct from his body, a principle in him
   which is not matter; that principle which is the cause of those several
   operations, which, by inward sense and experience, we are conscious to
   ourselves of; such are perception, understanding, memory, will. So that
   the most plain and popular notion that we can have of the soul is, that
   it is some thing in us which we never saw, and which is the cause of
   those effects which we find in ourselves; it is the principle whereby
   we are conscious to ourselves, that we perceive such and such objects,
   that we see, or hear, or perceive any thing by any other sense; it is
   that whereby we think and remember, whereby we reason about any thing,
   and do freely choose and refuse such things as are presented to us.
   These operations every one is conscious to himself of, and that which
   is the principle of these, or the cause from whence these proceed, is
   that which we mean by the soul.

   Secondly, By the immortality of the soul, I mean nothing else, but that
   it survives the body, that when the body dies and falls to the ground,
   yet this principle, which we call the soul, still remains and lives
   separate from it; that is, there is still a part of us which is free
   from the fate of the body, and continues to perform all those
   operations, to the performance of which the organs of the body are not
   necessary; that is, when our bodies are destitute of life, and become a
   dead carcass, there is still some thing that did belong to us, which
   retains the power of understanding, which thinks, and reasons, and
   remembers, and does all these freely.

   Thirdly, That he that goes about to prove the soul's immortality,
   supposeth the existence of a Deity, that there is a God. For although
   there be a very intimate and strict connexion between the two
   principles as to us, as being these two great pillars of all religion;
   yet that which is first and most fundamental to all religion, is the
   existence of a God; which, if it be not first proved, the best
   arguments for the soul's immortality lose their force. Therefore, as to
   the present argument, I suppose the being of God as a thing
   acknowledged, and not now to be proved; which I may the better do,
   having formerly endeavoured to make good this grand principle of
   religion, against the pretensions of the atheists.

   Fourthly, The existence of a God being supposed, this doth very much
   facilitate the other, of the soul's immortality. For this being an
   essential property of that Divine nature, that he is a spirit, that is,
   something that is not matter; it being once granted that God is, thus
   much is gained, that there is such a thing as a spirit, an immaterial
   substance, that is not liable to die or perish; so that he that goes
   about to prove the immortality of the soul, shall not need to prove
   that there may be such a thing as a spirit, that the notion of an
   immaterial substance does not imply a contradiction; because, supposing
   that there is a God, who is essentially a spirit, there can be no doubt
   of the possibility of such a thing as a spirit; and though there be
   this difference between God and all other spirits, that he is an
   infinite spirit, whereas others are but finite; yet no man that grants
   the existence of an infinite spirit, can with any pretence or colour of
   reason deny the possibility of a finite spirit.

   Fifthly, and lastly, It is highly reasonable that men should acquiesce
   and rest satisfied in such reasons and arguments for the proof of any
   thing, as the nature of the thing to be proved will bear; because there
   are several kinds and degrees of evidence, which all things are not
   equally capable of. It is sufficient that the evidence be such as the
   nature of the thing to be proved will admit of, and such as prudent men
   make no scruple to admit for sufficient evidence for things of the like
   nature, and such as, supposing the thing to be, we cannot ordinarily
   expect better, or greater evidence for it.

   There are two kinds of evidences, which are the highest and most
   satisfactory that this world affords to us; and those are, the evidence
   of sense, and mathematical demonstration. Now there are many things,
   concerning which the generality of men profess themselves to be well
   satisfied, which do not afford either of these kinds of evidence. There
   is none of us but doth firmly believe that we were born, though we do
   not remember any such thing; no man's memory does furnish him with the
   testimony of his senses for this matter, nor can any man prove this by
   a mathematical demonstration, nor by any necessary argument, so as to
   shew it impossible that the thing should be otherwise. For it is
   possible that a man may come into the world otherwise, than by the
   ordinary course of generation, as the first man did, who was created
   immediately by God; and yet I know no man in the world who doubts in
   the least concerning this matter, though he have no other argument for
   it, but the testimony of others, and his own observation, how other
   persons like himself came into the world. And it is reasonable to
   acquiesce in this evidence, because the nature of the thing affords no
   greater. We, who never were at Jerusalem, do firmly believe that there
   is such a place, upon the testimony and relation of others: and no man
   is blamed for this, as being over-credulous; because no man, that will
   not take the pains to go thither, can have any other greater evidence
   of it, than the general testimony of those who say they have seen it.
   And indeed almost all human affairs, I am sure the most important, are
   governed and conducted by such evidence, as falls very much short, both
   of the evidence of sense and of mathematical demonstration.

   To apply this then to my present purpose. That the soul of man is of an
   immortal nature, is not capable of all kinds and degrees of evidence.
   It can not be proved by our senses, nor is it reasonable to expect it
   should be so proved; because the soul is supposed, by every one that
   discourseth of it, to be a thing of such a nature, as cannot be seen or
   handled, or fall under any other of our senses: nor can it be proved to
   us by our own experience, while we are in this world; because whoever
   dies, which is the only trial that can be made whether our souls remain
   after our bodies, goes out of this world. As for mathematical
   demonstration, the nature of the thing renders it incapable of it. It
   remains, then, that we rest contented with such arguments as the nature
   of the thing will bear, and with such evidence as men are contented to
   accept of, and do account sufficient, in other matters: such evidence,
   as a prudent considering man, who is not credulous on the one hand, and
   on the other is not prejudiced by any interest against it, would rest
   satisfied in.

   Having premised these general considerations to clear my way, I now
   come to speak to the particular arguments, whereby the immortality of
   the soul may be made out to our reason. And the best way to estimate
   the force of the arguments which I shall bring for it, will be to
   consider beforehand with ourselves what evidence we can, in reason,
   expect for a thing of this nature. Suppose our souls be immortal; by
   what kind of arguments could we desire to be assured of it? Setting
   aside miracles and Divine revelation, could we desire more than this?

   I. That the thing be a natural notion and dictate of our minds.

   II. That it doth not contradict any other principle that nature hath
   planted in us, but does very well accord and agree with all other the
   most natural notions of our minds.

   III. That it be suitable to our natural fears and hopes.

   IV. That it tends to the happiness of man, and the good order and
   government of the world.

   V. That it gives the most rational account of all those inward actions
   which we are conscious to ourselves of, as perception, understanding,
   memory, will; which we cannot, without great unreasonableness, ascribe
   to matter as the cause of them. If all these be thus, as I shall
   endeavour to make it appear they are, what greater satisfaction could
   we desire to have of the immortality of our souls, than these arguments
   give us? I do not say that any one of these arguments doth sufficiently
   conclude this thing; nor is it necessary, that, taken singly and by
   themselves, they should do it; it is sufficient that they concur to
   make up one entire argument, which may be a sufficient evidence of the
   soul's immortality. To illustrate this by an instance: suppose a man
   should use these two arguments, to prove that such a man deserves to be
   credited in such a relation:--first, because he had sufficient
   knowledge of the thing he relates; and, secondly, because he is a man
   of integrity and fidelity. Neither of these alone would prove the man
   to be worthy of credit, though both together make up a good argument.
   So it is in these arguments which I have produced; it may be no one of
   them is a sufficient inducement, taken singly and by itself, to satisfy
   a man fully that the soul is immortal; and yet they may concur together
   to make a very powerful argument. I begin with the

   I. First, That our souls are of an immortal nature, that they do not
   die and perish with our bodies, but pass into another state upon the
   dissolution of our bodies, is a natural notion and dictate of our
   minds. That I call a natural notion, which the minds of all men do
   naturally hit upon and agree in, notwithstanding the distance and
   remoteness of the several parts of the world from one another,
   notwithstanding the different tempers, and manner and ways of
   education. The only way to measure whether any thing be natural or not,
   is by inquiring, whether it agree to the whole kind or not: if it do,
   then we call it natural. Omnium consensus naturæ vox est, "The consent
   of all is the voice of nature," says Tully, speaking of the universal
   agreement of all nations in this apprehension, that the souls of men
   remain after their bodies. And this he tells us he looks upon as a very
   great argument: Maximum vere argumentum est, naturam ipsam de
   immortalitate animarum tacitam judicare, quod omnibus curæ sint, et
   maxime quidem, quæ post mortem futura sunt: "This is a very great
   argument, that nature doth secretly, and in men's silent thoughts,
   deter mine the immortality of the soul, that all men are solicitous of
   what shall become of them after death." Nescio quomodo inhæret in
   mentibus quasi seculorum quoddam augurium futurorum, idque in maximis
   ingeniis altissimisque animis et existit maxime et apparet facillime:
   "I know not how (saith he) there sticks in the mind a certain kind of
   presage of a future state, and this is most deeply fixed, and discovers
   itself soonest in the choicest spirits." Again the same author, Ut deos
   esse natura opinamur, sic permanere animos arbitramur consensu nationum
   omnium: "As this opinion is planted in us by nature, that there is a
   God, by the consent of all nations we believe that souls remain after
   the body." I might multiply testimonies to this purpose out of the
   ancient heathen writers; but these which I have produced out of this
   great author are so plain and express, that I need bring no other.

   As for those barbarous nations which have been discovered in these
   latter ages of the world, and which, before the first planting of
   America, were never known to have held correspondence with these parts
   of the world, yet all those nations agree in this principle, of the
   immortality of the soul; nay, even the most barbarous of those nations,
   those who are most inhuman and eat one another, those of Joupinamboult,
   in Brasil, who are said by some authors, but I think not upon
   sufficient grounds, not to acknowledge the being of a God; yet even
   these (as Lerius tells us, who lived among them) had a very fixed and
   firm persuasion of this principle of religion, the immortality of the
   soul. "There is not (says he) any nation in the world more remote from
   all religion than these were; yet to shew that there is some light in
   the midst of this darkness, I can (says he) truly affirm, that they
   have not only some apprehensions of the immortality of the soul, but a
   most confident persuasion of it. Their opinion (says he) is, that the
   souls of stout and valiant men after death fly beyond the highest
   mountains, and there are gathered to their fathers and grandfathers,
   and live in pleasant gardens, with all manner of delights; but the
   souls of slothful and in active men, and those who do nothing for their
   country, are carried to Aygman (so they call the devil) and live with
   him in perpetual torments." The like Xaverius and others, who laboured
   in the conversion of the remote parts of the East Indies, tell us
   concerning those nations, that they found them generally possessed with
   this principle, of the soul's immortality.

   Now what will we call a natural notion, if not that which mankind, in
   all places of the world, in all ages, so far as history informs, did
   universally agree in? What evidence greater than this can any man give,
   to shew that any thing is natural? And if we believe a God (which I
   told you I do all along in this argument suppose to be already proved),
   can we imagine that this wise and good God would plant such a notion
   and apprehension in the understandings of men, as would put an
   universal cheat and delusion upon human nature?

   And that the universal consent of all nations in this principle cannot
   be resolved either into the fears and groundless jealousy and
   superstition of human nature, nor into universal tradition, which had
   its original from some impostor, nor into reason and policy of state, I
   might shew particularly: but, having formerly done that, concerning the
   universal consent of all nations in the belief of a God, and the reason
   being the very same, as to this principle of the immortality of the
   soul, I shall not need to do this over again upon this argument.

   And that some persons, and particular sects in the world, have disowned
   this principle, is no sufficient objection against it. It cannot be
   denied, but the Epicureans among the philosophers did renounce this
   principle; and some also among the stoics do speak doubtfully of it.
   The Sadducees, likewise, among the Jews fell into this error, upon a
   mistake and misapprehension of the doctrine of their master, Sadoc,
   who, as Josephus tells us, did use to inculcate this principle to his
   scholars, that though there were no rewards nor punishments after this
   life, yet men ought to be good and live virtuously; from whence, in
   process of time, by heat of opposition against the pharisees, who
   brought in oral tradition, and made it equal with the written word of
   God, they fell into that error, and denied the soul's immortality, not
   finding such clear texts for it in the Old Testament as to them did
   seem fully convincing of this truth. Xaverius likewise tells us, that
   among the several sects of religion which he found in Japan, there was
   one which denied the immortality of the soul, and that there were any
   spirits; but he says they were a sort of notoriously wicked and vicious
   persons.

   To these instances, which are so few, and bear no proportion to the
   generality of mankind, I have these two things to say:

   1. That no argument can be drawn a monstro ad naturam. A thing may be
   natural, and yet some instances may be brought to the contrary: but
   these are but few in comparison, and like monsters, which are no
   argument against nature. No man will deny that it is natural for men to
   have two eyes, and five fingers upon a hand; though there are several
   instances of men born but with one eye, and with four or six fingers.

   2. But especially in matters of religion and discourse, which are
   subject to liberty, men may offer violence to nature, and, to gratify
   their lusts and interests, may by false reasonings debauch their
   understanding, and by long striving against the natural bent and bias
   of it, may alter their apprehensions of things, and persuade others to
   the same: but nothing that is against nature can prevail very far, but
   nature will still be endeavouring to recover itself, and to free itself
   from the violence which is offered to it. So that men's understandings,
   left to themselves, and not having some false bias put upon them, out
   of a design of pride, and singularity in opinion, which was the case of
   Epicurus; or out of the interest of some lust, and a design to set men
   at liberty to sin, which is the case of most who have renounced this
   principle: I say, nothing but one of these two can ordinarily make men
   deny the immortality of the soul. Thus I have done with the first
   argument; namely, that the immortality of the soul is a natural notion
   and dictate of our minds.

SERMON CLXXIV.

  OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, AS DISCOVERED BY NATURE AND BY REVELATION.

   But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
   who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to
   light through the gospel.--2 Tim. i. 10.

   I PROCEED to the second argument, that this notion or principle of the
   immortality of the soul, doth not contradict any other principle that
   nature hath planted in us, but doth very well accord and agree with all
   those other notions which are most natural. I shall mention two, which
   seem to be the most natural notions that we have, and the most deeply
   rooted in our natures; the one is the existence and the perfections of
   God; and the other the difference of good and evil. Mankind do
   universally agree in these two principles, that there is a God who is
   essentially good and just, and that there is a real difference between
   good and evil, which is not founded in the opinion and imaginations of
   persons, or in the custom and usage of the world, but in the nature of
   things. Now this principle of the immortality of the soul, and future
   rewards after this life, is so far from clashing with either of these
   principles, that the contrary assertion, viz. that our souls are
   mortal, and that there is nothing to be hoped for, or feared, beyond
   this life, would very much contradict those other principles. To shew
   this then particularly,

   1. The immortality of the soul is very agreeable to the natural notion
   which we have of God, one part whereof is, that he is essentially good
   and just.

   (1.) For his goodness. It is very agreeable to that, to think that God
   would make some creatures for as long a duration as they are capable
   of. The wisdom of God hath chosen to display itself, in creating
   variety of things of different degrees and perfections; things devoid
   of life and sense; and several degrees and orders of sensitive
   creatures, of different shapes and figures, of different magnitude;
   some vastly great, others extremely little, others of middle sort
   between these. And himself being a pure spirit, we have no reason to
   doubt, but he could make creatures of a spiritual nature, and such as
   should have no principle of self-corruption in them. And seeing he
   could make creatures of such perfection, if we believe him to be
   essentially good, we have no reason to doubt, but that he hath done so.
   For it is the very nature of goodness to communicate and diffuse
   itself, and to delight in doing so; and we cannot imagine, but that the
   same goodness which prompted and inclined him to give being to those
   creatures which are of an inferior degree of perfection, would move him
   likewise to make creatures more perfect, and capable of greater degrees
   of happiness, and of a longer enjoyment of it, if it were in his power
   to make such; and no man that believes the omnipotency of God can doubt
   of this. For he who by a pure act of his will can command things to be,
   and in an instant to start out of nothing, can as easily make one sort
   of creatures as another. Now the power of God being supposed, his
   goodness secures us of his will: for we cannot imagine any such thing
   as envy in a Being which we suppose to be perfectly good; no thing
   being more inconsistent with perfect goodness, than to be unwilling to
   communicate happiness to others, and to grudge that others should
   partake of it.

   Now this being supposed, that God could and would make creatures of a
   spiritual and immortal nature, and the utmost imaginable perfections of
   such creatures being knowledge and liberty, wherever these perfections
   are found, we have reason to conclude that creature to be endowed with
   a principle that is of a spiritual and immortal nature. Now these
   perfections of understanding and will being found in man, this argues
   him to be endowed with such a principle, as is in his own nature
   capable of an immortal duration.

   It is true, indeed, this spiritual part of man, which we call his soul,
   is united to a visible and material part, viz. his body; the union of
   which parts constitutes a peculiar sort of creature, which is utriusque
   mundi nexus, unites the material and immaterial world, the world of
   matter and of spirits. And as it is very suitable to the wisdom of God,
   which delights in variety, that there should be a sort of creatures
   compounded of both these principles, matter and spirit; so it is very
   agreeable to his goodness to think, that he would design such creatures
   for as long a duration and continuance as they were capable of. For as
   it is the effects of goodness to bring creatures forth into the
   possession of that life and happiness which they are capable of; so to
   continue them in the enjoyment of it for so long as they are capable.

   The sum of all this is, that as it is agreeable to the wisdom of God,
   which made the world, to display itself in all variety of creatures; so
   it is agree able to his goodness, to make some of as perfect a kind as
   creatures are capable of being. Now it being no repugnancy nor
   contradiction, that a creature should be of a spiritual and immortal
   nature, we have no reason to think, but that the fruitfulness of the
   Divine goodness hath brought forth such creatures; and if there be
   reason to conclude any thing to be of a spiritual and immortal nature,
   certainly the principle of understanding and liberty, which we are
   conscious of in ourselves, deserves to be reputed such.

   (2.) It is very agreeable to the justice of God, to think the souls of
   men remain after this life, that there may be a state of reward and
   recompence in another world. If we believe God to be holy and just, we
   cannot but believe that he loves righteousness and goodness, and hates
   iniquity; and that, as he is governor and public magistrate of the
   world, he is concerned to countenance and encourage the one, and to
   discountenance and discourage the other. Now the providences of God
   being in a great measure promiscuously administered in this world, so
   that no man can make any certain judgment of God's love and hatred
   towards persons by what befals them in this world, it being the lot of
   good men many times to suffer and be afflicted, and of wicked men to
   live in a flourishing and prosperous condition; I say, things being
   thus, it is very agreeable to those notions which we have of the Divine
   holiness and justice, to believe that there will a time come, when this
   wise and just Governor of the world will make a wide and visible
   difference between the righteous and the wicked; so that though for a
   while the justice of God may be clouded, yet there will a time come
   when it shall be clearly manifested, and every eye see it and bear
   witness to it; when "judgment shall break forth as the light, and
   righteousness as the noon-day." It is possible that sin for a while may
   go unpunished, nay, triumph and prosper; and that virtue and innocence
   may not only be unrewarded, but oppressed, and despised, and
   persecuted. And this may be reconcileable enough to the wisdom of God's
   providence and the justice of it, supposing the immortality of the
   soul, and another state after this life, wherein all things shall be
   set straight, and every man shall receive according to his works: but
   unless this be supposed, it is impossible to solve the justice of God's
   providence. Who will believe that the affairs of the world are
   administered by him who loves righteousness, and hates all the workers
   of iniquity, who will not let the least service that is done to him
   pass unrewarded, nor, on the other hand, acquit the guilty, and let sin
   go unpunished, which are the properties of justice; I say, who will
   believe this, that looks into the course of the world, and sees with
   how little difference and distinction of good and bad the affairs of it
   are managed? That sees virtue discountenanced and despised, poor and
   destitute, afflicted and tormented; when wickedness is many times
   exalted to high places, and makes a great noise and ruffle in the
   world? He that considers what a hazard many times good men run, how for
   goodness' sake they venture, and many times quit all the contentments
   and enjoyments of this life, and submit to the greatest sufferings and
   calamities that human nature is capable of; while in the mean time
   prosperity is poured into the lap of the wicked, and Heaven seems to
   look pleasantly upon those that deal treacherously, and to be silent
   whilst the wicked devours the man that is more righteous than himself;
   he that considers this, and can, without supposing another life after
   this, pretend to vindicate the justice of these things, must he as
   blind as the fortune that governs them. Would not this be a perpetual
   stain and blemish upon the Divine Providence, that Abel, who offered up
   a better sacrifice than Cain, and "had this testimony, that he pleased
   God;" yet, after all this, should have no other reward for it, but to
   be slain by his brother, who had offender! God by a slight and
   contemptuous offering? If there were no reward to be expected after
   this life, would not this have been a sad example to the world, to see
   one of the first men that served God acceptably thus rewarded? What a
   pitiful encouragement would it be to men to be good, to see profane
   Esau blessed with the dew of heaven, and fatness of the earth; and to
   hear good old Jacob, in the end and conclusion of his days, to
   complain, "Few and evil have the days of my pilgrimage been!" If this
   had been the end of Esau and Jacob, it would puzzle all the wit and
   reason of mankind to wipe off this reproach from the providence of God,
   and vindicate the justice of it. And therefore I do not wonder, that
   the greatest wits among the heathen philosophers were so much puzzled
   with this objection against the providence of God--If the wise, and
   just, and good God do administer the affairs of the world, and be
   concerned in the good or bad actions of men, cur bonis male et malis
   bene? "How comes it to pass, that good men many times are miserable,
   and bad men so happy in the world?" And they had no other way to wipe
   off this objection, but by referring these things to another world,
   wherein the temporal sufferings of good men should he eternally
   rewarded, and the short and transient happiness of wicked men should be
   rendered insignificant, and drowned in an eternity of misery.

   So that, if we believe the being of God, and the providence of God
   (which I do all along take for granted in this argument), there is no
   other way imaginable to solve the equity and justice of God's
   providence, but upon this supposition--that there is an other life
   after this. For to say, that virtue is a sufficient and abundant reward
   for itself, though it have some truth in it, if we set aside those
   sufferings, and miseries, and calamities, which virtue is frequently
   attended with in this life; yet, if these be taken in, it is but a very
   jejune and dry speculation. For considering the strong propension and
   inclination of human nature to avoid these evils and inconveniencies, a
   state of virtue attended with great sufferings, would be so far from
   being a happiness, that it would be a real misery; so that the
   determination of the apostle (1 Cor. xv. 19.) is according to nature,
   and the truth and reason of things, that, "If in this life only we had
   hope, we were of all men most miserable." For although it be true,
   that, as things now stand, and as the nature of man is framed, good men
   do find a strange kind of inward pleasure and secret satisfaction of
   mind in the discharge of their duty, and doing what is virtuous; yet
   every man that looks into himself and consults his own breast, will
   find that this delight and contentment springs chiefly from the hopes
   which men conceive, that a holy and virtuous life shall not be
   unrewarded: and without these hopes virtue is but a dead and empty
   name; and notwithstanding the reasonableness of virtuous actions
   compared with the contrary of them, yet when virtue came to be
   incumbered with difficulties, and to be attended with such sufferings
   and inconveniencies, as were grievous and intolerable to human nature,
   then it would appear unreasonable to choose that for a happiness, which
   would rob a man of all the felicity of his life. For though a man were
   never so much in love with virtue for the native beauty and comeliness
   of it; yet it would strangely cool his affection to it, to consider
   that he should be undone by the match; that when he had it, he must go
   a begging with it, and be in danger of death, for the sake of that
   which he had chosen for the felicity of his life. So that, how devout
   soever the woman might be, yet I dare say she was not over-wise and
   considerate, who, going about with a pitcher of water in one hand, and
   a pan of coals in the other, and being asked what she intended to do
   with them, answered, that she intended with the one to burn up heaven,
   and with the other to quench hell, that men might love God and virtue
   for their own sakes, without hope of reward or fear of punishment.

   And the consequence of this dry doctrine does sufficiently appear in
   the sect of the Sadducees, which had its rise from this principle of
   Sadoc, the master of the sect, who, out of an indiscreet zeal to teach
   something above others, and indeed above the pitch of human nature,
   inculcated this doctrine upon his scholars--that religion and virtue
   ought to be loved for themselves, though there were no reward of virtue
   to be hoped, nor punishment of vice to be feared, in another world;
   from which his disciples inferred, that it was not necessary to
   religion to believe a future state, and, in process of time,
   peremptorily maintained, that there was no life after this. For they
   did not only deny the resurrection of the body, but, as St. Paul tells
   us, they said, that "there was neither angel nor spirit;" that is, they
   denied that there was any thing of an immortal nature, that did remain
   after this life. And what the consequence of this was, we may see in
   the character which Josephus gives of that sect; for he tells, that the
   commonalty of the Jews were of the sect of the Pharisees, but most of
   the great and rich men were Sadducees; which plainly shews, that this
   dry speculation, of loving religion and virtue for themselves, without
   any expectation of future rewards, did end in their giving over all
   serious pursuit of religion; and, because they hoped for nothing after
   this life, therefore laying aside all other considerations, they
   applied themselves to the present business of this life, and grasped as
   much of the present enjoyments of its power and riches, as they could
   by any means attain to.

   And for a farther evidence of this, that it is only or principally the
   hopes of a future happiness that bear men up in the pursuit of virtue,
   that give them so much comfort and satisfaction in the prosecution of
   it, and make men encounter the difficulties, and oppositions, and
   persecutions they meet withal in the ways of religion, with so much
   undauntedness and courage; I say, for the farther evidence of this, I
   shall only offer this consideration--that, according to the degree of
   this hope and assurance of another life, men's constancy and courage in
   the ways of virtue and religion have been. Before Christ's coming into
   the world, and the bringing of" life and immortality to light by the
   gospel," we do not find in all ages of the world, so many instances of
   patience and constant suffering for religion, as happened in the first
   age after Christ. God did not think fit to try the world so much in
   this kind, till they were furnished with a principle which would bear
   them up tinder the greatest sufferings, which was nothing else but the
   full assurance which the gospel gave the world of a blessed immortality
   after this life; the firm belief and persuasion of which, made
   Christians dead to the world, and all the contentments and enjoyments
   of it, and by raising them above all the pleasures and terrors of
   sense, made them to despise present things, "in hopes of eternal life,
   which God that could not lie had promised." This was that which set
   them above the fears of death, so that they were not to be frightened
   out of their religion by the most exquisite torments, and all the most
   horrid and fearful shapes, that the malice of men and devils could
   dress up misery and affliction in. Whereas, under the old dispensation
   of the law, before the revelation of the gospel, when the promises of
   eternal life were not so clear, and men's hopes of it more weak and
   faint, the express encouragement to obedience was founded in the
   promises of temporal blessings; God herein complying with the necessity
   of human nature, which is not to be wrought upon to any great purpose,
   but by arguments of advantage.

   The sum of this argument, which I have thus largely dilated upon,
   because I look upon it as one of the most strong and convincing of the
   soul's immortality, is this; that the justice of God's providence
   cannot sufficiently be vindicated, but upon the supposal of this
   principle of the soul's immortality: whereas, if this principle be
   admitted, that men pass out of this life into an eternal state of
   happiness or misery, according as they have behaved themselves in this
   world; then the account of the unequal providences of God in this world
   is easy. For if we look upon this life as a state of probation, of
   trial to wicked men, and of exercise to good men, in order to a future
   and eternal state; and if we consider withal, how vast the difference
   is between time and eternity; it will be easy then to apprehend how all
   things may be set straight in another world, and how the righteousness
   of God may appear, in giving an abundant recompence to good men for all
   their temporal service and sufferings, which do but prepare them the
   more for a quicker relish of the glory and happiness which is reserved
   for them; and, on the other hand, in punishing wicked men, whose short
   ease and prosperity in this world will, by the just judgment of God for
   their abuse of the blessings of this life, set out their misery and
   torment to the greatest disadvantage. For, as nothing commends
   happiness more than precedent sorrow; so nothing makes pain and
   suffering more bitter and intolerable, than to step into them out of a
   state of ease and pleasure; so that the pleasures and prosperity of
   wicked men in this life, considered with the punishment of the next,
   which will follow upon them, is an addition to their misery. This is
   the very sting of the second death; and in this sense also that of the
   wise man is true--"The ease of the simple will slay them;" and the
   prosperity of these fools shall be the great aggravation of their
   destruction.

   2. Another notion which is deeply rooted in the nature of man, is, that
   there is a difference between good and evil, which is not founded in
   the imagination of persons, or in the custom and usage of the world,
   but in the nature of things: that there are some things which have a
   natural evil, and turpitude, and deformity in them; for example,
   impiety and profaneness towards God, injustice and unrighteousness
   towards men, perfidiousness, injury, ingratitude; these are things that
   are not only condemned by the positive laws and constitutions of
   particular nations and governments, but by the general verdict and
   sentiments of humanity. Piety and religion towards God; justice, and
   righteousness, and fidelity, and reverence of oaths; regard to a man's
   word and promise; and gratitude towards those who have obliged us;
   these and the like qualities, which we call virtues, are not only well
   spoken of, where they are countenanced by the authority of law, but
   have the tacit approbation and veneration of mankind. And any man that
   thinks that these things are not naturally and in themselves good, but
   are merely arbitrary, and depend upon the pleasure of authority, and
   the will of those who have the power of imposing laws upon others; I
   say, any such person may easily be convinced of his error, by putting
   this supposition:--suppose wickedness were established by a law, and
   the practice of fraud, and rapine, and perjury, falseness in a man's
   word and promises, were commended and rewarded; and it were made a
   crime for any man to be honest, to have any regard to his oath or
   promise; and the man that should dare to be honest, or make good his
   word, should be severely punished, and made a public example; I say,
   suppose the reverse of all that which we now call virtue were solemnly
   enacted by a law, and public authority should enjoin the practice of
   that which we call vice; what would the consequence of this be, when
   the tables were thus turned? Would that which we now call vice gain the
   esteem and reputation of virtue; and those things which we now call
   virtue, grow contemptible and become odious to human nature? If not,
   then there is a natural and intrinsical difference between good and
   evil, between virtue and vice; there is something in the nature of
   these things which does not depend upon arbitrary constitution. And I
   think nothing can be more evident, than that the authority which should
   attempt such an establishment, would there by be rendered ridiculous,
   and all laws of such a tendency as this would be hissed out of the
   world. And the reason of this is plain, because no government could
   subsist upon these terms: for the very forbidding men to be just and
   honest, the enjoining of fraud, and violence, and perjury, and breach
   of trust, would apparently destroy the end of government, which is to
   preserve men and their rights against the encroachments and
   inconveniences of these: and this end being destroyed, human society
   would presently disband, and men would naturally fall into a state of
   war: which plainly shews that there is a natural, and immutable, and
   eternal reason for that which we call goodness and virtue; and against
   that which we call vice and wickedness.

   To come then to my purpose, it is very agreeable to this natural notion
   of the difference between good and evil, to believe the soul's
   immortality. For no thing is more reasonable to imagine, than that good
   and evil, as they are differenced in their nature, so they shall be in
   their rewards; that it shall one time or other be well to them that do
   well, and evil to the wicked man. Now seeing this difference is not
   made in this world, but all things happen alike to all, the belief of
   this difference between good and evil, and the different rewards
   belonging to them infers another state after this life, which is the
   very thing we mean by the soul's immortality; namely, that it does not
   die with the body, but remains after it, and passeth into a state
   wherein it shall receive a reward suitable to the actions of this life.

   And thus I have done with the second argument for the soul's
   immortality; namely, that this principle doth not contradict those
   other principles which nature hath planted in us, but doth very well
   accord and agree with those natural notions which we have of the
   goodness of God, and of the justice of his providence, and of the real
   and intrinsical difference between good and evil.

   III. This principle, of the soul's immortality, is suitable to the
   natural hopes and fears of men.

   To the natural hopes of men. Whence is it that men are so desirous to
   purchase a lasting fame, and to perpetuate their memory to posterity,
   but that they hope that there is something belonging to them, which
   shall survive the fate of the body, and when that lies in the silent
   grave, shall be sensible of the honour which is done to their memory,
   and shall enjoy the pleasure of the just and impartial fame, which
   shall speak of them to posterity without envy or flattery? And this is
   a thing incident to the great est and most generous spirits; none so
   apt as they to feed themselves with these hopes of immortality. What
   was it made those great spirits among the Romans so freely to sacrifice
   their lives for the safety of their country, but an ambition that their
   names might live after them, and be mentioned with honour when they
   were dead and gone? Which ambition of theirs, had it not been grounded
   in the hopes of immortality, and a natural opinion of another life
   after this, in which they might enjoy the delight and satisfaction of
   the fame which they had purchased, nothing could have been more vain
   and unreasonable. If there were no hopes of a life beyond this, what is
   there in fame that should tempt any man to forego this present life,
   with all the contentments and enjoyments of it? What is the pleasure of
   being well spoken of, when a man is not? What is the happiness which
   men can promise to themselves, when they are out of being, when they
   can enjoy nothing, nor be sensible of any thing, because they are not?
   So that the spring of all those brave and gallant actions, which the
   heathens did with the hazard of their lives, out of a desire of
   after-fame and glory; I say, the spring of all those actions, could be
   no other than the hopes of another life after this, in which they made
   account to enjoy the pleasure of the fame, which they purchased with
   the expense and loss of this present life.

   But this ardent desire and impatient thirst after fame, concerns but a
   few of mankind in comparison. I shall therefore instance in something
   which is more common and general to mankind, which plainly argues this
   hope of immortality. What is the ground of that peace, and quiet, and
   satisfaction, which good men find in good and virtuous actions, but
   that they have a secret persuasion, and comfortable hopes, that they
   shall sometime or other be rewarded? and we find that they maintain
   these even when they despair of any reward in this world. Now what do
   these hopes argue, but a secret belief of a future state, and another
   life after this, wherein men shall receive the reward of their actions,
   and inherit the fruit of their doings? Whence is it else, that good
   men, though they find that goodness suffers, and is persecuted in this
   world, and that the best designs are many times unsuccessful; what is
   it that bears them up under these disappointments, and makes them
   constant in a virtuous course, but this hope of another life, in a
   better state of things hereafter? They have some secret presage in
   their own minds of a life after death, which will be a time of
   recompence, as this is of trial.

   2. The same may be argued from the natural fears of men. Whence is the
   secret shame, and fear, and horror, which seizeth upon the minds of
   men, when they are about a wicked action; yea, though no eye see them,
   and though what they are doing do not fall under the cognizance of any
   human court or tribunal? Whence is it that they meet with such checks
   and rebukes in their own spirits, and feel such a disturbance and
   confusion in their minds, when they do a vile and unworthy thing; yea,
   al though it be so secretly contrived and so privately managed, that no
   man can charge them with it, or call them to account for it? What art
   thou afraid of, man, if there be no life after this? Why do thy joints
   tremble, and thy knees knock together, if thou beest in no danger from
   any thing in this world, and hast no fears of the other? If men had not
   a natural dread of another world, and sad and dreadful presages of
   future vengeance, why do not men sin with assurance when no eye sees
   them? Why are not men secure, when they have only imagined a mischief
   privately in their own hearts, and no creature is privy and conscious
   to it? Why do men's own consciences lash and sting them for these
   things, which they might do with as great impunity from men in this
   world, as the most virtuous actions? Whence is it that cogitare,
   peccare est, as Min. Felix expresseth it, et non solum conscios timet,
   sed et conscientiam? Whence is it that "a wicked man is guilty upon
   account merely of his thoughts, and is not only fearful because of
   those things which others are conscious of, but because of those things
   which nobody knows but his own conscience?" Whence is it that,


   Scelus intra se tacitum qui cogitat ullum,

   Facti crimen habet?

   That "he that does but devise and imagine secret mischief in his heart,
   is guilty to himself, as if the fact had been committed?" And when no
   man can charge and accuse him for it, yet,


   Nocte dieque suum gestat in pectore testem:

   "He carries his accuser in his breast, who does night and day
   incessantly witness against him?"

   And that these fears are natural, the sudden rise of them is a good
   evidence, They do not proceed from deliberation, men do not reason
   themselves into these fears, but they spring up in men's minds they
   know not how; which shews that they are natural. Now, a man's natural
   actions, I mean, such as surprise us, and do not proceed from
   deliberation, are better arguments of the intimate sense of our minds,
   and do more truly discover the bottom of our hearts, and those notions
   that are implanted in our natures, than those actions which are
   governed by reason and discourse, and proceed from deliberation. To
   demonstrate this by an instance: if a man upon a sudden sight of a
   snake, do recoil and start back, tremble and grow pale; this is a
   better argument of a natural antipathy and fear, than it is of a
   natural courage, if afterward, when he hath commanded down his fear, he
   should by his reason persuade himself to take up the snake into his
   hand. If you would know what a man's natural apprehensions are, take
   him on the sudden, and give him no time to deliberate. Therefore, some
   cunning politicians have used this way of surprise and sudden
   questions, to dive into the hearts of men, and discover their secrets.

   In like manner, if you would know what men's natural apprehensions are
   concerning the immortality of the soul, and a future state, observe
   what men's first thoughts are, whether a man's conscience does not
   suggest to him such fears upon the commission of sin. There is no doubt
   but men may offer violence to their natures, and reason themselves into
   great doubts about the soul's immortality; nay, men may be bribed into
   the contrary opinion: but this man who, in his deliberate discourses,
   denies any reward after this life, shall, by his natural actions,
   acknowledge them, by those fears and terrors, which his guilty
   conscience is ever and anon surprised withal.

   The sum of this argument is, that it is natural for men that live
   piously and virtuously, that do just, and honest, and worthy actions,
   to conceive good hopes that it shall some time or other be well with
   them; that however they may meet with no reward and recompence in this
   world, yet "verily there will be a reward for the righteous:" and, on
   the other hand, wicked men, though they flourish and prosper in their
   wickedness, yet they are not free from guilt, they are fearful and
   timorous, even when their condition sets them above the fear of any man
   upon earth. Now, what does this signify, but that they have some secret
   presages of an after-punishment? Nature suggests this thought to them,
   that there will be a time when all the sins which they have committed,
   and the wickedness which they have done, shall be accounted for.

   And it is no prejudice to this truth, that some men sin against their
   consciences, and by frequent acts of sin, and offering notorious
   violence to their own light, bring themselves into a brawny and in
   sensible condition, so that they have not those stings and lashes, are
   not haunted with those fears and terrors, which pursue common sinners.
   This is but reasonable to be expected, that men, by frequent acts of
   sin, should lose the tender sense which men's consciences naturally
   have of good and evil; that men that lay waste their consciences by
   gross and notorious sins, should lose the sense of good and evil, and
   that their consciences should grow hard, like a beaten road; nay, it is
   suitable to the justice of God, to give up such persons to a reprobate
   sense, to an injudicious mind, that they, who would not be awakened and
   reclaimed by the natural fear of Divine justice, which God hath hid in
   every man's conscience, should at last lose all sense and apprehension
   of these things, and be permitted securely and without remorse to
   perfect their own ruin.

   IV. This doctrine of the immortality of the soul, does evidently tend
   to the happiness and perfection of man, and to the good order and
   government of the world: to the happiness and perfection of man, both
   considered singly, and in society.

   1. To the happiness and perfection of man, considered in his single
   capacity, if it be a thing desirable to be at all, then it is a thing
   desirable to be continued in being as long as may be, and for ever if
   it be possible. If life be a perfection, then eternal life is much more
   so; especially if the circumstances of this present life be considered,
   together with the state which we hope for hereafter. The condition of
   men in this present life, is attended with so many frailties, liable to
   so great miseries and sufferings, to so many pains and diseases, to
   such various causes of sorrow and trouble, of fear and vexation, by
   reason of the many hazards and uncertainties, which not only the
   comforts and contentments of our lives, but even life itself, is liable
   to, that the pleasure and happiness of it is by these very much
   rebated; so that were not men trained on with the hopes of something
   better hereafter, life itself would to many men bean insupportable
   burden: if men were not supported and borne up under the anxieties of
   this present life, with the hopes and expectations of a happier state
   in another world, mankind would be the most imperfect and unhappy part
   of God's creation. For although other creatures be subjected to a great
   deal of vanity and misery, yet they have this happiness that as they
   are made for a short duration and continuance, so they are only
   affected with the present, they do not fret and discontent themselves
   about the future, they are not liable to be cheated with hopes, nor
   tormented with fears, nor vexed at disappointments, as the sons of men
   are.

   But if our souls be immortal, this makes abundant amends and
   compensation for the frailties of this life, and all the transitory
   sufferings and inconveniences of this present state; human nature,
   considered with this advantage, is infinitely above the brute beasts
   that perish.

   As for those torments and miseries which we are liable to in another
   world, far greater than any thing that men suffer in this life, this
   ought not, in reason, to be objected against the immortality of the
   soul, as if this doctrine did not tend to the happiness and perfection
   of man: for if this be truly the case of mankind, that God hath made
   men's souls of an immortal nature, and designed them for a perpetual
   duration and continuance in another state after this life, in order to
   which state he hath placed every man in this world, to be, as it were,
   a candidate for eternity, he hath furnished every man with such helps
   and advantages, such opportunities and means for the attaining of
   everlasting happiness, that if he be not grossly wanting to himself, he
   shall not miscarry; if this be the case, then an immortal nature is a
   real and mighty privilege. If God puts every man into a capacity of
   happiness, and if no man becomes miserable but by his own choice, if no
   man falls short of eternal happiness but by his own fault, then
   immortality is a privilege in itself, and a curse to none but those who
   make it so to themselves.

   2. This doctrine tends to the happiness of man considered in society,
   to the good order and government of the world. I do not deny, but if
   this principle of the immortality of the soul were not believed in the
   world, if the generality of mankind had no regard to any thing beyond
   this present life: I say, I do not deny, notwithstanding this, but
   there would be some kind of government kept up in the world; the
   necessities of human nature, and the mischiefs of contention, would
   compel men to some kind of order: but I say withal, that if this
   principle were banished out of the world, government would want its
   most firm basis and foundation; there would be infinitely more
   disorders in the world were men not restrained from injustice and
   violence by principles of conscience, and the awe of another world. And
   that this is so, is evident from hence, that all magistrates think
   themselves concerned to cherish religion, and to maintain in the minds
   of men the belief of a God, and of a future state.

   This is the fourth argument--that this doctrine does evidently tend to
   the happiness of man, and the good order and government of the world. I
   grant that this argument alone, and taken singly by itself, is far from
   enforcing and necessarily concluding the soul's immortality: but if the
   other arguments be of force to conclude, this added to them is a very
   proper inducement to persuade and incline men to the belief of this
   principle; it does very well serve the purpose for which I bring it;
   namely, to shew, that if there be good arguments for it, no man hath
   reason to be averse or backward to the belief of it; if by other
   arguments we be convinced of the suitableness of this principle to
   reason, this consideration will satisfy us, that it is not against our
   interest to entertain it. And no man that is not resolved to live
   wickedly, hath reason to desire that the contrary should be true. For
   what would a man gain by it, if the soul were not immortal, but to
   level himself with the beasts that perish, and to put himself into a
   worse and more miserable condition than any of the creatures below him?

SERMON CLXXV.

  OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, AS DISCOVERED BY NATURE AND BY REVELATION.

   But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour, Jesus Christ,
   who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to
   light through the gospel.--2 Tim. i. 10.

   THE fifth and last argument is, That this supposition of the soul's
   immortality, gives the fairest account and easiest solution of the
   phenomena of human nature, of those several actions and operations
   which we are conscious to ourselves of, and which, without great
   violence to our reason, cannot be resolved into a bodily principle, and
   ascribed to mere matter; such are perception, memory, liberty, and the
   several acts of understanding and reason. These operations we find in
   ourselves, and we cannot imagine how they should be performed by mere
   mat ter; therefore we ought, in all reason, to resolve them into some
   principle of another nature from matter, that is, into something that
   is immaterial, and consequently immortal, that is incapable in its own
   nature of corruption and dissolution.

   And that the force of this argument may the better appear, I shall
   speak something of these distinctly, and shew that none of these
   operations can be performed from mere matter. I begin with the

   1. First and lowest, which is sensitive perception, which is nothing
   else but a consciousness to ourselves of our own sensations, an
   apprehension of the impressions which are made upon us; and this
   faculty is that which constitutes the difference between sensitive and
   insensitive creatures. A stone may have several impressions made upon
   it, as well as the living creature endowed with sense; but with this
   difference, that whatever impressions are made upon a stone, by
   knocking, cutting, or any other kind of motion or action, the stone is
   stupid, and is not in the least conscious of any of those impressions,
   does not perceive what is done to it; whereas those creatures which are
   endowed with sense, do plainly perceive their own and other motions,
   they are affected with the impressions made upon them.

   Now we can give no account of this operation from mere matter. It is
   plain, that matter is not in its own nature sensible; for we find the
   greatest part of the world to consist of insensible parts, and such as
   have no perception. Now if matter be granted in itself to be
   insensible, it is utterly unimaginable, how any motion or configuration
   of the parts of it, should raise that which hath no sense to a faculty
   of perception. Epicurus fancied those particles of matter, of which
   souls were framed, to be the finest and smallest; and for their
   smoother and easier motion, that they were all of a round figure. But
   supposing matter not to be naturally and of itself sensible, who can
   conceive what that is which should awaken the drowsy parts of it to a
   lively sense of the impressions made upon it? it is every whit as easy
   to imagine how an instrument might be framed and tuned so artificially,
   as to hear its own sounds, and to be marvellously delighted with them;
   or that a glass might be polished to that fineness, as to see all those
   objects which are reflected upon it.

   But there is one difficulty in this: for it may be said, if sensitive
   perception be an argument of the soul's immateriality, and consequently
   immortality, then the souls of beasts will be immortal as well as the
   souls of men. For answer to this, I shall say these things:

   (1.) That the most general and common philosophy of the world hath
   always acknowledged some thing in beasts besides their bodies, and that
   the faculty of sense and perception which is in them, is founded in a
   principle of a higher nature than mat ter. And as this was always the
   common philosophy of the world, so we find it to be a supposition of
   Scripture, which frequently attributes souls to beasts as well as to
   men, though of a much inferior nature. And therefore those particular
   philosophers, who have denied any immaterial principle, or a soul to
   beasts, have also denied them to have sense, any more than a clock, or
   watch, or any other engine; and have imagined them to be nothing else
   but a finer and more complicated kind of engines, which, by reason of
   the curiosity and tenderness of their frame, are more easily
   susceptible of all kind of motions and impressions from without, which
   impressions are the cause of all those actions that resemble those
   sensations which we men find in ourselves: which is to say, that birds,
   and beasts, and fishes, are nothing else but a more curious sort of
   puppets, which, by certain secret and hidden weights and springs, do
   move up and down, and counterfeit the actions of life and sense. This,
   I confess, seems to me to be an odd kind of philosophy; and it hath
   this vehement prejudice against it--that if this were true, every man
   would have great cause to question the reality of his own perceptions;
   for to all appearance the sensations of beasts are as real as ours, and
   in many things their senses much more exquisite than ours; and if
   nothing can be a sufficient argument to a man, that he is really
   endowed with sense, besides his own consciousness of it, then every man
   hath reason to doubt whether all men in the world be sides himself be
   not mere engines; for no man hath any other evidence, that another man
   is really endowed with sense, than he hath that brute creatures are so;
   for they appear to us to see, and hear, and feel, and smell, and taste
   things, as truly and as exactly as any man in the world does.

   (2.) Supposing beasts to have an immaterial principle distinct from
   their body, it will not from hence follow, that they are immortal, in
   the sense that we attribute immortality to men. For immortality, when
   we ascribe it to men, signifies two things.

   1. That the soul remains after the body, and is not corrupted and
   dissolved together with it.

   2. That it lives in this separate state, and is sensible of happiness
   or misery.

   1. Immortality imports, that the soul remains after the body, and is
   not corrupted or dissolved together with it. And there is no
   inconvenience in attributing this sort of immortality to the brute
   creatures. And here it is not necessary for us, who know so little of
   the ways and works of God, and of the secrets of nature, to be able to
   give a particular account what becomes of the souls of brute creatures
   after death: whether they return into the soul and spirit of the world,
   if there be any such thing, as some fancy; or whether they pass into
   the bodies of other animals which succeed in their rooms: I say, this
   is not necessary to be particularly determined; it is sufficient to lay
   down this in general as highly probable, that they are such a sort of
   spirits, which, as to their operation and life, do necessarily depend
   upon mat ter, and require union with it; which union being dissolved,
   they lapse into an insensible condition, and a state of inactivity. For
   being endowed only with a sensitive principle, the operations of which
   do plainly depend upon an organical disposition of the body, when the
   body is dissolved all their activity ceaseth; and when this visible
   frame of the world shall be dissolved, and this scene of sensible
   things shall pass away, then it is not improbable that they shall be
   discharged out of being, and return to their first nothing: for though
   in their own nature they would continue longer, yet, having served the
   end of their being, and done their work, it is not unsuitable to the
   same wisdom that made them, and commanded them into being, to let them
   sink into their first state.

   2. Immortality, as applied to the spirits of men, imports, that their
   souls are not only capable of continuing, but living in this separate
   state, so as to be sensible of happiness and misery. For the soul of
   man being of a higher nature, and not only endowed with a faculty of
   sense, but likewise other faculties which have no necessary dependance
   upon, or connexion with, matter; having a sense of God, and of Divine
   and spiritual things, and being capable of happiness in the enjoyment
   of God, or of misery in a separation from him; it is but reason able to
   imagine, that the souls of men shall be admitted to the exercise of
   these faculties, and the enjoyment of that life which they are capable
   of in a separate state. And this is that which constitutes that vast
   and wide difference between the souls of men and beasts: and this
   degree of immortality is as much above the other, as reason and
   religion are above sense.

   3. Another faculty in us, which argues an immaterial, and consequently
   an immortal principle in man, is memory; and this likewise is common in
   some degree to several of the brute creatures, and it seems to be
   nothing else but a kind of continued sensation of things. And of this
   we can give no account from mere matter. For if that which we call the
   soul, were nothing else but, as Epicurus imagined, a little wild-fire,
   a company of small round particles of matter in perpetual motion, it
   being a fluid thing, it would be liable to a continual dissipation of
   its parts, and the new parts that come, would be altogether strangers
   to the impressions made upon the old: so that, supposing the soul
   liable but to those changes which the grosser parts of our bodies, our
   flesh and blood, continually are liable to, by the evaporation and
   spending of the old, and an accession of new matter; (and if we suppose
   the soul to be fluid matter, that is, consisting of particles, which
   are by no kind of connexion linked to one another, it will in all
   probability be more easily dissipable than the grosser parts of the
   body; and) if so, how is it imaginable that these new and foreign
   particles should retain any sense of the impressions made upon those
   which are gone many years ago?

   4. Another faculty which I shall instance in, is the will of man, which
   is endowed with liberty and freedom, and gives a man dominion over his
   own actions. Matter moves by necessary and certain laws, and cannot
   move if it be at rest, unless it be moved by another; and cannot rest,
   that is, cannot but move, if it be impelled by another. Whence then are
   voluntary motions? Whence is the autexsu'sion, the arbitrary principle
   which we find in ourselves, the freedom of action to do or not to do
   this or that, which we are intimately conscious to ourselves of? Of all
   the operations of our minds, it is the hardest to give an account of
   liberty from mere matter. This Epicurus was sensible of, and in
   finitely puzzled with it, as we may see by the question which Lucretius
   puts: Unde est hæc, inquam, fatis avulsa voluntas? "How comes the soul
   of man to have this peculiar privilege of freedom and liberty, above
   all other sorts of matter that are in the world? Whence is it, that
   when all things else move by a fatal necessity, the soul of man should
   be exempted from that slavery?" He does indeed attempt to give an
   account of it from a motion of declination which is proper and peculiar
   to the particles of the soul: but that is a more unintelligible riddle
   than liberty itself. The

   5. Fifth, and last operation I shall instance in, is that of reason and
   understanding. Not to mention the activity and nimbleness of our
   thoughts, in the abstracted notions of our minds, the multitude of
   distinct ideas and notions which dwell together in our souls, none of
   which are accountable from mat ter; I shall only instance in two
   particulars.

   (1.) Those acts of reason and judgment whereby we overrule the reports
   of our senses, and correct the errors and deceptions of them.

   (2.) The contemplation of spiritual and Divine things.

   (1.) Those acts of reason and judgment whereby we overrule the reports
   and determinations of sense. Our sense tells us, that things at a
   distance are less, than our reason tells us they are really in
   themselves; as, that the body of the sun is but about a foot diameter:
   but our reason informs us otherwise. Now what is the principle that
   controls our senses, and corrects the deception of them? If the soul of
   man be mere matter, it can only judge of things according to the
   impressions which are made upon our senses: but we do judge otherwise,
   and see reason to do so many times. Therefore it must be some higher
   principle, which judges of things not by the material impressions which
   they make upon our senses, but by other measures. And therefore, to
   avoid this inconvenience, Epicurus was glad, to fly the absurdity, to
   affirm, that all things really are what they appear to us, and that in
   truth the sun is no bigger than it seems to be.

   (2.) The contemplation of things spiritual and Divine, is an argument
   that the soul is of a higher original than any thing that is material.
   To contemplate the nature of God, and the Divine excellences and
   perfections; the meditation of a future state, and of the happiness of
   another world; those breathings which good men feel in their souls
   after God, and the enjoyment of him--argue the spiritual nature of the
   soul. Hoc habet argumentum divinitatis suæ (saith Seneca) quod eam
   divina delectant, nec ut alienis interest sed suis: "The soul of man
   hath this argument of its Divine original--that it is so strangely
   delighted, so infinitely pleased and satisfied with the contemplation
   of Divine things, and is taken up with these thoughts, as if they were
   its proper business and concernment." Those strong inclinations and
   desires after immortality, and the pleasure which good men find in the
   forethoughts of the happiness which they hope to enter into, when their
   souls shall quit these mansions; the restless aspirings of our souls
   towards God, and those blessed mansions where he dwells, and where the
   spirits of good men converse with him and one another; these signify
   our souls to be of a nobler extraction than the earth, that they are
   descended from above, and that heaven is their country; their thoughts
   are so much upon it, and they are so desirous to return to it.

   I shall conclude this argument, from the noble and excellent operations
   of our souls, of which we are conscious to ourselves, with a passage of
   Tully to this purpose:--Animarum nulla in terris origo inveniri potest:
   nihil enim est in animis mixtum atque concretum, aut quod ex terra
   natum atque fictum esse videatur. "The souls of men have not their
   original from the earth, it is in vain to seek for it there: for there
   is nothing in the mind of man of a material mixture and composition,
   which we can imagine to be born or formed out of the earth. For (says
   he) among material and earthly things there is nothing," Quod vim
   memoriæ, mentis, cogitationis habeat, quod et præterita teneat, et
   futura provideat, et complecti possit præsentia: "There is no earthly
   thing which hath the power of memory, of understanding, of thought,
   which retains things past, foresees and provides for things future,
   comprehends and considers things present." Singularis est igitur quædam
   natura atque vis animi, sejuncta ab his usitatis notisque naturis; "So
   that the nature and power of the soul are of a peculiar and singular
   kind, different from all those natures which we are acquainted with in
   this world." He concludes, Itaque quicquid est quod sentit, quod sapit,
   quod vult, quod viget, cæleste et divinum est, ob eamque rem æternum
   sit necesse est; "Therefore, whatever that is which is endowed with a
   power of perception, with wisdom, with liberty, with so much vigour and
   activity as the soul of man, is of heavenly and Divine original, and
   for that reason is necessarily immortal, and to continue for ever."

   Thus I have represented to you, as briefly and plainly as I could,
   those which I account the chief and strongest arguments of this great
   principle of religion--the soul's immortality. Some of them are plain
   and obvious to every capacity; the rest, though they be above common
   capacities, yet were not to be neglected, because they may be useful to
   some, though not to all; and as those who are more wise and knowing
   should have patience, whilst the most common and plainest things are
   spoken for the instruction of ordinary capacities, so those of lower
   capacities should be content that many things should be spoken which
   may be useful to others, though they be above their reach.

   To sum up then what hath been said from reason, for the proof of the
   soul's immortality. It is a natural dictate and notion of our minds,
   universally entertained in all ages and places of the world, excepting
   some very few persons and sects; it doth not contradict any other
   principle that nature hath planted in us, but doth very well agree with
   those other notions which are most natural; it is most suitable to the
   natural hopes and fears of men; it evidently tends to the happiness and
   perfection of man, and to the good order and government of the world;
   lastly, it gives the fairest account of the phenomena of human nature,
   of those several actions and operations which we are conscious to
   ourselves of.

   Now supposing the soul were immortal, what greater rational evidence
   than this can we expect for it? How can we without a revelation have
   more assurance of the things of this nature than these arguments give
   us, not taken singly, but as they concur together to make up an entire
   argument, and to give us sufficient evidence of this?

   I do not say that these arguments do so necessarily conclude it, that
   there is an absolute impossibility the thing should be otherwise; but
   so as to render it sufficiently certain to a prudent and considerate
   man, and one that is willing to accept of reasonable evidence. For the
   generality of the papists do pertinaciously maintain this unreasonable
   principle--that there can be no certainty of any thing without
   infallibility: yet some of the wiser of them have thought better of it,
   and are pleased to state the business of certainty otherwise;
   particularly Melchior Canus, one of the most learned of their writers,
   determines those things to be sufficiently certain, which no man can
   without imprudence and obstinacy disbelieve:--Certa apud homines ea
   sunt, quæ negari sine pervicacia et stultitia non possunt: "Men esteem
   those things certain, which no man that is not unreasonably obstinate
   and imprudent can deny." And I think the arguments I have brought for
   the soul's immortality, are such, as no man, that is unprejudiced and
   hath a prudent regard to his own interest, can resist.

   Thus I have done with the first thing I propounded to do for the proof
   of the soul's immortality; which was to shew, what evidence of reason
   there is for it. I shall speak briefly to the

   Second thing I propounded, which was to shew how little can be said
   against it, because this will indirectly give a strength and force to
   the arguments I have brought for it. For it is very considerable in any
   question or controversy, what strength there is in the arguments on
   both sides: for, though very plausible arguments may be brought for a
   thing, yet, if others as plausible and specious may be urged against
   it, this leaves the thing in æquilibrio, it sets the balance even, and
   inclines the judgment neither way; nay, if the objections against a
   thing be considerable, though not so strong as the arguments for it,
   the considerableness of the objections does so far weaken the contrary
   arguments: but where the arguments on one hand are strong, and the
   objections on the contrary very slight, and such as may easily be
   answered, the weakness of the objections contributes to the strength of
   the arguments for the other side of the question.

   To come then to the business, I know but three objections which have
   any colour against this principle.

   1. That the notion of a spirit, or an immaterial substance, does imply
   a contradiction.

   Answer 1.--This is only boldly said, and not the least colour of proof
   offered for it by the author that asserts it. This objection had indeed
   been considerable, if it had been made out as clearly as it is
   confidently affirmed. In the mean time, I think we may take leave to
   deny, that the notion of a spirit hath any repugnancy in it, till
   somebody think fit to prove it.

   2. I told you that this question, about the soul's immortality,
   supposeth the existence of God to be already proved; and if there be a
   God, and it be an essential property of the Divine nature, that he is a
   spirit, then there is such a thing as a spirit and immaterial
   substance; and consequently, the notion of a spirit hath no
   contradiction in it: for if it had, there could be no such thing.

   II. It is said, there is no express texts for the soul's immortality in
   the Old Testament.

   Answer.--This doth not properly belong to the intrinsical arguments and
   reason of the thing, but is matter of revelation. And this I shall
   fully speak to, when I come to shew what evidence the Jews had for the
   soul's immortality. In the mean time, this maybe a sufficient answer to
   this objection--that there is no absolute necessity why it should be
   expressly revealed in the Old Testament, if it be, as I have shewn, a
   natural notion of our minds: for the Scripture supposeth us to be men,
   and to have an antecedent notion of those truths which are implanted in
   our nature, and therefore chiefly designs to teach us the way to that
   eternal happiness which we have a natural notion and hope of. The

   III. Third objection is from the near and intimate sympathy which is
   between the soul and the body, which appears in the vigour and strength
   of our faculties; as understanding and memory do very much depend upon
   the temper and disposition of the body, and do usually decay and
   decline with it.

   Answer.--The utmost that this objection signifies, is, that there is an
   intimate union and conjunction between the soul and the body, which is
   the cause of the sympathy which we find to be between them: but it does
   by no means prove, that they are one and the same essence. Now, that
   there is such an intimate union and connexion between the soul and
   matter in all creatures endowed with life and sense, is acknowledged by
   all who affirm the immateriality of souls; though the manner of this
   union be altogether unknown to us: and supposing such an union, it is
   but reasonable to imagine that there should be such a sympathy, that
   the body would be affected with the delights and disturbances of the
   mind, and that the soul should also take part in the pleasures and
   pains of the body, that by this means it may be effectually excited and
   stirred up to provide for the supply of our bodily wants and
   necessities; and from this sympathy, it is easy to give account how it
   comes to pass, that our faculties of understanding, and memory, and
   imagination, are more or less vigorous, according to the good or bad
   temper and disposition of our bodies. For, by the same reason that the
   mind may begrieved and afflicted at the pains and sufferings of the
   body, it may likewise be disordered and weakened in its operations by
   the distempers of the body. So that this objection only proves the soul
   to be united to the body; but not to be the same thing with it.
