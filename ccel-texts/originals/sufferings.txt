PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

   THE prevalent theory of the redeeming sufferings affirms that God is
   impassible, and therefore, limits the sufferings of Christ to his
   manhood alone. This theory has pervaded Christendom, and stood the test
   of centuries; yet have we been forced, by scriptural proofs, to the
   conclusion that it is founded in error, and that the expiatory agonies
   of our Lord reached both his united natures. That our inquiry is of
   importance, no Christian will doubt. We have sought in vain for any
   satisfactory arguments to sustain the prevalent theory. The pulpit, so
   far as our personal experience extends, has been almost silent on the
   theme. We have looked into such theological treatises as have fallen
   within our reach. They abound in reiterations of the averment, "God is
   impassible;" but, with very few and scanty exceptions, they stop short
   at the threshold of that specious, yet unsupported dogma. We have
   betaken ourselves to our Bible. The result of our scriptural
   investigations will appear in these sheets. Perhaps our humble essay
   may elicit from abler minds more ample reasons in favour of this
   ancient and wide-spread theory. If such reasons are drawn fresh and
   pure from the great scriptural reservoir, we shall readily become their
   willing convert. We seek not polemic victory; our sole object is the
   development of TRUTH.

   We shall be obliged often to repeat the sacred names of the Father, the
   Son, and the Holy Ghost; we trust we shall ever do it with becoming
   awe: if, in any instance, we should fail in this paramount duty, our
   contrition will be sincere, as our offence will have been
   unintentional. Nor would we approach our pious and illustrious
   opponents, dead or living, otherwise than with profound respect.
   Opposing what we deem their doctrinal error, it is necessary that we
   should speak with freedom and plainness. The cause of truth seems to
   require that our argument should sacrifice to false delicacy nothing of
   its directness. If, in the ardour of discussion, we should utter or
   intimate anything which may justly be deemed discourteous, it will be
   to us a subject of lasting regret.

   We affix not our name to our unaspiring volume. The omission is not
   from fear of responsibility. Amenable to the judgment of God, we have
   no unbecoming dread of the judgment of men; but, in very truth, we
   believe that our humble name could add nothing to what may possibly be
   thought the force of our reasoning. Our name is unknown to theological
   lore. Of the writer it may justly be said, "Along the cool, sequestered
   vale of life," He "kept the noiseless tenour of" his "way."

   Should any future exigency invite the disclosure of our name, it will
   not be withheld.

   Whatever may be the fate of this imperfect and brief essay, the writer
   will retain one consolatory source of reflection. His feeble effort, in
   every page and in every sentence, will have sought to exalt and magnify
   the glorious ATONEMENT. If he errs, his error will consist in the
   attempt to elevate that most transcendent work of the Godhead to a
   point of awful grandeur, towering even above its scriptural altitude.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

   THE Publishers having determined on the issue of another edition of
   "The Sufferings of Christ by a Layman," the author has availed himself
   of the opportunity to revise the Work with some care. He has made
   additions equivalent in quantity to at least one fourth of the original
   volume; and, without waiving or substantially varying any of the
   positions assumed by his argument, he has softened some forms of
   expression which, upon deliberation, appeared to be more startling than
   the development of truth imperatively required. The author ventures to
   hope that the revision will render the second edition more worthy of
   public acceptance than the first.

CHAPTER I.

   The Trinity---Fall of Man---Plan of Redemption---Christ suffered in
   Divine as well as in Human Nature.

   THAT there is a God above us, "all Nature cries aloud through all her
   works." To this voice of Nature, Revelation adds her imperative voice
   from heaven, proclaiming the existence and government of a wise,
   gracious, and universal Sovereign. The Bible informs us, too, that the
   Deity whom we worship is a triune God. "There are three that bear
   record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these
   three are one." -l John, 5. 7. We quote this passage from the beloved
   disciple with the knowledge that its genuineness has been questioned;
   but, if expunged from the Bible, it would subtract only a single grain,
   from the overflowing measure of scriptural proof that there are three
   persons in the Godhead. The Bible also teaches us that the Trinity
   consists of three distinct persons; united, not commingled, Three in
   One, and One in Three.

   A celebrated Unitarian preacher now deceased, whose simplicity, pathos,
   and eloquence have seldom been surpassed, has laid it down as a
   fundamental objection to the doctrine of the Trinity, that the
   plurality of its persons tends to divide and distract devotional love
   and worship.* But had this distinguished man, with feelings so true to
   nature, forgotten, when he uttered the sentiment just stated, the
   blissful days of youth, when his gladdened eyes beheld, and his
   bounding heart leaped forth to greet, at the domestic altar, two
   distinct, yet united personages, who both claimed and received his
   undivided and undiminished reverence, and gratitude, and love? Was his
   filial piety distracted by the plurality of its objects? Did his heart
   yield a less true and fervent homage to his father, because the angel
   form of his mother was hovering around him, arrayed in the lovely
   habiliments of her own meekness, and gentleness, and grace? Did he find
   it needful, for the full concentration and development of filial
   devotion, that one "of his parents should be forever banished from the
   domestic hearth, leaving the other in cheerless solitude? Did his
   youthful heart yearn for an amendment of the laws of Nature, so that
   each family of earth should have, instead of two, but one solitary,
   lonely progenitor?

   The objection, that the plurality of the persons of the Godhead tends
   to divide and distract devotional love and worship, has as little
   foundation in nature as it has in truth. If St. Paul, when caught up
   into the third heaven, was permitted to gaze, with adoring and melting
   eyes, on the glory and benignity of the Highest, his rapt vision was
   neither divided nor distracted by seeing, on the right-hand seat of the
   celestial throne, that Saviour who had died to redeem him, and, on the
   left-hand seat, that Holy Spirit who had regenerated, sanctified, and
   imbued with the balm of comfort his persecuted and earth-wounded soul.
   The three who "bear record in heaven" are a triple cord of divine
   texture, to bind the believing soul faster, and yet more fast to the
   footstool of its triune God.

   *Channings Works,vol.3. p. 73, 74. Sermon on Ordination of Rev. Jared
   Sparks.

   The social principle is a controlling element of the visible universe.
   In the humblest gradations of nature we see its prevalence and power.
   The fishes in shoals swim the sea; the birds in flocks skim the air;
   the cattle in herds graze on the plains. The subjects of the
   vegetablevegtable kingdom are gregarious. The rose,

   ""Born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air," is
   yet encompassed by sister flowers. Even the weed of the deserted field
   is not alone. When our attention is recalled to man, we shall find the
   social principle an elemental law of his being. Even of him in paradise
   it was said, by unerring lips, "It is not good that man should be
   alone." If we ascend to the next highest grade in the scale of being,
   we may confidently presume that the social principle pervades angelic
   natures. Heaven would cease to be heaven to the angels if each was
   secluded in his solitary cell. The strains of the lonely harp would
   become feeble and plaintive, though stricken by the hand of a seraph.

   May we not, then, without irreverence, venture to presume that the
   social principle reaches even to the Godhead; that he who made man in
   his own image, and after his own likeness, "and breathed into his
   nostrils the breath of life" from the redundant fountain of his own
   ethereal essence, retained in himself, in infinite fulness, that social
   element, with whose infusion he has so copiously imbued the rational
   tenants of this lower world, and whose sprinklings have pervaded every
   part of its animal and vegetable provinces? If we may, indeed, regard
   this as a great truth of heaven, which mortality may contemplate
   without profanation; if

   "Those thoughts that wander through eternity" may sometimes soar, with
   no unholy flight, to the pavilion of the triune Jehovah, what a theme
   of meditation, vast as the universe, unsatiating as the flow of a
   blessed eternity, may piety derive from dwelling on the beatific
   fellowship, with each other, of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
   Ghost! Infinite wisdom holds high converse with infinite wisdom;
   infinite holiness commingles with infinite holiness; infinite love
   takes sweet counsel of infinite love.

   In that temple of the highest heavens, consecrated as the abode of the
   Godhead, each of its divine persons enjoys blissful and untiring
   communion with his two other glorious selves. Into this holiest of
   temples no discrepancy of views, no collision of sentiment ever enters.
   To the most perfect unity of action, thought, and feeling, the infinite
   persons who make it their dwelling -place, are impelled by the
   elemental and immutable laws of their own being. Thus flow on, in high
   and incommunicable blessedness, the successive and cloyless ages of the
   triune God. It must be an iron-hearted theory which would seek to.
   banish from the dwelling -place of the Highest the delights of social
   and equal intercourse, and to consign to lonely solitude the eternity
   of the Sovereign of the universe. The doctrine of the Trinity is,
   doubtless, above the reach of reason; but, when revealed, reason
   perceives and approves its fitness. The infinite Father can find no
   companion among the children of men; they are worms of the dust. Even
   the hierarchies of heaven are but his ministering spirits. He must have
   dwelt in solitary grandeur, but for his holy and rapturous communion
   with his august brethren of the Trinity. What desolation would pervade
   the courts of heaven, reaching even to the sanctuary of Him "that
   sitteth upon the throne," could a ruthless arm of flesh pluck from his
   right hand and his left the beloved fellows of his eternal reign!

   Let it not be alleged that our views lead to Tritheism, or, in other
   words, to the belief in three Gods. Such heresy is equally strange to
   our head and to our heart. We hold sacred the truth that there is but
   one God; we hold equally sacred the sister truth that the one God
   subsists in three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Nor
   can we find any authority in Revelation or reason, which interdicts or
   checks the delightful conception of social communion between the
   illustrious persons of the Trinity.

   On the contrary, the very first chapter in our Bible intimates such
   high and holy communion. "And God said, Let us make man in our image,
   and after our likeness."---Genesis 1. 26. This passage, coeval with
   creation, not only proves the plurality of the persons in the Godhead,
   but also implies their joint resolution, resulting from deliberative
   consultation. And if such consultation between the Sacred Three
   attended the formation of man, how much profounder must have been their
   reciprocated deliberation when his redemption was the absorbing theme!
   What holy transports must have pervaded the pavilion of the Godhead at
   the triumphant return of its second glorious person from terrestrial
   humiliation and suffering, crowned with the laurels of a world
   redeemed!

   Nor are the following passages less indicative of the plurality of the
   persons in the Godhead, and of their social and sacred converse with
   each other. "And the Lord God said, Behold the man has become as one of
   us." Genesis 3. 22. "Go to, let us go down and there confound their
   language." Genesis 11. 7. "And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying,
   whom shall I send, and who will go for us."---Isaiah 6. 8. The plural
   number is thus used, not in anticipated conformity to the style of
   modern royalty, but as suited to shadow forth the co-existence and holy
   fellowship of the Sacred Three in One. The learned and pious Emmons
   affirmed that the plural number is used to express the Deity more than
   one hundred times in Scripture. [1]

   It is not however, our object to demonstrate, by a regular argument,
   the doctrine of the Trinity. Not that we should think its demonstration
   difficult, with the Bible open before us. But those into whose hands
   these sheets will be likely to fill need no confirmation of their faith
   in this fundamental article of our holy religion. We may, then, for the
   purposes of our argument, adopt it as a settled truth, that there are
   three distinct persons in the Godhead: the Father, the Son, and the
   Holy Ghost; and that these three persons are equal in all their
   infinite attributes and perfections; forming by their blessed union the
   only true God. The fall of man was an astounding event in the history
   of the universe. A world, just created in all the freshness and
   loveliness of innocence, and pronounced by its Creator to have been
   "very good," was seduced from its allegiance by the prince of the
   powers of the air. The forgiveness of this apostacy without
   satisfaction would have violated the fundamental laws of the empire of
   the Godhead. The "angels who kept not their first estate," though their
   voices had so long helped to swell the harmony of the heavens; though
   they had been ministering spirits around the throne of the Most High;
   though, ere this world sprang out of chaos, they had shone as morning
   stars; though they had been foremost among the shouting sons of God,
   had yet been cast out, and were confined in everlasting chains of
   darkness. Had rebel man been forgiven without satisfaction, the purity
   of divine justice must have been tarnished forever more.

   But how was rebel man, poor and utterly destitute, to yield
   satisfaction? The title to his new dominion had been cancelled by sin.
   If burnt offerings would have sufficed, "the cattle upon a thousand
   hills" were no longer his. He stood polluted, confounded, seemingly
   abandoned and lost. But pity had entered the heart of One, whose divine
   compassion was infinite as his omnipotence. A voice issued forth from
   the innermost sanctuary of the Godhead: "Deliver him from going down to
   the pit; I have found a ransom."---Job 33. 24. The ransom for
   delinquents, justly doomed to eternal suffering, was to be paid, in the
   suffering of their great Deliverer. The development of this plan of
   grace, so surprising to the heavens, must needs overwhelm with
   astonishment the dwellers upon the earth. It was the mighty movement of
   a God, and all its mysterious and progressive footsteps were to be the
   footsteps of a God.

   Had it been decreed in the council of the Trinity that its second
   person should have suffered in the celestial court, at the very
   footstool of the throne of justice, human reason would have had no
   ground to interpose her speculative cavils. But infinite wisdom deemed
   it most fitting that the great Deliverer should suffer in the vestments
   of that fallen nature which he had so condescendingly and graciously
   undertaken to redeem; and that the new made world, which Satan had
   fondly claimed as a permanent province of his own kingdom, should
   become the scene of the glorious triumphs of the cross. That this great
   atonement was not an illusion, but a solemn reality; that the second
   person of the Trinity, clothed in the habiliments of flesh, suffered in
   very truth for the redemption of our race in his divine as well as in
   his human nature, it will be the object of these pages to establish by
   scriptural proofs.

CHAPTER II.

   Prevalent Hypothesis of God's Impassibility considered---Supported by
   Great Names---Correct when applied to Involuntary Suffering---Incorrect
   when applied to Voluntary Suffering---Argument of Bishop Pearson
   examined.---Sinless Suffering if Voluntary does not imply imperfection
   or infirmity.

   WE are met at the very threshold of our argument with the preliminary
   objection that the divine nature is impassible, or, in other words,
   that God cannot suffer. This objection, if true to its unlimited
   extent, is doubtless insuperable; for if the divine nature of Christ is
   incapable of suffering, he must necessarily have suffered in his human
   nature alone. We must, therefore, pause at once in our argument until
   we have explored the foundations of this startling objection, lest we
   should come, unwittingly, into collision with the awful attributes of
   Jehovah. The hypothesis that God is impassible is stated broadly by its
   advocates without restriction, qualification, or exception. It applies,
   therefore, as well to voluntary as to involuntary suffering by any one
   of the persons of the glorious Trinity.

   If a dogma pertaining to the viewless attributes of the unsearchable
   Godhead can rest for its support on mere human authority, then the
   hypothesis in question is, indeed, to be regarded as impregnable. It
   has stretched itself over Christendom, and stood the ordeal of
   centuries. The Roman Catholic church has adopted it as one of her
   settled axioms; the venerable church of England has lent it the names
   of her Hooker, her Tillotson, her Pearson, her Barrow, her Beveridge,
   her Horne, and her Horsley; the Protestant church of France has
   sanctioned it by the adhesion of her eloquent Saurin; the Baptist
   church has added the name of her no less eloquent Hall; and the
   Presbyterian church has crowned it with the accumulated authority of
   her Owen, her Charnock, her Edwards, her Witherspoon, her Dwight, her
   Mason, and her Emmons. To these high intellectual dignitaries a
   lengthened and still lengthening list might be added from the dead and
   the living.

   Against names so distinguished for talents, learning, and piety, it is
   with unaffected diffidence that we venture to raise the voice of our
   feeble dissent. We should scarcely have entered on the arduous
   undertaking, but from our firm conviction that these illustrious
   personages have endorsed the hypothesis without that profound attention
   and discrimination which has usually marked the movements of their
   mighty minds. None of them has, to our knowledge, fortified it by a
   single quotation from the Oracles of Truth, or devoted to it a single
   page of argument, with the solitary exception of Bishop Pearson. The
   brief remarks of that learned prelate will be noticed hereafter.

   The other distinguished fathers, whose revered names we have recorded,
   have generally dismissed the hypothesis with a mere passing sentence.
   "God is impassible," or some other expression, of almost equal brevity,
   is the only notice they have bestowed on a proposition high as heaven,
   and vast as infinity. So far as we may judge from their writings, they
   received the hypothesis as a consecrated relic of antiquity, without
   pausing to inquire whether its materials were celestial or earthy. It
   passed from their hands, bearing no marks of ever having been tested -
   by the touchstone of the Bible.

   To the prevalent hypothesis, so far as it relates to involuntary or
   coerced suffering by the Being of beings to whom it is applied, we make
   no objection. It would be both irrational and irreverent to
   imagineimgine that the Omnipotent could be forced to suffer against his
   own volition. No hostile darts can pierce the thick "bosses of his
   bucklers."---Job 15. 26. Once, in the history of the universe, has the
   futile experiment been made. The malcontents of heaven, a mighty host,
   aspired to shake the throne of the Highest. Their catastrophe has
   engraved on the walls of the celestial city and on the vaults of hell a
   lesson lasting as eternity. God's impassibility to coerced suffering is
   a plain and palpable principle of natural religion, resulting
   inevitably from his attributes of infinite knowledge, infinite wisdom,
   and infinite power.

   But as we enter the sphere of voluntary suffering, the question assumes
   a new and very different aspect. We are, indeed, still met at the
   threshold with the ever-present hypothesis, "God is impassible." But
   upon what authority do its adherents apply their standing axiom to the
   suffering of one of the persons of the Trinity, emanating from his own
   free volition and sovereign choice? They hold the affirmative of their
   hypothesis. The rules of evidence, matured and sanctioned by the wisdom
   of ages, devolve on them the burden of proof. To the living alone can
   we appeal; and from them we solemnly invoke the proof of an hypothesis
   gratuitously advanced, and which commingles itself with the vital
   elements of Christian faith. We affectionately point them to the Bible
   as the only true foundation of a theory seeking to limit the
   omnipotence of the Godhead. The Bible gives them no favourable
   response. From Genesis to Revelation, both inclusive, there is not, to
   our knowledge or belief a passage which intimates, directly or
   indirectly that persons of the Trinity has not physical and moral
   ability to suffer, if his suffering is prompted by infinite love and
   infinite wisdom.

   Do the advocates of the hypothesis of the divine impassibility appeal
   to the Areopagus of human reason, that proud tribunal, to which even
   the heathen gods were said to have referred their controversies? We
   respectfully, yet confidently, meet them there. From none of the
   physical attributes of the Deity can human reason legitimately draw her
   bold inference, that one of the persons of the Trinity, to whom "all
   things are possible," may not, in the plenitude of his omnipotence,
   become the recipient of voluntary suffering. God indeed is a Spirit;
   but that a spirit can suffer is fearfully demonstrated in the history
   of the universe.

   Is the inability of a person of the Trinity to suffer, when, in his
   benignant, and wise, and infinite discretion he elects to become a
   Sufferer, to be deduced from any of the moral attributes of the Deity?
   It is indeed a blessed truth, that God will not transcend any of the
   holy elements which constitute his august being. It is revealed to us
   that he cannot violate the awful sanctity of his truth. That he can do
   no other wrong, is justly to be inferred from his own Sacred Oracles.
   His causeless suffering might, therefore, exceed perhaps even the
   limits of his omnipotence. He is ever moved by that benevolence, which
   forms a ruling element of his nature, to elevate, to the highest
   practicable point, the general happiness of the universe. Of that
   universe he is himself the soul; the infinite, to which all creation is
   but the finite. His needless suffering, then, would unspeakably
   subtractsubstract from the totality of universal bliss, and might thus
   transcend the immutable limits of his moral being.

   But if one of the persons of the Trinity elects voluntarily to suffer
   for some adequate cause; some cause deeply affecting the happiness of
   the universe; some cause intimately connected with the glory of those
   who sit upon the throne; some cause sanctioned in the conclave of the
   Highest; some cause worthy to move a God: dare human reason interpose
   her puny veto against the mighty resolution? Would reasoning pride
   scale the highest heavens, and, standing at the entrance of the divine
   pavilion, proclaim, in the hearing of astonished cherubim and seraphim,
   that Omnipotence lacks physical or moral ability to become the willing
   recipient of suffering, prompted by its own ineffable love, and
   sanctioned by its own unerring wisdom?

   God is not mere Intellect. He has a heart as well as understanding; he
   has volitions, desires, sympathies, emotions. "God is love." To sinful
   passions his bosom is, indeed, inaccessible; but it overflows to
   infinitude with all those holy sensibilities which he breathed into
   innocent man with the breath of life. How can reason contemplate such a
   Being, and yet, without scriptural authority, deny to him the capacity
   of suffering, even from his own free and almighty choice? Perhaps it
   might be laid down as a self-evident truism, that the capacity to
   suffer necessarily results from the capacity to enjoy. The ability of a
   person of the Trinity to become the voluntary recipient of short-lived
   suffering may, for aught that speculative pride can urge to the
   contrary, have been, in the history of eternity, an element not less
   conducive than his omnipotence, to the prosperity of the universe and
   the glory of the Godhead.

   On the abstract question of the capacity of the divine nature to suffer
   of its own free volition, we would not, for ourselves, have ventured
   gratuitously to speculate. Upon a theme so lofty and so holy, we should
   have chosen to preserve a profound and reverent silence. But when we
   find it, as we suppose, recorded in the Sacred Oracles, that the second
   person of the Godhead actually suffered for the redemption of our
   fallen race; when our credence to that august truth is interdicted by
   the hypothesis, "God is impassible," with a voice of power heard, and
   echoed, and reverberated along the track of ages; when that hypothesis,
   to retain its own claim to infallibility, must change into figures of
   speech some of the plainest declarations of Holy Writ, it becomes the
   right and the duty even of a private Christian to explore respectfully,
   yet fearlessly, the foundations of a dogma deeply fortified, it is
   true, in human authority, and hallowed by the lapse of hoary-headed
   Time, yet scarcely claiming to repose itself on the basis of
   Revelation.

   That the Son of God should have suffered in his divine nature for the
   redemption of man is not more startling to human reason than the
   stupendous fact of his incarnation. If, at the time of the first
   manifestation of divinity in the flesh, the angel of the Lord, instead
   of announcing the event to the humble shepherds of Bethlehem, had
   appeared in the midst of an assemblage of Athenian philosophers, made
   up from the schools of Zeno, Aristotle, and Epicurus, proclaiming to
   them the "good tidings of great joy," and benignly expounding the
   spirituality, the ethereal nature, and all the infinite attributes of
   him who had formed the worlds and was now cradled in a manger, the
   incarnation of such a being for the remission of mortal sins must have
   seemed "unto the Greeks foolishness." The heavenly envoy would have
   been held "to be a setter forth of strange gods."---Acts, 17. 18.
   Philosophic incredulity would have treated as a fable of mythology the
   mysterious message of grace. Peripatetic subtilty might boldly have
   sought to scan the spiritual anatomy of the revealed God, and dared to
   pronounce its vain decree, that the holy enigma of his incarnation was
   a physical or moral impossibility. Yet, if there is demonstration on
   earth, or truth in heaven, the Son of God, the second person of the
   glorious Trinity, did, in very fact, become incarnate for the
   redemption of man.

   We have promised to notice the brief argument of Bishop Pearson on the
   divine impassibility. That we may be sure to do him justice, we give
   the substantial parts of his remarks in his own words. He says:

   "The divine nature is of infinite and eternal happiness, never to be
   disturbed by the least degree of infelicity, and therefore subject to
   no sense of misery. Wherefore, while we profess that the Son of God did
   suffer for us, we must so far explain our assertion as to deny that the
   divine nature of our Saviour suffered; for, seeing the divine nature of
   the Son is common to the Father and the Spirit, if that had been the
   subject of his passion, then must the Father and the Spirit have
   suffered. Wherefore, as we ascribe the passion to the Son alone, so
   must we attribute it to that nature which is his alone, that is, the
   human. And then neither the Father nor the Spirit appears to suffer,
   because neither the Father nor the Spirit, but the Son alone, is man,
   and so capable of suffering. Whereas, then, the humanity of Christ
   consisted of a soul and body, these were the proper subject of his
   passion; nor could he suffer anything but in both, or either of these
   two."

   "Far be it, therefore, from us to think that the Deity, which is
   immutable, could suffer; which only hath immortality, could die. The
   conjunction with humanity could put no imperfection upon the divinity,
   nor can that infinite nature, by any external acquisitionacqisition, be
   any way changed in its intrinsical and essential perfections. If the
   bright rays of the sun are thought to insinuate into the most noisome
   bodies without any pollution of themselves, how can that spiritual
   essence contract the least infirmity by any union with humanity? We
   must neither harbour so low an estimation of the divine nature as to
   conceive it capable of any diminution, nor so mean esteem of the
   essence of the Word as to imagine it subject to the sufferings of the
   flesh he took, nor yet so groundless an estimation of the great mystery
   of the incarnation as to make the properties of one nature mix in
   confusion with another." [2]

   It will be perceived that Bishop Pearson's first ground of argument is,
   that the divine nature of the Son of God being common to the Father and
   the Holy Spirit, if the Son suffered in his divine nature, then the
   Father and the Spirit must have suffered. It is an inflexible rule in
   the science of logic than if an argument proves too much, it proves
   nothing. Its proving too much is an infallible sign that it is
   intrinsically and radically erroneous. The whole argument is condemned.
   Now the fatal disease of the argument under consideration is, that it
   proves too much. It touches even the holy incarnation itself. Test the
   argument, by applying it to the incarnation instead of the suffering of
   the Son. The argument, thus applied, would stand thus: The divine
   nature of the Son is common to the Father and the Spirit. If,
   therefore, the divine nature of the Son had become incarnate, then must
   the Father and Spirit have become incarnate also. But we learn from the
   Bible that neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit became incarnate. The
   argument, if it proves anything, would, therefore, prove that the
   incarnation of the blessed Son was but a fiction. Thus the corner-stone
   of our faith would be removed from its place. Samson pulled down the
   temple of the Philistines. The learned and pious prelate would
   unwittingly demolish, if his lever was indeed the resistless lever of
   truth, that holy temple "not made with hands," whose glorious walls are
   founded on the incarnation of the Son of God, and cemented by his most
   precious blood.

   Peterson on the Creed, p. 311, 312, and 313.

   The second ground of argument adopted by Bishop Pearson is, that the
   imputation of possibility to the divine nature would imply its
   "imperfection" and "infirmity." This would indeed be true, if it sought
   to expose the divine nature to involuntary or coerced suffering. But
   the supposition that one of the persons of the Trinity can suffer
   voluntarily, and for an adequate cause, argues no "imperfection" or
   "infirmity" in the divine nature; on the contrary, it relieves the
   divine nature from the "imperfection" and "infirmity" which the
   hypothesis of our opponents would cast upon it. Their hypothesis says
   that neither of the persons of the Trinity can in any case suffer. He
   cannot suffer even from his own spontaneous choice and free volition.
   He cannot suffer, however strongly infinite wisdom and infinite love
   might urge his suffering. If the universe was threatened with ruin, he
   could not suffer to save it, for his suffering would be interdicted by
   the fixed and unbending laws of his being. And would not such an
   incapacity to suffer imply "imperfection" and "infirmity" in the divine
   nature? It is our opponents, then, and not we, who would attach to the
   divine nature this "imperfection" and "infirmity." It is they, and not
   we, who would thus hamper Omnipotence by fetters made in the forges of
   earth.

   The supposition that the imputation of voluntary possibility to the
   divine nature would imply its "perfection" and "infirmity" rests not on
   the eternal granite of the Bible. If its living advocates claim for it
   a foundation there, let them point to the sustaining verse or chapter.
   If they rely for its sole support on human argument, we would remind
   them, in all respect and kindness, that reason in its speculations on
   the unrevealed attributes of the Godhead, but

   "Leads to bewilder, and dazzles to blind."

   It is true that suffering, when predicated of fallen man, implies
   "imperfection" and "infirmity;" because in him it is the progeny of
   transgression, personal or ancestral. Man suffers because man has
   sinned. Sin is a compound of imperfections and infirmities; and the
   character of the parent descends to the unhappy offspring. Hence has
   originated the supposition, so deeply and widely rooted, that suffering
   implies "imperfection" and "infirmity."

   But no such implication can attach to the vicarious suffering of a
   sinless being. Should Gabriel become the recipient of voluntary pangs
   for some object of benevolent and high import, approved and commended
   by the Sacred Three, would reason, in all her arrogance, presume to
   draw, and record as an axiom in her faith, the bold conclusion that the
   magnanimous endurance implied "imperfection" and, "infirmity" in the
   angelic nature? Would not the devoted act of celestial piety afford a
   new development of the holiness and elevation of heaven's ministering
   spirits, and exalt to a higher point our affectionate admiration of him
   who, perhaps more immediately than his fellows, stands "in the presence
   of God?" That innocence pure as that of the angels has capacity to
   suffer, is demonstrated by the sinless wailings heard from Gethsemane
   and from Calvary.

CHAPTER III.

   Hypothesis of God's Impassibility continued--Not a Self-evident
   Proposition--Incarnation itself implies Suffering--Prevalent Hypothesis
   Traced to its Source in early Antiquity--Argument of Athanasius
   examined.

   THE hypothesis of God's impassibility to voluntary sufferings is not a
   self-evident proposition. It carries not demonstration on its face; it
   proves not itself; it requires extraneous confirmation. Whence is such
   confirmation to be derived? It is yielded neither by the Bible nor by
   the deliberative process of sound reasoning. The prevalent hypothesis,
   then, rests on opinion alone. But unsupported opinion, though emanating
   from the wisest and the best, is incompetent, however long continued or
   widely diffused, to sustain a dogma claiming the place of a
   corner-stone in the structure of Christian faith. The opinion of one
   man, or of millions, of one age, or of successive ages, is not the test
   of theological truth. Christianity should be the last to recognise such
   test. She repudiated it by her own example. Her first achievement on
   earth was her unsparing invasion of the empire of ancient and almost
   unanimous opinion. Should she admit that the force of opinion can
   impart to religious belief the stamp of truth, she must, to be
   consistent, spare the deep-seated, and wide-spread, and
   time-consecrated superstitions of Africa and of India. An insulated
   opinion on theological tenets, without support, is but a cipher. Such
   unsupported opinion, however multiplied, cannot form a unit.

   The incarnation itself is a death-blow to the hypothesis of God's
   impassibility. If the Godhead is of necessity impassible, one of its
   august persons could not have become incarnate. The mighty Being who,
   in the fifth verse of the seventeenth chapter of John, uttered the
   prayer, "And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the
   glory which I had with thee before the world was," could have been none
   other than the second person of the Trinity, clothed, indeed, in flesh.
   The prayer itself demonstrates that the Supplicant was not of earth,
   that he had come down from heaven, that he had existed there, and
   enjoyed the intimate fellowship of the Father before the world was
   created. It contains intrinsic evidence that, at the time of the
   prayer, the divine Supplicant was sustaining the temporary privation of
   his glorious fellowship with the infinite Father, and that he longed to
   have it restored. His prayer breathed forth his deep consciousness of
   the severity of the bereavement. It evinced a bereavement which had
   marred for a time his infinite beatitude. His eclipsed beatitude was
   not, for the moment, like the ineffable beatitude which he had enjoyed
   before incarnation. This very bereavement is but another name for
   suffering.

   There is a passage in the epistles german to that upon which we have
   been commenting: "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery
   to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon
   him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and
   being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient
   unto death, even the death of the cross."---Philippians, 2. 6, 7, 8.
   The words in this passage translated "made himself of no reputation,"
   should, in justice, have been rendered, "emptied himself." That is
   their literal meaning. By the substitution of their own language, the
   translators may have gained something in elegance; they have lost much
   in strength. Our argument prefers the plain Doric of Paul to the more
   fastidious style of his translators.

   The illustrious personage who had "emptied himself" was he "who, being
   in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God." He
   was, beyond peradventure, the second person of the Trinity. Of what had
   he "emptied himself?" He had "emptied himself" of the "form of God" for
   the "form of a servant." He had "emptied himself" of his celestial
   mansion to become a houseless wanderer upon the earth. He had "emptied
   himself" of the ministration of angels to wash the feet of his
   betraying and deserting disciples. He had "emptied himself" of the
   glory which he had with the Father before the world was created. He had
   "emptied himself" of his beatific communion with his august companions
   of the Trinity. And has privation no suffering? Say, ye exiled princes,
   is there no suffering in privation? Say, ye fallen families, whose
   fortunes have taken to themselves wings and flown away, is there no
   suffering in privation? Declare, ye lately bereaved widows, ye newly
   smitten parents, from the depths of your breaking hearts declare, is
   there no suffering in privation? The very incarnation, then, should
   have strangled in its cradle the earthborn hypothesis, "God is
   impassible."

   We have taken some little pains to trace the prevalent hypothesis to
   its source in early antiquity. Not that we bow to the authority of the
   judicatory of tradition, verbal or written. We recognise but one Caesar
   in this terrestrial province of the great empire of spiritual truth.
   That imperial, sovereign, infallible arbiter is the Bible. To this most
   august of potentates we reserve the privilege of appealing. It is an
   unalienable privilege; it is the sacred birthright of the Christian,
   guarantied to him by the last will of the "Alpha and Omega," who was
   dead and is alive again.

   The prevalent hypothesis we have traced to the fourth century. Some
   brief intimations of the divine impassibility are, no doubt, to be
   found sparsely scattered in the writings of the earlier fathers. There
   are also in the earlier fathers some intimations to the contrary. The
   fourth century, if it was not the creator of the hypothesis, was at
   least the first that formally incorporated it into Christian theology.
   The correctness of this position seems to be demonstrated by the letter
   written about the middle of the fourth century by Liberius, the pope of
   Rome, to Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, asking his opinion on the
   impassibility of God, and submitting himself to the paramount authority
   of such opinion. The letter and the reply of Athanasius are contained
   in an early page of the writings of that distinguished bishop. If the
   Roman Pontiff had found plenary evidence of the hypothesis in the Word
   of God, he would scarcely have appealed, for its authority, to the word
   of man. Had he deemed the hypothesis an established article of
   Christian theology, he would not have sought to strengthen the sacred
   and firm-seated column by the frail prop of a private opinion. If he
   clearly perceived that God had incorporated it into his own Holy
   Oracles, the head of the Catholic church would not have submitted
   himself, in so essential an article of faith, to the judgment of
   Athanasius.

   He of the fourth century, who gave "a local habitation and a name" to
   the prevalent hypothesis, was this same Bishop of Alexandria That
   Athanasius was a great man, the intelligent reader has not to learn
   from these humble sheets. Though then young, he was the master spirit
   of the Nicene Council. He is the man whose name was borrowed to clothe
   with immortality that summary of faith afterward compiled, and baptized
   by the appellation of "the Athanasian Creed." His spiritual domination
   has almost equalled, in its extent and permanence, the intellectual
   empire of the illustrious Stagyrite. It was he of whom the great Hooker
   exclaimed, "The world against Athanasius, and Athanasius against the
   world!" This distinguished theologian wrote a regular and elaborate
   argument in favour of the hypothesis of God's impassibility and the
   kindred theory of the exclusive humanity of Christ's sufferings.

   We have searched out this argument with profound interest and
   high-raised expectations. It may justly be regarded as the official
   proclamation of the fourth century in support of the prevalent
   hypothesis and its lineally -descended theory. It was written by him
   who is generally held to have been the great champion of primeval
   orthodoxy. The general father of Western Christendom had specially
   invoked his attention to the important subject. We may fairly presume
   that his argument was induced by the promptings of the papal letter.
   The world in every age may therefore confidently regard his exposition
   as having concentrated within its ample limits all that Christian
   antiquity could gather in favour of his doctrine from the freshly
   inspired Oracles, or glean from the writings of its uninspired, yet
   learned patriarchs. Of this elaborated argument we have appended a
   translation from the original Greek. We must beseech the kind reader to
   pause here, and, turning to, the Appendix, listen to this oracular
   voice of the olden time before he resumes the thread of our unaspiring
   essay. [3]

   Supposing that the reader has complied with the closing request of the
   last paragraph, he will now be prepared to proceed with us in a brief
   review of the Athanasian argument, embodying, as it does more on our
   subject than can probably be found elsewhere in the whole compass of
   sacred literature, ancient and modern, if gleaned and compacted
   together. The first ingredient that we justly look for in a theological
   argument is scriptural authority. The argument of Athanasius scarcely
   claims such authority for its support; on the contrary, he seemingly
   wishes to have removed out of his way a mass of scriptural verbality,
   to afford an appropriate site for the erection of his reasoning
   edifice. He objects to a literal construction of Scripture; from thence
   we infer his deep conviction that the language of Holy Writ, if taken
   according to its plain import, must needs have excluded him from access
   to his building site. With more point than courtesy, he significantly
   intimates that the literal readers of the Bible are like, "brutes;" nor
   does he allow them the rank even of "clean beasts" that "ruminate,"
   because they chew not the meditative cud of subtle philosophy. The very
   corner-stone of the Athanasian the rank even of "clean beasts" that
   "ruminate," because they chew not the meditative cud of subtle
   philosophy. The very corner-stone of the Athanasian hypothesis is thus
   founded on bold aberration from the ostensible signification of
   scriptural language.

   This assumed right of man to amend the declarations of the Holy Ghost,
   Athanasius had been taught by at least one of his venerated
   predecessors. The celebrated Origen, in the tenth book of his Stromata,
   dared to utter the following startling sentiments which, if uttered by
   us, would be held impious; he says, "the source of many evils lies in
   adhering to the carnal or external part of Scripture. Those who do so
   shall not attain to the kingdom of God. Let us, therefore, seek after
   the spirit and the substantial fruits of the Word, which are hidden and
   mysterious." And again he says, "The Scriptures are of little use to
   those who understand them as they are written."

   These sentiments of Origen seem to have been adopted by Athanasius.
   They are fully developed in his renowned argument. They form the basis
   of that bold hypothesis which by its confident pretensions and its
   author's brilliant name, seems, for near fifteen centuries, to have
   dazzled the mental vision of the wisest and the best. Nothing can be
   more dangerous to the vital elements of Christian faith than this
   latitudinarian construction of the Holy Oracles. It commingles with the
   inspiration of heaven a controlling infusion of the philosophy of
   earth. It substitutes for the Word of the infallible God the fallible
   word of frail and presumptuous man. This latitudinarian interpretation
   of the Bible was the great moral disease of the first five centuries of
   the Christian era. It converted what should have been its "high and
   palmy state" into one vast receptacle of schisms and heresies. We would
   not do injustice to the primitive ages of the Church; their
   persecutions and martyrdoms, so patiently and so nobly borne, are
   deeply engraven on our memory; the roll of impartial history unfolds,
   also, the imperishable record of their wild phantasies, their bitter
   intestine divisions, their frequent shipwrecks of the faith -the
   legitimate offspring of their reckless constructions of the Oracles of
   Truth.

   Athanasius says that the Bible is to be construed with special
   reference to what human reason deems "fitting to God." We hence.
   conclude that the supposed unfitness of suffering to the dignity of the
   Godhead is the prime element of the Athanasian hypothesis. The
   syllogism of Athanasius, then, stands thus: It is not "fitting to God"
   to suffer. The God incarnate did suffer: therefore the incarnate God
   suffered not in his divine nature. The correctness of the syllogism
   turns on the truth of its major proposition, viz., the supposed
   unfitness of the divine nature for suffering. But that was a point for
   the decision of the conclave of the Trinity. In that august tribunal it
   must have been decided before the holy incarnation. We purpose to show,
   by scriptural proofs, that it was there decided adversely to the
   decision of the author of the prevalent hypothesis. From his
   philosophical syllogism to the Inspired Volume we bring our writ of
   review. We appeal from Athanasius to God.

   In the course of our future argument, we shall accumulate scriptural
   passages denoting that, besides the privations incident to his
   incarnation, the second person of the Trinity did, in very truth,
   suffer in his ethereal essence infinitely, or, at least, unimaginably,
   for the salvation of the world. To insert those passages here would be
   reversing the order of our argument. When they come to be introduced,
   if understood by others as we understand them, we must beg the kind
   reader to transplant them, in thought, to this identical place. When
   they shall have been thus transplanted, they will carry home to that
   time-consecrated, yet fallacious hypothesis, "God is impassible," the
   work of demolition more surely and demonstratively than could volumes
   of argument drawn from the storehouse of reason. Will not plenary proof
   from Scripture, that the divine nature of Christ actually participated
   in his mediatorial sufferings, convince even reasoning skepticism that
   his divinity had physical and moral capacity to suffer?

   The dogma of divine impassibility precludes the supposition that the
   redeeming God suffered even by sympathy. Impassibility excludes
   suffering in all its forms, whether caused by sympathy or direct
   personal infliction. Sympathy may induce pangs intense as any corporeal
   agonies. The anguish of the suffering child is often surpassed by that
   of the sympathizing mother. The redeeming God was united to the
   redeeming man by ties closer than ever bound a mother to the child of
   her affections. But if the prevalent hypothesis be true, how could the
   throes and spasms of the suffering man have moved any emotion of
   sympathy in the heart of the impassive God? How could he have pitied
   the sufferer "like as a father pitieth his children?"--Psalms 103. 13.
   Impassibility would be just as inaccessible to the pangs of sympathy as
   to any other modification of pain.

CHAPTER IV.

   Prevalent Theory of Christ's Sufferings limits them to his
   Humanity--Necessary Result of Hypothesis of Divine
   Impassibility--Theory of the same Antiquity and Prevalence as
   Hypothesis--Object of our Argument stated--Remarks of Dr.
   Chalmers--Remarks of Dr. Harris--Remarks of Professor Vinet--Who and
   what Christ was--His Synonymes--Definite Article should have been
   prefixed to Name by Translators--Scriptural Passages declarative of
   Sufferings of Christ.

   HAVING, in the preceding chapters, considered the preliminary objection
   arising from the alleged impassibility of the divine nature, we may
   now, it is hoped, pursue our inquiry, whether Christ suffered in his
   united natures, or in his manhood alone, without danger of impugning
   any of attributes the Godhead. The capacity of his divinity to suffer
   is not, of itself, proof that it actually suffered; nor can the
   question of its actual sufferance be decided by any mere reasoning
   process; it lies beyond the ken of our mental vision; the decision of
   the question rests on scriptural proofs.

   The prevalent theory of Christ's"s sufferings limits them to his human
   nature. This theory was the sure result of the prevalent hypothesis,
   that God is impassible. If the divine nature was held incapable of
   suffering, then the conclusion must have been inevitable that his
   sufferings were confined to his manhood. The prevalent theory, like its
   parent was born in early antiquity. It has followed the footsteps of
   its progenitor, as the shadow pursues its substance, along the track of
   near fifteen hundred years. Like its parent, it has stretched its shade
   over continents and pervaded Christendom.

   Since the maturity of the prevalent hypothesis, and its kindred theory,
   in the fourth century, their adherents have generally aspired to
   sustain them by naked opinions alone, multiplied, indeed, to an almost
   incalculable extent. With the single exception of Bishop Pearson, we
   have met with no modern author who has attempted to support them by
   anything that could claim the name of an argument. His brief remarks
   have already been partially considered. They will come again under
   review in, the course of these pages. Whether the argument of
   Athanasius has self-supporting, competency to uphold a spiritual world,
   as the Oriental tortoise was supposed to sustain the material, our
   readers, by turning to the Appendix, may judge for themselves.

   Whether the redeeming God, as well as the redeeming man, suffered for
   the salvation of the world, is a question which the adherents of the
   prevalent hypothesis and theory have never, to our knowledge, examined
   and fairly discussed on its scriptural merits, as a distinct point of
   theological inquiry. Holding the hypothesis of the divine impassibility
   as a self-evident truism, they have subfected to its control all
   scriptural passages bearing on the passion of our Lord. Such inspired
   passages as come into seeming collision with the hy-pothesis they
   regard as Eastern imagery. They understand them as mere metaphors and
   figures of speech. They deem the discussion of them superfluous, if not
   profane. They hold that, as the divine impassibility has become an
   elemental doctrine of the Christian Church, all debate upon the weight
   of scriptural proofs that the divinity of Christ bore its share in his
   expiatory agonies is forever precluded. They debar debate by a deep and
   mandatory call for the previous question. They will probably consider
   the invocation of scriptural authorities at this late day as a too bold
   impeachment of the irreversible decree of hoary haired Time.

   That Christ suffered in both his natures we believe to be a revealed
   truth of our holy religion. Nor is it the least interesting department
   of inspired lore. It opens a celestial paradise, rich in more choice
   and lasting fruits than bloomed in the terrestrial Eden. "Search the
   Scriptures" is the passport of God to its tree of knowledge. Yet has an
   earth-formed apparition, clothed in the as-sumed vesture of an angel of
   truth, seemed to stand for centuries at its entrance, and, with its
   phantom sword, to interdict all ingress.

   We design, by the blessing of God, to present the question relative to
   the nature and divinity of the mediatorial sufferings as a solemn issue
   to be tried, on scriptural evidence, before the inquisition of the
   Christian world. We assume the affirmative; we take upon ourselves the
   burden of showing that the divinity of Christ participated in his
   sufferings. Among the witnesses to be examined will be Isaiah, and
   Zechariah, and Matthew, and Mark, and Luke, and the disciple who leaned
   on the bosom of Jesus, and Stephen, and Paul, and Peter. The awful
   proclamations of the Holy Ghost will be invoked. An appeal will be made
   to the affecting declarations of the incarnate, suffering, dying, risen
   God. We demand an impartial trial.

   We shall address ourselves especially to plain enlightened common
   sense, well read in Holy Writ, unbiassed by deep-rooted theories,
   unfettered by the overbearing predominance of human dogmas, content to
   sit as a little child, and learn the attributes and demonstrations of
   the Godhead from the Oracles of revealed wisdom. The question to be
   tried is less one of doctrine than of fact. The evidence will be simple
   and practical, little needing the aid of learned exposition. It will be
   brought fresh from the gospel mint; it will carry the stamp of no human
   hypothesis; it will not bear the im-age and superscription of an
   earth-born Caesar; its pure gold will need no purification in the
   crucible of science. For the result of the verdict we feel no anxiety
   peculiar to ourselves. We seek truth rather than polemic victory.

   If the question between our opponents and ourselves was to be tested by
   the mere reasonableness of our respective positions, we should
   confidently expect a decision adverse to the prevalent theory. Divine
   justice could not pardon mortal sin without aqequate satisfaction. Nor
   could it receive satisfaction in any coin save that of suffering.
   Without adequate suffering not a soul could be saved. The second person
   of the Trinity voluntarily became the vicarious Sufferer for the
   redeemed. The substitution was not to depress the awful standard of
   retributive justice. The Glory of the Godhead was to be maintained;
   heaven must be satisfied, hell silenced. The substituted coin was to
   bear the scrutiny of eternity. The redeeming God lacked not capacity to
   suffer. Did he in Godlike grandeur, most condescendingly and graciously
   suffer in his own ethereal essence? or did he, himself untouched by
   pain, form a redeeming man, destined from his birth to bear, in his
   frail human nature, the expiatory anguish required at the exchequer of
   heaven as the price of a world's"s salvation? To borrow the terms
   wrought into the major proposition of the Athanasian syllogism, was it
   most "fitting to God" that the redeeming Son should save our fallen
   race by suffering in his own divine essence, or that he should devolve
   the whole burden of the vicarious suffering on his created proxy? Was
   the coin formed of divine, or that composed of human suffering, most
   acceptable at the celestial treasury, in satisfaction of the lofty
   requisitions of outraged and inflexible justice?

   But we will not farther pursue this train of thought. It might conduct
   to irreverent speculation. It would seem that even human reason, unless
   blinded by the hypothesis of divine impassibility, must herself
   conclude, from, her own unbiassed reflections, that, in urging the
   prevalent theory, she is in danger of advocating a dogma derogatory to
   the disinterestedness and dignity of the Godhead. The question at issue
   is not however, to be decided by the mere umpirage of reason. It
   depends upon scriptural testimony. Reason can do nothing more than
   collect, and arrange, and present, and weigh the inspired proofs to be
   found in the Word of God.

   We have expressed our belief that our opponents have left the questions
   of divine impassibility and the exclusive humanity of the mediatorial
   sufferings substantially where the Athanasian argument left them. We
   may have been mistaken. Chapters, and even volumes on the subject may
   possibly have appeared in some of the languages of earth, dead or
   living, and yet escaped our circumscribed knowledge. But if we are
   mistaken, the error, though it must doubtless impeach our theological
   scholarship, will derogate nothing from the strength of our scriptural
   argument. The increase of books is almost infinite, multiplying
   libraries to an extent which casts into the shade the Saracen
   devastation at Alexandria. With all the "multitudinous" volumes of
   theological lore, the countless progeny of the unceasing travail of
   eighteen centuries, there is but one created being that can claim
   universal familiarity. That being is the worm. It alone, of finite
   things, has bibliothecal ubiquity. The hugest tomes appal it not. To
   fastidiousness of taste it is a stranger. It feeds not on the ambrosia
   of genius alone. Its never -satiated appetite loathes not even the
   offals of polemical dulness. To rivalship with the worm, in compass of
   research, we dare not aspire.

   Our argument seeks not shelter under the wing of human authority; yet
   it is satisfactory to find that some few of the best and the wisest
   have thought as we think. It will readily be perceived that the remarks
   we are about to quote, and which first reached our knowledge after
   these sheets were prepared for the press, stand seemingly opposed to
   the hypothesis of God's"s impassibility, and to the theory that
   Christ's"s sufferings were confined to his manhood.

   The first quotation is from the illustrious Chalmers. He says:

   "It is with great satisfaction that I now clear my way to a topic the
   most salutary, and, I will add, the most sacramental within the whole
   compass of revealed faith; even to the love wherewith God so loved the
   world as to send his Son into it to be the propitiation for our sins. I
   fear, my brethren, that there is a certain metaphysical notion of the
   Godheand which blunts our feelings of obligation for all the kindness
   of his good-will for all the tenderness of his mercies. There is an
   academic theology, which would divest him of all sensibility; which
   would make of him a Being devoid of all emotion and all tenderness;
   which concedes to him power, and wisdom, and a sort of cold and clear,
   and faultless morality, but which would denude him of all those fond
   and fatherly regards that so endear an earthly parent to the children
   who have sprung from him. It is thus that God hath been presented to
   the eye of our imagination as a sort of cheerless and abstract
   Divinity, who has no sympathy with his creatures, and who, therefore,
   can have no responding sympathy to him back again. I fear that such
   representations as these have done mischief in Christianity; that they
   have had a congealing property in them towards that affection which is
   represented the most important, and, indeed, the chief attribute of a
   religious character, even love to God; and that just because of the
   unloveliness which they throw over the aspect of our Father who is in
   heaven, whereby men are led to conceive of him as they would of some
   physical yet tremendous energy, that sitteth aloft in a kind of
   ungainly and unsocial remoteness from all the felt and familiar
   humanities of our species. And so it is, we apprehend, that the theism
   of nature and of science has taken unwarrantable freedoms with the
   theism of the Bible; attaching a mere figurative sense to all that is
   spoken there of the various affections of the Deity, and thus
   despoiling all the exhibitions which it makes of him to our world of
   the warmth and power to move and to engage, that properly belong to
   them. It represents God as altogether impassive; as made up of little
   more than of understanding and of power; as having no part in that
   system of emotions which occupies so wide a space in the constitution
   of man, made after his own image and according to his own likeness."

   "The Father sent his Son, for our sake, to the humiliation and the
   agony of a painful sacrifice, There is evident stress laid in the Bible
   on Jesus Christ being his only Son, and his only beloved Son. This is
   conceived to enhance the surrender; to aggravate, as it were, the cost
   of having given up unto the death so near and so dear a relative. In
   that memorable verse where it is represented that God so loved the
   world as to send his only begotten Son into it, I bid you mark well the
   emphasis that lies in the so. There was a difference, in respect of
   painful surrender, between his giving up another, more distantly, as it
   were, connected with him, and his giving up one who stood to him in
   such close and affecting relationship. The kin that he hath to Christ
   is the measure of the love that he manifested to the world, in giving
   up Christ as the propitiation for the world's"s sins. What is this to
   say but that, in this great and solemn mystery, the Parent was put to
   the trial of his firmness? that, in the act of doing so, there was a
   soreness, and a suffering, and a struggle in the bosom of the Divinity?
   that a something was felt like that which an earthly father feels when
   he devotes the best and the dearest of his family to some high object
   of patriotism? God, in sparing him not, but in giving him up unto the
   death for us all, sustained a conflict between pity for his child and
   love for that world for whom he bowed down his head unto the sacrifice.
   In pouring out the vials of his wrath on the head of his only beloved
   Son, in awaking the sword of offended justice against his fellow; in
   laying upon him the whole burden of that propitiation, by which the law
   could be magnified and its transgressors could be saved; in holding
   forth on the cross of Christ this blended demonstration of his love and
   his holiness, and thus enduring the spectacle of his tears and of his
   agonies and cries till the full atonement was rendered; and not till it
   was finished did the meek and gentle sufferer give up the ghost. At
   that time, when angels, looking down from the high battlements of
   heaven, would have flown to rescue the Son of God from the hands of
   persecutors, think you that God himself was the only unconcerned and
   unfeeling spectator? or that, in consenting to these cruel sufferings
   of his Son for the world, he did not make his love to that world its
   strongest and most substantial testimony."*

   The next quotation is from the pen of the distinguished Harris, now a
   living personification of talent, learning, eloquence, and piety in the
   independent Church of England. He says:

   "And how does it enhance our conceptions of the divine compassion when
   we reflect that there is a sense in which the sufferings of Christ were
   the sufferings of the Father also! From eternity their divine
   subsistence in the unity of the Godhead had been only short of
   identity; nor could the circumstance of the Saviour's"s humiliation in
   the slightest degree relax the bonds of this mutual in-being. While
   walking the earth in the form of a servant, he could still affirm, My
   Father is in me and I in him"--- "I and my Father are one."

   "The love of God, then, invites our adoration not only as it at first
   sent his only begotten Son; during every moment of the Saviour's"s
   sojourn on earth that love was repeating its gift, was making an
   infinite sacrifice for sinners; while every pang he endured in the
   prosecution of his work was the infliction of a wound in the very heart
   of paternal love. Who, then, shall venture to speak of the appeal which
   was made to that love, of the trial to which that love was put when the
   blessed Jesus took into his hand the cup of suffering, when his
   capacity for suffering was the only limitation his sufferings knew? If
   it be true that God is always in vital sympathetic communication with
   every part of the suffering creation; that as the sensorium of the
   universe, he apprehends every emotion, and commiserates every thrill of
   anguish, how exquisitely must he have felt the filial appeal, when in
   the extremity of pain; in the very crisis of his agonizing task, the
   Saviour cried, "My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?"

   "What a new and amazing insight, then, does it give us into his love
   for sinners, that it was able to bear the stress of that crisis, that
   it did not yield and give way to the incalculable power of that appeal!
   This is a circumstance which, if I may say so, puts into our hands a
   line, enabling us to fathom his love to an infinite depth; but we find
   it immeasurably deeper still. It invests the attractions of the cross
   with augmented power; for in the sufferingssuffeiings of that scene we
   behold more---if more we are capable of seeing---more even than the
   love of Christ. In every pang which is there endured we behold the
   throes of paternal love, the pulsations and tears of infinite
   compassion; more than the creation in travail, the divine Creator
   himself travailing in the greatness of infinite love.:"*

   The last quotation is from the celebrated Professor Vinet, justly
   styled "the Chalmers of Switzerland." He says:

   "Either the human heart is incapable, from its nature, of feeling love,
   or that man will feel it, who, enveloped in ignorance as a garment, has
   seen the God of glory descending even to him, to seek him in the depths
   of his disgrace; who, from the gloom and sorrow in which his conscience
   kept him plunged, has seen himself transported into a region of light
   and happiness; who, in respect to himself, has seen verified that
   amazing language of the prophet, "In all their afflictions he was
   afflicted;"---who has seen, --- mystery, miracle!---his God travelling
   by his side, in the rugged path of life; nay, voluntarily assuming the
   burden which was crushing him; a God humbled, a God weeping, a God
   anguished, a God dying! That long contest, if I may dare to say it,
   that agony of God for generations, that painful birth by which humanity
   was brought forth to the life of heaven, has been re-vealed to him in
   the ancient dispensation; he has been shown the very steps of God
   impressed upon the dust of ages, and mingled with the foot-prints of
   the human race; but at the trace which that God has left on the rock of
   Calvary, the rock of his heart is broken, the veil of his understanding
   torn away."*

   The Christ of the Bible was that "Holy. Thing," born of the virgin, and
   conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost. He who begat him imparted to
   the infant Saviour the distinctive appellation of the Christ. The
   elements composing this unique and august Being were the human nature
   of his virgin mother, corporeal and intellectual, and the ethereal
   essence of the second person of the Trinity. His divine and human
   natures remained distinct, notwithstanding their union. They were
   united, not commingled. The name, the Christ, was not an unmeaning
   appellative; it was at once comprehensive and descriptive; pointing
   significantly to its absorbing centre, the mysterious and awful union
   of his manhood and his Godhead. To this illustrious personage other
   names are given in the New Testament. He is there called not only
   Christ, but also Jesus, Christ Jesus, Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, the
   Son of God, the Word, and the Lamb of God. All these appellatives are
   identical in their meaning with the name, the Christ, when applied to
   Him whose birth invoked the song of the descending angels.

   Note.--In referring to the translation of this distinguished author by
   the Rev. Robert Turnbull, of the American Baptist Church, we cannot but
   express our admiration, not only of the original work, but also of the
   fidelity and elegance of the translation. We know of the few foreign
   productions, ancient or modern, that have been rendered into our
   language with more faithfulness, spirit, and eloquence.

   Our translators should always. have prefixed to the name of Christ the
   definite article. It belonged there. He was not only Messiah, but the
   Messiah; not only anointed, but the Anointed; not merely Christ, but
   the Christ. To the name of the Voice that cried in the wilderness they
   have almost invariably prefixed the article. In nearly every instance
   they have rendered the name, not John Baptist, but John the Baptist.
   This is as it should have been. The article gives to the name its
   proper significance and force. The prefixion of the definite article
   should no more have been omitted in the case of Christ than in that of
   his precursor. The translators have saved a short word. It was not true
   economy. They lost in meaning more than they gained in brevity.

   From the numerous scriptural passages declarative of the sufferings of
   Christ, we have selected the following: "Before I" (Christ)
   "suffer."---Luke, 22. 15. "Ought not Christ to have suffered?" Luke,
   24. 26. "Thus it behooved Christ to suffer." ---Luke, 24. 46. God
   before showed , "that Christ should suffer." ---Acts, 3. 18. "Opening
   and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered." ---Acts, 17. 3.
   "That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should
   rise from the dead."---Acts, 26. 23. "If so be that we suffer with him"
   (Christ).---Romans, 8. 17. "For even Christ our passover is "sacrificed
   for us."---l Corinthians, 5. 7. "For as the sufferings of Christ abound
   in us."---2 Corinthians, 1i. 5. " For he hath made him to be sin for
   us, who knew no sin."---2 Corinthians, 5. 21. "And the life which I now
   live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me,
   and gave himself for me."---Galatians, 2. 20. "Christ hath redeemed us
   from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us."---Galatians, 3.
   13. "As Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an
   offering and a sacrifice to God."---Ephesians, 5. 2. "Even as Christ
   also loved the Church, and gave himself for it."---Ephesians, 5. 25.
   "That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the
   fellowship of his sufferings.---Philippians, 3. 10. "To make the
   Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."---Hebrews, 2.
   10. "For in that he himself" (Christ) "hath suffered, being
   tempted."---Hebrews, 2. 18. "Though he were a Son, yet learned he
   obedience by the things which he suffered."---Hebrews, 5. 8. "For then
   must he" (Christ) "often have suffered since the foundation of the
   world."---Hebrews, 9. 26. "Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify
   the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate."---Hebrews,

CHAPTER V.

   Name of Christ---Its Compass and Power---Scriptural Language, how to be
   construed---Name includes both his Natures---Any Exceptions are created
   and explained by the Bible---No such Exception intimated in Case of his
   Sufferings---Christ's"s own Declarations, Luke, 24, 26, 46---His Name
   denotes Totality of his united Being, not one of its parts---Union of
   his two Natures constituted holy Partnership, to which his Name was
   given---Name not applicable to the exclusive Suffering of the human
   Partner.

   THE, abounding scriptural declarations of the sufferings of Christ,
   just presented to the reader, are general and unqualified, without
   limit or exception. They cover all the consecrated ground covered by
   the name of the Christ. The reader has already learned that the name,
   the Christ, was imparted by the Holy Ghost to the infant Jesus, to
   designate his mysterious union of humanity with the Godhead. The name
   was commensurate with the infinitude of his united being. The limits
   and power of that redeeming, yet awful name, will be the theme of the
   present chapter. We shall attempt to show that, when applied by
   Scripture to the mediatorial sacrifice, the name itself, in its
   distinctive and wide---reaching signification, necessarily imports, ex
   vi ter--mini, or from its own intrinsic compass and potency, the
   participation of both Christ's"s natures in his expiatory sufferings.

   It must constantly be borne in mind, that what distinguished Christ
   from all other beings in the universe, was his union of the divine and
   human natures. Earth teems with men, and the celestial throne sustains
   two other persons of the Godhead; but the unique phenomenon of a being,
   at once God and man, was first exhibited in the manger of Bethlehem,
   where it received, from the, Holy Ghost, its distinctive appellation.
   It cannot be denied that the name, the Christ, and each of its
   equivalents, ordinarily includes both his natures. It must be admitted
   that, as a general rule, the term can only be satisfied by its
   application to his two natures unitedly; that the two natures are its
   natural aliment; that the name is crippled by confining it to his
   humanity alone; that his two natures are the divine and human pedestals
   on which this glorious name reposes in all the infinitude of its
   meaning.

   The science of construing words, written and spoken, has been matured
   by the united wisdom of centuries. It is the use of words which
   elevates man above the brute, and on their just and uniform
   construction depend the stability and safety of all the transactions of
   social life. Of this useful science, the most simple, universal, and
   controlling axiom is its elemental rule, that words are to be construed
   according to their plain, obvious, and ordinary import. No
   meta-physical subtilties are to make fluctuating the standard of
   speech. On this rule depends the security of deeds, the most important
   documents known in the private intercourse of living men; on this rule
   rests the sanctity of those hallowed bequests which come to us as
   voices from the dead; even legislative enactments lose all their value,
   and become dangerous snares when the inviolability of this cardinal
   rule is wanonly invaded.

   This elemental axiom is, as it were, the human palladium of the Oracles
   of Revealed Truth. That document, written by the hand of God to
   enlighten the common mind, should be ever meekly received by the
   children of men, according to the plain, obvious, and ordinary meaning
   of its sacred words. Its language is brief, simple, clear; well suited,
   if left unobscured by construction, to the level of ordinary
   understandings. Its phraseology was selected by the Holy Ghost, as best
   calculated to bring home even to the closets of uneducated piety the
   precepts and consolations of inspired wisdom in all their purity and
   force. It is the call of their heavenly Father to the lost and
   wandering sons and daughters of humanity. It has all the tenderness,
   and simplicity, and plainness of the parental voice. Unless clouded by
   human interpretation, it well knows how to wind its way into the inmost
   recesses of the filial heart.

   The words of Scripture should be understood by us in the same manner as
   they were calculated to be understood by those to whom they were
   originally addressed. We are to receive them according to their
   apparent signification, not to hunt after some occult meaning. If they
   startle us by their loftiness of import, we must remember that they are
   the words of the unsearchable God. If they are "as high as heaven," we
   have no right to drag them rudely down to earth. To pursue the imagined
   spirit of a passage, in opposition to its plain letter, is an
   experiment that man should make with fear and trembling. He may,
   unwittingly, "add unto," or "take away from" that holy book which came
   down from above. Let him beware of the penalties denounced at the close
   of the last chapter of the New Testament -Revelation, 22. 18, 19.

   If the scriptural passages declarative of the sufferings of Christ are
   taken in their plain, obvious, and ordinary sense, they include, beyond
   peradventure, his divine nature as well as his humanity. The name of
   Christ is used by the inspired writers to indicate the recipient of the
   mediatorial sufferings; and that name, in its ordinary import, has no
   limits narrower than the whole compass of his united natures. Let a man
   of ordinary understanding, candid and intelligent, untinged by the
   unfounded hypothesis of God's"s impassibility, open his Bible; let him
   read there the oft-repeated, general, and unqualified declarations that
   Christ suffered; let him call to mind the peculiarity of Christ's"s
   being, uniting in himself the God and the man, and that this union, in
   all the elements of both its natures, is pervaded and represented by
   his distinctive appellation, and the inference seems to be inevitable,
   that he would come to the conclusion that the sufferings of Christ were
   as extensive as the import of his holy name. It doubtless would not
   occur to this plain and unbiassed reader of the Bible that he was at
   liberty to narrow down, by his own fiat, to a particular and contracted
   meaning, declarations and words which the Holy Ghost left general and
   unlimited.

   It is true that a few insulated cases are to be found in Scripture,
   where words expressive of Christ are applied peculiarly to his human
   nature. It is on this ground, as it would seem, that the advocates of
   the prevalent theory, seek to bring under the same category the general
   and, abounding scriptural declarations of his sufferings. We might
   reply that, in these few insulated cases, the distinctive name of
   Christ is almost never used; but we prefer to place our reply on more
   general grounds. We have, at some pains, ascertained the number of
   times that the name of Christ, in some of its forms, appears in the New
   Testament, and find it to be sixteen hundred and twenty-five. The
   insulated cases in which either of his names, or its equivalent, is
   used to designate his human nature exclusively, cannot exceed one or
   two in a hundred of this number.

   These insulated cases are so rare in their occurrence, and so uncertain
   in their import, as scarcely to amount to an exception to the general
   scriptural rule, that the name of Christ denotes both of his united
   natures. And in all these insulated cases the limitation of his name to
   his human nature is rendered inevitable by intrinsic marks on the
   passages themselves, or by contiguous portions of Holy Writ. Take, as a
   sample, the following passage: "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature,"
   Luke 2. 52. Inspiration limits this passage to his humanity, by
   assuring us that as God he was perfect in wisdom ere the worlds were
   formed, and, that as an infinite Spirit he was without corporeal
   stature. Take, as another sample, the declaration of Christ, "My Father
   is greater than I.,"---John 14. 28. The declaration was restricted to
   his manhood by our Lord himself, when he said, a few chapters before,
   "I and my Father are one." Take yet another sample, "But of that day
   and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven,
   neither the Son, but the Father."---Mark 12. 32. This lack of
   prescience is necessarily confined to the human nature of the Son by
   numerous other passages of the New Testament, which imply that, as the
   second person of the Trinity, his omniscient eye scans at a glance the
   illimitable expanse of the future. So, that in these insulated cases,
   it is God, and not man, who limits to the humanity of Christ a name
   including both his natures within its expressive import. The Bible
   itself explains the excepted passages; the Bible still stands its own
   expositor; it is not, human reason that engrafts the particular
   limitation on the general language of Holy Writ.

   So, in a very few cases, scriptural terms expressive of Christ have
   exclusive reference to his Godhead. Take the following as an example,
   "Before Abraham was I am."---John 8. 58. Sacred history states that the
   man Christ Jesus was then only about thirty years old. The Bible
   itself, therefore, necessarily limits the declaration of ex-istence
   before the birth of Abraham to the in-dwelling God. But where the Bible
   interposes no restrictive qualification, the name, the Christ, and its
   equivalents, whenever occurring in Sacred Writ, stand forth in all the
   amplitude of meaning originally imparted to them by the Holy Ghost.
   They are never to be restricted within narrower limits merely because
   reason deems such restriction most "fitting to God."

   The name, the Christ, when mingled in the ever-recurring declarations
   of his sufferings, is not limited. to his humanity, directly or by
   implication, anywhere in the Word of God. The limitation sought to be
   engrafted on the declarations of his sufferings rests on human, not on
   divine authority. It is the begotten of the unfounded hypothesis, "God
   is impassible." Had that hypothesis never been adopted, it is not
   likely that the prevalent theory, confining the sufferings of Christ to
   his human nature, would have found a place in Christian theology.

   It is the radical error of the prevalent theory, that it seeks to
   contract, without scriptural authority, to the manhood of Mary's"s son
   the declarations of the Holy Ghost applicable, in their terms, to the
   whole incarnate God, and crippled by a more limited application. Human
   reason has no authority delegated from above to restrict, by its own
   volition, what the Bible has left general. The Word of God must not be
   bent to what human reason somewhat arrogantly terms, when applied to
   divine things, its own sound discretion. The sound discretion of one
   theorist differs from the sound discretion of another theorist. If the
   Bible is to shape itself to the ever-varying phases of what claims to
   be the sound discretion of reason, it must assume more forms than the
   fabled Proteus of heathen mythology ever assumed. The self styled sound
   discretion of human reason has done the Bible more harm than it ever
   suffered from the prince of darkness. It has brought Christians into
   collision with Christians; it has broken into fragments what should
   have been the one and indivisible Church of the Son of God; it has rent
   asunder what the Roman soldiery spared, even the seamless vestment of
   Christ.

   The impropriety of limiting to his mere humanity the unlimited
   declarations of Scripture indicattive of Christ's"s sufferings will be
   more obvious if we consider the relative proportions which his two
   natures bore to each other. The one was finite, the other was infinite;
   the one akin to the dust of the earth, the other thinking it "not
   robbery to be equal with God." Would the inspired writers, would our
   Lord himself, then, if intending to have it believed that the divinity
   of Christ had not suffered, have used, to express the sufferings of his
   mere terrestrial adjunct, terms applicable to the whole infinitude of
   his united natures; and terms, too, which are crippled and distorted by
   a more limited application? They best knew the natures and agonies of
   the Mediator: and when they used the significant term, the Christ, to
   designate the recipient of the expiatory sufferings, they must have
   meant that the Christ, the whole Christ of the Bible had suffered.

   When you speak of the visible heavens, in terms broad and unlimited,
   you cannot be supposed to have lost sight of the blue expanse and the
   glorious sun above you; and your words, appropriate and suited to the
   whole majestic scene, and to that only, should not be narrowed, by mere
   construction, to the frail cloud that specks the skirt of the horizon.
   If these inspired writers, if our Saviour himself had intended to
   declare that the atoning sufferings of Christ were confined to his mere
   earthly appendage; if they had designed to limit the generality of
   their words to so restricted and confined a meaning, they would have
   said so in terms, or, at least, by necessary implication. There is no
   self-contracting power in the words indicative of suffering to draw
   within creature dimensions a name framed by the, Holy Ghost to include
   within its vast compass not only the finite man, but the infinite God.

   When our Lord, after his resurrection, asserted his sufferings
   interrogatively, "Ought not Christ to have suffered?" when, in a
   subsequent verse of the same chapter, he repeated the assertion
   positively, "Thus it behooved Christ to suffer;" when he thus, without
   restriction, used the very name which he had himself adopted to
   designate his, united natures, can erring man venture to say that by
   that name he intended to designate one of his natures only as the
   recipient of his suffering, and that, too, the inferior one?---Luke,
   24. 26, 46. The Son of God did not say, interrogatively or positively,
   that Christ ought to have suffered, or that it behooved him to suffer
   in his human nature only. It is reasoning pride which seeks virtually
   to interpolate into the sacred texts the omitted words, "i"in his human
   nature only," by its own uninspired interpretation.

   How can worms of the dust presume to limit, by such words off addition
   and restriction, the unlimited and unrestricted declarations of the
   infinite Son; lowering, too, the majesty of the declarations, as it
   were, from heaven down to earth? We are bound to give unqualified
   credence to what Christ unqualifiedly uttered. It would ill become us
   to suppose that he spoke unadvisedly. He best knew that while in a
   subordinate sense he was man, he was God in the primary and, principal
   elements of his being. He perfectly understood that the name of that
   God-man, of his own glorious self, was Christ. When he used his own
   distinctive name, without restriction or limitation, his meaning must
   have had all the compass which that name imports. When he twice
   declared in the same chapter that Christ had suffered, without
   restriction or limitation, he must be understood to have included both
   the natures indicated by the name of Christ, and to have affirmed that
   the whole Christ had suffered.

   The distinctive name, the Christ, was the name of the totality of his,
   person. It was not given to either of his two natures, but to their
   union; it was the name of the whole, not of its parts. It is ordinarily
   no more used in Scripture to signify one of his united natures than the
   name circle is used in mathematics to signify one of the segments of
   which it is composed. Whenever the term Christ is used in Scripture,
   save in a very few insulated cases, scarcely amounting to an exception,
   it was intended to be applied to both his natures unitedly. When,
   therefore, the Bible so often declared that Christ suffered, it meant
   to declare that he suffered in his united natures. Suffering in his
   human nature would have been the suffering of the human son of the
   Virgin; suffering in the divine nature would have been the suffering of
   the second person of the Trinity; but in neither case would the
   suffering have been the suffering of Christ.

   God formed the first Adam "of the dust of the ground, and breathed into
   his nostrils the breath of life." The creature thus formed was
   compounded of body and soul. To this complex being, and to his
   posterity, the appellation of man was given by his almighty Creator.
   The name pertains not exclusively to his soul or to his body, but to
   their mysterious union. It would be an unintelligible abuse of the name
   to apply it separately either to his corporeal or to his spiritual
   nature. It belongs to the united totality of the man.

   To the second Adam, combining in himself divinity and humanity, the
   distinctive appellation of Christ was imparted by the Holy Ghost, to
   designate, not one of his united natures singly, but their glorious
   union. The name of Christ was as exclusively appropriatedap-propriated
   to his united being. as the name of man was appropriated to the united
   body and soul of the first Adam. The name of Christ, when used without
   explanation, can no more be limited to his human nature than the name
   of man, when used without explanation, can be limited to the human
   body. The few insulated cases where the name of Christ is applied, in
   Scripture, to his manhood alone, have in or about them abundant
   scriptural explanations. Where the Bible has recorded no limiting
   explanation, we are bound to suppose that it intended to affix to the
   sacred name the same plenitude of meaning affixed to it by the Holy
   Ghost when it was originally imparted to the infant Saviour. The
   abounding scriptural declarations of the sufferings of Christ are
   limited to his manhood by no scriptural explanations. They stand,
   therefore clothed in the same amplitude of signification that was
   attached to the consecrated name by the Holy Ghost in the manger of
   Bethlehem.

   The Bible is wont to express heavenly things by earthly similitudes.
   Sustained by this example, we would venture most reverentially, to
   suggest that, by the incarnation, the second person of the Trinity
   received into a holy partnership with himself the human son of Mary.
   The union had for its object the salvation of a world. To that sacred
   union a distinctive name was given. The name of the holy partnership
   was the Christ. It commenced in the womb of the Virgin; its duration
   was to be without end; its members were once wrapped together in the
   swaddling clothes of the manger; they now occupy the right hand throne
   of heaven. Both retained, in unmingled perfection, their own distinct
   natures; they differed infinitely in dignity; the one was a worm of the
   dust; the other was the Lord of Glory.

   According to the prevalent theory the man, in his own distinct nature,
   suffered, while the God remained wholly free from suffering. Now we
   submit it as a clear proposition, that, under this theory, the
   individual and insulated sufferings of the terrestrial partner were not
   the sufferings of the holy union; that they were not distinguishable by
   its partnership appellation; and that they could not, without violating
   the elemental principles of speech, have been called the sufferings of
   Christ. Under the prevalent theory, the holy union suffered not. Its
   name, then, would not have been employed by Inspiration to designate
   the suffering. Its sacred name was con-secrated to the holy union. If
   the name has, in a very few insulated cases, been depressed to the man,
   it was the Bible that did it; and the Bible was not only the author,
   but the ample expositor of the depression. The Bible contains no
   intimation, direct or indirect, of any such depression of the name of
   Christ, when applied to his sufferings. There was none. His sufferings
   were the sufferings of the holy union in both its natures.

   A partnership of earth, whether commercial, professional, agricultural,
   or literary, cannot be said to suffer from an injury to one of the
   individual partners, in his separate and distinct capacity, in no wise
   affecting the association. The partnership can only be said to suffer
   when the injury is felt by all its partners directly, and not merely by
   sympathy. To apply the partnership name to an injury borne by an
   individual partner exclusively would be a palpable misuse of the term.
   So, if in the holy union designated by the name of Christ, the man had
   been the sole sufferer, his individual suffering would not have been
   expressed by the name dedicated to the holy union. Such an
   appropriation would have been a misapplication of the sacred name of
   which the inspired writers were utterly incapable.

CHAPTER VI.

   Phrase, the Person of Christ---Means nothing more than simple Name, the
   Christ---No Analogy between Person of Christ suffering from Pains of
   Human Nature and Person of ordinary Man suffering from corporeal
   Pains---Bishop Pearson again considered---Bishop Beveridge.
   considered---Divinity of Christ suffered actually, not merely by
   construction---If Christ suffered only in Humanity, his Sufferings,
   taken in reference to Divine Beatitude were inconceivably small.

   THE phrase, the person of Christ, holds a conspicuous place in
   Christian theology, and is intimately connected with our subject. The
   union of his two natures constitutes what is termed the person of
   Christ; and it is supposed by our opponents that, from the suffering of
   either of his united natures, his person would be said to suffer. Hence
   it is argued that the scriptural declarations affirming that Christ
   suffered, in general and unrestricted terms, had abundant aliment in
   the suffering of his manhood alone. This is a citadel, claiming
   impregnable strength, in which the advocates of the prevalent theory
   have entrenched themselves; it requires, therefore to be accurately
   examined.

   It is believed that the phrase, the person of Christ, is found but once
   in the translation of the New Testament, 2 Corinthians, 2. 10. The
   verse in the translation reads thus: "To whom ye forgive anything, I
   forgive also; for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your
   sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ." The best commentators
   think that this passage is incorrectly translated, and that the
   original Greek words rendered "in the person of Christ" should have
   been rendered "in the name and by the authority of Christ." So thought
   Macknight, and other commentators agree with him.

   But it would be useless to pursue the inquiry whether the phrase, the
   person of Christ, is of divine or human origin. Whatever its origin may
   be, the phrase has no greater amplitude of meaning than the simple
   scriptural name, the Christ. The name expresses the union of the divine
   and human natures; the phrase expresses nothing more. Christ and the
   person of Christ are synonymous. Should theology seek to clothe the
   phrase with a wider meaning than belongs to the simple name, the
   extension must be wrought out by the artificial process of human
   reasoning. On such extension no true theory of Christian faith can
   repose. None can object to the use of the phrase as a convenient
   synonyme for the name of Christ; we may ourselves use it for that
   purpose in these sheets; beyond that its use is not sanctioned by
   scriptural authority. The name itself imports the union of the Godhead
   and the manhood; the phrase can legitimately import nothing more.

   It has been urged, that as the union of his two natures forms the
   person of Christ in the same way as the union of the soul, and body of
   an ordinary man forms the person of that man, so the numerous passages
   of Scripture declarative of Christ's"s sufferings are all satisfied by
   his having suffered in his humanity, in the same manner as an ordinary
   person is said to suffer, though his pains are corporeal. It is not
   within our province to complain of the comparison between the person of
   Christ, composed of his two natures, and the person of an ordinary man,
   composed of his body and soul, when used for purposes of general
   illustration; but when applied to Christ's"s expiatory agonies, and
   urged to satisfy, by the suffering of his mere manhood, the
   oft-repeated declarations of Scripture, averring his sufferings in
   terms which, according to their natural and plain import, would make
   them pervade every recess of his united being, nothing can be more
   fallacious and misleading than this very comparison.

   The person of an ordinary man is said to suffer from corporeal pains,
   because corporeal pains affect his whole united being. If any one
   doubts whether an ailment of the body communicates itself to the mind,
   let the skeptic attempt some intellectual effort with a raging
   toothache, or with a limb writhing under the agonies of the gout. So,
   mental suffering, when intense or protracted, affects the body. The
   disease of a broken heart, though it may find no place on the bills of
   mortality, has, nevertheless, many victims.

   But if there was no sympathetic link between the human soul and her
   humble sister; if she stood impregnable in her impassibility; if she
   was cased in armour of proof less penetrable than the fabled armour of
   the Grecian hero; if she felt the ailments of her encircling flesh no
   more than the body feels the rents of the garments which it wears,
   then, indeed, the local pains of the outer man could not be ranked
   under the denomination of the suffering of his person. The chief
   element of his person is the immortal, priceless spirit within. Should
   that continue to bask in the sunshine of bliss, untouched by the local
   ailments of his mere body, those ailments would be classed under some
   more limited and humble appellation than that of the suffering of his
   person. A part of a person is not the person. This position is based on
   the elemental principle that a part is not the whole. The foot is not
   the person, though forming one of its integral parts. Any ailment of
   the foot, unless it generally affected the person, could not be
   denominated the suffering of the person.

   If we are at liberty to suppose that, by the laws of his united being,
   the agonies of Christ's"s human nature pervaded and affected his divine
   essence also, then, and then only, would any similitude exist between
   the person of Christ suffering from his human anguish, and the persona
   of an ordinary man suffering from corporeal pain. But the very
   corner-stone of the prevalent theory rests on the supposition that. the
   anguish of Christ's"s human nature did not affect the divine; that
   while the man Christ Jesus was writhing under agonies unparalleled in
   the annals of profane or sacred story, the God Christ Jesus was
   untouched by pain; that his beatitude was as perfect at Gethsemane, and
   on the cross, as it had been when, in his presence, "the morning stars
   sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy," to celebrate
   the birth of the new world which he had just brought into being. Job,
   38. 7.

   If the divinity of Christ, cased in everlasting impassibility,
   participated not in the agonies of his manhood, then the supposed
   analogy between the person of an ordinary man suffering from his
   corporeal pains, and the person of Christ suffering from the pains of
   his human nature, utterly fails. The manhood of Christ was but an
   insulated atom in the infinitude of his being. The local and
   incommunicable pains of that insulated atom would have been termed the
   sufferings of the person of Christ, no more than the rippling of some
   small and sequestered bay would be denominated the commotion of the
   mighty ocean to which it is joined. The Godhead of Christ was the
   infinite constituent of his person. While his divinity retained in full
   perfection its primeval and ineffable beatitude, suffering would not
   have been predicated of the person of Christ. The insulated pangs of
   his manhood would rather have been denominated the sufferings of his
   terrestrial adjunct, than the sufferings of the august person of the
   incarnate Deity. Upon the prevalent theory, the little rivulet of human
   wo, bitter indeed, and dark, as it could not have ruffled or
   discoloured, so it would not have given its melancholy name to the
   peaceful, illimitable, and heavenly sea of divine felicity which formed
   the predominating, the almost absorbing element of the person of the
   God, "manifest in the flesh."

   The suffering of a person implies the suffering of the whole person,
   whatever may be the locality of the pain. Personality is indivisible;
   and every thing affirmed of it, unless there are very special words of
   limitation and restriction, is predicated of its entirety. The
   personality of Christ, compounded of the God and the man, would have
   been severed by the abstraction of either. The inspired and unqualified
   ascriptions of suffering to Christ, or, in the language of the
   prevalent theory, to the person of Christ, required for their aliment
   the totality of his person. If, from participation in the agonies of
   the suffering Christ of the Bible, either the man or the God had stood
   dissevered and aloof, the personality of the scriptural sufferer would
   have been gone; the real vicarious sufferer, and the vicarious sufferer
   named in the Gospel, would have ceased to be identical.

   Many other corollaries have been drawn from the phrase, the person of
   Christ, by the advocates of the prevalent theory. A few of these
   corollaries will be noticed here, even at the hazard of a partial
   anticipation of some future branches of our argument. It will hereafter
   appear that the Bible, in addition to its application of the name of
   Christ. to the redeeming sufferer, virtually asserts, in various other
   forms, that the second person of the Trinity suffered for the salvation
   of the world. All these intimations of Scripture are sought to be
   neutralized by the mysterious potency of the phrase, the person of
   Christ.

   Bishop Pearson and Bishop Beveridge, and other advocates of the
   prevalent theory, have ingeniously urged, that, from the intimate
   connexion of the divine and human natures in the person of Christ, the
   God became constructively man, and the man constructively God; and
   that, therefore, the Bible, in virtually declaring that the second
   person of the Trinity suffered and died, meant nothing more than to
   declare that the impassible God constructively suffered and died in the
   suffering and death of the passible man.

   The words of Bishop Pearson are as follows:

   "And now the only difficulty will consist in this, how we can reconcile
   the person suffering with the subject. of his passion; how we can say
   that God did suffer, when we profess the Godhead suffered not. But this
   seeming difficulty will admit an easy solution, if we consider the
   intimate conjunction of the divine and human nature, and their union in
   the person of the Son. For hereby those attributes which properly
   belong to the one are given to the other, and that upon good reason;
   for seeing the same individual person is, by the conjunction of the
   nature of God and the nature of man, really and truly both God and man,
   it necessarily followeth that it is true to say God is man, and as
   true, a man is God; because, in this particular, he which is man is
   God, and he which is God is man" [4]

   The words of Bishop Beveridge are as follows:

   "When he died, God himself may be truly said to have laid down his
   life; for so his beloved disciple saith expressly: "Hereby we perceive
   the love of God, because he laid down his life for us."---

   I John, 3., 16. Strange expressions! Yet not so strange as true, as
   being uttered by truth itself. Neither will they seem strange unto us,
   if we truly believe, and consider that he who suffered all this was and
   is both God and man; not in two distinct persons, as if he was one
   person as God, and another person as man, according to the Nestorian
   heresy; for if so, then his sufferings as man would have been of no
   value for us, nor have stood us in any stead, as being the sufferings
   only of a finite person; but he is both God and man in one and the same
   person, as the third general council declared out of the Holy
   Scriptures, and the Catholic Church always believed. From whence it
   comes to pass, that, although his sufferings affected only the manhood,
   yet that, being at the same time united to the Godhead in one and the
   same person, they therefore were, and may be properly called the
   sufferings of God himself; the person that suffered them being really
   and truly God." [5]

   With profound respect for these learned and pious prelates, we cannot
   but regard their distinctions as too subtile, too involved, too
   metaphysical for gospel simplicity. We must humbly protest against the
   startling dogmas, that, by virtue of the union of the two natures in
   the person of Christ, "those attributes which properly belong to the
   one are given to the oother," and "that it is true to say, "God is man,
   and as true, a man is God." Where are the attributes of almightiness,
   and omniscience, and eternal pre-existence, and creative potency
   "given" to his human nature? Or, where is it affirmed of his divine
   nature that it lacked infinite goodness, or prescience, or power, or
   that it was formed out of nothing in the days of Herod? The Bible's"s
   great Mediator himself taught the infinite distinction between his
   manhood and his Godhead, notwithstanding their union. "My Father is
   greater than I."---John, 14. 28. "Why callest thou me good? there is
   none good but one; that is God."---Matthew, 19. 17. "But to sit on my
   right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but it shall be given to
   them for whom it is prepared of my Father."---Matthew, 20. 23. "But of
   that day and that hour knoweth no man; no, not the angels which are in
   heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."---Mark, 13. 32. Thus it
   appears, from the highest authority in the universe, that,
   notwithstanding the union of the two natures in the person of Christ,
   the man did not become God, or assume the divine attributes. Nor did
   the God sink into the man. Christ recognised, in his divine capacity,
   no inferiority to the Father, either in power, or goodness, or
   prescience.

   The manhood of Christ, then, was not God. The sufferings of his manhood
   were not the sufferings of the Deity. The man did not become
   constructively God; nor were the sufferings of his manhood
   constructively the sufferings of the Diety. If the God was impassive,
   and the man only suffered, his human sufferings touched not his divine
   nature. The Bible would not have styled them the sufferings of the God.
   God the Son suffered not by proxy. He could no more have suffered by
   proxy than he could have become incarnate by proxy. If the God suffered
   not in his ethereal essence, the scriptural declarations of his
   sufferings are not true, in the amplitude of scriptural verity. The
   Bible says nothing of suffering by construction. The thought is not to
   be found in Holy Writ. If is the imagination of the prevalent theory.
   The Son of God suffered not constructively, any more than he formed the
   world constructively. There is nothing constructive, or merely seeming,
   in the actions of the Holy Trinity.

   If, according to the prevalent hypothesis and theory, the divine nature
   is, by its own inherent laws, necessarily wrapped in ever-lasting
   impassibility; if eternal and infinite beatitude belongs to it as an
   inseparable incident, whether it so wills or not, then the term
   suffering could, under no possible circumstances, have been applied by
   Scripture to a person of the Godhead, whether standing by himself in
   unapproached glory, or united to an inferior nature. Impassibility and
   suffering are opposites, as much as light and darkness. They are, in
   respect to each other, foreign and incommunicable properties. Suffering
   cannot be infused into impassibility by the closest proximity or the
   most intimate union. If the God had been really impassive, the
   suffering of the man could no more have been infused into the
   impassible God by construction than the salt of the ocean could be
   constructively infused into the diamond which its waves have ingulfed.
   Suffering could no more be predicated of an infinitely impassible God,
   than sin could be predicated of an infinitely holy God. Suffering is as
   much opposed to the inherent laws of impassibility as sin is opposed to
   the inherent laws of holiness.

   Upon the prevalent theory and its parent hypothesis, the beloved
   disciple could no more have been taught by Inspiration to say as he did
   in truth say in the passage quoted from one of his epistles by Bishop
   Beveridge himself, "Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid
   down his life for us," than he would have been taught by Inspiration to
   say, that the infinitely holy God committed some flagrant sin for the
   redemptions of the world. He might have declared that the man united to
   the God, or the man whose body was the shrine of the God, had "laid
   down his life for us." But the inspired writer could not, if the
   prevalent theory and its parent hypothesis are true, have declared that
   the eternally impassible God had "laid down his life for us;" for that
   would have been declaring that the eternally impassible God had
   violated the immutable laws of his own infinite being. It would have
   been the assertion of a moral, perhaps physical impossibility, and the
   presumptuous application of such assertion to the awful majesty of the
   Godhead.

   The supposition that St. John, and his inspired brethren of the New
   Testament, when they so often declared that God the Son suffered to
   save our sinking race, meant only to indicate the sufferings of the
   man, and to affirm that the human suffering became the suffering of the
   God by construction, is a gratuitous assumption of the advocates of the
   prevalent theory. The inspired declarations are numerous and
   unequivocal. They are couched in simple and plain terms. They include,
   "Within their fair purport and compass, the divine as well as the human
   nature of the person of Christ. There is not the slightest reason for
   supposing that the Holy Ghost meant differently from what he has
   graciously said. It is the prevalent theory, and not the Bible, which
   affirms that the man suffered actually, and the God only
   constructively.

   We have thus followed, through several of its varying aspects, the
   argument of our learned and pious opponents, derived from the phrase,
   the person of Christ; a phrase deemed by them competent to satisfy not
   only the abounding averments of the Bible that Christ suffered, but
   also the affirmation that God : "laid down his life for us," and
   various other like scriptural declarations, indicating that the second
   person of the Trinity actually suffered for the redemption of the
   world. We now propose to bring this far-reaching and high soaring
   argument of the prevalent theory to another test.

   Christ combined in holy union the human son of the Virgin, and he who,
   from everlasting, had filled the right-hand seat of the omnipotent
   throne. This holy union our opponents love to designate by the phrase,
   the person of Christ. The person of Christ, then, combined the finite
   man and the infinite God. The union of the manhood and the Godhead was
   complete and indissoluble. Time never for a moment severed it on earth;
   nor will eternity ever sever it in heaven. The prevalent theory affirms
   that into this holy union the God carried his own primeval felicity,
   and that it remained, in unimpaired perfection, during every hour of
   his terrestrial sojourn. According to this theory, the person of Christ
   enclosed in its bosom, from the manger of Bethlehem to the tomb of
   Joseph, the ineffable felicity of the blessed God. The theory, of
   course, holds that the person of Christ suffered, not by the suffering
   of his whole person, but by that of his manhood alone.

   Suffering consists in the diminution of what would otherwise have been
   the happiness of the sufferer. The amount of the suffering is tested by
   the amount of such diminution. In the case under consideration, the
   person of Christ was the sufferer. What, then, was the diminution of
   the felicity of the person of Christ, caused by the mere suffering of
   his manhood? We have no weight or measure to ascertain it; but brief
   reflection will teach us that it must have been inconceivably small.
   The happiness of the person of Christ, if his divinity tasted not of
   suffering, was infinite. It embraced the plenitude of the felicity of
   the Godhead. According to the prevalent theory, the suffering of the
   person of Christ was finite. It consisted in the suffering of the man
   alone. Subtract finite suffering from infinite beatitude, and the
   diminution will be too small for the most microscopic vision. Heavy as
   no doubt were the sufferings of Christ's"s humanity, when estimated by
   an earthly standard, they must have been comparatively light when taken
   in reference to the person of him "who hath measured the waters in the
   hollow of his hand," and "taketh up the isles as a very little
   thing."---Isaiah, 40. 12, 15. The bitter stream of human wo must have
   been absorbed and lost in the illimitable ocean of divine felicity. If
   you subtract a single grain of sand from the globe we inhabit,
   arithmetic can perceive, and perhaps estimate the diminution; but the
   subtraction of the suffering of the finite man from the felicity of the
   person of Christ, embracing the full beatitude of the infinite God,
   would have caused a diminution of bliss too small for creature
   perception. Doubtless the ken of an archangel could not have perceived
   it. The happiness of the person of Christ, subject to his human
   suffering, must have been incalculably greater even at Gethsemane and
   Calvary, if the God suffered not in his ethereal essence, than the
   happiness of any other person who ever dwelt in this lower world,
   including the days of Eden. It must have surpassed the felicity of any
   other being in the universe, save that of the Father and the Holy
   Ghost. The minute atom of his human suffering, compared with the mighty
   totality of his divine beatitude, was less than the scarcely
   perceptible speck that often passes over without obscuring the orb of
   day.

   Yet the Bible everywhere darkly shadows forth the sufferings of Christ,
   or, if our opponents prefer the phrase, the sufferings of the person of
   Christ, as having been too intense and vast for even Inspiration
   intelligibly to express in mortal language. The dimly portrayed
   sufferings darkened the face of day; they convulsed the earth; they
   must have wrung tears from heavenly eyes; they shook, well-nigh to
   dissolution, the person of the incarnate God. And was it, indeed, the
   mere finite suffering of Clhirist's"s humanity, bearing a less
   proportion to the totality of his infinite bliss than the glow-worm
   bears to the luminary of our system, that the Bible thus labours, and
   labours, as it were, in vain, adequately to express to mortal ears? No!
   The sufferings, in the delineation of which even Inspiration seems to
   falter, were not limited to the finite, but pervaded also the most
   sacred recesses of that infinite essence which went to constitute the
   holy union, styled by our opponents the person of Christ. The
   sufferings of the man lay within the limits of scriptural delineation.
   The agonies of the God none but a God could conceive. Perhaps even
   Omnipotence could not make them intelligible to creature apprehension.

   The theory which holds that the suffering element in the person of
   Christ was only the little speck of his humanity, with the inference to
   which it inevitably leads of the minuteness of the subtraction from the
   bliss of his united person caused by the suffering of that human speck,
   cannot but detract immeasurably from the dignity and glory of the
   atonement. It sinks the expiatory sufferings of the person of Christ
   from their scriptural infinitude down to a point too small for mortal,
   doubtless too small for angelic vision.

   The position that, of the two natures united in the person of Christ,
   the one suffered and the other never tasted of suffering; that the one
   was filled to overflowing with unutterable anguish and the other with
   inconceivable joy; that the one drank to its dregs "the cup of
   trembling," while the other was quaffing the ocean of more than
   seraphic beatitude, can derive no support from human reason. Such a
   theory, tending, as it does in no small degree, to augment, "the
   mystery of godliness," required plenary scriptural proof for its
   support. Its advocates have not furnished such proof. In the face of
   the Christian world, we affectionately, yet solemnly invoke its
   production, if to be found in the Word of God.

CHAPTER VII.

   Natures of Christ concurred and participated in all his Sayings and
   Doings---So in Heaven and on Earth---All his Sayings and Doings were in
   his Mediatorial Character, requiring Concurrence and Participation of
   United Natures---No Exception in Article of Suffering---Examples of
   Concurrence and Participation---Farther Examples, in case of
   Miracles---Moanings on Cross in United Natures---Mediation a Suffering
   Mediation---Eternal Son "emptiedcl himself" of his Beatitude as wen as
   Glory on becoming incarnate.

   THE concurrence and participation of the divine and human natures of
   Christ, according to the measure of their respective capacities, in all
   his sayings and doings, is a doctrine fairly deducible from the Word of
   God. The elucidation of this great truth will be the object of the
   present chapter.

   The concurrence and participation of the two natures of Christ in all
   his sayings and doings subsequent to his resurrection and ascension
   will not be disputed. The man ascended with the God to heaven; he is
   seated with the God at the right hand of the Highest; he will come with
   the God, in the clouds of heaven, to judge the world in righteousness.
   The stupendous words closing the mediatorial drama, "Come, ye blessed,"
   and "Depart from me, ye cursed," will be pro-nounced by those very lips
   from whence proceeded that never-to-be-forgotten sermon on the mount,
   so fraught with fearful truths, so abounding in gracious benedictions.
   It would have seemed a strange anomaly, if there had not existed the
   like concurrence and participation of the divine and human natures of
   the incarnate God in all the sayings and doings of his earthly
   pilgrimage.

   No such anomaly is indicated by the Word of God. On the contrary, it it
   a clear inference from Holy Writ that the two natures of Christ
   concurred and participated, according to the measure of their
   respective capacities, in all his sayings and doings, from his birth in
   the manger until the "cloud received him" out of the sight of his
   steadfastly-gazing disciples.

   The terrestrial sojourn of the second person of the Trinity, clothed in
   flesh, was wholly mediatorial. It was the discharge of the arduous
   duties of his mediatorial office that called him down to earth and
   detained him there. When its terrestrial duties were done he
   re-ascended to his native heavens. In the structure of the mediatorial
   office, the constituent elements were divinity and manhood. The
   concurrence and participation of both these elements were
   indispensable. Had the Godhead withdrawn its full concurrence and
   participation, the mediatorial work must have stood still, as did once
   the sun on Gibeon. The prevalent theory will not deny our general
   position; but it seeks to carve out an exception in the article of
   suffering. The exception can find no scriptural passage whereon to rest
   the sole of its foot. The Bible everywhere speaks of the second person
   of the Trinity, arrayed in manhood, not only as an incarnate, but also
   as a suffering Mediator.

   We have seen that the name of Christ, in some one of its synonymes,
   occurs sixteen hundred and twenty-five times in the New Testament. The
   name is to be found eight hundred and thirty-one times in the four
   Gospels, and seven hundred and ninety-four between the end of the
   Gospels and the close of Revelation. In no one of these sixteen hundred
   and twenty-five instances is there the slightest intimation that, from
   the general rule requiring the concurrence and participation of the two
   natures of Christ in all his mediatorial sayings and doings, there was
   an exception carved out in the article of suffering. The omission could
   not have occurred sixteen hundred and twenty-five times by accident or
   inadvertence. It was the Holy Ghost who spoke; and he spoke to settle
   the landmarks of human faith. This ominous omission spontaneously
   multiplies itself into sixteen hundred and twenty-five scriptural
   arguments against the existence of the alleged exception.

   The redeeming God and the redeeming man were born into our world
   together. They spent together the long interval between infancy and
   manhood. At the maturity of the man, they together began and continued
   to preach glad tidings to the poor; they went about in concert doing
   good. It was in fulfilment of the duties of his mediatorial office that
   "Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their
   synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every
   sickness, and every disease among the people."---Matthew, 9. 35.

   When the wearied Emanuel sat down on Jacob's"s well, and craved of the
   wondering woman a draught of its cooling beverage, it was less to
   refresh the frail mortal than to afford the in-dwelling God an occasion
   to plant a twig of the tree of life in the moral desert of Samaria. In
   his solitary and prolonged prayers, the God concurred and participated
   with the man. To instruct, as well as to save the world, was the
   purpose of his mediatorial mission. The duty of frequent and retired
   devotion was one of the primary lessons taught, practically as well as
   theoretically, by this Schoolmaster from above. In the solitude of
   night, on the lonely mountain, the God, too, might best resume his
   sweet communion with the beloved brethren of his everlasting reign. It
   was the King of Zion, in his united natures, who, in fulfilment of an
   inspired prediction, rode into Jerusalem, "lowly and meek, and sitting
   upon an ass, and a colt, the foal of an ass."---Matthew, 21. 5.
   Zechariah, 9. 9. When Jesus mourned over the devoted, yet still beloved
   city which had killed the prophets and stoned those who had come to it
   as messengers of grace, his pathetic wailing betokened less the
   yearning of his human heart than the travail of his divine spirit.

   In all the miracles of Christ, his two natures, according to the
   measure of their respective capacities, concurred and participated. The
   man was bidden to the marriage of Cana; the God there accomplished his
   "beginning of miracles." It was the man whose hand was laid upon the
   sick and the suffering; it was the God who imparted to that hand its
   healing power. It was the corporeal substance of Jesus that walked upon
   the waves; it was his ethereal essence that upheld it there. It was the
   hand of the man that broke the "five barley loaves" and the "two small
   fishes;" it was the potency of the God that multiplied, and multiplied,
   and multiplied them into superabundant aliment for five thousand
   famished persons. It was the body of the man that was transfigured on
   the mountain; it was the mandate of the God that made "his face shine
   as the sun, and his raiment white as the light," and that summoned
   Moses and Elias from heaven, to behold the prospective glory of the
   incarnate Deity. It was the voice of the man that called Lazarus forth
   from the grave; it was the fiat of the God which forced even the
   reluctant grave to yield up its victim.

   "Jesus wept." His tears were not the ebullitions of mere human
   sympathy. He had foreseen the decease of his friend, and might have
   averted it by his presence or his mandate. He was just about, by the
   mere word of his power, to reanimate the dead. The physician weeps not,
   though the symptoms, may wring tears from surrounding relatives, if he
   knows that, by a touch of his lancet, he can at once restore health and
   cheerfulness. The tomb of Lazarus symbolized a world "dead in
   trespasses and sins." Over the grave of that world destroyed Jesus
   stood, and "Jesus, wept." The word even of Omnipotence could not
   reanimate moral death. For that malady, the only cure was the blood of
   God. Jesus wept as a man; more especially as a God did Jesus weep.

   page 95If the two natures of Christ thus concurred and participated in
   the multifarious sayings and doings of his mediatorial life, why should
   the epoch of suffering have wrought a severance in natures which had
   become united and indivisible? We have already seen that the God lacked
   not physical or moral capacity to suffer. We have justly inferred that
   suffering, actual, not figurative, was the object for which he had left
   the heavenly reins of universal government to wear the humble weeds of
   humanity. Why, then, should his divinity have retiredr6ti@e@& into
   abeyance from the impending conflict. leaving its frail earthly
   associateLt6@ to trea,@d aljoneo "the wine-press of the fierceness and
   wrath of Almighty God?"

   The uncreated Son did not retire from the impending conflict. He bore
   his own infinite share of the curse of sin. Golgotha felt, in the
   trembling of its solid mount, the viewless and nameless throes of the
   suffering God. Whose voice was it that uttered the, heaven-piercing
   cry, "My God!, my God! why hast thou forsaken me?" It was the same
   voice that had commanded the winds and the waves, and they obeyed. It
   was the same voice which had assumed the awful appellation of the Old
   Testament, "I AM." It was the same voice that had; declared, ",I and my
   Father are one."

   The wailing, voice, was, of course, the voice of96 the sufferer. If it
   was the united voice of his combined " natures, then, beyond
   peradventure, the natures unitedly suffered. Those who affirm that the
   divine essence did not participate in the moan, encounter the more than
   Sisyphean task of demonstrating that the in-dwelfling God had retired
   from the scene of wo, leaving the struggling man alone; that the divine
   voice which called Lazarus forth from the grave was hushed in profound
   silence; and that the piteous cries from Calvary were the mere "human"
   wailings of Mary's son. The son of mere an the Virgin was not the
   forsaken of his God. His own God, his kindred God, his sympathizing,
   indwelling God would never, for a moment, have forsaken him. To him his
   in-dwelling God was bound by ties indissoluble. But the incarnate Deity
   was himself writhing under the more than scorpion sting of the sins of
   a world. The forsaken of God was, alas! the in-dwelling God himself.
   The forsaken of the Father was the Father's own, only-begotten,
   well-beloved, eternal Son. The wailing voice, in anticipation of which
   the luminary of day had hidden its saddened face, was the same voice
   which, at the beginning, had spoken that luminary into being. The other
   dying cry from the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what
   they do," was also of that same divine and forgiving Voice, who, "
   walking in the garden in the cool of the day," had. cheered -the"
   despairing hearts of the guilty, penite"nt pair wWith the distant, yet
   radiant vision of ever-cherishe"d, ever-brightening hope.---Genesis,
   3iii. 8, 15. -

   The prevalent theory might as well seek to exclude the participation of
   the divinity from any other department of the mediatorial office as
   from its suffering department. The Bible declares that Christ went
   about preaching the " gospel of the kingdom." The Bible declares that
   Christ wrought a succession of stupendous miracles. The Bible declares
   that Christ suffered for the redemrhption of the world. Each
   declaration designates the Actor by the name of Christ, or one of its
   synonymes. Each declaration is couched in the same unequivocal terms,
   without exception, restriction, or qualification. Each declaration
   pervades the united natures of the Messiah. The prevalent theory has
   singled out the pains of the suffering department as the sole subject
   of its exclusion of divine participation. Why this distinction? @ There
   is the same scriptural evidence of the participation of the God. in the
   mniediatorial sufferings as there is of the participation of the God in
   the preaching of the gospel or the working of the miracles. lf the
   mediatorial Preacher of the gospel was the God-man in his united
   natures; if the mediatorial Worker of the miracles was the God-man in
   his united "natures, so must the mediatorial Sufferer have been the
   God-man in his united natures. Any distinction is Arbitrary. It has no
   scriptural authority

   There was no peculiar exigency in the preaching of the gospel or the
   working of the miracles, specially requiring the actual presence of the
   Deity. Peter and Pauli preached the gospel and wrought miracles without
   an in-dwelling God. His dele gated authority sufficed, while he himself
   remained

   "high and lifted up" on his celestial throne. But there was a special
   and peculiar reason requiring the actual presence and participation of
   the God in the agonies of the suffering department. His actual
   participation alone gave to those agonies their redeeming value. He
   could communicate, without his actual presence, the right to preach the
   gospel and the power to work miracles. The infinite burden of suffering
   for the redemption of man was incommunicable. It was to be borne by the
   God, not by his substitute. The God was himself to suffer, not merely
   the man substituted for the God. The man was to bear the finite share,
   the God the infinite share of the expiatory agonies.

   The union between the second person of the Trinity and his terrestrial
   adjunct was intimate beyond conception. They were one and indivisible.
   The duration of the union was to be eternal. They now share together
   the glory of heaven. The inference seems inevitable that they must have
   shared together the sufferings of earth. We believe that severance in
   suffering would have been as incompatible with the laws of their union
   as severance in glory.

   Disjoining the two inseparable natures of Christ in the paramount
   article of his expiatory suffering, is the deep-rooted error of the
   prevalent theory. The Bible affirms that Jesus Christ suffered--that
   Jesus Christ died--for the salvation of man. The theory
   conducts--unwittingly no doubt--to the conclusion that Jesus Christ
   died not-suffered not. The suffering, dying Jesus Christ of the Bible
   was compounded of the finite man, and the infinite Jehovah; both
   natures indispensable to the constitution of his personality. Had the
   infinite nature been dissevered from participation with the finite in
   the article of suffering, the personality of the scriptural sufferer
   must have been lost; the suffering, dying victim for mortal sins would
   have been, not "the Christ of God," but the human son of the Virgin;
   and the sole suffering and death of Mary's human son would have left
   wholly unsatisfied the abounding and unqualified scriptural
   declarations that Jesus Christ was the sufferer--that Jesus Christ
   died.

   The mediation between God and man was a suffering mediation. Its
   element was suffering. In suffering it began; in suffering was it
   "finished." In all that pertained to this suffering mediation, both
   natures of the incarnate Deity concurred and participated, according to
   the measure of their respective capacities. The man did all that
   humanity could do; the God did all that infinite love could prompt.
   Neither of the two natures was at any time inert; neither in a state of
   abeyance.

   In the first mediatorial movement, the God was the sole Actor. He
   became incarnate ; he cast off "the form of God;" he "emptied himself"
   of his celestial glory; he took upon him the "form of a servant;" he
   became the lowly son of a lowly Virgin; he was born in a manger, and
   wrapped in its straw. That the manger actually contained, and that its
   straw actually covered Him who formed the worlds was no fiction. The
   miraculous star and the worship of the Oriental wise men demonstrated a
   present Deity. The star was not an ignis fatuus to lure men into
   idolatry. The everlasting mandate, " worship God," was not forgotten in
   heaven. Sufferance was the object for which the second person of the
   Sacred Three thus "humbled himself." In the conclave of the Godhead it
   had been deemed most fitting that he should suffer clothed in the flesh
   of fallen man. The humiliation was real; the transformation not
   metaphorical; the suffering was actual.

   In the manger of Bethlehem the son of Mary began to enact his humble
   part. The incarnate God, in early iniiifancy, was carried into Egypt.
   It,, was a hurried, wintry journey, marked with all the privations of
   penury. Back again was he hurried to the land of Israel, not to find
   his native home there; for, " being warned of God in a dream," his
   parents turned aside, to dwell obscure and destitute in the city of
   Nazareth. In all these privations, He who, from everlasting, had
   occupied the right-hand throne of glory, concurred and participated.
   Into his distressed estate he carried not the beatitude of his
   celestial home. He had "46 emptied himself" " of that, as well as of "
   the form of God." The second who bears "record in heaven" was, in very
   truth, on the earth, "wounded for our transgressions," and "bruised for
   our iniquities." ",The allegation of the prevalent theory, that the
   second person of the Trinity, in becoming incarnate, "emptied himself"
   of his glory alone, retaining in full perfection all his infinite
   beatitude, has no other foundation than the imagination of its
   advocates. Transcendent, indeed, is the glory of God. Moses could not
   have seen it, in all its effulgence, and lived.---Exodus, 33xxxiii. 18,
   20. Of the glory of the Highest we would speak with humility and fear;
   yet we trust that, without irreverence, we may be permitted to suppose
   that it pertains rather to the expression of his ineffable excellence
   than to that intrinsic excellence itself. lt is the external
   manifestation of inherent, viewless, and infinite perfection. The glory
   of God is the robe of majesty in which he arrays himself ",as with a
   garment." His beatitude dwells within, while his glory unceasingly
   surrounds him, as the halo sometimes circles the luminary of day. The
   supposition that the God, about to become incarnate, cast aside his
   glory alone, retaining and carrying with him to earth his infinite
   beatitude, is opposed to the letter and the spirit of the declarations
   of the Holy Ghost.

   We read in Oriental story of Eastern monarchs doffing their regal
   attire, and traversing their domains in peasant weeds, to become the
   unknown spectators of the variegated and bustling drama of social life,
   retaining, during their metamorphosis, all their royal felicity, and
   bringing it back with them untouched to their thrones. Such was not the
   holy transformation of the Son of God. To mark its reality and
   completeness, the Holy Ghost selected the most potent expressions found
   in human speech; expressions too strong for the fastidiousness of
   modern translators; expressions unsatisfied by the doffing of the mere
   external robes of majesty ; expressions pervading the inner being, and
   reaching that vital region of sensation and life where beatitude
   dwells. The God about to become incarnate could not have been said to
   have " emptied himself," in the full meaning of the mighty terms, if
   the infinitude of his celestial blessedness accompanied him through his
   earthly pilgrimage; making the straw of the manger as downy a pillow as
   the bosom of his Father; the revilings, and scoffings, and hissingys of
   the crucifying mob as little annoying as the hallelujahs of heaven; the
   garden and the cross as redolent of bliss as his celestial throne.

   The emptying himself of his infinite beatitude was peculiarly
   appropriate to the God, about to become an incarnate sufferer.
   Suffering was the object of his terrestrial mission. The suffering of
   its Creator was the price to be paid for the redemption of a lost
   world. To qualify him for his suffering office, it was needful that the
   self-devoted Mediator should divest himself of his primitive
   blessedness. " The Captain of our salvation" could not carry the
   beatific peace of heaven along with him into his terrible campaign on
   earth. It was not with gleeful heart, any more than in triumphal robes,
   that " the wine press of the wrath and fierceness of Alimnighlityv God"
   was to be trodden.

   The, redeeming God was present, and partaking in all the wanderings and
   hardships of the redeeming man. He was baptized by the reluctant and
   trembling John. On him rested the descending dove. For him the voice
   from heaven proclaimed once, and again, and yet again, " This is my
   beloved Son." The elements recognized and obeyed the present Deity.
   Devils believed and trembled. He forgave sins. He proclaimed hbimrhself
   " Lord even of the Sabbath day." He toiled with his own hbands. The
   Architect of the universe became a laborious carpenter in the workshop
   of Joseph. Of his divinity as well as his manhood was uttered the
   pathetic exclamation, " The son of man hath not where to lay his head."
   The Creator of the world found in it no spot of repose until the kind
   grave received him. He was steeped " in poverty to the very lips." To
   pay the tribute money which the law exacted, he was obliged to work a
   miracle.

   The manner in which human reason---at least the reason of the
   learnmed---has met and received the declarations of Scripture, that the
   eternal Son suffered for our redemption, is a curiosity in theological
   literature. It has rejected the glorious mass of this celestial truth,
   and clung only to a fragment. It has gratuitously limited the unlimited
   declarations of heaven, that the eternal Son suffered for our sins, by
   the earth-born amendment, "except in his divine nature." The exception
   nearly absorbs the totality of the blessed truth. The remnaniit left
   bears a less proportion to the majestic whole than the scarcely
   perceptible promontory bears to the mighty continent of which it forms
   so inconsiderable a part.

   To this exception of its own creation, human reason has clung with a
   tenacity which the lapse of centuries has not been able to sever. On
   what basis does the exception rest? Not on the basis of the Bible; for
   the declarations of Scripture are unqualified and without exception;
   they are as munificent and illimitable as the love of the self-devoted
   God. The exception is the progeny, not of the Bible, but of that
   long-continued and widespread hypothesis, " God is impassible." If this
   hypothesis should be exploded from Christian theology, the exception
   which it has engendered would sink, with its parent into nothl-iing.
   That the hypothesis itself was but the offspring of human reasoning, we
   have already shown.

   We profoundly reverence science. It has transmuted into plain and
   palpable truth, that which, without it, might have seemed poetic
   rhapsody. ,,"WWhat a piece of work is man! how noble in reason! how
   infinite in faculties! in formrm and moving, how express and admirable!
   in action, how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a God!" Nor
   does science ever appear so majestic as when wearing its sacred tiara.
   Yet has science pride. Even sacred science is not always as humble as
   was its "meek and lowly" " Master.

   "In pride, in reasoning pride"72 its "error lies."

   el

   Else, why has it scaled the heavens and tried to bind the Omnipotent in
   its own puny chains. Else, why has it denied to the eternal Son, the
   ineffable personification of infinite love, his high prerogative of
   self-sacrifice to redeemrn a ruined world, and perhaps, save a universe
   threatened by an inundation of triumphant sin?

CHAPTER VIII.

   Had there been any Distinction between the two natures of Christ in the
   Article of Suffering, it would have been indicated in the
   Bible--@Intellectual Character of Pau,,il---Two passages from 1 Peter,
   declaring that Christ suffered in the Flesh,; considered and
   explained---Bishop Pea carson again examiniied---Term Flesh,. when
   applied to Christ, designates his whole united Being---Term Body, when
   applied to Christ, has the same comprehensive Meaning---So has the term
   Man---Terms Crucified and Cross.

   HAD there been any distinction between the two natures of Christ in the
   essential, the paramount article of suffering, it was not only to be
   expected, but it was important that the inspired writers should have
   pointed it out. It would have been one of the landmarks of Christian
   faith, not to be left afloat at the mercy of opinion. The inspired
   writers had been well schooled in the doctrines taught by the Holy
   Ghost, and were fully competent to expound them with simplicity and
   precision.

   Take, for instance, the great apostle of the Gentiles; and at the
   mention of the name of Paul, we cannot withhold the expression of our
   admiration of his wonderful endowments, even at the hazard of a
   momentary deviation from the straight and onward pathway of our
   argument. For profoundness of intellect ; for loftiness of imagination
   ; for that glowing enthusiasm which breathes into genius the breath of
   life, he stood unsurpassed among the sons of humanity. Had terrestrial
   ambition contented him, he might have been the Demosthenes of his
   oppressed country, thundering forth against Roman domination the same
   pierceiniig bolts which the Athenian statesman, and patriot, and orator
   hurled at the head of Philip. He had drunk copiously of ",the sweets of
   sweet philosophy;" with the choicest treasures of the Grecian muse, he
   was familiar as with "household words;" but all his mental wealth and
   literary acquisitions were laid humbly at the feet of his Redeemer. The
   variegated and lucid colouring, and the richest flowers that he had
   gathered in the fertile fields of learning, he freely offered up to
   make more clear the lineaments, and to deck the lovely brow of that
   meek and lowly religion which had been cradled in the manger of
   Bethlehem, and brought up among the fishermen of Galilee.

   Paul, so deeply instructed in the lore of Inspiration; Paul, who had
   been caught up into the third heaven, and shown things which it was not
   lawful for him to intimate "to ears of flesh and blood, " could not
   have been ignorant of the kind and extent of his Saviour's sufferings ;
   and had there existed a distinction between his two natures in the
   grand article of suffering, the philosophic, the logical, the lucid,
   the discriminating Paul would not have failed to indicate it somewhere
   in his voluminoutis writings, even if omitted by the less-exteniided
   authors of the New Testament. It is not intimated by any of the
   inspired writers, because it was not intimated to any of them by the
   Holy Ghost. The distinction is earth-born. The general scriptural
   declarations of Christ's sufferings, then, according to every
   legitimate rule of construction, apply to his divine and human natures
   unitedly. The Bible not having severed their meaning, it is as
   indivisible as the two natures of Christ.

   St. Peter, indeed, speaks of Christ having suffered and died for us in
   the flesh. There are two passages in which this affirmation is made by
   that apostle. The first is as follows: " For Christ also hath once
   suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to
   God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit."--@1
   l Peter, 3iii. 18. The second passage is as follows: "Forasmuch, then,
   as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise
   with the same mind." ---1 Peter, 4iv. 1. Bishop Pearson has invoked
   these two passages into the support of the prevalent, theory that
   Christ'"s sufferings were confined to his humanity. [6] And as they are
   the only scriptural passages which he has cited as bearing directly on
   the subject, we are doubtless justified in concluding that they were
   the only ones he could find. With the profoundest respect for the
   learned and pious prelate, we are constrained to dissent from his
   construction. Several answers may be given to the argument sought to be
   derived from these passages.

   First.. St. Peter might have meant to speak only of the time of
   Christ'"s passion, not of its locality. He might have intended to say
   that Christ suffered while he was in the flesh on earth, not that his
   flesh, or even his manhood, was the sole or peculiar recipient of his @
   suffering. In his epistle to the Hebrews, St. Paul, when referring to
   the "prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears," offered
   up by Christ, designated their date by the words, " in the days of his
   flesh."---Hebrews, 5v. 7. So St. Peter may, perhaps, be understood as-
   having merely declared that Christ suffered and died "in the days of
   his flesh."

   Secondly.. The passages from 1 Peter contain nothing beyond the simple
   affirmation that Christ suffered and died in the flesh, a proposition
   that no one of modem times is wild enough to deny. But they contain no
   declaration that he did not also suffer in his spirit, human and
   divine. The participation of his divinity in his sufferings is entirely
   compatible with the passages. The expression of the existence of one
   thing is, indeed, sometimes held to be the exclusion of the existence
   of a correlative thing. But that rule cannot govern the present case6.
   The aim of the apostle, in the chapters from whence these passages are
   taken, and also in the preceding chapter, was to impress on his
   brethren the duty of following the example of Christ, especially in the
   article of suffering. To give the more point to his appeal, he might
   natu. rally have placed in its front ground the outward and visible
   suffering of their common master. It would not be surprising if, on
   this particular occasion, he designed to present rather the imitable
   example of the suffering man than the imnimitable example of the
   suffering God, as the pattern to be followed by the suffering faithful.
   So that the declarations in I Peter, that Christ suffered in the flesh,
   even taking the term flesh in its restricted and literal sense, are not
   an exclusion, express or implied, of the conclusion that he also
   suffered in both of his immaterial substances.

   Thirdly. But the most conclusive answer to the passages from I Peter
   remains to be stated. And as this additional solution commingles itself
   with various other matters of debate between the advocates of the
   prevalent theory and ourselves, we shall be excused if we examine it a
   little more in detail than we should have deemed necessary, had a reply
   to the passages from I Peter been the sole object in view. The Bible
   often employs expressions, applicable, in their primary and strict
   sense, to the outer being only, to designate also the inner being. Thus
   the term flesh, in its primary and literal import, expresses only the
   body. But it is often used figuratively in Scripture to include the
   immaterial as well as the material part of man. Take the following
   samples of this scriptural use of the term: " I will not fear what
   flesh can do unto me," exclaimed the Psalmist.---Psalm, 56Ivi. 4. And
   again: " For he remembereth that they were but flesh."--@Psalm,rn
   78lxxviii. 39. " No flesh shall have peace," saith the
   prophet.---Jeremiah, 12xii. 12. And again: "Cursed be the man that
   trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm."--" Jeremiah, 17. 5.. "For
   all flesh is grass," declared the apostolic Peter.---I Peter, 1i. 24.

   The incarnate God had flesh. The flesh in which he dwelt became the
   peculiar flesh of the eternal Word. It was moulded out of the common
   mass of human flesh, and was set apart and consecrated as the
   appropriate flesh of the Son of God.- It is now his raised and
   glorified flesh, seated at the right hand of his Father. Though the
   corporeal garment, in which he clothed himself, was taken originally
   from the great storehouse of humanity, it became unspeakably exalted by
   the transcendent dignity of its divine wearer.

   The term flesh, applied by St. Peter to the incarnmate God, in the
   passages so much relied on by Bishop Pearson, was, we have little
   doubt, a figure of speech to denote the whole united person of the
   Redeemer, human and divine. That the apostle used the term
   figuratively, at least to a certain extent, will not be denied by the
   generality of our opponents. Few of them will contend for the
   unscriptural position, that the sufferings of our Lord were confined
   literally to his body. It would ill comport with the generally received
   conceptions to suppose that mere " corporal sufferance" was accepted by
   the infinite Father as a full propitiation for the transgressions of
   the world. Even the advocates of the prevalent theory will, therefore,
   geni-ierally understand the declarations of St. Peter to import mental
   as well as bodilyv sufferingo-,s. But, in their allowance of a
   figurative meaning to his declarations, the advocates of the prevalent
   theory stop short at the line separating Christ's"s human soul from his
   ethereal essence. Why stop at that line? Inspiration has left no
   landmark there. The landmark there, which has appeared for ages, is an
   earthly structure, reared by human hands. If the scriptural meaning of
   the term flesh, when applied to man, has ample capacity to comprehend
   the corporeal and immaterial natures of our whole aggregate race, why
   may not the scriptural meaning of the same term, when applied to the
   fles h of the incarnate Word, be capacious enough to include both of
   the united natures of the Son of God, though the chief element in the
   immaterial part of his united natures was his ethereal essence?

   That the term flesh, in scriptural language, when applied to the
   incarnate God, includes his whole united being, human and divine, is
   not left to be deduced by any mere reasoning process. "And the Word was
   made flesh, and dwelt among us."---John, 1i. 14. Here the flesh
   consecrated by the in-dwelling Deity was clearly used to denote both
   his natures. But for this scriptural meaning of the term when thus
   divinely applied, we have still more explicit authority, coming direct
   from the lips of one of the Holy Three. "I am the living bread which
   came down from heaven: if a man eat of this bread, he shall live
   forever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give
   for the life of the world."---John, 6vi. 51. In this passage, Christ
   used the terms " my flesh" to designate that " living bread which came
   from heaven;" which he gave "for the life of the world" " and of which,
   if any man eats, " he shall live forever." He employed the terms to
   denote the whole infinite totality of his mediatorial sacrifice. He
   used them as an appropriate name, when applied to himself, to
   comprehend, not only his body and human soul, but also that ethereal
   Essence, who had, from everlasting, occupied the right-hand throne of
   heaven.

   If St. Peter used the term flesh, in the two passages under review,
   according to its scriptural meaning when applied to Christ---a meaning
   which he himself had heard his beloved Master ordain and establish by
   the word of his own supremacy-- then the conclusion is inevitable, that
   the apostle meant to declare that our Saviour had suffered and died in
   both his united natures. He used the term without exception or
   restriction, and must be understood to have intended all that the term
   imports. If this conclusion is correct, then the two passages from I
   Peter, invoked and marshalled against us by the modern representative
   of the prevalent theory as competent of themselves to vanquish all
   opposition, are found in the day of trial, though forming his whole
   array, to leave the service into which they had been impressed, and,
   passing over into our ranks, to form two of the chief supporters of our
   argument.

   So the word body has its figurative meaning, and is often used to
   denote the inner as well as the outer man. Hence the expressions
   "somebody" and "nobody." Hence, when we use the colloloquial phrase
   ",everybody," so constantly repeated in common parlance, we include not
   only the bodies, but also the spirits of all to whom we refer. The
   Scripture has borrowed the same figurative use of the word body, and
   applied it even to Christ. " And you, that were some time alienated and
   enemies in your mind by wicked works, yvet now hath he reconciled in
   the body of his fle@sh through death."---Colossians, 1i. 21, 22. "By
   the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of
   Jesus Christ once for all."---Hebrews, 10x. 1I0O. "Who his own self
   bare our sins in his own body on the tree."---l Peter, 2ii. 24. In
   these passages, the inspired writers used not the word "body" merely to
   denliote the clay tabernacle of Christ; for then would they have made
   his sufferings literally and strictly corporeal, thereby sinking their
   dignity from the infinite to the finite. They used the term "body" as
   expressive, not only of the outward visible materiality, but also of
   the immaterial, breathing, living principle within.

   When our Lord, at the institution of his commemorative supper, gave to
   his disciples the sacramental bread, declaring "This is my body," he
   did not mean that the body of which the bread was symbolical consisted
   of the mere corporeal temple of his flesh. That alone was not the price
   to be paid for the redemption of the world. The terms "my body,"
   according to the sublime meaning of the divine speaker, comprehended
   the in-dwelling God, whose self-sacrifice was to sanctify that outer
   temple, and form a glorious structure of salvation worthy of its great
   Architect. The consecrated bread was typical, not only of the material,
   but also of the viewless and spiritual substance of the God incarnate.
   The terms were used by Christ to represent and designate the whole
   infinitude of his united being.

   The scriptural custom of using the outer name to denote the inner being
   is exemplified in a still more striking instance. The second person of
   the Trinity, shrouded in flesh, was often called man by his own
   inspired apostles. Even he, who was caught up into the third heaven,
   frequently so teri-med his beloved and divine Master. Ye men of Israel,
   hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among
   you."---Acts, 2ii. 22. "Because he hath appointed a day, in the which
   he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath
   ordained."---Acts, 17xvii. 31. "For if through the offence of one many
   be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by
   one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many."---Romans, 5v. 15.
   There is " one mediator between God and men, th e man Christ
   Jesus."---l Timothy, 2ii. 5. ",But this man, after he had offered one
   sacrifice for sins, forever sat down on the right hand of
   God."---Hebrews, 10x. 12 . These inspired writers well knew---they felt
   in every pulsation of their throbbing hearts-- the melting, the
   exalting truth, that the manhood of their Redeemer bore a less
   proportion to his Godhead than the dim and fading star of morning bears
   to " the glorious king of day rejoicing in the east." "Yet they called
   him man. They thus gave a seeming prominence to his manhood, only as a
   faint emblem---a shadowy figure of the ineffable splendours of the
   Godhead throned within.

   But this scriptural usage is not of universal prevalence. .Qqualifying
   expressions often intervene in the sacred text to create exceptions.
   Thus, where, in speaking of Christ, the apostle declared, " He was
   crucified through weakness."---2 Corinthians, 13xiii. 4,---the term
   "crucified" must, in the particular instance, have meant the
   crucifixion of the body of our Lord by the wood and irons of the cross,
   without reference to those spiritual sufferings, which constituted, no
   doubt, the infinite ingredient in the price of man's"s salvation. The
   body was " crucified through weakness." The incorporeal substance
   throned within felt not, either in its divine or mortal element, the
   distorting wood or the lacerating irons.

   Buoyed up, as was the vicarious victim, "for the joy set before him,"
   the wood and the nails of the cross affected his human soul no more,
   perhaps, than they did his ethereal essence. They scarcely moved even
   the hoping, believing, exulting spirit of the penitent thief; they
   checked not the dying transports of the early Christian martyrs. It was
   the body of Christ, and not his spirit, either in its celestial or
   human constituent, that was " crucified through weakness." It is by its
   figurative use alone that the cross was made to" shadow forth in Holy
   Writ those viewless, nameless agonies which pervaded the inner being of
   the incarnate God. The term "crucified" in the passage under
   consideration, was restricted to its literal import by the qualifying
   adjunct.

   Yet when applied in all its metaphorical amplitude to the sufferer on
   Calvary, the cross has a meaning high as heaven and vast as eternity.
   Though it strictly affected only the corporeal substance of our Lord,
   yet, when figuratively expanded, it includes also the vicarious
   sufferings of his human soul, and shadows forth to the awe stricken
   imagination those ineffable agonies which filled to overflowing the
   infinitude of his divine nature. The CROSS, in its ordinary scriptural
   import, is perhaps the most thrilling term to be found in the
   vocabularies of earth. The CROSS, the visible memorial of the humbled
   God---the suffering God ---is a term in itself, indeed, brief and
   simple, yet presenting to the mental vision exhaustless elements for
   the study of eternity;---into which the angels are still looking with
   holy, unsatiated curiosity. This is the crowning illustration of the
   scriptural usage of expressing things invisible by the things which are
   seen.

CHAPTER IX.

   Blood and Death of Christ---Blood, when applied to Christ, has a
   Meaning more comprehensive than its ordinary Import---It means Totality
   of Expiatory Sufferings---Christ really died---Death reached both his
   Natures---Scene at Patmos.

   THERE is yet another class of scriptural passages bearing upon the
   question under discussion, which requires a more deliberate
   consideration. The efficiency of the blood of Christ in the scheme of
   redemption is a cardinal doctrine of the New Testament. It asserts that
   we are washed in his blood; that we are cleansed by his blood; that we
   are made white by his blood ; that we are purged by his blood; that we
   are redeemed by his blood; that he bought us with his blood; that
   without the shedding of blood there could be no remission. So the death
   of Christ is plainly shadowed forth in the Old Testament, and forms the
   absorbing theme of the New. Now it is said that blood and death could
   not have been predicated of the ethereal essence of the Godhead; that
   God is a Spirit, without blood or corporeal substan , ce ; that God is
   an eternal Spirit, and necessarily incapable of dying. Hence it is
   confidently urged that the oft-repeated scriptural declarations,
   concerning the blood and death of our blessed Lord must have referred
   to the man Christ Jesus, and not to the indwelling God. The answers,
   the conclusive answers to these imposing objections, may be arranged
   under two heads.

   First. The incarnate God had blood. It was sweated forth at Gethsemane
   ; it was poured out on Calvary. But the Bible, in speaking of
   Christ's"s blood, gives to the term a meaning vastly more comprehensive
   than its ordinary signification. When our Lord, the same night in which
   he was betrayed, after supper, took the cup, and, having given thanks,
   gave it to his disciples, saying, "Drink ye all of it, for this is my
   blood of" the New Testament;" and when his disciples, in obedience to
   his command, drank of the cup, they did not actually drink of the blood
   then flowing warm in the veins of their - Master; the sacramental fluid
   of which they partook6l- was the " blood of the iNnew Testament;" that
   myvstical, viewless ocean of salvation provided, byv t@he whole
   expiatory sufferings of Christ, for " the healing of the nations." In
   thus expanding the term blood, when used to denote the blood of the
   Mediator between God and man, we place ourselves upon the authority of
   the dying declarations of the eternal Son. The expansion of the term,
   when applied to his own most precious blood,,, was dictated by his own
   unerring lips.-- Matthew, 26xxvi. 27, 28. So, when the New Testament
   declares that the redeemed of every age and nation are " washlied," and
   " cleansed," and " made white," and " purged" by the blood of Christ,
   it means not to use the term in its strict literal import, but in the
   same comprehensive sense in which our Saviour had himself used it at
   the institution of his holy eucharist.

   In this vast ocean of infinite grace, opened at the dawn of time, Abel,
   and Enoch, and Noah, and Abraham, and Lot were regenerated and
   sanctified, centuries before the vital element had begun to circulate
   through the arteries of the infant Jesus. In this same never ebbing
   ocean, boundless as the love of God, will all the countless myriads of
   the redeemed of all times, and tongues, "and -a climes continue to be
   "14 washed," and "cleansed," and "ii made white," and:;, "redeemed,"
   "until the mighty angel, standing with one foot on the sea and the
   other on the earth, and lifting his hand to heaven, shall swear by him
   that liveth forever and ever that there shall be time no longer.

   Christ is said, in Scripture, to have purchased us with his blood. But
   how small a part did the blood actually drawn from his veins, by the
   sweat of Gethsemane and the irons of Calvary, formra of the infinite
   price which he paid! The price, the infinite price of the purchase, was
   the whole stupendous aggregate of his humiliation and sufferings. The
   first great payment was made "when he exchanged his throne in heaven
   for the manger of Bethlehem. The payments were continued every day of
   his suffering life. From his birth to his death, he was " a man of
   sorrows, and acoequaindiiited with grief." He wander"ed" a@bout
   "houseless and friendless, hungry and athirst. He had not, like the
   foxes of the field, a hole to which he might retire; he had not, like
   the birds of the air, a nest wherein he might repose. He was hunted,
   "like a partridge in the mountains," until he found rest in the tomb of
   Joseph. Gethsemane had poured its copious and tearful contribution into
   the treasury "of justice, and the last installment of the mighty debt
   created by our sins was paid on Calvary.

   By the blood of Christ, then, the Oracles of Truth mean the totality of
   the merits of his expiatory sufferings. This explanation solves the
   seeming mystery of Paul's"s injunction, " Feed the Church of God, which
   he hath purchased with his own blood."---Acts, 20xx. 28. The
   proposition contained in the injunction was literally correct. God the
   Son, in very fact, purchased the Church with his own blood, according
   to the sublime meaning of the term, "as expounded by himself at his
   sacramental supper. The passage from Acts,. then, is clear proof that
   the divinity of Christ participated in his sufferings ; for had not his
   divinity participated, the sufferings with which he purchased his
   Church could not have been called the blood of God. He purchased his
   Church, ,not with the pains of the man alone, but with the humiliation
   and, agonies of the God, actual, and not merely construcuetive." Had
   the man only suffered, the stupendous proposition would not have been
   true, that God purchased the Church " with his own blood." The Bible
   deals little in detail. By one or two trumpet notes, it is wont to
   awaken trains of thought sufficient to fill uninspired volumes. Had it
   recounted all the variegated sufferings of Christ, corporeal and
   mental, human and divine, we would almost be led to suppose that,
   literally, "even the world itself could not contain the books that
   should be written."---John, 21xxi. 25. From the countless group of his
   agonies, the Bible has selected the palpable and startling incident of
   hisMs shed blood---an incident always appalling to humanity---as one
   well calculated deeply to impress on the imagination,. the memory, and
   the hearts of men the whole most pathetic tragedy of his vicarious
   sufferings, divine and human, commencing when he lLeft. the right hand
   of his@ Father, and ending not until, from the crwoss, he cried, "It is
   finished," and gave up the ghost.

   Secondly. The incarnate God could die. He did die. Without his
   life--giving death the Bible would be a dead letter, or, rather, " a
   consuming fire." The incarnate God, in his united natures, was born of
   woman, as the ordinary sons of humanity are born; he died in hiMs
   united natures, as the ordinary sons of humanity die. If t he Godhead
   of Christ is an eternal spirit, so is the" Soul of an ordinary man, as
   to the eternity to come. The human soul is as deathless as the ethereal
   essence of its Creator. The soul of an ordinary man does not cease to
   be at his death, any more than the ethereal essence of the Son of God
   ceased to be when he died in his united natures. There is nothing more
   startling in the idea, that the second person of the Trinityv really
   died in his united ,,.natures, than there is in the thought that he
   really became incarnate and was born into our world.

   But we rest our position, that the second person of the Trinity really
   died in his united natures, upon authority as much above the dogmas of
   human reason as the heavens are higher than the earth. After the
   resurrection of Christ, his lately crucified, but now risen and
   spiritualized body, accompanitied its divine occupant to his celestial
   home, bearing, no doubt, on its hands the print of the nails, and in
   its side the mark of the spear shown to the unbelieving Thomas. It was
   the second person of the Trinity, clothed in his now glorified vestment
   of flesh, who appeared to St. John when he was in the Spirit on the
   Lord's"s day, commencing with the thrilling declaration, "I am the
   first and the last; I am he that liveth and was dead, and, behold, I am
   alive forever more."---Revelation, 1 i. 17, 18. The same divine
   speaker, in the leleventh verse, had declared of himself, "I am Alpha
   and Omega, the first and the last." Who was he of whom the declaration
   was thus made that he had been dead? It was the same being who was
   alive again. And who was he that was thus alive? It was the God-man in
   his united natures. To give truth, then, to the divine declaration, it
   must have been the God-manian in his united natures, who had been dead.

   Nor is this all. The glorious apparition at Patmos, in declaring that
   he had been dead, di " id not intend merely to refer to the severance
   of the immaterial and material parts of his being. The Speaker was the
   Creator and the Ruler of the universe. When he said that he himself,
   his own, undivided, majestic self, had been dead, he did not mean to
   point alone to the visible extinction of his life on Calvary. He must
   rather have primarily intended to intimate to that beloved disciple,
   who had leaned on his bosom, as far as mortal ears could hear and live,
   those mysterious agonies, aptly termed death, which, as the incarnate
   substitute for sin, his divine spirit had endured from the overflowing
   deluge of infinite wrath. It would depreciate the majesty of the awful
   scene, to suppose that the divine personage meant to speak only of the
   severance, for three days, of his material and incorporeal natures.

   The declaration at Patmos was by the God of truth. It was, as it were,
   his official proclamation to the universe of a stupendous event, in
   which he had been himself the Actor. The declaration must have been the
   essence of ingenuous truth; true to the letter, true to the spirit of
   its unlimited terms in all their amplitude; without covert meaning or
   misleading innuendo. How do the sanctity and the plenitude of its awful
   verity overwhelm that theory of man which would make the God at Patmos,
   notwithstanding the unqualified universality of his words, intend
   nothing more than that his death had consisted in the meri-e
   dissolution of his frail garment of humanity, leaving unimpaired and
   untouched his own divine beatitude!

   There are other expressions, not yet the subject of comment, in this
   august passage, which seem to carry along with them intrinsic
   demonstration that the divine spirit of the redeeming, God had
   participated in the vicarious agonies denominated death in Scripture.
   Helie who spoke, and he who had been dead, and he who was alive again,
   was identical. The speaker applied to himself, in the three stages of
   his action---the speaking, the dying, and the resuscitated stage---the
   same personal pronoun. "I am he that liveth and was dead; and, behold,
   I am alive forever more." If the speaker was God, it follows that he
   who had been dead and was alive again was also God. That he who spoke
   was God, is self-evident from the fact that he appropriated to himself,
   perhaps, the loftiest attribute of the Godhead. He styled himself "the
   First," the, "Alpha." The Alpha, then, was he who spoke, and had been
   dead, and was alive again. The Alpha was the speaking God, the dying
   God, the living God of this everliving passage. To predicate all this
   of the human son of the Virgin would be impiety, were it not for
   innocency of intention. The human son of the Virgin was created out of
   nothing in the reign of Herod; he was not coeval with the uncreated
   Ancient of Days. Instead of being the principal personage of the
   passage, the human son of the Virgin was not named in it, or even made
   the subject of allusion. He was not thus named, or even made the
   subject of allusion, because he was only the guise, the vestment, the
   human veil covering the ineffable and shrouded glories of the speaking
   God, the dying God, the everliving God of the first chapter of
   Revelation.

   , But reason here interposes her speculations and her objections. She
   deems that the declarations of the God at Patmos, if literally
   understood, would * come into collision with his attributes ; that he
   had not capacity to suffer in his united natures ; that if he had the
   capacity, it was not ",fitting to God" thus to suffer; that the
   declarations of the God at Patmos are too high, too vast, too
   incomprehensible and stupendous to be entitled to full credence,
   according to the plain import of the terms. We would respectfully
   invite the authors of these suggestions to turn their eyes to the
   eighth and ninth verses of the fifty-fifth chapter of Isaiah. " For my
   thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith
   the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
   higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts."

   The revealed "ways" and "thoughts" of God are not only beyond, but
   sometimes seemingly opposed to reason. To yield them implicit, credence
   often requires a flight of sublime faith not of-@,!pf easy attainment.
   Yet Abraham, the father o-0f the faithful, "staggered not at the
   promise of God through unbelief." Proud philosophy might have urged
   that the fulfilment of the promise involved a physical impossibility.
   Yet the faithful Abraham " believed God, and it was counted to him for
   righteousness."---Romans, 4iv. 3, 20. Our argument asks nothing but
   belief in the declarations of the living God. It seeks not to sustain
   the doctrine that the divinity of Christ participated in - his
   expiatory sufferings by the frail props of human reasoning. It fixes
   its great doctrine on the adamantine foundation. , that , "the mouth of
   the Lord hath spoken it."-- Isaiah, 1i. 20. The doctrine developed may,
   indeed, be too lofty for mortal comprehension. It may be opposed to
   what reason deems " fitting to God." It may come into imagined
   collision with the attributes of the Deity. It should, nevertheless, be
   enough to convince, at least to silence unbelief, that ,the mouth of
   the Lord hath spoken it."

   Let not human reason, in the garb of the prevalent theory, affirm that,
   by the declaration at Patmos, "I am the first and the last; I am he
   that liveth and was dead; and behold I am alive for evermore," the
   august Speaker meant to be understood that the man had been dead in
   reality, and the God dead by construction. What right has a worm of
   -the dust to limit -the unlimited and illimitable declaration of him
   whose voice was "as the sound of many waters?"

   The First and the Last had indeed been wrapped in the mantle of
   humanity. That mantle, however, formed but the incarnate covering of
   the Alpha of beings. It was not the mere rending of that mantle, so
   gloriously restored on the third day, which constituted the death of
   the Alpha in the full amplitude of the awful truth announced at Patmos.
   The proclamation that the Alpha had been dead and was alive again, was
   there uttered by the First and the Last without restriction or
   qualification. True it was predicated of the incarnate Alpha; but it
   was predicated of him in both the elements which constituted his
   mediatorial personality. The whole undivided and indivisible incarnate
   Alpha, then living, and speaking, and palpable to sight, had indeed
   been dead, in a sense infinitely surpassing the three days severance of
   his material and incorporeal being. Had you, pious reader, unshackled
   by the domination of the prevalent theory, have stood where John stood,
   and fallen prostrate where John fell prostrate, and beheld what John
   beheld, and listened to the words which sounded in the astounded ears
   of the beloved disciple -would you have ventured, in that stupendous
   presence, to sink the majesty of the proclamation by restrictions, and
   qualifications, and reasoning subtleties of which the mighty Speaker
   seemed wholly unconscious?

   It is, indeed, a Bible--taught inference that, in announcing himself
   the Alpha, the divine Speaker at Patmos must have referred to his
   Godhead. For it is recorded in scriptural history, that the redeeming
   man was formed out of nothing at the time of the blessed incarnation. -
   He was but an infant of days, and could not have been styled the Alpha
   of beings. The incommunicable name was limited by Inspiration itself to
   him who " inhabiteth eternity." But it is not a Bible-taught inference
   that, in ascribing death to himself, the divine Speaker at Patmos meant
   the death of his manhood alone. The declaration, in its terms, is
   general, reaching his entire personality and it finds no restriction or
   qualification elsewhere in Holy Writ. The whole letter and spirit of
   the Bible leave the declaration just as applicable to the redeeming God
   as to the redeeming man. Inspiration intimates no distinction between
   the divine and human natures of the incarnate Deity in the endurance of
   those expiatory sufferings to which Scripture has given the name of
   death.

   We are, therefore, authorized, and in duty bound, to construe the
   declaration at Patmos, that the divine Speaker had been dead, according
   to the natural and obvious meaning of its terms, and to apply it to his
   whole united being. The Bible contains nothing to interdict such
   construction. The construction is required by the elemental rudiments
   of speech. It is a self-evident truism that a part is not the whole. A
   declaration appropriate to the whole, and to the whole only, cannot be
   depressed capriciously to a part, without violating the principles of
   sound interpretation and impugning the laws of nature. The incarnate
   God at Patmos ascribed death to the infinitude of his whole united
   being. ",I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I -am alive for
   evermore." The pronouns "I" and "He" included the God as well as the
   man. To subtract the divinity by arbitrary construction, and sink the
   declaration of death to the mere finite atom of his humanity, would be
   doing violence to the plain and unqualified words of the speaking
   Deity. It is the Bible alone that can wrest from its natural, and
   obvious, and plain import, the unambiguous language of the Bible. Human
   reason cannot do it by the despotic Word of her own power.

   Nothing short of plenary scriptural proof that the divinity of Christ
   was constitutionally incapable of suffering, or some direct scriptural
   aver. ment that he in fact suffered in his manyihood alone, could limit
   to that manhood his unequivocal declaration at Patmos, ascribing death
   to his whole united being in both its natures. Had such scriptural
   proof or averment existed, the Bible then, acting as i"ts own
   interpreter, would, by its own paramount authority, have restricted
   within finite bounds its infinitely capacious declaration of death
   promulged to the beloved disciple. The contraction of the infinite to
   the finite, would in such case, have been by divine, not by human
   authority. But there is no such scriptural proof or averment. As then,
   the Bible has left us free to believe that the Alpha, revealed in
   flesh, had constitutional capacity to suffer and to die the death of
   expiation in both his united natures, and as he himself has assured us,
   if we will but receive his gracious words in their own natural,
   obvious, and ineffable import, that he did thus suffer and die, where
   is the theo&lt;)ry, of earth, though crowned with the venerable frost
   of centuries, that will perseveringly continue to impeach the official
   proclamation of the incarnate, the suffering, the dying, the risen, the
   everliving God !

   Let not offended reason then, cavil at our application of the term
   death, to the whole incarnate Alpha. In such application we but
   reiterate the unambiguous declaration of the First and the Last. The
   scriptural import of the startling term, when applied to the ethereal
   essence of the God clothed in humanity, will, in the progress of the
   ensuing chapter, become the theme of reverential and more ample
   inquiry. It will there, and elsewhere in our humble essay, clearly
   appear that the term, when predicated in Scripture of the deathless
   essence of the second person in the Trinity, has a meaning infinitely
   more lofty and profound than its ordinary secular signification.

CHAPTER X.

   Death of the Eternal Son---Scriptural Passages proving@ it---His
   Exaltation---What was meant by his Death---Not mrnere Physical
   Death---Why his Sufferings called Death---Visible Expiration on Cross,
   but Representative of his viewless Death--Physical Death and Spiritual
   Death.

   THE great apostle to the Gentiles declared, "When we were enemies, we
   were reconciled to God by the death of his Son."---Romans, 5v. 10. The
   two following passages are found in one of the epistles of the beloved
   disciple: " Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down
   his life for us."---l John, 3iii. 16. " In this was manifested the love
   of God towards us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the
   world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we
   loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
   propitiation for our sins."---l John, 4iv. 9, 10. We have presented
   these two passages from 1 John in the order in which they stand in the
   epistle, but shall, nevertheless, consider the last first.

   Who was the "propitiation for our sins?" He, was the "only begotten
   Son" of the Father ; he was the Son, whom the Father " sent" " into the
   world." It was not the human son of the Virgin. That, terrestrial
   son---that son by adoption---was not the "only begotten Son" of the
   Father. Nor was he begotten of the Father at all; the conception of the
   Virgin was by the power of the Holy Ghost.---Luke, 1i. 35. The human
   son of Mary was not " sent" " into the world ;" it was in the world
   that he was created "and born. " "The propitiation for our sins," then,
   was no less a being than the second person of the Trinity.

   How did the second person of the Trinity become "the propitiation for
   our sins ?" The beloved disciple himself informs us, in the first of
   the passages transcribed from his epistle. The second person of the
   Trinity became "the propitiation for our sins" when, clothed in flesh,
   "he laid down his life for us." The term "death," in the passage from
   Romans, means the same as the terms ",he laid down his" life for us,"
   in the passage from I John. In both passages the Sufferer is the same,
   though he is called "God" in one of the passages, and "his Son" in the
   other. Each passage plainly points to the second person of the Trinity,
   and each passage virtually declares that, made incarnate, he died for
   our redemption. Of the same import is the following passage: ",And the
   life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faithli of the Son of
   God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."--- Galatians, 2ii. 20. The
   terms "and gave himself for me" are synonymous with the term "death"
   and the terms "he laid down his life for us," found in the preceding
   passages. Nor is the following passage of less decisive bearing: " Who,
   being the brightness of his" (God's"s) " glory, and the express image
   of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when
   he had himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the
   majesty on high."---Hebrews, 1i. 3. We learn elsewhere in Scripture
   that the purging of our sins was effected by the blood of God.---Acts,
   20xx. 28.

   A passage that we have already partly transcribed in another connexion
   is too important in its influence on the present point to be omitted
   here. " Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who,
   being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;
   but emptied himself, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was
   made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he
   humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
   cross. Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
   which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should
   bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the
   earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
   to the glory of God the Father."---Philippians, 2ii. 5-12. The reader
   will perceive that we have restored to this passage the terms " emptied
   himself," unjustly subtracted by the translators. Who was it that, "
   being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God?"
   It was certainly the second person of the Trinity. Who was it that "
   emptied himself" of the glory and beatitude of his Godhead? Beyond
   peradventure, the second person of the Trinity. Who was it that "took
   upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men?"
   Verily, the second person of the Trinity. Who was it that ",humbled
   himself?" Not the lowly son of the lowly Virgin. No earth-born creature
   would have ",humbled himself" by an everlasting alliance with his own
   kindred, in-dwelling God, to be consummated with a seat at the right
   hand of the Highest. Who was it that "became obedient unto death, even
   the death of the cross?" With no less certainty, it was still the
   second person of the Trinity. In each stage of the mighty action the
   second person of the Sacred Three was, in his own ethereal essence, the
   paramount Actor. He was as much the paramount Actor in the article of
   death as he was the paramount Actor in the article of incarnation. That
   theory which, down to the dying scene, would leave the God the Actor,
   and, at that trying moment, suddenly withdraw the God, and substitute
   the man alone, is surely "of the earth, earthy."

   The great mediatorial death is called in Scripture "the death of the
   cross,"---not that the divine essence, or even Christ's"s human soul,
   absorbed as it was in its overpowering reflections, felt the wood or
   the irons of the flesh-torturing tree. Material wood and iron have not
   power over the rapt spirit. If the expiatory death was but the "death
   of the cross" in the literal import of the words, then bodily pain was
   the sole price of redemption. Such literal construction would exclude
   Christ's spiritual agonies, divine and human, not caused byi-iot caused
   by wood or irons, and yet constituting the infinite element in the
   atoning sacrifice. The terms " the death of the cross," when applied by
   the Holy Ghost to the passion of the incarnate Deity, swell beyond
   their lexicographic meaning as far as the "distance from the manger
   cradle to the eternal throne. The lowly terms, when thus infinitely
   expanded, represent not only the pains, corporeal and mental, of
   Mary's"s human son, but the descent, and incarnation, and
   self-immolation of Him who said "Let there be light, and there was
   light."

   To evade the seemingly resistless force of the passage from
   Philippians, it has been contended that the exaltation of Christ,
   announced towards the end of the passage, was but the exaltation of his
   manhood alone; and that, as his divinity shared not in the exaltation,
   so his divinity participated not in the antecedent suffering. The
   celebrated commentator Whitby affirms that this was the doctrine of the
   fathers.* The school of Athanasius were wise in thus attempting to
   maintain their consistency. The component parts of their system would
   have been in chaotic hostility with each other, if, while they
   maintained that the humanity of Christ alone suffered, they had allowed
   that both his natures were the recipients of his exaltation. The
   exaltation was the reward of the suffering. The suffering and its
   reward were inseparable. The affirmation that the divinity of Christ
   shared in the exaltation would have drawn after it the affirmation that
   the divinity of Christ must have participated in the suffering. The
   doctrine that it was the man, and not the God, who was exalted, would
   appear, therefore, to be a necessary element of the prevalent theory.

   that the divinity of Christ must have

   participated in the suffering. The doctrine that it was the man, and @
   not the God, who was exalted, would appear, therefore, to be a
   necessary element of the prevalent theory.

   Yet this doctrine is not taught by the Bible. The very passage from
   Philippians announced that the subject of the exaltation was Christ
   Jesus; that the name at which every knee was to bow was the name of
   Jesus. Christ Jesus and Jesus are here synonymes, designating the same
   august Being. That august Being united the God and the man. The
   exaltation of Christ Jesus was the exaltation of both his natures. The
   exaltation of his manhood alone would have implied a severance of
   natures, made one and indivisible for eternity. The name at which every
   knee should bow comprehended the God. To the in-dwelling God belonged
   the infinite share of the homage of the universe. If the man could have
   been severed from the God, the man could not have been the object of
   heaven's"s worship. The cherubim and the seraphim would not have been
   taught to bow the knee to him. " Worshi@p God" is engraved on the
   pillars, and the walls, and the very pavements of heaven. It was the
   in-dwelling God that was to gather the bending knees around the name of
   Jesus.

   Let it not be said that the Creator of the worlds already stood at the
   very pinnacle of exaltation, and therefore lacked capacity to be
   exalted farther. This imputed incapacity of God the Son to be exalted
   is german to his alleged incapacity to suffer. Both incapacities are
   the creations of theoretic 12*138 r.XALrATION OF TRINITY.

   man. They pertain not to his divinity. That earnest prayer by the
   second person of the Trinity while incarnate on earth, "And now,
   Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had
   with thee before the world was," breathed forth its aspirations after
   that very exaltation with which he was greeted on his return to his
   native heavens.---John, 17xvii. 5.

   The imagination that the persons of the Godhead could not have been
   exalted by the consummation of the work of redemption, is but the
   microscopic view of human reason. The whole Godhead were ineffably
   exalted. The Son was exalted. The Holy Ghost was exalted. The ]Father
   was exalted. The very passage from Philippians announced that the
   confession of every tongue to the supremacy of Jesus Christ should be "
   to the glory of God the Father." " Glory to God in the highest," was
   the opening of the anthem of praise by the choir of angels who had
   descended on the plains of Bethlehem to celebrate the birth of the
   infant Messiah.---Luke, 2ii. 14. ",Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
   power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb
   forever," was the "new song" of heaven to magnify the riches of
   redeeming love.---Revelation, 5v. 9, 13.

   On the triumphal return of the second person of. the Trinity from his
   terrestrial pilgrimage, a new name was given him. He had borne in
   heaven the name of the Son. He had received on earth the appellation of
   the Christ. On his ascension, he was greeted at the gates of paradise
   as THE SAVIOURlt OF THE WORLD. This was doubtless the " name which is
   above every name." The appellation of Creator he had acquired by the
   word of his power. This new name was consecrated in the baptism of his
   blood. At this name, every knee in heaven delights to bow. At this
   name, every knee in hell shall be constrained to bow. At this name, it
   is passing strange that every knee on the redeemed earth does not
   joyously bow!

   But it is time that we should return from this unavoidable digression
   to the scriptural representation of the death of the uncreated Son. In
   this connexion, the following passage must not be omitted: " Even as
   the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to
   give his life a ransom for many."---Matthew, 20xx. 28. Who was the Son
   of man? He himself tells us in another of his evangelists, ",And no man
   hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the
   Son of man which is in heaven." ---John, 3iii. 13. This was the Son of
   man, who gave " his life a ransom for many." What life did he give as
   the priceless ",ransom ?" He gave that life " "which came down from
   heaven." He gave that life which fills immensity. He gave that life
   which lived at once in heaven and on the earth. If farther scriptural
   proof is needed that the second perilson of the Trinity made incarnate,
   died " to be the propitiation for our siniis," we invoke once more his
   own sublime proclamation to his beloved disciple 140at Patmos, " I am
   he that liveth, and was dead;-. and behold, I am alive for evermore,
   Amen."---Revelation, 1i. 18.

   It is, then, a recorded Bible representation, that the second person of
   the Trinity, clothed in flesh, died for our redemption. This
   representation, in every jot and tittle of its solemn import, must
   forever stand, though " heaven and earth pass away." That it is
   mysterious, and beyond the comprehension of human reason, is no ground
   for its rejection. If human reason can, at its discretion, discard
   every truth it does not understand, it might, by the word of its power,
   convert the universe into an infinite blank; for reasoning pride cannot
   comprehend even itself. It is enough that the death of the second
   person of the Trinity, to save our sinking world, is registered in the
   Word of God. From its sacred repository it must not be plucked by
   ruthless force ; nor must it be extracted by the chemical process of
   artificial interpretation.

   How are we to understand the declarations of Scripture, that the
   second, the incarnate person of the Trinity died for our redemption ?
   Human reason has its ready response. The prevalent theory would boldly
   affirm that he died in no other sense than by the severance of the
   material and immaterial parts of his manhood; that it was the redeeming
   man who was " wounded for our transgressions," and with whose " stripes
   we are healed;" that the redeeming God remained wrapped ,in the mantle
   of his impassibility ; that he continued as blessed on earth as he had
   ever been in heaven; that his infinite beatitude was as perfect in the
   most trying scene of the work of redemption as it had been in the
   crowning scene of the work of creation.

   With profound respect, yet with propounder solemnity, must we enter our
   humble protest against a theory which would impute to the reiterated
   declarations of the Word of God an illusory meaning. The Bible could no
   more equivocate than its divine Author could swerve from the truth. It
   is the very soul of ingenuous frankness. It has no covert meanings; no
   deceptive reservations. When it declared that the incarnate person of
   the Trinity had died, it intended what was fully equivalent to all that
   its words import; it meant not that he died by fiA Action of law; -it
   meant not that he died at e le in th e covering of his manhood alone;
   it meant not that he died merely in the death of that terrestrial worm
   which he had condescendingly taken into holy alliance with himself. The
   scriptural declarations of the death of the second person of the
   Trinity had a meaning real as the truth of God, high as heaven, deep as
   the foundations of the everlasting throne. They intended that hiMs
   eternal essence, clothed in flesh, participated in the dying agonies
   which wrought salvation.

   In this vital point, it is important that we should not be
   misunderstood. We will endeavour to define the position assumed by our
   argument so far as our finite and very limited capacity can grasp the
   mysteriousness and infinitude of the awful subject. It would be equally
   opposed to our head and to our heart to affirm that the Bible, in
   predi142 ETERNAL SON NEVER CEASED TO BE.

   ceating death of the uncreated Son of God, intended to intimate that
   there has ever been a moment, in the flight of eternal ages, when the
   seconi-id person of the Trinity ceased to be. According to Scripture,
   the death of a spirit causes no cessation of its vitality. The ethereal
   vigour even of the human soul is not palsied by the cold touch of
   physical, nor is it to be coniasumed by the fervent heat of spiritual
   death. When the second person of ,the

   Trinity " laid down his life for us" as "the propitiaration for our
   sins," he was as much the@ ever-livIting God as when he breathed the
   breath of life into the nostrils of our primeval ancestor.

   The second person of the Trinity atoned, by suffering in his ethereal
   essence, for the sins of the world. He suffered, perhaps, as much as
   the redeemed would, but for him, have aggregately suffered through an
   endless eternity. His expiatory agonies were, doubtless, beyond the
   conception of mortal man; probably beyond the comprehension of the
   highest archangel. T"rhey could not be bodied forth, with distinctness,
   in words to be found in any human vocabulary, nor, probably, in the
   vocabulary of heaven; yet spiritual things, inexpressible and
   incomprehensible, are often obscurely unveiled to the imagination of
   man by the revelation of God. So it is with the secrets of "that
   undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller returns." So it is
   with the propounder secrets of that pavilion of wo, where He who
   inspired Isaiah's"s harp " was wounded for our transgressions" and "
   bruised for our iniquities." Mindful of the imperfections of human
   speech, and the dimness of human conception, the Bible, to impar;?,rt
   to redeemed creatures some twilight glimpses of" the redeeming agonies
   of their Creator, has selected the most potent term known to the
   dwellers upon the earth; a term appalling to the imagination and
   affecting to the heart; a term rendered more expressive and impressive
   by its very obscurity and incomprehensiveness. That term is death ! the
   vague, shadowy, and awful name of the king of terrors.

   The Holy Ghost, who knows all things, well knew that this mighty term,
   and its no less mighty synonymes, were more calculated to intimate to
   mortal apprehension the viewless, nameless, inconceivable sufferings of
   the Redeemer of the world, than any other terms which humanman ears
   could hear and live. The name of the king of terrors must have been
   selected, not only for its transcendent potency, but for the affinity
   between the spiritual or second death which awaited the redeemed and
   the vicarious agonies borne for them by their ,great Redeemer.
   -Eternal, death awaited them. tl- -Death was the name of the penalty of
   their transgressrAnse4ions. Their Redeemer took on himself the penalty.
   The name wen@t along with it, as the shadow follows the substance. The
   term, death or either of its synonymes, then, when applied4-, iin
   Scripture to the second person of the Trintity, "meant not to intimate
   the cessation of his existence, even for a moment.

   It meant to shadow forth to the imagination, and impress on the heart,
   the image of those vicarious 144 ATONING DEATH BFGUN NOT ON CROSS.

   sufferings, equivalent, in the estimate of sovereign grace, to the
   eternal death of the redeemed, which the uncreated Son endured for
   their redemption.

   The Bible has given a mysterious prominence to the death of Christ,
   representing it as the vital element of the mediatorial sacrifice. We
   have seen that the blood of Christ, according to its scriptural import,
   means the totality of the merits of his expiatory sufferings. The body
   of @Christ has the same comprehensiveness of signi4@fication. When, at
   his sacramental -supper, our Lord distributed among his disciples the
   symbolical bread and wine, and called them his body and his blood, they
   typified and represented, not merely his physical body and blood, but
   the whole infinitude of his mediatorial merits. The death of Christ, in
   its scriptural import, has the same vast amplitude of signification. It
   was not confined to his - expiration on the cross. The
   media-heine4@torial death, which wrought the salvation @of t,ihe@
   world4, began when; the second person of the Trinity "emptied himself"
   of the glory and beatitude of his Godhead. It descended with him to the
   manger of Bethlehem. - It followed him to the workshop of Joseph. It
   clung with a vulture's"s grasp to the bosom of the houseless God,
   through his terrestrial pilgrimage. It included the totality of his
   expiatory humiliation and sufferings. Calvary witnessed its
   consummation, not its inception.

   To limit the redeeming death of the Bible to the visible expiration
   between the two thieves I would, by narrowing the extent and
   depreciating the value ATONING DEATH: WHAT. 145

   of the atoning offering, lower the awful standard of divine justice,
   and thus dim one of the brightest gems of the celestial diadem.
   Terrible indeed was the consummation of the atoning death. It was the
   outpouring of the full cup of God's"s wrath. Awful beyond what
   creatures on earth, or, probably, creatures in heaven, can express or
   conceive, was the concluding scene of the expiatory tragedy. We would
   not underrate its transcendent value. Without it, not a soul could have
   been saved. Without it, the smoke of the torment of the redeemed must
   have ascended up forever and ever. The tremendous consummation on
   Calvary, however, consisted not chiefly in the physical death of
   Christ.L "That was but its finite element. His physical deathl7. was"
   but the demolition of "the temple "of his body," "" that- it might be
   reared again more gloriously on the third day. The astonished centurion
   apprehended not that secret, yet almighty cause which darkened the sun,
   rent the rocks, and convulsed the earth.

   But the viewless recess, in which were -consummated, the sufferings of

   vision even byv the vague, and shadowy, and appalling figure of the
   king of terrors.

   That the term death, when applied to represent the expiatory
   sufferings, was satisfied by the physical expiration on Calvary, is a
   theory opposed to the letter and spirit of Scripture. There were
   sufferings behind the veil which shut out mortal vision, unseen and
   nameless. Those sufferings formed the true consummation of the
   mediatorial death of the Bible. Of that death of deaths; the visible
   extinction of l,,Iife on Calvary was but the shadow. The physical
   expiration on Calvary was the death of the redeeming man. The expiatory
   sufferings of the redeeming God, included, too, under the awful name of
   the king of terrors, and constituting the infinite portion of the
   redeeming sacrifice, were viewless---unseen by mortals, perhaps seen
   only by the Sacred Three. , . The "strong, yet seemingly unsatisfied
   desire of angels to look@A into them intimates that they were not open,
   palpa ble, and familiarx to the angelic vision.a;

   There is a physical death, and there is a spiritual death, sometimes
   called, in Scripture-, the second death. There is a death for mortals
   to die, and a death of which immortals are capable of dying. When
   Christ said, " If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death;" and
   again, when he sabid, "And whosoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall
   never die;" he did not -mean to exempt from physical death him who
   beliem e-ved in - iri him and kept his saying,-- John, 8viii, 51xi;
   11.. 26. @"He left physical death as he found it, the common
   inheritance of humanity. It was from spiritual death only that our Lord
   promised to protect those who yielded him their belief and their
   obedience. When Paul declared that Christ had "abolished death," he
   spoke only of the death of the redeemed soul.---2 Timothy, 1i. 10.

   It was, then, to save us, not from physical, but from spiritual death;
   not from the death of time, but from the death of eternity, that the
   second person of the Trinity, clothed in flesh, " laid down his life."
   All the redeemed of every nation, and clime, and age, were destined to
   the relentless grasp of this undying death. They owed it an amount
   which human arithmetic has not powers to compute. Payment to the
   uttermost farthing in the sufferings of the transgressors---sufferings
   as ceaseless as the flow of eternity---was to be exacted. Then
   appeared, as their Redeemer, the second person of the glorious Trinity,
   clothed in the weeds of humanity. He came not to cancel or to
   mi-nitigate their debts without rendering what the eternal Father might
   deem a full equivalent; for that would have been to make infinite
   justice weakly break its sword. His mediatorial mission had for its
   object the substitution of his sufferings for theirs. For their
   spiritual death was interposed what the Bible calls his own death. His
   sufferings had the same awful name which would have attached to their
   sufferings. Nothing short of this infinite sacrifice could have
   satisfied the high, and inflexible requisitions of infinite justice.
   The redeeming equivalent was death for death; the death of the God for
   the undying death of his redeemed.

   This was what was meant by the Holy Ghost, speaking by the tongue of
   his rapt apostle, when he said " that he" (Jesus), " by the grace of
   God, should taste of death for every man."---Hebrews, 2ii. 9. It was
   not the taste of physical death that was intended. Every man had drunk,
   or was to drink, of that bitter draught for himself. From the general
   doom pronounced on our first parents and their descendants, " Dust thou
   art, and unto dust shalt thou return," the flight of six thousand years
   has afforded but two exceptions.OD.S. Of physical death, the
   terrestrial son of Mary, from the laws of his human nature, must have
   tasted for himself in his own person, unless he had, like Enoch and
   Elijah, been miraculously translated. The redeeming death, then, to be
   tasted, was not physical death, but an equivalent for the undying
   deat@h to which the redeemed themselves stood exposed.

   What composed the cup of suffering, in Scripture denominated death, of
   which the eternal Son, clothed in flesh, tasted for every man, we know
   not distinctly, except that it was filled to its very brim with the
   wrath of almighty God against sin. The human son of the Virgin could no
   more, at least within the brief space of mortal life, have drank this
   cup than he could have quaffed an ocean of liquid fire. But the second
   person of the Trinity, in the omnipotence of hiMs might and the
   infinitude of his pitying grace, drained it, as the substitute of
   sinners, to its very dregs. It was a real, not a fictitious or seeming
   draining of the cup of divine wrath by the redeeming Son. No wonder
   that, at the unimaginable agonies of its Creator, the sun hid its face
   in darkness; that the rocks were rent asunder; that the earth shook to
   its foundations; that the repose of the dead was disturbed. This,
   doubtless, was the mystery of mysteries---new and "strange" in the
   history of the universe---which riveted the holy curiosity of
   heaven--.-into which "the angels desired to look." ---1 Peter, 1. 12.

CHAPTER XI.

   Second Chapter of Hebrews---Taster of Death---Captain of our
   Salvation-u---Taker on him the Seed of Abraham---Term Death when
   affirmed of the Eternal Son more fully explained---Both Natures of
   Christ Tempted.

   As the prevalent theory claims for one of its strong-holds the second
   chapter of Hebrews, we propose to review, somewhat in detail, the
   leading truths of that important chapter, so far as they bear on the
   question at issue. Whether their bearing favours or impugns the
   prevalent theory, our impartial readers will judge for themselves.

   The second chapter of Hebrews contains the declaration, that the
   incarnate God tasted death for every man. Was the tasting of death the
   act of his mere humanity, or the concurrent act of both his united
   natures ? The question is vital to our discussion. We suppose that this
   inspired chapter, while it shows that the manhood of Christ suffered
   aiand died, evinces also that his divinity participated in his
   suffering and death. It seems utterly to exclude the hypothesis that
   his divinity was shrouded in impassibility. The ninth verse reads thus;
   " But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the
   suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace
   of God should taste death for every man." The tenth verse reads thus;
   ",For it became Him for whom are all things and by whom are all things,
   in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their
   salvation perfect through sufferings." The mighty Being represented as
   "Him for whom are all things, and by whom are all thiffings," is
   unquestionably the infinite Father.

   The Taster of death for every man, in the ninth verse, is, in the tenth
   verse, styled the Captain of our salvation. The Taster of death and the
   Captain of our salvation are, therefore, identically one and the same.
   Who, then, was the Captain of our salvation ? Certainly the second
   person of the Trinity clothed in flesh. The human son of the Virgin was
   not the Captain; he was but the subalterm in the work of redemption..
   To suppose that the august personage of these passages tasted death in
   his human nature merely, and was the Captain of our salvation, not only
   in his human nature, but also in his divine, is a gratuitous
   assumption. The concurrence of both his natures was equally necessary
   in each of the departments. The assumption is worse than gratuitous; it
   is a fatal blow to the simplicity, the directness, the ingenuousness,
   the harmony of these two sister verses of Sacred Writ.

   The Captain of ourt salvation was made "perfect through sufferings."
   "The expressions last quoted were doubtless applied to the humanity of
   Christ. They were also applied to his divinity. As God, he was, indeed,
   infinitely perfect ere the worlds were formed. To pe"rfect him,
   however, for his new office of Mediator between God and man, it was, in
   the conclave of eternal wisdom, deemed fitting that the farther
   qualifications of incarnation and suffering should be superadded to the
   original infinitude of his perfections. Does any one cavil at the
   thought of making perfection more perfect! Let the skeptic, then, look
   at the incarnation, that schoolmaster from heaven, of whom reasoning
   pride should silently learn to wonder and adore. Even finite
   intelligence can perceive the aptitude of suffering, as well as of
   incarnation, to make perfect the divine Captain of our salvation. It
   was the suffering of the God which gave infinite value to his expiatory
   offering. It was by his own suffering that he best learned how to
   sympathize with suffering humanity. It was by his divine suffering that
   he taught the wondering hierarchies of heaven and the despairing
   princedoms of hell that he had become the Captain of our salvation, not
   in name only, but also in endurance; that his suffering and tasting of
   death were not figures of speech, but solemn realities.

   In the sixteenth verse, it is said of the Taster of death for every
   man, called, too, the Captain of our salvation, that "he took not on
   him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham." That
   the Taker on him of the seed of Abraham was the God, about to be made
   man, is beyond peradventuiare. HIle had been pre-existent,; hbe took on
   him the seed of Abraham of his own free choice. He might, had he so
   elected, have taken on him the nature of angels. While our opponents
   will doubtless admit that it was the God who took on him the seed of
   Abraham, and that it was the God-man who became the Captain of our
   salvation, except in the article of suffering, they will steadfastly
   affirm that, in the article of suffering and the tasting of death, the
   actor was not the Creator, but the creature. The intelligent reader
   cannot but perceive how subversive this theory is of the symmetry of
   the whole chapter. Nor must he undervalue this startling fact. Not only
   every chapter, but the entire volume of the Word of God, must needs be
   symmetrical. From its common and divine origin, each of its diversified
   parts must, of necessity, harmonize with the whole. Such are the laws
   of the material creations of God. Such, especially, must be the law of
   the moral creation, revealed in his own Holy Word, indited by ,his own
   Holy Spirit. No lawless comet wanders in that system of grace. The
   theory, then, which, to be sustained, must bring sacred texts into
   collision with each other, or with other sacred texts, cannot have come
   down from above.

   To evince more clearly the discrepancy infused by the prevalent theory
   into the second chapter of Hebrews, let us, for a moment, review its
   three prominent truths, in the reverse order to that in which theyv are
   recorded. Its three prominent truths arie the assumption of the seed of
   Abraham, the captainship of our salvation, and the suffering and
   tasting of death. In the assumption of the seed of Abraham, the God was
   the Actor. The man was passive; he was only the recipient. It was the
   incarnation of the God. The God "manifest in the flesh" became the
   Captain of our salvation; and here manhood began to act its humble
   part---the part of a secondary planet to the central sun, round which
   it is revolved. To the captainship of our salvation, suffering and
   death, of necessity, pertained. They were the chief purposes of the
   creation of the official character. It " behooved" the Captain of our
   salvation to suffer. Luke, 24xxiv. 46. To suffer and to die was the
   object for which the living God became the incarnate Captain of our
   salvation. The Captain of our salvation was to suffer and die in all
   the elements which constitute his being. He was to suffer in both his
   natures. He was to die the death of a mortal ; he was to die the death
   of an immortal. If he did not suffer and die in all the elements which
   formed his united being and constituted his identity, then the Captain
   of our salvation was never made "perfect through sufferings." The
   central sun would not be extinguished, or moved from its sphere by the
   mere dissolution or derangement of its attendant planet.

   On the prevalent theory, the Bible was mistaken in its asseveration
   that the Captain of our salvation suffered. The Bible supposed that the
   lightning of infinite wrath had pierced him through and through. The
   Bible was deceived; it was but the rent of his outer garmrment. The
   Captain of our salvation, in the paramount -and infiniteinfinfte
   element of his united being, passed scathless through the fiery deluge.
   It was only his subaltern, niaot himself, who suffered and tasted of
   death. The divine Captain remained cased in impassibility. If this be
   true, then He, who is the most disinterested of beings, would not have
   arrogated, or permitted his inspired disciples to arrogate for
   hiMmself, the honours hard earned by the suffering and death of his
   devoted subaltern. In the scriptural proclamations of the struggles and
   triumphs of redeeming love, it would somewhere have been announced, or,
   at least, intimated, that it was the self-sacrificed subaltern alone
   who, by his suffering and death, paid the price of the world's"s
   redemption.

   The second chapter of Hebrews came from the pen of its inspired writer
   a blessed family of harmonious truths. By the touch of the prevalent
   theory, its beautiful symmetry is marred. Its sacred sisters are made
   to use sacred words with double import, having a seeming and covert
   signification. This is not the ingenuous manner in which Divine Truth
   has been wont to deal with the children of men. In its application of
   the same, or the like terms, to the same identical subject, in the same
   holy chapter, it is a stranger to misleading duplicity of meaning.

   The fourteenth verse is, as follows: " Forasmuch, then, as the children
   are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of
   the same; -that through death he might destroy him that had the power
   of death, that is, the devil." He who, with " the children," "himself
   likewise took part of flesh and blood", was the second person of the
   glorious Trinity. The human" son of the Virgin took not part of flesh
   and blood by voluntary agency. He was the passive recipient. That the
   second person of the Trinity assumed not incarnation from any lack of
   capacity to suffer in his ethereal essence, if such had been hiMs holy
   will, has already appeared. But it was deemed fitting in the conclave
   of the Godhead that its second glorious person should accomplish his
   expiatory sacrifice, clothed in the fallen nature whose redemption he
   had assumed. Though he might have suffered of his own free volition
   without incarnation, yet he needed incarnation for suffering in the
   peculiar mode devised by infinite wisdom. The early prediction that the
   seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's"s head must have passed
   away unaccomplished, unless the redeeming God had assumed the woman's"s
   nature. " Forasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh and
   blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same." And " a body"
   was prepared for the descending Deity. Hebrews, 10x. 5. To the reasons
   which might have induced him to select the garb of humanity as hiMs
   suffering costume, we shall most reverentially return in a subsequent
   chapter.

   It was "through death" that the Son of God destroyed "him that - had
   the power of death." What then was this@ conquering death, through
   which the " power of darkness" was subdued, and a world redeemed? The
   inquiry touches the very core of our argument. It has mo@re than once
   been the subject of allusion in the progress of this, and the preceding
   chapters; its paramont importance seems to justify its expansion in the
   present connection. What then constituted the conquering death thus
   announced by the great apostle as the very pivot of salvation? Whitby,
   the distinguished commentator, limits it to the corporeal sufferings of
   our Lord. That we may not be thought to libel this learned adherent of
   the prevalent theory, we give his own words, recorded in his note to
   the thirty-eighth verse of the twenty-sixth chapter of St. Matthew. His
   concluding remarks on that passage are as follows:--

   "So that if we would speak according to the constant language of the
   Holy Ghost in Scripture, we must ascribe the work of our redemption to
   our Lord's suffering in the body for us; in which it is certain that he
   could suffer nothing answerable unto the punishment of damned spirits,
   but only, gave his life a ransom for many."

   Against such degoradation of that atoning sacrifice for which the
   Creator of the worlds left his celestial throne, we enter our
   respectful, yet solemn remonstrance. And in this remonstrance we are
   conscious that the general heart of Christendom, if left free from theq
   shackles of theory, would join, as it were by acclamation. Nor was it
   mere physical decease which constituted the conquering death announced
   by the apostle. Sufferings from physical decease consist in the pangs
   attending. the rupture between the dying body and its sis@ter spirit.
   Neither the agonies of his ethereal essence, nor the preternatural
   pains of his human soul, flowing directly from the hand of its heavenly
   Father, formed an integral part of Christ's physical death. Of that
   death the cross was the all-sufficient cause; in their sure work, its
   wood and its irons needed no unearthly aid. Had Christ died a mere
   physical death, his expiatory suffering would not have surpassed that
   of the penitent thief at his side. It was not the laying down of
   physical life, and that for three days only, which procured the
   salvation of the world.

   Of the great conquering death, the anguish of physical decease was only
   the covering pall. The life-giving death reigned within. Into its
   composition went, no doubt, the preternatural suffering of Christ's"s
   human soul : its efficacious, its absorbing, its infinite element was,
   however, the world redeeming agony of his ethereal substance. It
   derived the name of death from no uninspired vocabulary. Human lore
   would have deemed incongruous the application of the name to those
   supernatural throes and spasms which filled to overflowing the undying
   spirituality, ino, the undying spirituality, divine and human, of the
   incarnate God, but which formed not constituents in the process of his
   mere phyvsical decease. And in the dictionaries of secular learning the
   name would have been held just as inapplicable to the unearthly pangs
   of his mortal soul, as to the ineffable agonies of his ethereal
   essence..

   But the Bible has imparted to the term death, a meaning unknown to the
   dictioina4ries of secular lore. In scriptural phraseology it of)ten,
   indeed, denotes physical decease; perhaps oftener the undying misery of
   the undestructible spirit. Physical death entered not Eden ; no
   inanimate and cold and decaying cCorse was seen in its bowers. Yet the
   denunciation, "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
   die," came to the ecars of our primeval ancestor from the lips of
   immutable Truth.---Genesis, 2ii. 17. Nevertheless of

   "The fruit

   Of that forbidden tree,"

   He "plucked," he " eat:

   Earth felt the wound and nature from her seat,

   Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe,

   That all was lost."

   2@

   Still physical death appeared not in the garden of the Lord. The
   culprit, though driven from paradise, was allowed centuries of
   corporeal health after the " mortal taste." Yet the prediction was
   surely accomplished on the ve-ry day of the transgression. The
   denunciation, then, must have contemplated, not physical death, but
   cessation of moral vitality. Simultaneously with the transgression, the
   offender became "14 dead in trespasses and sins."---Ephesians, 2ii. 1.

   This was the first announcement of death in the Sacred Oracles; the
   last scriptural appearance of the name is in the eighth verse of the
   twenty-first chapter of Revelation. There it imports the " second
   death," of which the ruined and deathless soul is doubtless to be the
   chief recipient. It denotes the fearful consummation of that moral
   catastrophe which had its -inception when the sin-poisoned souls of the
   primeval pair died in the terrestrial paradise. So that, upon its first
   and last occurrence in Holy Writ, the name, instead of being used in
   its secular import, had but a secondary reference to physical decease.
   And in the intermediate pages of the Sacred Volume, the death of the
   deathless spirit, as well as physical death, is habitually included
   under the name of the king of terrors.

   In the vocabulary of the Bible death means penal su offering, corporeal
   and incorporeal, temporal and eternal. It is the appropriate scriptural
   name of penal suffering in all its infinite variety of modification. It
   shadows forth the penal suffering of lost souls, and, as we believe, of
   fallen angels. Once, in the history of the universe, has penal
   suffering devolved on spotless purity. To express the penal suffering
   borne by the Son of God, no new name was introduced into scriptural
   diction; none could have been formi-ned from the elements of human
   speech; none would have been intelligible to " ears .of flesh and
   blood." The ancient appellation of the king of terrors mysteriously
   expanded in its latent import for the tremendous exigency, was employed
   by Inspiration, dimly to intimate the whole penal suffering of the
   sinless Victim, corporeal and incorporeal, human and divine,
   vicariously endured for the sins of the redeemed.

   It was in this majestic sense of the mighty term, that the apostle,
   overflowing with the Holy Ghost, declared that the great Captain of our
   salvation " through death destroyed him that had the power of death."
   This was indeed the conquering death of the" Bible. This was the death
   of deaths, of which none but an incarnate God could die, compounded of
   the natural dissolution wrought by the wood and nails of the cross, and
   especially of those spiritual sufferings unknown to physical decease,
   which the holy Substitute for sin sustained in his divine as well as
   human nature, from the outpouring of the terrible cup of almighty
   wrath.

   This development illustrates more forcibly the truth stated in our last
   chapter, that the conquering death of the Bible was not limited to the
   brief space of expiration between the two thieves. Consisting, as it
   did, of penal sufferings vicariously borne, it commenced with their
   commencement, and ended not until their termination. The redeeming God
   began to die, in the scriptural sense of the term, when he left the
   right hand of his Father; for then began his penal sufferings. He
   continued dying until the close of the tragedy of redemption; for then,
   and not till then, were " finished" his penal sufferings. The brief
   death-struggle of mortals may occupy an hour or a day: the protracted
   death-agonies of the redeeming God filled almost one-third of what
   earth calls a century; progressing in intenseness from the hour of his
   humiliation until their tremendous consummation on Calvary.

   That the length and breadth and height and depth of the conquering
   death were but dimly perceptible to carnal vision, was in strict
   accordance with the scriptural manifestations of the God revealed in
   flesh. Almost from the first to the last of his terrestrial
   humiliation, the self "emptied" Deity was closely veiled under the
   weeds of humanity. The manger of Bethlehem disclosed but the birth of
   an humble babe; the cross of Calvary displayed but the expiration of an
   obscure and forsaken mortal. Yet nature could not always withhold her
   significant indications of a present God. The moving star pointed to
   Divinity just born into the flesh; the darkened sun, the rent rocks,
   the shuddering earth, fearfully betokened their suffering, writhing,
   dying Creator.

   It was a merciful provision in the economy of redeeming grace that the
   great Deliverer, when descending to our world on his benign errand,
   should have concealed his ineffable glory under the mantle of manhood.
   Had he appeared as he appeared at Sinai, who on earth could have
   endured his presence! Even Moses could not behold him face to face and
   live. Well was it for the oriental sages who came, heaven directed, to
   the manger--well was it for the apostolic band-well was it for the
   little children folded in the arms of the benignant Jesus-well was it
   for the beloved disciple leaning on the bosom of his Master-well was it
   for the mother of Bethlehem's"s babe when nursing the young Incarnate,
   or hoverini-ig around his cross for one last lingering look-that
   humanity had kindly interposed its protecting veil betwixt them and the
   consuming effulgence of -their redeeming God.

   The last verse of the second chapter of Hebrews reads thus: "For in
   that he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to -succour
   them that are tempted." This was do4oubtless applied to the man Christ
   Jesus. It was also applied to the God Christ Jesus. That the whole
   incarnate God was for a moment " tempted" " to pause in his mediatorial
   career by the near approach of his viewless, inexpressible,
   unimaginable sufferings, let the amazement, and agony, and bloody
   sweat, and piercing cries, and vehement supplications of Gethsemane
   bear witness. His peculiar aptitude, acquired from his own personal
   experience, to be. come the efficient and divine succourer of tempted
   suffering, in every place and in every age, has been tested by the
   lapse of eighteen centuries. Does any unbelieving Thomas doubt the
   infinitude of this consoling truth? Let him look back to the "
   tempted," yet triumphant martyrdoms of the early Church. Let him trace
   the modern footsteps of the "tempted," yet patient and enduring
   missionary of the cross, on the pestilential and burninzig sands of
   Africa's"s physical and moral desert. Let him strengthen his morbid
   faith by com.. muning with the voices that come up from the islands of
   the farthest seas.

   It is objected that the Deity cannot be tempted; and that, therefore,
   the temptations of Christ mustrnust be referred exclusively to his
   manhood. Proof that his divinity was tempted, is not necessary to the
   maintenance of our system. Temptation and suffering were subject to his
   own volition; and the God might have elected to endure suffering, and
   yet not have submitted himself to temptation. We believe, nevertheless,
   that Inspiration has applied temptation, as well as suffering, to both
   natures of Christ.

   Temptation was predicated of Jehovah ages before the holy incarnation.
   Take the following samples from the Old Testament. ", And Moses said
   unto them, why chide ye with me? Wherefore cdlo ye tempt the
   Lord?"---Exodus, 17xvii. 2. ",And he called the name of the place
   Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel,
   and because they tempted the Lord."---Exodus, 17.xvii. 7. " Because all
   those men which have seen my glory and my miracles, which I did in
   Egypt and in the wilderness, have tempted me now these ten
   times."---Numbers, 14xiv. 22. "Y Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God,
   as ye tempted him in Massah." ---Deuteronomy, 6vi. 16. " And they
   tempted God in their heart."---Psalms, 78lxxviii. 18. " Yet they
   tempted and provoked the Most High God."--" Psalms, 78lxxviii. 56. "
   When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work."---Psalms,
   95xcv. 9. " And tempted God in the desert."---Psalms, 106cvi. 14. "
   Yea, they that tempt God are even , delivered."---Malachi, 3iii. 15.

   The New Testament also distinctly predicates temptation of a person of
   the Godhead in passages where the name of Christ is not found. " How is
   it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the
   Lord."---Acts, 5v. 9. " Now therefore, why tempt ye God?"---Acts, 15xv.
   10. " When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty
   years."---HebrKews, 3iii. 9. So God is said to have tempted one of his
   -mcoist faithful servants. " And it came to pass after these things,
   that God did tempt Abraham."---Genesis, 22xxii. 1.

   St. James did not intend to place himself in collision with his
   inspired brethren of the Old and New Testaments, when he declared, "
   Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot
   be tempted of evil, neither tempteth he any man."---James, 1i. 13. The
   apostle, in the text and context has so qualified the terms here used
   to indicate temptation, as to impart to them a meaning different from
   that attached to terms nearly similar in the other scriptural passages
   to which we have just referred. In those other scriptural passages,
   temptation, in its application to the Deity, is synonymous with trial;
   to tempt signifies to try; to be tempted signifies to be tried. In the
   passage from St. James, the words indicative of temptation, qualified
   as they are by the inspired writer himself, imply, not abortive, but
   overcoming trials; the terms "tempted" and " tempteth" in the passage,
   mean successful enticements into sin. It is a self-evident truism that
   neither temptation, nor any of its derivatives, can, in this sense, be
   predicated of the omnipotent and holy God. He" may be tried, as he was
   tried by the wayward Israelites; he may try hiMs children as he did the
   father of the faithful. But he cannot -be beguiled into evil, neither
   beguileth he into evil any of his creatures. This solution, and this
   alone, brings the brioother of our Lord into harmony with his inspired
   predecessors and contemporariescotemporaries.

   That we have explained the passage from St. James, as its inspired
   author intended it should be 166 understood, is manifest from the
   controlling influence of the fourteenth and fifteenth verses of the
   same chapter. Nor do we stand alone in our exposition. McKnight, the
   stedfast adherent of the prevalent theory, and one of the ablest of
   scriptural critics, thus paraphrased the passage:

   "Let no man who is drawn into sin by the things which befall him, say,
   with the false teachers, Truly I am seduced byv God. For God is
   incapable of being seduced by evil; and he does not seduce anaiy one,
   either byv an outward or inward influence."

   ?,

   The temptations of Christ, unlike those indicated by St. James, were
   but abortive trials. Though he was " tempted," it was "44 yet without
   sin."--"Hebrews, 4iv. 15. The trials of the man Christ Jesuo.s were
   just as vain as the trials of the indwelling God. No element of his
   united being was ever touched by any incipient movement of forbidden
   desire. In the path of holiness, his human nature faltered no more than
   did his divine. His .temptations are applied by Inspiration to the
   whole undivided Messiah. Why should we seek to subtract his divinity ?
   If temptation was predicated of the infinite Spirit not revealed in
   flesh, why should it. be withdrawn from the eternal Word made man and
   dwelling among us ? There seems a peculiar fitness in the inspired
   ascription ocOf temptation to the incarnate, Deity. The meek endurance
   of trials formed-1 -.tfkls a prominent constituent in his humiliation."
   @ His Bet ,wvhol-e mournful sojourn on earth, from Bethlehem to
   Calvary, was distinguished by "himself as it he time of his "
   temptations."---Luke, 22xxii. 28. Human reason has no right to restrict
   to the manhood of Christ the unlimited declarations of Scripture,
   predicating temptation of his whole united being. His terrestrial
   pilgrimage was the hour of " the power of darkness."---Luke, 22xxii.
   53. Who on earth canll fathom that tremendous pPower, second onl y to
   the Omnipotent? When its profane but abortive temptations are ascribed
   by Inspiration to the whole incarnate Deity, will reason boldly seek to
   confine them to his human nature, because she deems temptation not "
   fittinilg to God?"

   Take, for example, the memn-iorable temptation of the desert. The
   arch-tempter had once unfurled the flag of defiance in the very capital
   of God's"s empire, challenging to combat Almightiness armed in the
   terrors of its wrath, surrounded by the faithful hierarchies of heaven.
   He faiiled; hfie fell. It seems not " passing strange," that, made
   reckless by despair, exasperated to phrenzy by the near consummation of
   long-promised salvation to the hated ",seed of the woman," he should
   have ventured to assail his great Conqueror, when he found him a
   solitary wanderer in the wilderness of Judea, arrayed ?in the vestments
   of frail mortality he was conscioH@us that he stood in the presence of
   the Son of God. He virtually named him the Son of God. The Holy One
   admitted, at least by implication, the truth of the appellation. It
   was,@, then, the second that bears "record in heaven," seen and
   recognized beneath the weeds of "the lonely pilgrim, on whom, as well
   as on the redeeming man, the prince of darkness made his aui-idacious
   assault.

   If the effort to tempt the in-dwelling GodJ. appears too bold and
   desperate even for the maddened fiend, no less so would seem his effort
   to tempt the chosen and guarded man in whom dwelt the never-sleeping
   Jehovah. Satan was a learned scholar; in prophetic lore he was deeply
   skilled; he had heard the song of the descended angels; he had seen the
   moving star; the voice so audible at Jordan' s waves, recognizing the
   beloved and just baptized Son, was still ringing in the ears of the
   fallen archangel; he could no more hope to sever the holy union
   developed in the manger cradle, than to rend asunder the Triple Throne.
   But the father of the wicked, like his children, was restless and
   reckless as " the troubled sea."

   If we pass onward in the mrnediatorial biography, we shall find that
   all the temptations of the High -Priests, and of the Scribes, and of
   the Pharisees, and of the Sadducees, and of the Herodians, and of the
   lawyers, and of the throng without a name, had for their subject the
   whole united being of Him, who cast out trembling devils, cured by his
   touch all manner of diseases, restored vitality to the dead by the word
   of his power, and commanded the obedience of the conscious elements. It
   was the whole undivided and undivisible Christ of the Bible---it was he
   who thought it not robbery to c@laimrn oneness with the infinite
   Father---it was he who assumed the august appellation of the Old
   Testament, I AM,---who meekly stooped, in the days of his humiliation,
   to the mocking trials of faithless men, urged onward by " the power of
   darkness."---Matthew, 16xvi. 1 ; 19xix. 3; 22xxii. 18, 35. Mark, 8viii.
   11" ; 10x. 2; 12xii. 15. Luke, 10x. 25; 11xi. 16; 20xx. 23. John,
   8viii. 6.

   Christ, in his humanity, "was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
   without sin."@Hebrews, 4iv. 15. How he was tempted in his divinity, if
   communicable to mortal apprehension, Scripture has not deemed fit to
   communicate. Nor would the communication have been of seeming use. The
   fortitude of the tempted man was revealed, in its outlines, as a model
   for our imitation; we @-could not have aspired to imitate the ineffable
   enduraiance of the deeply tried God. That his divine and human,
   temptations were dissimilar, in kind as well as in degree, may be
   inferred from a kindred dissimilarity in his divine and human
   sufferings. The body of the redeeming man was distorted and lacerated
   by the visible wood and irons of the cross; the essence of the
   redeeming Deity was pierced by the viewless sword of the Lord of Hosts.

   The supposition that the Word made flesh passed untried through, the
   ordeal of his humiliation, is opposed alikeq to "the letter and whole
   spirit of the Bible. If the Jehovah oDf the fO)ld Testament, "high and
   lifted up," was tempted by the wayward Israelites, how much more
   abounding and intense must have been the trials of the New Testament
   Jehovah, "emptied" and incarnate; rejected and traduced by those he
   came to save; betrayed by one of his chosen twelve, denied by another,
   and deserted by all; mocked, scourged, spitted upon,
   crucified,--crucified between two thieves! Nothing but the patience of
   a God could have withheld the thunderbolts of the tempted God.

   That the footsteps of the mediatorial God are often apparent in the
   second chapter of Hebrews will not be denied by our opponents. But they
   will affirm that the footsteps of the mediatorial man appear still
   oftener; and that, in the suffering and dying scenes, the man is the
   sole actor. This is a just specimen of the cardinal fault of the
   prevalent theory in its whole representation of the character of the
   Messiah. Ever and anon it presents the God apart; still oftener it
   presents the man apart. Its scenes are perpetually changing, sometimes
   in the twinkling of an eye, from the divinity to the manhood, and
   thence back again, as, P.@a suddenly, from the manhood to the
   divinityI.v NoIt so the scriptural representation. In the grand drama
   of the New Testament, whose author is God, and whose theme is
   salvation, the divinity and thelw manhood of the Mediator act
   throughout in concert. They are one and indivisible; separated, or
   capable of separation, in nothing. They / are born into the" world
   together; together are they wrapped in the stra-w of the manger. They
   suffer tog@ether: together they .die the scriptural death of expiation.

   Mary my love!! I started Here, I think you can still proof it, thanks
   alot!

   Death of Eternal Son continued--Acts, 3iii. 15: Ye "killed the Prince
   of life." I Corinthians, 2ii. 8: They "crucified the Lord of glory."
   John, 10x. 14, 15: "I am the good shepherd." "I lay down my life for
   the sheep"--The Lamb of the fifth chapter of Revelation--John, 3iii.
   16, 17; i " "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
   Son." "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world."
   Romans, 8viii. 32: "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him
   up for us all"--Father's"s love in death of Christ--Son's"s
   love--Self-denial of eternal Son.

   THERE -is a passage in Acts, and another in Corinthians, which are
   kindred passages with those upon which we have been commenting in the
   preceding chapters. The passage in Acts stands thus: ","But ye denied
   the Holy One, and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto
   you; and killed the Prince of life."---Acts, 3iii. 14, 15. The passage
   in Corinthians stands thus: "Which none of the princes of this world
   knew; for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of
   glory."---l Corinthians, 2ii. 8.

   Who was the "Prince of life," the "Lord of glory," of these, passages?
   Doubtless it was -not the mere humanity of. him of Nazareth. Beyond
   peradventure, he whom these passages denominated the "Prince of life,"
   the " Lord of glory," was the second person of the Trinity, arrayed in
   his vestment of flesh. We have, then, these additional declarations of
   the Holy Ghost, that the second person of the Trinity, thus arrayed,
   was crucified and killed. These declarations must have been
   accomplished in all the plenitude of their awful truth. Would they have
   been accomplished by the crucifixion and death of the mere humanity of
   the Virgin's"s child? A man is not perforated by the perforation of his
   vestment. That the ethereal essence of the second person of the Trinity
   was distorted by the wood, and lacerated by the irons of the cross, no
   one will be wild enough to intimate; but that his ethereal essence
   endured viewless sufferings denominated in Scripture death, inflicted
   by the invisible sword of the Lord of Hosts, of which the visible
   dissolution of his terrestrial being on Calvary was but the
   representative, we cannot doubt, with the declarations of the Holy
   Ghost to that effect sounding in our ears.

   The Sacred Three have, "at sundry times and in divers manners,"
   declared, without restriction or limitation, that their second glorious
   person, clothed in flesh, suffered and died for the salvation of the
   world. Man, for whose sake this miracle of grace was wrought, yields
   not his credence to these stupendous declarations but with
   qualifications and exceptions, the creatures of his own reasoning
   pride, lowering their sublime truths, as it were, from heaven down to
   earth. What is the cause of this strange phenomenon ? It is caused by
   the sin of unbelief, that great moral ailment of our natures. This
   ailment lost us paradise. It withstood the personal miracles of the Son
   of God. That celestial Physician could cure, by the word of his power
   or the touch of his hand, the physical maladies of man; but to mitigate
   this moral malady, he was obliged to lay down his most precious life.
   And even in the soul renovated by his blood, the final victory of faith
   over the remnant of unbelief is its last triumph. The sin of skepticism
   is not peculiar to the scoffing infidel; it is the evil spirit which
   haunts the path even of the pious Christian. It often obtrudes its
   "miscreated front" into the closet, whither he has retired to commune
   with his Redeemer; it sometimes pursues him to the very altar of his
   God. Regenerated man, while in this wilderness of temptation, is, alas!
   but a believer in part. The time, however, is at hand when his feeble,
   trembling, hesitating faith will be swallowed up in glorious certainty.

   The following passage is specially relevant to the point in issue: "I
   am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine."-- John,
   10x. 14, "As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I
   lay down my life for the sheep."--" John, 10x. 15. The last verse will
   be considered first. The speaker, in this pPassage, was Christ. When he
   said, "As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father," he must,
   beyond doubt, have spoken of himself in, his united natures, and with
   special reference to his Godhead. It was only the omniscient Son who
   could know the Father, even as the Father knew him. "Canst thou by
   searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto
   perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than
   hell; what canst thou know?"--Job, 11xi. 7, 8. These sublime
   interrogatories were propounded to demonstrate to feeble man his utter
   incapacity to explore and comprehend the mysterious and awful elements
   of the unsearchable God. The manhood of Christ had no greater capacity,
   physical or intellectual, than an ordinary man ; it had no infinitude
   of comprehension; it admitted its want of prescience. The mighty
   speaker, then, who thus claimed community of omniscience with the
   Father, must have been the fellow of the Father's"s everlasting reign.

   "And I lay down my life for the sheep." The speaker had two lives, the
   human and the divine ; the drop and the ocean of vitality; distinct,
   yet united. If his meaning was that he would lay down the human drop,
   leaving the divine ocean untouched, then must he have made a sudden,
   abrupt, and strange transition, in one brief sentence, from the
   altitude of his united natures, where the sentence began, down to his
   mere exclusive humanity. There is nothing on the face of the passage to
   intimate that such sudden descent was intended. Such abrupt transition
   is not required or indicated by anything in the context. In a verse
   shortly succeeding, in the same chapter, are found the memorable words,
   "I and my Father are one." ---John, 10x. 30. The terms used by Christ,
   in the passage under review, were unlimited and illimitable. They
   import the laying down of both his lives. They are not satisfied with
   anything of the totality. To compress them within a small fractional
   part of that stupendous whole, is to straiten, and distort, and maim
   the terms. Why will reasoning man gratuitously crucify the living,
   palpable, speaking words of the crucified God? Because, as the needle
   is true to the pole, so does unbending man implicitly follow the
   guidance of that hypothesis which he has adopted for his polar star,
   "God is impassible." Yet has it been shown that this assumed polar
   star, though it has hung for centuries on the skirts of the horizon, is
   but an exhalation of the earth.

   He who laid down his "life for the sheep" designated himself by the
   name of the good shepherd. "I am the good shepherd." To whom was this
   endearing name applied? Not to the human son of Mary, but to the "Lord
   of glory." The human son of the Virgin was but the mansion of the good
   shepherd--the temple consecrated by the indwelling God. As, then, a man
   dieth not because his mansion is consumed ; as the God is not
   destroyed. by the destruction of the temple, so the life of the good
   shepherd would not have been laid down by the dissolution of his
   tabernacle of clay, according to the mighty meaning of the august
   speaker. His declarations, which so astonished the heavens, could have
   been satisfied only by laying down the divine life of the second person
   of the Trinity, in the scriptural import of the stupendous terms, as
   well as the life of the associated man.

   Christ did not leave the meaning of the term "life" as applicable to
   himself, to be inferred by reasoning process. Five chapters before that
   upon which we are commenting, he explicitly fixed its signification by
   his own paramount authority. "For as the Father hath life in himself,
   so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself."-- John, 5v. 26.
   The Father's"s own vitality was imparted to the Son. His was the life
   which came down from heaven. It was the life that had breathed vitality
   into created intelligences. When Christ, therefore, announced the
   laying down his life, he meant not merely the human drop. He included
   the divine ocean of being.

   According to Christ's"s own explication of the term life, when applied
   to himself, the life of the incarnate Son was as the life of the
   Father. This authoritative explication of the term, when so applied,
   became a governing precedent for all future cases. Christ, then, in
   using the same term, with the same application to himself, five
   chapters afterward, intended, doubtless, to abide by his own
   explication and precedent. Hence we justly infer, that when he
   declared, "and I lay down my life for the sheep," he meant that the
   life which he was about to lay down was as the life of the infinite
   Father. It was the life, the whole united life of the incarnate God.
   The advocates of the prevalent theory cannot escape this conclusion,
   unless they are prepared to allege that the Son of God applied the term
   life to himself in one sense in the fifth chapter of John, and in a
   totally different sense in the tenth chapter of the same evangelist.
   But such discrepancy of meaning, in the use of a term solemnly defined
   by himself, and declarative of his own vitality, could scarcely have
   proceeded from the lips of the incarnate Word; at least, such
   discrepancy is not to be inferred without some scriptural intimation of
   its existence. No such intimation is to be found in the Volume of
   Inspiration.

   The incarnate God laid down his ethereal life, not, indeed, by its
   cessation even for a moment, but by sustaining, in his divine essence,
   the expiatory agonies substituted for the spiritual or second death
   that awaited the redeemed. Thile expiatory agonies assumed, therefore,
   the awful name of the penalty for which they were substituted.
   Inspiration aptly termed those sufferings death. The appellation
   commends itself to the children of men by its manifest appropriateness.

   In the passage cconcerning the coming immolation of the Shepherd God,
   the pronouns "I" and "my" hold conspicuous places. The personal
   pronoun, "I" is thrice repeated to denote the second person of the
   Trinity, clothed in flesh. "I am the good shepherd." "As the Father
   knoweth me, even so know I the Father, and I lay down My life for the
   sheep." Mark well the mighty terms, "my life." Thus applied, the little
   pronoun "my" acquired a meaning high as heaven and vast as the
   universe. It gave such exaltation to its adjunct noun as to grasp the
   life which "inhabiteth eternity." " No person is wont to employ the
   name of a whole to denote one of its minute parts. Should historian or
   geographer apply the peculiar name of a continent to designate its
   smallest kingdom, he would speak in language unintelligible and
   misleading. The terms "my life," according to their obvious and plain
   import, intended the whole united life of the divine speaker. If he
   meant merely the little spark of his mortal vitality, he must, in this
   case, have departed from that simplicity and perspicuity which formed
   so distinguishing a characteristic of him who spake as never man spake.
   To narrow down the terms to the mere mortal life of Mary's"s son would
   be imparting to this stupendous passage--we speak it witlh
   reverence--an illusory meaning. It would make the passage, though
   infinite in seeming and profession, finite only in its real purpose;
   finite only in its fulfilment.

   The Lamb of the fifth chapter of Revelation was certainly Christ. That
   Lamb had been slain. That glorious Lamb of God had two natures, the
   human and the divine. And had he, indeed, been slain but in one of
   them, and that, too, his inferior nature? The scene of this sublime
   chapter was laid in the celestial court. The Lamb, having just taken
   from the right hand of him who sat upon the throne the sealted book,
   had opened its seals, when straightway there ascended a "new song" of
   praise and thanksgiving, perhaps louder and more heartfelt than even
   heaven had been wont to hear, beginning around the throne of the
   Highest, and echoed back by "every creature which is in heaven, and on
   the earth, and under the earth!" For whom did this unwonted shout
   ascend? It was raised to theo glory of the lamb? And why? Because he
   had been slain for the redemption of the saints. That was the reason
   specially assigned. And would the mere slaying of his human nature, the
   mere extinction of his mortal life, have been thus assigned by the
   hierarchies of heaven as a special reason for raising higher than,
   perhaps, it had ever been raised before, the pealing anthem of the
   universe!--Revelation, 5v. 7--14.

   Christ, while on earth, said, "For God so loved the world, that he gave
   his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the
   world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be
   saved."---John, 3iii. 16, 17. And the Holy Spirit, by the lips of one
   of his inspired apostles, says still more expressively, "He" (meaning
   God) "that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
   shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"--" Romans,
   8viii. 32.

   That the Being designated in these passages by the name of God was the
   first person of the Trinity will not be questioned. "And the Word was
   made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as
   of the only begotten of the Father."--John, 1i. 14. Who was "the
   only-begotten of the Father," "sent" "into the world," and "spared
   not," styled, in one of the passages forming the last paragraph,
   God's"s "own Son," by way of distinction and pre-eminence, and in the
   other "his only-begotten Son?" Clearly, he was not the human son of the
   Virgin. Mary's"s human offspring was not the "only-begotten Son" of the
   infinite Father. Nor did the infinite Father beget him. The conception
   of the Virgin was by the power of the Holy Ghost--Luke, 1i. 35.

   In the thirteenth verse of the same third chapter of John, it is
   declared that the Son of the Father, there called the Son of man, "came
   down from heaven." And in one of the transcribed passages, it is
   stated, as we have seen, that he was "sent" "into thhe world." But the
   human son of the Virgin never "came down from heaven," at least before
   his ascension. Nor was he "sent", "into the world." It was in the world
   that he was created. It was in the manger of Bethlehem that he first
   came into being. He had no antecedent existence.

   It is demonstrated, then, that God's"s "own Son," his "only-begotten
   Son," his Son who "came" down from heaven," his Son "sent" "into the
   world," and "spared not," was none other than the second person of the
   Trinity. It was not the mortal progeny of Mary--earth-born and
   earth-composed in the elements of his humanity--that formed the glowing
   theme of the Holy Ghost in these stupendous passages. He spoke of his
   fellow God as the unspared Son of the Father. The unspared Son was he
   by whom the Father created, the worlds, the hierarchies of heaven, the
   dwellers upon earth. The unspared Son was the Son who had sat at his
   Father's"s right hand, and shared in his councils from the earliest
   eternity.

   For what purpose did the infinite Father send into the world "his own,"
   "his only-begotten Son?" It was not that he might explore this remote
   province of his Father's"s boundless empire. It was not that he might
   make a pleasant sojourn on this goodly earth. The Son of God was sent
   into the world to suffer. Suffering was the object, the great object of
   his mission. He came, not to impart dignity and value to the human
   sufferings of his earthly associate, but to suffer himself; to suffer,
   not by proxy or substitute, but in his own divine person. Infinite
   wisdom, indeed, thought it best that he should suffer in the fallen
   nature he came to redeem. But that was only the garb in which he
   appeared. His manhood was but the adjunct; his divinity was the
   principal. He came to suffer, not in his adjunct nature only, but also
   in his principal nature. He came to make, not a seeming and illusory,
   but a real atonement for the sins of man. That venerated common law,
   which our fathers brought from our fatherland with their language,
   their liberties, and their religion, is encumbered with many fictions,
   which, for the supposed furtherance of justice, it regards as truths.
   The divine law deals not in fiction. In its administration of universal
   justice, in its penal code, in its punishment of incorrigible sinners,
   in its pardons to the penitent, all is reality. Its celestial city for
   the abode of the blessed is no fiction. Its great and everlasting
   prison-house is no fiction. In the passion of Christ there was nothing
   of fiction.

   The passage transcribed froim Romans contains terms not surpassed in
   awful import by any words written in any of the tongues of earth. God
   "spared not his own Son!" The infinite Father "spared not" his own
   infinite Son! We have seen that the unspared victim was the second
   person of the Trinity. One of the Sacred Three would not have termed
   his kindred God the unspared of the Father, had he carried along with
   him his divine beatitude, in all its infinite perfection, from the
   throne of heaven to the manger of Bethlehem, and from the manger of
   Bethlehem to the tomb of Joseph. Had the throes and spasms by which
   salvation was earned, touched not the ethereal essence of the incarnate
   God ; had his divinity continuned as blissful on earth as it had ever
   been in heaven; had the expiatory agonies devolved exclusively on his
   terrestrial adjunct, the uncreated, the eternal Son would have been the
   spared, and not the unspared of his Father. It would have been only the
   human son of Mary whom the infinite Father "spared not." Yet the
   declaration that the devoted victim was "spared not," rendered, by the
   very simplicity of its terms, lucid as thhe sunbeam, is applied by the
   Holy Ghost directly to the Father's"s "own Son ;" and, by necessary
   inference, to his "only-begotten Son;" to his Son "who came down from
   heaven;" to his Son who was "sent" "into the world."

   It was when the infinite Father inflicted on the divine spirit of "his
   own," "his only-begotten Son," made a voluntary curse for those he came
   to save, "the fiercerieness and wrath of almighty God," that the
   tremendous declaratioon of the Holy Ghost was accomplished. The Father
   "spared not his own Son." True, that Son had been the fellow of his
   everlasting reign, with whom he had taken "sweet counsel" ere time was
   known, yet the Father spared him not. True, the paternal heart yearned
   with throes, to which the silent, though deep emotions of the faithful
   Abraham were but as the finite to the infinite, yet the Father "spared
   not his own Son." True, the angelic hosts, if permitted to behold the
   appalling spectacle, must have cast their dismayed, their deprecatory,
   their beseeching eyes now on the descending arm, now on the stern,
   though still benignant face of the Ancient of Days, yet the infinite
   Father spared not his own infinite Son. True, the uncomplaining, the
   submissive, the unoffending Son, "brought as a lamb to the slaughter,"
   presented, in his own meek and gentle form, an appeal to parental
   sympathy, almost enough to make even divine justice "break its sword,"
   yet the Father spared him not. This was indeed the magnanimity of a
   God! This "became Him for whom are all things, and by whom are all
   things!" It became the First who bears "record in heaven;" it became
   the august Ancient of Days; it became the infinite Father. This was the
   sublime mode, devised in the conclave of the Godhead, for "bringing
   many sons unto glory."--Hebrews, 2ii. 10. The sacrifice was not
   delusive; the Holy Trinity never delude. It was an awful reality, not
   an Oriental metaphor.

   The prevailing theory, that Christ suffered only in his humanity, must
   sink, as the stone sinks in the deep, under the overwhelming weight of
   the passage from Romans, unless its advocates can, by their
   interpretation, so amend that part of Holy Writ as to make it read
   thus: God spared not the human nature of his own Son! But at such an
   interpolation of the Word of God the devout advocates of the prevalent
   theory would themselves stand appalled.

   "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners
   Christ died for us."-- Romans, 5v. 8. The "God" of this passage was the
   eternal Father; it is "his love" displayed in the death of Christ, that
   is here commended to us. "God is love." The love of God is proclaimed
   by the visible creation; it glows in the sun ; it twinkles in every
   star; it is seen in "the green of the earth, and the blue of the
   skies;" it is heard in the song of the groves, and in the harmony of
   the heavens. But in the death of Christ, its dispersed and variegated
   rays are converged into one concentrated, luminous, melting point. The
   miracle of the Father's"s love displayed in the redeeming sacrifice,
   indeed "passeth knowledge." We can but study it, " as through a glass
   darkly" in the scriptural picture of that original, unique and
   incommunicable scene, the most magnificent, terrible., pathetic, and
   awfully mysterious that eternity has witnessed, where God the Father,
   the very personification of mercy, for our guilty sakes, "spared not"
   his own, his only-begotten, his well-beloved Son.

   Over the love of God manifested in the death of Christ, the prevalent
   theory has cast its eclipse, compounded of the vapors of earth. The
   bewildered eye now looks in vain for that prodigy of grace commended by
   the eternal Father as the masterpiece of his own infinite beneficence.
   The human son of the Virgin is made the only real victim for the
   sacrificial altar, while God's"s own Son is depicted as passing through
   the ordeal scathless, ever overflowing with the beatitude of his
   Father's"s right hand, impassive to all the throes and spasms, the
   sighs and groans, of his terrestrial, sinless, yet sin-bearing
   associate. From the scene of Christ's"s death, the prevalent theory has
   thus banished those astounding testimonials of the love of the infinite
   Father, which form so glowing a theme of the Sacred Volume! The
   scriptural immolation of God's"s own ethereal Son by the paternal arm
   sinks, in the theory, to the immolation of the human son of Mary!

   "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
   his friends."--John, 15xv. 13. The speaker in this passage was the
   second person of the Trinity clothed in humanity; his theme was the
   stupendous atonement by which he achieved the friendship and salvation
   of his enemies. To die for a friend is the acme of human love; to die
   for a foe, is beyond the aspiration of mortal mag-nanimity; the thought
   belongs to infinitude; it could have been conceived and executed only
   by a God; it was the mightiest movement of that uncreated Word, who
   spake, and material worlds sprung into being, and who breathed into the
   spirits of heaven their vitality, and holiness, and blessedness. The
   text constituting the subject of the last preceding comment, and that
   now under review, are sister passages; the former pointing to the love
   of the infinite Father, the latter to that of the infinite Son,
   displayed in the miracle of redemption. The Parent of the universe so
   loved our fallen race that, for their salvation, he awakened the sword
   of divine justice to smite his Other Self; his Other Self, moved by
   pity known only in the pavilion of the Godhead, freely bared his filial
   heart to the descending stroke, which naught but Omnipotence could have
   endured.

   It was by laying down his life for them that the eternal Word converted
   his perishing enemies into right redeemed friends. His descent from the
   right hand of the Father, and his holy incarnation would not have saved
   a soul. Had the cup passed from him, in accordance with his fervent but
   quickly revoked supplication at Gethsemane, redemption must have lost
   its glorious consummation. It was the last act in the tragedy of
   salvation which gave it its atoning efficacy. To that concluding act,
   the descent and incarnation of the second person of the Trinity, were,
   in all their wonders, but preparatory scenes. It was his penal
   suffering, vicariously borne, and termed death in the vocabulary of the
   Bible, that saved the world.

   It is true that the vicarious death of expiation, in the more
   comprehensive sense of the term, includes the whole process of
   salvation from its inception in heaven to its consummation on the
   cross. Nevertheless, in its primary sense, the term belongs more
   appropriately to the closing scene of the mighty drama. When viewed,
   however, through the microscopic glasses of the prevalent theory, the
   mental vision in vain searches in that closing scene for those
   demonstrations of the love of the eternal Son, which the Volume of
   Inspiration has taught it to expect. The theory abstracts from the
   dying agonies, the heaven-descended Martyr, and devolves them on the
   terrestrial victim alone. It may still point to the descent and
   incarnation of the uncreated Word as proofs of his love to the children
   of men, but it turns into figure of speech his laying down his life for
   though that stupendous and closing act is represented in Scripture as
   the crowning prodigy of his grace. In its display of ineffable and
   infinite love by the Son of God, the redeeming death of theoryeroy and
   the redeeming death of the Bible, are dissevered from each other as far
   as the the distance from the footstool of God to his throne. What gave
   its transcendent sublimity as well as its all-prevalent efficacy to the
   redeeming death of the Bible is the soul-thrilling, the heaven-amazing
   truth that it was consecrated and ennobled by the agonies of a God.

   "For even Christ pleased not himself." --Rom. 15xv. 3. "For ye know the
   grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your
   sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty was thus rich might
   be rich."---2 Corinthians, 8viii. 9. He who was thus rich and became
   poor for the salvation of the world, was not the mortal son of the
   Virgin, but the second person in the Trinity. Mary's"s human son was
   not rich before he became poor; he was born in want, his existence had
   its inception in the most abject poverty. It was the Proprietor of the
   universe who made his voluntary transit from wealth to penury. He who
   passed through this most wondrous change, was the same personification
   of pitying and almighty grace, "who being in the form of God, thought
   it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied himself and took upon
   him the form of a servant."--Philippians, 2ii. 6, 7.

   The self-denial of the second person of the Trinity is one of the most
   prominent and affecting truths of our holy religion. Self-denial is the
   voluntary sacrifice of one's"s own happiness for the happiness of
   others. Without some sacrifice of personal felicity, the virtue of
   self-denial cannot be developed. Where but in suffering was the self
   denial of the second person of the Trinity ? What privation did he
   undergo, if the sackcloth of incarnation was just as conducive to his
   blessedness as the robe of glory he had worn in heaven? What proofs of
   divine self-denial did Gethsemane or Calvary display, if the redeeming
   God carried with him into the garden and to the cross all the fulness
   of the bliss of his Father's"s right hand? Royalty has sometimes, of
   its own choice, abdicated the throne for the humble cottage; but when
   it transferred to the cottage the undiminished felicity of the throne,
   to what self-denial could royalty have laid claim? It had parted,
   indeed, with, "the pride, pomp and circumstance" of sovereignty --but
   without the loss of its felicity, it had in reality lost nothing. Even
   the stupendous transition of the eternal Word from "the form of God" to
   "the form of a servant" was, if it touched not his indwelling
   beatitude, but a modification of his outward state. Infinite happiness
   remained still infinitely happy; and had, therefore, sustained no real
   privation. The prevalent theory would thus transmute into metaphor the
   scriptural passages affirming the sublime self-denial of the second
   person of the Trinity.

CHAPTER XIII.

   Dismay and Perturbation of Christ before and during last Passion--His
   Apprehensions and Conduct contrasted with Human Martyrs, and Persons
   not Martyrs--Phenomenon not explicable on Supposition that Humanity
   alone suffered--Reasons commonly assigned for his Dismay and
   Perturbation, and FallacyFalacy of such Reasons.

   THE dismay with which Christ beheld his coming sufferings, and the
   perturbation which their endurance caused him, can be explained only on
   the supposition that the sufferings were not confined to his human
   nature. Had the primitive Christian martyrs exhibited the same dismay
   and perturbation at the approach of death, one of the chief arguments
   in favour of the truth of our holy religion would have been lost to the
   world. The patience, fortitude, and triumph with which they met and
   endured the excruciating agonies of martyrdom ranked high among the
   miracles by which early Christianity was propagated. " See how a
   Christian can die!" is an appeal to infidelity not of modern origin.
   Its thrilling- effect was well known and felt in the early Chuorch. The
   triumphant death of the first martyrs was among the most eloquent of
   the --addresses ever made by Christianity to the pagan world. It was a
   miracle, perhaps, more touchiiing to the heart than the healing of the
   sick or the raising,, of the dead.

   The corporeal sufferings of many of the early martyrs were, doubtless,
   greater than the corporeal sufferings of their Master. His was the
   case, so far as the body was concerned, of simple crucifixion. They
   were stoned to death with stones; they were consumed by slow fires;
   their flesh was torn off with red hot pincers; they were sawed asunder
   with saws; they were drawn to pieces by wild beasts; the cross was,
   indeed, often the instrument of their death, but to them was not
   allowed the comparative repose of simple crucifixion. Its abhorrence of
   the rising and hated sect of the Nazarenes had sharpened the devices of
   heathen cruelty; new discoveries were made in the art of tormenting;
   new and more agonizing positions of the suffering body were contrived ;
   the process of torture was rendered more slow, and the welcomed
   approach of death more lingering. To all this variety of agonies, the
   timid frailty of woman, as well as the bolder hardihood of man, was
   almost daily subjected. But nothing could disturb the patience, the
   fortitude, the serenity of the primitive martyrs. Whether belonging to
   the more robust or the more tender sex, they yielded not for a moment
   to the recoilings or misgivings of human frailty; they rejoiced in the
   midst of their dying spasms, and their last faltering accents whispered
   joy.

   The difference between these martyrs and their Master in meeting and
   enduring the agonies of a violent death is an historic fact not to be
   passed over unnoticed. It is not a point of literary curiosity alone;
   it deeply concerns our faith. It indicates that his suffering must have
   differed from theirs, not only in its degree, but in its very element.
   Contrast, for instance, the death of Stephen with that of his Lord;
   look at the face of the former, shining " as it had been the face of an
   angel," and then turn your melting eye to the " marred visage" of the
   latter ; listen to the joyous exclamation of the finite martyr, when he
   saw through the opening heavens the gloryy of God, and Jesus standing
   at the right hand of the Highest; and then lend your sympathizing ear
   to the wailing of Him who hung on the cross, and belief will ripen into
   conviction that, while the sufferer whose clothes were laid down at the
   feet of Saul sustained the pains of a man, the Sufferer on Calvary
   endured pangs pertaining only to infinitude.

   In farther proof of the correctness of this conclusion, let us direct
   our attention to the, enthusiastic exclamations of this same, Saul,
   baptized of the ,,Mtlze@ a@of Holy Ghost by the name of Paul,
   approaching his own martyrdom. " For," says he, " I am now ready to be
   offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good
   OA fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth
   there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
   righteous Judge shall give me at that day."---2 Timothy, 4iv. 6-8. And
   with these eloquent bursts of exulting faith pealing in our ears, -,
   ,let our souls kneel down beside our prostrate Lord, on the cold, hard,
   earth of Gethsemane, and become the astounded .auditors of his piteous
   cry, " , my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
   me."---Matthew, 26.xxvi. 39.

   Even without the sustaining power of religion, the resolved mind has
   often met and endured, without dismay, the utmost suffering of which
   humanity can be made the heir. The Roman Regulus returned of his own
   free choice to Carthage, though he well knew that, to the violent death
   which awaited him there, Punic cruelty and Punic cunning would superadd
   the severest tortures that history had ever suggested or fiction
   shadowed forth. And when the Africans had cut off his eyelids, and
   exposed his naked and lacerated eyes to their scorching sgands and
   burning sun until their patience was exhausted; when they had rolled
   about his naked person in a barrel filled with sharp spikes, pointed
   inward, to pierce and tear his quivering flesh, until tardy death came
   at last to his relief, they could no more disturb the fortitude of the
   hero than they could have shaken Atlas from its everlasting base. @ Yet
   was Regulus but a heathen patriot. Nor is g"the Western Indian chief,
   tied by his captors to a tree in his native forests, and encompassed
   round with dry materials, just lighted by the fires which are to
   consume him, less firm and "immoveable. The taunts of his tormentors
   and the searching flames, are alike impotent to disturb his serenity.
   Not a groan is uttered; not a sigh is breathed. The last, the only
   sound that escapes hilam is his shout of triumph.

   The dismay with which the Son of God anticipated his sufferings, and
   the perturbation which their endurance caused him, have been, for more
   than eighteen centuries, the wonder of Christendom. On this phenomenon
   the eyes of all beholders have been riveted by their own spontaneous
   and irrepressible reflections. For where is the man to be found with
   "soul so dead" that, with the full assurance of the "joy set before,"
   and the influences sustaining the man Christ Jesus---an assurance made
   doubly sure by successive miracles, by audible and repeated voices from
   heaven, by the upholding consciousness of in-dwelling
   Omnipotence---would not himself willingly endure all the human
   suffering of which the incarnate God could have been the recipient?
   Even for the bawble of an earthly crown, what privations, what toils,
   what scorching sands, what snow-capped he " ights, what ","most
   disastrous chances," what "hair-breadth scapes in the imminent, deadly
   breach," have not been joyously encountered! 1 Comparedl@U, then with a
   celestial diadem, a rank above the cherubim and the seraphim, a seat at
   the ri@ight hand of the Highest, made sure and everlasting by the
   guarantee of the Godhead, how slight and evanescent would seem all the
   ills that, in the brief span of a single life, could be poured into the
   cup of humanity, even if unceasingly filled to overflowing!

   But one solution can be given of the stran ge phenomenon of Christ's"s
   dismay and perturbation. His sufferings were not the, mere sufferings
   of humanity. They must have had their chief seat within the hitherto
   unapproachable pavilion of hiMs divinity. The brightest intellects,
   deeply schooled in the science of logic, and armed with the trea-sures
   of profane and sacred lore, have laboured for centuries to explain the
   mysterious indications on principles familiar to human nature. They
   have utterly failed; and the failure is a farther confirmation of the
   justness of our supposition, that the sufferings of Christ penetrated
   the sanctuary of his divine nature. A brief review of the causes to
   which human ingenuity has attributed the dismay and perturbation of the
   incarnate God, will best evince their utter insufficiency to produce
   the stupendous effects attributed to them.

   First. The advocates of the prevalent theory have assigned, as one
   cause of his dismay and pertubation, the new and more vivid views of
   the deformity of sin suddenly impressed on him at the time of his last
   passion ; representing that the almighty arm then lifted the covering
   pall from the hitherto disguised features of moral evil and presented
   them in all their native hideousness. This suggestion is sustained by
   the high authority of Bishop Bu I rnett. Doctor South, a preacher of
   the English church in the reign of Charles II., justly distinguished
   for his piety, learning, and eloquence, speaks ---of Christ's"s last
   passion in the following terms. He says:

   "What thought can reach or tongue express what our Saviour then felt
   within his own breast! The image of all the sins of the world, for
   which he was to suffer, then appeared clear, and lively, and express to
   his mind. All the vile and horrid circumstances of them stood (as it
   were) particularly ranged before his eyes, in all their dismal colours.
   He saw how much the honour of the great God was abused by them, and how
   many millions of poor souls they must inevitably have cast under the
   pressure of a wrath infinite and intolerable, should he not have turned
   the blow upon himself, the horror of which then filled and amazed his
   vast apprehensive soul; and those apprehensions could not but affect
   his tender heart, then brimfui of the highest zeal for God's"s glory
   and the most relenting compassion for the souls of men, till it
   fermented and boiled over with transport and agony, and even forced its
   way through all his body in those strange ebullitions of blood not to
   be paralleled by the sufferings of any person recorded in any history
   whatsoever."*

   * South's Sermons. vol iii pp. 348, 349

   We might dismiss this assigned cause of Christ'sCbrist"s dismay and
   perturbation with the passing remark, that it is nowhere intimated in
   the Bible; but other materials for its refutation, ample and
   conclusive, are at hand. The God Christ Jesus, before be left his
   heavenly home, had been fully conscious of the heinousness of sin. He
   was the being sinned against. He had come down from heaven to offer
   himself a sacrifice for sin. His omniscience could learn nothing new on
   earth of its frightful nature. The man Christ Jesus had been early
   taught the heinousness of sin by his own holy reflections. He hbad
   learned it from the audible discourses and the secret monitions of the
   indwelling God. And if he saw its heinousness more clearly at the time
   of his last passion, he must then also have felt more strongly the
   necessity of that atonement of which his humanity was the vehicle, to
   rescue from the pollution and penalty of sin the host of the redeemed.
   It is the extremity of his country's"s da;inger, forcibly presented to
   the mental vision of the patriot, that best sustains his exulting
   resolution to die in its behalf.

   There is no reason for supposing that a near view of sin, to which the
   beholder is himself a stranger, can disturb the felicity of a holy
   being. Gabriel has, doubtless, a sense of sin more vivid than humanity
   ever attained. And yet Gabriel, with his joyous harp, still stands "in
   the presence of God." The humanity of Christ is glorified and blissful
   in heaven. Its sense of sin acquired on earth, however clear, must have
   grown clearer in the light of eternity. Yet this sense of sin, in-
   stead of impairing its bliss, opens wider and more enrapturing views of
   the grace and glory of its kindred God, and swells louder its pealing
   anthem of praise and thanksgiving for his redeeming love.

   Secondly. It has been said that more affecting views of the countless
   multitudes who would reject his salvation, and of their consequent and
   eternal perdition, must have pressed upon the mind of Christ at the
   time of his last passion, and that these views enhanced the agonies of
   the garden and the cross. This cause of dismay and perturbation seems
   to be countenanced by Doctor South. It is sanctioned by the still
   higher name of Archbishop Secker, once primate of all England. But it
   is utterly destitute of scriptural authority. The God Christ Jesus
   kl@new, from the beginning, who would reject his proffered salvation.
   He always knew that he himself would one day pronounce their final doom
   with an unfaltering tongue and an unyielding heart.

   The man Christ Jesus had been early taught by the indwelling God that
   "strait is the gate and narrow the way which leads to life, and few
   there are who find it." And as the fate of the finally impenitent
   caught his pitying eye, he might well repose on the consoling
   reflection, that the Judge of -all the earth would do right. It is a
   blessed provision of the Father of mercies, that the sufferings of the
   incorrigibly wicked are not permitted to impair the felicity of holy
   beings. If this were not so, the songs of heaven might be saddened by
   the wailingo,s of the pit. If this were not so, the bliss of the
   sainted Abraham might have been disturbed, at least for the time, by
   the pathetic appeal of his luxurious and lost descendant for a drop of
   water to cool his burning tongue.

   Thirdly. It has been said that the agony which Christ foresaw with such
   dismay, and met with such perturbation, was caused, in a great measure,
   by the privation of the light of his FPather's"s countenance. If it
   were understood that this privation reached the God Christ Jesus, it
   would indeed go far to explain the mysteries of Gethsemane and of
   Calvary. But our opponents cannot for a moment admit that it was the
   divinity of Christ that was thus forsaken octf the Father; for that
   would at once concede that his divinity suffered; it would be giving up
   the point at issue between them and us. Upon the prevalent theory, the
   God Christ Jesus, in the garden and on the cross, beheld his Father's"s
   countenance lit up with the same benignant smile which had been wont to
   greet him in the courts of paradise.

   But even to the man Christ Jesus it was no slight privation that he
   underwent, though but for a few brief hours, the hidings of his
   Father'es face. The pious soul, accustomed to bask in the sunshine of
   heavenly love, experiences, from the sensation of its temporary loss,
   an anguish, of which the world cannot judge. But the sting of the
   suffering is the sufferer's"s consciousness that his own sins have
   interposed the cloud between him and heaven. David felt this calamity,
   and its terrible cause, rankling in the central recesses of his heart.

   Christ suffered, the "just for the unjust." He well knew his own
   spotless innocence. When his heavenly Father seemed to forsake him, he
   knew that it was for the sins of others, not for any demerits of his
   own. He doubted not that he was in the plain path of duty, however
   arduous and rugged. He knew that, if the light of his FPather's"s
   countenance was for a brief space withdrawn, it was only the temporary
   absence of a beloved friend, who was sure to love him the better for
   being absent. And yet his fortitude seemed about to forsake himn with
   his God! 1 An eclipse has no terrors to him who knows that it is caused
   only by the intervention of an opaque body between him and the central
   luminary, that is ever ready to shed on him anew its enlightening,
   warming, and cheering rays the moment the obstruction has passed away.
   Christ indeed suffered under a temporary eclipse of the light of his
   Father's"s face; but he well knew that it was the opaque body of
   others'" sins which alone caused the brief obstruction that a few short
   hours would remove forever.

   Besides his consciousness of perfect innocence, Christ had other
   supports never before or since known in the history of suffering. He
   knew that he must conquer in the struggle ; that the utinited Godhbead
   stood pledged for his triumph. To him victory was a matter, not of
   faith, but of knowledge. He knew, too, that the contest would be short;
   that he should speedily rise from the dead. He was conscious that the
   reward of his sufferings would be an everlasting crown ; that his place
   between the two thieves would be exchanged for the right hand of God;
   that hlie would leave the tomb of Joseph for the throne of heaven. He
   knew that he should " see of the travail of his soul," and " be
   satisfied;" that his blood would save fromui perdition countless
   millions of fallen immortals; that his sufferings would fill the
   kingdom of righteousness with the joyous sons and daughters of
   salvation, evermore raising the song of thanksgiving to him their
   Saviour King. It was a cherished axiom of ancient patriotism, that it
   was sweet to die for one's"s country. How much more self-sustaining the
   Godlike thought of dying for a world! This was the "joy set before
   him." For this he might well have " endured the cross, despising the
   shame." ---HebrewWs, x12ii. 2.

   Fourthly. The pouring out of the wrath of God against sin on the human
   soul of Christ, as the substitute for sinners, is assigned as another,
   and the principal cause of his dismay and perturbation. This outpouring
   on his human soul, and its loss of the light of the divine countenance,
   and its views of the heinousness of sin, and its sympathy in the fate
   of the finally impenitent, added to the corporeal pangs of Christ, are
   deemed, by the advocates of the prevalent theory, sufficient, when
   taken collectively, to explain the phenomena of his last passion. We
   admit, indeed, that the humanity of Christ participated in his
   sufferings to the extent of its very limited capacity. But besides the
   plain scriptural indications that his divinity also suffered, we lay it
   down as a principle, based on the inflexible laws of our nature, that
   the body and human soul of Christ had not physical capabilities to
   become the recipient of the amount of sufferings demonstrated by the
   dismay with which he beheld their approach, and the perturbation which
   their endurance caused him. Before, however, we enter into the
   development of this principle, it is necessary that we should review
   the indications of his dismay and perturbation a little more in detail
   than we have hitherto done. We shall then be, the better able to pursue
   the development of the principle. which we have laid down.

CHAPTER XIV.

   Calvary---Contrast between Christ and penitent
   Thief---Gethsemane---Speaker and Actor was Christ in both
   Natures---Sufferings there those of Anticipation---Indications of
   Dismay---

   It was the Anticipation of Spiritual, not Physical
   Agonies--Thrice-repeated Prayer---Appearance of Angel---" "My soul is
   exceeding sorrowful, even unto death"--What the dreaded Cup was.

   IF we cast our eyes towards Calvary, we behold there the incarnate God
   suspended on the cross, and by his side the penitent thief. From the
   latter, it is not intimated that any cry of distress arose. He was just
   tasting the bliss of sins forgiven. He was to be that day in paradise;
   and what cared he for the intervening moments of pain? Of the
   laceration of his quivering flesh his rapt spirit was no longer
   conscious. The present was lost in the glorious vision of the future.
   To him the cross was a bed of down. But from the incarnate God, though
   suffering no greater corporeal pains than the penitent thief, cries
   loud, plaintive, and repeated arose. He knew that he also was to be
   that day in paradise: but to him the beatitude of heaven seemed, for
   the moment, obscured by the agonies of earth. Over his drooping spirit
   the seraphic future appeared, for the time, to be lost in the
   present-the absorbing, the all-devouring present. What caused this
   mighty contrast between the indications of suffering displayed by the
   frail creature and the omnipotent Creator? But one solution can be
   found. The penitent thief bore the pains of a man ; Christ endured the
   agonies of a God. Had the sting of death been pointed at his humanity
   alone, the cross would have been anticipated with delight and met with
   triumph. The struggle on Calvary would have been hailed as the joyous
   termination of his vicarious privations and sufferings; the blissful
   hour of his deliverancem, nce from the heavy curse of others'" sins;
   the glorious epoch of his return to his Father's"s arms, crowned with
   the laurels of a world redeemed.

   But if we would gain deeper views of the dismay and perturbation of our
   Lord, let us meet him at the garden of Gethsemane. The occurrences of
   the garden, so far as they relate to our present purpose, are thus
   related by St. Matthew: " And he took with him Peter, and the two sons
   of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then saith hlie
   unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye
   here and watch with me. And he went a little farther, and fell on his
   face, and prayed, saying, my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
   pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt. And he
   cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto
   Peter, What! could ye not -watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that
   ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing, but the
   flesh is weak. He went

   ****** away again, the second time, and prayed, saying, my Father, if
   this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink of it, thy will be
   done. And he came and found them asleep again; for their eyes were
   heavy. And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
   time, saying the same words."---Matthew, 26xxvi. 37, and the verses
   following.

   The narrative of St. Mark is in the following words: " And he taketh
   with him Peter, and

   James, and

   John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy ; and saith
   unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death : tarry ye here
   and watch. And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground and
   prayed, that if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he
   said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this
   cup from me; nevertheless, not what I willill, but what thou wilt. And
   he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon,
   slteepest thou? couldst not thou watch one hour ? Watch ye and pray,
   lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh
   is weak. And again he went away, and prayed and spake the same words.
   And when he returned he found them asleep again (for their eyes were
   heavy) ; neither wist they what to answer him. And he cometh the third
   time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is
   enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of manrpau is betrayed into
   the hands of sinners."---. Mark, 14xiv. 33, and following verses.

   St. Luke adds the following essential particulars to the narration: "
   And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
   And beingo, in an agony, he prayed more earnestly ; and his sweat was
   as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground."---Luke,
   22xxii. 43, 44.

   We have thus transcribed, in connexion, the substance of the several
   evangelical accounts of the occurrences at Gethsemane, that the mind
   might take in at one view the stupendous whole. We cannot deem the
   garden forbidden ground. It is, indeed, a holy place. On entering it,
   we would lay aside the rough-soled sandals of controversy. We would
   even cast the shoes from our feet, as we tread the, soil bedewed by the
   tears and wet with the blood of the redeeming God. Yet was the
   affecting scene revealed for the edification of man. " The secret
   things belong unto the Lord our God; but those things which are
   revealed belong unto us, and to our children for ever." ---Deunt.
   29xxix. 29. " All scripture was given by di. vine inspiration, and is
   profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
   in righteousness."--@2 Timothy, 3iii. 16. Had not the garden scene been
   intended for human meditation, it would have found no place, in the
   Bible. The prevalent theory has locked up the sacred pages in which it
   is portrayed in seemingly inextricable mystery. To unlock those
   precious pages there is but one key. Our comments on this memorable
   scene will be arranged under several heads.

   ***** Fifthly. The thrice-repeated prayer of the garden ascended from
   the lips of that august Being who had thought it no robbery to be equal
   with God; it was pronounced by that almighty voice which had commanded
   the winds and the waves and they obeyed. With face prone on the cold@
   ground, and body quivering with nameless anguish, did the
   only-begotten, the uncreated, the divine, the incarnated Son utter the
   piercing cry, " my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
   me." To drink this very cup he had come into the world. Of this fearful
   cup he had often spoken. From his contemplation it had never been
   absent. Had the cup passed from him, the sole purpose of his
   incarnation would have been frustrated. The universe must have beheld
   the strange spectacle of a God attempting to redeem by his sufferings a
   ruined race, and failing in the attempt for want of fortitude to
   suffer.

   Yet, true it is, that, when the dismaying cup was just at hand, the
   resolution of the incarnate Deity seemed, for a moment, to falter. The
   piteous cry a-iscended, wafted upward byv more than earthly fervour.
   The cry, and its fervour, too, are engraved on the Bible's"s
   imperishable record, pointing with demonstrative certainty to the awful
   conclusion, that a single drop from that cup of almighty wrath must
   have scorched into annihilation the vital elements of the loftiest
   being ever created by the word of the Highest. That the infinite, the
   world-redeeming Son, in a moment superadded the pathetic qualification,
   " Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt," while it denotes the
   patient meekness of him who was " brought as a lamb to the slaughter" "
   derogates nothing from the tremendous character of that impending cup,
   of which none but a God could have drank.

   Sixthly. " And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven,
   strengthening him." To whom did the angel appear? It appeared " unto
   him." The pronoun "61 him"@" is twice used in the passage from Luke,
   and the context demonstrates that, in each instance, it was used to
   designate the Christ, the whole Christ. The angel then appeared, not
   merely to the human son of the Virgin, but unto the united being of the
   incarnate God. For what purpose , did the angel appea run unto him? The
   . r , t

   Holy Ghost has informed us. It was to strengthen him. There is no
   intimation that the angel appeared merely to strengthen the manhood of
   Christ. The declaration is general, pervading, according to its plain
   signification, every recess oOf the united natures of the God "66
   manifest in the flesh." The declaration would be cramped and maimed if
   withdrawn from the infinitude of his united being, to which it properly
   appertains, and compressed into the finite speck of his humanity. Can
   reasoning pride erect iitself into a court of review to expand, pride
   erect abridge, or qupalify,s by its own discretion, the explicit
   phraseology of the third person of the Trinity?,

   Perhaps reasoning pride ma;ky deem it strange and improbable, and
   therefore not to be believed, even the word of the Holy Ghost, that an
   angel should appear to strengthen the omnipotent God.

   ***** If reasoning pride is thus presumptuously arrogant, it may as
   well aim at consistence in its arrogance. Let it, then, if it dare,
   seek, by its rash skepticism," to blot out from scriptural theology the
   stupendous article of the incarnation. The incarnation was the wonder
   of wonders. That very God should become very flesh, and verily dwell
   among us, is surely not less strange than that an angel from heaven
   should appear unto the incarnate God, "strengthening hi@m."

   The manhood of the Virgin's"s son needed, ordinarily, no strengthening
   from above. Its Creator dwelt within; its guardian, its guide, its
   protector; almighty, never sleeping, ever ready to succour his frail
   terrestrial companion. To that humanity the indwelling Deity was
   wedded, and the marriage tie was to be lasting as the right-hand throne
   of the Eternal. Though a woman may forget her sucking child, " that she
   should not have compassion on the son of her womb," yet could not the
   incarnate and compassionate God fail to listen to every sigh, and count
   every tear, and remember, "as though they had been graven " upon the
   palms of his hands," all the weaknesses, and pains, and fears of that
   feeble humanity, which he had adopted as his own, and, as it were,
   incorporated into himself. While the strength of the incarnate Deity
   remained unimpaired, there was no need that there should appear unto
   the human son of the Virgin an angel from heaven, " strengthening him."

   It is true that the created angel had no strength of his own to impart
   to his Creator. But he bore greetings from the court of heaven. He was
   the ambassador of the holy Trinity, fraught with every soothing,
   "strengthening" consideration which could flow from the wisdom and love
   of the Godhead. It is true that the omnipresent and omniscient Father
   might doubtless have communicated directly with his omnipresent and
   omniscient Son. So he might with the prophets and patriarchs of the
   olden time. But the Father had been wont to communicate with the
   dwellers upon earth through the instrumentality of ministering spirits.
   That it seemed wisest to the infinitely wise that -,ain angel from
   heaven should bear the communication from above to the suffering God at
   Gethsemane, if it cannot satisfy, should at least silence the cavils of
   reasoning pride.

   The infinite Father,g from his exalted throne, beheld his
   only-begotten, his well-beloved Son struggling in the garden. He saw
   him " sorrowful even unto death;" he saw him "sore amazed;" he beheld
   him, being in an agony, "sweat as it were great drops of blood, falling
   down to the ground;" he heard his pathetic cry, ", my Father, if it be
   possible, let this cup pass from me;" he saw that even his infinite and
   omnipotent Son, now made a curse for sin, was almost ready to sink
   under its more than mountain weight: and it was therefore that ", there
   appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him."

   Seventhly. ", My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death." The
   true meaning of the original Greek words rendered by our translators
   p.212 "soul," becomes here a subject of interest. The divine speaker
   had a material and immaterial nature. Within his body were lodged a
   human soul, and that ethereal essence, which constituted the second
   person of the Trinity; the former bearing to the latter the same
   proportion as the finite bears to the infinite. The original word, here
   translated soul, when applied to ordinary men, means the immaterial,
   breathing, living principle within them. The term finds, within the
   common children of humanity, no other aliment. But if applied to
   subjects affording other aliment for its sustenance, then the term
   spontaneously expands itself, so as to embrace the whole indwelling
   immateriality, however vast it may be. Plato had received, through the
   channels of tradition, some few scattered rays of that divine light
   which, in early ages, had been communicated to man. These rays he
   carefully concentrated, and was thus enabled to form a theory which
   advanced one incipient step towards the glorious system of revealed
   truth. He darkly conceived the outlines of an immaterial, omnipresent,
   omniscient God, the creator and preserver of the heavens and the earth.
   To denote this ethereal essence, this immaterial, viewless, living
   principle, pervading and animating the immeasurable universe, the
   Athenian philosopher employed the identical Greek word with which the
   evangelists Matthew and Mark, have opened their narratives of the
   pathetic wailings of their Lord in the garden, and which has been
   rendered soul by our translators.

   SOUL EXCEEDING SORROWFUL. 213

   When Christ said at Gethsemane, "My soul isg exceeding sorrowful, even
   unto death," he must have intended to declare that his whole immaterial
   or spiritual nature was overwhelmed with sorrow. He intimated no
   distinction between the human and divine portions of his immaterial or
   spiritual being. He used a general term, applicable to both; a term not
   technically confined to the human soul; a term comprehensive enough to
   include his divine as well as his human immateriality; a term which the
   great master of the Greek tongue had employed to denote the divine
   essence. When, therefore, reasoning pride seeks to narrow down the term
   thus used by Christ, so as to confine its meaning to the inferior part
   of his immaterial or spiritual being, bearing a less proportion to the
   whole than a single grain of sand bears to the vast earth we inhabit,
   it seeks to render particular that awful declaration which the Son of
   God left general. To make the point clearer, let us suppose that the
   translators, instead of the present version, had translated the
   passages in question so as to make them conform, in terms, to the
   limited meaning now sought to be attached to them, by inserting the
   adjective human before the substantive soul. The exclamation of Christ
   would then have stood thus, "My human soul is exceeding sorrowful even
   unto death." This version would doubtless have been startling, even to
   the advocates of the prevalent theory. But if the adjective "human" is
   to be insinuated into the passages by construction, it might better
   have been openly inserted by the pen.

   214 THE DREADED CUP.

   What were the contents of the cup, whose mere anticipation caused the
   sorrow, and amazement, and agony of the garden, the human imagination
   has not powers to conceive. It was "the cup of trembling," " filled to
   overflowing with the "fierceness and wrath of almighty God." The
   visible agonies of Calvary doubtless bore no comparison to those which
   were unseen. The real tragedy was behind the curtain. There, impervious
   to human vision, was perfected the spiritual crucifixion of the eternal
   Son of God. The body of Christ heeded not the scourgings of the
   soldiery, but his whole immaterial being writhed under the anguish of
   those stripes by which we are healed. He looked down with indifference
   on the vindictive gaze of the crucifying multitude; but he looked
   upward with dismay at his Father's"s altered face. Through the opening
   skies he beheld that coun-, tenance, which, until he became a curse for
   us, had forever beamed on him with the sunshine of heaven, now darkened
   with a frown. The draught of mingled vinegar and gall he could reject;
   but now made sin, though sinless, he was" compelled to drain to the
   very dregs the terrible cup of infinite wrath. The nails of the cross,
   which lacerated his quivering flesh, he regarded not; but he, felt in
   all the elements of his spiritual natures, that invisible, yet flaming
   sword of the Lord of Hosts, which was piercing him through and through,
   as the substitute for sinners.

   VIEWS OF DOCTOR CHALMERS. 215

   But the scene was about to close. The last cry was ascending from the
   cross. "It is finished!" exclaimed the dying God, and gave up the
   ghost. "It is finished!" was echoed through the courts of heaven with
   triumphant acclamations. "It is finished!" was reverberated through the
   vaults of hell in tones of despair. What was finished? The throes and
   spasms of a suffering Deity were finished. The reconcilement of
   infinite justice and infinite mercy was finished. The everlasting
   triumph over the powers of darkness was finished. The redemption of a
   world was finished. We close this chapter by presenting to our readers
   the remarks of one of the master-spirits of the age on the extent and
   nature of Christ's"s sufferings. The remarks first reached our
   knowledge after these sheets were prepared for the press. The great and
   pious Chalmers says,

   "It blunts the gratitude of men when they think lightly of the
   sacrifice which God had to make when he gave up his Son unto the death;
   and, akin to this pernicious imagination, our gratitude is farther
   deadened and made dull when we think lightly of the death itself. This
   death was an equivalent for the punishment of guilty millions. In the
   account which is given of it, we behold all the symptoms of a deep and
   dreadful endurance-- of an agony which was shrunk from even by the Son
   of God, though he had all the strength of the divinity to uphold him--
   of a conflict, and a terror, and a pain, under which omnipotence itself
   had well nigh given way, and which, while it proved that the strength
   of the sufferer was infinite, proved that the sin for which he
   suffered, in its guilt and in its evil, was infinite also. Christ made
   not a seeming, but a substantial atonement for the sins of the world.
   There was something more than an ordinary martyrdom. There was an
   actual laying on of the iniquities of us all; and, however little we
   are fitted for diving into the mysteries of the divine
   jurisprudence---however obscurely we know of all that was felt by the
   Son of God when the dreadful hour and power of darkness were upon him,
   yet we may be well assured that it was no mockery; that something more
   than the mere representation of a sacrifice, it was most truly and
   essentially a sacrifice itself a full satisfaction rendered for the
   outrage that had been done upon the Lawgiver--his whole authority
   vindicated, the entire burden of his wrath discharged. This is enough
   for all the moral purposes that are to be gained by our faith in
   Christ's"s propitiation. It is enough that we know of the travail of
   his soul. It is enough that he exchanged places with the world he died
   for, and that what to us would have been the wretchedness of eternity,
   was all concentrated upon him, and by him was fully borne."*

CHAPTER XV.

   Humanity of Christ had not Physical Capacities to endure all his
   Sufferings---B13ody and Hum-uaan Soul of Christ differ,,ed in nothing
   but Holiness from those of ordinary Men---Body can suffer only to
   limited Extent---So of Human Soul---Sufferings of ris a Chris " t
   Infinite, or., at lea st, beyond Mortal Endurance---Christ'@s Physical
   Capacities not expanded at last Passion---If so, he would not have
   Suffered in our Nature---@"Shifts to which Prevalent Theory is put to
   reconcile Extent of Christ's"s Sufferings with limited Capacities of
   Humanity to suffer.

   HAVING thus completed our review of the dismay with which Christ beheld
   his coming sufferings, -and the perturbation which their endurance
   caused him, we may confidently deduce from the premises the sure
   conclusion that his sufferings were infinite ; or, if not infinite,
   that they inexpressibly surpassed any sufferings which mortal man ever
   bore, or which the highest angel in heaven, united to humanity, could
   have endured. We may now, therefore, return to the farther development
   of the principle which we laid down in a preceding page,* that the body
   and human soul of Christ ;i-had not physical capabilities to become the
   recipient of the amount of sufferings demonstrated by his unparalleled
   dismay at their approach, and his extraordinary perturbation in their
   endurance.

   * See Page 201.

   ******* 218 CHRIST"13 MANHOOD NOT PECULIAR.

   As a preliminary to this branch of our argument, we would remind the
   reader that the body and human soul of Christ differed in nothing from
   the bodies and souls of ordinary men, except in being sinless. This
   important fact rests on the firm basis of the Bible. The leading
   feature in the revealed plan of redemption is, that the second person
   of the Trinity should suffer in our nature. He would not have suffered
   in our nature had his manhood, except in its sinless character, been
   either more or less than the nature of ordinary men. Had he suffered in
   an angelic nature, or in a superhuman nature, he would not have
   suffered. in our nature; and thus the scriptural delineation of the
   atonement itself would have lost its characteristic feature. The
   suggestion so often made and repeated by" theorists, that the body and
   human soul of Christ had peculiar susceptibilities for suffering, finds
   no support in the Oracles of God. The Bible informs us that , "Jesus
   increased in wisdom andii stature" like ordinary youths.---Luke, 2ii.
   52. But on the great fact of the identityv of his body and human soul,
   save in their exemption from sin, with the bodies and souls common to
   our race, the Bible is still more explicit. The Holy Ghost, in language
   not to be frittered away by interpretation, has declared, ",Wherefore
   in all things it behooved hi@rmn to be made like unto his
   brethren."---Hebrews, 2ii. 17.

   CAPACITY OF BODY AND MIND LIMITED. 219

   The identity between the manhood of Christ and our common nature being
   thus established, we may now avail ourselves of this interesting fact
   for the purpose of showing that his humanity had not physical
   capabilities to endure the weight of corporeal and spiritual sufferings
   manifestly devolved on him as the substitute for the sins of the world.

   It is a principle of our nature, that the human body can, for the time,
   become the receptacle of only a given amount of suffering. Its
   capabilities of suffering are finite and limited. Those best schooled
   in the management of the rack, doubtless the most formidable instrument
   of cruelty, learned, from long experience, that there was a point at
   which even fiendish malice required them to stop in the infliction of
   pain. If, in their infatuated zeal, they were indiscreetly led beyond
   this point, their victim was sure to find respite in temporary
   insensibility. The laws of his physical nature would kindly step in to
   his relief. Hence the professors in the art of extorting human sighs
   and human groans were taught to resort to the more tedious, but sure
   process of lingering torments. Thus they were enabled to effect, by the
   duration of the suffering, what they had failed to accomplish by its
   indiscreet intenseness.

   So of mental suffering. The capacity of the human mind to suffer is,
   like its other faculties, limited. It is limited by those original and
   inflexible principles which form the constitution of the mind. If the
   cup of affliction is full, any new streams of bitterness will but make
   it overflow. When Rachel wept for her children, and refused to be
   comforted because they were not, the annihilation of half a continent,
   by some great convulsion of nature, would not have been likely, for the
   time, to augment her griefs. Mental suffering, like that of the body,
   may be indefinitely increased by its protraction, not by its intensity.

   ***** 220 MANHOOD COULD NOT SO SUFFER.

   The question now directly arises wWhether, with powers limited to the
   ordinary standard of humanity, Christ's"s body and human soul had
   physical capacities to become the recipient of that unutterable weight
   of agony which it is manifest he endured. It is true that we cannot
   determine this question by the application of any rule deduced from the
   exact sciences. We have no balance for accurately weighing the powers
   of humanity to suffer; nor could we, if we dared, apply any process of
   human calculation to measure the precise length, and breadth, and
   height, and depth of the boundless sufferings of our Lord; but
   appearances are sometimes as demonstrative as mathematics; and when,
   with our vision expanded and sublimated by the stupendous scenes of
   Gethsemane and of Calvary, we direct it inward, to view, as through a
   microscope, the diminutive lineaments of our own material and
   immaterial natures, we are driven to the conclusion that the manhood of
   Christ (",made like unto his brethren") could not have been the
   recipient of all his illimitable sufferings with a force of
   demonstration almost as resistless as that which compels our assent to
   a proposition of Euclid.

   MANHOOD COULD NO"I" ",O SITFFTltl. 221

   All must concede the propriety of the conclusion just stated, if they
   believe that the sufferings of Christ were infinite. A finite being
   cannot be made the recipient of infinite anguish in a space less than
   eternity. The infinitude of the pains of the lost children of our race,
   in the abodes of despair, will be diluted by the current of ceaseless
   ages. Should Omnipotence concentrate infinite suffering within the
   compass of even a few brief years, humanity could no more endure it,
   than it could carry the world on its shoulders.

   I 1

   If the sufferings of Christ were less than infinite, did they not still
   exceed the limits of his humanity ? In answering this question in the,
   affirmative, we appeal to the scriptural intimations, scattered through
   the Old and New Testaments, evincing the extremity of our Saviour's"s
   sufferings; we appeal to the indications on the cross, and especially
   to those of the garden; we invoke the bloody sweat of Gethsemane, "
   falling down to the ground" ---to be understood, not as a delusive
   metaphor, but as a stupendous truth; not as applicable to a person
   incapacitated by disease to retain in his veins and arteries the
   circulating and vital fluid, but as applicable to a person in perfect
   health.

   Bring the case to the test of experiment. Fill a human soul brimful, to
   the utmost limit of its physical powers, with sufferings the most
   concentrated and intense that imagination can conceive, and it could
   never force through the pores of its clay tenement a bloody
   perspiration. For the truth of this we appeal to universal history,
   profane and sacred. At Gethsemane, and there alone, has the anguish of
   the spirit ever made the sympathizing and healthful body sweat as it
   were, great drops of blood. The occurrence of this awful exhibition
   there, and there only, proves of itself that the agonies of the garden
   were the throes and spasms of a nature lifted, in its suffering
   capacity, infinitely above the human soul of Christ. Go one step
   farther; make the body a fellow in suffering; after filling the human
   soul full of the keenest anguish to overflowing, load its clay sister
   also with the most exquisite pains, to the utmost limits of its
   physical powers; and the aggregate sufferings of the doubly---laden man
   will probably bear a less proportion to the awful totality of
   Christ's"s sufferings than the drop of the bucket bears to the "
   multitudinous sea." No imaginable concentration of human anguish,
   corporeal and mental, could ever have produced the appalling phenomenon
   which crimsoned the soil of Gethsemane.*

   * See Appendix, No. II, p. 352.

   We may, indeed, suppose that Omnipotence, at the time of the last
   passion, might have expanded the capacity of the manhood of Christ to
   suffersufrer to an almost unlimited extent; but then he would not -have
   suffered in our nature. Had the might of Gabriel been miraculously
   infused into the humanity of Christ, it would no longer have been our
   humanity. The created nature of Christ would have ceased to be human
   nature; it would have become a compound of the human and the angelic.
   The characteristic feature of the atonement of the Bible would thus
   have been maniarred. Christ would no longer have been ",in all things
   like unto his brethren." Had Christ suffered in this mingled nature,
   how could he have been what his apostle Peter represents him to have
   been when he says, " Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example
   ?"---1 I Peter, 2ii. 21. How could he have left us an example, with any
   expectation of our following it, unless he had actually suffered in our
   common nature ? The supposition that he also suffered in his divine
   nature does not impair the efficacy of his human example. The
   supposition presents to us a suffering man to imitate ; a suffering God
   to adore.

   See Appendix, No. ", p. 352.

   MANHOOD NOT EXPANDED. 223

   According to this aspect of the prevalent theory, Christ suffered in
   neither his divine nor human nature, but in a compound nature specially
   wrought out for the occasion, and nowhere intimated in the Bible. An
   angel appeared in the garden of Gethsemane. But angel visits, while
   they impart consolation and strengthen faith, do not change the nature
   of the being visited. The faithful Abraham and the wrestling Jacob
   remained unaltered at the departure of their celestial visitant, except
   in increase of holiness.- We do not infer that the " strengthening"
   envoy of the garden added anything to the physical capabilities of the
   sufferer for the endurance of pain. To impart to an ordinary man the
   strength of Samson, by miraculous interposition, to prepare him for
   some great bodily feat, would be to effect a change of his corporeal
   nature. To have imparted to the human soul of Christ, by miraculous
   interposition, the strength and fortitude of an archangel, to prepare
   him for the endurance of his last passion, would have been to effect a
   change in the elements of the incorporeal portion of his humanity. He
   would then rather have taken on him " the nature of angels," than have
   remained of the unmixed " seed of Abraham."---

   Hebrews, 2ii. 16.

   True, the manhood of Christ was made for suffering. Nevertheless it was
   endowed with no supernatural capabilities of endurance; it was cast in
   the common mould of humanity. Its physical ability to suffer was no
   greater than pertains to ordinary men. Had it exceeded the common
   standard of humanity, Inspiration would not have affirmed of him,
   ",Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his
   brethren." He was not like unto his brethren, if his human nature
   differed from theirs in the paramount article of its suffering
   capacity. And if he was " made like unto his brethren," he continued "
   like unto his brethren" until his mediatorial sufferings were "
   finished." Increase of physical capacity for the exigencygency of of
   his last passion, is not intimated in Scripture. It is a gratuitous
   assumption of the prevalent theory. The contrary, indeed, is to be
   justly inferred from the Inspired Volume.

   The Bible would not have exhibited the patience of Christ in endurance
   from the cradle to the grave as a pattern to be successfully imitated
   by mortals, unless he had at all times remained, not only the Lord of
   glory, but also a frail man, " like unto his brethren", in the
   suffering elements of his humanity. The incarnation constituted him
   very man in all his weakness, as well as very God in all his might, by
   an in@@,dissolr,,soluble union of his two changeless natures. We
   believe that any subsequent and supernatural modification of his
   manhood before death would have been opposed to the laws of the holy
   union. If the humanity of Christ was the humanity of our common nature
   in the workshop of Joseph, it doubtless continued such in the garden of
   Gethsemane,. and on the cross of Calvary. The sweat of labou"r and the
   sweat of blood flowed alike from the same feeble mortality. The infant
   wailings of the manger, and the expiring wailings which shook the
   firm-seated earth, proceeded from the self-same being, unaltered save
   in physical and natural growth.

   To reconcile the magnitude of Christ's"s sufferings with the limited
   capabilities of humanity to suffer, has ever been one of the most
   trying shifts of the prevalent theory. One class of its advocates, as
   has already appeared, have imagined that the manhood of Christ was
   mysteriously endowed with superhuman susceptibilities and powers of
   sufferance; but this airy phantom has not a scriptural intimation on
   which to perch itself. Another class of its adherents have sought to
   solve the phenomenon by depreciating the magnitude of the mediatorial
   sufferings. Whitby, the commentator, with a reckless hand, has
   undertaken to cut the Gordian knot, which he could not untie, by
   sinking to-corporeal pains the expiatory agonies of the Son of f

   God. Even the learned, eloquent, and devout

   Dwight felt himself constrained to declare that

   ****** 226 CHRIST"S SUFFERINGS EXPLAINED.

   "The degree of suffering which Christ underwent in making the atonement
   was far inferior to that which will be experienced@ by an individual
   sufferer beyond the grave."

   17

   So the Herculean intellect of the profound author of the " Freedom of
   the Will" " was obliged to seek refuge from the anomalies of the
   prevalent theory, in the same hypothesis.*

   *Whitby's Comments on Matthew, 26. 38; Dwight's Theology, vol.

   2. p. 217; Edwards's Works, vol. 8. pp. 176, 177 New York, 1830.

   Such depreciation of the price of redemption is without scriptural
   authority. The Bible nowhere intimates such a paucity of mediatorial
   sufferings; nor can reason evince the sufficiency of such limited
   sufferings to redeem a world by any process of human arithmetic. The
   debts of the redeemed to the exchequer of heaven were infinite, or,
   rather they consisted of a countless number of infinitudes; for each of
   the redeemed owed, for his single self, an infinite debt. Suffering was
   the only coin in which satisfaction could be, received. The second
   person of the Trinity, clothed in flesh, became the Substitute for the
   redeemed. For their suff@erings he mercifully interposed his own. If
   divine justice exacted full payment in kind to the uttermost far-thing,
   then he must have suffered as much as all the redeemed, but for him,
   would have suffered collectively, pang for pang, spasm for spasm, sigh
   for sigh, groan for groan; he must have suffered not only infinitely,
   but the infinitude of his suffering must have been multiplied by the
   number of the countless -countless redeemed.

   * Whitby@s Comments on Matthew, xxvi, 38; Dwight"s Theology, vol. ii.
   p. 217; Edwards"s Works, vol. viii. pp. 176, 177 New York, 1830.

   BY PARTICIPATION OF DIVINITY. 227

   But it is, perhaps, the more general faith of Christendom, that Christ
   did not specifically pay the debts of the redeemed in kind and in full,
   as such payment might have enabled them to demand from eternal justice
   the remission of their sins as matter of right, and not of" mere grace.
   We eschew all debateable ground not directly connected with the main-.i
   position of our argument. Yet without departing from the line of
   neutrality on collateral points, we may be permitted to remind those
   who have adopted the last-named opinion, that their belief requires for
   its vital aliminent the supposition that such deficiency as existed in
   the quantity of Christ's sufferings, compared with what would have been
   the aggregate sufferings of the redeemed, wasg made up by the
   transcendent superiority of its quality. For it cannot be imagined that
   the infinite Father, in accepting the substituted sufferingc, of the
   Mediator, could have intended, by an act of flexible grace, to lower
   the awful dignity of his own violated justice.

   Were we permitted to believe that the divinity of Christ actually
   participated in his sufferings, then, indeed, any difficulty connected
   with their numerical quantity might be mitigated, and perhaps removed.
   The participation of his divinity in his sufferings might have supplied
   their deficiency in quantity, compared with what the redeemed must have
   endured, by imparting to them an infinitely enhanced value. But the
   advocates of the prevalent theory, through all their classes, utterly
   deny that the divinity of Christ actually participated in his expiatory
   sufferings. To exclude the belief that his divinity actually suffered
   has.-, been their object for fifteen centuries. To this object they
   have clung with a tenacity which time has not been able to loosen.

   ****** 228 CIIRIST"S SUFFERINGS EXPLAINED

   Yet does the prevalent theory require, for its vital principle, that
   there should have been an infusion of divinity into the mediatorial
   sufferings. This infusion we give in the awful fact that the divinity
   of Christ actually participated in all he underwent. The prevalent
   theory seeks to impart the divine infusion by supposing that the
   redeeming man suffered actually, and the redeeming God constructively.
   A preliminary objection to this supposition is, that it lacks
   scriptural support. The Bible, from its first verse to its last, gives
   no such intimation. It rests on human authority alone. The persons of
   the glorious Trinity are not wont to act constructively. Whatever they
   do, they do actually. It was not constructively that the Son of God
   created the worlds. It is not constructively that he will, one day,
   judge the quick and the dead. His heaven and his hell are not
   constructive. Nor was it merely constructively that his ethereal
   essence tasted "of death for every man."

   The prevalent theory has a navigation embarrassed with more real
   obstacles than those imagined to inhibit the passage of the Sicilian
   strait when haunted by the fabled terrors of early mythology. When it
   raises to their proper altitude its conceptions of the infinite
   magnitude of the mediatorial agonies, it encounters the insuperable
   difficulties arising from the limited@- ,c@apacities of humanity to
   suffer. If it lowers its views to the standard of humanity's"s limited
   powers, its meager estimate of the atoning sufferings affords but
   scanty aliment for the redemption of a world. The theory has its Scylla
   on the one side, and its Charybdis on the other. Nothing but the
   unequalled, though noiseless skill of its navigators has hitherto saved
   it from shipwreck.

   Whichever way we wander, we are thus drawn back to the great central
   truth that the second person of the Trinity, clothed in manhood,
   suffered and died, as well in hiWs ethereal essence as in hiMs human
   nature, for the salvation of man. This august truth cannot, indeed,
   fully unravel the " mystery of godliness." That still remains, as it
   was beheld by the apostle and the angels, shrouded in its own ineffable
   majesty, " high and lifted up" above the ken of mortal scrutiny ; but
   it clears the spiritual horizon of the vapours and clouds which human
   theories have congregated there. If it were believed that a God, made
   sin for sinners, was just about to meet the " fierceness and wrath"if"
   of an avenging God, the scene at Gethsemane, though towering to the
   third heaven in interest and grandeur, would lose some of its marvels.
   The bloody perspiration forcing itself through the corporeal substance
   of the incarnate, self-devoted Deity; the shaking, almost to
   annihilation, of ",the temple of his body;" the momuientary, eager,
   soultouching supplication that, if possible, the cup might pass from
   him; the appearance of the " strengthening" envoy from the celestial
   court, are what even the finite imagination might shadow forth as the
   appropriate preludes of an exhibition, from which the dismayed sun fled
   away.

   The explanation unfolded by this august central truth, though it may
   not, durst not, cannot draw fully aside the veil of the inner
   sanctuary, where " the chastisement of our peace was upon Him@" who
   created the worlds, yet indicates to our adoring vision the viewless,
   hidden cause, from whose mighty workings came that wondrous contrast
   between the penitent, joyous, exulting malefactor, and the suffering,
   writhing, sinking Deity by his side; extorting from his bursting spirit
   the piercing cry sent up to the Ancient of Days, ",My God! my God! why
   hast thou forsaken me?"

   If the redeeming God suffered in his divine essence, he must have
   suffered to a degree surpassing the apprehension of mortal man;
   probably surpassing the comprehension of the brightest archan. gel. He
   would not have healed " slightly the hurt of the daughter of his
   people."---Jeremiah, 6vi. 14. He would not, by the paucity of the
   expiatory sufferings, have sunk, in the estimation of created
   intelligences, the dignity of his own divine law. Such sufferings must
   have been felt by the redeeming God as only a God has capacity to feel.
   If they did not pierce the very core of his divine heart, they might
   have lacked full atoning merit. They might have detracted from the
   grandeur of the Godhead; they might not have surpassed in magnificence
   the glory of the created worlds; they might have failed to I form the
   brightest crown of Him who " wears on his head many crowns." And if,
   indeed, the God thus suffered, we might have expected that the near
   approach of his infinite agonies would have caused anticipations new
   and " strange" in the flight of eternal ages. We need not be surprised
   that their actual occurrence rent asunder the solid rocks, and
   convulsed to its centre the firm-seated, yet shuddering earth.

   The precise mode in which the uncreated Son suffered in his ethereal
   essence to atone for the sins of our world we know not, nor dare we
   irreverently inquire. The stupendous fact of his own vicarious
   suffering is, of itself, the all-sufficient rock of Christian hope and
   Christian confidence. Its mode, if communicable to mortal apprehension,
   infinite wisdom has not seen fit to reveal. Systems of theism,
   manufactured in the laboratories of earth, ever abound in minute
   details, designed to lure the imagination and to gratify the longing
   inquisitiveness of our fallen race, to probe the secrets of the " world
   unknown." Such was the mythology of classic antiquity, with its poetic
   gods, its poetic heaven, and its poetic hell. Such is the Koran of
   Mohammed, with its voluptuous paradise.

   Such is not the Bible of the true God. Its revelations, like the
   supplies of miraculous food to the wayfaring Israelites, are just
   sufficient for our spiritual wants. There is no lack, no redundancy.

   ****** 232 BIBLE FEEDS NOT CURIOSITY.

   The Bible contains ample nutriment for the immortal soul ; not a jot of
   aliment for idle curiosity.

   Any surplus of revealed communications might be but a receptacle for
   the worms of polemic speculation.---Exodus, 16xvi. 20. This exact
   economy of its revelations is a distinguishing characteristic of
   Scripture, strongly indicative of its celestial parentage. The
   Scripture is its own best witness. The stars of the firmament and the
   Bible of our closets bear upon their faces the like inherent
   demonstration that their Architect is divine.

   BAPTISM TO BE BAPTIZED WITTI. 233
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVI.

   Christ's"s Anticipations of last Passion previous to Night of
   Gethsemane--@Luke, 12xii. 49-51: "I have a baptism to be baptized
   with"l@---John, 12xii. 27, 28: "Now is my soul troubled"---John,
   13xiii. 21: " HIle was troubled in spirit"---Heb. 5v. 7, 8: " When he
   hbad offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and
   tearxs"---Objection answered arising from Divine Prescieniace
   ---Progress of Christ's"s Anticipations.

   PREVIOUS to the night of Gethsemane, the apprehension of his
   approaching suffering had, more than once-@d"@e,, visibly affected the
   incarnate God. The first passage illustrating this truth is the
   following: "I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it
   be already kindled ?"---Luke, 12xii. 49. "14But I have a baptism to be
   baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!"--
   Luke, 12xii. 50. " Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on the
   earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division."---Luke,te# 12xii. 51. The
   whole passage has been transcribed, with a view the better to exhibit,
   in all its potency, the full meaning of the fiftieth verse. The speaker
   was Christ. The dreaded baptism was his last passion. Who was
   "straitened" until the baptism should be accomplished ? Was it the man
   only? or was the indwelling God also " straitened?" Did the distressing
   apprehension pervade the whole self of the divine speaker? or did it
   touch only his manhood, that finite speck, which bore a less proportion
   to the majestic whole than the glow--worm bears to the sun in the
   firmament ?

   In theIn the forty-ninth and fifty-first verses his Godhead was clearly
   the paramount theme of the divine speaker. He adverted to his having "
   come" into the world : manifestly referring to his advent as the second
   person of the Trinity. He announced one of the effects of hiMs having "
   come" into the world. His advent was to " send fire" and engender
   "division" on the earth. The foretold "ii shaking of the nations" was
   to be effected, not by the meek and pacific son of Mary, but by the
   almighty power of the indwelling God. The piercing " division" created
   by the Gospel pervaded and severed the sinews, and arteries, and very
   heart of the social world. A fire was kindled on the day of Pentecost,
   whose mighty conflagration scarcely ceased to rage until the faith of
   the fishermen had fixed its sandalled foot on the; throne of the
   Cae,%sars. This triumph of the@ religion of the cross over the
   marshalled powers of unbelieving man, armed with the terrors of
   persecution, headed by the prince of darkness, and re-enforced by all
   his legions, was, perhaps, the most stupendous miracle ever displayed
   by him who came ",to send fire on the earth."

   If, then, in the forty-ninth and fifty-first verses of this memorable
   passage, the Godhead of the divine speaker was thus the almost
   exclusive theme, is it indeed true that, in the intervening, or
   fiftieth verse, it became, as it were, utterly merged in the little
   atom of his manhood? Did the divinity suddenly pass, in the "continuous
   discourse, under a total eclipse at the end of the forty-ninth verse,
   which eclipse as suddenly disappeared at the beginning of the
   fifty-first? Or, to drop the figures, did the incarnate God, at the
   commencement of the fiftieth verse, abruptly descend from hiMs divinity
   to his mere manhood, and as abruptly re-ascend, at the end of that
   verse, from his mere manhood back to his divinity? Such a double
   transition, so instantaneously repeated, would have seemed almost a
   phenomenon, had we been forced to yield our credence to its existence,
   by intrinsic indications that such was the intention of the speaker;
   but there are no such indications on the face or in the relations of
   the passage. The divine speaker passed through these contiguous and
   kindred verses, himself designated in each by the same personal pronoun
   " I," without the slightest intimation of any change in the natures of
   which he spoke. The subject represented by that personal pronoun
   formed, in each of the three verses, the one undivided and indivisible
   theme. If his divinity was the chief agent in sending "fire" and
   engendering "division" on the earth, his divinity was to be the chief
   recipient of the dreaded " baptism."

   To impute to the speaking God a double change of subject, radical and
   vast as the change from the infinite to the finite, and thence back
   again from the finite to the infinite, affecting, too, his own united
   being, within the compass of this brief passage, without a shadow of
   change in the language which his wisdom chose, would seem, indeed, like
   the mere dream of fancy; or, if we are obliged to view it as a daylight
   atnd waking theory, we cannot but regard it as one of the boldest
   eff"orts of that "bold hypothesis, " God is impassible." Such a dream,
   or such a theory, if so we must call it, should find no registered
   place among the fundamental articles of Christian faith.

   If, then, we may justly infer from the language of Christ, in the
   fiftieth verse of the passage under review, compared with his language
   in the german verses, which go before and after it, that he intended to
   comprehend in that verse, as well as in the other two, both of his
   united natures, we have the conclusive authority of the Son of God,
   that his divinity as well as his manhood was "straitened" by the dread
   of the coming " baptism."

   The next passage showing that the dismay of the incarnate God, caused
   by his approaching sufferings, had anticipated the scene of the
   garta@den is the following: " Now is my soul troubled; and@ what shall
   I say? Father, save me from this hour.; but for this cause came I unto
   this hour."---John, 12xii. 27. What soul was troubled? The prevalent
   theory would say that it was the mere human soul of the divine victim.
   So said not the divine victim himself His declaration, in its plain and
   obvious import, comprehended his whole united spirituality. The
   limiting adjective " human" fell not from the lips of the incarnate
   God. It is the interpolation of .earth.

   "Father, save me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this
   hour." The august Comer was the second person of the Trinity. Upon his
   advent he had received the " body" prepared for him, and thus ,
   "manifest in the fleshs@" had meekly awaited that hour of hours. But
   upon the near approach of that tremendous hour, new and "strange" in
   the annals of eternity, when God the Father was to pour on God the Son,
   made sin for sinners, the storm of infinite wrath, compounded of the "
   multitudinous" transgressions of all the redeemed, the self-devoted
   victim, almighty as he was, for a moment stood appalled. " Father, save
   me from this hour." The august Comer and the momentary Supplicant were
   one, designated by the little pronouns ",I" and ",me." Both pronouns
   referred to the self-same Being; both referred to the totality of that
   Being; both included within their illimitable import the whole
   incarnate Deity. The coming God, the "troubled" God, the supplicating
   God were identical. In each stage of the stupendous action the God was
   the chief Actor, the man but the humble adjunct.

   Farther proof that, of Christ's"s painful a-inticipations, -the garden
   was not the first witness, is to be found in the following passage:
   "When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified,
   and said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray
   me."---John, 13xiii. 21. This passage has its date just after -our
   Lord's"s institution of the sacramental supper, and on the same night
   in which his prediction of the treason of one of his disciples was
   fulfilled. The Greek word here translated "spirit" is used in the
   Bible, as well as the dictionary, in opposition to matter. Its
   scriptural, as well as its lexicographic meaning, is " immaterial
   substance." It denotes animated immateriality, whether found in man, in
   angels, or in the Godhead. Take the following s,pecimens of its
   application to the divine essence. St. Peter said of Christ: " Being
   put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit;" meaning
   doubtless, by the quickening Spirit, the Spirit of the Omnipotent. ---1
   Peter, 3iii. 18. The "Alpha and Omega," who appeared to his beloved
   disciple in the first three chapters of Revelation, styled himself the
   "Spirit." " Hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches."--
   Revelation, 2ii. 17. "God is a Spirit," declared the same inspired
   disciple.---John, 4iv. 24.

   "He was troubled in spirit." The term "spirit" was clearly applicable,
   according to its scriptural meaning, to his ethereal essence; it was
   just as applicable to his ethereal essence as to his human intellect.
   Inspiration employed a term whose natural, boundaries included both. To
   exclude his divinity would be doing violence to those natural
   boundaries. It would be reducing them, by force and arms, from their
   inherent infinitude down to the finite compass of humanity. Inspiration
   interposed no discrimination between the human intellect and the
   ethereal essence of Christ. If we are permitted to understand the term
   as Inspiration has elsewhere taught us to understand it, his whole
   immaterial being, in both its elements, "was troubled." "We are
   ignorant of any principle of grammar or of logic -by ,which human
   reason can interpose any discriminating barrier. Yet has the theory of
   presuming man dared to lay down on the scriptural map a line of
   demarcation, impassable as the walls of heaven, where no line of
   demarcation has been marked by the Holy Ghost. It has dared to affirm
   that Inspiration was so absorbed in the human as to lose sight of the
   divine Spirit of the incarnate God.

   In this connexion, a pas-sage from one of the epistles, manifestly
   referring to the agonies of Christ at Gethsemane, may advantageously be
   introduced: ,"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up
   prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto Him that
   was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
   though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he
   suffered."---Hebrews, 5v. 7, 8. Who was the supplicant of this passage
   that "offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and
   tears?" It was certainly Christ. In what nature did he thus agonizingly
   supplicate? We suppose in both his natures; especially inixi his
   paramount, or divine nature.

   The earnest supplicant was distinguished, in the passage, by two
   characteristic marks: he was "a Son," the eternal Son; and he thus
   strongly supplicated "in the days of his flesh;" that is to say, in the
   days of his manhood on earth. The eternal Sonship of the supplicant was
   not predicable of the human progeny of Mary; nor were the expressions,
   "in the days of his flesh." The phrase, "in the days of his flesh,"
   implies that there had been a time when the tearful supplicant had not
   been in the flesh; not clothed in human nature; when he had existed in
   another mode or state of being.

   But the manhood of Christ had never been out of the flesh. It was
   created in the flesh; it was in the flesh in the manger; it was in the
   flesh on the cross; it was in the flesh, awaiting its quick returning
   spirit, in the tomb of Joseph; it is in the flesh on the right hand of
   God. It was only to the divinity of Christ that the inspired, writer to
   the Hebrews could have applied the descriptive peculiarity, ",in the
   days of his flesh." That was, indeed, a memorable era in the eternity
   of the second person of the Trinity. He had been a disembodied and
   glorious Spirit from everlasting. He first came into the flesh when he
   made hiNmself incarnate. The days of the God Christ Jesus on earth were
   emphatically and descriptively "the day,-s of h" is flesh." But the
   phrase would have been unmeaning if applied to the man Christ Jesus. It
   would have marked no era in his existence.

   We have it, then, established by two distinguishing and unerring badges
   that the Supplicant in the passage from Hebrews was not simply the
   human offspring of the Virgin. His "prayers and supplications with
   strong crying and tears" were not the mere ebullitions of human
   frailty. The Supplicant was the eternal Son of God. To him pertained a
   state of antecedent existence, not comprehended " in the days of his
   flesh." The Supplicant, then, was, the second, the incarnate person of
   the Trinity. The implorin" g voice; the strong crying; the tears; ; the
   spirit which prompted that crying and those tears, were his. He who
   ",feared " was hbe who had made the worlds. In this fearing,
   deprecatory scene of the mediatorial drama the divinity predominated as
   much as it did in the stupendous scene where the "five barley loaves
   and two small fishes" were made the superabundant aliment of five
   thousand famished persons.

   But was it, indeed, the second person ofe the Trinity clothed in
   manhood, who " offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying
   and tears," and "was heard in " -that he feared?" Let Gethin semane
   answer the inquiry. Let the garden, where, "being in an agony, he
   prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was, as it were, great drops of
   blood falling down to the ground," reveal the awful truth. Let the
   angel respond who appeared unto him " from heaven strengthening" the
   "fearing," the almost sinking God.

   We have heard it orally objected that if, at the approach of Christ's"s
   passion, the dismay caused by its anticipation affected his divine
   nature, the same anticipation must equally have affected his divinity
   before it became incarnate; that to the divine mind the past and the
   future are one concentrated now; that to HIfim who fills eternity the
   anticipation of the cross wivas just as vivid before the creation of
   the world@is as it was in the garden; that our doctrine, therefore,
   would convert the illimitable preexistence of the Son of God into one
   saddened, unbroken Gethsemane.

   To this objection we have a ready response. If we have failed to show,
   by scriptural evidence, that the divinity of Christ shared in the
   dismay caused by his approaching suffering, then this particular branch
   of our argument fails of itself. It needs not to be assailed by
   extraneous objection; it sinks under the burden of its own weight; its
   foundation is ascertained to be laid in unstable sandlid. But if we
   have succeeded in showing, by scriptural proofs, that the divinity of
   Christ participated in the dismay caused by his coming passion, then is
   our position fixed upon a rock. Underneath it is the everlasting
   foundation of the Bible. And because human reason, dimly peering
   through its earthy telescope, cannot scan the vast dimensions of that
   infinite Essence " manifest in the flesh," so as to ascertain with
   precision how his divine nature could, in harmony with all his
   attributes, have partaken of the dismay caused by the anticipated
   outpouring of his Father's"s wrath, shall human reason, thus thwarted
   by the diminutiveness of its own powers of vision, venture boldly to
   repudiate a doctrine proved to be scriptural, and so deeplyv
   interesting to Christian faith?

   Other answers to the objection may be given. The supposition that the
   past eternity and the future eternity are, to the divine mind, one
   concentrated now, rests not on scriptural authority. It is based on
   metaphysical speculation. Human reason has no right to speculate
   concerning the unrevealed mysteries of God; to convert his eternity
   into one monotonous now; to deprive him of the joys of retrospect, and
   the delights of anticipation. The past and the future are essentially
   different from the present, in the nature of things. The Omnipotent
   could not, by the word of his power, make them identical, without
   violating the inflexible laws of his empire, any more than he could
   make two and two amount to five. That past things and future things
   should be present things is a physical contradiction. The Son of God is
   not now creating the worlds; he is not now suspended on the cross; he
   is not now judging the quick and the dead. To view those widely
   separated events as contemporaneous, would be to view them falsely.

   The God of truth sees things as they are. He views the past as gone,
   the future as to come, the present alone as actually present. To his
   mind the deluge is not now riding in triumph over the tops of the
   mountains; to his mind the elements are not now melting with fervent
   heat. Progression is a fundamental principle of God's"s empire, and
   progressive events are viewed as progressive by the infinitely wise
   Legislator. The reckless violation of all laws by the afterward
   penitent malefactor, his belief with the heart when apostles fled, and
   his repose in paradise on the bosom of his redeeming God, were not
   simultaneous events in the estimation of the dwellers upon the earth,
   or in the view of Him who " inhabiteth eternity."

   The memory of the Deity, doubtless, reaches back to the earliest past;
   his prescience reaches forward to the latest future. Eternity and
   immensity have no recesses hidden from omniscience. How vivid may be
   his anticipations of coming events, brought home by his unerring
   prescience, the Bible has not told us with perfect distinctness. On
   this sacred theme we may, perhaps, without irreverence, draw some
   twilight imaginings from the analogy of his earthly substitute, made in
   his own image, and after his own likeness, and into whose nostrils he
   breathed " the breath of life." To a good man it may be revealed, as it
   was to Peter, that a violent death awaits him. The conviction of his
   bitter doom is sure; the cruel death dwells ever in his conscious
   breast. Yet does not its sting disturb his happiness or serenity, until
   the hour draws nigh for the triumph of the king of terrors.

   So the Bible shadows forth the progressive invatenseness of the
   anticipations of the Son of God, caused by his approaching suffering.
   When he foretold his passion first, it produced in him little seeming
   emotion. "From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples
   how he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things."---Matthew,
   16xvi. 21. " "And he began to teach them that the Son of man must
   suffer many things."---Mark, 8viii. 31. A little farther onward, in
   Luke, he declared, "But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how
   am I straitened till it be accomplished." Still onward, in John, he
   exclaimed, "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save
   me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour." And at
   Gethsemane, when the dreaded "baptism," the tremendous "hour" was just
   at hand, ",being in an agony," he sweat " as it were great drops of
   blood falling down to the ground."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVII.

   Proofs of Divinity of Christ'@s Sufferings derived from Old
   Testament---Fifty--third Chapter of Isaiah---Isaiah 63lxiii. 3: "I have
   trodden the winiie-press alone"l@---Isaiah 63Ixiii. 9: "In all their
   affliction he was afflicted" 2---Zechariah, 13xiii. 7: "Awake, sword,
   against my Shepherd"---Zecharxiah, 12xii. 10: "And they shall look upon
   Me whomra they have pierced."

   IN the progress of our argument, we have hitherto confined ourselves to
   evidence deduced from the New Testament. But the Old Testament is not
   to be overlooked or undervalued. Though its holy patriarchs and
   prophets saw . as ",through a glass darkly," yet does the wonderful
   fulfilment of their inspired visions afford one of the most striking
   proofs of the verity of our holy religion. The Old Testament shadows
   forth the Messiah to come in colours not to be mistaken. It plainly
   intimates his miraculous conception ; it places the glorious truth of
   his divinity beyond peradventure; it announces him as the sufferer for
   the sins of others in terms peculiar and significant; and when it thus
   alludes to him as a sufferer, it limits not his sufferings to a single
   department of his being; it speaks of him, not as a partial, but as a
   general sufferer. The prevalent theory of later times, that the
   sufferings of Christ were confined to his humanity, finds no
   countenance in the Old Testament. The Old Testament leaves us to
   believe that the expected Messiah would suffer in the same undivided
   and indivisible natures in which hlie was to be born into our world.

   The last three verses of the fifty-second chapter of Isaiah, and the
   whole of the fifty-third chapter of that sublimest of the sons of men,
   have Christ for their absorbing theme. Their reference to the Messiah
   who was to come is so palpable that, in reading the passages, we may
   consider the name of Christ as actually substituted for the nameless
   sufferer, whose heart-touching story is there told with a pathos not to
   be found in the " multitudinous" volumes of uninspired lore. With a pen
   dipped in his tears, the rapt prophet recounted the imputed
   imperfections and outward pangs of his beloved Saviour; his marred
   visage; his want of form and comeliness to the carnal eye; his
   rejection by men; his privations; his lamb-like submission. But when he
   drew near to the furnace of expiatory suffering burning within,
   pervading the spiritual elements of the incarnate God in the most
   inaccessible recesses of his sacred being, the prophet's"s powers of
   expression, copious as they were, seemed utterly inadequate to the
   overpowering thoughts that were hovering around him. He could but say,
   "His soul" shall be made "an offering for sin;" "he shall pour out his
   soul unto death;" "he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall
   be satisfied."---Isaiah, 53Iiii. 10-12.

   The Hebrew word here translated ",soul" " is of most capacious import.
   It signifies breathing, living immateriality, wherever found. In the
   first chapter of his inspired history, Moses applied this Hebrew term
   to designate the vital principle of the lower ranks of animated nature,
   though our translators have there rendered it " creature."---Genesis,
   1i. 24. The royal psalmist used this identical Hebrew word to denote
   the ethereal essence of the Deity. " The Lord trieth the righteous: but
   the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth."--@Psalm 11xi.
   5. The same Hebrew word was used for the same purpose in Judges. " And
   they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord:
   and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel."---Judges, 10x. 16.
   The same Hebrew word was also four times used in Jeremiah to express
   the ethereal essence of God. "

   Shall I not visit for these thingo-s, saith the Lord: and shall not my
   soul be avenged on such a nation as this?" Jeremiah, 5v. 9. This same
   verse is afterwards twice repeated, forming the twenty-ninth verse of
   the same chapter, and also the ninth verse of the ninth chapter. "Yeao,
   I" (the Lord) ,"will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will
   plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and my whole
   soul."---Jeremiah, 32xxxii. 41. Isaiah himself, in his first chapter,
   represents the Majesty of heaven as declaring to rebellious Israel,
   "Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth."---Isaiah,
   1i. 14.

   When Isaiah appropriated the same Hebrew term to the expected Messiah;
   the predicted Immanuel; the , "child" that should be born ; the "s"ton"
   that should be given; whose name should be called "Wonderful,
   Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of
   Peace," he must have meant to use the term in as comprehensive a sense
   as it was used by his brother-prophets, and as he had himself used it
   in his opening chapter. He must have intended to designate the whole
   breathing, animated, living immateriality of the God " manifest in the
   flesh," whose advent had, from the creation, formed the glowing theme
   of inspired prediction and heaven-taught song. The Hebrew word is used
   by the evangelical prophet without stint or limitation. The human soul
   of the anticipated Messiah, the,, "Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty
   God, the everlasting Father," was so small a speck in the distant and
   boundless horizon of his united a-nd infinite spirituality as scarcely
   to engage, much less to absorb the expanded vision of the ravished
   seer.

   The prophet Isaiah must, then, be understood as saying, that the whole
   immaterial nature of Christ should be made an offering for sin; that
   his whole immaterial nature should be poured out unto death; that he
   should see of the travail of his whole imrnmaterial nature and be
   satisfied. If any biblical critic should wish to limit the Hebrew word
   translated ",soul" to the mere human soul of Christ, I let him test the
   accuracy of his criticism by actually inserting before the substantive
   "I " soul" as of@ten as it is here repeated, the adjective " human." We
   do not perceive how the critic can object to this test; for, if the
   adjective is to be silently incorporated byv intendment, it might as
   well be actually incorporated "by an overt act. We have already alluded
   to this test as applicable to passages in the New Testament; but its
   importance seems to justify its repetition here.

   The prophecy of Isaiah contains other passages bearing on our subject.
   " I have trodden the winepress alone."---Isaiah, 63Ixiii, 3. If this
   passage referred to the passion of Christ, it is full of demonstration
   that both his natures unitedly suffered. The wine-press trodden was not
   the wine-press of some earthly vintage. It was, what it was elsewhere
   called in Scripture, "the wine-press of the wrath and fierceness of
   almighty God." "I have trodden the wine-press alone" was a declaration
   of too lofty and awful an import to have been designed by the Holy
   Ghost for the ",meek and lowly" human son of the Virgin. The solitary
   Treader of "the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of almighty God"
   was the second person of the Trinity, arrayed, indeed, in the
   habiliments of manhood. None but a God could have trodden the terrible
   wine-press of the wrath of God. The human son of Mary had not physical
   capabilities to tread this wine-press alone; and had his humanity been
   expanded for the awful event by the omnipotence of its indwelling God,
   it would thenceforth have ceased to be the humanity of our common race.

   The Treader of the wine-press had trodden it alone. If the man had been
   its treader, strengthened by the divinity within, solitariness could
   not have been predicated of him. He is not alone w"Who knows himself to
   be attended and supported by an indwelling Deity. Gabriel is not alone,
   though, apart from his fellow-angels, he may stand in more close
   attendance on the inaccessible majesty of the Highest. The three holy
   men, " upon whose bodies the fire had no power," were not alone in the
   Babylonian furnace. There was a fourth present; ",and the form of the
   fourth" was "like the Son of God." He walked with them through the
   flames, and saved them untouched by the conflagration. Well was it said
   of them that they were not alone.---Daniel, 3iii. 25, 27. Hei- who trod
   the wine-press alone, clothed in his garment of flesh, was none other
   than he who, in the beginning, raised his solitary trumpet note, and
   behold, the dark profound straightway beamed with joyous light.

   We are not ignorant that by a ma@ijority of the advocates of the
   prevalent theory, the Treader of the wine-press is supposed to have
   been, not the suffering Christ, but Christ the Avenger. Many biblical
   critics, respectable for talents, learning, and piety, have thought
   differently. We felt bound to notice the passage, without intending,
   however, to make it a main pillar of our argument. If the reader shall
   concur in its more general interpretation, he has but to subtract from
   the sum total of our scriptural proofs, this single item. We are
   confident that the aggregate of our proofs drawn from Holy Writ may
   well sustain this insulated subtraction.

   "Iin all theiri- affliction he was afflicted."---Isaiah, 63Ixiii. 9.
   This wonderful declaration was predicated, not of the Word made flesh,
   but of the Old Testament Jehovah. Of him, also, the Bible often
   affirmed that he was " grieved." To be " afflicted" or to be "
   grieved," implies actual suffering. If, therefore, these scriptural
   passages are to be taken literally, they cannot fail to overthrow the
   hypothesis of divine impassibility. The advocates of the prevalent
   theory, in attempting to evade the force of the passages, must needs
   clothe them in a figurative meaning. In deciding whether a figurative
   interpretation relieves the advocates of the theory from the pressure
   of the passages, it must be borne in mind that Bishop Pearson, and all
   his associates of the olden and modernm times, claim as the strongest
   position of their theory, that the imputation of even voluntary
   paossibility to the divine nature would imply its " imperfection"
   and"infirmity."

   Now if impassibility is in truth one of the everlasting attributes of
   Jehovah, changeless as his wisdom, power, or holiness---if the
   imputation to him of voluntary paossibility would indeed imply his
   "imperfection" and "infirmity," then, as affliction and grief are
   synonymous with suffering, the Bible could never have declared of him,
   even figuratively, ,that he was "afflicted"---that he was "grieved."
   For by such declarations, the Bible would have imputed "imperfection"
   and " infirmity" to its own all-perfect Author; it would, under the
   guise of a metaphor, have libelled the God of the Bible. Inspiration
   deals, it is true, in figures of speech; but not in figures of speech
   calculated to misrepresent the awful attributes of Jehovah. In imputing
   to the Most High material form and lineaments, the Bible misleads not;
   for it elsewhere takes pains to affirm that ",God is a Spirit," and
   that 4"6 a spirit hath not flesh and bones."

   But its imputation of paossibility to him who is alleged to be
   impassible, finds no explanatory qualification in the sacred pages. The
   imputation, then, according to the prevalent theory, stands forth on
   Holy R" Itecord as a palpable and unexplained misrepresentation of the
   divine attributes, disguised but not mitigated by its figurative form.
   We would scarcely believe our senses of sight and hearing should they
   unitedly inform us that the Bible, under the garb of metaphor, had
   somewhere misrepresented God's"s power, or omniscience, or wisdom, or
   justice, or holiness. And if it be indeed true that God could not
   suffer without ceasing to be God, by what species of moral arithmetic
   can it be ascertained that the impeachment of his impassibility is less
   reprehensible than would be the attempt to pluck from its sphere any of
   the other fixed and everlasting stars which form the glorious
   constellation of his perfections ?

   The following passage carries on its face its own demonstration:
   "Awake, sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my
   fellow, saith the Lord of Hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep
   shall be scattered."---Zechariah, 13xiii. 7. In this sublime and
   wonderful passage, the speaker is the infinite Father. The Son had been
   speaking in the preceding chapter under the name of the "Lord;" but in
   this passage the Father appeared as the speaker, by the appellation of
   the "Lord of Hosts." "What was the subject to be smitten?

   To show that it was to be the Christ, we need scarcely refer to
   Matthew, 26xxvi. 31 ; Mark, 14xiv. 27. The face of the passage itself
   demonstrates, not only that the Father was the speaker, but also that
   the subject to be smitten was the incarnate Son. In what nature was the
   incarnate Son to be smitten? Was it in his two united natures, or in
   one of them only, leaving the other altogether scathless? Our opponents
   allege that the subject to be smitten was the mere humanity of the Son
   incarnate. This they are obliged to allege; for if the smiting was but
   to touch the divine nature of the incarnate God, their theory must
   utterly fail.

   We suppose that the humanity of the incarnate Son was not to be the
   sole subject of the smiting. Of all the wonders of the vast creation,
   visible or invisible, not the least is the -wonder, often pressed on
   our contemplations, of the exact economy of the almighty Creator, in
   his use of means to accomplish his wise and gracious ends. The energies
   invoked, like the manna of the desert, are always just sufficient;
   there is nothing wanting, nothing to spare. The wastefulness of human
   prodigality can find no precedent or countenance in the example of the
   Most High. And did he, so wisely provident of the resources even of his
   own exhaustless and infinite treasury, indeed awaken from its repose
   his own almighty sword-the highest resort of avenging omnipotence-only
   to smite the frail humanity of the man of Nazareth? Had the smiting of
   his mere humanity been the sole object of the Lord of Hosts, its sure
   execution might have been left to the irons of the cross, or to the
   soldier's"s spear, if the irons proved too dilatory in their work.
   There would have been no seeming need for invoking the sword of the
   Lord of Hosts.

   The terms of designation in the passage are demonstrative that the
   subject of the smiting was not the humanity of Christ alone. "Awake,
   sword, against my shepherd." And again, the divine speaker said, ",
   Smite the shepherd." Who was the Shepherd of the Lord of Hosts ? He was
   the great , "Shepherd of Israel"9l that dwelt "between the
   cherubims."---Psalmrns, 80lxxx. 1I. Isaiah, 40xl. 11. "This was the
   Shepherd who meekly descended to earth, to redeem with his blood, and
   gather in from every nation and every climey his Father's"s dispersed
   and lost flock. The humanity of Bethlehem's"s babe was not the Shepherd
   of the Lord of Hosts; it was but the adjunct of that Shepherd; the
   vestment in which that Shepherd arrayed himself; the tabernacle of
   flesh in which that Shepherd dwelt.

   "Father is That same Shepherd of the in" finite Father is yet his
   Shepherd. In the green pastures of paradise he still feeds his
   Father's"s flock; still he folds the lambs in his bosom. There, clothed
   in his now glorified vestment of humanity, he willf continue -the
   Shepherd of the Most High as long as the golden walls of the great
   sheepfold of heaven 4m shall rest secure on their everlasting
   foundations.

   This was the Shepherd against w-%vhose divine, as well as human nature,
   the Lord of Hosts invoked his almighty sword. Spare the God, but sm"
   ite the man, was not his high command. His omnipotent mandate went
   forth without exception or restriction ; general, universal; pervading
   every element, searching out every recess of the united natures ;
   brief, simple, majestic ; yet more lucid than the sunbeam. " Smite the
   Shepherd."

   There is in the passage another term of designation equally significant
   of the subject to be smitten. The Lord of Hosts invoked his slumbering
   sword "6 6 against the man that is my fellow." The ethereal essence of
   the second person of the Trinity formed the divine .nature of the
   incarnate Son ; the body and soul of an ordinary man, cleansed from the
   stain of sin, formed his human nature. The union of these two natures
   is often styled, in Christian phraseology, the God-man@l." It may be
   denominated, with, perhaps, equal force and propriety, the man-God. In
   arranging the two elements of this-the complex name, we may as well
   ascend from the human nature to the divine as to descend from the
   divine nature to the human. It is in the ascending grade that the
   infinite Father himself ranked the two natures. He invoked his
   awakening sword, n1-iot only against "my Shepherd," but also "against
   the man that is my fellow;" that is to say, against the man-God. It was
   not the man alone, but the man-God, that was to be smitten.

   The ",fellow" of the Lord of Hosts was to be smitten. But the mere
   humanity of the Virgin's"s son was not the, "fellow" of the Highest.
   The fellow of the everlasting Father, like his infinite self, must have
   been one who "inhabiteth eternity"---the eternity of the past as well
   as the eternity of the future. The -word ",fellow" as here used is
   synonymous with equal. The appellation -was inapplicable to the mere
   manhood of the incarnate Son ; yet there was veiled within that
   humanity the ethereal essence of the second of the, Sacred Three, who
   was indeed the fellow of the infinite Father; who had occupied the
   right hand seat of the Father's"s throne for countless ages ere time
   was known in the universe. That the humanity of Christ was not the
   fellow of the Most High, is proved by- the declaration fresh from the
   lips of the incarnate God, when speaking of the inferiority of his
   human nature, "For my Father is greater than I."---John, 14xiv. 28.

   The unique being to be smitten, compounded of manhood and divinity,
   styled by the Lord of Hosts, "the man that is my fellow," was the
   Emanuel of the Gospel, "the Christ. of God." He was to be smitten, not
   in his mortal nature alone, but in both the elements, human and divine,
   which constitutied, his inkdividuality. If the awakened sword
   touched&he& the "m"@an" only, the "fellow" of the Most High was not
   smitten; the complex being of the text was not smitten; he who was
   smitten was but the man, and not the man-God; the divine prediction, so
   august in its promulgation, must, we speak it with reverence, have sunk
   in its fulfilment from heaven down to earth. The mandate of the Lord of
   Hosts to his omnipotent sword cannot be thus capriciously depressed to
   the mere humanity of Mary's"s son, without crucifying its palpable,
   breathing, living letter and spirit. Such distortion of divine language
   would have found no place in Christian faith, but for the misleading
   hypothesis of divine impassibility.

   There are yet other expressions, hitherto unnoticed, in this astounding
   passage, indicating that it was something infinitely beyond the mortal
   death of him of Nazareth which called forth the sword of the Lord of
   Hosts from its scabbard. It was summoned to awake; which implies that
   it had previously been in a state of repose---a repose, perhaps, until
   then unbroken in the flight of eternal ages. It was summoned not only
   to awake, but to awake and ",smite" ;" to awake, therefore, in the
   majesty of its might, in the te6rrors of its wrath. It was to do his
   work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange
   act!"---Isaiah, 28xxviii. 21---that the infinite Father invoked his
   slumbering sword. A God was to be smitten by a God! The infinite Father
   was to smite his other self; his own beloved, only-begotten, Son; his
   meek and unresisting Shepherd; the fellow of his everlasting reign! No
   wonder that the sword of the Lord of Hosts---the keenest weapon in the
   armory of heaven---was summoned to awake from its long repose. Nothing
   but the sword of a God should, could have smitten a God.

   In this awful passage we seem to hear the audible voice of the Eternal,
   as it was once heard from Sinai, announcing prophetically the
   tremendous truth, since reiterated by the Holy Ghost, God "s"spared not
   his own Son." How feeble and evanescent was the purposed sacrifice by
   the faithful Abraham, even to typify the finished, the efficient, the
   universe--pervading sacrifice by the infinite Father. We say
   universe-pervading, and, we trust, without irreverence; for who can
   doubt that the whole vast empire of the Godhead was benignly affected,
   to an extent nameless, illimitable, inconceivable, in its peace, in its
   prosperity, in the enduring happiness of its countless worlds, by the
   one great sacrifice on Calvary, seen and viewless!

   There is a preceding passage in the same prophet, which demands our
   attention: ",And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications ;
   and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall
   mourn for him, as one that mourneth for his only son, and shall be in
   bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his
   first-born."---Zechariah, 12xii. 10. This prophecy was uttered by the
   second person of the Trinity. The infinite Father became the speaker in
   the next chapter. In this chapter the speaker was the infinite Son. The
   subject to be pierced was the God "manifest in the flesh."---John,
   19xix. 37.

   The corporeal piercing was not merely the perforation of the
   sufferer's"s inanimate side by the Roman spear; his living hands and
   feet were to be pierced. They shall pierce " my hands and my feet."
   Psalm 22xxii. 16. " Corporal sufferance" was not, however, the sole
   price to be paid for the salvation of man. The "iron entered the soul"
   of the vicarious victim. This is generally allowed, even by the
   advocates of the prevalent theory. The majority believe that the soul
   of the sufferer was pierced ; but their faith stops at the dividing
   line between his human and divine spirit. Why stop at that line? No
   such stopping-place is indicated on the scriptural chart.

   The God was also to be pierced. The speaking God of the prophet was to
   be the pierced God of the evangelist. The awakened sword of the Lord of
   Hosts was to penetrate the most sacred recesses of his divine essence.
   The speaking God of the prophet was the mighty " me" of the prediction.
   "They shall look upon me whom they have pierced." And now mark well the
   sudden and significant change of phraseology: " And they shall mourn
   for him." Why this sudden transmutation of the third for the first
   person ? It was no idle play of words; the transition was big with
   meaning. The speaker was God the Son. He designated by the pronoun "me"
   his own ethereal essence. But at the time of the fulfilment of the
   prophecy, a new nature was to be added, consisting of a perfect man,
   corporeally and intellectually. To that adjunct nature---the man to be
   united to the God---the pronoun "him" was applied: "They shall look
   upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him." The
   viewless sword of the Lord of Hosts was to pervade the whole united
   spirituality of the incarnate Deity.

   The human piercers,. when "the spirit of grace and of supplications"
   should be poured into their hearts, would look upon the pierced God,
   and won-der, and repent, and adore; they would mourn for the pierced
   man with the same deep and affectionate mortal grief with which one
   "mourneth for his only son," and ",be in bitterness for him as one is
   in bitterness for his first-born." The human piercers, fiendish as was
   their intent, were but the instruments of infinite retribution. The
   efficient Piercer of the divine substitute for sinners was the Lord of
   Hosts.

CHAPTER XVIII.

   Scriptural Passages ascribing Blessedness to the Deity---If they are
   more than Doxologies, they imply no Incapacity to sustain Voluntary
   Suffering---Divine Beatitude progressive--- Joy set before" " the
   Author and Finisher of our Faith"@7---Holiness and happiness, though
   twin sisters, may be severed for a time.

   THE scriptural passages ascribing blessedness to the Deity will,
   doubtless, be invoked in favour of his impassibility. The following are
   samples of these passages: ",Blessed be the most high God." ---Genesis,
   14xiv. 20. " Blessed be the Lord God of Israel foreveri- and ever."---1
   l Chronicles, 16xvi. 36. " Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from
   everlasting to everlasting."---Psalm 41xli. 13. " Blessed be the Lord
   forever more."---Psalm 89lxxxix. 52. ",,Blessed be the King of Israel,
   that cometh in the name of the Lord."---Johbn, 12xii. 13. " And
   worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is
   blessed forever."---Romans, 1i. 25. " Of whom, as concerning the flesh,
   Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever."---Romans, 9ix. 5.
   ",Until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; which in his times he
   shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate."---1 l Timothy, 6vi.
   15. We believe these passages to be rather doxologies than declarations
   of doctrine; rather asceriptions of praise and thanksgiving to the
   Deity than averments of his infinite beatitude. So thought MacKnight,
   the learned annotator on the apostolic epistles. The passage which
   seems to approach nearer than, perhaps, any other in the whole Bible,
   to a declaration of the unchanging felicity of the Godhead from
   everlasting to everlasting, is that which we have just transcribed from
   the first chapter of Romans, where it is said that the heathen "
   worshipped a,ind served the creature more than the Creator, who is
   blessed forever." The learned annotator on the epistles, in his
   commentary on this passage, though himself a firm adherent of the
   prevalent theory, rendered the passage thus: "66 Worsh@ipped and served
   the creature rather than the Creator, who is to be praised forever."*
   But if any of the passages are to be regarded as declarations of the
   divine blessedness, they contain no affirmation or intimation that the
   beatitude of the Deity is fixed by a law paramount to his own
   volttition, so that a person of the Trinity has not capacity to become
   a voluntary sufferer.

   *MacKnight on the Epistles, vol. 1. p. 149.

   The ascriptions of blessedness in Scripture were often applied to
   Christ. It was of Christ that the apostle declared, " Who is over all,
   God blessed forever." It was of Jesus Christ that he again declared, "
   Who is the blessed and only Potentate." These asceriptions were
   applicable as well to his manhood as to his Godhead. They reached and
   pervaded both of his united natures. The united being , the whole
   Christ of the Bible, was styled "

   * MacKnight on the Epistles, vol. i. p. 149.

   the blessed and only Potentate." "The whole Christ was denominated,
   "God blessed forever." And yet this same united Being had just passed
   through the most terrible furnace of suffering ever lighted up on
   earth. If the ascriptions implied declarations of unchanged beatitude,
   and reached the past as well as the coming eternity, then Christ
   suffered not. His passion was but Oriental imagery. It was Christ,
   termed in the passage from the twelfth chapter of John " the King of
   Israel," on whom the epithet "blessed" was bestowed as he was entering
   Jerusalem to be crucified. If the passage was intended, not as a@ a
   mere hosanna, but a declaration of Christ's"s beatitude, it must have
   meant a beatitude of which he was capable of "emptying himself," when
   required by the good of the universe and the glory of the Godhead; for
   in a few hours afterward he voluntarily paid, by his own unimaginable
   sufferinags, the price of a worlrd's"s redemption.

   No direct affirmations of Scripture were neces. sary to demonstrate the
   beatitude of God. It results from the infinitude of his perfections. A
   Being of infinite power, knowledge, wisdom, holiness, justice, and
   goodness, has within himself infinite resources of felicity. But the
   felicity of the Deity is subject to his volition. He is not fated to
   the same unchangeable condition of blessedness whether he wills it or
   not. His beatitude is, like his glory, rather the emanation of his
   combined attributes than a distinct attribute of itself. Of his
   beattitude, as well as of his glory, the uncreated Son was capable of
   divesting himself for a time when he became a terrestrial sojourner in
   the flesh. His infinite power, and knowledge, and wisdom, and holiness,
   and justice, and goodness remained unchanged. But his glory and his
   beatitude he voluntarily cast aside for a brief season, that he might
   resume them again in increased and everlasting effulgence and
   perfection.

   Had the second person of the Trinity peremptorily declined to suffer
   when his suffering was prompted by the affections of his own benignant
   heart, sanctioned by his own unerring wisdom, and approved in the
   council of the Godhead, none on earth can gbe sure that his bliss might
   not have sustained a greater diminution from the absence than it has
   from the endurance of suffering" thus prompted, sanctioned, and
   approved., The a4ggrepgate of earthly happiness is measured by the span
   of human life; the aggregate of divine felicity is weighed in the
   balances of eternity. None on earth can say that the brief suffering of
   the second person of the Trinity in the flesh has not augmented the
   totalit@Iffy of his beatitude, when tested by the arithmetic of heaven.
   Had he reposed unmoved on his throne, and beheld, afar off, the smoke
   of the torment of the apostate pair, and of the countless generations
   of th eir descendants, ascending being up forever and ever, how can
   human reason venture to decide that, in the flight of endless ages, the
   eternity of his bliss might not have suffered more than it will have
   suffered from his mournful,. but short earthly pilgrimage?

   Reasoning pride has no grounds for concluding that the compassionate
   heart of our divine Redeemer might not have yearned unceasingly over
   the undistinguished perdition of a whole race, created by his own
   hands, in his own similitude, and seduced from unsuspecting innocence
   by the matchless wiles of one who had before beguiled from allegiance
   the third part of heaven. The ascending smoke would have been at once
   the memorial of a world destroyed, and the waving banner of his
   triumphant foe. Now has his divine and expiatory suffering bound that
   foe in everlasting chains, and proffered to every son and daughter of
   that world destroyed the healing and saving blood of his own most
   precious salvation. Now will the benignancy of infinite love forever
   overflow, and the pillars of infinite justice stand firm and sure as
   the foundations of the universe.

   We believe that the beatitude " of -the, Deity is progressive.
   Progression seems to be a governing principle, pervading the
   intellectualiminl, el ectual universe. Its As principle, pervading the
   int I" r e.

   display in man is palpable. Doubtless it pervades the angelic hosts.
   Why should it not reach the beatitude even of him who made progressive
   man in his own "image," and after his own ",likeness ?" We learn that
   the bliss of heaven is enhanced by the repentance of a single sinner on
   earth. Who will venture to presume that this enhancement of blessedness
   ascends not even to those who fill the celestial throne? That the glory
   of God is progressive, is a clear deduction from his own Holy Word. His
   beatitude is a sister emanation from the Godhead. Why, then, if one of
   the sacred sisters is found to be progressive, should the other be
   supposed to be stationary?

   Ere his creative power was first put forth, the triune God must have
   existed, the centre of his own untenanted eternity, in blest but
   solitary majesty. Worlds as yet were not, nor men nor angels; chaos
   filled the universal space. In the fulness of circling ages, the
   heavens were formed, perhaps the first---born of creation. Then earth,
   sun, stellar orbs, and doubtless systems unknown to telescopic vision,
   sprung into being, with all their countless dwellers. The chorus of ""
   the morning stars" was heard, I and the shouting "sons of God" returned
   their rapturous response. And think you that the benignant heart of the
   Creator, justly styled " the Sensorium of the universe"*"@- received no
   augmentation of bliss from the transports of his exulting creation? We
   view him not as the " cheerless and abstract Di"vini"ty" sometimes
   represented in " academic theology."" * t His is the infinite ocean of
   beatitude, capable nevertheless of receiving, without change of its
   identity, new accessions of delight from the gladdening streams which
   flow from perhaps every province, save one, of his boundless empire.

   *Ante page 53.

   *Ante page 52.

   It is a heaven-taught conclusion that the creations of God have
   enhanced his bliss. He beheld with satisfaction the wonders of his six"
   days'" lab hour, and repeatedly pronounced them to be very
   good.,--Genesis,, 1i. 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31. In thee

   * Ante page 53 f Ante page 52.

   sublimest of all the Psalms, which uninspired man could no more have
   composed than he could have formed a world, the royal David exclaimed,
   " The Lord shall rejoice in his works."--Psalms, 104eiv. 31. And the
   voice of later prophecy thus burst forth into rhapsody as it laboured
   to express his delight in the Church, " which he hath purchased with
   his own blood." " The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he
   will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his
   love, he will joy over thee with singing."--Zephaniah, 3iii. 17.

   We believe it deducible from Scripture, not only that the divine
   blessedness is progressive, but also that the beatitude of the
   uncreated Son will, in the reckoning of eternity, be immeasurably
   enhanced by his mediatorial sufferings and triumph. " Look ing unto
   Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who, for the joy that was
   set before him, enelidured the cross, despising the shame, and is set
   down at the right hand of the throne of God."--Hebretqpws, @,s, 12xii.
   2. This passage was, doubtless, applied to the redeeming man. We
   believe it to have been still more emphatically applied to the
   redeeming God., It was predicated of Jesus, that august Being who, in
   himself, uniiited a terrestrial atom to celestial infinity. It was
   predicated of him without limitation or exception. Its terms
   comprehended his divine ,as well as his human nature.

   The subject of the passage is farther distinguished as,, "the Author
   and Finisher of our faith." The human son of the Virgin was not the
   author of our faith; nor was he alone its finisher. The Author of our
   faith was the redeeming God. He became its Author by the covenant of
   redemption between him and the Father, ere the worlds were formed. Its
   finisher was the redeeming God and the redeeming man united; the God
   enacting the infinite, the man the finite part. It is impossible that
   Inspiration, unmindful of the predominating, the almost absorbing
   agency of the God, should have clothed the human son of the Virgin with
   the exclusive title of " the Author and Finisher of our faith!" He had
   no agenceyv in its authorship; he had not then himself come into being;
   he was only an humble adjunct in its consummation. Yet it was "the
   Author and Finisher of our faith" who had "66the joy"@l set befo&f6re
   him. The conclusion is inevitable that "61 the joy" must have been "
   set before" the redeeming God as well as the redeeming man.

   What was ",the joy that was set before" ",the Author and Finisher of
   our faith," the Bible has not informed us distinctly; we learn,
   however, that it was to be a new accession of "joy;"7 an augmentation
   of pre-existent beatitude. It was a "66joy"99 of magnitude Sufficient
   to move a God. It was a "joy" for which the Creator as well as the
   cCreature "endured the cross, despising the shame." A chief element in
   this Sacred "46joy" of the redeeming God is, doubtless, the hapd
   piniiess of the sons and daughters of salvation. They were destined to
   be eternal prisoners in the dungeons of despair; he transformed them
   into rejoicing saints around the throne of the Most High. Their
   happiness, purchased by his sufferings, is, no doubt, reflected back
   upon himself in unimaginable refulgence.

   "The quality of mniercy is not strained. Iit is twice blessed:

   It blesseth him that gives and him that takes."

   If this is true of an earthly philanthropist, how much deeper must be
   its truth when applied to the great Philanthropist of heaven! We may
   judge of his "joy" in the salvation of the redeemed, from his pity for
   their lost estate. His pity and his "joy" are alike beyond the
   comprehension of the cherubim and the seraphim. He views with
   complacency the material universe formed by his word; he regards with
   ineffable delight the moral creation brought into being by " the
   travail of his soul ;" pleasant to his hearing is the music of the
   circling spheres; rapturous to his heart is the anthem of praise and
   thanksgiving which ascends forever and ever from the mighty
   congregation of his redeemed children. Gethsemane and Calvary have
   yielded the brightest crown of glory to Him who "wears on his head many
   crowns." They have poured into his divine bosom a new river of "joy,"
   "clear as crystal," deep as the foundations of his throne, lasting as
   his eternity.

   The prevalent theory confidently infers the unchangeable beatitude of
   the eternal Son, as a self-evident and necessary conclusion from his
   immutable holiness. This conclusio n is said to be one of the intuitive
   perceptions of the theory. We admit that righteousness and happiness
   are indeed twin sisters, and that the pious mind must, from its views
   of divine justice, infebr the impoossibility of their permanent
   severance. But it cannot with truth infer that Omnipotence may not
   disjoin the twin sisters for a time, when their temporary severance is
   prompted by infinite wisdom and infin"i ite love. Scriptural history
   overrules such inference. The human son of the Virgin was at once the
   holiest and most afflicted of the children of humanity. In him holiness
   and suffering were com mingled from the manger cradle to the granite
   tomb. Holiness is, indeed, without sins of its own; but it may, and has
   vicariously borne the sins of others. If it suffered in the sinless
   man, why may it not have suffered in the pure essence of the indwelling
   God? The efficacious element in redeeming pain must needs be the
   holiness of the sufferer. It is a self-evident truism, that the
   substituted agonies of a sinful being could not have redeemed the
   world.

   Nor is the prevalent theory more correct in its suggestion, that, if
   the eternal Word suffered, his voluntary endurance, impelled by his own
   gracious and irrepressible emotions, must have been to him not grievous
   but joyous; and that, therefore, the very name of suffering, when
   applied to his spontaneous, triumphant, and exulting self-immolation,
   must have been -@lswal.lowed up in that of transport. This suggestion
   amounts to the proposition, that, what is pain in a sinful being, would
   be changed into joy, if voluntarily and piously endured by a being of
   perfect holiness. Test the proposition by applying -it to Mary's"s
   human son. His endurance was not by compulsion; he was not a passive
   machliine; he was a voluntary martyr; his submission to the terrible
   cup was free, according to his finite capacity, as that of the
   indwelling God. If, amidst his seeming sufferings, he suffered not in
   fact because he was pure; if, what would else have been the pains of
   Gethsemane and of Calvaryv, were transformed into raptures by his
   overcoming holiness, then the passion of Christ's"s humanity was but a
   delusive fiction;--then was there a transmutation into truth of the
   primitive heresy that the apparent agony of the redeeming man was but a
   pageant in the drama of salvation.

CHAPTER XIX.

   Immutability of God---Not Impugned by our Argumnient---Affected by
   Suffering no more than by lncarnation---ImpliUes only Identity of
   Essence and Primary Attributes--@lf God was InII-flexible as FPate,
   Prayer would be Useless, perhaps Impious---Immutability allows Mutation
   of Emotion and Action--Affirmed of Christ---Andcl yet Christ Suffered.

   IT would be doing great injustice to our argument to suppose that it
   seeks to impugn the unchangeableness of the Godhead. Immutability is
   one of the glorious attributes of the Deity. Amid all the varieties in
   the divine administration, a voice is still heard from the pavilion of
   the Highest, "I am the Lord: I change not."--Malachi, 3iii. 6.
   Sometimes, indeed, he appears the personification of mercy ; sometimes
   a "consuming fire." It is he who has breathed into the harps of heaven
   their joyous melody; "it is he who has lit up the quenchless
   conflagration of hell. God the Son is the Lamb slain. from the
   foundation of the world; he, too, is the Lion of the tribe of Judah.
   The voice that mourned over Jerusalem with more than a mother's"s
   tenderness will pronounce, in tones more astounding than ten thousand
   thunders, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
   for the devil and his angels." Nevertheless, his words and his acts,
   when duly understood, alike confirm. the proclamation, "I am the Lord:
   I change not." That in him " is no variableness, neither shadow of"
   turning," is written on the eternity of the past; it will glow in still
   brighter colours on the eternity of the future.--James, 1i. 17. ",,I AM
   THAT I AM" is forevermore his holy, and awful, and changeless name.

   If the imputation of suffering would cast a shade of changeableness
   upon him "14 w ho is over all, God blessed forever," so would his
   incarnation, in 9p the view of those who seek to survey that great
   event through the imperfect microscope of human reason. How stupendous
   the seeming change, when the ",Word was made flesh, and dwelt among
   us!" What greater change could mortal imagination conceive than the
   transition from the celestial throne to the manger of Bethlehem! The
   transformation wrought on the immutable God by his wondrous incarnation
   has filled even heaven with amazement. At the right hand of power, the
   angelic hierarchies once beheld the spiritual Essence of the second
   person of the Trinity ; they now behold there, with holy curiosity and
   wonder, the same spiritual Essence clothed in glorified human flesh,
   bearing, no doubt, on his hands and feet the marks of .the nails of the
   cross, and on his side the scar of the Roman spear. By the incarnation
   a total eclipse had passed over his glory; and then it passed away,
   leaving his glory still changed, but yet more glorious.

   To gain an adequate conception of the unchangeableness of the Godhead,
   the beholder must stand on an eminence high as heaven, and extend his
   comprehensive view along the illimitable tracts of eternity and
   immensity. Then will he find, in Ithe incarnation and sufferings of the
   eternal Son, 1the fulillest development of the immutability of the
   triune Deity ever revealed to mortal vision. Rather than change his
   unchangeable mercy, God the Son consented to become incarnate and
   suffer in his own divine essence, that sinners might be saved. Rather
   than change his unchangeable justice, God the Father " spared not his
   own Son, but delivered him up for us all." The incarnation and
   sufferings of God the Son were not caused by any change in the eternal
   counsels. The apostacy of man took not omniscience by surprise. It had
   been foreseen from the beginning. The earliest eternity had registered
   in its archives the advent and sufferings of the incarnate Deity, and
   his ascension and ceaseless reign at the right hand of the Highest. We
   might almost say that, before the worlds were formed, incarnation and
   suffering were incorporated into his very being among its constituent
   elements. Had God the Son not been laid in the manger of Bethlehem; had
   God the Son not "endured the cross;" had the cup passed from God the
   Son, as he for a moment so pathetically supplicated, unchangeableness
   must have been forever plucked from the glorious constellation of the
   attributes of the Godhead.

   His temporary suffering affected, no more than did his incarnation, the
   immutability of the second person of the Trinity. The God "emptied" of
   his beatitude for voluntary suffering, lost not his identity any more
   than did the God " emptied" of his glory for voluntary incarnation. The
   objection, that, if the uncreated Word suffered on earth, he must, to
   maintain his eternal unchangeableness have suffered from the beginning,
   is of no greater avail than would be the objection that, he must have
   been incarnate from the beginning because he became incarnate on earth.

   Suffering wrought no change in the decrees or purposes of the redeeming
   God. If it effected any change, it must, then, have been either in his
   essen,ce or in his attributes. That suffering cannot change the essence
   of spiritual beings, is an awful truth deducible from the revealed
   history of the universe, past and prospective. The suffering God, then,
   remained identical in essence with the creating God. Nor did suffering
   change any of his glorious and fixed attributes. His justice, holiness,
   power, wisdom, truth, immutability, and love never shone so
   coonspicuousligy nor@ harmbtr@ioniouslyudy as when, made sin for
   sinners, he meekly submitted himself, in all hiMs omnipotence, to the
   avenging sword of the Lord of Hosts. Even from the cross the ear of
   faith might have caug-&hti the still, deep whisper, unheard by
   carnaledra@l earts, "I am the Lord: I change not."

   Had God been inflexible as the imaginary fate of heathen mythology,
   prayer would be useless,r,, perhaps impious; for it would seek, by
   creature importunity, to move the Immoveable. But the God "of the Bible
   is the hearer and answerer of prayer.. "The effectual fervent prayer of
   a righteous man availeth much." To the prayers of Elias the rains of
   heaven were made obedient.--- James, 5v. 16, 17. Present death was
   denounced against Hezekiah; yet the earnest prayer of the pious king
   had efficacy to

   "Roll back the flood of never-ebbing time,"

   and add fifteen years to the span of his life. 2 Kings, 20xx. 1-1 1. At
   the prayer of Moses, ",the Lord repented of the evil which he thought
   to do unto his people."--Exodus, 32xxxii. 14. When the penitent cry of
   Nineveh was wafted towards heaven, " God saw their works that they
   turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had
   said he would do unto them, and he did it not."--Jonah, 3iii. 10.

   But amid all these seeming changes in the purposes of the Almighty, he
   is still the unchanging God, " with whom is no variableness, neither
   shadow of turning." To hear and answer the prayers of the faithful was
   a part of his eternal counsels, forming a ,constituent element of the
   Godhead ere the worlds were a,created. His patient hearing and gracious
   answering of prayer, in every age and every place, is, to fallen
   creatures, the most consolatory development of divine immutability.
   Should he cease to be the paternal hearer and answerer of prayer, he
   would cease to be himself. He would become thenceforth the changed,
   instead of the unchangeable God.

   The very perfection and immutability of God's"s attributes induce
   mutations in his feelings and actions. A being of infinite and
   unchanging poweri, wisdom, holiness, goodness, justice and truth, must
   needs have felt and acted differently towards the persecuting Saul of
   Tarsus, and Paul, the devoted, the exulting martyr. Upon the rebellious
   and fallen angels, now monuments of "his righteous and unpitying wrath,
   the light of God's"s countenance once beamed, perhaps, as benignly as
   on his own faithful Gabriel. From everlasting to everlasting the
   glorious attributes of the Deity continue in unvarying perfection. But
   in a universe where sin has entered; where created intelligences abound
   with volitions "free as air;" where the principle of good and the
   principle of evil contend for mastery with varying success, he " who
   sitteth in the heavens" is of necessity led, by the immutability of his
   own infinite perfections, to mutation of emotion, and consequent
   mutation of action. Yet is there no real change in the unchanging God.
   His mutations are but the developments of his unalterable perfections.
   Their most astonishing development was the sacrifice of his own
   uncreated Son, to save our sinful and perishing world. The descending
   sword of the Lord of Hosts, awakened to smite his other self, was the
   crowning demonstration of divine immutability.

   The position, so confidently maintained by the advocates of the
   prevalent theory, that, if a person of the Trinity were to suffersufrer
   for a time, he must, to preserve his unchangeableness, suffer from
   everlasting to everlasting, has less affinity to the philosophy of the
   Bible, than to that of the classic voluptuary of heathen Athens.
   Epicurus thus spoke of his imagined and iron-bound divinity: ," The
   Deity could neither be influenced by favour nor resentment, because
   such a being must be weak and frail ; and all fear of the power and
   anger of God should be banished, because anger and affection are
   inconsistent with his immutable nature."

   What an ally did the Epicurean faith unexpectedly find in the dominant
   theory of Christendom! The god of the Attic libertine could not have
   become angry without becoming mutable; the God of the prevalent theory
   must have stooped to the like mutability had he voluntarily suffered! 1
   It follows as a necessary corollary of the classic dogma, that if its
   god, from some turn of destiny should once become incensed, he must
   remain incensed for endless ages. The prevalent theory, if correct,
   would confirm the dogma of Epicurus and its necessary corollary. If the
   supposition of vicarious and short-lived suffering by the everlasting
   Son would of necessity imply his eternal suffering, why does not the
   revealed truth that the infinite Father "is angry with the wicked every
   day" necessarily imply the everlasting continuance of his wrath, though
   rivers penitent tears, purified ceaselessly flow from their weeping
   eyes and broken hearts? ? If the suffering God of to-day must suffer
   for ever, or become mutable, why must not the angry God of to-day
   remain angry forever or forfeit his perfection of unchangeableness ?
   And yet the immoveability predicated of the divine nature by the
   Epicurean philosophy, would, if applied to the Jehovah of sinners,
   wrest fr@om him the vital element of their hope---even his
   prayer--hearing and prayer--answering attribute.

   The God of Christians resembles not the mM" arble idol of the classic
   voluptuary. The Sacred Volume indeed, teaches that his primary
   attributes are without change. Perhaps even the Almighty himself could
   not change them without impugning the immutable laws of his being. Such
   are his omnipotence; his wisdom ; his holiness; his justice ; his
   truth; his goodness. It is the permanent identity of these, and of his
   essence, that constitutes the immutability of the great I AM. We do
   not, however, understand that the scriptural vocabulary has classed his
   glory and his beatitude among his primary and inflexible attributes.
   The Bible clearly reveals that his glory was subject to his volition.
   God, the Son, divested himself of it when he became incarnate; he
   deeply felt the bereavement, and prayed for restoration to his prim "
   evail-state.---John,i 17xvii. 5. There is no intimation in the Sacred
   Oracles, that the beatitude of God is not also subject to his volition.
   It is the arrogance of human reason, and not the Bible, that would
   chain the Omnipotent tSo ceaseless bliss, whether he wills it or not.
   Coerced happiness would, perhaps, be but misery in disguise.
   Philanthropy, urged by its own benign impulses to suffer in some high
   and holy cause, might endure more from involuntary restraint than from
   voluntary suffering. We believe it essential to the perfection of
   God's"s blessedness that it should depend, rather on his own sovereign
   choice, than on an inflexible destiny that overrules even his own
   almightiness. If the Bible were allowed to speak for itself---if we
   were permitted to open our souls to the free reception of its sacred
   testimonials---the conclusion would appear to be inevitable, that the
   eternal Son, when he became incarnate, " emptied himself" of his
   beatitude as well as of his glory.

   The following passage seems demonstrative that temporary suffering,
   voluntarily incurred, is not incompatible with the attribute of divine
   immutability,--@,, " Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and
   forever."---Hebrews, 13xiii. 8. The term " yesterday"s wasg not
   literally confined by the apostle to the day preceding that on which
   the inspired passage was pennoured ; it reached back to the epoch of
   the incarnation, when the . person of the Mediator was first and
   unchangeably constituted by the union of his divine and human natures.
   The text, then, contains the proposition that from the moment of the
   holy union of the God and the man down to the date of the epistle to
   the Hebrews, Jesus Christ had been the same, and that he was to remain
   the same forevermore. Thus the attribute of unchangeableness was
   predicated of Jesus Christ as unequivocally as the Jehovah of the Old
   Testament affirmed it of himself when he declared, " I am the Lord ; I
   change not," or as St. James affirmed it of the " Father of lights,
   with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning."

   Jesus Christ was the same in his manger cradle as when be ascended in
   triumph to the bosom of his heavenly Parent. True, he had "increased in
   wisdom and stature;" but such physical advancement changed him not.
   True, he had been covered " with light as with a garment" on the mount,
   and in the garden with great drops of exuded blood ",falling down to
   the ground;" but such vicissitudes changed not the changeless Christ.
   True, he had suffered beyond what man or angel could have endured; but
   temporary agony wrought no change in any of the elements which
   constituted his sameness. He who hung on the cross forsaken of his
   Father, was identical in every attribute of his being with him who will
   come in the clouds to judge the world in righteousness, accompanied
   with all that heaven can furnish of the magnificent, the awful, the
   sublime. Holy immutability may voluntarily suffer for a time without
   losing its essential unchangeableness; else the epistle to the Hebrews
   would not have affirmed of the humbled, suffering, dying, risen,
   glorified, ever blessed Jesus Christ, that he was " the same yesterday,
   and today, and forever.".

CHAPTER XX.

   Incarnation no Proof that God the Son had not Capacity to suffer
   without it---Probable Reasons of Incarnation---It presented Example of
   perfect Man---Brought Proofs of Gospel home to Senses of Men---Rendered
   Triumph over Satan complete-- Affords abiding Memorial of God's"s
   Justice and Love---Incarnate God, in both his Nature,.3, obeyed the
   Law.

   LET it not be objected, because the redeeming God took on him the
   "body" that was prepared for him, and became flesh and blood with "the
   children" "he came to save, that therefore the assumption of manhood
   was needful to enable Omnipotence to suffer.---Heb. 2ii. 14; 10x. 5.
   Whence does the prevalent hypothesis derive this objection ? Not from
   the Holy Ghost. In the Volume of Inspired Truth not a sentence is to be
   found intimating that destiny has surrounded the sphere of suffering
   with a barrier which the Almighty cannot overleap, even if he wills to
   pass it. It is the presumptuous objection of reasoning pride. The
   investiture of manhood was selected because it was deemed by infinite
   wisdom the most appropriate habiliment for the Saviour of our sinking
   race. It was selected as the suffering costume most becoming the
   redeeming God. Even our finite faculties can perceive many reasons why
   he should suffer in the fallen nature he came to save. We would
   venture, with profound reverence, to suggest some of the considerations
   which may possibly have commended the garb of flesh to the self-devoted
   Deity.

   First. Had he suffered in the nature obf angels, or in his own
   incorporeal essence, he might, indeed, have rendered an equivalent for
   the debts of the redeemed to the celestial treasury ; but the
   satisfaction of their debts was not the sole object of his mediatorial
   mission. He came to rescue them, not only from the penalty, but also
   from the power of sin. He came, not only to save them from hell, but to
   prepare them for heaven. He came to breathe into them a. portion of his
   own holiness; to lure them upward by his own glorious example; to make
   them, by his precepts and pattern, "meet to be partakers of the
   inheritance of the saints in light." "--7-Colossians, 1i. 12. To render
   his example efficacious, it must needs have been imitable. The children
   of humanity could not have imitated the unshro6uded God. They cCould
   not even have seen him and live6d.---Exodus, 33xxxiii. 20.- To make his
   example imitable by man, he must of necessity have assumed the form of
   a man; wherefore, " the Word was made flesh."---John, 1i. 14. "
   Wherefore in all things it became him to be made like unto his
   bretbren."--@Hebrews, 2ii. 17.

   Secondly. The incarnation was necessary to secrure, on earth, credence
   for the Gospel. Man is, by nature, a skeptical animal. The unbelieving
   Thomas was a sample of the fallen race. Had the proofs of the miracle
   of redeeming love been less palpable and cogent, it could not have
   obtained the belief of those for whose salvation it was intended. If
   the angel, instead of announcing to the shepherds of Bethlehem the
   physical birth of a Saviour in the cityf of David, had proclaimed that
   the second person of the Trinity had redeemed our apostate race by
   suffering for them in his original essence, in the celestial court, "
   high and lifted up" above mortal ken, the messenger from heaven would
   have obtained few converts on earth.

   To make incredulous man a believer in the stupendous scheme of
   redemption, sensible demonstrations were indispensable. Proofs must be
   accumulated on proofs. The prophetic harp must detail in advance the
   anticipated biography of the comrning Messiah. The Messiah must be
   born, and live, and die, in exact fulfilment of ancient predicti" Ion.
   Miracles must be wrought. The wondrous star; the descending dove; the
   audible voice from the clouds; the transfiguration on the mount; the
   multiplication of the five barley loaves and two small fishes into
   abounding aliment for a famished host; the obeying elements; the
   submissive devils; the healing of the sick; the raising of the dead;
   his crucifixion, with its darkened sun, and rent rocks, and trembling
   earth; his resurrection; his visibleI I I ascension, were all required
   to convince an unbelieving world that the Son of God suffered and died
   for its redemption. This mighty mass of proof would not have been
   accumulated had less sufficed. Heaven is never prodigal of display.

   The feeble, hesitating, reluctant faith of man required to be confirmed
   by appeals to all his senses. The word of the God could not have
   overcome the stubbornness of incredulity. To gain from his creatures
   their reluctant belief, the Creator was obliged to become incarnate.
   Had he not become incarnate, and re-enforced, too, his appeals by a
   succession of stupendous miracles, he could not have made proselytes,
   even of his twelve disciples. Their faith, indeed, required for its
   aliment, not only that they should see with their eyes, but also that
   they should handle with their hands, of the Word of life.---1 I John,
   1i. 1I. As it was, one of them betrayed him, and another denied him,
   and all of them fled from him in his darkened hour. Even as it now is,
   infidelity boldly stalks the earth, polluting with its foul breath the
   pure air of heaven. Even as it now is, the regenerated, the sanctified,
   the redeemed children of humanity are, in this life, but half
   believers.

   Thirdly. The incarnation of the redeeming God rendered more complete
   and manifest his triumph over the arch enemy. Even frail reason may
   perceive the fitness of the provision, that he who bruised the
   serpent's"s head should have first assumed the seed of the woman ; that
   his victory over the powers of darkness should have been achieved in
   the very world, and in the very nature which they had seduced from
   allegiance. This consideration, doubtless, helps to swell the
   exultation of heaven. This is, no doubt, the scorpion sting in the core
   of the hearts of the baffled princedoms reserved in chains -of darkness
   in the prison-house of despair.

   Fourthly. The incarnation has afforded an imperishable memorial of the
   greatest event which the flight of never-beginning ages has beheld. In
   the lapse oof the eternity to come, Gethsemane and Calvary might,
   without this memorial, have faded in the recollection of created
   intelligences. Frail is the memory of even redeemed man. Less than
   infinite is the memory of the cherubim and the seraphim. But an
   everlasting monument of the struggles and the triumph of redeeming love
   has been fixed by the incarnation in the most conspicuous station of
   the universe. The redeeming God carried with him to heaven the body in
   which he had suffered on earth, and placed it at the right hand of the
   Highest. There that pierced body forever remains, its scars betokening
   less the lacerations of the visible irons than the unseen wounds
   inflicted on the uncreated Spirit of his divine Son by the viewless
   sword of the Lord of Hosts. With this ever-livingcr memorial, occupying
   the central point of the " universal empire, it is impossible that the
   recollection of the garden and the cross, with all their thrilling
   associations, should ever be dimmed by the course of ceaseless ages.

   Should the harp of the weakest saint allowed to enter the New Jerusalem
   falter for a moment, he has but to cast his eye on the right-hand seat
   of the celestial throne, and those speaking scars must at once renovate
   his love and his zeal. Should ambition a second time insinuate itself
   into the angelic ranks, its aspiration must be checked and extinguished
   by a single glance at the right-hand seat of the celestial throne. That
   pierced body is an abiding memento of the awful truth that, sooner than
   leave sin unpunished, the eternial Father spared not his own eternal
   Son. It is a demonstration of the inflexibility of God's"s wrath
   against transgressions, infinitely more impressive than the smoke which
   ascends for ever and ever from the pit of despair. Those warning scars
   symbolizing the expiatory anguish of the suffering Deity,, are an
   everlasting beacon to guard the angelic hosts against the incipient
   movements of forbidden desire.

   Fifthly. The, redeeming God was to obey the law. It was the dishonour
   done to the law which

   "Brought death into the world, and all our wo."

   Our great Deliverer was to restore its tarnished honour, not only by
   paying its penalty, but also by perfect obedience to its precepts. To
   make the obedience perfect, and availing, and palpable to created
   intelligences, incarnation was required. It was needful, not merely
   that the Word should be made flesh, but likewise that he should dwell
   among us. The obedience of the incarnate God was not in his human
   capacity alone. Both his natures concurred in the obedience. The God,
   as well as the man, obeyed the law. This is the inevitable conclusion
   from the language of Scripture.

   The man was a glorious and beautiful specimen of what our race would
   have been had they retained their affinity to heaven. Even the chilled
   eye of atheism must be sometimes inclined to melt as it gazes on such a
   lovely personification of moral excellence. That a creature so pure,
   warned by the example of the first Adam, sustained by the consciousness
   of indwelling divinity, animated by "the joy set before him," should
   have yielded perfect obedience to a law, the counterpart of himself" in
   holiness, was an event not likely to excite "special wonder." But the
   Bible speaks of the obedience of the incarnate God as a very
   extraordinary event. The Bible must, therefore, have referred to the
   obedience of the second person of the Trinity. That was "the acme of
   wonder. For him to become obedient on earth, who had from everlasting
   been accustomed to sSupreme command in heaven, was indeed a phenomenon
   of gracious condescension well calculated to create astonishment in
   this world and in the world above.

   The law obeyed by the incarnate God had three branches: the ceremonial
   code of the Jews; the code promulged at Sinai; and the mediatorial
   code., formed by the covenant of redemption, between the Father and the
   Son, in early eternity. The incarnate God obeyed to the letter the
   Jewish ceremonial code. He was circumcised on the eighth day. Jerusalem
   and all Judea went out to be baptized of John. In conformity with this
   prevalent usage of his nation, the incarnate God was baptized by his
   conscious and hesitating servant. The visible dove "and the audible
   voice demonstrated that he who caused Jordan to flow was, in very
   truth, the recipient of its. baptismal waters.

   290 MEDIATORIAL CODE.

   The incarnate God obeyed the law promulged at Sinai. " Think not that I
   am come to destroy the law and the prophets; I am not come to destroy,
   but to fulfil."---Matthew, 5v. 17. ",For as by one man's"s disobedience
   many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one many shall be made
   righteous."---Romans, 5v. 19.

   But the principal code to be obeyed by the incarnate God was the
   mediatorial code. This was emphatically the code of the Godhead. Two .
   of the Sacred Three ordained it, ages before the birth of the infant
   Jesus. The second- of the Sacred Three was to be its self-devoted, its
   obedient subject. The man was, no doubt, to obey it, according to the
   measure of his very limited capacity. But in the article of merit the
   obedience of the man bore no greater proportion to the obedience of the
   God than the finite bears to the infinite. The principal ingredient in
   the mediatorial code, was its demand for expiatory suffering. It may be
   styled in the suffering code. Of this suffering co@12-1-i@hde God the
   Son was one of thile legislators ; of this suffering code God the Son,
   clothed in flesh, was to be the victim. Here was a spectacle of blended
   justice, love, and disinterestedness upon which, to eternity, the
   universe may gaze without satiety!

   It was, indeed, a code of terrible exaction. Its penalty, if
   concentrated within a space shorter than eternity, could not have been
   endured by the united energies of created intelligences. We believe
   that nothing but an uncreated and almighty God could have borne it. The
   obedience of God the Son to this penal code is " demonstration strong,"
   not only of his capacity to suffer, but of I his actual suffering. To
   this code he " who, be" ing in the form of God, thought it not robbery
   to be equal with God," " became obedient unto death." ---Philippians,
   2ii. 8. " Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
   which he suffered; and being made perfect he became the author of
   eternal salvation unto all them that obey himhirn."---Hebrews, 5v. 8,
   9. The ",Son" indicated by the writer to the Hebrews was not the human
   son of the Virgin, but God's"s " own SoniY" clothed in flesh; for he
   alone was " the author of eternal salvation." It was God's"s " own
   Son," then, who, veiled in humanity, learned " obedience" and was "66
   made perfect" " by the things which be suffered." The obedient and
   suffering Son of this passage was the Son, as the same writer to the
   Hebrews declared, by whom the infinite Father made the worlds, and who
   was " the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
   person."---Hebrews, 1. 2, ,3.

   The suffering of the uncreated Son did not render superfluous the
   suffering of the adjunct man. In the early age of the Christian
   church---that prolific foundry of airy theories---the opinion at one
   time prevailed, to some extent, that the manhood of Christ suffered in
   appearance only. This heresy was, however, of short duration. It is
   not, indeed, conceivable that an incarnate Deity should suffer in his
   divinity without imparting suffering to the clay tenement in which he
   is enshrined.

   292 SUFIFIERING OF THE MAN.

   But, without discussing the doctrine of possibilities when applied to
   the Omni potent, it is enough for us to say that the blessed
   incarnation of the Bible would have failed in some of its apparent
   objects had the adjunct man remained in a condition of untouched
   felicity. No imitable example would have been left to the suffering
   faithful as a pattern of meekness and patience. The sufferings of the
   redeeming Deity were unseen; they pertained to his unsearchable
   divinity; we can but imagine them dimly even when contemplated through
   the telescope of faith; humanity, lost in wonder and adoration, cannot
   aspire to imitate them. Had the redeeming agonies been limited to the
   shrouded Jehovah, there would have been no visible representation to
   shadow them forth on earth and perpetuate their remembrance in heaven.
   No bloody sweat, no speaking scars would have symbolized the viewless
   pangs of the redeeming God. How could the man have participated with
   the kindred Deity in his exaltation, unless he had participated with
   him in his sufferings. The man, as well as the enshrined Divinity, "
   for the joy set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and
   is now set down at the right hand of the throne of God."---Hebrews,
   12xii. 2.

   OBJECTIONS TO THEORY. 293

CHAPTER XXI.

   Objections to Prevalent Theory--Venerable for its Age and Prevalence--
   Miniature of its Outlines--Derogates from Simplicity and Fulness of
   Atonement--Not founded on Scripture--Imparts to Bible Figurative
   Meaning--Lowers affection from Godhead of Christ to
   Manhood---Strengthens Unitarian Error.

   WE have now reached the point where it becomes necessary, in the
   progress of our argument, to attempt a more detailed examination of the
   prevalent theory than we have hitherto done. This is a delicate branch
   of our subject. We would not willingly aid in the demolition of a
   material edifice, venerable for its age, and consecrated as the scene
   of memorable events, however much we might complain of its
   architectural proportions. With how much propounder regret do we enter,
   with hostile purpose, that spiritual structure, which has exten " ded
   over continents its vast dimensions, and grown gray under the frosts of
   almost fifteen hundred years ! Ever since its erection, it has been the
   abode of the chief portion of the piety of Christendom. In its many
   chambers devotion has for ages uttered her dying prayers, and breathed
   forth her last faltering accents. From its lofty turrets, for near
   fifteen centuries, have triumphantly ascended joyous groups of "the
   spirits of just men made perfect."

   That the corner-stone of this stupendous structure has been laid in
   error, is engraved on the tablet of our heart, as it were, by a pen of
   iron on tablets of marble. With the absorbing belief resting on our
   soul that the second person of the Trinity suffered and died, in his
   ethereal essence, for the redemption of our race, we cannot withhold
   from this sublimest of truths the aid of our feeble voice, even were we
   to stand alone with a world opposed. Religious misconception is not
   changed into truth by its prevalence or age. If errors of faith could
   be consecrated by their universality or antiquity, then might the
   paganism of China interpose against the missionaries of the Cross a
   rampart more impregnable than her celebrated wall interposed to Tartar
   incursions.

   The following is a miniature representation of the prevalent theory: It
   affirms that the second person of the Trinity, the incarnate Redeemer
   of the world, suffered and died, not in h]is divine nature, which is
   impassible, but in his human nature only: that by virtue of the union
   of his divine and human natures, called the hypostatic union, there was
   imparted to his human sufferings and death a value and dignity which
   made them, in the estimation of infinite justice, and in pursuance of
   the covenant of grace between the Father and the Son, an adequate
   atonement for the sins of the redeemed. This, though a brief, is
   believed to be a faithful sketch of the prevalent theory.

   To this theory are opposed serious objections, some of which have
   already been intimated.

   295

   First. The theory derogates from the simplicity and fulness of the
   atonement, and imparts to it an illusive character. It subtracts from
   the atonement its vital principle. It robs it of its suffering, dying
   God. It substitutes the sufferings and decath of the creature for the
   sufferings and death of the Creator. That the human son of the Virgin
   was a creature---as really so as Peter or John ---the advocates of the
   prevalent theory will not deny. Nor will they affirm that mere creature
   sufferings could have atoned for the sins of man. For then Gabriel,
   il"nistead of the eternal Son, might have been the incarnate redeemer
   of the world. But the prevalent theory would seek to imbue the
   sufferings of the creature with a borrowed value, reflected from the
   Creator dwelling within. How the indwelling God could impart atoning
   value to creature sufferings, in which he did not himself participate,
   but from which he stood dissevered by the immutable laws of his being,
   none of the faculties of man, save his imagination, can shadow forth.
   Sufferings, valueless as an atoning offering in themselves, could not
   have derived atoning merits from the mere juxtaposition of indwelling
   divinity.

   The intrinsic worth of a habitation would not be enhanced by the rank
   of its occupant. Human vanity might, indeed, attach to an edifice,
   proffered in satisfaction of a debt, a fictitious value, from its
   having been tenanted by a prince; but the calculations of human vanity
   would not have affected Him, who must have weighed earth'ws supposed of

   ********offering for sin in the balance of the sanctuary, in the face
   of the intelligent universe. The Holder of the everlasting scales
   would, we suppose, have fixed the value of the offered tabernacle of
   clay from the intrinsic worth of its terrestrial materials, little
   moved by the consideration that the "Prince of life" was its tenant,
   and the poor oblation for a ruined world must have had written over
   against it the superscription so astounding to the aspiring Oriental
   despot, "Thou art weighed in the bal,17. ances, and art found wanting."

   The supposition that the chief office of the second person of the
   Trinity in the work of redemption was to impart, by his holy
   incarnation, dignity and value to creature suffiterings, is the
   imagination of the prevalent theory. Had the communication of dignity
   and value to creature sufferings been the chief object of the
   incarnation, it must have been somewhere intimated in the Word of God.
   It would have formed too important -a featu0are in the . scheme of
   salvation to have escaped special notice. The silence of the Bible is a
   speaking silence. But the object of the holy incarnation is not left to
   be deduced by inference. The Bible everywhere indicates, in terms
   seemingly unequivocal, that the mission of the redeeming God was a
   suffering mission, and that its chief Actor was himself the princ.
   (-,ipal Sufferer.

   The human son of the Virgin was doubtless immeasurably exalted by his
   union with the Godhead. Even the ordinary Christian derives from his
   relationship to God a dignity far surpassing all that earth can confer.
   The humblest saint who drives his "team afield" may look down, as from
   a celestial height, on the diminished glories of a Solon or a Caæoosar
   ; for he is,, "the temple of the Holy Ghost." How much greater was the
   exaltation of the human son of Mary! Yet was hbe but a creature. His
   elevation to the throne of the Highest added not a fourth person to the
   Godhead. His sufferings were but creature sufferings. Nothing, save an
   infinite atonement, could have satisfied the requisitions of an
   infinite law, trampled under foot in the face of the universe. The
   vicarious suffeiaring of an insect of the field, and the vicarious
   sufferings of legions of angels would have been alike inefficadcious.
   To impart infinitude to creature sufferings, infinite duration is
   necessary. They can be swelled into infinity only by the ceaseless tide
   of eternal ages. Christ himself always assigned to his manhood a finite
   and inferior rank, notwithstanding its union with the Godhead. Evidence
   of this truth abounds in his declarations. We need here cite no
   particular texts to prove it. Some of them appear elsewhere in these
   pages. His manhood had no attribute of infinity. If, then, the manhood
   of Christ held only a finite rank, notwithstanding its union with the
   Godhead, how can the prevalent theory venture to assign an infinite
   rank to the exclusive sufferings of that manhood? The sufferings of his
   mere manhood could not rank higher than the manhood itself. If his
   manhood derived not infinity from union with the God, such union could
   not impart infinity to the sufferings of that manhood. If the union of
   the God took not away from Christ's"s humanity its creature character,
   neither could it have taken away from the sufferings of that humanityv
   their creature character. As, then, the indwelling God infused nothing
   of infinitude into the manhood of Christ, so he infused nothing of
   infinitude into his sufferings. The imputation of infinite value to
   finite sufferings, because of the indwelling of an infinit" e Being, to
   whom the sufferings, however, were not communicated or communicable,
   should, to gain credence, be sustained by clear scriptural proofs.

   The prevalent theory subtracts from the atonement of the Bible, not
   only its infinitude, but also its ineffable dignity. This thought has
   been partially developed in an early part of our argument; but its
   importance seemed to require its farther expansion in this connexion.

   Meeting full in the face the very numerous passages of Scripture
   ascribing sufferings to the divinity of Christ in terms not to be
   parried, the prevalent theory, to avoid too palpable a collision with
   Holy Writ, was obliged to allege that, by the hby postatic union of the
   divine and human natures in one person, the sufferings of the man
   became, in scriptural estimation, the sufferings of the God, not by
   actual endurance, but by adoption or construction. These are the views
   expressed, as we have seen, by Bishops Pearson and Beveridge; and
   without some such aliment, the hypostatic theory could not have
   subsisted. The redeeming God, then, is to be taken as the principal
   redeeming sufferer, constructively, according to the prevalent theory,
   actually, according to ours. As it regards its bearing on this
   particular point of our argument, it is not material whether his
   suffering was actual or constructive. It is enough for the present
   point, that in scriptural estimation the God suffered ; that the
   suffering is predicated of him who hath "weighed the mountains in
   scales, and the hills in a balance."---Isaiah, 40xl. 12.

   Suffering consists in the reduction of what would otherwise have been
   the happiness of the sufferer. The amount of the reduction tells the
   amount of the suffering. The happiness of the incarnate God, but for
   his suffering, would have been infinite. He imbodied the fulness of the
   beatitude of the Godhead. According to the prevalent theory, hiMs
   suffering was finite. It reached his humanity alone. It was only the
   suffering of the finite man. It touched but the outer garment of the
   indwelling God. Subtract finite suffering from infinite beati tude, and
   the reduction must be too small for creature perception. It would
   elude, by its minuteness, the arithmetic of earth, and, as we suppose,
   the arithmetic of angels.

   If you take a drop from the bucket and a drop from the ocean, the loss
   of the bucket will be incomparably greater than the loss of the
   illimitable sea; for its capacity to lose "with impunity is
   proportionally less than the capacity of the ocean. Christ, if his
   divinity tasted not " the cup of trembling," was happier even in the
   garden and on the cross than any created intelligence to be found in
   this lower world or in the heavens above. His was the ocean of divine
   blessedness. The subtraction of the drop of human wo caused a less
   diminution than would be caused to an ocean of earth by the subtraction
   of a single drop of its "multitudinous" waters; for the oceans of earth
   have their shores; the ocean of divine blessedness is shoreless. Thus
   the prevalent theory would sink those expiatory sufferings, which
   satisfied the divine law and redeemed the world, from their scriptural
   infinitude down to a point less, taken in reference to the illimitable
   beatitude of the sufferer, than a single particle of the dust of the
   balance. "Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of
   Ascalon," lest the spiritually uncircumcised should rejoice.

   Secondly. The prevalent theory with its hypostatic subordinate, has not
   its foundation in the Word of God. According to the scriptural
   representation, the redeeming sufferer appeared, not as a secondary
   planet, borrowing light and lustre from a central sun; he was himself
   the central Sun of his own system of grace, shining in his own
   brightness. He was not the outer man, deriving dignity from the
   impassible God within; he was the suffering God, wearing the form of
   the outer man, but as the sinless representative of the fallen nature
   he came to save. The Bible everywhere gives to the redeeming sufferer
   the primary, and not the secondary place. On the scriptural canvass,
   the redeeming God is always depicted as the principal Sufferer. It was
   the "Prince of life" who was "killed;" it was the "Lord of glory" who
   was "crucified;" it was the Son of man "that came down from heaven" who
   gave "his life a ransom for many;" it was the shepherd God who laid
   down his "life for the sheep;" it was God's "only-begotten Son" whom he
   "sent into the world" "to be the propitiation for our sins;" it was the
   uncreated Son by whose "death" we were reconciled to God; it was the
   Father's "own Son" whom he "spared not;" it was "the brightness of his
   glory, and the express image of his person," who "purged our sins;" it
   was God who "laid down his life for us;" it was with the blood of God
   that he purchased his Church; it was to smite his "Fellow" that the
   Lord of Hosts awakened his slumbering sword; it was He that "thought it
   not robbery to be equal with God," who "emptied himself," and "became
   obedient unto death;" it was the "Alpha and Omega," who "was dead and
   is alive again," and behold, he liveth forevermore. From Genesis to
   Revelation, both inclusive, there is no text, within our recollection,
   intimating that "the Word was made flesh" merely to impart dignity and
   value to creature sufferings. The hypostatic scheme is too complicated,
   too involved, too artificial for gospel simplicity and directness. It
   bears the marks of the chisel of art. It has been formed in the
   laboratories of earth.

   Was strength for the endurance of creature sufferings needed? That
   strength might have been imparted to the human son of the Virgin by the
   mere mandate of the God. The mandate of almighty God is wide-reaching
   and resistless. He commanded, and there was light. He spake, and from
   the opening east appeared the king of day, rejoicing in his might. He
   commanded, and straightway began the ceaseless dance of the harmonious
   spheres. His mandate was the chariot of fire in which the translated
   Elijah ascended to heaven. It was his mandate which closed the mouths
   of the famished lions, so that they harmed not the faithful prophet.
   His mandate opened the fountain of waters above, and the depths below,
   so that a mighty deluge overflowed the mountains of the earth. His
   mandate will one day melt with fervent heat the elements of the
   material universe. His mandate, without his becoming incarnate, might,
   doubtless, have imparted all needful strength to the human son of the
   Virgin.

   If, then, God was made "manifest in the flesh," not to strengthen his
   terrestrial adjunct, or merely to impart dignity and value to creature
   sufferings, what could have been the object of his incarnation?
   Scripture has intimated no other object--imagination can conceive no
   other--than the redemption of the world and the manifestation of
   infinite justice by suffering in his own divine essence. This is the
   grand central point in the system of salvation, to which we are drawn
   from all our wanderings by the centripetal attraction of almighty
   truth.

   An infinite object, of a twofold aspect, was presented to the conclave
   of the Godhead. A world was to be saved. Divine justice was to be
   vindicated. That arch enemy, who had once threatened the throne of the
   Highest, and was waving his triumphant banner over one of the fairest
   provinces of the universal empire created by the eternal Son, was to be
   consigned to chains of everlasting darkness. The eternal Son, who had
   once baffled that enemy in heaven, was to complete his conquest on
   earth. A new, and "strange," and glorious development of infinite love
   was to be displayed. A new, and "strange," and awful demonstration of
   infinite justice was to astound the universe--to be reverberated
   through eternity. The second person of the Trinity, in the fulness of
   time, descended from heaven, and shrouded his divinity in the vestment
   of flesh. It was the descent of a God; and his movements on earth were
   to be the footsteps of a God. His absence from the celestial court was
   not merely that he might pass through the ceremony of incarnation, and
   thence return, untouched by pain, to his native heavens, wearing on his
   triumphant brow the cheap--gained trophies of an enemy subdued and a
   world redeemed. The trophies which he earned on earth were earned by
   the bloody sweat, the viewless, nameless agonies of a suffering, dying
   God. It was not for the purpose of a ceremonious incarnation; it was
   that, with divine throes and spasms unimaginable by men or angels, he
   might save a perishing race, and fix on adamantine foundations the
   everlasting column of infinite justice, that he left vacant--if we may
   so say--for more than thirty years of what we call time, the right-hand
   seat of the celestial throne.

   Thirdly. The prevalent theory imparts a figurative signification, not
   merely to a few inspired passages, but to all that mighty mass of
   scriptural truths which, having for their basis the sufferings of
   Christ, constitute the sinews, and arteries, and very heart of the
   Bible. By figurative signification we mean every departure from the
   literal and obvious import of the words interpreted, by whatever name
   the authors of such departure may choose to characterize it. That the
   vital elements of the Bible consist in the expiatory agonies of the
   incarnate God, no Christian will doubt. It is the merit of those
   sufferings which renders it the book of hope, the star of comfort, the
   rock of confidence. What would have been the Bible without the atoning
   pangs of Christ? It would have been a desert of burning sands, with no
   spot of recreating green, no cooling spring to cheer the mournful
   journey from the cradle to an unquiet grave.

   If the abounding scriptural passages declarative of Christ's sufferings
   are to be received in their literal and obvious import, then the
   conclusion that his divinity participated in his expiatory agonies is
   just as certain as the conclusion that his Godhead became incarnate.
   The great central truth, that the whole Christ of the Bible suffered,
   has received the seal of each august person of the Trinity. The Holy
   Ghost promulged it often in the Old Testament, and unceasingly in the
   New. The blessed Son proclaimed it from the time he began to preach
   glad tidings on earth until his stupendous reappearance at Patmos. The
   infinite Father confirmed it when he summoned his sleeping sword to
   awake and smite his Fellow. This great central truth has passed into
   scriptural demonstration, if the asseverations of the Bible are not to
   be lost in allegory. The Bible and the prevalent theory stand in direct
   collision. To escape the dilemma, then theory invokes its transmuting
   powers. The scriptural truths must be made to evaporate in metaphor, or
   the theory of fifteen centuries cannot be sustained.

   There is nothing on the face of the scriptural passages indicating a
   figurative meaning. Their conversion into figures of speech is not
   required or justified by any other portions of Holy Writ. The subject
   matter of the passages would seem to interdict figurative
   interpretation. The Holy Ghost is recounting the sufferings and death
   of his fellow God. Pathos, when profound, is wont to select, for the
   outpourings of the heart, the plainest and most simple terms to be
   found in speech. "Jesus wept" and "It is finished" are akin in
   expressive brevity and grandeur, to that most concise, yet most sublime
   of sentences, "God said, Let there be light, and there was light."

   Theological science has no authority delegated from above to veil the
   simplicity of scriptural truth beneath drapery woven in the looms of
   earth. On this theme we would, if in our power, give such compass to
   the voice of our feeble remonstrance as to make it heard and felt in
   every school of sacred lore. Even a human record is held sacred. It
   carries on its face incontrovertible verity. It speaks for itself; and
   its responses are unalterable as the imagined decrees of classic fate.
   It cannot be impeached from without. Should the attempt be made, the
   mandatory voice of the law would exclaim, "Travel not out of the
   record." An effort to turn into figures of speech its plain and simple
   language would indicate aberration of intellect. The Bible is a
   heavenly record. It was indited by the third of the Sacred Three, and
   sealed with the blood of the second. Of this Inspired Record, the Holy
   Ghost is the interpreter. God is the expounder of the words of God.

   Theological lore may evolve the latent meaning of Scripture, by
   comparing sacred texts with sacred texts, for that still leaves it to
   God to explain himself. It may borrow elucidations from scriptural
   history, and scriptural geography, for they are constituent, though
   inferior parts of the Sacred Volume. It may treat particular passages
   as figurative, if necessary to preserve the symmetry of Scripture. It
   may, for instance, teach us to believe that the scriptural delineations
   of the corporeal lineaments of the disembodied Deity are figurative,
   because we are elsewhere taught in the Bible that "God is a Spirit."
   But where the scriptural terms themselves indicate no departure from
   directness of meaning, and come not into collision with other parts of
   Holy Writ, academic science has no right to plant in the sacred soil
   metaphors of human growth. A still, small voice ever whispers from
   above, "Travel not out of the record of God." The conversion of plain
   language into figurative language may shake the foundations of our
   faith. It may fearfully "add unto," or "take away from the book" of
   life, which closed with the last chapter of Revelation. The imputation
   of metaphorical signification to the sacred and clear passages
   declarative of Christ's agonies subtracts from the atonement of the
   Bible its suffering God, and sinks the great expiatory sacrifice from
   its scriptural infinitude down to a finite atom.

   The boldest development of reasoning pride is the right which it often
   claims and exercises to construe Scripture by its own microscopic views
   of what is "fitting to God." This dangerous error formed, as we have
   seen, the major proposition of the Athanasian syllogism. Without it,
   the prevalent theory might not have held Christendom in its fetters for
   fifteen successive centuries. Stand forth, reasoning pride, and let us
   commune together You say that it is not "fitting to God" to suffer,
   even from his own free volition and sovereign choice. And what think
   you, then, of the holy incarnation? Declare. Is it "fitting to God,"
   the infinite Spirit, to have "been made flesh, and dwelt among us?" Is
   it "fitting to God," the great God, to have been born in a manger, and
   wrapped in its straw? Is it "fitting to God," the Architect of the
   universe, to have been a laborious journeyman in the workshop of
   Joseph? Is it "fitting to God," accustomed to the ministration of
   angels, to have washed the feet of his betraying and deserting
   disciples? Is it "fitting to God," the object of heaven's hallelujahs,
   to have submitted in meekness to the scoffings, and scourgings, and
   spittings of the blaspheming mob? When you have responded to all these
   interrogatories you may be the better able to appreciate the soundness
   of your favourite dogma, that it is not "fitting to God" to suffer.

   Fourthly. The prevalent theory tends to lower the eye of devotion from
   the Godhead of Christ to his manhood. To worship the created humanity
   of Mary's son alone, would be idolatrous worship. To love the glorified
   man more than the indwelling God, would be impiously loving the
   creature more than the Creator. We should love the whole united being
   of Christ. We should love the finite much; the infinite unspeakably
   more. The instinct of our nature leads us to regard, with peculiar
   favour, him who has bestowed on us signal benefits, especially if the
   tomb has closed over our benefactor. Affection preserves in fond
   remembrance the gift of a departed friend. A grateful country bedews,
   with overflowing tears, the grave of the patriot who has suffered and
   died for its sake. And if we are taught to consider the pathetic story
   of Christ's agonies and death as but the biography of the human son of
   the Virgin, and to regard the indwelling God, through all his
   incarnation, as standing aloof from pains, wrapped in the mantle of
   impassibility, our warm affections may be drawn too much from the
   impassible God, and placed too fondly on the suffering man. In blotting
   out from the scriptural picture the soul-absorbing and soul-expanding
   agonies of the incarnate Deity, and fixing the mental vision on the
   suffering manhood of Christ, the prevalent theory gives the human
   figure too attractive a place on the canvass. It tends to impair the
   spirituality and sublimity of worship, and to sink devotion, as it
   were, from heaven down to earth.

   Fifthly. The prevalent theory unwittingly strengthens the Unitarian
   error. The startling syllogism of Arius stood thus: The divine essence
   is impassible: Christ suffered in both his celestial and human natures;
   therefore, his celestial nature was not divine. Had the Council of Nice
   made but a single thrust at the major proposition of this syllogism,
   the heresy of Arius would scarcely have outlived its author. But,
   unfortunately, the fathers of the Nicene Council assented to its major
   proposition: they conceded the hypothesis of God's impassibility. They
   had then nothing left but to declare against its minor proposition--the
   suffering of Christ in his united natures--a dubious war. Modern
   Unitarianism, except in its very lowest grade, rests on the same
   identical syllogism.

   We regard the Unitarian heresy as the most formidable foe of our holy
   religion. The polar region of wintry Atheism is bound in its own
   eternal frosts. Professed Infidelity can never be perennial where the
   warm pulsations of the human heart are felt. The creative spirit of a
   Hume or a Gibbon may, ever and anon, breathe into it the breath of
   precarious life: but, whenever the strong stimulant of sustaining
   genius is withdrawn, it sinks down, like Thomas Paine, a lifeless,
   offensive, and forgotten corse. But Unitarianism, decked in the
   beautiful habiliments of the social virtues, is a brilliant and
   dangerous meteor. Under its ever-changing phases and varying names it
   has, like a portentous comet, threatened the system of Christian faith
   for more than fifteen centuries.

   The inquirer after truth, while dwelling on the atonement of the
   prevalent theory, finds that the view of its creature sufferings leaves
   an aching void in his heart. This unsatisfied vacuity ever invites the
   intrusion of seductive, and often fatal errors. If Christendom would
   extirpate the Unitarian heresy, let a concentrated blow be aimed at the
   major proposition of its upholding syllogism. Wrest from it its
   earth-woven mantle of the divine impassibility. Strip it of its armour
   of proof. That Christ suffered in his united natures is a position
   deeply bedded in the everlasting truth of Sacred Writ. The hypothesis
   of God's impassibility has no foundation in his Holy Word. Divine
   impassibility is the chief corner-stone of the Unitarian faith. Remove
   that corner-stone, and the whole structure will totter to its
   foundation.

CHAPTER XXII.

   Early History of Truth that Divinity of Christ Participated in
   Suffering--Early History of Prevalent Theory--Its Inconsistencies--Has
   Theology for Closet and Theology for Sanctuary --Its Hymns and Prayers
   and Sermons--Effects upon Devotion from unmasked and universal
   Development of Theory

   THE soul-elevating truth that the divinity of Christ participated in
   his expiatory agonies, was not a stranger in the early Christian
   Church. Athanasius himself, in his appended argument, treated and
   anathematized it as an article of pre-existent faith. This doctrine of
   our holy religion, always at variance with the Arian heresy, had now to
   oppose the more formidable hostility of him who was generally esteemed
   the lawgiver of primeval orthodoxy. It had, moreover, to encounter the
   errors of its professed friends, not less dangerous than the opposition
   of its open assailants. Long before the birth of Athanasius, and as
   early as the second and third centuries, a sect had appeared and
   reappeared, called Patripassians, who affirmed that the only person of
   the Godhead was the infinite Father, and that he became the incarnate
   sufferer. About the time of Athanasius' death, Apollonaris, bishop of
   Laodicea, while holding to the true faith that the divinity of our Lord
   participated in his vicarious pains, infused into it the dangerous
   heresy that Christ had no human soul. With errors like these did the
   subtleties of the primitive ages involve the simple truth, that both
   the mediatorial natures shared in the atoning sufferings.

   Thus opposed by Arian heretics, hunted down by those who claimed a
   patent for exclusive orthodoxy, bewildered in the intermingled errors
   of its own friends, this truth of our holy religion had another trial
   to encounter. The terrible arm of civil authority was uplifted. In the
   year 388, the emperor Theodosius, moved, no doubt, by the followers of
   Athanasius, passed an edict, excluding from the right to dwell in
   cities, from the franchise of having bishops or other spiritual
   fathers, from the sacred privilege of worshipping in the temples of the
   living God, all who dared to refuse their allegiance to the dominant
   creed. A military force was organized to carry the edict into effect,
   and death followed in its train. It is said that the Inquisition, with
   its dungeons and torturing wheel, owed its birth to this epoch.*

   *Rees' Cyclopædia, Article, Apollinarians. Ibid. Article, Theodosius I.

   About the middle of the fifth century, Eutyches became the founder of
   another compound of truth and falsity. He held that the second person
   of the Trinity united to the body that was prepared for him, but one
   spiritual nature. As the new faith sought virtually to abstract from
   Christ his human soul, it must of course have imputed sufferings to his
   divinity. One class of the Eutychians, called Theopascites, maintained
   that the Father and the Holy Ghost, as well as the blessed Son,
   suffered in the passion of Jesus Christ. The followers of Eutyches were
   ultimately consolidated under the name of Monophosites, the heresy of
   the one nature imparting to them their distinctive appellation. Against
   the Eutychians of every shade were fulminated, from the west, the
   thunders of the Vatican, and, from the east, the edicts of imperial
   despotism, announcing degradation and exile as the penalties of their
   faith.

   That the simple doctrine of divine participation in the expiatory
   sufferings, thus confounded by its heretical, friends, and hunted by
   its spiritual and temporal enemies "as a partridge in the mountains,"
   should for ages, have been obliged to seek refuge with the monks of
   Scythia, and in the sequestered regions of Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia,
   Egypt, Nubia and Abyssinia, tinctured with copious infusions of
   bewildering error, ought not to excite our special wonder. To restore
   to its proper place in Christian theology this great scriptural truth,
   stripped of the extraneous heresies in which its early adherents
   unfortunately involved it, is the humble aim of our imperfect essay.

   From the first establishment of the prevalent theory in the fourth
   century, its adherents have found great difficulty in selecting terms
   to express its meaning, without coming too palpably into collision with
   the language of Scripture, or with the deep and strong current of
   popular devotion. This difficulty, seated in the very core of the
   theory, was smothered for several successive generations; but finally
   displayed itself, in a fearful explosion, early in the sixth century.
   In the year 519, the pressing inquiry, threatening the vitality of the
   theory, was widely and vehemently announced: "Whether it could be said,
   with propriety, that one of the Trinity suffered on the cross."*

   *Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, (by Maclaine,) vol. 2. pp. 131, 132.

   This trying inquiry was referred to the Roman pontiff for his solemn
   adjudication. Hormisdas, an adherent of the prevalent theory, then
   filled the papal throne. Had he thought as we think, an affirmative
   response would have been unhesitatingly rendered. But he did not
   believe as we believe. He had received and held "strong as proofs of
   Holy Writ," the hypothesis of Athanasius that God is impassible. That
   hypothesis compelled him to respond in the negative. For how would his
   conscience have permitted a pontifical decree, that "it could be said
   with propriety that one of the Trinity suffered on the cross," when he
   believed in his heart that from everlasting to everlasting each of the
   Sacred Three is wrapped in impassability, as with a garment? That one
   of the Trinity could not in fact have suffered on the cross, if
   suffering is diametrically opposed to the fundamental and changeless
   laws of his being, is a self-evident truism. And to have said that one
   of the Trinity suffered on the cross against what was deemed the
   eternal truth of his own holy nature, must have seemed to the Roman
   pontiff a libel upon the awful attributes of the Godhead.

   The negative response of the papal oracle filled Christendom with
   consternation. It had lifted the veil from the prevalent theory,
   leaving it exposed in all its unscriptural lineaments. It had revealed
   to the Christian world the appalling truth that the dogma of Athanasius
   substituted, for the sufferings of the Creator, the sufferings of the
   creature. Dissatisfaction was first heard in ominous whispers. Soon it
   burst forth in a thunder peal of remonstrance, commencing in the wilds
   of Scythia, and rolling onward, and gathering strength as it rolled
   towards the throne of the spiritual Caesar. The friends of the
   Prevalent theory were deeply and justly alarmed. It could be saved only
   by severing what has been deemed the else continuous chain of
   pontifical infallibility.

   Hormisdas then slept with his fathers; John II. reigned in his stead.
   Another appeal was made to the incumbent of St. Peter's chair. The new
   pontiff paused. He saw full before him the recorded decree, not yet
   twenty years old, of his ghostly predecessor. Papal consistency loudly
   demanded his forbearance. The acclamations of the Christian world urged
   him forward. From its death struggle, the prevalent theory, dear to him
   as life, stretched forth its supplicating hand for aid. He reversed the
   decree of Hormisdas; he proclaimed to succeeding generations that "it
   could be said with propriety that one of the Trinity suffered on the
   cross." Utterly disbelieving the fact, he nevertheless decreed that it
   could with propriety be affirmed. He cast over the theory, the kind
   veil which his predecessor had rent.*

   * Rees' Cyclopædia, Article, John II. Pope of Rome.

   Had there been no discrepancy between the decrees of the successors of
   St. Peter--had the decree of John confirmed that of Hormisdas--the
   prevalent theory would probably have perished in the second century of
   its existence. The mind of the millions, then thoroughly aroused, would
   scarcely have brooked, and sustained, and sent it down to posterity,
   the unmasked dogma that the second of the Holy Trinity suffered for the
   redemption of the world only in metaphor. Without the restitution of
   its wordy covering, the theory must have sunk beneath the conscious and
   frowning eye of the Christian mass. Justinian, the reigning emperor of
   the East--the architect of the immortal civil code--the patron of
   sacred as well as juridical lore--would not leave the great truth,
   involved in the question upon which the two fathers of western
   Christendom had disagreed, to rest on the unstable basis of clashing
   papal bulls. In the year 553, he invoked at Constantinople a council of
   the universal church, styled in ecclesiastical history, the fifth
   general council. That high tribunal confirmed the second pontifical
   decree. That "it could be said with propriety that one of the Trinity
   suffered on the cross," was now finally established as a fundamental
   article of theology by the united authorities of the Christian world.
   Thus, if speech intends what its words fairly import, the vital truth
   seemed to be fixed on a changeless rock, that

   Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, (by Maclaine) vol. 2. p. 130

   divine as well as human suffering was incurred for the salvation of the
   redeemed. But, alas! speech does not always mean what its words
   seemingly import.

   In the composition of the fifth general council was mingled a
   controling infusion of the prevalent theory. Their decretal language
   had an occult meaning, radically different from its ostensible import.
   It ostensibly imported that one of the Trinity actually suffered for
   the remission of mortal sins. The council declared that it was proper
   to say he had suffered. And how could an affirmation be proper, unless
   it was true, especially when applied to the Majesty of heaven? To say
   untruth of man is always reprehensible; to say untruth of the living
   God can be saved from the charge of impiety only by innocency of
   intention. The declaration that "it could be said with propriety that
   one of the Trinity suffered on the cross," was equivalent to declaring
   that he had actually suffered. And yet the master spirits of the sixth
   century believed no such thing. The hypothesis of divine impassibility
   had wound itself around their souls perhaps more closely than the
   Bible. The words of their lips and the thoughts of their hearts were
   diametrically opposed. What caused this mysterious discrepancy?
   Stratagem in war is justified by the perhaps too flexible policy of
   profane history. We would not impute to the polemic champions of the
   Justinian age the admission of like stratagem into ecclesiastical
   conflict. And yet the unwelcome question will spontaneously arise, why
   else did they send their ghostly bark along the flood of time with
   false colors floating at her mast?

   The position established by the fifth general council yet holds its
   place in academic theology, unmoved by the lapse of ages. The decree of
   the sixth century has never been reversed; reformations have not
   reformed it. Still the time-worn proposition, that it can "be said with
   propriety that one of the Trinity suffered on the cross," has its
   meaning official, and its meaning confidential. To the general mind it
   shadows forth the sublime conception that the second of the Sacred
   Three, made incarnate, actually endured redeeming pangs for our
   salvation; to the initiated it imports only that he suffered by
   construction in the sufferings of the associated man. We would not cast
   censure upon our learned, pious, and venerated opponents; they have but
   yielded honest allegiance to that theory which came down to them as a
   consecrated relic of the olden time, scarcely second to the Bible in
   its dominant authority. Of that theory, discrepancy between its
   thoughts and words was an original, inherent, and vital element;
   without which it would not have ruled for fifteen centuries.

   The proposition affirmed by the second papal decree and the fifth
   general council is a striking sample of the bewildering language of the
   prevalent faith in all the generations of its existence. The learned
   well understand its occult meaning; but the millions are little
   conscious how it empties the atonement of that which constitutes it the
   glory of the universe. Go, simple hearted reader, to the sanctuary
   where the triune Jehovah is recognized and worshipped. What is it that
   swells heavenward the seraphic notes of its sublime psalmody? What is
   it that bends the knee of the heart in its pathetic prayers? What is it
   that imparts to the teachings of its heaven-ordained pulpit their power
   over the soul? It is the conscious presence of a Suffering, dying,
   risen God. Follow to his closet the sacred teacher, and how would your
   heart sink within you if, finding him a disciple of the prevalent
   theory, he should lift the veil from his ancient idol, and invoke its
   denunciation of your Sabbath day dream as an heretic delusion!

   The prevalent theory has not been wont to devotions in the sanctuary
   its occult meaning. We do not affirm that it is never announced there.
   Yet we believe that its open developments in the temples of Jehovah are

   "Like angels' visits, few and far between."

   But while the exclusive humanity of the redeeming pains is seldom
   promulged in Christian worship, the house of God, in spite of the
   prevalent theory, is ever vocal with the spirit-stirring thoughts of a
   suffering Deity. We appeal to the psalmody of Christendom. From the
   sacred melodies of its principal churches, we have selected copious,
   extracts, which will speak from our appendix to the head and the
   heart.* If these copious extracts have truth in their composition, they
   must needs expose the fallacy of the prevalent theory. They portray the
   sufferings of the dying, risen God in terms more glowing than any our
   imagination could command. The extracts are too copious for insertion
   in the body of our work. We implore the candid searcher after truth not
   to allow them to escape his attention because we have been obliged to
   locate them in the appendix.

   * See Appendix, No. 3. p. 358.

   The appended extracts are, indeed, poetic effusions; but they are
   effusions deliberately incorporated into the devotions of the
   sanctuary, and read and sung for successive generations in the temples
   of the true God. We would not chill the heart of poesy; it is the

   "Gilded halo hovering round"

   the sad realities of mortality. We know, we feel, that the poetic muse
   is never so lost in inspiration, as when her pen is dipped in

   "Siloa's brook that flow'd

   Fast by the oracle of God."

   But sacred poesy must not--dare not--transplant into consecrated soil,
   flowers gathered in fairy land. Her hymns of praise breathed forth in
   God's house, must be truthful as the sister chaunts of the upper
   sanctuary. The terrestrial dwelling place of Him in whose sight "the
   heavens are not clean" may not admit falsity, open or disguised, in
   prose or in song, within its hallowed walls. What would be said of
   psalmody, read and sung in the sanctuaries of our holy religion for
   years and for centuries, which should ascribe lack of power to the
   All-powerful, or lack of wisdom to the All-wise; which should, deny
   prescience to Him who "inhabiteth eternity," or impute untruth to the
   God of truth? And yet if the Bible has, indeed, taught that the Deity
   is, by the laws of his own blessed being, necessarily impassible--that
   he could not suffer without ceasing to be God--the ascription of
   suffering to him in his own holy temple, either in prose or in rhyme,
   by those who believe and affirm his impassibility, would seem no less
   impious than derogating from his infinite power, or wisdom, or
   knowledge, or verity.

   Some author says, that, if he had control of the ballads of a nations
   he would not care who controlled its laws. Psalms and hymns are the
   ballads of our religion. Over the general mind they exercise a
   dominion, perhaps wider and more absolute than the formal teachings of
   the pulpit. They accompany devotion to its home; they live in its
   memory; they are chaunted at its domestic altar; they hover around its
   pillow; they are graven, as it were, "upon the palms of its hands."
   Error is nowhere more dangerous than when insinuated into the harmonies
   of the church. Sacred verse has no poetic license to misrepresent the
   attributes of the Deity, and call such misrepresentation a figure of
   speech! If it be indeed a revealed truth that God can no more suffer
   than he can sin, Christian psalmody, with the belief of that truth
   resting on its soul, had better have hung its harp forever "upon the
   willows" than wilfully to have predicated suffering of the eternally
   IMPASSIBLE!

   The royal David was a poet. Israel's king was the prince of sacred
   song; unequalled and unapproached, save by other heaven-taught bards,
   in simplicity, in pathos, in glowing imagery, in awful sublimity, in
   that dissecting power over the human heart, which lays open its
   spiritual anatomy to its very core. Falsity found no place in the
   minstrelsy of Jesse's son. Clothed in the richest drapery of Oriental
   metaphor, his soaring thoughts are nevertheless true as the verity of
   heaven. Christian psalmody, in its multifarious ascriptions of
   suffering to Him, believed to be impassible from the fixed elements of
   his holy being, can, if such ascriptions are untrue, find no precedent
   or extenuation in the truth-breathing rhapsodies of David's sacred
   harp.

   We believe that the melodies of Christendom, ascribing suffering to
   Christ's divine nature, were prompted, or at least approved, by the
   Spirit of Truth, who "helpeth our infirmities" and "maketh intercession
   for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."--Romans, 8. 26. The
   Captain of our salvation himself declared, "Where two or three are
   gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of
   them."--Matthew, 18. 20. The great Head of the Church, then, presides
   over his own sanctuaries. He has listened to every sincere anthem of
   thanksgiving and adoration that has ascended since his own ascension,
   and, as it rose toward heaven, has breathed upon it his most precious
   benediction. The psalmody of Christendom he would not have permitted,
   for fifteen centuries, to run astray on the sacred theme of his own
   expiatory sufferings. Asia, and Africa, and Europe, and America, and
   the Isles of the Seas, would not have been allowed, for successive
   generations, to defame the attributes of his Godhead, in their songs of
   praise, within his own holy temples, and in his own immediate presence.
   The melodies of the general church, read and sung for ages, and
   pervading all its denominations, are the irrepressible outpourings of
   pious feeling; they are the comments of unschooled devotion upon the
   plain language of Holy Writ, sanctioned, as we believe, by the
   presiding Lord of Christian assemblies. The godly heart is often a
   better scriptural commentator than the learned head.

   If we pass from the poetry of the sanctuary to its prose, we shall find
   its pulpit teachings often as unequivocal as its melodies. The
   occupants of the sacred desk, even of the prevalent faith, are
   frequently borne along by their own glowing and irrepressible
   convictions far beyond the thraldom of their earth-formed theory. The
   great Hooker exclaimed from the depths of his pious soul,

   "We care for no knowledge in the world but this,

   that man hath sinned, and God hath suffered."

   And yet the great Hooker bowed to the sceptre of the dominant theory!
   The profound Barrow, when he poured forth the following tribute to
   truth, must have felt falling from around him the shackles which he had
   thought himself born to wear. He says:

   "That the immortal God should die, that the Most High should be debased
   to so low a condition, as it cannot be heard without wonder, so it
   could not be undertaken without huge reason, nor accomplished without
   mighty effect."

   The learned Witherspoon, emancipated from theory for a moment by his
   uplifting devotion, with his suffering God full before him, could not
   choose but exclaim:

   "It was no less a person than the eternal and only-begotten Son of God,
   who was before all worlds, the brightness of his Father's glory, and
   the express image of his person, who suffered in our stead."

   The eloquent Robert Hall, oblivious for the time to all terrestrial
   dogmas, burst forth into the following truthful rhapsody:

   "He who upholdeth all things sinking under a weight of suffering--the
   Lord of life, the Lord of glory, expiring on a cross the Light of the
   world sustaining an awful eclipse--the Sun of righteousness immerged in
   the shadow of death."

   And yet the eloquent Hall yielded fealty to the dominant theory!

   We have copiously selected and inserted in our appendix similar
   extracts from the discourses of many other pulpit teachers, belonging
   to the prevalent faith, and justly claiming brotherhood in profoundness
   of intellect, extent of erudition, and depth of piety, with Hooker and
   Barrow and Witherspoon and Hall. Thus we array against the theory, the
   authority of those very names, to which it clings for its solo support.
   In perusing the appended extracts, too copious for insertion in the
   body of our volume, the intelligent reader cannot but wonder at the
   inherent and self-destroying inconsistencies of error, however
   vigilantly guarded by talent and learning.*

   *See Appendix, No. 4. p. 368.

   The more formal and published prayers of the sanctuary, so far as they
   have reached our knowledge, afford no aid to the prevalent theory. The
   unwritten prayers of dissenting Christendom have left no record behind
   them, save on the pious hearts of their hearers. To that living record
   we appeal. How often in those oral supplications, has devotion been
   melted to its deepest pathos, or lifted to its sublimest rhapsody, by
   the immediate vision of its own suffering, dying, risen God! In such a
   place, at such a time, when the curtain between our world and heaven
   seems withdrawn for the moment, how unsatisfactory and chilling appears
   that terrestrial theory, which recognizes as the only vicarious
   sufferer, the human son of the Virgin!

   What would be the fate of general devotion should the prevalent theory
   habitually develope its occult meaning in its sanctuaries, as plainly
   as it now does in its closets? Let not its clerical adherents respond
   from the mere inspection of their own devout hearts. They may find
   there a vigorous piety, capable of overcoming the poison of an
   insulated error. But not every descendant of Jacob could, like Sampson,
   have broken the seven green withs of the Philistines, "as a thread of
   tow is broken when it toucheth the fire." Our inquiry seeks the bearing
   of the unmasked theory upon the promiscuous throng of gospel hearers;
   some "babes in Christ;" some "filled with unbelief and sin;" some going
   to the sanctuary "to spy out" "the nakedness of the land." Nor must the
   response to our inquiry be influenced by the assumption that the
   channel of devotion has widened and deepened since the days of
   Athanasius. Adopting the assumption as a glorious truth, it follows not
   that the increase of piety has been caused by the prevalent theory.
   From its cradle, the theory has generally reposed, as a sort of
   hieroglyphic in the archives of the learned. It has seldom made its
   public exhibition; its occult characters have not often been
   deciphered.

   Our own response to the inquiry we render with diffidence and humility.
   And yet is the conviction deeply engraved on our soul, that the
   unmasked development of the prevalent theory, from sabbath to sabbath,
   from sanctuary to sanctuary, from continent to continent, until it
   should become as familiar to universal Christendom as the Prayer of
   prayers taught by our Lord, would, in its bearings on the general mass,
   exercise a deleterious influence over that blessed cause which cost the
   dying agonies of the Son of God. It would tend to infuse the chill of
   winter into the soul of piety.

   In view of such unmasked development, how would Unitarian scoffers
   reiterate, and give to the four winds, the taunt once uttered by one of
   their ablest and most eloquent, "Thus the vaunted system goes out--in
   words. The Infinite victim proves to be a frail man; and God's share in
   the sacrifice is a mere fiction!"* Under such a development, how would
   devotion, simple-hearted and unschooled, mourn and wail at the
   abstraction of her suffering, dying, risen God; saying, as the weeping
   Mary said at the sepulchre, "They have taken away my Lord, and I know
   not where they have laid him!" Should such a catastrophe occur, we
   could but submit the ark of our salvation to the guidance of Him, who
   "hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm."

CHAPTER XXIII.

   Practical Effects of Doctrine of Divinity of Christ's
   Sufferings--Deepens Views of Sin--Exalts Justice of God--His
   Love--Magnifies Value of Soul--Affords sure Foundation of Christian
   Confidence--Elevates Views of Atonement.

   WE shall doubtless be accused of attempting to disturb one of the
   ancient landmarks of Christian faith. That this attempt is not a wanton
   innovation, may have appeared from the preceding pages. Yet farther to
   vindicate and illustrate our discussion, it will be useful, at the
   hazard of some seeming, though not real repetition, to state succinctly
   the respective and opposing bearings of the prevalent theory, and of
   that which we advocate, upon some of the cardinal points of our, holy
   religion. It will thence become manifest that our views are as salutary
   in practice as they are well founded in scriptural authority.

   First. The development of the stupendous truth that the eternal Son,
   "manifest in the flesh," suffered and died in his own ethereal essence,
   for the redemption of the world, unfolds to our apprehension new and
   more appalling exhibitions of the potency and turpitude of sin than are
   presented by the prevalent theory. If we have confidence in the wisdom
   of an earthly physician, we are best taught the extremity of a physical
   malady by learning the extremity of the means to which he is driven for
   its cure. Should he find himself obliged, by efforts beyond mortal
   endurance, to sacrifice his own life for the life of his patient, it
   would be an affecting demonstration, not only of his matchless
   compassion, but also of the inveterate malignancy of the disease, which
   he could not otherwise assuage.

   There is a principle of evil in the universe second only to Omnipotence
   in its fearful power. It once, with exulting hopes of success, unfurled
   its standard of rebellion in the very capitol of the empire of Jehovah,
   within the sound of the thunders of his almighty throne, drawing after
   it one third part of the bright intelligences of heaven. To check this
   principle of evil, and confine it within secure limits, without
   infringing the freedom of creature volition and action, requires from
   infinite wisdom, perhaps its highest development. This evil principle
   is not less blighting than it is potent. It has converted our
   terrestrial Eden into a howling wilderness. It is the creator and
   eternal preserver of its own indwelling hell. Sin's own unchanging
   laws, engraven on tablets which time cannot moulder, have immutably
   ordained that every creature of this or any other world, who
   transgresses, must bid adieu to bliss, unless there be a renovation of
   his moral nature. He will forever carry within him the undying worm.
   His own breast must be the everlasting receptacle and feeder of the
   quenchless, yet unconsuming fire. He cannot escape it by flight:

   "For within him hell

   He brings, and round about him, nor from hell

   One step, no more than from himself, can fly

   By change of place."

   These awful yet salutary truths are best brought home to the soul by a
   close meditation, not only on the visible death of expiation at
   Calvary, but also, and beyond measure more especially, on the spiritual
   crucifixion of the only-begotten, the eternal Son of the Highest. How
   fearfully deleterious must be that wide-spread principle of evil, the
   mere local development of which required, as a preliminary to its
   pardon, such an atoning sacrifice! How frightful must have been the
   virulence of that moral malady, which could only be cured by the blood
   of God!

   Secondly. We would not, by limiting the expiatory sufferings to the
   manhood of Christ, detract, as the prevalent theory unspeakably
   detracts, from the sublime exhibition of the justice of the God,
   manifested in the great work of redemption, and portrayed with such
   ineffable simplicity, pathos, and power in the Sacred Oracles. The
   execution of the scriptural scheme of the atonement, whose vicarious
   victim was the Architect of the worlds, elicited a development of the
   inflexible justice of the Godhead, new and "strange" in the annals of
   eternity. Compared with it, the expulsion of the third part of heaven
   from their blessed abodes; compared with it, the impassable ramparts of
   hell, and its adamantine vaults, and quenchless fires, and ceaseless
   wailings, might pass without special wonder, we would almost say, as
   pertaining to the ordinary administration of the system of penal
   jurisprudence, ordained by a wise and righteous God for the government
   of his boundless empire.

   But if permitted to behold a scene, perhaps too sacred for creature
   vision, how must the hierarchies of heaven have stood aghast, as the
   Ancient of Days, arrayed in the most awful habiliments of avenging
   Omnipotence, drew forth from its long repose his own almighty
   sword--the sharpest weapon in the armory of the Godhead--to smite--as a
   God alone could smite, and with an effect which a God alone could
   endure--the beloved and unresisting fellow of his everlasting reign!
   Let not the dwellers upon the earth be taught to regard this sublimest
   of scriptural delineations as magnificent imagery alone, fitly evolved
   by Oriental metaphor. To suppose that the Lord of Hosts awakened his
   slumbering sword--slumbering, perhaps, from the earliest eternity--to
   smite the mere frail humanity of him who was cradled in the manger,
   would be to sink, in mortal estimation, this stupendous scene in the
   annals of the Godhead from the infinite down to the finite.

   That demonstration of infinite justice which forms the prominent and
   august feature of the atonement consists in the awful truth that God
   the Father "spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all."
   And ever mark the mighty terms "his own Son!" The theory of earth,
   which virtually holds that the eternal Son was spared; that the
   unspared one of the Father was but the human son of Mary; that the
   eternal Son suffered no more to redeem our fallen race than he did in
   their creation, robs the atonement of all its magnificence. Let it not
   be alleged that God the Father "spared not his own Son, but delivered
   him up for us all," and thus satisfied the plenitude of the declaration
   of the Holy Ghost, when, for a space brief compared with eternity, he
   allowed him to depart from the celestial courts, and to dwell on earth
   in a tabernacle of clay, carrying, however, with him the undiminished
   beatitude of the Godhead, in the same way as an earthly father may be
   said to spare not his own son, but to deliver him up, when he sends him
   from the domestic hearth, to sojourn for a season in foreign climes! We
   would not willingly impute to the prevalent theory so irreverent a
   prostration of the majesty of the atonement.

   Thirdly. Nor would we derogate, as the prevalent theory immeasurably
   derogates, from the infinite love displayed by the triune God in the
   redemption of the world. Let it never be forgotten that the sending of
   his well-beloved Son by the infinite Father to be the ransom of our
   fallen race, and the voluntary acceptance of that terrible mission by
   the infinite Son, and the contributory agency of the Holy Ghost to
   render the mission efficacious, are everywhere represented in Scripture
   as the concentration and sublimation of the ineffable love of the
   united Godhead; compared with which the displays of divine goodness, in
   the variegated works of creation, sink, as it were, into comparative
   unimportance. It was a distant and twilight glimpse of this sublime
   development of infinite love that awakened to such unearthly harmony
   the consecrated harps of the prophets and inspired patriarchs of old.
   It was a clearer view of this stupendous miracle of grace, unmatched
   even by the Godhead, that ever and anon roused the profoundly
   argumentative Paul to such bursts of holy rhapsody. It was this view,
   melting the heart of the beloved disciple, which prompted that
   simplest, that most touching, that most comprehensive and expressive of
   scriptural sentences, "God is love."

   And do all these sublime indications of Scripture point, indeed, to
   nothing but the simple fact that the second person of the Trinity, by
   the mandate of the Father and his own volition, condescendingly and
   graciously came into the world, to occupy for a time, in all the
   perfection of infinite beatitude, the "body" that was prepared for him,
   and then to return, untouched by suffering, to his celestial home, and
   there receive the rapturous and cheap-earned gratulations of heaven on
   his having just created, from a moral chaos, a new spiritual world,
   more glorious than any of those which, at the beginning of time, had
   roused the swelling anthem of the "morning stars?" Such is not the
   scriptural picture of the love of the Godhead displayed in the
   redemption of the world.

   Fourthly. If we may justly conclude that the second person of the
   Trinity, clothed in flesh, suffered and died for the redemption of the
   human soul, not in his manhood alone, but also in his divinity, the
   conclusion will impart new and ineffable value to the immaterial,
   breathing, living, immortal principle within us. Seneca, the heathen
   philosopher, termed the soul a "little god cased in flesh." The Bible
   imparts to it a rank higher than was ever imagined in the dreams of
   pagan mythology. God formed material man "of the dust of the ground;"
   but he "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a
   living soul." The soul of man, then, is an emanation of the Deity. It
   is a spirit kindred to the ethereal essence of its almighty Creator.
   Christ, while on earth, interrogatively declared that it would be a
   losing contract for a man to barter, for the whole world, his own soul.
   This theoretic proposition, like other abstract truths, even of the
   Bible, is best brought home to the heart by practical elucidation. If
   we would see it thus illustrated by its divine Author, let us stand
   beside his viewless cross, and, in contemplating his unseen spiritual
   and divine sufferings for its ransom, learn at what price the soul was
   rated in the celestial exchequer.

   Would man become familiar with the distant bodies of the material
   heavens, he should borrow of science its glorious instrument of
   discovery, which will enable him to walk

   "Abroad through nature, to the range

   Of planets, suns, and adamantine spheres,

   Wheeling unshaken through the void immense"

   The science of sacred truth, too, has its telescope; and if we would
   gain still clearer views of the value of the breathing immortality
   within us, let us, through that consecrated medium of vision, fix our
   steadfast and wondering gaze on the onward flight of a single soul
   through the ages of its eternity. It must sink "a goblin damned," or
   rise a spirit of bliss. In the rank soil of the world of blasphemy, it
   will, in successive ages, swell to a mammoth of guilt; or, in the pure
   atmosphere of heaven, it will, in its upward progress, brighten into an
   archangel, ministering before the throne of God. The prospective
   omniscience of the infinite Son, standing by the grave of a world "dead
   in trespasses and sins" beheld its countless perishing souls, of value
   too precious to be ascertained, save by the arithmetic of heaven. He
   pitied--he redeemed; he redeemed by the immolation of himself. Great
   was the price; greater, in the estimate of infinite love, was the
   redemption purchased.

   Beautiful and glorious is the material universe. Beautiful is our own
   queen of night; glorious our own king of day. Brilliant are yonder
   stars that spangle the firmament; surpassingly majestic when we regard
   them as centres of their own expanding systems, attracting and ruling
   their own wheeling orbs. But to save all these, the Son of God would
   not have died; to redeem them all from one vast consuming
   conflagration, be would not have laid down his most precious life. He
   could have spoken new suns and systems into being. To impart moral life
   to a single soul dead in iniquity, he was obliged to die himself. When
   seen in the scriptural mirror, why will not man learn to appreciate
   that deathless soul, whose matchless value is so well known in heaven?
   Why will man, reckless man, madly throw away that inestimable gem,
   whose ransom cost the death of a God? How could centuries have
   cherished a theory which, by sinking, without scriptural authority, the
   redeeming price, would lower, in the estimation of the dwellers upon
   the earth, the value of their immortal souls?

   Fifthly. The sufferings of Christ, in his divinity, afford a foundation
   for Christian confidence unknown to the prevalent theory. The anxious
   inquirer after religious truth, from whose eyes the scales have begun
   to fall, gazes, now at the frightful turpitude of sin, now at the
   "consuming fire" of Jehovah's wrath. He hears, close behind him, the
   cry of the avenger of blood. He must reach a city of refuge, or
   miserably perish. The prevalent theory points him to one. He finds it
   built of creature sufferings. In vain, at least for the time, is urged
   the dignity and atoning value imparted to the sufferings by the
   juxtaposition of indwelling divinity. He searches, without success, for
   any traces of the theory in Holy Writ. Metaphysical speculation soothes
   not his sin-tossed spirit. It is an icicle to his soul. He must become
   an adept in the prevalent theory before he can cast himself, for
   eternity, on vicarious sufferings less than divine.

   Perhaps, gentle reader, you may yourself be an anxious, and, as yet,
   unbiassed inquirer after religious truth. You may be seeking as for
   hidden treasure, a sure foundation for the sinner's hope. Turn, then,
   to the Book of books. Read the concurrent testimony of the blessed
   Trinity, that its glorious second person, clothed in flesh, endured the
   infinite burden of the vicarious sufferings to save our perishing
   world; to save even you, if you will but accept his "great salvation."
   Deign to believe the declarations of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
   Ghost, in all their stupendous magnitude. Accept as true, and sincere,
   and ingenuous, the assurances of the Sacred Three, though pertaining to
   things incomprehensible to your microscopic vision. Degrade not the
   atonement of the Godhead, by imagining that its second person suffered
   by profession and in name only. Change not into figures of speech the
   plain and simple proclamations which came down from above.

   The anxious, fearing, trembling inquirer after gospel truth, bewildered
   on a sea of doubt and darkness, without a compass or a star, may find,
   in the sufferings of the divinity of Christ, "an anchor of the soul,
   both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;"
   "an anchor" formed in the conclave of the holy Trinity; "sure" as its
   eternal decrees; "steadfast" as the pillars of its everlasting throne.
   Christian confidence, founded on the expiatory agonies of the Creator
   of the worlds, may look down, as from the heaven of heavens on all that
   this poor earth miscalls "sure and steadfast." He who has the witness
   within himself that he is to be partaker in the salvation wrought by
   the divine sufferings of the dying God, may, from the depths of his
   grateful, weeping, joyous heart, triumphantly exclaim with the exulting
   apostle to the Gentiles, "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded
   that He is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that
   day."

   Sixthly. We delight to dwell on the atonement, built of the sufferings
   and cemented by the blood of God, in all its scriptural magnificence.
   It is, beyond peradventure, the mightiest effort of almighty power. God
   spake, and chaos became a universe of moving worlds. He could not speak
   into being the structure of salvation. Its formation cost him his
   incarnation, his sufferings, his death. It is the rainbow glory of
   heaven, concentrating in mild, yet bright effulgence, the mingling and
   harmonious rays of infinite justice, infinite wisdom, and infinite
   love. Upon the just proportions, the beautiful simplicity, the
   exquisite symmetry, the lofty grandeur of this choicest pavilion of the
   Godhead, the holy curiosity of cherubim and seraphim will be riveted
   for countless ages after time shall be no more. It will be remembered
   in hell. Devils will gnash their teeth; but "devils damned" dare not,
   cannot scoff. Forever must they gaze on this wonder of wonders, this
   everlasting monument of their Conqueror's triumph, in silent, in
   speechless despair.

   What gives to this structure its transcendent majesty is the divinity
   of the sufferings of which it was composed. Had not the throes and
   blood of its suffering, dying, risen God pervaded and formed its
   constituent elements, it would have been a splendid pageant that might
   dazzle, but could not satisfy created intelligences. Let not the
   children of men seek to mar its beauty or dim its glory. It was on
   earth that its foundations were laid. It is earth that it has redeemed.
   Let not earth alone, of all the provinces of the universal empire, seek
   to pluck from this temple of salvation its everlasting cornerstone.

   APPENDIX No. 1.

   ARGUMENT OF ATHANASIUS,

   REFERRED TO AT PAGE 41.

   AGAINST THOSE WHO ASSERT THAT, BECAUSE GOD SO WILLED,

   HE SUFFERED.

   As the traveller avoids every wandering from his road, and would suffer
   any inconvenience sooner than leave the highway, thus the pilgrims in
   the path of sound doctrine follow the footprints of those who never
   leave the way, and when they have learned the landmarks of their
   journey, they guard against any departure therefrom, and so are always
   guided in the truth. But some disregard this aim and please themselves
   in unbelief, and abandon the footsteps of the orthodox fathers, and the
   landmarks that the divine instructors have set up, and follow by-paths,
   some discovered by heretics of old, some, at the present time, by
   themselves. Thus they assert this unreasonable dogma; God suffered
   because he so willed. Being unable to demonstrate the paossibility of
   Go " d's"s nature, they do not hesitate to utter untruths concerning
   his will; and if questioned concerning the Divine nature, their answer
   relates to his will. If God's"s nature were ca. pable of suffering,
   then it might be permitted to consider his will; but though, for the
   sake of argument, such a volition were conceded many times, yet could
   that concession not shake the immoveable laws of Nature., What madness,
   then, to assert, that he suffered because he so willeubd! What rational
   man -is unaware that will and nature must harmonize? That the ends of
   nature and the ends of volition must unite, is a truth self-evident;
   and equally so that their limits are fixed, and their aims regulated by
   nature and intelligence. He that would assert the contrary would put
   nature and the will in hostile array, the latter longing for that which
   is impossible, or the former admitting conditions elementally
   destructive to itself. That essenceo that, by its constitution, setting
   will aside, may admit suffering is passible; but that essence, which in
   its nature and being is inconsistent with suffering, may not assume the
   condition of paossibility, though its will may strongly thereto
   consent. Each class of animated beings retains the law and form of its
   first creation, and maintains it irreversibly. Should man ofttimes and
   earnestly desire to be a bird, yet would nature as often overcome that
   will; should he long for the spirit of an uniareasoning brute, yet
   would it be but a foolish thought and an unaccomplished design. Now as
   Nature thus displays her unconquerable power, and her superiority to
   the despotism of all opposing volitions"s, shall the unchanging and
   undying essence of God alone yield itself to be shackled by the will?
   Wonderful thought! Shall that which guards with watchful care all
   essences, and conserves each in its sphere, shall that alone be thusm ,
   easily driven from the bounds of impassibility, and God the Creator
   possess less inflexibility than he has bestowed on every creature? But
   let us inquire of what prophet or apostle they receive this erroneous
   doctrine, that he thus willed? FProm none. The error springs from and
   rests on the light authority of those who maintain it. We have neither
   read he suffered, nor found he willed to suffer. What holy man ever saw
   suffer the invisible and impassible God, or to whom hath he revealed
   sucholx a will? 7 O0, the boldness of man to trample over invisible
   powers@! ForPot who hath ascended into heaven! who transcended thrones,
   principalities, powers, dominions, majesties? Who hath flown beyond the
   flight of the seraphim? Who hath seen the things concealed from their
   eyes? Who hath found out the nature of God in volition and suffering,
   when, the Scriptures have niaot revealed it? We have heard that -he
   hwliath performed his good pleasure; but that, he suffered, anaiad
   because he willed, we have nowhere learned. Why, then, miningle
   instability with unchangeabilit,y ? This is madness, not wisdom. The
   truth is the reverse of this. Christ suffered indeed, but it was in the
   flesh of mortal men, and not in his immortal Word.

   AGAINST THOSE WHO ASSERT THAT THE EXPRESSIONS OF SCRIPTURE SHOULD BE
   RECEIVED LITERALLY, WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR:IIL TRUE MEANING AND
   SPIRITUAL IMDIPORT.

   With great difficulty are those silenced who would subvert the
   constitution of the human mind, restraining men from the exercise of
   reason, and from the knowledge of natural truth and loveliness, by
   telling their followers that the expressions of Holy Writ are to be
   received literally, without examination, without discussion, without
   comparison, and without reference to the end for which they have been
   uttered. If, then, as they counsel, men should overlook the end and the
   meaning of the expressions of Scripture, and receive them literally and
   irrationally, would it not be to allow the words of apostles and
   prophets to echo through the ears in vain and unfruitful sounds, while
   the heart remained untouched and unaffected? When they advise to listen
   with the ears, but strive not for that fruitful perception which
   belongs to the heart, and the curse that attaches to them, to listen
   with the ears and not perceive. Thus they say, the phrase "the Word
   became flesh," is to be understood literally, and not in the sense
   pious reason wouald put upon the words; as if it were in their power to
   wrest the conception of any person from that which is befitting and
   profitable to that which pleases themselves. Shall I listen to words,
   and seek not for the idea intended thereby to be conveyed? Where, then,
   would be the results of discourse and the profit of listening? How
   quickly would they transform men into unreasoning beasts by such
   propositionspropostions; to listen to sounds of words and neglect the
   sounds of reason. Paul, who was a teacher in such affairs, did not thus
   instruct; his precepts were, to receive nothing save upon the sanction
   of right reason; thus, solid food belongs to strong men, who by
   exercise are able to discriminate between good and evil. He advises
   perfection, praises exercise, recommends sober judgmentjudgement
   between good ,and evil. But how can he judge who discerns not the
   matters revealed? For as the man whose senses are disordered by disease
   has no true perception of alimnients nor their properties, so the man
   who, from idleness or stolidity, is unexercised in his mental
   faculties, apprehends the words he hears, but gathers not the force of
   the argument, nor perceives the distinctions in the ideas intended to
   be conveyed. His participation is heedless aad irrational, like the
   beast who devours the nutritive and hurtful as they may chance to
   offer. Nor is he to be numbered among clean beasts, since he does not
   ruminate, but transmits a crude and unprepared mass of mental food to
   the inner man. Thus he receives injury from imperfect digestion, rather
   than support to his vital powers. Is any one ignorant that the command
   of the Divine law enjoins a scrutiny upon him who is bidden to sup at
   the table of a ruler, and diligently to consider what is placed before
   him? Thus, it is manifest that we are not to make the words of
   Scripture our prey, but we must consider what is fitting to God, useful
   to man, consonant with truth, in harmony with the law, responsive to
   nature; to that which faith may know, on which hope may build and the
   sincerity of love adopt, whereby the glory of God may shine
   untarnished, envy be vanquished, grace justified. These elements
   co-exist in the meditations of piety, but find no place in these absurd
   novelties, whose dependence is upon mad theories. To conclude, he who
   receives the text of Scripture literally and neglects the meaning
   cannot understand passages that seem to clash; he can find no proper
   solution thereto, give no answer to inquiries, and cannot fulfil the
   precept, be careful always to have that whereby thou mayest answer him
   who inquires.




   AGAINST THOSE WHO ASSERT THAT GOD

   THE WORD SUFFERED IN FLESH.



   I wonder that the inventors of these new doctrines seem never tired in
   their search or introduction of novelties, but are always frivolously
   propounding theories like the one we now proceed to confute, that God
   the Word suffered in the flesh. In this proposition there is much that
   is irrational, and much that is untrue. It is irrational to say one
   nature suffered in another; untrue to say the Word suffered. That which
   they would not dare to express unqualifiedly they conceal by the
   addition of "the flesh;" thus they would cover up this revolting idea,
   in the same manner as is an ugly face, by a deceitful mask. If the Word
   suffered, he suffered in his own essence. If aught else suffered, then
   the Word did not suffer, unless that injury which was directed alone
   against the suffering body may be considered as recoiling on the Word
   thereto united. To say, however, the Word suffered in the flesh is
   unscriptural, untrue, self-contradictory. But as these men are
   unbounded in impiety, and are conscious that pious ears will not listen
   to the expression "the Word suffered," they subjoin the expression "the
   flesh," @ in order to heal the wounds wrought by the other. Thus they
   would introduce disease, and heal by improper remedies; i for none of
   these doctrines are conson.uant with truth; and frequently in the same
   sentence are contained contradictions, so that rational men can give
   them no attention. The Word was not rendered passible by being joined
   to the flesh, nor was the flesh impassible through the agency of the
   Word; but as the body, by its nature, admitted the infl@uence of
   suffering, so the Word retained impassibility, as an essential and
   inseparable attribute. If the Word suffered,, why subjoin the additionu
   "llin the fllesh?" Why mniention the fliesh? The body suffered with the
   Word, or it did not. If it did nduot suffer, impassibility was bestowed
   on it. If it suffered, then the proof is that both natures suffered;
   for, as they say, the Word suffered in the flesh, and the body, by its
   own constitution, suffered in its proper nature. But perhaps the
   declaration of the apostle may be urged, "Of whom, as concerning the
   flesh, is Christ."tlxe dwkratiou of the apostle may be as concerning
   the flesh, is Christ.@" Say

   Christ suffered,@ and the word flesh recurs in the same manner. He who
   names God the Word names a pure essence; he who names :Chrisat
   designates one in whom two natures are united; and, thus@ it is with
   propriety we say Christ suffered, because this namane implies at once
   the impassible Word and the body which tasted death. Wherefore Paul did
   not use the expression, of whom is the pure God after the flesh, but "
   Of whom is Christ after the flesh," in order that he might indicate him
   who was intended of the Israelites, as pertains to the body; but as
   pertains to his divini@ty, the begot@ten of God the Father. He did not
   say of whom is God after the flesh. But say this, if you would convince
   me Christ suffered in the flesh. And if you pl " ease to say God
   suffered in the flesh, then tell me, are God and the flesh the same, or
   different in nature? If they are the same, then did God suffer in his
   own nature ; for God and the flesh are in nature the same. But if they
   are different, how does the one suffer in the other, since suffering
   induces no change in the essence? Thus man does not suffer in a horse;
   the soul dies not in the flesh, but the flesh is dissolved, and the
   soul separated therefrom; i and yet the man, consisting of soul and
   body, is called dead, but yet only. in that nature which may die, that
   is, the body, not the immortal soul; for no one has ever said of the
   soul of man that it has died in the body; but the man, the union of
   soul and body, has died. Thus the Scriptures, when about to establish
   the immortality of the soul after death, say the just live forever. An
   appeal to Scripture condemns altogether these men; for, notwithstanding
   the number of prophets and apostles, we find nowhere an expression like
   theirs. On the other hand, that Christ suffered is universally
   announced. Christ, our passover, is offered for us. If Christ be
   passible, he died for our sins, according to the Scriptures. The cross
   is Christ's"s, the body Christ's"s, the blood Christ's"s. How is it
   possible that they can neglect so great a cloud of witnesses, and
   prefer their own private judgment to the authority of the Spirit? Thus
   they would violate the command which forbids to transgress the ancient
   landmarks that your fathers have placed, and would disregard the
   decision of the great and holy Council of Nice, the fathers of which
   council with unanimity have placed in their creed the name of the Lord
   Jesus Christ next to God the Father; and to him they have ascribed the
   lofty attributes of Godhead and the beneficial faculties of his own
   manhood: according to the words of the blessed Paul, other foundation
   can no man lay than is laid, namely, Jesus Christ. We have not
   abandoned that foundations--a recipient of glory in one nature, of
   suffering in the a other. If you name him God alone, how can you lay on
   him the needed passion? If you name him man al*one, then how can g- he
   contain the vast riches of incomprehensibleiucotdprehensi"bli glory! I
   But it is our duty to call him Christ; hereby he reaps the fruit of
   glory in the Godhead, while in his manhood he bears suffering, and in
   the inseparable union works all miracles, and bestows all blessings on
   the faithful. Thus the impassibility of the Deity, the reality of the
   passion, and the universal advantage of man-bi ina-n,kind are made
   sure., In this manner the clear word of truth, the foundation of
   unshaken fa&ith, the glorious greatness of the mystery, the mraarvel
   worthy of the credence of antiquity, the unfading beauty of orthodoxy,
   and the harmonious belief of all ages are displayed. To assert this new
   and wild doctrine, and condclemn all who deny that God the Word
   suffered in the flesh, is not only to oppose the men of this age, but
   to array an opposition to the doctors and teachers of all antiquity.
   Why do these men avoid the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in which we
   are commanded to believe? Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
   shalt be saved. It is lovely to fix the hope of salvation in this name;
   for there is no other name given among men whereby we may be saved. At
   the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of things heavenly and things
   terrestrial, and of things infernal, and every tongue shall confess
   that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. HI-le is
   judge of the living and dead. Stephen, when dying called on him: Lord
   Jesus receive my spirit. There is one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are
   all things; i he is Saviour, he is Redeemer. Christ is all these. Why,
   then, avoid that beloved name? It hath removed disease: "In the name of
   Jesus Christ, arise and walk."2@ It hath put to flight devils: "I
   command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, come out of
   her.".@2 How is it that, leaving this name; as if ungratefulungratefal
   to them, they assume an expression nowhere found among the holy
   writers: the Word suffered in the flesh!


























   AGAINST THOSE WHO INQUIRE WEwu6@qtiunwHY SHOULD THE

   JEWS BE PUNISHED


   IUNLESS IT WAS GOD WHOM THEY SLEW?

   Argument has no power to restrain the madness of contentious men. If we
   advance a thousand irrefragable arguments, though they may display the
   truth, yet will they fail to convince these framers of falsehood; for
   it is the punishment of those who, in despite of the clearest of
   demonstrations, have abandoned the truth, never to leave their own
   devices nor return to the true road ; but continuing to travel by
   headlong by-paths, they are not ashamed to interroga@te of us why the
   Jews shall be punished if they slew not God. Shameless and deceitful
   impudence! I To avesnnge Christ they asperse Christ. Thus, that the
   Jews may be punished, they would confuse all things, despise doctrine,
   blaspheme the impassible God by callingo him passible, revile God's"s
   glory, tear up the order of the universe. Cease to avenge God by
   blaspheming God; a defence joined with dishonoaur to the one defended
   is detestable. Leti Jews receive gain, if their loss is the shame of
   Christians. Rather let the guilty escape than he who suffered acquire
   such advocates. Better that Jews be pardoned than the GCodhead be
   reproached with mutability and paossibility. Why afford such a theme of
   boasting to Jews as that they were triumphant over God? They would have
   had no power over the temple had not the inmate permitted it, who
   raised the temple when dissolved, but himself remained indissoluble.
   Your opinion is contrary to the express announcement of the sufferer,
   and your vindication inflicts a worse grief than the injury you would
   avenge. Then wherefore distort the compassionate words of the Saviour
   Christ; for at the time of the passion he said, Father, forgive them;
   they know not what they do. And do you accuse the Jews of a knowledge
   of the presence of a God, and a conscious pollution of themselves with
   his blood? This audacity surpasses that of the crucifying Jews. They
   killed Christ, deeming him mere man. You, while vindicating God, call
   him mutable, passible, and dead. Thus, in proportion as that man is
   more criminal who is impious towards God than he who injures man, so is
   the state of him more dreadful who, in language, kills God the Word,
   than theirs who drove the nails into the flesh of the Lord. But though
   the Jews are less impious than you, we revoke not their awful doom. We
   maintain the impassibility of the Godhead of Christ, and ascribe
   passion to the manhood thereto united, and that the Jews shall be
   punished for impiety towards the manifest Deity through insane rashness
   and blindness. Even now we see that those who lift up impious hands
   against the temples of God and do this sacrilegiously and
   destructively, are punished as though they were impious criminals in
   respect of God, notwithstanding that their rage is outwardly directed
   against stones and wood. If then an inanimate temple be guarded by such
   severe laws, how much severer sanctions should protect that living and
   unpolluted temple joined ineffably and indissolubly to the living God!
   To offer injury or insult to that holy temple must be considered as
   offering injury and insult to the God who dwelt therein, and who
   distinguished it by so many miracles. Nor can the Jews find any
   palliation of their guilt in the circumstance that they appeared to sin
   against a mere man, while, to confute them, so many miracles wrought by
   his hand displayed the glorious majesty and power of the Godhead. His
   birth was pointed out by prophecy, its place was well known, its manner
   most remarkable, the time of its accomplishment made certain in every
   word in Scripture was declaratory of the event, the Oriental wise men
   came afar to worship, a star prognosticated, and angels sang the
   nativity of the Saviour. Herod the king was troubled; all Judea was
   filled with wonder, for it was the manifestation of him who should take
   away the sins of the world. Simeon takes the child in his arms, and
   calls him the salvation of God. Anna prophesies; John, at Jordan bears
   witness to him. The voice of the Father from heaven acknowledges him to
   all as the well-beloved Son; the descent of the Spirit as a dove on his
   head confirms and glorifies him; the water changed into wine, and five
   loaves multiplied to satisfy the hunger of as many thousands, while
   twelve baskets are filled with the fragments, attest his power.
   Diseases are healed by his word; devils, expelled by his command, bear
   witness from afar to the terror of his power; even the dead are at once
   rescued from the power of the grave; the very hem of his garment brings
   health to the sick woman, making evident the glory of the concealed
   God. Even the frame of universal nature, at the time of the, passion,
   and the destruction of the visible temple of his body, is disturbed in
   divers ways; and those who crucified him bore testimony to the reality
   of his resurrection; for, while they watched the slain, they were
   confounded by the omnipotence of the sufferer. These things, and many
   besides, evinced the hidden Godhead, and to be wilfully blind to these
   manifestations was a crime of deep impiety against God.

   AGAINST THOSE WHO CALL HIM A JEW WHO DENIES THAT GOD SUFFERED.

   In our former arguments the conclusions were so clear, and so variously
   and manifestly demonstrated, that our adversaries ought in all fairness
   to acknowledge their cogency; but this they do not, being intent upon
   weaving new and deceitful subtleties; Thus, they say he is a Jew who
   denies that God suffered. It is well that they remind us of a name well
   suited to themselves. They have drawn upon themselves affinity with
   Jews by denying the salvation of the incarnation, and by rejecting the
   mystery of the union of the two natures. Let us now imagine whether he
   is a Jew who receives the gospel of grace, or he who strives for the
   letter of the law! The gospel teaches us that the invisible God was
   manifest in visible flesh. The Jews maintain their ancient traditions,
   wherein the Deity is represented under types and forms. In what manner
   do we call others, Jews who reject the riches of the New Testament?

   Have we not heard that many prophets and just men have desired to see
   those things which we have seen, and have not been able? 7 What have
   they not seen? The God manifest in the flesh. Is it not written, God
   was seen by Abraham, by Isaac, by Jacob, by Moses, and by many others?
   That which they desired to see, and were not able, was that which we
   have seen, the ineffable and indissoluble union of Godhead and manhood.
   This is the strange sight revealed to all who by fa&ith confebss the
   adorable union of the Word and flesh. They who reject the assumption of
   human na, ture are convicted manifestly of affin@ity with the ancient
   Jews, who were unable to see the things we have seen. Jews are they who
   reject the incarnate mediation of the Saviour, and to these must those
   be added, or, rather, must be considered greater criminals, who deny
   the two natures. The Jews were unable to perceive the Deity, thoughlx
   working miracles among them; and these revilers of God
   attributeattribiate to the Word the infirmities them; and these of the
   flesh he assumed. But perhaps they will say (for they do not scruple to
   deny the most evident truths), we do not call the divine nature
   passible. Should we ask of you, ye cunning sophists, how is it
   possible, that you can avoid this assertion, you would make answer: He
   suffereqd because he so willed, and thus is not passible. In this
   manner you but avoid the letter, while in youear faith the error
   remains. If you condemn such as deny that God suffered, can you escape
   the inevitable conclusion, God is passible? If he be a Jew, in your
   opinion, who does not acknowledge that the divine nature suffered, and
   a Christian "Who believes it@ then the Jew thus confessing the divine
   impassibility must be preferred to you who deny it; for, of necessity,
   you must be called Jews, maintaining the impassibility, or Christians,
   as you would define the word, holding to the paossibility of God. Then
   tell us plainly to which doctrine you subscribe; for with the heart
   manm believes to justification, and with the mouth confession is made
   to salvation. If the Word did not suffer, then the flesh did suffer. If
   neither suffered, then somrae third essence suffered. If nothing
   suffered, then there was no passion. If the passion took place, and yet
   no one suffered, it was but an illusion; we are saved by a mere
   illusion. You are as impious as the Manicheans; and why do you hesitate
   to adopt their name, when manifesstly- you are inheritors of their
   heresy? Hence is your error shown to be worse than that of the Jews,
   and nearly as impious as that of the Manicheans. Why mention Jews and
   Manicheans? You are more resolved in guilt than he, the contriver of
   all evil and hater of all good---who hath planted these tares in your
   heart---the devil. He, when, at Jordan, the divine glory of the Saviour
   was manifested, though urged by the stings of envy, dared not begin the
   temptation till he saw Jesus fainting with hunger, an undoubted sign of
   human weakness. He well knew the attribute of the Godhead to be subject
   to neither temptation nor passion. You ascribe to the Godhead hunger,
   thirst, and similar infirmities, and dare annex the suffering of
   crucnoifixion thereto. He (the devil), for the magnitude of his guilt,
   was called a murderer from the beginning; you, in the greatness of your
   mad impiety towards God, call the Jews the slayers of God, and do not
   blush in allowiing greater power to the Jews, " the disciples, than to
   the devil, the teacher of all wickedness; and thus, according to the
   accusation of the Scripture, knowing God, you have not glorified him as
   God; fobr you have maintained his passibility.---(Athanitasius's"s
   Worksv, vol. 2,iL pp. 305-31830 l@, Ed. of Cologgne, 1686.)

   THE BLOODY SWEAT,

   REFERRED TO AT PAGES 207 AND 222

   Some of the adherents of the prevalent theory, in accordance with their
   custom of transmuting into metaphor such hbr saeh scriptural 9 passages
   as oppose their dogma, have expressed their belief that the bloody
   sweat of Gethsemane was but a figure of speech. St. Luke was a writer
   of the greatest simraplicity and directness; he was a stranger to
   amplification or hyperbole, and dealt little in metaphor. Had he sought
   a rhetorical figure to indicate the profuse perspiration of his Lord,
   great drops of water would have been a more natural and apposite
   comparison than great drops of blood. The thought of blood would not
   have been likely to enter the imagination of the evangelist, had not
   the Holy Ghost impressed on him the awfulawfal phenomenon of the
   garden.

   But the great majority of those who profess the prevalent theory feel
   themselves bound to admit the sweat of blood at Gethsemane. They seek,
   however, to evade its hostile bearinug upon their theory, by affirming
   that history records many other instances of bloody perspiration,
   caused, not only by corporeal disease, but also by extreme mental
   agonoiay. And to sustain a proposition so important to their dogma@
   they cite the following authorities: Aristotle, Hist. Anim. Tom. I1.
   lib. 3iii. chap. 19, page 809. Ibid. de part Anim. Tom. I. lib. 3iii.

   THE BLOODY SWEAT. 353

   It is, indeed, true that bodily disease has sometimes caused an
   exudation of blood, by debilitating the system, and rendering the veins
   and arteries incapable of retaining and circulating their vital fluid.
   And it is, no doubt, also true, that mental agony, if intense and
   protracted may, at least in feeble subjects, superinduce bodily
   disease, with all its frightfu"al consequences. But we cannot yield our
   credence to the proposition that spiritual agony, unaccompanied by
   corporeal infirmity, has ever forced through the healthful body great
   drops of blood, save in the garden of Gethsemane.

   Aristotle, in one of the quoted pages, says; "If much blood is lost,
   life languishes; if the loss is extreme, life is extinguished. When the
   blood is immoderately charged with humours, disease attacks; for then
   it is converted into a thin unnatural state, and has, in some cases,
   broken out into a bloody sweat." And in the other quoted page of his
   writings, he says: "Some through an ill habit of body have sweat a
   bloody excrement."al It will be perceived that - thist learned I
   "scholar attributes bloody exudations to corporeal disease. If they had
   ever been caused by mental agony, it seems to have escaped the
   knowledge of the profound Stagyrite. Diodorus Sioulus, in the page of
   his works referred to, is speaking of the Indian serpents, and
   observes: " If any one be bitten by them, he is tormented with
   excessive pains, and seized with a bloody sweat."@@ The Roman scholar
   gives no more intimation, than did his Greek predecessor, that bloody
   perspiration is ever caused by meore mental agony. Voltaire, in his
   Universal History, thus describes the death-sickness of Charles IX. of
   Trance:

   "He died in his thirty-@fifth year; his disorder was of a very
   remarkable kind; the blood oozed out of all his pores. This malady, of
   which there have been other instances, was owing, either to excessive
   fear, or violent agitation, or to a feverish and melancholy
   temperament." The only fact here recorded is that the king was sick
   unto death; and that, in his last illness, his blood oozed out from his
   pores. The cause of his illness and of the symptom stated, is left to
   rest on vaguae conjecture. The quotation from Voltaire is no proof of
   the proposition advanced by our opponents; his conjectures are not
   entitled to controlling influence in a Christian iInvestigation.

   The advocates of the prevalent theory have referred to Sir r

   John Chardin'?s History of Persia. We believe that such a work

   30*

   054 APPENDIX NO. ".

   was never written by the author referred to. He travelled in Persia@
   and published his travels in several volumes, which is, doubtless, the
   production intended. Though not an Englishman, his first volume (to
   which alone the reference of our opponents points) was translated into
   English under his own superintendence, and originally published by ,him
   at London. Afterwards all the volumes were published on the continent,
   in French. The English copy may, therefore, be regarded as the true
   original of his first volume. We have examrained it, and found no
   mention of a bloody perspiration in the page cited, or elsewhere in the
   volume. To the continental edition we have not had access. If the
   learned reader should find any thing in the English volume which has
   escaped our notice, or anything superadded in the continental edition,
   we would beg leave to remindremincl, him, that Sir J"ohn Chardin,
   though reputed to be a writer of truth, travelled in the land of
   exaggeration and romance. What he recorded from his own observation, is
   entitled to fair credit; what he recorded from Persian hearsay should
   be taken with many grains of allowance.

   Our opponents have also referred to Thuanuiis (the celebrated French de
   Thou) HisL,3t. Temp. lib. 10x. "pPage 221. We find no such page in his
   tenth book; nor do we find in any part of the book any allusion to
   bloodyv perspiration. Thuanus is a very voluminous writer; and our
   leisure has not allowed us to explore his history page by page. The
   learned reader@@, if he shall discover theif the passage intended by
   the reference, will please to bear in mind, in testing its
   applicability, that the point "Oh@ -here at issue between the advocates
   of the prevalent theory and ourselves, is, not whether bloody
   exudations have occurred elsewhere than at Gethsemane, but whether such
   other cases were caused by spiritual agony, unaccompanied by corporeal
   disease.

   Two cases of bloody exudations are reported @@ @in Acta@ Physico-

   Med. NorimbergæNorimber@. The one was@ that of a boy about twelve years
   old, who had long suffered under a succession of complicated diseases,
   but who had not been the subject of any .special mental agony. Of
   course it has no bearing on the point in issue. The other case requires
   more consideration. It is, thus nar@ra@ted: " Joachimus Scacerna, in
   the sixty-secondd6iftcl year of his age, apparently in health, met me,
   about noonii in th"ne month of November, deeply distressed, and asked
   my -advice, saying that he had been accused by somebody of the crime of
   perjury, and expressing his fears lest he should be cast into prison.
   Touched with compassion for his calamity, I observed red tears flowing
   from his eyes, of the appearance of blood. Offering him such
   consolation as was in my power, I left him. He was afterwards led to
   prison by the guards, much afflicted, shedding bloody tears, shaking
   with agues through his whole system, followed by a malignant fever,
   which terminated his life in three days."2@

   It is manifest from the preceding narration, that the malignant and
   mortal fever had seized upon its victim before he met the narrator. It
   was doubtless the occult fever that caused the mental distress, and not
   the mental distress that caused the fever. There is no proof that the
   unfortunate man had committed the crime of perjury, or that in fact he
   had been accused of such crime. It was probably the delirium of inward
   disease that made him imagine himself accused. It may be inferred that
   it was his self-accusation - alone which cast him into prison. Had he
   been guilty, or had he been frightened If a frigumed into mental agony
   by a false uso Are charge, flight would have been more probable than
   his gratuitous disclosure to the narrator. That the narrator did not
   detect the incipient disease, need not excite our wonder. It is not
   quite certain that he was a physician; and, if he was, it is clear that
   the dying man did not come to him for medical advice; for he thought
   himself well. It was not an interview between physician and patient.
   Their meeting seems to have been a casual and brief one, perhaps in the
   street. That the disease was susLifficiently virulent to have affected
   and deranged the veins and arteries and pores and fluids of the system,
   is proved by its rapid progress and fatal termination. t.@l Since time
   began, countlt ess millions have, in every age, been justly or unjustly
   accused of crime; but none, befobre or since the narrated case, 2 ever
   exhibited, under the mere influence of the accusation, a sweat of
   blood. The gory exudation in the narrated cas, @e, if it had no cause
   but the accusation, would stand opposed -to "the whole course of human
   experience, and require nearly the same plenitude of proof for its
   confirmation that wouald be required to prove a miracle. If the
   unfortunate JSoachimus Sceacerna shed bloody tears because he was
   charged with an offence, he did what we suppose no other accused person
   has ever done, from the arraignment of Cain to the present hour.

   We have read the Rev. Mr. Farneworth's"s translation of Leti's@

   356 APPENDIX NO."

   Life of Pope Sextus V, another authority refetbrred to by the advocates
   of the prevalent theory, and find in it no case of bloody perspiration.
   We have not had access to .the original; niiaor should we take much
   pains -to examine it in detail, after learning the characoter of the
   author for historical fidelity. Chalmers, in his Biographical
   Dictionary, article Leti, thus speaks of him: "We know febw writers of
   history who are less to be depended on, having debased all his
   productions with fable. It is impossible to give credit to him, unless
   his facts can be supported by other authority." Doctor Rees, in his
   Cyclopæoedia, article Leti, is scarcely less severe. He observes: "Leti
   was a most industrious writer; his works are said to amount to a
   hundred volume.s. Most of them are historical; but they are frequently
   destitute of truth, and cannot be relied on unless supported by other
   authority than the dictum of the writer.@" ]Farnesworth, his own
   translator, thus speaks in his preface of the work translated: "When
   he" 71 (Leti) "i@ wrote his history, he seems to have been far advanced
   in years, or at least in the decline of life, and got into a talkative
   stage;" and he informs us elsewhere in his preface that he did not
   think fit to translate all his author wrote. Whatever is said in the
   original work of perspiration of blood, was probably deemed fabulouns
   by the translator, and for that cause omitted in the translation. After
   this exposition, it is not likely that the advocate of the theory will
   place great reliance on the authority of Leti.

   We suppose that, at the commencement of, his last passion,Ma @",
   pusion, Christ possessed the most perfect health. He had @l,@led a life
   of regular exercise, and of extreme temperance. He had breathed an air
   then pure and salunbrioulis; aniad attained the age deemed, in that
   climate, the acme of bodily vigour. His bloody sweat seems to have
   subsided with the mitigation of the intense agony which caused it, and
   does not appear to have been attended or succeeded by corporeal
   disease. Had his body streamed with gory perspi ration when he appeared
   before the high priests and Roman governors and soldiery, the fact
   would have excited universal astonishment, and been likely to find its
   way into profane history. The four evangelists would scarcely have
   passed it over in silence.

   The crucifixion morning found our blessed Lord, as we suppose, in
   unimpaired health. The Jehovah of the Old Testament declared that the
   sacrifice of any sickly or blemished animal was an abomination in his
   sight.---Deutecronomy, 17xvii. 1. The holy

   THE BLOODY SWEAT. 357

   Christ of the New Testament, when making the great sacrifice for the
   sins of our race, of which the Jewish oablations were but the
   prefiguring types, offered up himself on the altar of eternal justice,
   free, no doubt, from disease or imperfection, as @" "a lamb without
   blemish and without spot."2l---l Peter 1i. 19. We conclude that the
   bloody sweat of the garden, caused by spiritual agony, and neither
   attended or followed by corporeal ailment, was a phenomenon altogether
   unique, finding no parallel in the annals of the world.

   For this he pleads in heaven.

   H. 846, v. 4

   METHODIST.

   Agonizing in the garden,

   Lo! your Maker prostrate lies!

   H. 2, v. 5.

   Sinners, turn, why will ye die?

   God your Saviour asks you why!

   God, who did your souls retrieve,

   Died himself that ye might live.

   H. 4, v. 2.

   Jehovah, in thy person show,

   Jehovah crucified!

   H. 32, v. 7.

   Let me see, and let me feel,

   Sins that crucified my God.

   H. 52, v. 2.

   My worthless heart to gain,

   The God of all that breathe

   Was found in fashion as a man,

   And died a cursed death.

   H. 67, v. 6.

   , love divine, what hast then done!

   Th' immortal God hath died for me!

   The Father's co-eternal Son

   Bore all my sins upon the tree!

   The immortal God for me hath died:

   My Lord, my love, is crucified.

   Behold him, all ye that pass by,

   The bleeding Prince of life and peace!

   Come see, ye worms, your Maker die,

   And say, was ever grief like his.

   H. 187, v. 1, 2.

   Well might the sun in darkness hide,

   And shut his glories in;

   When Christ, the mighty Maker, died,

   For man the creature's sin!

   H. 191, v. 3.

   Where is the King of glory now?

   The everlasting Son of God?

   Th' Immortal hangs his languid brow;

   The Almighty faints beneath his load!

   H.194, v. 7.

   The earth could to her centre quake,

   Convulsed while her Creator died.

   H. 195. v. 3.

   Earth's profoundest centre quakes,

   The great Jehovah dies!

   H. 196, v. 1.

   Now discern the Deity,

   Now his heavenly birth declare!

   Faith cries out, "Tis he, tis he,

   My God that suffers there."

   H. 200, v. 3.

   And view thee bleeding on the tree,

   My God, who died for me, for me!

   H. 227, v. 3.

   The day of Christ, the day of God,

   We humbly hope with joy to see,

   Wash'd in the sanctifying blood

   Of an expiring Deity.

   H. 284, v. 1.

   'Tis mystery all! th' Immortal dies!

   H. 287, v. 2.

   He left his Father's throne above;

   (So free, so infinite his grace!)

   Emptied himself of all but love,

   And bled for Adam's helpless race.

   H. 287, v. 3.

   I thirst for a life-giving God,

   A God that on Calvary died.

   H. 319, v. 2.

   I see thy garments roll'd in blood,

   Thy streaming head, thy hands, thy side:

   All hail, thou suff'ring, conquering God!

   Now man shall live, for Christ hath died.

   H. 354, v. 3.

   The rising God forsakes the tomb;

   (In vain the tomb forbids his rise.)

   H. 524, v. 2.

   EXTRACTS FROM SERMONS AND OTHER WRITINGS BY

   AUTHORS PROFESSING THE PREVALENT THEORY.

   REFERRED TO AT PAGE 325.

   "Nay, God is so ready in his mercy that he did pardon us, even before
   he redeemed us.--For what is the secret of the mystery that the eternal
   Son should take upon him our nature, and die our death, and suffer for
   our sins, and do our work and enable us to do our own? He that did this
   is God."

   "Indeed we were angry with God, at enmity with the Prince of life; but
   he was reconciled to us as far, as that he then did the greatest thing
   in the world for us; for nothing could be greater than that God, the
   Son of God, should die for us."

   JEREMY TAYLOR.--Sermons, Boston edition of 1816, vol. 2, page 531,

   On Miracles of Divine Mercy.

   "That God should vouchsafe to become man, to reconcile man to God; that
   he should come down from heaven to earth, to raise us from earth to
   heaven; that he should assume our vile and frail and mortal nature,
   that he might clothe us with glory and honour and immortality; that he
   should suffer death to save us from hell, and shed his blood to
   purchase eternal redemption for us!"

   TILLOTSON.--Works, vol. 3, page 40, Sermon on Divinity of our Lord.

   The hiding the majesty of God under the form of a servant; his descent,
   not only to the earth, the lowest dregs of the world, the footstool of
   the Divinity, but to the most abject and forlorn condition in that
   earth; his taking the similitude of weak flesh, and running through all
   the degrees of reproaches and punishment, even to the grave itself,
   were voluntary acts, the workings of his love, that he might rescue us
   from a deserved hell, to advance us to an undeserved heaven, and make
   us partakers of that blessedness he had voluntarily quitted for our
   sakes."

   "In all his sufferings he retained the relation and reality of the Son
   of God; the unity of his natures remained firm in all his passions, and
   therefore the efficacy of the Deity mingled itself with every groan in
   his agony, every pang and cry upon the cross, as well as with the blood
   which was shed; and as his blood was the blood of God,--Acts, 20.
   28,--so his groans were the groans of God, his pangs were the pangs of
   God."

   CHARNOCK.--Works, vol. 2, pages 876, 900

   "Let it be counted folly, or frenzy, or fury, whatsoever, it is our
   comfort and our wisdom; we care for no knowledge in the world but this,
   that man hath sinned, and God hath suffered; that God hath made himself
   the son of man, and that men are made the righteousness of God."

   HOOKER.-- Works, vol. 3, page 341, Discourse of Justification.

   "Especially considering the greatness of the person that suffered it;
   not a mere man, not an angel, not an archangel, but the only begotten
   Son of God, of the same essence and glory with the Father. This the
   apostle takes special notice of in this very chapter, where, speaking
   of the Jews crucifying Christ, he saith "they crucified the Lord of
   glory,"--1 Corinthians, 2. 8; which is the same as if he had said, they
   crucified God himself."

   "Especially if you go but a little further into the garden; for there
   you see: oh, what do you see there? The saddest spectacle that ever
   mortal eye as yet beheld; even the Son of God, the only begotten of the
   Father, lying flat upon the ground."

   BEVERIDGE.--Sermons, vol. 1, pages 156, 157, 540.

   1 "We should, therefore, revolve often in our thoughts this great
   mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh, dying on the cross, to
   destroy the works of the devil."

   ATTERBURY.--Sermons, vol. 4, pages 175, 176, Glorifying in Cross of
   Christ.

   "Jesus expires; the dead leave their tombs; the sun withdraws his
   light; nature is convulsed at the sight of her Creator dying upon a
   cross."

   "The earth trembles, as refusing to support the wretches, whose
   sacrilegious hands were attacking the life of Him who fastened the
   foundations thereof,--Job. 38. 6; and founded it upon its
   basis.--Psalms, 104. 5.

   SAURIN.--Sermons, vol. 6, pages 114, 135; second Am. edition.

   "Wonder not, saith St. Cyril, the Catechist, if the whole world was
   redeemed; for it was not a bare man, but the only Son of God that died
   for it." "But a farther height; a perfect immensity, indeed, of worth
   and efficacy, must needs accrue to the death of our Saviour from his
   being the Son of God; from his being God, (one and the same in nature
   with his almighty and all-glorious Father;) for it is the blood of
   Christ the Son of God, which purgeth us from all sin; yea, God himself
   did as St. Paul saith in the Acts, purchase the church with his own
   blood; it is the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave
   himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity; and Hereby,'
   saith St. John, perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his
   life for us.' That the immortal God should die, that the Most High
   should be debased to so low a condition, as it cannot be heard without
   wonder, so it could not be undertaken without huge reason, nor
   accomplished without mighty effect."

   BARROW.--Sermons, vol. 4, page 500; vol. 5, page- 12.

   "When our Saviour fasted forty days, there was no other person hungry
   than that Son of God who made the worlds; when he sat down weary by the
   well, there was no other person felt that thirst but he who was the
   eternally begotten of the Father, the fountain of the Deity: when he
   was buffeted and scourged, there was no other person sensible of those
   pains than that eternal Word, who, before all worlds, was impassible:
   when he was crucified and died, there was no other person which gave up
   the ghost but the Son of Him, and so of the same nature with Him who
   only hath immortality.'"

   PEARSON.--On the Creed, page 311.

   "This could only be effected by the wonderful scheme in which Mercy and
   Truth are made to kiss each other; when the same God who, in one person
   exacts the punishment, in another himself sustains it; and thus makes
   his own mercy pay the satisfaction to his own justice."

   HORSLEY--Sermons, page 92, On the Water and Blood of Christ.

   "It was no less a person than the eternal and only begotten Son of God,
   who was before all worlds, the brightness of his Father's glory and the
   express image of his person, who suffered in our stead."

   "That his eternal and well-beloved Son should veil his divine glory,
   clothe himself with human flesh, subject himself to a life of pain and
   suffering, and at last make his soul an offering for sin upon a cross!"

   WITHERSPOON.--Works, vol. 1, page 57; vol. 2, page 24.

   "Behold, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. If God
   so loved us-observe, the stress of the argument lies on this very
   point--so loved us-- as to deliver up his only Son to die a cursed
   death for our salvation. Beloved, what manner of love is this,
   wherewith God both loved us, so as to give his only Son, in glory equal
   with the Father, in majesty co-eternal? What manner of love is this,
   wherewith the only begotten Son of God hath so loved us, as to empty
   himself, as far as possible, of his eternal Godhead; as to divest
   himself of that glory which he had with the Father before the world
   began; as to take upon him the form of a servant, being found in
   fashion as a man; and then to humble himself still farther, being
   obedient unto death, even the death of the cross!'"

   "The Word, God the Son, was made flesh,' lived and died for our
   salvation."

   JOHN WESLEY.--Works, vol. 2, pages 44, 45, 407; New York edition of
   1831.*

   *It is probable that we have done injustice to the distinguished
   Wesley, by classing him among the friends of the prevalent theory. We
   have not found a sentence in all his writings indicative of his
   adhesion to its dogma. The passages quoted and the hymns imputed to
   him, strongly imply the contrary.

   "There is something so stupendous in the voluntary humiliation and
   death of him who claims to be the only begotten of the Father, the
   brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, that, to
   convince us of the fact, the most powerful and unequivocal testimony is
   indispensably necessary."

   "To create man, nothing was required but a word--He spake, and it was
   DONE. But to recover him from the ruin in which sin had involved him,
   it was necessary for the eternal Son to become incarnate, and the Lord
   of life to expire upon a cross."

   "Heaven, and the heaven of heavens could not contain him; yet he dwelt,
   to all appearance, in the body of an infant;--the invisible Creator
   clothed in human form,--the Ancient of days, cradled as an infant of
   days,--He, who upholdeth all things, sinking under a weight of
   suffering,--the Lord of life; the Lord of glory, expiring on a
   cross,--the Light of the world sustaining an awful eclipse,--the Sun of
   Righteousness immerged in the shadow of death!"

   "Nor was there any waste of life in that sacrifice; every portion of
   his infinite energy was requisite to the attainment of such an object;
   nothing less than the power that upholds all things was adequate to
   sustain the weight of human sin. He whose almighty influence diffuses
   itself through the heavens and earth, and preserves all orders of
   being, He alone endured our punishment; He "trod the wine-press
   alone.'"

   ROBERT HALL.-Works, vol. 1, pages 512, 513, 522; vol. 6, pages 298,
   300.
