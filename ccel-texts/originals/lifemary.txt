                                    PREFACE

   Clemens Brentano was a well-known and well-to-do German poet and
   writer. After he had met the German nun and mystic, Anna Emmerich, on
   September 24, 1818, he was so amazed, he decided to be her
   stenographer. He later wrote, "I feel that I must stay here, that I
   must not leave this admirable creature before her death. I feel that my
   mission is here, and that God has heard the prayer I made when I begged
   him to give me something to do for His glory that would not be above my
   strength. I shall endeavor to gather and preserve the treasures of
   grace that I have here before my eyes." So, daily, for six years, this
   writer sublimated his career to take dictation. Why? Because he could
   see that this was God's work.

   Beginning in 1818, Anna Katharina Emmerich dictated to Clemens Brentano
   over a period of 6 years various details about the life of Jesus Christ
   in chronological order. She had additional visions of "celebrated"
   events such as Christmas, Easter, and Saints Holidays when those feast
   days occurred in the Catholic Church. Anna's visions, as the reader
   will see, are quite detailed. Internal biblical "contradictions" are
   often straightforwardly explained away, though Anna, appears unaware
   that she does so. For example, the genealogy of Jesus is given both in
   Luke 3:28-38 and Matthew 1:1-16, and they obviously differ. However, by
   compiling the relationships that Anna relates in this text, it can be
   seen that one gospel is stating Jesus' genealogical descent through
   Jesus' foster-father, Joseph, and the other, through Mary.

   The primary additions to this new edition of The Life of the Blessed
   Virgin Mary are:
    1. Woodcut figures that were included in the German 1852 edition have
       been included.
    2. Archaic word usage and all spelling has been revised to modern
       American English.
    3. All place names and proper names have been updated to modern
       spelling norms.
    4. Textual omissions of previous editions have been corrected.
    5. German section titles, omitted by the English translator, have been
       translated and included.
    6. Some new footnotes have been added.

   Footnotes are typically concluded with initials in parenthesis.
   Footnotes without initials or initialed "Tr." are from Michael
   Palairet, CB are from Clemens Brentano, and SB from Sebastian Bullough.

                       I. ANCESTORS OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN

   Last night there came again before my soul everything that I had so
   often seen as a child concerning the life of the ancestors of the
   Blessed Virgin Mary. I saw it all in a series of pictures just as I did
   then. If only I could tell it all as I know it and have it before my
   eyes, it would certainly give great joy to the Pilgrim. [1] In my
   miserable state I was greatly revived by contemplating these pictures.
   As a child I was so certain of all I saw that if anyone told me any of
   the stories differently, I would say straight out: No, this is how it
   is.' And, indeed, I would have let myself be killed rather than deny
   that it was thus and not otherwise. Later on, life in the world
   confused me, and I kept silence. The inner certainty has, however,
   always remained with me, and last night I once more saw everything even
   to the smallest details.

   When I was a child, my thoughts were always taken up with the Crib and
   the Child Jesus and with the Mother of God, and I often wondered very
   much why people told me nothing about the family of the Blessed Virgin.
   I could not understand at all why so little had been written down about
   her ancestors and relations. In the great longing which I had, I then
   received a multitude of visions of the Blessed Virgin's ancestors. I
   must have seen them back to the fourth or fifth generation. I saw them
   always as wonderfully pious and simple people inspired by a quite
   extraordinary secret longing for the coming of the promised Messiah. I
   saw them always living amongst other men who, compared to them, seemed
   to me rough and barbarous. They themselves, I saw, were so quiet,
   gentle and kindly, that I often said to myself in great anxiety about
   them: O where can these good people find a refuge, how are they to
   escape from those rough, wicked men? I will seek them out and will be
   their servant, I will fly with them into a wood where they can hide
   themselves; I am sure I shall still be able to find them!' So clearly
   did I see them and believe in them, that I was always afraid and full
   of anxiety about them.

   I always saw these people leading a life of great self-denial. I often
   saw that those among them who were married bound themselves mutually to
   observe continence for a time; and this gave me much joy, though why
   this was I could not clearly say. They practiced these separations
   chiefly when they were occupied with all kinds of religious ceremonies,
   accompanied by incense and prayers. [2] From these I perceived that
   there were priests among them. I often saw them moving from one place
   to another, leaving large homesteads and retiring to smaller ones, in
   order to lead their lives undisturbed by wicked people.

   They were so devout and so full of longing towards God that I often saw
   them alone in the field by day, and by night, too, running about and
   crying to God with such intense desire that, in the hunger of their
   hearts, they tore open their garments at their breasts, as if God were
   about to burn Himself into their hearts with the hot rays of the sun,
   or to quench with the moonlight and starlight their thirst for the
   fulfillment of the Promise.

   I remember pictures like these came to me when, as a child or as a
   young girl, I was kneeling and praying to God, alone with the flock in
   the pastures, or at night on the high fields above our farm; or when,
   in Advent, I walked through the snow at midnight to the Rorate [3]
   devotions in St. James's Church at Coesfeld, three-quarters of an hour
   away from our cottage at Flamske. The evening before, and in the night,
   too, I prayed much for the poor souls in purgatory. I thought that in
   their lives they had perhaps not been eager enough for grace; perhaps
   they had given way to other desires for the creatures and goods of the
   world, had fallen into many faults, and were now yearning to be
   released. So I offered up my prayer and my longing to God our Savior
   for them, trying as it were to pay their debt for them. I got a little
   benefit, too, for myself, for I knew that the kind Holy Souls, in
   gratitude to me and because of their constant desire for help by
   prayers, would wake me at the right time and would not let me
   oversleep. And so they did; they floated round my bed like little
   flames, little dim, quiet flames, and woke me just in time for me to be
   able to offer up my morning prayer for them. Then I sprinkled myself
   and them with holy water, put on my clothes, and started on my way. I
   saw the poor little lights accompanying me in a regular procession; and
   on the way I sang with true heart's desire: Drop down dew, you heavens,
   from above, and let the clouds rain the Just One.' And as I sang, I saw
   here and there, in the wilderness and in the fields, the beloved
   ancestors of Our Blessed Lady running about and crying for the Messiah;
   and I did as they did, and came to Coesfeld always in time for the
   Rorate [4] Mass, even when the Holy Souls led me, as they sometimes
   did, a very long way round past all the Stations of the Cross.

   Now, in my visions of these beloved ancestors of the Blessed Virgin
   praying so hard in their hunger for God, they seemed to me strange
   indeed in their dress and in their way of living, and yet so near and
   so clear to me, that I still know and have before my eyes all their
   features and figures. And I kept asking myself: What manner of people
   are these? Everything is different from nowadays, yet there these
   people are, and all that I see has really happened!' And so I always
   used to hope that I might go to them.

   In all they did and in all they said and in their religious services,
   these good people were very decided and exact; and they made no
   lamentations except over the sufferings of their neighbors.

1. THE ANCESTORS OF ST. ANNE [5] --ESSENES.

   I had a detailed vision of the ancestors of St. Anne, the mother of the
   Blessed Virgin. They lived at Mara in the region of Mount Horeb, and
   were connected spiritually with a kind of very devout Israelites of
   whom I have seen a great deal. I will relate as much as I can recall
   about them. I was with these people almost the whole of yesterday, and
   if I had not been oppressed by so many visits, I should not have
   forgotten nearly all of what I saw.

   These devout Israelites who were connected with the ancestors of St.
   Anne were called Essenes or Essaees. They have, however, changed their
   name three times, for they were first called Eskarenes, then
   Chasidaees, and finally Essenes. Their first name, Eskarenes, came from
   the word Eskara or Azkara, which is the name for the part of the
   sacrifice belonging to God, and also for the sweet-smelling incense at
   the offering of wheaten flour. [6] The second name, Chasidaees, means
   merciful. [7] I cannot remember what the name Essenes comes from. [8]
   The way of life of these devout people is an inheritance from the time
   of Moses and Aaron and in particular from the priests who carried the
   Ark of the Covenant; but it was not until the period between Isaiah and
   Jeremiah that their way of life was regularly established. At the
   beginning there were not many of them; later on, however, their
   settlements in the Promised Land occupied a space twenty-four hours'
   journey long and thirty-six hours' journey broad. They did not come to
   the region of the Jordan until later; they lived mostly on the slopes
   of Mount Horeb and Mount Carmel, the home of Elijah.

   In the lifetime of St. Anne's grandparents, the Essenes had a spiritual
   head who lived on Mount Horeb. He was an aged prophet called Archos or
   Arkas. [9] Their organization was very like that of a religious order.
   All who wished to enter it had to undergo a year's tests, and the
   length of time for which they were accepted was decided by prophetic
   inspirations from above. The real members of the Order, who lived in a
   community, did not marry but lived in chastity; but there were others
   (who had formerly been in the Order or were attached to it) who married
   and carried out in their families, and with their children and
   household, something similar in many ways to the traditional discipline
   of the real Essenes. Their relation ship with these was like that
   between the lay members of a Catholic Third Order, or Tertiaries, and
   the professed priests of the Order. In all important matters,
   especially as to the marriages of their relations, these married
   Essenes always sought instruction and counsel from the aged prophet on
   Mount Horeb. St. Anne's grandparents belonged to this kind of married
   Essenes.

   Later there arose a third kind of Essenes who exaggerated everything
   and fell into great errors, and I saw that the others would have no
   dealings with them.

   The real Essenes were specially concerned with prophetic matters, and
   their head on Mount Horeb was often vouchsafed divine revelations in
   the cave of Elijah respecting the coming of the Messiah. He had
   knowledge of the family from which the mother of the Messiah was to
   come, and at the time that he gave prophetic advice to the grandparents
   of St. Anne in matters of marriage, he saw that the day of the Lord was
   approaching. He did not, however, know how long the birth of the
   Savior's mother might still be prevented or delayed by sin, and so he
   was always preaching penance, mortification, prayer, and inner
   sacrifice for this intention--pious exercises of which all Essenes had
   ever given the example.

   Until Isaiah assembled these people together and gave them a more
   regular organization, they were scattered about the land of Israel,
   leading lives of piety and intent on mortification They wore their
   clothes without mending them till they fell off their bodies. They
   fought particularly against sexual immorality, and often by mutual
   consent lived in continence for long periods, living in huts far
   removed from their wives. When they lived together as husband and wife,
   it was only with the intention of producing a holy offspring which
   might bring nearer the coming of the Savior. I saw them eating apart
   from their wives; the wife came to take her meal after the husband had
   left the table. There were ancestors of St. Anne and of other holy
   people among these early Essenes.

   Jeremiah too was connected with them, and the men called Sons of the
   Prophet' came from them. They often lived in the desert and round Mount
   Horeb and Carmel, and later I saw many of them in Egypt. I also saw
   that for a time they were driven away from Mount Horeb by war and were
   reassembled by new leaders. The Maccabees also belonged to them. They
   had a great devotion to Moses, and possessed a sacred piece of his
   clothing given by him to Aaron, from whom it had come down to them.
   This was their most precious relic, and I had a vision of some fifteen
   of them being killed in defending it. Their prophet leaders had
   knowledge of the secret mysteries of the Ark of the Covenant.

   The real Essenes who lived in chastity were indescribably pure and
   devout. They adopted children and brought them up to lead a very holy
   life. To be accepted as a member of the regular Order, a boy had to
   have reached the age of fourteen. Those who had been already tested had
   to undergo a year's novitiate, others two years. They did not carry on
   any form of trade, but exchanged the produce of their agriculture for
   whatever else they needed. If one of them had committed a grave sin, he
   was expelled from among them and excommunicated by their head. This
   excommunication had the force of that pronounced by Peter against
   Ananias, who was struck dead by it. Their head knew by prophetic
   inspiration who had committed sin. I also saw some Essenes undergoing
   penitential punishment; they were obliged to stand in a stiff robe with
   their arms extended immovably in sleeves lined with thorns.

   Mount Horeb was full of little caves, which formed the cells where they
   lived. An assembly hall of light wattlework had been built onto the
   mouth of one of the large caves. Here they came together at eleven
   o'clock in the morning and ate. Each had a small loaf of bread in front
   of him with a goblet. The head went from place to place and blessed
   each one's bread. After the meal they returned to their separate cells.
   In this assembly hall there was an altar on which stood little blessed
   loaves covered up; they were in some way sacred, and were, I think,
   distributed among the poor.

   The Essenes had a great number of doves, which were tame and ate out of
   their hands. They ate doves, but also used them in their ritual
   ceremonies. They said something over them and let them fly away. I saw,
   too, that they released lambs in the desert after saying something over
   them, as if they were to take their sins on them. [10]

   I saw them go three times a year to the Temple in Jerusalem. They had
   also priests among them whose special duty was the care of the sacred
   vestments; they cleaned them, contributed money for them, and also made
   new ones. I saw them engaged in cattle breeding and agriculture, but
   specially in gardening. Mount Horeb was full of gardens and fruit trees
   in the spaces between their huts. I saw many of them weaving and
   plaiting, and also embroidering priests' vestments. I did not see them
   producing silk; that came in bundles to be sold to them, and they
   exchanged other produce for it.

   In Jerusalem they had a quarter of their own to live in and a separate
   place in the Temple as well. The other Jews rather disliked them
   because of their austerity. I saw, too, that they sent presents to the
   Temple; for example, great bunches of grapes, carried by two people on
   a pole. They also sent lambs, but not to be slaughtered; I think they
   just let them run into a garden. I did not see the real Essenes
   offering bloody sacrifices in these later times. I saw that before they
   journeyed to the Temple they made a very rigorous preparation by
   prayer, fasting, and penance, including even scourgings. If one laden
   with sins went to the Temple and to the Holy of Holies without having
   made atonement by penance, he usually died on the spot. If on their
   journey, or in Jerusalem itself, they found anyone who was ill or in
   any way helpless, they did not go to the Temple until they had given
   him all the aid in their power.

   I saw that, in general, they employed themselves in healing. They
   gathered herbs and prepared potions. I saw also that those holy people
   whom I had seen some time before laying sick folk down on a bed of
   healing plants were Essenes. [11] I saw, too, that the Essenes healed
   the sick by the laying on of hands, or by stretching themselves on them
   with arms extended. I saw them also healing at a distance in a
   wonderful way, for the sick who could not come themselves sent a
   representative to whom everything was done as it would have been to the
   sick person. The time was noted, and the distant sick person was cured
   at that very hour.

   I saw that the Essenes on Horeb had in their caves recesses in the
   walls where bones, carefully wrapped in cotton and silk, were kept as
   sacred relics behind gratings. They were bones of prophets who had
   lived here, and also of the children of Israel who had died near here.
   There were little pots of green plants standing beside them. The
   Essenes used to light lamps and pray before the bones in veneration of
   them.

   All the unmarried Essenes who lived together in communities on Mount
   Horeb and elsewhere observed the greatest cleanliness. They wore long
   white robes. The head of the Essenes on Horeb wore wonderful priestly
   vestments during solemn religious services, after the manner of the
   high priest in Jerusalem, only shorter and not so magnificent. When he
   prayed and prophesied in the cave of Elijah on Mount Horeb, he always
   wore these sacred vestments, which consisted of about eight pieces.
   Amongst them was a very sacred relic, a sort of dalmatic or scapular,
   covering the breast and shoulders, which Moses had worn next to his
   body and had given to Aaron, from whom it had later descended to the
   Essenes. The prophet Archos, their head on Mount Horeb, always wore
   this dalmatic next his body when he was clothed in all his vestments
   and was praying for prophetic enlightenment. The lower part of his body
   was wrapped in a loincloth, while breast and shoulders were covered
   with this sacred garment, which I will describe as exactly as I can
   remember. It will probably be clearer if I cut out a sort of pattern of
   it in paper. [She then quickly cut the shape, shown in Figure 1, out of
   paper put together, saying:] This sacred scapulary had more or less
   this shape when spread out. Its stuff was woven as stiff as haircloth.
   On the middle of the breast and back was a triangular place of double
   thickness and as it were quilted. I cannot now say for certain what was
   between the layers. At the neck hole, part I, of the scapulary, a
   triangular piece was cut from A to B, and a ribbon or little strap ran
   across the top of the opening. Its lower point, B, was still attached
   to the scapulary, and the triangle could be let down to hide completely
   another opening over the breast. This other opening was cut from C to
   D, and below triangle E, was the place of the double thickness
   mentioned above. It was ribbed or quilted, and letters were fastened
   into it with little pins and on the inside with sharp little hooks
   sticking out and pricking the breast. On the cut-out triangle (which
   was also of double thickness) at the neck there was also something like
   letters. I do not now know what was inside these triangles. When the
   priest put on this sacred vestment, the upper triangle exactly covered
   the lower one. In the middle of the back there was another place, F,
   where the stuff was quilted and of two thicknesses, and here, too,
   there were letters and sharp pins.

   Figure 1. Pattern of a sacred Essene scapular which Moses had once
   worn.

   Over his scapulary the head of the Essenes wore a gray woolen tunic,
   and on this again a large full tunic made of white twisted silk, girt
   with a broad belt inscribed with letters. He had a kind of stole round
   the neck, crossed over the breast, and it was held fast under the
   girdle and hung down below his knees. The stole was fastened with three
   straps above and below the place where it was crossed. On this he put a
   vestment not unlike a chasuble, which was also made of white twisted
   silk. [She cut out a pattern of this vestment, shown in Figure 2, as it
   looked when spread out. Please refer to Figure 2, part II.] The back
   side, A, was narrow and came down to the ground; it had two bells
   attached to the lower hem, which tinkled with the priest's movements
   and called the people to the service. The front side, B, was shorter
   and broader and open from the neck hole, C, downwards. This front part
   had large openings, E, on the breast and below it, through which the
   stole and undergarment could be seen. These openings were held together
   in places by fastenings ornamented with letters and precious stones, D.
   The front and back of this vestment were held together by strips of
   stuff under the arms. [These were not shown in the pattern which she
   cut out.] Round the neck was an upright collar, hooked together in
   front. The priest's beard, divided in the middle of the chin, fell down
   over this collar.

   Figure 2. Patterns of an Essene sacred silk vestment and cloak.

   Over all this he finally put on a little cloak [Figure 2, part III] of
   white twisted silk. [Please refer to Figure 3 for a depiction of the
   full outfit.] It shimmered and shone and was fastened in front with
   three clasps ornamented with precious stones on which something was
   engraved. From both shoulders of his cloak there were fringes, tassels,
   and fruits hanging. Besides all this, he wore a short maniple on one
   arm. The headdress was, as far as I can remember, also of white silk,
   twisted into a round shape and padded, like a turban, yet resembling
   our priests' birettas to a certain extent, for at the top it had ridges
   like theirs and also a tuft of silk. A little plate of gold set with
   precious stones was fastened over the forehead.

   The Essenes were very austere and frugal in their way of living. They
   generally ate only fruit, which they often cultivated in their gardens.
   I saw that Archos usually ate a bitter yellow fruit. About 200 years
   before Christ's birth I saw near Jericho a very devout Essene called
   Chariot.

   Archos or Arkas, the old prophet on Mount Horeb, ruled over the Essenes
   for ninety years. I saw how St. Anne's grandmother questioned him about
   her own marriage. It is remarkable that it was always about female
   children that these prophets made predictions, and that Anna's
   ancestors and Anna herself had mostly daughters. It was as if the
   object of all their devotion and prayers was to obtain from God a
   blessing on pious mothers from whose descendants the Blessed Virgin,
   the mother of the Savior Himself, should spring, as well as the
   families of His precursor and of His servants and disciples.

   Figure 3. Head of the Essenes in sacred vestments.

   The place where the head of the Essenes on Mount Horeb prayed and
   prophesied was the cave where Elijah had dwelt. Many steps led to it up
   the mountain-side, and one entered the cave through a small cramped
   opening and down a few steps. The prophet Archos went in alone. For the
   Essenes this was as if the high priest in the Temple went into the
   Sanctissimum, for here was their Holy of Holies. Within there were
   several mysterious holy things, difficult to describe. I will tell what
   I can remember of them. I saw Anna's grandmother seeking counsel from
   the prophet Archos.

   Anna's grandmother came from Mara in the desert, where her family,
   which belonged to the married Essenes, owned property. Her name sounded
   to me like Moruni or Emorun. It was told me that this means something
   like good mother' or noble mother'. [12] When the time came for her to
   be married, she had several suitors, and I saw her go to the prophet
   Archos on Horeb for him to decide whom she was to accept. She went into
   a separate part of the large assembly hall and spoke to Archos, who was
   in the hall, through a grating, as if she were making her confession to
   him. It was Only in this way that women approached the place. I then
   saw Archos put on his ceremonial vestments, and ascend thus arrayed the
   many steps to the top of Mount Horeb, where he entered the cave of
   Elijah by the little door and down the steps. He shut the little door
   of the cave behind him, and opened a hole in the vaulting dimly
   illuminating the cave, the interior of which had been carefully
   hollowed out. Against the wall I saw a little altar carved out of the
   rock, and noticed, though not quite clearly, several sacred objects on
   it. On the altar were several pots with low-growing bushes of herbs.
   They were the herbs which grow as high as the hem of Jesus' garment.
   [13] I know this herb; it grows with us but less vigorously. The plants
   gave Archos some sort of indication in his prophetic knowledge
   according to whether they faded or flourished. In the middle between
   these little bushes of herbs I saw something like a little tree, taller
   than them, with leaves that looked yellowish and were twisted like
   snail shells. There seemed to me to be little figures on this tree. I
   cannot now say for certain whether this tree was living or was
   artificial, like the Tree of Jesse. [On the next day she said:] On this
   little tree with the twisted leaves could be seen, as on a tree of
   Jesse or genealogical table, how soon the coming of the Blessed Virgin
   was to be expected. It looked to me as if it were living and yet it
   seemed also to be a receptacle, for I saw that a blossoming branch was
   kept inside it. I think it was Aaron's rod, which had once been in the
   Ark of the Covenant. When Archos prayed in the cave of Elijah for a
   revelation on the occasion of a marriage among the Blessed Virgin's
   ancestors, he took this rod of Aaron into his hand. If the marriage was
   destined to take its place in the Blessed Virgin's ancestry, the rod
   put forth a bud which produced one or more flowers, among which single
   flowers were sometimes marked with the sign of the elect. Certain buds
   represented particular ancestors of Anna, and when these came to be
   married, Archos observed the buds in question and uttered his
   prophecies according to the manner in which they unfolded.

   The Essenes of Mount Horeb had, however, another holy relic in the cave
   of Elijah; nothing less than a part of the most holy mystery of the Ark
   of the Covenant which came into their possession when the Ark fell into
   the hands of enemies. [She spoke here uncertainly of a quarrel and of a
   schism among the Levites.] This holy thing, concealed in the Ark of the
   Covenant in the fear of God, was known only to the holiest of the high
   priests and to a few prophets, but I think that I learnt that it is in
   some way mentioned in the little-known secret books of the old Jewish
   thinkers. [14] It was no longer complete in the new Ark of the Covenant
   in the Temple as restored by Herod. It was no work of man's hands, it
   was a mystery, a most holy secret of the divine blessing on the coming
   of the Blessed Virgin full of grace, in whom by the overshadowing of
   the Holy Ghost the Word became Flesh and God became Man. Before the
   Babylonian captivity this holy thing had been whole in the Ark of the
   Covenant; I now saw part of it here in the possession of the Essenes.
   It was kept in a chalice of shining brown, which seemed to me to be
   made of a precious stone. They prophesied, too, with the help of this
   holy thing, which seemed sometimes to put forth as it were little buds.

   Archos, after entering the cave of Elijah, shut the door and knelt down
   in prayer. He looked up to the opening in the vaulting and threw
   himself face downwards on the ground. I then saw the prophetic
   knowledge that was given to him. He saw that from under the heart of
   Emorun, who was seeking his counsel, there grew as it were a rose tree
   with three branches, with a rose on each of them. The rose on the
   second branch was marked with a letter, I think an M. He saw still
   more. An angel wrote letters on the wall; I saw Archos rise up as if
   awaking and read these letters. I forget the details. He then went down
   from the cave, and announced to the maiden who was awaiting his answer
   that she was to marry and that her sixth suitor was to be her husband.
   She would bear a child, marked with a sign, who was chosen out as a
   vessel of election in preparation for the coming of the Savior.

   Hereupon Emorun married her sixth suitor, an Essene called Stolanus; he
   did not come from Mara, and as a result of his marriage and of his
   wife's possessions he was given another name, which I can no longer
   remember distinctly; it was pronounced in different ways and sounded
   like Garescha or Sarziri. [15] Stolanus and Emorun had three daughters,
   called, I remember, Ismeria and Emerentia, and a younger one whose
   name, I think, was Enue. They did not remain long at Mara, but moved
   later to Ephron. I saw that their daughters Ismeria and Emerentia both
   married in accordance with the prophetic counsels of the prophet on
   Horeb. (I can never understand why I have so often heard that Emerentia
   was the mother of Anna, for I always saw that it was Ismeria.) I will
   tell in God's name what I still have in my mind about these daughters
   of Stolanus and Emorun. [16]

   Emerentia married one Aphras or Ophras, a Levite. Of this marriage was
   born Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. A second daughter was
   named Enue like her mother's sister. At the time of Mary's birth she
   was already a widow. There was a third daughter, Rhoda, one of whose
   daughters was Mara, whom I saw present at the death of the Blessed
   Virgin.

   Ismeria married Eliud. They lived after the manner of the married
   Essenes in the region of Nazareth. They had inherited from their
   parents the tradition of discipline and continence in married life.
   Anna was one of their children. The firstborn of Ismeria and Eliud was
   a daughter called Sobe. Because this child did not bear the sign of the
   promise, they were much distressed and again went to the prophet on
   Mount Horeb to seek counsel. Archos exhorted them to betake themselves
   to prayer and sacrifice, and promised them consolation. After Sobe's
   birth, Ismeria remained barren for some eighteen years. When she again
   became pregnant by God's blessing, I saw that Ismeria was given a
   revelation at night. She saw an angel beside her bed writing a letter
   on the wall. It seems to me that it was again that letter M. Ismeria
   told her husband of it; he also had seen it in his sleep, but now,
   while awake, they both saw the sign on the wall. After three months
   Ismeria gave birth to St. Anne, who came into the world with that sign
   upon her body.

   In her fifth year Anna was, like the Blessed Virgin, taken to the
   school in the Temple, where she remained twelve years. She was brought
   home again in her seventeenth year, to find two children there--her
   little sister Maraha, who had been born while she was away, and a
   little son of her elder sister Sobe called Eliud. A year after this
   Ismeria fell mortally ill. As she lay dying she spoke to all her
   relations and presented Anna to them as the future mistress of the
   house. Then she spoke once more with Anna alone, telling her that she
   was a chosen vessel of grace, that she must marry, and must seek
   counsel from the prophet on Mount Horeb. Then she died.

   Sobe, Anna's elder sister, was married to Salomo. Besides her son Eliud
   she had a daughter, Mary Salome, who married Zebedee and was the mother
   of the apostles James and John. Sobe had a second daughter who was an
   aunt of the bridegroom of Cana and the mother of three disciples.
   Eliud, the son of Sobe and Salomo, was the second husband of the widow
   Maroni of Naim and the father of the boy raised by Jesus from the dead.

   Maraha, Anna's younger sister, was given the homestead in Sephoris when
   her father Eliud moved to the valley of Zabulon. She married and had a
   daughter and two sons, Arastaria and Cocharia, who became disciples.
   Anna had yet a third sister who was very poor and was the wife of a
   shepherd on Anna's pastures. She was often in Anna's house.

   Enue, the third daughter of Stolanus, married and lived between
   Bethlehem and Jericho. One of her descendants was with Jesus.

   Anna's great grandfather was a prophet. Eliud, her father, was of the
   tribe of Levi; her mother Ismeria was of the tribe of Benjamin. [17]
   Anna was born at Bethlehem, but afterwards her parents moved to
   Sephoris, four hours from Nazareth, where they had a house and land.
   They also owned land in the beautiful valley of Zabulon, one and a half
   hours from Sephoris and three hours from Nazareth. In the fine season
   of the year Anna's father was often with his family in the valley of
   Zabulon, [18] and after his wife's death he moved there altogether.
   This led to the connection with the parents of Joachim, whom Anna
   married. Joachim's father was called Matthat [19] and was the
   stepbrother of Jacob (father of St. Joseph) and of Joses. Matthat had
   settled in the valley of Zabulon.

   I saw Anna's ancestors helping to carry the Ark of the Covenant with
   great devotion and piety, and I saw also that they received from the
   holy thing therein rays of light which extended to their descendants,
   to Anna and the Blessed Virgin. Anna's parents were rich. This was
   clear to me because of their possessions; they had many oxen; but they
   kept nothing for themselves alone, they gave everything to the poor. I
   saw Anna as a child; she was not particularly beautiful, but yet more
   so than others. She was far less beautiful than Mary, but remarkably
   simple and childlike in her piety; I have always seen her like that,
   whether as girl, mother, or old, old woman. Indeed, whenever I saw a
   real childlike old peasant woman, it always made me think she is like
   Anna'. She had several other brothers and sisters, all married, but she
   did not wish to marry. She was particularly fond of her parents, and
   though she had at least six suitors, she rejected them all. After
   taking counsel, like her ancestors with the Essenes, she was directed
   to marry Joachim, whom she did not yet know, but who sought her in
   marriage when her father Eliud moved to the valley of Zabulon, the home
   of Joachim's father Matthat.

2. ST. ANNE AND ST. JOACHIM.

   Joachim was far from handsome. St. Joseph, though no longer young, was
   in comparison a very handsome man. Joachim was short and broad and at
   the same time thin, and though he was a wonderfully pious, holy man, I
   can't help laughing when I think of his appearance. Joachim was poor.
   He was related to St. Joseph in the following way: Joseph's grandfather
   was descended from David through Solomon and was called Matthan. He had
   two sons, Jacob and Joses. Jacob was the father of Joseph. When Matthan
   died, his widow married as her second husband Levi (descended from
   David through Nathan), and by him had Matthat, the father of Heli, also
   called Joachim. [20]

   Wooing was in those days a very simple affair. The suitors were quite
   awkward and bashful, and when the young people spoke to each other,
   they accepted the idea of marriage as something that had to be. If the
   bride-to-be said yes, the parents were glad, but if she said no and had
   reason for it, they were just as satisfied. If everything was settled
   between the parents, the betrothal followed in the synagogue of the
   place. The priest prayed at the holy place where the scrolls of the Law
   lay, the parents in their usual place. Meanwhile the betrothed couple
   went together into a room and discussed their plans and their marriage
   contract; if they were in agreement, they told their parents, and their
   parents told the priest, who came towards them and received their
   declaration. On the next day the wedding took place in the open air and
   with many ceremonies.

   Joachim and Anna were married in a little place with only a small
   school. Only one priest was present. Anna was about nineteen years old.
   They lived with Eliud, Anna's father. His house belonged to the town of
   Sephoris, but was some distance away from it, among a group of houses
   of which it was the largest. Here I think they lived for several years.
   There was something very distinguished about both of them; they were
   completely Jewish, but there was in them, unknown to themselves, a
   wonderful seriousness. I seldom saw them laugh, but they were certainly
   not sad when they began their married life. They had a serene and even
   character, and even in their young days they seemed a little like
   sedate old people. Often in my youth I have seen similar sedate young
   couples, and even then I used to say to myself, they are just like Anna
   and Joachim.

   Their parents were well-to-do; they had many flocks and herds,
   beautiful carpets and household things, and many manservants and
   maidservants. I never saw them cultivating the fields, but often saw
   them driving cattle out to pasture. They were very pious, devout,
   charitable, simple, and upright. They often divided their herds and
   everything else into three parts, and gave a third of the beasts to the
   Temple, driving them there themselves and handing them over to the
   Temple servants. The second part they gave to the poor or in answer to
   the requests of their relations, some of whom were generally there to
   drive the beasts away. The remainder, which was generally the worst,
   they kept for themselves. They lived very frugally and gave to all who
   asked. As a child I often used to think, Giving brings plenty; he who
   gives, receives twice in return', for I saw that their third always
   increased and that soon everything was in such abundance that they were
   able to make the three divisions again. They had many relations who
   were assembled in their house on all festive occasions, but I never saw
   much feasting. I saw them giving food to the poor now and then, but I
   never saw them having real banquets. When the family were together I
   generally saw them lying on the ground in a circle, speaking of God in
   eager expectation. I often saw bad men from their neighborhood watching
   them with ill will and bitterness as they spoke together, looking up to
   heaven so full of longing. They were kindly disposed towards these
   ill-wishers, however, and lost no opportunity of asking them to their
   house, where they gave them double shares of everything. I often saw
   these men violently and angrily demanding what the good people gave
   them in love and charity. There were poor people in their own family,
   and I often saw them being given a sheep or even several.

   The first child born to Anna in her father's house was a daughter, but
   she was not the child of promise. The signs which had been predicted
   were not present at her birth, which was attended by some trouble. I
   saw that Anna, when with child, was distressed about her servants. One
   of her maidservants had been led astray by a relation of Joachim. Anna,
   in great dismay at this infringement of the strict discipline of her
   house, reproached her somewhat severely for her fault, and the
   maidservant took her misfortune so to heart that she was delivered
   prematurely of a stillborn child. Anna was inconsolable over this,
   fearing that it was her fault, with the result that her child was also
   born too soon. Her daughter, however, did not die. Since this child had
   not the signs of the promise and was born too early, Anna looked upon
   this as a punishment of God, and was greatly distressed at what she
   believed to be her own sin. She had, however, great joy in her newborn
   little daughter, who was called Mary. She was a dear, good, gentle
   child, and I always saw her growing up rather strong and fat. Her
   parents were very fond of her, but they felt some uneasiness and
   distress because they realized that she was not the expected holy fruit
   of their union. They therefore did penance and lived in continence for
   a long time. Afterwards Anna remained barren, [21] which she looked
   upon as the result of her having sinned, and so redoubled all her good
   works. I saw her often by herself in earnest prayer; I saw, too, how
   they often lived apart from each other, gave alms, and sent sacrifices
   to the Temple.

   Anna and Joachim had lived with Anna's father Eliud for some seven
   years (as I could see by the age of their first child), when they
   decided to separate from their parents and settle in a house with land
   in the neighborhood of Nazareth that had come to them from Joachim's
   parents. There they intended in seclusion to begin their married life
   anew, and to bring down God's blessing on their union by a way of life
   more pleasing to Him. I saw this decision being taken in the family,
   and I saw Anna's parents making the arrangements for their children's
   new home. They divided their flocks and herds, setting apart for their
   children oxen, asses, and sheep, all much bigger than we have at home.
   All the household goods, crockery, and clothes were packed upon asses
   and oxen standing before the door. All the good people were so clever
   at packing the things up, and the beasts so intelligent in the way they
   took their loads and carried them off. We are not nearly so clever in
   packing things into carts as these people were in loading them onto
   beasts. They had beautiful household things; all the vessels were more
   delicate than nowadays, as if each had been made by the craftsman with
   special love and intention. I watched them packing the fragile jugs,
   decorated with beautiful ornamentation; they filled them with moss,
   wrapped more moss round them, and made them fast to both ends of a
   strap, so that they hung over the animal's backs, which were covered
   with bundles of colored rugs and garments. I saw them, too, packing up
   costly rugs heavily embroidered with gold; and the parents gave their
   departing children a heavy little lump in a pouch, no doubt a piece of
   precious metal.

   When everything was ready, the menservants and maidservants joined the
   procession, and drove the flocks and herds and the beasts of burden
   before them to the new home, which was some five or six hours' journey
   distant. I think it had belonged to Joachim's parents. After Anna and
   Joachim had taken leave of all friends and servants, with thanks and
   admonitions, they left their former home with much emotion and with
   good resolutions. Anna's mother was no longer alive, but I saw that the
   parents accompanied the couple to their new home. Perhaps Eliud had
   married again, or perhaps it was only Joachim's parents who were there.
   Mary Heli, Anna's elder daughter, who was about six or seven years old,
   was also of the party.

   Their new home lay in a pleasant hilly country; it was surrounded by
   meadows and trees, and was one and a half hours, or a good hour, to the
   west of Nazareth, on a height between the valley of Nazareth and the
   valley of Zabulon. A ravine with an avenue of terebinth trees led from
   the house in the direction of Nazareth. In front of the house was an
   enclosed courtyard, the floor of which looked to me like bare rock. It
   was surrounded by a low wall of rocks or rough stones, with a wattle
   hedge growing either on it or behind it. On one side of this court
   there were small, not very solid buildings for the workpeople and for
   storing tools of various kinds; also an open shed had been put up there
   for cattle and beasts of burden. There were several gardens, and in one
   near the house was a great tree of a strange kind. Its branches hung
   down to the ground, took root there, and threw up other trees which did
   the same, until it was encircled by a whole series of arbors. There was
   a door opening on hinges in the center of the rather large house. The
   inside of the house was about as big as a moderate-sized village
   church, and was divided into different rooms by more or less movable
   wickerwork screens which did not reach to the ceiling. The door opened
   into the first part of the house, a big anteroom running the whole
   breadth of the building and used for banquets, or, if necessary, it
   could be divided up by light movable screens to make small bedrooms
   when there were many guests. Opposite the house door was a less solid
   door in the middle of the back wall of this anteroom, leading to the
   middle part of the house through a passage with four bedrooms on each
   side of it. These rooms were partitioned off by light wickerwork
   screens of a man's height and ending at the top in open trellis-work.
   From here this passage led into the third or back part of the house,
   which was not rectangular, as it ended in a semicircular curve like the
   apse of a church. In the middle of this room, opposite the entrance,
   the wall of the fireplace rose up to the smoke-opening in the roof of
   the house; at the foot of this wall was the hearth where cooking was
   done. A five-branched lamp hung from the ceiling in front of this
   fireplace. At the side of it and behind it were several rather large
   rooms divided off by light screens. Behind the hearth, divided off by
   screens of rugs, were the rooms used by the family--the sleeping
   places, the prayer alcove, the eating and working rooms. Beyond the
   beautiful orchards round the house were fields, then a wood with a hill
   behind it.

   When the travelers arrived in the house they found everything already
   in order and in its place, for the old people had sent the things on
   ahead and had them arranged. The men-servants and maidservants had
   unpacked and settled all the things just as beautifully and neatly as
   when they were packed up, for they were so helpful and worked so
   quietly and intelligently by themselves that one did not have to be
   giving them orders all the time about every single thing as one must do
   today. Thus everything was soon settled and quiet, and the parents,
   having brought their children into their new home, blessed and embraced
   them in farewell, and set off on their journey home, accompanied by
   their little granddaughter, who went back with them. I never saw
   feasting going on during such visits and on similar occasions; they
   often lay in a circle and had a few little bowls and jugs on the carpet
   before them, but their talk was generally of divine things and holy
   expectations.

   I now saw the holy couple beginning an entirely new life here. It was
   their intention to offer to God all that was past and to behave as
   though their marriage had only then taken place, endeavoring to live in
   a manner pleasing to God, and thus to bring down upon them His blessing
   which they so earnestly desired beyond all else. I saw both of them
   going amongst their flocks and herds and following the example of their
   parents (as I have described above) in dividing them into three
   portions between the Temple, the poor, and themselves. The best and
   choicest portion was driven off to the Temple; the poor were given the
   next best one, and the least good they kept for themselves. This they
   did with all their possessions. Their house was quite spacious; they
   lived and slept in separate little rooms, where I saw them very often
   praying by themselves with great devotion. I saw them living in this
   way for a long time, giving generous alms, and each time they divided
   their herds and goods I saw that everything quickly increased again.
   They lived very abstemiously, observing periods of self-denial and
   continence. I saw them praying in penitential garments, and I often saw
   Joachim kneeling in supplication to God when he was with his herds far
   away in the pastures.

   For nineteen years after the birth of their first child they lived thus
   devoutly before God in constant yearning for the gift of fruitfulness
   and with an increasing distress. I saw ill-disposed neighbors coming to
   them and speaking ill of them, saying that they must be bad people
   since no children were born to them, that the little girl with Anna's
   parents was riot really her daughter, but had been adopted by her
   because of her barrenness, otherwise she would have had her at home,
   and so forth. Each time they heard such words, the distress of the good
   couple was renewed.

   Anna's steadfast faith was supported by an inmost certainty that the
   coming of the Messiah was near, and that she herself was among His
   human relations. She prayed for the fulfillment of the Promise with
   loud supplications, and both she and Joachim were always striving after
   more perfect purity of life. The shame of her unfruitfulness distressed
   her deeply. She could hardly appear in the synagogue without affront.
   Joachim, though short and thin, was robust, and I often saw him going
   to Jerusalem with the beasts for sacrifice. Anna was not tall either,
   and very delicately formed. Her grief so consumed her that her cheeks,
   though still slightly tinged with red, were quite hollow. They
   continued to give portions of their herds to the Temple and to the
   poor, while the portion they kept for themselves grew ever smaller and
   smaller.

  2.1 JOACHIM IS SPURNED AT THE TEMPLE AND GOES TO STAY WITH HIS FLOCKS.

   After having besought God's blessing on their marriage for so many
   years in vain, I saw that Joachim was minded to offer another sacrifice
   at the Temple. He and Anna prepared themselves for this by penitential
   devotions. I saw them lying on the hard earth in prayer during the
   night, girt in penitential garments; after which Joachim went at
   sunrise across the country to where his herds were pasturing, while
   Anna remained at home by herself. Soon after this I saw Anna sending
   him doves, other birds and many different things in cages and baskets.
   They were all taken to him by menservants to be offered up in the
   Temple. He took two donkeys from the pasture, and loaded them with
   these baskets and with others into which he put, I think, three very
   lively little white creatures with long necks. I cannot remember
   whether they were lambs or kids. He had with him a staff with a light
   on the top of it, which looked as if it were shining inside a hollow
   gourd. I saw him arriving with his menservants and beasts of burden at
   a beautiful green field between Bethany and Jerusalem, a place where
   later I often saw Jesus stay. They journeyed on to the Temple, and
   stabled the donkeys at the same Temple inn, near the cattle market,
   where Joachim and Anna afterwards lodged at Mary's Presentation. They
   then took the sacrificial offerings up the steps, and passed through
   the dwellings of the Temple servants as before. [22] Here Joachim's
   servants went back after handing over the offerings.

   Joachim himself entered the hall, where stood the basin of water in
   which all the sacrifices were washed. He then went through a long
   passage into a hall on the left of the place in which were the altar of
   incense, the table of the shewbreads and the seven-branched
   candlestick. [23] There were several others assembled there to make
   sacrifices, and it was here that Joachim had to bear his hardest trial.
   I saw that one of the priests, Reuben [24] by name, disdained his
   offerings, and did not put them with the others on the right-hand of
   the hall, where they could be seen behind the bars, but thrust them on
   one side. He reproached the unfortunate Joachim loudly and before the
   others for his unfruitfulness, refused to admit him and sent him, in
   disgrace, to an alcove enclosed with gratings.

   I saw that upon this Joachim left the Temple in the greatest distress
   and betook himself to an assembly house of the Essenes near Machaerus,
   passing Bethany on the way. Here he sought counsel and consolation. (In
   this same house, and earlier in a similar one near Bethlehem, lived the
   prophet Manahem, [25] who prophesied to the young Herod about his
   kingdom and his crimes.) From here Joachim betook himself to his most
   distant herds on Mount Hermon. His way led him across the Jordan
   through the desert of Gaddi. Mount Hermon is a long narrow mountain,
   beautifully green and rich with fruit trees on the sunny side, but
   covered with snow on the other.

  2.2 ST. ANNE RECEIVES THE PROMISE OF FERTILITY AND TRAVELS TO THE TEMPLE.

   Joachim was so grieved and ashamed at having been rejected with scorn
   at the Temple that he did not even send to tell Anna whither he had
   betaken himself. She heard, however, of the humiliation he had suffered
   from others who had witnessed it, and her distress was indescribable. I
   saw her often lying weeping with her face to the earth, because she had
   no knowledge of where Joachim was. I believe that he remained hidden
   among his flocks on Mount Hermon for as long as five months. During the
   end of that time Anna's distress was much increased by the rudeness of
   one of her maidservants, who kept reproaching her for her misfortunes.
   Once, however, when this maidservant asked to be allowed to go away for
   the Feast of Tabernacles (which was just beginning), Anna, remembering
   how her former maidservant had been led astray, refused permission out
   of vigilant care for her household. Whereupon this maidservant attacked
   her so violently, declaring that her barrenness and Joachim's desertion
   of her was God's punishment for her severity, that Anna could not bear
   to have her in her house any more. She sent her back to her parents
   with presents and accompanied by two menservants, with the request that
   they would take back their daughter who had been entrusted to her, as
   she could not keep her in her house any longer. After sending away this
   maid, Anna went sadly into her room to pray. Towards evening she threw
   a large shawl over her head, wrapping herself in it completely, and
   went with a shaded light to the great tree in the courtyard which I
   have described before as forming an arbor. Here she lit a lamp hanging
   on this tree in a sort of box, and prayed from a scroll. This tree was
   a very large one, there were arbors and seats arranged under it, for
   its branches reached over the wall to the ground, where they took root
   and shot up and again sank to the ground and took root, so that a whole
   series of arbors encircled it. This tree was like the tree in the
   Garden of Eden which bore the forbidden fruit. Its fruits hung from the
   ends of the branches generally in bunches of five. They are
   pear-shaped, and their flesh has blood-colored streaks; there is a
   hollow in the center, round which are the seeds embedded in the flesh.
   The leaves are very large, resembling, I think, those with which Adam
   and Eve covered themselves in the Garden of Eden. The Jews used these
   leaves specially for the Feast of Tabernacles. They decorated the walls
   with them, because they could be fitted together beautifully one behind
   the other like fishes' scales. Anna remained under this tree for a long
   time, crying to God and begging that even though He made her barren,
   yet He might not keep her pious companion Joachim far from her. And lo,
   there appeared to her an Angel of God, he seemed to step down before
   her from the top of the tree, and spoke to her, telling her to be of
   good heart, for the Lord had heard her prayer [26] ; she was to journey
   next day to the Temple with two maidservants, taking with her doves as
   a sacrifice. Joachim's prayer, too, he said, had been heard, and he was
   on his way to the Temple with his offerings; she would meet him under
   the Golden Gate. Joachim's sacrifice would be accepted, and they would
   be blessed and made fruitful; soon she would learn the name by which
   their child was to be called. He told her, too, that he had given a
   like message to her husband. Then he disappeared.

   Anna, full of joy, thanked God for His mercies. She then went back into
   the house and gave her maidservants the necessary orders for their
   journey to the Temple next morning. I saw her afterwards lying down to
   sleep after praying. Her bed was a narrow blanket with a pillow under
   her head. (In the morning her blanket was rolled up.) She took off her
   upper garments, wrapped herself from head to foot in an ample covering,
   and lay down at full length on her right side, with her face to the
   wall against which was the bed. After she had slept for a short time, I
   saw a brightness pouring down towards her from above, which on
   approaching her bed was transformed into the figure of a shining youth.
   It was the angel of the Lord, who told her that she would conceive a
   holy child; stretching his hand over her, he wrote great shining
   letters on the wall which formed the name MARY. Thereupon the angel
   dissolved into light and disappeared.

   During this time Anna seemed to be wrapped in a secret, joyful dream.
   She rose half-waking from her couch, prayed with great intensity, and
   then fell asleep again without having completely recovered
   consciousness. After midnight she awoke joyfully, as if by an inner
   inspiration, and now she saw, with alarm mixed with joy, the writing on
   the wall. This seemed to be of shining golden-red letters, large and
   few in number; she gazed at them with unspeakable joy and contrite
   humility until day came, when they faded away. She saw the writing so
   clearly, and her joy thereat became so great, that when she got up she
   appeared quite young again. In the moment when the light of the angel
   had enveloped Anna in grace, I saw a radiance under her heart and
   recognized in her the chosen Mother, the illuminated vessel of the
   grace that was at hand. What I saw in her I can only describe by saying
   that I recognized in her the cradle and tabernacle of the holy child
   she was to conceive and preserve; a mother blessed indeed. I saw that
   by God's grace Anna was able to bear fruit. I cannot describe the
   wonderful manner in which I recognized this. I saw Anna as the cradle
   of all mankind's salvation, and, at the same time, as a sacred
   altar-vessel, opened, yet hidden behind a curtain. I recognized this
   after a natural manner, and all this knowledge of mine was one and was
   natural and sacred at the same time. (Anna was at that time, I think,
   forty-three years old.)

   She now got up, lit the lamp, prayed, and then started on her journey
   to Jerusalem with her offerings. All the members of her household were
   full of strange joyfulness that morning, though none but Anna knew of
   the coming of the angel.

  2.3 JOACHIM IS COMFORTED BY AN ANGEL AND RETURNS AGAIN TO THE TEMPLE TO
  SACRIFICE.

   At the same time I saw Joachim among his flocks on Mount Hermon beyond
   the Jordan constantly praying God to grant his supplications. As he
   watched the young lambs bleating and frolicking round their mothers, he
   felt sorely distressed at having no children, but did not tell his
   shepherds why he was so sad. It was near the time of the Feast of
   Tabernacles, and he and his shepherds were beginning to put up the
   tabernacles. Remembering his humiliation at the Temple, he had
   abandoned the idea of going tip as usual to Jerusalem for the feast and
   offering sacrifices, but as he was praying I saw an angel appear to
   him, telling him to be of good courage and to journey to the Temple,
   for his sacrifice would be accepted and his prayers granted. He would
   meet his wife under the Golden Gate. Thereupon I saw Joachim joyfully
   dividing his flocks and herds once more into three portions--and what
   numbers of fine beasts he had! The least good he kept for himself, the
   next best he sent to the Essenes, and the best of all he drove to the
   Temple with his herdsmen. He arrived in Jerusalem on the fourth day of
   the feast, and stayed in his usual lodgings near the Temple.

   Anna arrived in Jerusalem also on the fourth day of the feast and
   stayed with Zechariah's relations by the fish market. She did not meet
   Joachim until the end of the feast.

   Although on the previous occasion it was by a sign from above that
   Joachim's offerings were rejected, I saw that the priest who had
   treated him so harshly instead of comforting and consoling him was in
   some way (I cannot remember how) punished by God. Now, however, the
   priests had received a divine warning to accept his offerings, and I
   saw that some of them, on being told of his approach with the
   sacrificial beasts, went out of the Temple to meet him and accepted his
   gifts. The cattle which he had brought as a gift to the Temple were not
   his actual offering. The sacrifice he brought to be slaughtered
   consisted of two lambs and three lively little animals, kids, I think.
   I saw, too, that many of his acquaintances congratulated him on his
   sacrifice being accepted. I saw that because of the feast the whole
   Temple was open and decorated with garlands of fruit and greenery, and
   that in one place a Tabernacle had been set up on eight detached
   pillars. Joachim went from place to place in the Temple exactly as he
   did before. His sacrifice was slaughtered and burnt at the usual place.
   Some part of it was, however, burnt at another place, to the right, I
   think, of the entrance hall with the great teaching pulpit. [27] I saw
   the priests making a sacrifice of incense in the Holy Place. Lamps,
   too, were lighted and lights burned on the seven-branched candlestick,
   but not on all seven branches at once. I often saw that on different
   occasions different branches of it were lighted. As the smoke arose
   from the offering, I saw as it were a beam of light falling upon the
   officiating priest in the Holy Place and at the same time on Joachim
   without in the hall. There came a sudden pause in what was going on, it
   seemed from astonishment and the realization of something supernatural.
   Thereupon I saw that two priests went out into the hall to Joachim as
   though by God's command, and led him through the side rooms up to the
   golden altar of incense in the Holy Place. The priest then laid
   something on the altar. This was not, I could see, separate grains of
   incense; it looked like a solid lump, but I cannot remember what it
   was. [28] This lump gave out a powerful and sweet smell of incense as
   it was burnt upon the altar of incense before the veil of the Holy of
   Holies. Then I saw the priest going away, leaving Joachim alone in the
   Holy Place. While the incense-offering was being consumed I saw Joachim
   in a state of ecstasy, kneeling with outstretched arms. I saw
   approaching him a shining figure of an angel, such as later appeared to
   Zechariah when he received the promise of the Baptist's birth. The
   angel spoke to Joachim, and gave him a scroll on which I recognized,
   written in shining letters, the three names Helia, Hanna, Miriam. [29]
   Beside the last of these names I saw the picture of a little Ark of the
   Covenant or tabernacle. Joachim fastened this scroll to his breast
   under his garment. The angel told him that his unfruitfulness was no
   disgrace for him, but on the contrary, an honor, for the child his wife
   was to conceive was to be the immaculate fruit of God's blessing upon
   him and the crowning point of the blessing of Abraham. Joachim, being
   unable to grasp this, was led by the angel behind the veil hanging in
   front of the Holy of Holies. Between this veil and the bars of the
   screen before the Holy of Holies was a space large enough to stand in.
   I saw the angel approach the Ark of the Covenant, and it seemed to me
   as if he took something out of it, for I saw him hold towards Joachim a
   shining globe or circle of light, bidding him breathe upon it and look
   into it. (When he held the circle of light so near his face, it made me
   think of a custom at our country weddings where the sacristan gives one
   a little board to kiss with a head painted on it, and makes one pay
   three halfpence for doing so.) Then I saw as if all kinds of pictures
   appeared in the circle of light when Joachim breathed on it and that
   these were visible to him. His breath had in no way dimmed the circle
   of light, and the angel told him that the conception of Anna's child
   would be as untarnished as this globe, which had remained shining in
   spite of his having breathed on it. Thereupon I saw as if the angel
   lifted the globe until it stood like an encircling halo in the air, in
   which I saw, as through an opening in it, a series of pictures starting
   with the Fall and ending with the Redemption of mankind. The whole
   course of the world passed before my eyes as one picture merged into
   another. I knew and understood it all, but I cannot reproduce the
   details. Above, at the very summit, I saw the Blessed Trinity, and
   below and on one side of the Trinity, I saw the Garden of Eden, with
   Adam and Eve, the Fall, the promise of Redemption and all its
   prototypes--Noah, the Flood, the Ark, the receiving of the blessing
   through Abraham, its handing on to his firstborn Isaac, from Isaac to
   Jacob, how it was taken from Jacob by the angel with whom he struggled,
   how the blessing came to Joseph in Egypt and increased in glory in him
   and in his wife. I saw how the sacred presence of the blessing was
   removed by Moses from Egypt with relics of Joseph and his wife Asenath,
   and became the Holy of Holies of the Ark of the Covenant, the presence
   of the living God among His people. Then I saw the reverence paid by
   God's people to this sacred thing and their ceremonies respecting it; I
   saw the relationships and marriages which formed the sacred genealogy
   of the Blessed Virgin's ancestry, as well as all the prototypes and
   symbols of her and of Our Savior in history and in the prophets. All
   this I saw in encircling symbols and also rising from the lower part of
   the ring of light. I saw pictures of great cities, towers, palaces,
   thrones, gates, gardens, and flowers, all strangely woven together as
   it were by bridges of light; and all were being attacked and assaulted
   by fierce beasts and other figures of might. These pictures all
   signified how Our Blessed Lady's ancestral family, from which God was
   to take Flesh and be made Man, had been led, like all that is holy, by
   God's grace through many assaults and struggles. I remember, too,
   having seen at a certain point in this series of pictures a garden
   surrounded by a thick hedge of thorns, which a host of serpents and
   other loathsome creatures attempted in vain to penetrate. I also saw a
   strong tower assaulted on all sides by men-at-arms, who were falling
   down from it. I saw many pictures of this kind, relating to the history
   of the ancestry of the Blessed Virgin; and the bridges and passages
   which joined all together signified the victory over all attempts to
   disturb, hinder, or interrupt the work of salvation. It was as if by
   God's compassion there had been poured into mankind, as into a muddy
   stream, a pure flesh and a pure blood, and as if this had, with great
   toil and difficulty, to reconstitute itself out of its scattered
   elements, the whole stream striving the while to draw it into its
   troubled waters; and then, as if by the countless mercies of God and
   the faithful cooperation of mankind, it had at last issued forth, after
   many pollutions and many cleansings, in an unfailing stream out of
   which rose the Blessed Virgin, from whom the Word was made Flesh and
   dwelt among us.

   Among the pictures that I saw in the globe of light there were many
   which occur in the litany of the Blessed Virgin. Whenever I say that
   litany, I see them and recognize them and venerate them with great
   devotion. The pictures in the globe unfolded themselves still further
   till they reached the fulfillment of all God's compassion towards
   mankind, so divided and dispersed in its fallen state, and ended, on
   the side opposite the Garden of Eden, with the heavenly Jerusalem at
   the foot of the Throne of God. After I had seen all these pictures, the
   globe (which was really a series of pictures passing in and out of a
   circle of light) disappeared. I think that all this was a communication
   to Joachim of a vision revealed to him by the angel and also seen by
   me. Whenever I receive such a communication, it appears in a circle of
   light like a globe.

  2.4 JOACHIM RECEIVES THE BLESSING FROM THE ARK OF THE COVENANT.

   I saw now that the angel touched or anointed Joachim's forehead with
   the tip of his thumb and forefinger, and that he gave him a shining
   morsel to eat and a luminous liquid to drink from a gleaming little
   chalice which he held between two fingers. It was of the shape of the
   chalice at the Last Supper, but without a foot. It seemed to me, too,
   that this food which he put in his mouth took the form of a little
   shining ear of corn and a little shining cluster of grapes, and I
   understood that thereafter every impurity and every sinful desire left
   Joachim. Thereupon I saw that the angel imparted to Joachim the highest
   and holiest fruit of the blessing given by God to Abraham, and
   culminating, through Joseph, in the holy thing within the Ark of the
   Covenant, in the presence of God among His people. He gave Joachim this
   blessing in the same form as I had been shown before, except that while
   the angel of benediction gave Abraham the blessing from himself, out of
   his bosom as it were, he seemed to give it to Joachim from out of the
   Holy of Holies. [30]

   The blessing of Abraham was as it were the beginning of God's grace
   given in blessing to the father of His future people so that from him
   might proceed the stones for the building of His Temple. But when
   Joachim received the blessing, it was as though the angel were taking
   the holy benediction from the tabernacle of this Temple and delivering
   it to a priest, in order that from him might be formed the holy vessel
   in which the Word was to be made Flesh. All this cannot be expressed in
   words, for I speak of that Holy of Holies inviolate, yet violated in
   man when he sinned and fell. From my earliest youth I have very often,
   in my visions from the Old Testament, seen into the Ark of the
   Covenant, and have always had the impression of a complete church, but
   more solemn and awe-inspiring. I saw therein not only the Tables of the
   Law as the written Word of God, but also a sacramental presence of the
   Living God, [31] like the roots of the wine and wheat and of the flesh
   and blood of the future sacrifice of our redemption.

   The grace given by this blessed presence produced, with the cooperation
   of God-fearing men under the Law, that holy tree whose final blossoming
   was the pure flower in which the Word became flesh and God became Man;
   thus, giving us, in the New Covenant, His humanity and His divinity by
   instituting the Sacrament of His Body and Blood, without which we
   cannot attain eternal life. I have never known the Ark of the Covenant
   without the sacramental presence of God except when it had fallen into
   the hands of the enemy, at which times the holy presence was safe in
   the hands of the high priest or of one of the prophets. When only the
   Tables of the Law were present in the Ark of the Covenant, without the
   holy treasure, it seemed to me like the Temple of the Samaritans on
   Mount Garizim, or like a church of our own time which is without the
   Blessed Sacrament and, instead of the Tables of the Law written by
   God's hand, contains only the books of Holy Scripture imperfectly
   understood by mankind.

   In the Ark of the Covenant made by Moses, which stood in the Temple and
   Tabernacle of Solomon, I saw this most Holy Thing of the Old Covenant
   in the form of a shining circle crossed by two smaller rays of light
   intersecting each other; but now, when the angel imparted the blessing
   to Joachim, I saw this blessing being given to him in the form of
   something shining, like a shining seed or bean in shape, which he laid
   in the open breast of Joachim's garment. When the blessing was imparted
   to Abraham, I saw grace being conveyed to him in the same manner, and
   its virtue and efficacy remaining with him in the degree ordained by
   God until he handed it over to his firstborn son Isaac, from whom it
   passed to Jacob and from him, through the angel, to Joseph, and from
   Joseph and his wife, with increased virtue, to the Ark of the Covenant.
   I perceived that the angel bound Joachim to secrecy, and I understood
   why it was that later Zechariah, the Baptist's father, had become dumb
   after he had received the blessing and the promise of Elizabeth's
   fruitfulness from the Angel Gabriel at the Altar of Incense. [ St. Luke
   1.9-22.] It was revealed to me, that with this blessing Joachim
   received the highest fruit and the true fulfillment of Abraham's
   blessing, namely the blessing for the immaculate conception of the most
   Holy Virgin who was to bruise the head of the serpent. The angel then
   led Joachim back into the Holy Place and disappeared, upon which
   Joachim sank to the ground in an ecstasy as though paralyzed. The
   priests who re-entered the Holy Place found him radiant with joy. They
   lifted him up reverently, and placed him outside in a seat generally
   used only by priests. Here they washed his face, held some
   strong-smelling substance to his nostrils, gave him to drink and in
   general treated him as one does someone who has fainted. When he had
   recovered, he looked young and strong, and was beaming with joy.

   on the morning of June 27th, 1819. (Tr.)

   [2] It is commonly stated that such separation was required of priests

   [5] Communicated in July and August 1821. (Tr.)

   [6] This was taken down in August 1821 by the writer from Catherine
   Emmerich's words. In July 1840, when preparing the book for printing,
   he asked a language expert for an explanation of the word Azkara, and
   was told that Azkarah meant commemoration and is the name of the
   portion of the unbloody sacrifice, which was burnt on the altar by the
   priest to the glory of God and to remind Him of His merciful promises.
   The unbloody sacrifices generally consisted of the finest wheaten flour
   mixed with oil and sprinkled with incense. The priest burnt as the
   Azkarah all the incense and also a handful of flour and oil (baked or
   unbaked). In the case of the shewbread the incense alone was the
   Azkarah ( Lev. 24.7). The Vulgate translates the word Azkarah
   alternatively as memoriale', in memoriam', or in monumentum'. (CB) Lev.
   24.7, literally: "And you shall place upon the shewbread pure incense,
   and it shall be for the bread as a memorial (azkarah), a burnt offering
   to the Lord." The other references to the word azkarah are in Lev. 2.2,
   9, 16; 5.12; 6.8; Num. 5.26 in connection with the burning of a meal
   offering (minhah). The connection with the Essenes remains obscure.
   (SB)

   [7] Hasid (pl. Hasidim), originally meaning merciful' (of God), came to
   mean devout' of men, and was later in Maccabean times used to designate
   a specific group of devout and observant Jews who joined the Maccabean
   party in their fight for freedom ( I Macc.2.42). These Hasideans (Gk.
   Asidaioi), as they were then called, are generally believed to be the
   forerunners of the Pharisees (cf. Lagrange, Le Judaisme avant
   Jesus-Christ, 1931, pp. 56, 272), and probably of the Essenes
   (Bonsirven, Le Judaisme Palestinien, 1935, I, pp. 43, 64), both sects
   being mentioned by Josephus in Maccabean times ( Ant., XIII, v, 9) .
   (SB)

   [8] They were called Essenoi by Josephus, Esseni by Pliny, and Essaioi
   by Philo (and six times by Josephus). The origin of the name is
   uncertain (cf. Lagrange, op. cit. , p. 320). Their way of life, as
   described by AC, is for the most part fully attested by the
   contemporary historian Josephus ( BJ , II, viii. 2-13), as well as by
   Philo (Quod omnis probus liber sit , 75-88). Pliny's remarks ( Hist.
   Nat. , V, 17) attribute to the Essenes an antiquity of thousands of
   years'. There is no other evidence of an antiquity beyond Maccabean
   times. (Most texts in Lagrange, op. cit. , pp. 307-17.) Passing
   references by Josephus are in Ant., XIII, v, 9 and XVIII, i, 5. (SB)

   [9] The spiritual head on Mount Horeb, Archos, it not mentioned in any
   of the documents. (SB)

   [10] It is well known that the Essenes refused to sacrifice animals,
   but the ritual of releasing them (as described by AC) is one of the few
   matters that is not documented. In Lev. 14.53 the Law prescribed the
   freeing of a bird after purification from leprosy, and in 16.22 the
   ritual of the scapegoat, which was to carry away all their iniquities
   into at uninhabited land.' (SB)

   [11] The little daughter of Catherine Emmerich's brother, who came from
   the farm of Flamske near Coesfeld to visit her at Dülmen in the winter
   of 1820, was seized with violent convulsions occurring every evening at
   the same time and beginning with distressing choking. These convulsions
   often lasted until midnight, and Catherine Emmerich, knowing as she did
   the cause and significance of this and indeed of most other illnesses,
   was greatly affected by her niece's sufferings. She prayed many times
   to be told of a cure for them, and at last was able to describe a
   certain little flower known to her which she had seen St. Luke pick and
   use to cure epilepsy. As a result of her minute description of the
   little flower and of the places where it grew, her physician, Dr.
   Wesener (the district doctor of Dülmen), found it; she recognized the
   plant which he brought her as the one she had seen, which she called
   star-flower ', and he identified it as Cerastium arvense linnaei or
   Holosteum caryophylleum veterum (Field Mouse-ear Chickweed). It is
   remarkable that the old herbal Tabernamontani also refers to the use of
   this plant for epilepsy. On the afternoon of May 22nd, 1821, Catherine
   Emmerich said in her sleep: Rue [which she had used before] and
   star-flower sprinkled with holy water should be pressed, and the juice
   given to the child, surely that could do no harm? I have already been
   told three times to squeeze it myself and give it to her.' The writer,
   in the hope that she might communicate something more definite about
   this cure, had, unknown to her, wrapped up at home some blossoms of
   this plant in paper like a relic and pinned the little packet to her
   dress in the evening. She woke up and said at once: That is not a
   relic, it is the star-flower.' She kept the little flower pinned to her
   dress during the night, and on the morning of May 23rd, 1821, she said:
   I had no idea why I was lying last night in a field amongst nothing but
   star-flowers. I saw, too, all kinds of ways in which these flowers were
   used, and it was said to me, "If men knew the healing power of this
   plant, it would not grow so plentifully around you." I saw pictures of
   it being used in very distant ages. I saw St. Luke wandering about
   picking these flowers. I saw, too, in a place like the one where Christ
   fed the 5,000, many sick folk lying on these flowers in the open air,
   protected by a light shelter above them. These plants were spread out
   like litter for them to lie on; and arranged with the flowers in the
   center under their bodies, and the stalks and leaves pointing outwards.
   They were suffering from gout, convulsions, and swellings, and had
   under them round cushions filled with the flowers. I saw their swollen
   feet being wrapped round with these flowers, and I saw the sick people
   eating the flowers and drinking water which had been poured on them.
   The flowers were larger than those here. It was a picture of a long
   time ago; the people and the doctors wore long white woolen robes with
   girdles. I saw that the plants were always blessed before use. I saw
   also a plant of the same family but more succulent and with rounder,
   juicier, smoother leaves and pale blue blossoms of the same shape,
   which is very efficacious in children's convulsions. It grows in better
   soil and is not so common. I think it is called eyebright. I found it
   once near Dernekamp. It is stronger than the other.' She then gave the
   child three flowers to begin with; the second time she was to have
   five. She said: I see the child's nature, but cannot rightly describe
   it; inside she is like a torn garment, which needs a new piece of stuff
   for each tear.' (CB)

   [12] These were Catherine Emmerich's words on August 16th, 1821. The
   names are here written down as the writer heard them pronounced by her
   lips, and also her explanation noble mother'. When the writer read this
   passage to a language expert in 1840, the latter said that it was
   indeed true that Em romo means a noble mother. (CB) Em ramah could mean
   noble mother', though the adjective ram , usually meaning materially
   high' or else proud', has no obvious parallel in a proper name, except
   perhaps in Amram (the father of Moses), which may mean noble uncle'.
   (SB)

   [13] She unquestionably meant that these herbs were the same as those
   mentioned by Eusebius in his ecclesiastical history, Book VII, Chapter
   18, which he says grew round the statue of Jesus Christ put up by the
   woman of Caesarea Philippi, who was cured of the issue of blood. The
   plants acquired the power of healing all kinds of sicknesses as soon as
   they had grown high enough to touch the hem of the statue's garment.
   Eusebius says that this plant is of an unknown species. Catherine
   Emmerich had spoken before of the statue and of these plants. (CB)

   [14] In July 1840, some twenty years after this communication, as this
   book was being prepared for the press, the writer learnt from a
   language expert that the cabalistic book Zohar contains several
   references to this matter. (CB) The Zohar is a rabbinic book, claiming
   descent from Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai (second century), in the form of a
   commentary on the Pentateuch, interpreting it throughout, in an
   enigmatic and esoteric style, according to a mystical sense. The Zohar
   first became known through the 13 ^th-century Rabbi Moses de Leon, who
   has often been accused of fabricating the whole thing. Present-day
   opinion, however, suspends judgment, while emphasizing that the Zohar
   shows evidence of being a compilation of texts and fragments whose
   composition probably extended over many centuries, and which is likely
   to enshrine teaching of the greatest antiquity. The Zohar is one of the
   principal sources of spiritual interpretation among the Jews, and its
   main theme may be said to be the significance of every detail in sacred
   history, and the symbolic reflection in this world of the eternal
   realities of heaven. With regard to its connection with the statements
   of AC, see further n. 34, p. 26 . (SB)

   [15] Catherine Emmerich pronounced these and all other name-sounds with
   her Low-German accent and often hesitatingly. Her pronunciation, she
   said, only resembled the real names, and it is impossible to be sure
   how correctly or incorrectly they have been written down. It is all the
   more astonishing to find elsewhere long afterwards similar names for
   the same persons. The following is an instance. Several years after
   Catherine Emmerich's death the writer found in the Encomium trium
   Mariarum Bertaudi, Petragorici, Paris, 1529, and in particular in the
   treatise De cognatione divi Joannis Baptistae cum filiabus et nepotibus
   beatae Annae, lib. III, f. lii, etc., attached to it, that St. Cyril,
   the third General of the Carmelite Order, who died in 1224, mentions in
   a work concerning the ancestors of St. Anne similar visions of
   branches, buds, and flowers seen by the prophet of whom counsel was
   sought. He further states that Stolanus was also called Agarim or
   Garizi, names which reproduce sounds recognizable in the
   above-mentioned Garescha or Sarziri. On the other hand, in this account
   it is a Carmelite on Mount Carmel instead of an Essene on Mount Horeb
   of whom counsel is sought. Seventeen years after the death of Catherine
   Emmerich the writer was reading, on the feast of Corpus Christi, 1840,
   the life of Our Lady's holy mother in the Actis Sanctorum, Tom. VI,
   Julii, where Joannes Eckius in his homily on St. Anne says that
   Stolanus is called by tradition Stolan, and that the Roman Breviary of
   1536 and several Breviaries printed before the reign of Pius V mention
   a daughter Gaziri, while others call her Garzim. A philological friend
   who was kind enough to read my proofs, observed: It is surprising that
   the names Gaziri, Garzi (the final m has been added), Garsha or
   Garescha (all three forms are correct, though formed from different
   verbs) all agree in meaning "outcast", and that Agari(m) in Arabic also
   conveys the idea of flight and banishment. Stolanus in Greek contains
   the idea of wandering. Sarssir means starling and thus also signifies a
   wandering bird.' (CB) The Hebrew root g-r-sh and the corresponding
   Arabic root g-sh-r convey the idea of banishment. The Hebrew ger (and
   its Arabic equivalent) means a stranger'. The Greek stolos means a
   journey' (cf . apostolos ). Zurzur is the Arabic for a starling', being
   derived apparently from the bird's noise. (SB)

   [16] It is certainly true that the writers who follow tradition
   generally give Emerentia as the mother of St. Anne; but they give the
   wife of Stolanus as Emerentia, whereas Catherine Emmerich calls her
   Emorun. According to tradition, Emerentia, the wife of Stolanus, bore
   Ismeria, the mother of Elizabeth, and Anna, the mother of the Blessed
   Virgin. Yet according to Catherine Emmerich's account, Anna is the
   granddaughter, not the daughter, of Stolanus. If this is a mistake of
   hers, the reason for it may be that the humble visionary has confused
   her own visions with the account which she had heard from her childhood
   of the traditional descent of St. Anne. The name Emerentia is perhaps
   nothing more than the Latinized form of the name (heard by her) of
   Emorun. But being either ignorant or forgetful of this, and having
   always heard of the names Emerentia and Ismeria as being traditionally
   in close association with Stolanus as the nearest relations of Anna
   before her marriage, she may have described them as daughters of
   Stolanus. At the same time it was very noticeable that she never
   confused any of the countless names which came to her ears except in
   extreme illness and distress. We are, however, inclined to suppose that
   there must be some error here, for tradition in general mentions St.
   Elizabeth as being a niece of St. Anne's, whereas according to
   Catherine Emmerich's account Elizabeth is the niece of Anna's mother,
   which would seem to make Elizabeth almost older than Anna, who is
   called a late-born child. Since the writer cannot explain the error
   which may possibly have crept in, he begs the kind reader to accept it
   with patience and thus make amends for the writer's lack of that
   Christian virtue in his difficult and often interrupted task of
   compiling an account of these visions. (CB)

   [17] The Apocryphal Gospels tell us nothing about the ancestors of Our
   Lady, except the names of Joachim and Anne, which are also attested by
   the liturgy and the calendar. Nat . Mar. I further states that Joachim
   was from Nazareth and Anne from Bethlehem, and Ps-Matt. I that Anne's
   father was called Achar. Apart from these, AC's statements are all
   independent. (SB)

   [18] Most of AC's geographical references are to features traceable on
   the map, even though some, such as the Valley of Zabulon here, are not
   specifically mentioned in the Bible. (SB)

   [19] Matthat, son of Levi, is named in Luke's genealogy (3.23), and see
   further n. 41, p. 18 . (SB)

   [20] Cf. infra , n. 29, p. 22 , and n. 41, p. 32 .

   [21] The Apocryphal Gospels (Protev. 2, Ps-Matt. I , Nat. Mar. I)
   represent Anna as childless until the conception of Mary. Protev. 2
   also relates an incident (though of a different nature) with a
   handmaid. (SB)

   [22] The reader must not be disconcerted by Catherine Emmerich's
   references (here and subsequently) to events which may not yet have
   been mentioned in her account. It must be remembered that the visions
   from the story of the Blessed Virgin, here given in chronological
   order, were vouchsafed to Catherine Emmerich year by year on the
   various church festivals with which these visions were connected; so
   that now when relating in July and August 1821, at the time of the
   feasts of St. Anne and St. Joachim, her visions of the life of Our
   Lady's parents, she is referring (in order to make herself more
   comprehensible) to something which she had already seen in previous
   years in November on the occasion of the feast of Our Lady's
   Presentation at the Temple. (CB)

   [23] Cf. 3 Kings 7.48, 49. (SB)

   [24] The priest Reuben appears in Protev. I , Ps-Matt. 2, and in Nat.
   Mar. 2 is named Issachar. (SB)

   [25] This Manahem appears in no document. (SB)

   [26] The story of Anna's consolation by the angel, and the appointment
   of a rendezvous at the Golden Gate is found in Protev. 4, Ps-Mat. 3,
   Nat. Mar. 3. (SB)

   [27] This statement is confirmed by the following: According to Jewish
   tradition a portion of the burnt offering had to be burnt, not on the
   altar, but near it and to the east, on the so-called ash-heap. This
   portion was the sinew of the thigh, which in Jacob's wrestling with the
   Angel withered up on being touched by the latter (forthwith it shrank',
   Gen. 32.25). See also Gen. 32.32. (CB) Gen. 32.32 states that the
   Israelites eat not of the sinew which shrank', but there is no
   available subsequent legislation about this matter. (SB)

   [28] It was doubtless a mixture, melted together, of the ingredients
   required by Jewish tradition for the daily incense-offering, namely
   myrrh, cassia, spikenard, saffron, sweet-scented reed, cinnamon,
   costus, sea-lavender, thrift, galbanum, and incense, mixed with pure
   salt. (CB) Exod. 30.34-38 prescribed four elements in the preparation
   of incense. Later rabbinic tradition increased these (as CB notes), and
   by the time of Christ thirteen elements were used, as Josephus relates
   (BJ, V, v, 5). (SB)

   [29] The writer was at the time unaware that these three names were
   only other forms of Joachim, Anna, and Mary. His later discovery of
   this proof of the accuracy of Catherine Emmerich's version of the names
   was a striking testimony to the authenticity of her visions. (CB) See
   infra, n. 41, p. 32 , on the identification of Joachim and Heli. The
   name Joachim (Yehoyaqim) means The Lord shall make to stand (or rise)'
   (e.g. IV Kings 23.34). The name Helia (presumably Heli-yah) would mean
   My strength is the Lord', but does not occur in the Bible. It is,
   however, maintained in Cath. Enc., art. Virgin Mary', p. 464, E d, that
   Elia (Helia) is but an abbreviation of the name Eliacim (Elyaqim),
   which, using the other divine name, means God shall make to stand (or
   rise)', and, indeed, in IV Kings 23.34 the name of King Eliacim was
   changed by Pharaoh to Joakim (Yoyaqim). (SB)

   [30] Catherine Emmerich, who in communicating her many and various
   visions from the Old Testament often spoke in great detail of the Ark
   of the Covenant, never said that after the Babylonian captivity the
   first Ark of the Covenant with all its contents was placed in the
   rebuilt Temple or later in the Temple restored by Herod. She did,
   however, state that there was a restored Ark in the Holy of Holies of
   the Temple, I in which were still preserved a few remains of the sacred
   contents of the first Ark of the Covenant, some of which she saw in the
   possession of the Essenes and venerated by them. (CB) Josephus (BJ, V,
   v, 5) plainly states that there was nothing at all' I in the Holy of
   Holies in Herod's Temple. (SB)

   [31] The reader need not be scandalized by the expression sacramental
   presence of God', for Holy Writ clearly declares that God was present
   above the Ark of the Covenant in a mysterious and visible manner. (CB)

                         II. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION

1. JOACHIM AND ST. ANNE MEET BENEATH THE GOLDEN GATE.

   It was a warning from on high that had led Joachim into the Holy Place,
   and it was by a similar inspiration that he was brought into a
   subterranean passage which belonged to the consecrated part of the
   Temple and ran under it and under the Golden Gate. I have been told
   what was the meaning and origin of this passage when the Temple was
   built, and also what it was used for, but I have no clear recollection
   of this. Some religious observance relating to the blessing and
   reconciliation of the unfruitful was, I think, connected with this
   passage. In certain circumstances people were brought into it for rites
   of purification, expiation, absolution, and the like. [32] Joachim was
   led by priests near the slaughtering-place through a little door into
   this passage. The priests turned back, but Joachim continued along the
   passage, which gradually sloped downwards. Anna had also come to the
   Temple with her maidservant, who was carrying the doves for sacrifice
   in wicker baskets. She had handed over her offering and had revealed to
   a priest that she had been bidden by an angel to meet her husband under
   the Golden Gate. I now saw that she was led by priests, accompanied by
   some venerable women (among whom I think was the prophetess Anna),
   through an entrance on the other side into the consecrated passage,
   where her companions left her. I had a very wonderful view of what this
   passage was like. Joachim went through a little door; the passage
   sloped downwards, and was at first narrow but became broader
   afterwards. The walls were of glistening gold and green, and a reddish
   light shone in from above. I saw beautiful pillars like twisted trees
   and vines. After passing through about a third of the passage Joachim
   came to a place in the midst of which stood a pillar in the form of a
   palm tree with hanging leaves and fruits. Here he was met by Anna,
   radiant with happiness. They embraced each other with holy joy, and
   each told the other their good tidings. They were in a state of ecstasy
   and enveloped in a cloud of light. I saw this light issuing from a
   great host of angels, who were carrying the appearance of a high
   shining tower and hovering above the heads of Anna and Joachim. The
   form of this tower was the same as I see in pictures, from the litany
   of the Blessed Virgin, of the Tower of David, the Tower of Ivory, and
   so forth. I saw that this tower seemed to disappear between Anna and
   Joachim, who were enveloped in a glory of brightness. I understood
   that, as a result of the grace here given, the conception of Mary was
   as pure as all conceptions would have been but for the Fall. I had at
   the same time an indescribable vision. The heavens opened above them,
   and I saw the joy of the Holy Trinity and of the angels, and their
   participation in the mysterious blessing here bestowed on Mary's
   parents. Anna and Joachim returned, praising God, to the exit under the
   Golden Gate: towards the end the passage sloped upwards. They came into
   a kind of chapel under a beautiful and high arch, where many lights
   were burning. Here they were received by priests who led them away. The
   part of the Temple above which was the hall of the Sanhedrin lay over
   the middle of the subterranean passage; above this end of it were, I
   think, dwellings of priests whose duty it was to look after the
   vestments. Joachim and Anna now came to a kind of bay at the outermost
   edge of the Temple hill, overlooking the valley of Josaphat, where the
   path could no longer go straight on but branched to right and left.
   After they had visited another priest's house, I saw Joachim and Anna
   and their servants starting on their journey home. On their arrival at
   Nazareth, Joachim, after a joyful meal, gave food to many poor people
   and distributed generous alms. I saw how full he and Anna were of joy
   and fervor and gratitude to God when they thought of His compassion
   towards them; I often saw them praying together with tears.

   It was explained to me here that the Blessed Virgin was begotten by her
   parents in holy obedience and complete purity of heart, and that
   thereafter they lived together in continence in the greatest devoutness
   and fear of God. I was at the same time clearly instructed how
   immeasurably the holiness of children was encouraged by the purity,
   chastity, and continence of their parents and by their resistance to
   all unclean temptations; and how continence after conception preserves
   the fruit of the womb from many sinful impulses. In general, I was
   given an overflowing abundance of knowledge about the roots of
   deformity and sin.

2. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONCEPTION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

   [Here follow various visions which Catherine Emmerich communicated at
   different times in the course of her yearly meditations during the
   octave of the feast of the Immaculate Conception. Though they do not
   directly continue the story of the Blessed Virgin's life, yet they
   throw a remarkable light on the mystery of her election, preparation,
   and veneration as the vessel of grace. As these visions were related by
   Catherine Emmerich in the midst of much suffering and many
   interruptions, it is not surprising if they are somewhat fragmentary in
   character.]

  2.1 THE ANGELS ARE SHOWN THE RESTORATION OF MANKIND.

   I saw in a wonderful picture that God showed the angels how it was His
   will to restore mankind after the Fall. At first sight I did not
   understand this picture, but soon it became quite clear to me. I saw
   the Throne of God and the Holy Trinity, and at the same time a movement
   within that Trinity. I saw the nine choirs of angels, and how God
   announced to them in what manner it was His will to restore the fallen
   human race. I saw an inexpressible joy among the angels over this. I
   was now shown in a number of symbolic pictures the unfolding of God's
   designs for the salvation of mankind. I saw these pictures appearing
   among the nine choirs of angels and following each other in a kind of
   historical sequence. I saw the angels helping to make these pictures,
   protecting and defending them. I cannot now remember for certain the
   order in which they appeared, but will tell in God's name what I can
   still recollect. I saw a mountain as of precious stones appear before
   the Throne of God; it grew and spread. It was in terraces, like a
   throne; then it changed into the shape of a tower--a tower which
   enshrined every treasure of the spirit and every gift of grace and was
   surrounded by the nine choirs of angels. At one side of this tower vine
   tendrils and ears of corn, intertwined like the fingers of folded
   hands, seemed to be streaming down from the edge of a golden cloud. I
   cannot remember at what exact moment in the whole picture I saw this. I
   saw in the sky a figure like a virgin which passed into the tower and
   as it were melted into it. The tower was very broad and was flat at the
   top; it seemed to have an opening at the back through which the virgin
   passed into it. This was not the Blessed Virgin as she is in time, but
   as she is in eternity, in God. I saw the appearance of her being formed
   before the face of the Holy Trinity, just as when one breathes, a
   little cloud is formed before one's mouth. [33] I also saw something
   going forth from the Holy Trinity towards the tower. At this moment of
   the picture I saw a vessel like a ciborium being formed among the
   choirs of angels. The angels all joined in giving this vessel the form
   of a tower surrounded by many pictures full of significance. Beside it
   stood two figures joining hands behind it. This spiritual vessel went
   on increasing in size, beauty, and richness. Then I saw something
   proceed from God and pass through all nine choirs of angels; it seemed
   to me like a little shining holy cloud which became more and more
   distinct as it approached the sacramental vessel which it finally
   entered. But in order that I should recognize this to be a real and
   essential blessing of God, conferring the grace of a pure and sinless
   line from generation to generation (like the cultivation of some plant
   in all its purity), I finally saw this blessing in the shape of a
   shining bean, enter the ciborium, which then passed into the tower.
   [34] I saw the angels actively taking part in the showing forth of
   these visions. There rose, however, from the depths below a series of
   what seemed to be false visions, for I saw the angels combating these
   and thrusting them aside. Many of these false visions I have forgotten,
   but here is what I still remember about them.

   I saw a church rise up from below, almost in the same form in which the
   holy universal Church always appears to me when I see it not as a
   particular building but as the Holy Catholic Church in general. There
   was, however, this difference, that the latter has a tower over the
   entrance and the church rising from the depths had not. It was a very
   large church but a false one. The angels thrust it aside so that it
   stood all crooked. I also saw a great bowl, with a lip on one side;
   which tried to enter the false church but was also thrust aside. I then
   saw the angels preparing a chalice, of the shape of the Chalice of the
   Last Supper, which passed into the tower entered by the virgin. I also
   saw a lower tower or building appear, with many doors, through which I
   saw crowds of people passing, among them figures like Abraham and the
   Children of Israel. I think this had reference to the slavery in Egypt.
   I saw a round terraced tower arise, which also had reference to Egypt.
   This was thrust back and made to stand crooked. I also saw an Egyptian
   temple arise, like the one on the ceiling of which I had seen the
   Egyptian priests, idolaters, fastening the image of a winged virgin
   after receiving from Elijah' messenger communications of a prophetic
   vision of the Blessed Virgin. I will speak of his vision later; it was
   seen by the prophet on Mount Carmel. This temple, too, was thrust back
   and made to stand crooked.

   I then saw between the choirs of angels, to the right of the holy
   tower, a branch which put forth buds, making a whole ancestral tree of
   little male and female figures holding each other's hands. This family
   tree ended with the appearance of a little crib with a little child in
   it. The crib was of the same shape as the one I had seen exposed in the
   temple of the Three Kings. [35] Then I saw a beautiful great church
   appear.

   The way in which all these pictures were united with each other and yet
   melted one into the other was very wonderful. The whole vision was
   indescribably rich and full of significance. Even the hateful, evil,
   false appearances of towers, chalices, and churches, which were thrust
   aside, were made to assist in the unfolding of the scheme of salvation.

   [When recounting these scattered visions, she came back again and again
   to the unspeakable joy of the angels. There was no real conclusion to
   these fragmentary visions, which seem to have been a series of symbolic
   pictures of the history of our salvation. She added: First of all I saw
   the emblems of the work of redemption among the choirs of angels, and
   then a series of pictures from Adam down to the Babylonian captivity.']

  2.2 AN EGYPTIAN REPRESENTATION OF MARY PRIOR TO ELIJAH.

   I saw something happening in Egypt very long ago which had a symbolic
   application to the Blessed Virgin. It must have been long before the
   days of Elijah. I also saw something in Egypt, in his lifetime, which I
   will tell later.

   I saw a place in Egypt, much farther away from the Promised Land than
   On or Heliopolis, where on an island in the river an idol stood. This
   idol had a head which was something between that of a man and of an ox,
   with three horns, one in the middle of the forehead. The figure was
   hollow, and had openings in its body in which sacrifices were burnt as
   in an oven. Its feet were like claws, and in one hand it held a plant
   like a lily which grows out of the water and opens and shuts with the
   sun. In the other hand the idol held a plant like ears of corn with
   quite thick grains; I think it grows out of the water too, but am not
   quite sure of this. After a great victory a temple had been built in
   honor of this idol, which was now to be consecrated, and all
   preparations had been made for the sacrifice. But as the people were on
   their way to the island I saw something wonderful happen. Near the idol
   I saw a dark and dreadful apparition, and then I saw a great angel
   descending upon it from heaven like the one who appeared to St. John
   the Evangelist in the Apocalypse. This angel struck the dark figure in
   the back with his staff. The demon, writhing, was forced to speak out
   of the mouth of the idol, warning the people to consecrate the temple,
   not in honor of it but of a virgin who was to appear upon earth and to
   whom thanks for their victory were due. I cannot remember the exact
   circumstances, but I saw that the people set up in the new temple the
   image of a winged virgin, which was fixed to the wall. The virgin as
   she flew was bending down over a little ship in which lay a child in
   swaddling clothes. The ship stood on a little pillar, with a leafy top
   like a tree. One of her outstretched hands had a balance hanging from
   it, and I saw two figures beside her on the wall who were putting
   something into each scale of the balance. The little ship in which the
   child lay was like that in which Moses lay on the Nile, but it was
   uncovered, whereas Moses' one was entirely closed in except for a small
   opening at the top.

  2.3 ELIJAH'S VISION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

   I saw the whole Promised Land withered and parched with drought, and I
   saw Elijah ascending Mount Carmel with two servants to beseech God to
   give rain. First they climbed over a high ridge, then up steps of rock
   to a terrace, then up many more rock steps, and so reached a great open
   space with a hill of rocks in its midst in which was a cave. Elijah
   climbed up steps to the top of this rocky hill. He left the servants at
   the edge of the open space and bade one of them look towards the Sea of
   Galilee, which had, however, a terrible aspect, for it was quite dried
   up and was full of hollows and caverns with rotting bodies of animals
   in the swampy ground. Elijah crouched down on the ground with his head
   sunk between his knees, and covering himself in his mantle prayed
   fervently to God and cried seven times to his servant to know whether
   he did not see a cloud rising out of the lake. At his seventh call I
   saw the cloud rise up, and saw the servant announce it to Elijah, who
   sent him to King Ahab. I saw a white eddy form itself in the middle of
   the lake; out of this eddy rose a little black cloud like a fist, which
   opened and spread itself out. In this little cloud I saw from the first
   a little shining figure like a virgin. I saw, too, that Elijah
   perceived this figure in the spreading cloud. The head of this virgin
   was encircled with rays; she stretched her arms out in the form of a
   cross, and had a triumphal wreath hanging from one hand. Her long robe
   seemed to be tied beneath her feet. She appeared as if hovering above
   the whole Promised Land in the cloud as it spread ever farther. I saw
   how this cloud divided into different parts and fell in eddying showers
   of crystal dew on certain holy and consecrated places inhabited by
   devout men and those who were praying for salvation. I saw these
   showers edged with the colors of the rainbow and the blessing taking
   shape in their midst like a pearl in its shell. It was explained to me
   that this was a symbolic picture, and that the favored places watered
   by the showers from the cloud were in fact those which had had their
   share in contributing to the coming of the Blessed Virgin.

   I saw as well a prophetic vision of how Elijah, while the cloud was
   rising, discerned four mysteries relating to the Blessed Virgin.
   Unfortunately I have forgotten the details, and much else, as a result
   of disturbances and interruptions. Elijah discerned in the cloud, among
   other things, that Mary would be born in the seventh age of the world;
   hence his sevenfold call to his servant. He saw, too, from what family
   she was to come. On one side of the country he saw a low but very broad
   family tree, and on the other a very high one, broad at the base but
   tapering towards its top, which bent down into the first tree. He
   understood all this, and discerned in this way four mysteries relating
   to the future mother of the Savior. Hereupon I had a vision of how
   Elijah enlarged the cave above which he had prayed and how he made the
   Sons of the Prophets into a more regular organization. Some of these
   were always praying in this cave for the coming of the Blessed Virgin
   and paying her honor in anticipation of her future birth. I saw that
   this devotion to the Blessed Virgin continued here uninterrupted, that
   the Essenes carried it on during Mary's earthly life, and that
   subsequently it was perpetuated up to our time by hermits and the
   Carmelite Order which eventually succeeded them. [36]

  2.4 AN EXPOUNDING ON ELIJAH'S VISION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

   [When Catherine Emmerich communicated later her visions of the time of
   John the Baptist, she saw the same vision of Elijah with reference to
   the state of the country and of mankind which prevailed in St. John's
   time. We therefore reproduce from this what follows as explanatory of
   what she has said above.]

   I saw a great commotion in the Temple at Jerusalem, much consultation,
   much writing with reed pens, and messengers being sent about the
   country. Rain was besought from God with cries and supplications, and
   search was made everywhere for Elijah. I saw Elijah receiving food and
   drink in the wilderness from the angel, who held a vessel like a little
   shining barrel with white and red diagonal stripes. I saw all Elijah'
   dealings with Ahab, the sacrifice on Mount Carmel, the slaughter of the
   priests of Baal, Elijah' prayer for rain and the gathering of the
   clouds. I saw as well as the dryness of the earth, a great dryness and
   failing of good fruit amongst men. I saw that by his prayer Elijah
   called forth the blessing of which the cloud was the form, and that he
   guided and distributed its showers in accordance with inner visions;
   otherwise it might perhaps have become a destroying deluge. He asked
   his servant seven times for news of the cloud; this signifies the seven
   generations or ages of the world which must go by before the real
   blessing (of which this cloud of blessing was but a symbol) took root
   in Israel. Elijah himself saw in the ascending cloud an image of the
   Blessed Virgin, and discerned several mysteries relating to her birth
   and descent. [37]

   I saw that Elijah' prayer called down the blessing at first in the form
   of dew. Layers of cloud sank down which formed themselves into eddies
   with rainbow edges; these finally dissolved into falling drops. I saw
   therein an association with the manna in the desert, but the manna lay
   thick and crisp on the ground in the morning like fleeces, and could be
   rolled up and taken away. I saw this whirling eddy of dew floating
   along the banks of the Jordan, but dropping down only at certain
   notable places, not everywhere. In particular at Ainon, opposite Salem,
   and at the places where baptisms took place later, I clearly saw these
   shining eddies floating downwards. I asked what the colored edges of
   these dew eddies portended, and was given as an explanation the example
   of the mother-of-pearl shells in the sea which also bore edges of
   shining color; they expose themselves to the sun, absorbing the light
   and cleansing it of color until the pure white pearls take form in
   their centers. It was shown to me, too, that this dew and the rain that
   followed it was something much more than the ordinary refreshing of the
   earth by moisture. I was given clearly to understand that, without this
   dew, the coming of the Blessed Virgin would have been delayed by more
   than a hundred years; whereas, after this softening and blessing of the
   earth, nourishment and refreshment were imparted to the human beings
   who lived on the fruits of the soil; the blessing communicated itself
   to their bodies and ennobled them. This fructifying dew was associated
   with the coming of the Messiah, for I saw its rays penetrating
   generation after generation until they reached the substance of the
   body of the Blessed Virgin. I cannot describe this. Sometimes, on the
   colored edge that I have mentioned I saw emerge one or more pearls
   having the likeness of a human figure which disappeared in a breath to
   unite itself with others of these pearls. The picture of the pearl
   shell was a symbol of Mary and Jesus.

   I saw, too, that just as the earth and mankind were parched and panting
   for rain, so, at a later time, was the spirit of man thirsting for the
   baptism of John; so that the whole picture was not only a prophecy of
   the coming of the Blessed Virgin, but also of the state of the people
   at the time of the Baptist. In the first instance there was the alarm
   of the people, their longing for rain and their search for Elijah,
   followed, nevertheless, by their persecution of him; and later there
   was a like yearning of the people for baptism and penance, and again
   the lack of comprehension by the synagogue and its messages to John.

  2.5 A REPRESENTATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN IN EGYPT.

   In Egypt I saw the message of salvation being announced in the
   following manner. I saw that by God's command Elijah sent messages to
   summon devout families scattered about in three regions to the east,
   north, and south. For this purpose he sent forth three of the sons of
   the prophets, but only after asking a sign from God that he had decided
   rightly, for it was a difficult and dangerous mission, and he had to
   choose messengers whose prudence would lessen the danger of their being
   murdered. One traveled northwards, one eastwards, and the third
   southwards. This last one had to pass through a considerable part of
   Egyptian territory, where the Israelites were in particular danger of
   being killed. This messenger took the way followed by the Holy Family
   on their flight into Egypt. I think, too, that he passed near On, where
   the Child Jesus took refuge. I saw him come to an idolatrous temple on
   a great plain; in this temple, which was surrounded by a meadow and by
   many other buildings, they adored a living bull. They had an image of a
   bull and many other idols in their temple; their sacrifices were
   gruesome and they slaughtered deformed children. They seized the son of
   the prophet and brought him before the priests. Fortunately, the latter
   were very inquisitive; otherwise, they might easily have murdered him.
   They questioned him as to whence he came and what brought him there,
   and he answered without hesitation, telling them how a virgin would be
   born from whom the salvation of the world was to come, and that then
   all their idols would fall in pieces. [38]

   They were amazed at his announcement, seemed greatly moved thereby, and
   let him go unharmed. I saw them taking counsel together thereafter, and
   having the image of a virgin constructed and fixed in the middle of the
   temple roof. This image [See Figure 4], represented as floating
   downwards at full length, had a headdress like the idols, so many of
   which lie in rows there, half like a woman, half like a lion. On the
   top of the head was something like a little high vessel or bushel of
   fruit; the elbows were close to the body, while the forearms were held
   out in a gesture as it were of withdrawal and repulse. In her hands
   were ears of corn. She had three breasts; a large one in the middle,
   with two smaller ones on each side of it but lower down. The lower part
   of the body was clothed in a long dress, and from the feet, which were
   comparatively small and pointed, hung tassels or something of the sort.
   She had as it were wings on her arms both above and below the elbows;
   these wings seemed to be made of delicate feathers spreading out on
   each side like rays and intertwined with each other. Feathers ran
   crosswise down both thighs and over the middle of the body to the feet.
   The dress had no folds. They venerated this image and sacrificed to it,
   begging it not to destroy their God Apis and their other gods. At the
   same time they continued their gruesome idolatry as before, except that
   they always began by invoking this virgin. In making this image they
   had, I believe, followed the indications given them by the son of the
   prophet in his account of the vision which Elijah had seen.

   Figure 4. Egyptian idol of the blessed virgin Mary constructed after
   receiving Elijah's prophesy. [39]

  2.6 MARY PROCLAIMED TO PIOUS PAGANS.

   I saw also that by the great mercy of God it was announced to certain
   God-fearing heathens that the Messiah was to be born from a virgin in
   Judea. The ancestors of the three holy kings, the star-worshippers of
   Chaldea, received this message by the appearance of a picture in a star
   or in the sky, by which they made prophecies. I saw traces of these
   prophetic images of the Blessed Virgin in the pictures in their temple,
   which I have described in my account of Jesus' visit to them after the
   raising of Lazarus in the last quarter of the third year of His
   ministry.

  2.7 THE LIFE STORY OF TOBIAS. AN ALLEGORY OF THE COMING OF SALVATION.

   [On the feast of the Archangel Michael in September 1821, Catherine
   Emmerich recounted, amongst other fragments of a vision of the holy
   angels, the following fragment of the story of Tobias, whom she had
   seen with the Archangel Raphael as his guide.]

   I saw many things from the life of Tobias, which is an allegory of the
   history of the coming of salvation in Israel; not an imaginative
   allegory, but one which actually happened and was lived. It was shown
   to me that Sarah, the wife of the young Tobias, was a prototype of St.
   Anne. I will relate as much as I can remember of the many things that
   happened, but shall not be able to reproduce them in their right order.
   The elder Tobias was an emblem of the God-fearing branch of the Jewish
   race, those who were hoping for the Messiah. The swallow, the messenger
   of spring, indicated the near approach of salvation. The blindness of
   old Tobias signified that he was to beget no more children, and was to
   devote himself entirely to prayer and meditation; it signified also the
   faithful, though dim, longing and waiting for the light of salvation
   and the uncertainty as to whence it was to come. Tobias' quarrelsome
   wife represented the empty and harassing forms into which the Pharisees
   had converted the Law. The kid which she had brought home in lieu of
   wages had, as Tobias warned her, really been stolen, and had for that
   reason been handed on to her in return for very little. Tobias knew the
   people concerned and all about it, but his wife only mocked him. This
   mockery also indicated the contempt of the Pharisees and formalists for
   the devout Jews and Essenes and the relationship between the two
   groups, but I cannot now remember how this was.

   The Archangel Raphael was not telling an untruth when he said that he
   was Azarias, the son of Ananias, for the general meaning of these words
   is: The help of the Lord out of the cloud of the Lord'. [40] This
   angel, the companion of young Tobias, represented God's watchfulness
   over the Blessed Virgin's descent through her ancestors and His
   preservation and guidance of the Blessing through the generations which
   preceded her conception. In the prayer of the Elder Tobias, and of
   Sarah, the daughter of Raguel (I saw both these prayers being brought
   by the angels at one and the same time before the Throne of God and
   there granted), I recognized the supplications of the God-fearing
   Israelites and of the Daughters of Sion for the coming of salvation, as
   well as the simultaneous prayers of Joachim and Anna, separated from
   each other, for the promised offspring. The blindness of the elder
   Tobias and his wife's mockery of him also symbolized Joachim's
   childlessness and the rejection of his sacrifice at the Temple. The
   seven husbands of Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, who were destroyed by
   Satan, came to their end through sensuality; for Sarah had made a vow
   to give herself only to a chaste and God-fearing man. These seven men
   symbolized those whose entry into Jesus' ancestry according to the
   flesh would have hindered the coming of the Blessed Virgin, and thus
   the advent of salvation. There was also a reference to certain
   unblessed periods in the history of salvation and to the suitors whom
   Anna had to reject that she might be united to Joachim, the father of
   Mary. The maidservant's reviling of Sarah ( Tob. 3.7) symbolized the
   reviling by the heathen and by the godless and unbelieving among the
   Jews against the expectation of the Messiah, for whose coming all
   God-fearing Jews were, like Sarah, inspired to pray with
   ever-increasing fervor. It was also an image of the reviling of Anna by
   her maidservant, whereafter that holy mother prayed with such fervor
   that her prayer was granted. The fish which was about to swallow young
   Tobias symbolized the powers of darkness, heathendom, and sin striving
   against the coming of salvation, and also Anna's long barrenness. The
   killing of the fish, the removal of its heart, liver, and gall, and the
   burning of this by Tobias and Sarah to make smoke--all these symbolized
   the victory over the demon of fleshly lusts who had strangled Sarah's
   seven husbands, as well as the good works and continence of Joachim and
   Anna, by which they had obtained the blessing of holy fruitfulness. I
   also saw therein a deep significance relating to the Blessed Sacrament,
   but can no longer explain this. The gall of the fish, which restored
   the sight of Tobias' father, symbolized the bitterness of the suffering
   through which the chosen ones among the Jews came to know and share in
   salvation; it indicated also the entry of the light into the darkness
   brought about by Jesus' bitter sufferings from His birth onwards.

   I received many explanations of this kind, and saw many details of the
   history of Tobias. I think the descendants of young Tobias were among
   the ancestors of Joachim and Anna. The elder Tobias had other children
   who were not godly. Sarah had three daughters and four sons. Her first
   child was a daughter. The elder Tobias lived to see his grandchildren.

  2.8 THE GENEALOGICAL TREE OF THE MESSIAH.

   I saw the line of the descent of the Messiah proceeding from David and
   dividing into two branches. The right-hand one went through Solomon
   down to Jacob, the father of St. Joseph. I saw the figures of all St.
   Joseph's ancestors named in the Gospel on this right-hand branch of the
   descent from David through Solomon. This branch has the greater
   significance of the two; I saw the line of descent issuing from the
   mouths of the separate figures in streams of white colorless light. The
   figures were taller and looked more spiritual than those of the
   left-hand line. Each one held a long flower stem with hanging leaves
   like those of palms: this stem was crowned with a great bell-shaped
   flower shaped like a lily and having five stamens, yellow at the top,
   from which a fine yellow dust was scattered. These flowers differed in
   size, vigor, and beauty. The flower borne by Joseph, the foster-father
   of Jesus, was the most beautiful and purest of all, with fresh and
   abundant petals. Halfway down this ancestral tree were three rejected
   shoots, blackened and withered. In this line through Solomon there were
   several gaps separating its fruits more widely from each other. The
   right-hand and left-hand branches met several times, and they crossed
   each other at a point a few generations before the end. I was given an
   explanation about the higher significance of the line of descent
   through Solomon. It had in it more of the spirit and less of the flesh,
   and had some of the significance belonging to Solomon himself. I cannot
   express this.

   The left-hand line of descent went from David through Nathan down to
   Heli, which is the real name of Joachim, Mary's father, for he did not
   receive the name of Joachim till later, just as Abram was not called
   Abraham until later. I forget the reason, but it will perhaps come back
   to me. In my visions I often hear Jesus called after the flesh a son of
   Heli. [41]

   I saw this whole line from David through Nathan flowing at a lower
   level: it generally issued from the navels of the separate figures. I
   saw it colored red, yellow, or white, but never blue. Here and there
   were stains; then the stream became clear again. The figures upon it
   were smaller than those of the line through Solomon. They carried
   smaller branches which hung down sideways and had little yellow-green
   leaves with serrated edges; their branches were crowned with reddish
   buds of the color of wild roses. These were always closed; they were
   not flower buds but the beginnings of fruits. A double row of little
   twigs hung down on the same side as the serrated leaves. At a point
   three or four generations above Heli or Joachim, the two lines crossed
   each other and rose up, ending with the Blessed Virgin. [42] At the
   point of crossing I think I already saw the blood of the Blessed Virgin
   beginning to shine in the stream of descent.

   St. Anne descended on her father's side from Levi, and on her mother's
   side, from Benjamin. I saw in a vision the Ark of the Covenant being
   borne by her ancestors with great piety and devotion; I saw them
   receiving rays of blessing from it which extended to their descendants,
   to Anna and to Mary. I always saw many priests in the house of Anna's
   parents, and also in Joachim's house; this was the result of the
   relationship with Zechariah and Elizabeth.

  2.9 APPARITION OF SAINT ANNE.

   [On the afternoon of July 26 ^th, 1819, Sister Emmerich, after relating
   many things about Anna, the Blessed Virgin's holy mother, fell asleep
   as she was praying. After a while she sneezed three times and exclaimed
   impatiently, but still half asleep, O, why must I wake up?' Then she
   woke up completely and said with a smile: I was in a much better place,
   I was much better off than here. I was being much comforted, and then
   all of a sudden I was woken by my sneeze and someone said to me "You
   must wake up ", but I did not want to, I was so happy there and was
   annoyed at having to go away, then I had to sneeze, and I woke up.'

   [Next day she told me:] I had just fallen asleep last night after
   saying my prayers when someone whom I recognized as a young girl I had
   often seen before came to my bed. She said to me rather shortly: You
   have been speaking a great deal about me today, you shall now have a
   sight of me, so that you may make no mistakes.' So I asked her: Have I
   perhaps talked too much?' She answered abruptly No!' and disappeared.
   She was still a girl, slim and attractive, her head was covered with a
   white hood, drawn together at the back of her neck and ending there in
   a hanging knot as if her hair were inside it. Her long dress, which
   completely covered her, was of whitish wool; the sleeves of it seemed
   to be rather full at the elbows. Over this she wore a long cloak of
   brownish wool, like camel's hair.

   Hardly had I had time to feel touched and pleased by this vision, when
   suddenly I saw by my bed an aged woman in similar dress with her head
   more bent and very hollow cheeks--a Jewess of some fifty years, thin
   but handsome. Why,' I thought, does this old Jewess come to me?' Then
   she said: You need not be afraid; I only want to show you how I was
   when I bore the mother of the Lord, so that you may make no mistakes.'
   I asked at once: O, where is the dear little child Mary?' and she
   replied: I have not got her with me now.' Then I asked again: How old
   is she now?' And she answered: Four years old.' I asked her once more:
   But have I spoken rightly?' and she said shortly, Yes.' I asked her: O,
   please do not let me say too much!' She did not answer and disappeared.

   Then I woke up, and thought over everything that I had seen of Anna and
   of the childhood of the Blessed Virgin, and everything became clear to
   me and I felt blissfully happy. Next morning, when I was again asleep,
   I had a new and very beautiful vision. I thought I could not forget it,
   but the next day brought with it so many interruptions and sufferings
   that nothing of it remains in my mind.

  2.10 VISION OF THE FEAST OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION [43] .

   During the whole night I saw a terrible, horrifying picture of the sins
   of the whole world; but towards morning I fell asleep again and was
   transported to the place in Jerusalem where the Temple had stood, and
   then on to the region of Nazareth, where the house of Joachim and Anna
   used to stand. I recognized the country round. Here I saw a slender
   column of light rising out of the earth like the stem of a flower. This
   column was crowned with the appearance of a shining octagonal church,
   which grew forth from the stem like the calyx of a flower or the seed
   vessel of a poppy. [44] The column grew up within this church like a
   little tree, with symmetrical branches bearing the figures of those
   among the Blessed Virgin's family who were the objects of veneration on
   this feast. It was as if they were standing on the stamens of a flower.
   I saw the Blessed Virgin's holy mother St. Anne, standing between
   Joachim and another man, her father perhaps. Beneath St. Anne's breast
   I saw a space filled with light, somewhat in the shape of a chalice,
   and in this I saw the figure of a shining child growing and developing.
   Its little hands were crossed on its breast and its little head was
   bent, and countless rays of light issued from it towards one part of
   the world. (I thought it strange that they did not shine in all
   directions.) On others of the surrounding branches were many figures
   turned towards the center in veneration, and all round within the
   church I saw orders and choirs of saints, countless in number, all
   turning in prayer towards that holy mother. This celebration, in the
   sweetness of its harmony and devotion, can only be compared to a meadow
   of innumerable flowers, stirred by a gentle wind and lifting their
   heads to offer their scents and their colors to the sun from which they
   have received life itself and all they have to offer. Above this
   symbolical picture of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception the tree
   of light sent up another shoot, and in this second crown I saw a
   further moment of the feast being celebrated. Mary and Joseph were
   kneeling here, and a little lower St. Anne, all in adoration of the
   child Jesus, whom I saw above them in the top of the tree, holding in
   His hand the orb or globe and surrounded by an infinite glory of light.
   Around this scene, and bowing in adoration before it, were, nearest of
   all, the three holy kings, the shepherds, and the apostles and
   disciples; farther away other saints joined in the choirs of
   worshippers. In the light from above I saw indistinct figures of Powers
   and Principalities, and still higher I saw as it were a half-sun, its
   light streaming down through the dome of the church. This second
   picture seemed to indicate the approach of the Feast of the Nativity
   after the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. When the picture first
   appeared, I seemed to be standing outside the church, looking outwards
   from under the pillar; later I saw into the inside of the church as I
   have described it. I saw, too, the little child Mary developing in the
   space of light under St. Anne's heart, and received, at the same
   moment, an inexpressible conviction of the Immaculate Conception. I
   read it as clearly as in a book, and understood it. It was shown to me,
   that a church to the glory of God had once stood here, but had been
   given over to destruction in consequence of unworthy disputes about
   this holy mystery; that the Church Triumphant, however, still
   celebrated this feast on this spot.

  2.11 THE BLESSED VIRGIN REVEALS SECRETS ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

   [During her visions of Jesus' ministry Catherine Emmerich related the
   following on December 16 ^th, 1822.]

   I often hear the Blessed Virgin telling the women who were her close
   intimates (for instance, Joanna Chuza and Susanna of Jerusalem) various
   secrets about herself and about Our Lord, which she knows partly from
   inner knowledge and partly from what her holy mother Anna told her.
   Thus today I heard her telling Susanna and Martha that during the time
   when she was bearing Our Lord within her she never felt the slightest
   discomfort, nothing but infinite inner joy and beatitude. She told
   them, too, that Joachim and Anna had met in the hall under the Golden
   Gate in a golden hour; and that God's grace had been granted to them
   here in such abundance as to make it possible for her alone, from her
   parents' holy obedience and pure love of God, to have been conceived in
   her mother's womb without any stain of sin. She also explained to them
   that but for the Fall the conception of all men would have been as
   pure. She spoke, too, of her beloved elder sister Mary Heli, that her
   parents had realized that she was not the promised fruit, and how, in
   their longing for that fruit, they had long practiced continence. It
   was a joy to me to hear now from the Blessed Virgin herself what I have
   always seen about her elder sister. I saw now the whole sequence of
   grace received by Mary's parents just as I have always described it,
   from the appearance of the angel to Anna and Joachim down to their
   meeting under the Golden Gate; that is to say, in the subterranean ball
   under the Golden Gate. I saw Joachim and Anna encompassed by a host of
   angels with heavenly light. They themselves shone and were as pure as
   spirits in a supernatural state, as no human couple had ever been
   before them. I think that the Golden Gate itself was the scene of the
   examination and absolution of women accused of adultery, and that other
   ceremonies of reconciliation took place here. [45] There were five of
   these subterranean passages under the Temple, and one also under the
   part where the virgins lived. These were used for certain ceremonies of
   atonement. I do not know whether others before Joachim and Anna had
   gone there, but I think the place was very seldom visited. I cannot at
   present recall whether it was in general connected with sacrifices
   offered by the unfruitful, but the priests had been given some order
   about it.

  2.12 CELEBRATION OF THE CONCEPTION OF MARY IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS.

   [On December 8 ^th, 1820, on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception of
   Mary, the soul of Catherine Emmerich was transported in an active state
   of prayer and meditation over a great part of the earth. The whole of
   this visionary journey will be described in its proper place, but in
   the meantime we will reproduce the following extracts from it in order
   to give some idea of these journeyings of her soul.

   [She came to Rome, was with the Holy Father, visited a much-loved and
   devout nun in Sardinia, reached Palestine after a short visit to
   Palermo, went to India, and thence to what she calls the mountain of
   the Prophet. [46] Thence she journeyed to Abyssinia, where she came to
   a strange Jewish city on a high mountain rock and visited its ruler
   Judith, [47] with whom she spoke of the Messiah, of that day's feast of
   the Conception of His Mother, of the holy Advent time, and of the
   approaching Feast of His Birth. During the whole of this journey she
   did all that a conscientious missionary would have done on a similar
   journey to carry out his task and make use of his opportunities; she
   prayed, taught, helped, comforted, and learnt. But in order to make
   plain to the reader, in her own words, what she perceived on this
   journey regarding the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, we must refer
   him to the note on page 46, in which that part of Jesus' ministry to
   which she here alludes is described in detail.]

   When in my great dream-journey I came into the Promised Land, I saw all
   those things which I have related about the Conception of the Blessed
   Virgin. Thereupon I entered into the daily visions of Our Lord's
   ministry and had today reached the 8 ^th of December of the third year
   of His teaching. I found Jesus not in the Promised Land, but was
   brought by my guide eastwards over the Jordan to Arabia, where the
   Lord, accompanied by three young men, was in a tent city of the three
   holy kings in which they had settled after their return from Bethlehem.

  2.13 THE HOLY KINGS CELEBRATE A FEAST HONORING MARY'S CONCEPTION.

   I saw that the two holy kings who were still alive were celebrating
   with their tribe a three-day feast starting from today, December 8 ^th.
   On this night, fifteen years before Christ's birth, they had seen for
   the first time the star promised by Balaam rise in the sky [ Num.
   24.17: A star shall rise out of Jacob']--the star for which they and
   their forefathers had waited so long, scanning the heavens in patient
   watchfulness. They discerned in it the picture of a virgin, bearing in
   one hand a scepter and in the other a balance. The scales were held
   even by a perfect ear of wheat in the one and by a cluster of grapes in
   the other. Therefore every year since their return from Bethlehem they
   kept a three-day feast beginning with this day.

  2.14 ELIMINATION OF HUMAN SACRIFICE BY THE STAR-WORSHIPPERS.

   I saw, too, that as a result of this vision on the day of the
   conception of Mary, fifteen years before the birth of Christ, these
   star-worshippers did away with a terrible religious custom of theirs--a
   cruel sacrifice of children, long practiced among them as the result of
   revelations which had been misunderstood by them and confused by evil
   influences. They had carried out at different times and in different
   manners sacrifices of both children and grown people. I saw that before
   Mary's conception they had the following custom. They took a child of
   one of the purest and most devout mothers amongst the followers of
   their religion, and she esteemed herself very fortunate to offer up her
   child in this way. The child was flayed and strewn with flour to absorb
   the blood. They ate this blood-soaked flour as a holy repast, and
   continued strewing the flour and eating until there was no blood left
   in the child's body. Finally the child's flesh was cut up into small
   pieces, which were distributed among them and eaten. [48] I saw them
   performing this gruesome ceremony with the greatest simplicity and
   devoutness, and I was told that they had adopted this dreadful practice
   as a result of misunderstanding and distorting certain prophetic and
   symbolical indications which they had received regarding the Holy
   Eucharist. I saw that this terrible sacrifice was carried on in
   Chaldea, in the country of Mensor, one of the three holy kings, until
   he put an end to its horrors on receiving enlightenment in a vision
   from heaven on the day of Mary's conception. I saw him on a high wooden
   pyramidal edifice, engaged in studying the stars, as his people had
   done for centuries in accordance with their ancient traditions. I saw
   King Mensor lying in an ecstasy as he contemplated the stars; his limbs
   were rigid and he had lost consciousness. His companions came to him
   and brought him back to himself, but at first he seemed not to know
   them at all. He had seen the picture in the star with the Virgin, the
   scales, the ear of corn, and the cluster of grapes, and had received an
   inner admonition, after which that cruel ceremony was abolished.

  2.15 A PARALLEL VISION OF CHILD SACRIFICE.

   After seeing at night in my sleep the fearful picture of the murdered
   child on my right hand, I turned over in horror in my bed, but saw it
   again on my left hand. I begged God most earnestly to free me from this
   dreadful sight. I woke up and heard the clock strike. My heavenly
   Bridegroom said to me, pointing round Him as He spoke: See far more
   evil that befalls Me every day at the hands of many throughout the
   whole world.' And as I looked about me into the distance, many things
   came before my soul which were indeed still more dreadful than that
   sacrifice of children; for I saw Jesus Himself cruelly sacrificed on
   the Altar by unworthy and sinful celebrations of the Holy Mysteries. I
   saw how the blessed Host lay on the altar before unworthy degenerate
   priests like a living Child Jesus, whom they cut and terribly mutilated
   with the paten. Their sacrifice, though an efficacious celebration of
   the Holy Mysteries, appeared like a cruel murder. [49]

   The same cruelty was shown to me in the heartless treatment of the
   members of Christ, His followers, and God's adopted children. I saw at
   the present time countless good, unhappy men being everywhere
   oppressed, tormented, and persecuted; and I always saw that it was
   Jesus who suffered this ill-treatment. The times are terrible; a refuge
   is no longer anywhere to be found; a dense cloud of sin lies over the
   whole world, and I see men giving way to the worst crimes with complete
   indifference and unconcern. I saw all this in many visions while my
   soul was being led through many lands over the whole earth. At last I
   came back to the visions of the Feast of Mary's Conception.

  2.16 HISTORY OF THE CELEBRATIONS OF THE CONCEPTION OF MARY.

   I am quite unable to tell in what a wonderful way I journeyed last
   night in dream. I was in the most different parts of the world and in
   the most different ages, and very often saw the Feast of Mary's
   Conception being celebrated in the most different places. I was in
   Ephesus, and saw this feast being celebrated in the house of the Mother
   of God, which was still standing there as a church. It must have been
   at a very early time, for I saw the Way of the Cross set up by Mary
   herself still in perfect preservation. [The second Way of the Cross was
   set up in Jerusalem and the third in Rome.]

   The Greeks kept this feast long before the schism. I still remember
   something of this, but am not quite sure what led up to it. I saw how a
   saint, Sabbas, I think, had a vision relating to the Immaculate
   Conception. He saw the picture of the Blessed Virgin on the globe,
   crushing the head of the serpent under her feet, and recognized that
   the Blessed Virgin alone was conceived unwounded and unstained by the
   serpent. [50] I saw, too, that one of the Greek churches or one of the
   Greek bishops refused to accept this truth unless the picture came to
   them across the sea. Then I saw the appearance of the picture float
   over the sea to their church and appear on the altar, whereupon they
   began to keep the feast. That church possessed a life-size picture of
   the Blessed Virgin painted by St. Luke just as she was in her earthly
   life, in a white robe and veil. (I have an idea that this picture had
   been sent from Rome, where they have only a half-length portrait.) They
   had placed the picture above the altar in the place where the vision of
   the Immaculate Conception had appeared. I think it was in
   Constantinople, or perhaps I have seen it venerated there in earlier
   times.

   I was in England, too, and saw the feast being introduced and
   celebrated there in olden times. In this connection I saw the day
   before yesterday, on the Feast of St. Nicholas, the following miracle.
   I saw an abbot, coming from England, in great danger in a ship in a
   storm. They prayed very fervently for the protection of the Mother of
   God, and I saw an apparition of the holy bishop Nicholas of Myra
   floating over the sea to the ship and telling the abbot that he had
   been sent by Mary to announce to him that he was to cause the Feast of
   the Immaculate Conception to be kept in England on December 8 ^th, and
   that then the ship would arrive safely. In reply to the abbot's
   question as to what prayers should be used for this feast, he answered,
   the same as those for Mary's nativity. The name of Anselm [51] was also
   associated with the introduction of this feast, but I have forgotten
   the details.

   I also saw the introduction of this feast into France, and how St.
   Bernard wrote in opposition to it because its introduction had not come
   from Rome. [52]

3. THE ACTUAL SEASON OF MARY'S CONCEPTION (NOTE BY THE WRITER).

   All that has so far been recorded of the blessing given to Joachim and
   Anna is compiled from visions and reminiscences of Catherine Emmerich
   during the feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8 ^th. She
   explained, however, on that day in the year 1821 that the meeting of
   Joachim and Anna under the Golden Gate did not occur in December but in
   the autumn, at the end of the Feast of Tabernacles (which lasted from
   the 15 ^th to 23 ^rd of the month Tisri, i.e. in September or October).
   [53] Thus she saw Joachim building tabernacles with his shepherds (see
   p. 22 ) before going to the Temple, and Anna receiving the promise of
   fruitfulness while she was praying under a tree which formed a
   tabernacle. In the previous year, 1820, she had, however, stated that
   she remembered Joachim having gone up to Jerusalem with his offerings
   on the occasion of a dedication festival. This cannot be the usual
   Jewish dedication feast in the winter (the 25 ^th day of the month,
   Kislev), but must doubtless be a memorial festival of Solomon's
   dedication of the Temple. According to Catherine Emmerich's daily
   accounts of the three years of Jesus' ministry, Our Lord was in Aruma
   (a few hours' distant from Salem) at the close of the Feast of
   Tabernacles in the second year of His ministry, and taught there about
   the approaching destruction of the Temple.

   This feast is, it is true, not mentioned in the works about Jewish
   antiquities which we commonly consult, but its existence cannot, I
   think, be doubted, apart from Catherine Emmerich's statements, if it is
   remembered that Solomon celebrated the consecration of his Temple in
   connection with the Feast of Tabernacles (3 Kings 8.2-66, and 2
   Chronicles 7.10), and that the Masora on 3 Kings 8.2 and 54 appoints
   the account of the consecration of Solomon's Temple as festival lessons
   for the second and eighth days of the Feast of Tabernacles. Although
   Catherine Emmerich saw the meeting of Joachim and Anna happening at the
   close of the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus two months earlier than the
   Church's celebration of Mary's conception, it was always on the
   occasion of that feast on December 8 ^th that she was impelled to
   communicate visions about the Blessed Virgin's conception. She said,
   too, that it was on that day, not at the time of the Feast of
   Tabernacles in the autumn, that the remembrance of this grace-bringing
   event was already being celebrated by the three holy kings when Christ
   visited them in Arabia after the raising of Lazarus.

   Here end the additional communications by Catherine Emmerich about the
   conception of Mary: the story of the Blessed Virgin's life is now
   resumed.

4. THE INFUSING OF MARY'S SOUL AND HER BIRTH.

  4.1 THE UNITING OF MARY'S SOUL AND BODY.

   I had a vision of the creation of Mary's most holy soul and of its
   being united to her most pure body. In the glory by which the Most Holy
   Trinity is usually represented in my visions I saw a movement like a
   great shining mountain, and yet also like a human figure; and I saw
   something rise out of the midst of this figure towards its mouth and go
   forth from it like a shining brightness. Then I saw this brightness
   standing separate before the Face of God, turning and shaping itself--
   or rather being shaped, for I saw that while this brightness took human
   form, yet it was by the Will of God that it received a form so
   unspeakably beautiful. I saw, too, that God showed the beauty of this
   soul to the angels, and that they had unspeakable joy in its beauty. I
   am unable to describe in words all that I saw and understood.

   When seventeen weeks and five days after the conception of the Blessed
   Virgin had gone by (that is to say, five days before Anna's pregnancy
   was half accomplished), I saw the Blessed Virgin's holy mother lying
   asleep in her bed in her house near Nazareth. Then there came a shining
   light above her, and a ray from this light fell upon the middle of her
   side, and the light passed into her in the shape of a little shining
   human figure. In the same instant I saw the Blessed Virgin's holy
   mother raise herself on her couch surrounded by light. She was in
   ecstasy, and had a vision of her womb opening like a tabernacle to
   enclose a shining little virgin from whom man's whole salvation was to
   spring. I saw that this was the instant in which for the first time the
   child moved within her. Anna then rose from her couch, dressed herself,
   and announced her joy to the holy Joachim. They both thanked God, and I
   saw them praying under the tree in the garden where the angel had
   comforted Anna. It was made known to me that the Blessed Virgin's soul
   was united to her body five days earlier than with other children, and
   that her birth was twelve days earlier.

  4.2 MARY'S BIRTH.

   Several days before the Blessed Virgin's birth Anna had told Joachim
   that the time was approaching for her to be delivered. She sent
   messengers to Sephoris, where her younger sister Maraha lived; to the
   widow Enue (sister of Elizabeth) in the valley of Zabulon; and to her
   niece Mary Salome at Bethsaida, asking these three women to come to
   her. I saw them on their journeys. The widow Enue had a serving lad
   with her; the other two women were accompanied by their husbands who,
   however, went back on approaching Nazareth. I saw that on the day
   before Anna was delivered Joachim sent his many menservants out to the
   herds, and among Anna's new maidservants he kept in the house only
   those who were needed. He, too, went out into his nearest pasture. I
   saw that Anna's firstborn daughter, Mary Heli, looked after the house.
   She was then about nineteen years old and was married to Cleophas, one
   of Joachim's chief shepherds, by whom she had a little daughter, Mary
   Cleophas, now about four years old. After praying, Joachim chose out
   his finest lambs, kids, and cattle, sending shepherds to take them to
   the Temple as a thank-offering. He did not return home until nightfall.

   I saw the three cousins arriving at Anna's house in the evening. They
   went to her in her room behind the hearth and embraced her. After Anna
   had told them that the time was near for her to be delivered, they
   stood up and sang a hymn together: Praise the Lord God; He has shown
   mercy to His people, and has redeemed Israel, and has fulfilled the
   promise which He gave to Adam in Paradise that the seed of the woman
   should crush the head of the serpent,' and so on. I can no longer
   recite it all by heart. Anna prayed as though in ecstasy. She
   introduced into the hymn all the prophetic symbols of Mary. She said:
   The seed given by God to Abraham has ripened in me.' She spoke of the
   promise to Sarah of Isaac's birth and said: The blossoming of Aaron's
   rod is perfected in me.' At that moment I saw her as though suffused
   with light; I saw the room full of radiance, and Jacob's ladder
   appearing above it. The women were overcome with astonishment and joy,
   and I think that they also saw the vision. When the prayer of welcome
   was over, the travelers were refreshed with a slight meal of bread and
   fruit, and water mixed with balsam. They ate and drank standing up, and
   then lay down till midnight to rest from their journey. Anna did not go
   to bed, but prayed, and at midnight woke the other women to pray with
   her. They followed her to her praying-place behind a curtain.

   Anna opened the doors of a little cupboard in the wall which contained
   a casket with holy objects. On each side were lights--perhaps lamps,
   but I am not sure. They had to be pushed up in their holders, and then
   little bits of shavings put underneath to prevent them from sinking
   down. After this the lights were lit. There was a cushioned stool at
   the foot of this sort of little altar. The casket contained some of
   Sarah's hair (Anna had a great veneration for her), some of Joseph's
   bones (brought by Moses from Egypt), and something belonging to Tobias,
   I think a relic of his clothing; also the little shining, white,
   pear-shaped goblet from which Abraham had drunk when blessed by the
   angel. (This had been given to Joachim from the Ark of the Covenant
   when he was blessed in the Temple. I now know that this blessing took
   the form of wine and bread and was a strengthening and sacramental
   food.)

   Anna knelt before the little cupboard with one of the women on each
   side and the third behind her. She recited another hymn; I think it
   mentioned the burning bush of Moses. Then I saw the room filled with
   supernatural light which became more intense as it wove itself round
   Anna. The women sank to the ground as though stunned. The light round
   Anna took the exact form of the burning bush of Moses on Horeb, and I
   could no longer see her. The whole flame streamed inwards; and then I
   suddenly saw that Anna received the shining child Mary in her hands,
   wrapped her in her mantle, pressed her to her heart, and laid her naked
   on the stool in front of the holy relics, still continuing her prayer.
   Then I heard the child cry, and saw that Anna brought out wrappings
   from under the great veil which enveloped her. She wrapped the child
   first in gray and then in red swaddling bands up to her arms; her
   breast, arms, and head were bare. The appearance of the burning bush
   around Anna had now vanished.

   The women stood up and received the newborn child in their arms with
   great astonishment. They shed tears of joy. They all joined in a hymn
   of praise, and Anna lifted her child up on high as though making an
   offering. I saw at that moment the room full of light, and beheld
   several angels singing Gloria and Alleluia. I heard all their words.
   They announced that on the twentieth day the child was to be called
   Mary.

   Anna now went into her bedroom and lay down on her couch. The women in
   the meantime unwrapped the child, bathed it, and wrapped it up again,
   and then laid it beside its mother. There was a little woven wicker
   basket which could be fastened beside the bed or against the wall or at
   the foot of the bed, whichever was wanted, so that the child could
   always have its place near its mother and yet separate.

   The women now called Joachim, the father. He came to Anna's couch and
   knelt down weeping, his tears falling on the child; then he lifted it
   up in his arms and uttered his song of praise, like Zechariah at John's
   birth. He spoke in this hymn of the holy seed, implanted by God in
   Abraham, which had continued amongst God's people by means of the
   covenant ratified by circumcision, but had now reached its highest
   blossoming in this child and was, in the flesh, completed. I also heard
   how this song of praise declared that now was fulfilled the word of the
   prophet: There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse.' He
   said, too, in great humility and devoutness, that he would now gladly
   die.

   It was only then that I noticed that Mary Heli, Anna's elder daughter,
   did not have sight of the child until later. Although she had become
   the mother of Mary Cleophas several years before, she was not present
   at the Blessed Virgin's birth--perhaps because, according to Jewish
   rules, it was not considered seemly for a daughter to be with her
   mother at such a time.

   Next morning I saw the serving men and maids and many people from
   nearby gathered round the house. They were allowed to enter in groups,
   and the child was shown by the women to them all. Many were greatly
   moved, and some led better lives thereafter. The neighbors had come
   because they had seen in the night a glowing light above the house, and
   because the birth of Anna's child after long unfruitfulness was looked
   upon as a great favor from heaven.

  4.3 JOY AT MARY'S BIRTH IN HEAVEN.

   In the moment when the newborn child lay in the arms of her holy mother
   Anna, I saw that at the same time the child was presented in heaven in
   the sight of the Most Holy Trinity, and greeted with unspeakable joy by
   all the heavenly host. Then I understood, that there was made known to
   her in a supernatural manner her whole future with all her joys and
   sorrows. Mary was taught infinite mysteries, and yet was and remained a
   child. This knowledge of hers we cannot understand, because our
   knowledge grows on the tree of good and evil. She knew everything in
   the same way as a child knows its mother's breast and that it is to
   drink from it. As the vision faded in which I saw the child Mary being
   thus taught in heaven through grace, I heard her weep for the first
   time.

   I often see pictures like this, but for me they are inexpressible and
   probably for most people not quite comprehensible; therefore I do not
   relate them.

  4.4 THE PROCLAIMING OF MARY'S BIRTH IN LIMBO.

   In the moment of Mary's birth I saw the tidings brought to the
   patriarchs in limbo. I saw them all, especially Adam and Eve, filled
   with inexpressible joy at the fulfillment of the promise given in
   Paradise. I also perceived that the patriarchs advanced in their state
   of grace, that the place of their sojourn became brighter and more
   spacious, and that it was given to them to have more influence on
   earth. It was as if all their labor and penance, all the struggling,
   crying and yearning of their lives had matured into its destined fruit.

  4.5 AGITATION IN NATURE AND MANKIND AT MARY'S BIRTH.

   At the time of Mary's birth I saw a great and joyful agitation in
   nature, in the animal world, in the hearts of all good men, and I heard
   the sound of sweet singing. Sinners, however, were overwhelmed by fear
   and sorrow. I saw, specially near Nazareth, but also in the rest of the
   Promised Land, many who were possessed break out at that time into
   violent ravings. They were hurled from side to side with loud cries,
   and the devils shrieked from within them, We must surrender, we must go
   out!'

   In Jerusalem I saw how the aged priest Simeon, who lived in the Temple,
   was startled at the moment of Mary's birth by loud shrieks coming from
   the madmen and those possessed of the devil, of whom many were shut up
   in a building in one of the streets on the Temple Hill. Simeon lived
   near them and was partly responsible for looking after them. About
   midnight I saw him go to the open space before the house of those
   possessed and inquire of one of them who lived nearest as to the cause
   of the loud cries with which everyone had been roused from their sleep.
   The man cried still louder that he must go out. Simeon opened the door;
   the possessed one rushed out, and Satan cried from within him: I must
   go out. We must all go out! A virgin has been born! There are so many
   angels on earth who torment us! We must now go out and may nevermore
   enter into men!' I saw Simeon praying fervently; the wretched man was
   flung back and forth on the open space, and I saw the devil go out of
   him. It gave me great pleasure to see the aged Simeon. I also saw the
   prophetess Anna and Noemi wakened and informed by visions of the birth
   of a chosen child. [Noemi was the sister of Lazarus' mother; she was in
   the Temple and later became Mary's teacher.] They met and told each
   other of what they had seen. I think they knew Anna, the Blessed
   Virgin's mother.

  4.6 THE PROCLAIMING OF MARY'S BIRTH IN CHALDEA.

   In the night of Mary's birth I saw in a city of the Chaldeans that five
   sibyls, or virgin prophetesses, were granted visions. I saw them
   hastening to the priests, who then made known in many places that these
   prophetesses had seen that a virgin had been born and that many gods
   had come down to earth to greet her, while other spirits fled before
   her lamenting. I saw, too, that the picture of a Virgin holding scales
   evenly balanced with corn and grapes, which the watchers of the stars
   had seen since Mary's conception, was no longer visible to them. In the
   hour of Mary's birth it seemed to move out of the star, in which it
   left a gap, and to sink down and away from it in one particular
   direction. They now made and set up in their temple the great idol
   which I saw there in my visions of the life of Jesus; it had some
   connection with the Blessed Virgin. [54]

   Later they set up in their temple another symbolic image of the Blessed
   Virgin, the closed garden. I saw live animals lying in this temple and
   being cared for. I am not sure whether they were dogs. They were fed
   with the flesh of other animals. Within the temple of the three holy
   kings I had till now always seen a wonderful illumination at night. It
   was as if one looked up into a starry sky set with all the
   constellations. They used to make alterations in this artificial sky in
   their temple according to the visions they saw in the heavens. Thus
   after the birth of Mary the illumination which had previously come from
   outside now came from within.

  4.7 EVENTS IN EGYPT DURING MARY'S BIRTH.

   When the Blessed Virgin was born, I saw that image of a winged woman
   with a balance in her hand (bending down over a child in a little ship
   lying in the top of a tree) cast into the sea from its place in the
   temple on an island in a river. I had seen the image placed there long
   ago, before the time of Elijah, in accordance with the forced utterance
   of an idol. The little tree on which lay the child in the ship,
   remained in its place. A church was built there later.

   At the moment of Mary's birth I saw falling from the temple ceiling
   pieces of that winged female figure with three breasts which I had seen
   fixed to the ceiling of a temple when a messenger from Elijah announced
   his master's prophecy of a coming Virgin. The face, the three breasts,
   and the lower part of the body all fell down and were broken to pieces.
   The bushel-shaped crown, the arms with the ears of corn, the upper part
   of the body and the wings did not fall down.

  4.8 VISITS WITH THE NEWBORN BABY MARY.

   On the 9 ^th of September, the day after Mary's birth, I saw in the
   house several other relations from the neighborhood. I heard many names
   but have forgotten them again. I also saw many of Joachim's menservants
   arriving from the more distant pastures. All were shown the newborn
   child, and all were filled with great joy. The meal in the house was
   accompanied by much rejoicing.

   On the 10 ^th and 11 ^th of September I again saw many visiting the
   child Mary. Among them were relations of Joachim's from the valley of
   Zabulon. On these occasions the child was brought into the front part
   of the house in its little cradle and put on a high stand (like a
   sawing bench) to be shown to the people. The child was wrapped in red,
   covered with transparent white stuff, up to its bare arms, and had a
   transparent little veil round its neck. The cradle was covered with red
   and white stuff.

   I saw Mary Cleophas (the two- or three-year old child of Anna's elder
   daughter and of Cleophas) playing with the child Mary and caressing
   her. Mary Cleophas was a fat, sturdy child, and wore a sleeveless white
   dress, with a red hem hung with red buttons like tiny apples. Round her
   bare arms she wore little white wreaths, which seemed to be made of
   feathers, silk, or wool.

  4.9 THE CHILD RECEIVES THE NAME MARY.

   [September 22 ^nd-23 ^rd] Today I saw great preparations for a feast in
   Anna's house. All the furniture was moved aside, and in the front part
   of the house the dividing screens had been taken away to make one large
   hall instead of a number of small rooms. Along each side of this hall I
   saw a long, low table set out for a meal with many things that I had
   not noticed before. Fragile vases with openwork tops like baskets stood
   on the table; they may have been for flowers. On a side-table I saw
   many little white sticks, apparently made of bone, and spoons shaped
   like deep shells, with handles ending in a ring. There were also little
   curved tubes, perhaps for sucking up liquid.

   In the center of the hall, a kind of altar table had been set up,
   covered in red and white. On it lay a little trough-shaped
   basket-cradle, of red and white wickerwork, covered with a sky-blue
   cloth. Beside this altar stood a lectern draped in a cloth on which lay
   parchment prayer scrolls. Five priests from Nazareth stood before the
   altar, one of them wearing grander vestments than the others; Joachim
   stood near them. In the background near the altar were several men and
   women belonging to the families of Anna and Joachim, all in festal
   attire. I remember seeing Anna's sister Maraha from Sephoris, and
   Anna's elder daughter and others. Anna herself, though no longer in
   bed, remained in her room behind the hearth and did not appear at the
   ceremony.

   Enue, Elizabeth's sister, brought out the child Mary, wrapped to the
   arms in red swaddling clothes covered with transparent white stuff, and
   laid her in Joachim's arms. The priests approached the altar where the
   scrolls lay and prayed aloud. Two of them held up the train of the
   principal one. Joachim then laid the child in the hands of the high
   priest, who, lifting her up in offering as he prayed, laid her in the
   cradle on the altar. He then took a pair of scissors which, like our
   snuffers, had a little box at the end to hold what was cut off. With
   this he cut off three little tufts of hair from the child's head (one
   from each side and one from the top) and burnt them in a brazier. Then
   he took a vase of oil and anointed the child's five senses, touching
   with his thumb her ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and breast. He also wrote
   the name Mary on a parchment and laid it on the child's breast. She was
   then returned to Joachim, who gave her to Enue to be taken back to
   Anna. Hymns were sung and after that the meal began, but I saw no more.

5. CAUSE OF THE FEAST OF THE NATIVITY OF MARY.

   [On the evening of September 7 ^th, the vigil of the Feast of Mary's
   Nativity, Catherine Emmerich was unwontedly-- as she said,
   supernaturally--gay, although she felt ill at the same time. She was in
   an unusually lively and confidential mood. She spoke of extraordinary
   joy in all nature because of Mary's approaching birth, and said that
   she felt as if a great joy was awaiting her next day, if only this did
   not turn to sorrow. [55] ] There is such jubilation in nature: I hear
   birds singing, I see lambs and kids frolicking, and where Anna's house
   once stood the doves are flying about in great flocks as if drunk with
   joy. Of the house and its surroundings nothing now remains; it is now a
   wilderness. I saw some pilgrims, holding long staffs and their garments
   girt about them, with cloths wrapped round their heads like caps. They
   are going through this part of the country on their way to Mount
   Carmel. A few hermits from Mount Carmel live here, and the pilgrims
   asked them in amazement what was the meaning of this joy in nature?
   They were told that it was ever thus in that country on the eve of
   Mary's birth, and that it was probably there that Anna's house had
   stood. A pilgrim who had passed that way before had, they said, told
   them that this was first noticed a long time ago by a devout man, and
   that this had led to the celebration of the feast of Mary's Nativity.

   I now saw this institution of the feast myself. [56] Two hundred and
   fifty years after the death of the Blessed Virgin I saw a very devout
   man journeying through the Holy Land in order to seek out and venerate
   all the places connected with the life of Jesus upon earth. I saw that
   this holy man was given guidance from above, and often remained for
   several days in prayer and contemplation at different places, enjoying
   many visions and full of interior delight. He had for many years felt,
   in the night of the 7 ^th to the 8 ^th of September, a great joyfulness
   in nature and heard a lovely singing in the air; and at last, in answer
   to his earnest prayer, he was told by an angel in a dream that this was
   the birthnight of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He received this revelation
   on his journey to Mount Sinai or Horeb. It was told him at the same
   time that in a cave of the Prophet Elijah on that mountain was a
   walled-up chapel in honor of the Mother of the Messiah, and that he was
   to inform the hermits living there of both these things. Thereupon I
   saw him arriving at Mount Sinai. The place where the monastery now
   stands was already at that time inhabited by isolated hermits, and just
   as precipitous on the side facing the valley as it is now, when people
   have to be hoisted up by means of a pulley. I saw now that upon his
   announcement the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin was first
   celebrated here by the hermits on September 8 ^th about A.D. 250, and
   that its celebration spread later to the Universal Church. I saw, too,
   how he and the hermits looked for the cave of Elijah and the chapel in
   honor of the Blessed Virgin. These were, however, very difficult to
   find among the many caves of the Essenes and of other hermits. I saw
   many deserted gardens here and there near these caves, with magnificent
   fruit trees in them. After praying, the devout man was inspired to take
   a Jew with them when they visited these caves, and was told that they
   might recognize as the cave of Elijah the one that he was unable to
   enter. I saw thereupon how they sent an aged Jew into the caves, and
   how he felt himself thrust out of the narrow entrance of one of them,
   however much he tried to force his way in. In this way they recognized
   it as the cave of Elijah. They found in it a second cave, walled-up,
   which they opened; and this was the place where Elijah had prayed in
   veneration of the future mother of the Savior. The big, beautifully
   patterned stones which made the wall were used later for building the
   church. They also found in the cave many holy bones of patriarchs and
   prophets, as well as many woven screens and objects of earlier worship.
   All these were preserved in the church. I saw much of Mount Horeb on
   this occasion, but have forgotten it again. I still remember that the
   place where Moses saw the burning bush is called in the language of the
   place The Shadow of God', and that one may walk on it only with bare
   feet. I also saw a mountain there entirely of red sand, on which,
   however, very fine fruit trees grew.

6. THE EFFECT OF PRAYING ON THE FEAST OF THE NATIVITY OF MARY.

   I saw much of St. Bridget, and was given much knowledge of what had
   been revealed to this saint about Mary's conception and birth. I
   remember that the Blessed Virgin said to her that if women with child
   celebrated the vigil of her Nativity by fasting and by the pious
   recitation of nine Ave Marias in honor of her nine-months' sojourn in
   her Mother's womb; and if they renewed this devotion frequently during
   their pregnancy and the day before they expected their confinement, at
   the same time receiving with devotion the Holy Sacrament, she would
   bring their prayer before God and beg for a happy delivery even in
   difficult and dangerous conditions.

   I myself had today a vision of the Blessed Virgin who came to me and
   told me, among other things, that whoever recited with love and
   devotion on the afternoon of this day nine Ave Marias in honor of her
   nine months' sojourn in her mother's womb and of her birth, continuing
   this devotion for nine days, would give the angels nine flowers each
   day for a bouquet which they would receive in heaven and present to the
   Blessed Trinity, to obtain favor for the suppliant. Later I felt myself
   transported to a height between heaven and earth. The earth lay below,
   dark and troubled; above in heaven I saw the Blessed Virgin before the
   Throne of God, between the choirs of angels and the ordered hosts of
   the saints. I saw, built for her out of devotions and prayers on earth,
   two portals, or thrones of honor, which grew at last into palaces like
   churches, and even into whole cities. It was strange to see how these
   buildings were made entirely of herbs, flowers, and garlands all
   intertwined, their different species expressing the different kinds and
   different merits of the prayers of individual human beings and of whole
   communities. I saw all being taken by angels or saints from the hands
   of the suppliants and being carried up to heaven.

7. THE PURIFICATION OF ST. ANNE.

   Some weeks after Mary's birth I saw Joachim and Anna journeying to the
   Temple with the child to make sacrifice. They presented the child here
   in the Temple in devotion and gratitude to God, who had taken from them
   their long unfruitfulness, just as later the Blessed Virgin according
   to the Law offered and ransomed the Child Jesus in the Temple. [57] The
   day after their arrival they made sacrifice, and already then made a
   vow to dedicate their child completely to the Temple in a few years
   time. Then they traveled back to Nazareth with the child.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [32] The matter of the tunnel is one that has long puzzled students.
   Josephus (Ant., XV, xi, 5) certainly mentions an eastern gate where the
   pure' could enter, and (ib., 7) a tunnel that led from the eastern gate
   into the central enclosure, adding that this was built specially for
   the king (Herod). Then the Mishnah, Middoth, I, 9, mentions a tunnel
   leading under the Temple to a bath-house within the enclosure, where
   ceremonial cleansing could be performed. Whether these refer to the
   same tunnel is uncertain. See further, n. 45, p. 34 . (SB)

   [33] See the Little Chapter in the Vespers of the Office of the Blessed
   Virgin Mary from Ecclus. 24.14. From the beginning, and before the
   world, was I created, and to the world to come I shall not cease to be'
   (Ab initio et ante saecula creata sum et usque ad futura saecula non
   desinam '). Compare also the passage of Holy Writ which has long been
   applied by the Church to Mary: I came out of the mouth of the Most
   High, the first-born before all creatures. I made that in the heavens
   there should rise light that never faileth. . . . My throne is in a
   pillar of cloud' (Ego ex ore Altissimi prodivi primogenita ante omnem
   creaturam, ego feci in coelis, ut orietur lumen indeficiens. Thronus
   meus in columna nubis ' ) ( Ecclus. 24.5 ). (CB)

   [34] In the course of her many visions, some historical and some
   symbolical, from the Old and New Testaments, Catherine Emmerich
   referred to this blessing in many different connections, some of which
   we will here enumerate in their chronological order. This was the same
   blessing by means of which Eve was brought forth from the right side of
   Adam. I saw this blessing withdrawn by God's merciful providence from
   Adam when he was about to acquiesce in sin; but it was restored to
   Abraham by the angel after the institution of circumcision, with the
   promise of Isaac's birth. Abraham handed it on, with solemn sacramental
   ceremony, to his first-born Isaac, from whom it descended to Jacob. It
   was taken away from Jacob by the angel that strove with him and handed
   on to Joseph in Egypt. Finally it was taken by Moses, together with the
   bones of Joseph, in the night before the flight out of Egypt, and
   became the Israelites' sacred treasure in the Ark of the Covenant. We
   had just prepared these disclosures for the press, but with
   considerable doubt and hesitation, when we learnt that the book Zohar
   (ascribed to Simon Bar Jochai in the second century of our era)
   reproduces almost word for word these and other statements of Catherine
   Emmerich about this mystery of the Jewish Covenant. Anyone able to read
   late Chaldean can convince himself of this by referring to the
   following passages: Zohar Par. Tol'doth, pp. 340 and 345 (edit.
   Sulzbach), Bereshith, p. 135, Terumah, pp. 251, etc. (CB) It would seem
   that CB was slightly misled in regard to the Zohar, and it is unlikely
   that he was in a position to examine it himself, since qualified
   Hebraists and Aramaic scholars admit its great difficulty. The Zohar
   does not appear to contain any notably close parallels with statements
   of AC, either about the mystery of the Ark' (p. 16 ), or the holy
   thing' within it (pp. 23 - 24 ), or about the blessing handed down
   through the Patriarchs to Moses (p. 23 and CB's note above). The
   references given by CB above are to the Hebrew (and Aramaic) text
   published at Sulzbach in 1684, and refer to columns in the commentaries
   on Genesis and Exodus. We are adding here the standard modern
   references (to folios of the Mantua edition of 1588), which are also
   inserted in the English translation by Sperling and Simon (London,
   1931-1934). Bereshith (Genesis), col. 135 in Sulzbach (= f. 48b-49a,
   standard), contains no relevant reference; but f. 55b (Sulzbach, col.
   171), commenting on This is the book' ( Gen. 5.1), takes that phrase
   literally and refers it to the story of the book containing sacred
   wisdom, which was given by God through an angel to Adam, and then
   handed down through the patriarchs and finally to Abraham. Toledoth
   (Genesis), col. 340 in Sulzbach (= f. 146a, b, standard), recounts the
   many occasions on which Jacob received a blessing. The next reference,
   to col. 345 (=f. 148a, standard), belongs in fact to the next section
   Wayyese, and discusses the mystical meaning of the stones picked up by
   Jacob in Gen. 28.11. Terumah ( Exodus), col. 251 in Sulzbach (=f. 153b,
   154a, standard), though commenting on the construction of the ark (
   Exod. 25), has no reference to the mystery' or the holy thing'. A
   little earlier, however, f. 145b (Sulzbach, col. 238) has a passing
   reference to the heavenly mystery of the Holy of Holies. It seems
   therefore legitimate to say that the Zohar, interesting though it is in
   itself, throws very little light on the matter in hand. (SB)

   [35] In Catherine Emmerich's visions of the public ministry of Our
   Lord, which she daily recounted in chronological order for three years,
   she saw Our Lord, after the raising of Lazarus (which happened on Oct.
   7th of His third year of teaching), withdraw Himself beyond the Jordan
   in order to escape the persecutions of the Pharisees. From here He
   dismissed the apostles and disciples to their homes, and Himself went
   on with three young men named Eliud, Silas, and Erimenzear. (These were
   descended from the companions of the Three Kings who, when the latter
   went away, had remained behind in the Holy Land and intermarried with
   the families of the shepherds of Bethlehem.) With these Our Lord
   journeyed to the place where the Three Kings were then settled,
   returning afterwards to the Promised Land by way of Egypt. On the first
   day of the January which preceded His death, He re-entered Judea, and
   on the evening of Monday, Jan. 8th, He again met the Apostles at
   Jacob's well, thereafter teaching and healing in Sychar, Ephron, round
   Jericho, in Capharnaum, and in Nazareth. Towards February He came again
   to Bethany and the surrounding country, teaching and healing in
   Bethabara, Ephraim, and round Jericho. From the middle of February till
   His Passion on March 30th. He was in Bethany and Jerusalem by turns.
   The Evangelists are silent about the whole period between the raising
   of Lazarus and Palm Sunday, except for St. John, who says (11.53, 54):
   From that day therefore they devised to put him to death, wherefore
   Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews, but he went into a country
   near the desert, to a city that is called Ephraim. And there he abode
   with his disciples.' Catherine Emmerich mentions the presence of Our
   Lord in Ephraim near Jericho on Jan. 14th, 15th, and 16th, and again
   between Feb. 6th and 12th, without giving the exact date. We must,
   however, return to what gave rise to this note. From Dec. 1st to the
   15th of the third year of His ministry, Catherine Emmerich saw and
   daily described the sojourn of Our Lord and His three companions in a
   town of tents inhabited by the three Holy Kings of Arabia, where they
   had established themselves shortly after their return from Bethlehem.
   Two of these chieftains were still alive. She describes in most
   remarkable detail their way of life and their religious practices and
   the festivities with which they received Jesus. Amongst many other
   things she recounted from Dec. 4th to 6th how these star-worshippers
   brought Our Lord into their temple (which she described as a square
   flattened pyramid surrounded with terraced wooden steps), from the top
   of which they observed the stars and inside which they performed their
   religious ceremonies. They showed Him in it the image of the Child
   Jesus in the crib, which they had made and placed therein immediately
   after their return from Bethlehem; this was made in the exact shape of
   the one they had seen in the star before they set out on their journey
   to Bethlehem. Catherine Emmerich describes it in the following words :
   The whole representation was in gold and surrounded by a star-shaped
   sheet of gold. The golden child lay on a red blanket in a crib like the
   one at Bethlehem; his little hands were crossed on his breast and he
   was wrapped in swaddling-bands from breast to feet. They had even
   included the hay of the crib, it could be seen behind the child's head
   like a little white wreath; I cannot remember what it was made of. They
   showed Jesus this image; they had no other in their temple.' This is
   her description of the image of the crib to which she refers above in
   the text. (CB)

   [36] This is the general tradition about the origins of the Carmelite
   Order. It is briefly recounted in the Breviary Lessons for the Feast of
   Our Lady of Mount Carmel (July 16th), where mention is also made of the
   tradition that the cloud seen by Elijah (3 Kings 18.42-45) is a symbol
   of Our Lady. (SB)

   [37] In the Office for the Immaculate Conception and in other
   liturgical books there occurs the following verse: As a cloud I covered
   all the earth' ( Ecclus. 24.6), which is in complete harmony with this
   prophetic vision of the Mother of God. (CB)

   [38] Epiphanius, in his work on the life of the Prophet, says of
   Jeremiah: This prophet gave the Egyptian priests a sign and told them
   that all their idols would fall in pieces, when a virgin mother should
   set foot in Egypt with her Divine Child. And so it befell. Therefore do
   they to this day adore a Virgin Mother and a Child lying in the crib.
   When King Ptolemy questioned them as to the reason therefore, they
   answered, "This is a secret which we received from our ancestors to
   whom it was announced by a holy prophet, and we await its fulfillment"'
   ( Epiphan., Vol. II, p. 240). The above-mentioned son of the prophet
   sent to Egypt by Elijah cannot, however, be taken to be Jeremiah, for
   the latter lived some three centuries later. (CB) This is presumably
   the Greek Father, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, d. 403, but an examination
   of various editions, old and new, has so far failed to identify the
   passage. The quotation may be linked with Jeremiah' prophecy (43.13) of
   the shattering of the idols of Egypt after his warning to the Jews who
   had assassinated Gedaliah and were preparing to flee to Egypt ( Jer.
   41-43). (SB)

   [39] Since the description of this unfamiliar figure was not clear, an
   archeologist used an antique image of Isis, which appeared appropriate,
   to design Figure 4 without in the least needing to change the
   description. (CB)

   [40] This interpretation, alluded to but not definitely established by
   earlier commentators, is shown by Biblical philology to be perfectly
   correct. (CB) The names Azarias and Ananias both occur in Neh. 3.23,
   where Ananias is in Hebrew Ananyah, which may mean the cloud of the
   Lord', but the much commoner name is Hananyah, the Lord is merciful'.
   Azaryah means the help of the Lord'. (SB)

   [41] Many ancient and modern commentators of the Greek text have
   suggested the following version of the passage in St. Luke (3.23 ): He
   was supposed to be the son of Joseph, but was in truth descended from
   Heli', instead of being as it was supposed the son of Joseph, who was
   of Heli'. The absence of any mention of Mary (whose line of descent is,
   however, given by St. Luke) is explained by the basic principle of the
   Jewish genealogists: The father's race is called a race, the mother's
   race is not called a race' (Talmud Baba Bathra, f. 110). The father of
   Mary was, according to this rule, the first of Our Lord's forebears
   according to the flesh who could be named in His line of descent.
   Christ, who had no earthly father, may be as truly called, according to
   the flesh, the son of Heli as Laban ( Gen. 29.5) could be called the
   son of Nachor, and Zechariah ( Ezra 5.1) could be called the son of
   Iddo, for these were both great-grandchildren. (CB) The emphasis on Our
   Lord's Davidic descent ( Luke 1.32, 69) shows that Our Lady must also
   have been of the Davidic line (see Fr. R. Ginns, OP., in Cath. Comm.,
   1953, 748b). The interpretation proposed by CB requires a fresh
   punctuation of Luke 3.23 (literal translation from the Greek): Jesus
   ... being the son (as it was supposed of Joseph) of Heli.' This
   rendering, though according to Fr. Ginns ( ib., 750g) rejected by the
   majority of scholars', is a tenable reading of the Greek. It involves
   the interpretation of son' as grandson' through the mother, as CB
   explains; and the identification of Heli with Joachim (cf. supra, n.
   29, p. 22 ). The more usual reconciliation of the genealogies in Luke
   and Matthew is by the supposition of a second marriage of Joseph's
   mother. (SB)

   [42] Catherine Emmerich no doubt meant by this the connection between
   the line of David through Nathan and that through Solomon (see p. 32 ).
   In the third generation upwards from Joachim, St. Joseph's grandmother
   (who had married as her first husband Matthan, of the line of Solomon,
   and had by him two sons, one of whom was Jacob, the father of St.
   Joseph) took as her second husband Levi, of the line of Nathan, and had
   by him Matthat, the father of Heli or Joachim. Thus Joachim and Joseph
   were related to each other. It is remarkable that Raymundus Martini, in
   his Pugio fidei (p. 745, ed. Carp), also states that St. Joseph's
   grandmother after the death of Matthan married a second husband, from
   whom Joachim was descended. (CB)

   [43] Related on December 8th, 1819.

   [44] Catherine Emmerich had visions of all the feasts of the Church
   being celebrated by the Church Triumphant, even when they were no
   longer celebrated on earth by the Church Militant. She saw these feasts
   being celebrated in a shining transparent church, the shape of which
   she generally described as octagonal. She saw a mysterious gathering of
   all the saints who were particularly associated with the feast in
   question, sharing in the celebrations. She usually saw this church
   floating in the air; but it is noteworthy that in all the feasts having
   so to speak a blood-relationship with Jesus Christ or with the
   mysteries of His life, she saw this church not floating in the air but
   appearing as the crown of a pillar or of a stern thrusting itself up
   like a flower or fruit growing out of the earth. What, however,
   surprised the writer in particular was that on all feasts of saints who
   had received the stigmata (for instance, St. Francis of Assisi or St.
   Catherine of Siena), she saw the church not floating in the air but on
   the stem growing out of the earth. She never made any reflection on
   this point, probably from humility, though it might well have been
   edifying had she done so. (CB)

   [45] Catherine Emmerich's remarks are here in agreement with the
   accounts of the most ancient Jewish literature. Thus, for instance,
   Mishnah, tract. Tamid, c. 5, and Sotah, c. I. (CB) Mishnah, Tamid, V,
   7, states that the ceremonially unclean were to wait at the eastern
   gate, but the tractate Sotah, I, 5, dealing with adultery, directs that
   the woman be taken to the eastern or Nicanor's gate', where also lepers
   and mothers awaiting purification' were to go. The Golden Gate' was
   probably an eastern gate. An eastern gate is also mentioned in Middoth,
   I, 9, in connection with ceremonial cleansing (see supra, n. 32, p. 24
   ). John 8.2 mentions that Our Lord was teaching in the Temple when He
   spoke with the woman taken in adultery. (SB)

   [46] Mountain of the Prophet' is the name given by Catherine Emmerich
   to a place high above all the mountains of the world to which she was
   taken for the first time on Dec. 10th, 1819, in her ecstatic state of
   dream-journeying, and again several times later. There she saw the
   books of prophetic revelation of all ages and all peoples preserved in
   a tent and examined and superintended by someone who reminded her
   partly of St. John the Evangelist and partly of Elijah--particularly of
   the latter, since she perceived the chariot which had transported that
   prophet from the earth standing here on the heights near the tent and
   overgrown with green plants. This person then told her that he compared
   with a great book lying before him all the books of prophetic knowledge
   that had ever been given (often in a very confused state) or would in
   future be given to mankind; and that much of these he crossed out or
   destroyed in the fire burning at his side. Mankind, he said, was not
   yet capable of receiving these gifts, another must first come, and so
   forth. She saw all this on a green island in a lake of clear water. On
   the island were many towers of different shapes, surrounded by gardens.
   She had the impression that these towers were treasuries and reservoirs
   of the wisdom of different peoples, and that under the island, which
   was full of murmuring streams, lay the source of rivers held to be
   sacred (the Ganges amongst them) whose waters issued forth at the foot
   of the mountain range. The direction in which she was led to this
   mountain of the Prophet was always (taking into account the
   starting-point of her journey) towards the highest part of Central
   Asia. She described places, natural scenery, human beings, animals, and
   plants of the region which she traversed before being carried up
   through a lonely and desolate space, as if through clouds, to the place
   mentioned above. Her detailed description of this place, with all that
   she experienced there, will be set down in its proper place with an
   account of her whole visionary journey. On her return journey she was
   carried down through the region of clouds once more, and then again
   traversed lands rich in luxuriant vegetation and full of animals and
   birds, until she reached the Ganges and saw the religious ceremonies of
   the Indians beside this river. The geographical situation of this place
   and Catherine Emmerich's statement that she had seen everything up
   there overgrown with living green, reminded someone who read her
   account twenty years later of traditions about a place of this kind
   (sometimes with a similar inhabitant) in the religions of several
   Asiatic peoples. The Prophet Elijah is known to the Musulmans (under
   the name of Chiser, i.e. the Green One) as a wonderful half-angelic
   being, who dwells in the north on a mountain known as Kaf, celebrated
   in many religious and poetical writings, and there watches over secrets
   at the source of the river of life. The Indians called their holy
   mountain Meru, while to the Chinese it was Kuen-lun, both connected
   with representations of a state of paradise and both situated on the
   heights of Central Asia, where Catherine Emmerich saw the Mountain of
   the Prophet. The ancient Persians also believed in such a place and
   called it Elbors or Albordsch. According to Isa. 14.13 (I will sit in
   the mountain of the covenant, in the sides of the north '), the
   Babylonians would seem to have held a similar belief. That they, like
   the Persians and Moslems, placed this mountain in the north is
   explained by their geographical position as regards the mountains of
   Central Asia. (CB)

   [47] When the writer copied down the very detailed account of her
   dealings with this Judith and her description of the place, he only
   knew (from the direction taken by her journey) that she was in
   Abyssinia; several years after her death he found in the journeys of
   Bruce and Salt an account of a Jewish settlement on the high mountains
   of Samen in Abyssinia. The ruler of this settlement was always called
   Gideon and, if it was a woman, Judith--the name which Catherine
   Emmerich herself mentioned. (CB) James Bruce, Travels and Adventures in
   Abyssinia. He was one of the first Europeans to go there, and his
   journey was in 1769. Henry Salt, A Voyage to Abyssinia. An account of a
   journey made on behalf of His Majesty's Government in 1809-1810. (SB)

   [48] In this connection it seems remarkable that among the writers of
   the first centuries of the Christian era who reproduce the accusations
   made by the heathens against the Christians, Minutius Felix mentions
   this reproach among others that when the Christians initiated anyone
   into their religion, they laid before him a child completely covered
   with flour, so as to hide the murder which they were about to make him
   commit. He was then obliged to stab the child over and over again with
   a knife. They greedily sucked up the streaming blood, cut the child
   into small pieces and devoured them all. This crime, committed in
   common, was a mutual pledge of silence and secrecy in regard to other
   shameful excesses with which they ended their assemblies. Should the
   origin of this accusation perhaps be sought in the above-mentioned
   sacrifice of children by the star-worshippers, who were among the first
   followers of Christianity? In any case, it may well be supposed that
   ideas of this kind (which, as we see in the case of the Magi, arise
   from superstition and from misinterpretation of messages of salvation)
   may be the hidden cause lying at the root of the murder of Christian
   children by Jews. If this be so, these dark and cruel deeds must be
   added to the many motives for which we have to pity the unfortunate
   people of Israel rather than to despise them; for it conceals a
   distorted longing for the Savior. This constantly recurring phenomenon
   has so far as we know never been thoroughly investigated and elucidated
   in a completely unprejudiced spirit. Of late years it has generally
   been treated (like all historical riddles whose source is obscure) in a
   complacent and condescending manner as being nothing but a fanatical
   accusation. (CB) Minutius Felix, Octavius , IX, 5, and cf. XXX, 1 .
   (SB)

   [49] Just as the sacrifice on Calvary was accomplished by the cruelty
   of ungodly priests and by the bloodthirsty hands of brutal
   executioners, so is the sacrifice of the Mass, even when unworthily
   celebrated, a true sacrifice; but the guilty and unworthy priest who
   celebrates it plays the part not only of the Jewish priests who
   condemned Our Lord but also of the soldiers who crucified Him. (CB)

   [50] On July 5th, 1835, the writer discovered from Cardinal Baronius'
   notes on the Martyrologium Romanum of December 8th that in the Sforza
   Library there is a Codex (No. 65) containing a speech by the Emperor
   Leo, who ascended the throne in 886, about this feast in
   Constantinople. It appears from this speech that the celebration of the
   feast was much anterior to this date. According to Canisius (De
   beatissima virgine Maria, lib. I, c. 7) and Galatinus (De arcanis
   catholicae veritatis, lib. 7, c. 5), the feast is included in the
   Martyrology of St. John Damascene (d. A.D. 749). St. Sabbas, Abbot,
   mentioned by Catherine Emmerich, is known for his devotion to Our Lady.
   He died c. A.D. 500. (CB) The year of the death of St. Sabbas is given
   in Ramsgate's Book of Saints (1947) as A.D. 532. (SB)

   [51] It is remarkable that Catherine Emmerich does not give the name
   (if Anselm) to the abbot who had the vision, since Petrus de Natal in
   Catal. Sanct., lib.1 , c. 42, does so, as the writer discovered in July
   1835. Her account seems to be supported by Baronius in his notes to the
   Roman Martyrology for Dec. 4th, where he states that the announcement
   was made, not to Anselm, but at an earlier date in 1070 in exactly
   similar circumstances to Elsinus or Elpinus, a Benedictine abbot. This
   is said to be stated also in J. Carthagena in his homilies De Arcanis
   Deiparae, tom. 1, lib. 1, hom. 19, on the authority of a letter from
   St. Anselm to the bishops of England. It was this holy Bishop of
   Canterbury who first introduced the feast into England. (CB) Petrus de
   Natalibus' Catalogus Sanctorum was published in Venice in 1506. As the
   subsequent work of Baronius (1586, 1589) shows, AC is right in not
   attributing the event to Anselm. The source of the Helsin legend, a
   letter ascribed to Anselm, is now, however, considered to be spurious,
   though this need not impugn the truth of the legend itself. The Anselm
   mentioned by AC (with no title) is wrongly identified by CB with the
   Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1109). It was his nephew, also called
   Anselm, who introduced the feast into England when he became Abbot of
   Bury, St. Edmund's in 1121, having doubtless become acquainted with the
   feast as observed at the Greek abbey of St. Sabbas in Rome, where he
   was abbot 1109-1121. Cf. Cath. Encyc., art. Immaculate' (Holweck), pp.
   677b-678a. (SB)

   [52] It was introduced in 1245 by the Chapter of the Cathedral of
   Lyons, to which Bernard wrote to oppose it. (CB) The date should read
   1140-1145. The reference is to St. Bernard's letter, To the Canons of
   the Church of Lyons', traditionally numbered 174, and numbered
   chronologically 215 (between 1140 and 1145) by Fr. Bruno Scott-James in
   his recent (1953) translation. (SB)

   [53] The Feast of Tabernacles was celebrated, according to Lev.
   23.34-36, for the seven days 15th to 21st Tisri, with an eighth day of
   festival on the 22nd. The Hebrew lunar months do not correspond exactly
   to our months, and Tisri falls in Sept./Oct. CB quite correctly
   distinguishes the Dedication Feast of Solomon's Temple in the month
   Tisri, celebrated in connection with the Feast of Tabernacles (3 Kings
   8.2-66; 2 Chronicles 7.10), from the Dedication Feast on the 25th
   Kislev, which commemorated the cleansing of the Temple by Judas
   Maccabeus in 164 B.C. ( I Macc.4.52). This feast was also called
   Hanukkah and the Feast of Lights' by Josephus (Ant. XII, vii, 7), and
   Encaenia or Dedication' in the Gospel ( John 10.22). (SB)

   [54] On Dec. 7th of the third year of Our Lord's ministry she saw a
   temple of the Chaldeans about which she related the following: On a
   neighboring hill they had a terraced pyramid with galleries, from which
   they zealously watched the stars. They prophesied from the manner in
   which animals moved and they interpreted dreams. They sacrificed
   animals, but had a horror of the blood and always let it run away into
   the earth. In their religious observances they had holy fire and holy
   water, holy juice from a plant and little holy loaves of bread. Their
   temple, oval in shape, was full of images very delicately wrought in
   metal. They had a strong presentiment about the Mother of God. The
   principal object in the Temple was a three-cornered pillar ending in a
   point. On one side of this was an image with many arms and with
   animals' feet. It held in its hands, among other things, a globe, a
   diadem, a bunch of herbs, and a big ribbed apple held by its stalk. Its
   face was like a sun with rays, it was many-breasted, and represented
   the productive and preservative powers of nature. Its name sounded like
   Miter or Mitras. On the other side of the pillar was the figure of an
   animal with a horn. It was a unicorn, and its name sounded like Asphas
   or Aspax. It was thrusting with its horn against another evil beast
   which was on the third side. This had a head like an owl; it had a
   curved beak, four legs with claws, two wings, and a tail ending like a
   scorpion's. I have forgotten its name; indeed, I find it very difficult
   to remember such outlandish names and often mix them up. I can only say
   that they sounded something like this or that. Over the two fighting
   beasts there was an image standing on the corner of the pillar which
   was intended to represent the mother of all the gods. Its name sounded
   like the Lady Aloa or Aloas. They also called her "corn granary ". A
   cluster of high ears of corn grew out of its body: its head was pressed
   down on to its shoulders and bent forward, for on the nape of its neck
   it bore a vessel containing wine or about to do so. They had a saying:
   "The Corn shall become bread, the grape shall become wine, for the
   refreshment of all mankind." Over this image was a sort of crown, and
   there were two letters on the pillar which looked to me like O and W
   [perhaps Alpha and Omega]. What, however, surprised me most in this
   temple was a little round garden, covered over with gold network and
   standing on a bronze altar. Above it was the picture of a virgin. In
   the middle of this garden was a fountain with several sealed basins one
   above the other, in front of which was a green vine with a beautiful
   red cluster of grapes which hung down into a dark-colored wine-press.
   Its form reminded me vividly of the Holy Cross, but it was a
   wine-press. Above in a hollow trunk was fixed a wide funnel with a bag
   hanging from its spout. Two movable arms, fixed to each side of the
   hollow trunk, were used as levers to press the grapes that were in the
   bag so that the juice ran out of the trunk through openings made in it
   lower down. The little round garden, which was about five to six feet
   in diameter, was full of delicate green shrubs, flowers, fruits and
   little trees which were all, like the vine, very lifelike and had the
   same significance as it.' (See Canticle of Canticles 4.12.) (CB)

   [55] In a vision of the Blessed Virgin she had received the promise
   that on the next day, Sept. 8th (which was also her own birthday), she
   would be granted the favor of sitting up in bed for several weeks,
   leaving the bed and walking about the room several times, which she had
   been unable to do for some ten years. The fulfillment of this promise
   was attended by all the spiritual and bodily sufferings which had been
   announced to her at the time, as will be recounted in its proper place.
   (CB)

   [56] The main feature of the story, the holy man who heard music in the
   air and, on asking what it was, received a revelation about Mary's
   birthday, which then led to its general observance, is found in the
   Legenda Aurea of B. James of Voragine, O.P. (c. 1255) for Sept. 8th.
   The oldest documentary evidence for the feast is from the sixth
   century, and its general acceptance not until the eighth or ninth
   (Cath. Encyc., art. Nativity' (Holweck), p. 712d). (SB)

   [57] See Lev. 12.

         III. THE PRESENTATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN IN THE TEMPLE [58]

1. PREPARATION IN ST. ANNE'S HOUSE.

   [On October 28 ^th, 1821, Catherine Emmerich described in these words
   what she was at that moment seeing in a waking vision:] The child Mary
   will, I think, soon be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem. Already some
   days ago I saw the three-year-old child Mary standing before Anna in a
   room in her house and being instructed in her prayers, as the priests
   were soon to come to examine the child in preparation for her reception
   in the Temple. Today a feast in preparation for this event is taking
   place in Anna's house, and guests are gathering there--relations, men,
   women, and children. There are also three priests, one from Sephoris (a
   nephew of Anna's father), one from Nazareth, and a third from a place
   on a mountain some four hours from Nazareth. The name of this place
   begins with the syllable Ma. [59] These priests have come partly to
   examine the child Mary to see whether she is fitted for dedication to
   the Temple, and partly to give directions about her clothing, which has
   to comply with a prescribed ecclesiastical pattern. There were three
   sets of garments, each consisting of a kind of petticoat, a bodice, and
   a robe of different colors. There were also two wreaths of silk and
   wool, and an arched crown. One of the priests himself cut out some
   pieces of these garments and arranged everything as it should be.

   [A few days later (on November 2 ^nd) Catherine Emmerich continued:]
   Today I saw great festivities in the house of Mary's parents. (I am not
   sure whether this actually happened then or whether it was a repetition
   of an earlier vision, for I had seen something like it before during
   the last three days, but because of much suffering and many
   interruptions it escaped my mind.) The three priests were still there,
   and besides them there were several relations of the family with their
   little daughters; for instance, Mary Heli and her seven-year-old child
   Mary Cleophas, who is much stouter and sturdier than the child Mary.
   Mary is very delicately formed, and has reddish-fair hair, smooth, but
   curly at the ends. She can already read, and all are astonished at the
   wise answers she gives. Maraha, Anna's sister from Sephoris, is also
   there with a little daughter, and so are other relations with their
   little girls.

   The garments, which had been partly cut out by the priests, had now
   been finished by the women. During the ceremony the child was dressed
   in them several times and asked various questions. It was all very
   solemn and serious, and though the old priests sometimes smiled gently
   during the proceedings, they were greatly impressed by Mary's wise
   answers and by her parents' tears of joy. The ceremony took place in a
   square room near the eating room. It was lit by an opening in the roof
   covered with gauze. A red carpet was spread on the floor, and on this
   stood an altar table with a red cloth and a white one over it. Above
   this table was a picture in some sort of embroidery or needlework which
   hung like a curtain in front of a kind of little cupboard containing
   scrolls of writings and prayers. (It was a picture of a man, I think of
   Moses. He was dressed in a flowing praying-mantle like the one he wore
   when he went up the mountain to ask something of God. In the picture he
   was not holding the Tables of the Law in his hand; they were hanging at
   his side or on his arm. Moses was very tall and broad-shouldered. He
   had red hair. His head was very long and pointed, like a sugarloaf, and
   he had a big hooked nose. On his broad forehead he had two
   protuberances like horns, turned inwards towards each other. They were
   not hard like animals' horns, but had soft skin, as it were ribbed or
   streaked, and only projected slightly from the forehead like two small
   lumps, brownish and wrinkled. He already had them as a child, but then
   they were little warts. This gave him a very strange appearance, which
   I never liked because it reminded me involuntarily of pictures of
   Satan. I have several times seen protuberances like these on the
   foreheads of old prophets and of some old hermits. Some of these had
   only one, in the middle of the forehead.) On the altar lay Mary's three
   sets of ceremonial garments as well as many other stuffs presented by
   her relations on the occasion of the child's entry into the Temple.
   There was a sort of little throne raised on steps in front of the
   altar. Joachim and Anna and the other relations were gathered round,
   the women standing at the back and the little girls beside Mary. The
   priests entered barefooted. There were five of them, but only three
   took part in the ceremony in their vestments. One of the priests took
   the garments from the altar, explained their significance, and handed
   them to Anna's sister from Sephoris, who dressed the child in them.
   First of all she put on her a little yellow knitted dress, and over it
   a colored scapulary or bodice decorated at the breast with cords. It
   was put over her head and tied round her. Over this she wore a brownish
   robe with armholes, over which hung pieces of the stuff. This robe was
   open at the neck, but closed from the breast downwards. Mary wore brown
   sandals with thick green soles. Her reddish-fair hair, curling at the
   ends, had been combed smooth, and she wore a wreath of white wool or
   silk ornamented at intervals with striped feathers, of a finger's
   breadth and curving inwards. I know the bird in that country from which
   these feathers come. A big square cloth, ash-gray in color, was then
   thrown over the child's head like a cloak. It could be drawn together
   under the arms, which rested in its folds as in slings. It seemed to be
   a penitential or praying garment or a traveling cloak.

   As Mary stood there in this dress, the priests put to her all manner of
   questions which had to do with the way of life of the virgins of the
   Temple. Among other things they said to her: When your parents
   dedicated you to the Temple, they made a vow on your behalf that you
   should never taste wine, vinegar, grapes, or figs; what will you
   yourself now add to this? You may reflect on this during the meal. Now
   the Jews, and especially the Jewish girls, were very fond of drinking
   vinegar, and so was Mary. After more of such questions, the first set
   of garments was removed and the second put on. First a sky-blue dress,
   then a bodice more ornamented than the first one, a bluish-white robe,
   and a white veil shimmering like silk, with folds at the back of the
   neck like a nun's headdress and fastened round the head by a wreath of
   silk flower buds with little green leaves. Then the priests put a white
   veil over her face, drawn together above so as to cover her head like a
   hood. It was held by three clasps which enabled the veil to be thrown
   back to uncover either a third, a half, or the whole of the face. She
   was instructed in the use of this veil: how it was to be lifted and
   then dropped at meals, and when she had to give answers to questions,
   and so forth. She was also instructed in many other rules of behavior
   during the meal of which the whole party partook in the next room.
   Mary's place at table was between two priests, with another facing her.
   The women and little girls were at one end of the table, separate from
   the men. During the meal the child was examined several times by
   question and answer in the use of the veil. They also said to her: You
   are still allowed to eat any kind of food', and handed her various
   dishes in order to test her power of self-denial. But Mary partook of
   only few dishes and but little of each, and filled her hearers with
   great amazement by the childlike wisdom of her answers. I saw that
   during the meal and during the whole examination there were angels
   beside her, helping and guiding her.

   When the meal was over, all went once more into the other room and
   stood before the altar, where the child was again undressed and then
   clothed in ceremonial garments. [Please refer to Figure 5.] This time
   she wore a violet-blue dress woven with a pattern of yellow flowers;
   over this was a bodice or corset embroidered in different colors ending
   in a point and fastening under the arms, where it gathered and held the
   fullness of the dress. Above this was a violet-blue robe, fuller and
   grander than the other ones, and ending in a short, rounded train. Down
   each side of the front of this robe were embroidered three silver
   stripes with what seemed to be little gold rosebuds strewn between
   them; the robe was fastened across the breast by a band which ran
   through and was held by a clasp on the bodice. The robe was open down
   to the lower edge of the bodice, and formed two pockets at the sides in
   which the arms rested. Below the bodice the robe was fastened with
   buttons or hooks, but showed five stripes of the silver embroidery
   running down to the hem. The hem itself was also embroidered. The back
   of this robe fell in ample folds, projecting beyond the arms on either
   side. Over this was thrown a great gleaming veil shot with colors,
   white and violet-blue. The crown which was now put on her head was a
   broad band of thin metal, wider above than below, its upper edge
   surmounted by points with knobs. Over the top of the crown five metal
   bands met in a central knob. These bands were covered with strands of
   silk, and the outside of the broad metal band was ornamented with
   little silk roses and five pearls or precious stones. The inside of the
   band shone like gold. Mary, dressed in these ceremonial garments, the
   significance of each of which had been explained to her by the priest,
   was led up the steps and placed before the altar. The little girls
   stood beside her. She then declared what she would bind herself to give
   up when in the Temple. She said that she would eat neither meat nor
   fish and would drink no milk, but only a drink made out of the pith of
   a reed and water, such as poor people drink in the Promised Land, like
   rice-water or barley-water with us; sometimes she would put a little
   terebinth juice into the water. This is like a white treacly oil, very
   refreshing but not so delicate as balsam. She gave up all spices, and
   said that she would eat no fruit except a kind of yellow berry that
   grows in clusters. I know it well; in that country it is eaten only by
   children and poor people. She said that she would sleep on the bare
   earth and would rise three times in the night to pray. The other temple
   maidens rose only once.

   Figure 5. Mary in ceremonial garments.

   Mary's parents were deeply moved by her words. Joachim, taking the
   child in his arms, said, weeping: O, my dear child, that is too hard,
   your old father will never see you again if you mean to live so
   austerely.' It was very touching to hear. The priests, however, told
   her that she was to rise only once in the night, like the others, and
   they made the other conditions milder. For example, on great feast days
   she was to eat fish. (There was a great fish market in Jerusalem in the
   lower part of the town supplied with water from the pool of Bethesda.
   Once when it dried up, Herod wanted to make an aqueduct and fountain,
   [60] and to meet the expense by selling sacred vessels and vestments
   from the Temple. This caused a real uproar. The Essenes came from all
   parts of the country to Jerusalem to resist it, for, as I have just
   remembered, it was the Essenes who had charge of the priestly
   vestments.)

   The priests also said to the child Mary: Many of those virgins who are
   accepted by the Temple without payment or outfit are obliged, with the
   consent of their parents, to wash, as soon as they are strong enough,
   the bloodstained garments of the priests and other rough woolen cloths.
   This is hard work and often means bloody hands. But this you need not
   do, seeing that your parents are paying for your sojourn in the
   Temple.' Mary declared at once without hesitation that she would gladly
   undertake this work if she were considered worthy. While these
   questions and answers were being made, the clothing ceremony came to an
   end. During these holy proceedings I often saw Mary appear so tall
   among the priests that she stood high above them, whereby I was given a
   picture of her wisdom and grace. The priests were filled with joyful
   astonishment. At the end of the ceremony I saw Mary being blessed by
   the first among the priests. She stood on a little elevated throne
   between two priests, and the one who blessed her stood facing her, with
   others behind him. The priests prayed from scrolls, answering each
   other, and the first one held his hands over her as he blessed her. At
   this moment I was granted a wonderful insight into the inner being of
   the holy child Mary. I saw her as if transfused with light by the
   priest's blessing, and under her heart in an indescribable glory of
   light I saw the same appearance as I had seen in contemplating the Holy
   of Holies in the Ark of the Covenant. In a shining space shaped like
   Melchizedek's chalice I saw indescribable figures of the blessing in
   the form of light. It was as though corn and wine, flesh and blood,
   were striving to unite with each other. I saw at one and the same time
   how, above this appearance, her heart opened like a temple door; and
   how this mystery, surrounded by a kind of canopy of symbolic jewels,
   passed into her opened heart. It was as though I saw the Ark of the
   Covenant entering the Holy of Holies in the Temple. Thenceforth, the
   highest good then on earth was enshrined in her heart. Then I saw only
   the holy child Mary filled with a glow of burning devotion. I saw her
   as though transfigured and hovering above the ground. During this
   vision I perceived that one of the priests (I think it was Zechariah)
   had been inspired with an inner conviction that Mary was the chosen
   vessel of the mystery of salvation; for I saw him receive, a ray from
   the blessing which in my vision had entered into her.

   The priests now led the child, blessed and arrayed in her finest
   ceremonial garments, up to her parents, who were much moved. Anna
   lifted Mary up to her breast and gave her an affectionate but solemn
   kiss. Joachim, with deep emotion, gave her his hand seriously and
   reverently. Mary's elder sister embraced the blessed child in her
   beautiful dress in a much more lively manner than Anna, who did
   everything with reflection and moderation. Mary Cleophas, Mary's niece,
   threw her arms joyfully round her neck like any child. After Mary had
   been saluted by all present, her ceremonial garments were taken off,
   and she appeared once more in her ordinary ones. Towards evening
   several of the guests, including some of the priests, went away to
   their homes. I saw them standing up to take a light meal; there were
   fruits and rolls of bread in bowls and dishes on a low table. They all
   drank out of one goblet. The women ate separately.

2. THE DEPARTURE OF THE CHILD MARY FOR THE TEMPLE.

   I came into the house of Mary's parents at nighttime, and saw several
   of their relations asleep there. The family themselves were busy with
   preparations for departure. The hanging lamp with many branches was
   burning before the hearth. Little by little I saw the whole house
   astir.

   Joachim had sent menservants the morning before to the Temple with
   beasts for sacrifice; five of each kind, the best he had. They made a
   very fine herd. I saw him now busy loading the luggage on a pack animal
   standing before the house. Mary's clothes were neatly arranged in
   separate packages and tied onto the animal, together with presents for
   the priests. It made quite a heavy load. A broad package was arranged
   to make a comfortable seat in the middle of the animal's back. Anna and
   the other women had packed everything in bundles which were easy to
   load. I also saw several kinds of baskets hanging at the donkey's
   sides. In one of these baskets, rounded like the tureens that rich
   people have for their soup, with a lid opening in the middle, there
   were birds of the size of partridges. Other baskets, like the ones used
   for carrying grapes, contained different kinds of fruit. When the
   loading was quite finished, a big cover with heavy hanging tassels was
   put over everything. In the house I saw all the stir and agitation of
   departure. I saw a young woman, Mary's elder sister, moving about with
   a lamp. I saw her daughter Mary Cleophas following her about most of
   the time. I noticed yet another woman whom I took to be a maidservant.
   I also now saw two priests there. One was a very old man wearing a hood
   which hung down in a point on his forehead and had flaps over his ears.
   His upper garment was shorter than the under one and had straps like a
   stole hanging on it. It was he who had taken the chief part in Mary's
   examination yesterday and blessed her. I saw him continuing to talk to
   the child and teaching her different things. Mary was a little more
   than three years old, very delicately and finely made, and was as
   developed as a child of five with us. She had reddish-fair hair,
   smooth, but curly at the ends; it was longer than the seven-year old
   Mary Cleophas' fair hair, which was short and curly. Most of the
   children and grown-up people wore long robes of brownish undyed wool.

   I was particularly struck by two boys among this company who did not
   seem to belong to the family at all and held no converse with any of
   them. It seemed as if no one even saw them, though they spoke to me,
   and were very charming and attractive with their fair curly hair. They
   had books which seemed to be for learning from. (Little Mary had no
   book, though she could read already.) Their books were not like ours,
   but strips some two feet wide rolled round a stick with a projecting
   knob at each end. The taller of the two boys opened his scroll and came
   up to me, and read something out of it which he explained to me. The
   golden letters, each one of which stood alone, were quite strange to
   me; they were written the wrong way round, and each letter seemed to
   signify a whole word. The language was completely strange to my ears,
   yet I understood it. Unfortunately I have now forgotten what he
   explained to me, but I think it had to do with Moses; perhaps it will
   come back to me. The younger of the boys held his scroll in his hands
   as if it were a toy; he jumped about like a child and played with his
   scroll, swinging it in the air. I cannot at all express how much I was
   attracted by these children; they were different from all the people
   there, who seemed not to notice them at all.

   [Catherine Emmerich spoke for a long time with childlike delight of
   these two boys but could not clearly say who they really were. After,
   however, having eaten and then slept for a few minutes, she recollected
   herself and said:] It was the spiritual meaning of these boys that I
   saw; their presence there was not a natural one. They were only the
   symbolic representations of prophets. The taller of the two, the one
   who carried his scroll so solemnly, showed me in it the passage in the
   third chapter of the book of Exodus where Moses sees the Lord in the
   burning bush and is told to put off his shoes from his feet. He
   explained this to me; as the bush was on fire without being burnt, so
   now the fire of the Holy Spirit was burning in the child Mary, who, all
   unconscious of it, was bearing this holy flame within her. [61] This
   passage also, he said, foreshadowed the union, now approaching, of the
   Godhead with humanity. The fire signified God, the thorn bush mankind.
   The boy also explained to me the meaning of the putting off of the
   shoes, but I have no clear recollection of what he said; I think it
   signified the removal of the outer covering to disclose the reality
   within; and foreshadowed the fulfillment of the law and the coming of
   One greater than Moses and the prophets. The other boy carried his
   scroll at the end of a thin stick, blowing in the wind like a flag;
   this signified the joyous entry of Mary on the path which was leading
   her to her destiny as the Mother of the Redeemer. The childish behavior
   of this boy as he played with his scroll showed how Mary, though
   overshadowed by so great a Promise and called to so holy a destiny,
   kept all the innocent playfulness of a child. Actually these boys
   explained to me seven passages out of their scrolls, but in the
   interruptions and troubles of daily life I have forgotten everything
   except what I have now told. O my God [she here exclaimed], all that I
   see is so beautiful and so deep, so simple and so clear, and yet I
   cannot tell it properly and cannot help forgetting so much because of
   the miserable, detestable happenings of this wretched earthly life.
   [62]

   [A year earlier, in the middle of November 1820, Catherine Emmerich,
   while communicating her visions of the Presentation, referred to the
   appearance of these boy-prophets in the following connection. On the
   evening of November 16 ^th a penitential girdle was brought near
   Catherine Emmerich when she was asleep. It had been made by a man who
   was striving to mortify himself but was without any spiritual advice or
   direction. He had made it with much exaggerated austerity out of
   leather straps pierced with nails, but he had been able to wear it for
   hardly an hour. Though it was two feet away from her, the sleeping
   Catherine Emmerich quickly drew her hands away from this girdle,
   saying:] O that is quite impossible and senseless! I, too, once wore a
   girdle like this for a long time, in accordance with an inner warning.
   It was a means of mortification and self-conquest, but was made of
   quite short spikes of brass wire set close together. This is a really
   murderous girdle; the man has taken great pains in making it, but could
   only wear it for a few minutes. One should never do anything like this
   without the approval of a wise director of souls: he did not know that,
   of course, because he had no director at hand. Such exaggeration does
   more harm than good!

   [Next morning she recounted the visions of the night in the form of a
   dream-journey. She said, among other things:]

   Hereupon I came to Jerusalem, at what period I am not sure, but it was
   in the time of the old Jewish kings. I have forgotten what I saw. Then
   I was made to go towards Nazareth to the house of Anna, the Blessed
   Virgin's holy mother. Before the city of Jerusalem two boys joined me
   who were going the same way: one held a scroll very solemnly in his
   hand, while the younger had tied his scroll to a little stick and was
   merrily playing with it in the wind as if it were a little flag. They
   spoke to me joyfully about the fulfillment of the time in their
   prophecies, for they were figures of prophets. I had with me that man's
   exaggerated penitential girdle which had been brought me, and showed
   it, by I know not what impulse, to the prophet boy who was Elijah. He
   said to me, That is a belt of torture not allowed to be worn. But on
   Mount Carmel I made and wore a girdle and have bequeathed it to all the
   children of my order, the Carmelites. That man should wear this girdle,
   it will profit him far more'. Thereupon he showed me a girdle of a
   hand's breadth on which all kinds of letters and lines were inscribed,
   signifying various conquests and struggles, and he indicated various
   parts of it, saying, That man could wear this for eight days and this
   for one day', and so on. O, how I wish the good man could know that!

   When we came near to Anna's house and I wanted to go in, I could not do
   so, and my leader, my guardian angel, said to me: You must first of all
   lay much aside, you must be nine years old.' I did not know how this
   was to be done, but he helped me, I cannot remember how. Three years of
   my life had to disappear altogether, those three years when I was so
   vain about my clothes and always wanted to be a smart young girl. Well,
   I was suddenly nine years old, and now I was able to go into the house
   with the prophet boys. As I did so, the three-year-old child Mary came
   up to me and measured herself against me; she was just the same height
   as me when she stood up by me. How kind and friendly she was, and at
   the same time so serious!

3. BEGINNING THE JOURNEY.

   Immediately after I was standing in the house beside the boy-prophets.
   Nobody seemed to notice us, and we got in nobody's way. Though they had
   been old men hundreds of years ago, they were not at all surprised at
   being present there as young boys: and I, though a nun over forty years
   old, was not at all surprised either at being now a poor peasant child
   of nine years. When one is with these holy people, one is surprised at
   nothing, except at the blindness and sinfulness of mankind.

   I saw the travelers starting on their journey to Jerusalem at daybreak.
   The child Mary came running out of the house to the pack animals, so
   eager was she to go to the Temple. The boy-prophets and I stood at the
   door following her with our eyes. They again showed me passages in
   their scrolls, one of which spoke of the glory of the Temple, but added
   that even greater glory was contained within it. The travelers had two
   pack animals with them. One of the donkeys which was heavily loaded was
   led by a servant and was always a little ahead of the party. On the
   other donkey, which stood loaded before the house, a seat had been
   prepared, and Mary was placed on this. She wore the little yellow dress
   from the first set of garments, and was wrapped in the big cloak, which
   was drawn round her so that her arms rested in its folds. Joachim, who
   led this donkey, carried a tall staff like a pilgrim's with a big round
   knob at the top. Anna walked a short way ahead with little Mary
   Cleophas. A maidservant accompanied them on the whole journey, and some
   of the women and children went part of the way with them. They were
   relations, and turned off to their homes where the roads parted. One of
   the priests also accompanied the party for a little time.

   They had a light with them, but it disappeared completely in the light
   which in my visions of night journeys always illuminates the road about
   the Holy Family and other holy persons, though they themselves never
   seem to see it. At first it seemed to me that I was walking with the
   boy-prophets behind the child Mary, and afterwards, when she was on
   foot, at her side. I sometimes heard the boys singing the 44 ^th Psalm
   (Eructavit cor meum verbum bonum) and the 49 ^th (Deus deorum Dominus
   locutus est), and they told me that these psalms would be sung by two
   choirs at the reception of the child in the Temple, as I should see
   when they arrived.

   I saw the road going downhill at first and later rising again. When it
   was morning and full day, I saw the travelers resting beside a spring
   from which ran a brook; there was a meadow there, and they rested
   beside a hedge of balsam shrubs. These shrubs always had stone basins
   under them to catch the balsam that dripped from them, thus providing
   the passers-by with a refreshing drink, with which they could also fill
   their jugs. In the hedges there were berries which they picked and ate.
   They also had little rolls of bread to eat. The boy-prophets had by now
   disappeared. One of them was Elijah; I think the other was Moses. I am
   sure that the child Mary saw them, but she said nothing about it. She
   saw them just as, when one is a child, one often sees holy children
   appearing to one (or when one is grown-up, one sees holy virgins or
   youths) without saying anything of it to others, because in such
   moments one is in a state of quiet contemplation.

   Later I saw the travelers stop at a house standing by itself, where
   they were made welcome and were given food. The people who lived there
   seemed to be relations. Little Mary Cleophas was sent back from here.
   During the day I had several glimpses of their journey, a rather
   difficult one. They had to pass over hill and dale, and in the valleys
   there were often cold mists and much dew, though here and there I saw
   sunny patches where flowers were showing. Before reaching their resting
   place for the night they crossed a little stream. They spent the night
   at an inn at the foot of a hill on which there is a town. Unfortunately
   I can no longer say for certain what was the name of this place. I saw
   it on other journeys of the Holy Family, and can easily be mistaken
   about its name. [63] I can only say this much, but not with certainty;
   they traveled in the same direction that Jesus followed in the
   September of His thirtieth year, when He went from Nazareth to Bethany
   and thence to be baptized by John. The Holy Family took the same way on
   their flight from Nazareth to Egypt. On that flight their first shelter
   was at Nazara, a small place between Massaloth and a hill town, but
   nearer the latter. I see so many places around me and hear so many
   names that I may very easily mix them up. This town stretches up the
   hillside and is divided into several different parts, though all
   belonging to each other. There is a great lack of water there, and it
   has to be drawn up from below with ropes. There are several old towers
   in ruins, and on the top of the hill is a sort of watchtower with a
   structure of beams and ropes for hauling things up from the town below.
   The many ropes make it look rather like the masts of a ship. It must be
   an hour's climb to the top of the hill. (The travelers stopped at an
   inn down below.) There is a very extensive view from this hill. Part of
   this town is inhabited by heathen people who were treated by the Jews
   as slaves and forced to do hard labor; for instance, they were made to
   work at the Temple and other buildings.

   [On November 4 ^th, 1821, she said:] This evening I saw Joachim and
   Anna with the child Mary and a maidservant arrive at an inn twelve
   hours distant from Jerusalem. They were accompanied by a manservant who
   often went ahead with the heavily loaded donkey. Here they caught up
   with the herd of their beasts on the way to the Temple to be
   sacrificed; these, however, continued at once on their road. Joachim
   must have been very well known here, for he was as if in his own house.
   His beasts for sacrifice always used to stop here. He also came here
   when he returned to Nazareth from his hidden life among the shepherds.
   I saw the child Mary asleep here beside her mother. (I have had so much
   to do these days with the Holy Souls that I think it has made me forget
   part of the journey to the Temple.)

   [On November 5 ^th, 1821, she related:] This evening I saw the child
   Mary with her parents arrive in a town to the northwest of Jerusalem,
   barely six hours' journey from it. This town is called Bethoron and
   lies at the foot of a hill. On the way they crossed a stream flowing
   westwards into the sea near Joppa, where Peter taught after the coming
   of the Holy Ghost. Great battles were once fought near Bethoron. I saw
   them, but have forgotten them again. [64] (See Joshua 10.11) It was
   about two hours' journey from here to a place on a high road from where
   one could see Jerusalem. I heard the name of this road or place, but
   cannot distinctly recall it. [65]

   Bethoron is a large town, inhabited by Levites. Very fine, big grapes
   grow here, and many other fruits as well. The Holy Family stayed with
   friends in a well-kept house. The man was a schoolteacher; it was a
   Levite school, and there were a number of children in the house. I was
   much surprised to see here several women related to Anna, with their
   little daughters, who were, I had thought, on the way to their own
   homes. However, as I now saw, they had taken a shorter road and had
   arrived here first, I suppose in order to welcome the travelers. These
   women and children were from Nazareth, Sephoris, Zabulon, and
   thereabouts; some of them had already been in Anna's house during the
   examination; for instance, Mary's elder sister and her little daughter
   Mary Cleophas, and Anna's sister from Sephoris with her daughters. The
   stay here was made the occasion of great rejoicing over the child Mary.
   She was led into a big room accompanied by the other children, and was
   placed on a raised seat with a canopy, arranged for her like a little
   throne. The schoolteacher and others again asked her all manner of
   questions, putting wreaths on her head. All were astonished by the
   wisdom of her answers. I also heard about the cleverness of another
   girl who had passed through here a short time ago on her way home from
   the Temple school. Her name was Susanna, and later she followed Jesus
   with the holy women. It was her place that Mary was to take in the
   Temple, for there was a limited number of such places. Susanna was
   fifteen years old when she left the Temple, and thus about eleven years
   older than Mary. Anna, too, had been educated in the Temple, but did
   not go there till she was five years old. The child Mary was
   exceedingly joyful at being so near the Temple; I saw Joachim pressing
   her to his heart in tears, and saying: O my child, I fear I shall not
   see you again.'

   A meal was now prepared, and while all were reclining at table I saw
   Mary running about full of loving gaiety, some times nestling against
   her mother or standing behind her and throwing her little arms round
   her neck.

   [On November 6 ^th, 1821:] Today very early I saw the travelers leaving
   Bethoron for Jerusalem. All their relations, the children, and the
   people of the inn went with them. They took with them presents of
   clothing and fruit for the child. It looks to me as if there were going
   to be great festivities in Jerusalem. I learnt for certain that Mary
   was three years and three months old, but she was like a little girl of
   five or six in our country. Their journey did not take them through
   either Ussen Scheera or Gophna, though they were known in those places;
   but they must have passed near them.

4. ARRIVAL IN JERUSALEM.

   [In the evening of November 6 ^th, 1821, Catherine Emmerich said:]
   Today at midday I saw the arrival in Jerusalem of the child Mary with
   those accompanying her. Jerusalem is a strange city; one must not
   picture it with crowded streets like, for instance, Paris. In Jerusalem
   are many valleys, steep ways winding behind city walls. No doors or
   windows are to be seen, for the houses, which stand on high ground,
   face away from the walls New quarters have been added one by one, each
   enclosing a fresh ridge of hill, but leaving the old town walls
   standing between them. These valleys are often spanned by solid stone
   bridges. The living rooms of the houses usually face on to inner
   courts; on the street side only the door is to be seen, or perhaps a
   terrace high up on the top of the wall. The houses are very much shut
   up. Unless the inhabitants have business in the markets or are visiting
   the Temple, they spend most of their time in the inner rooms and
   courtyards. In general the streets of Jerusalem are rather quiet,
   except near the markets and palaces, where crowds of travelers and
   soldiers and people going in and out of the houses fill the streets
   with life and movement. Rome is much more pleasantly situated; its
   streets are not so steep and narrow and are much more lively. When all
   the people of Jerusalem are assembled in the Temple, many of the
   districts of the city seem quite dead. (It was because of the seclusion
   of the inhabitants within their houses and of the number of deserted
   valley paths that Jesus was so often able to go about the city with His
   disciples undisturbed.) Water is scarce in Jerusalem, and one often
   sees great structures of arches with channels to carry it in different
   directions, also towers to the top of which it is driven or pumped. In
   the Temple, where a great deal of water is needed for washing and
   cleansing the vessels, it is used very carefully. It is brought up from
   below by means of large pumping works. There are a great many dealers
   in the city: they usually group themselves with others of the same
   trade, and set up lightly-made huts in open places and markets
   surrounded by porticoes. There are, for instance, not far from the
   Sheep Gate many dealers in every kind of metalwork, gold, and precious
   stones. They have light round huts, brown, as if smeared with pitch or
   resin. Although light, these huts are quite strong; they are used as
   dwellings, and awnings are stretched from one to another under which
   the wares are set out.

   The gentler slope of the hill on which the Temple lies is terraced with
   several streets of houses, built one above the other behind thick
   walls. These are inhabited partly by priests and partly by inferior
   temple servants charged with menial duties, such as cleaning out the
   trenches into which is cast all the refuse from animals slaughtered in
   the Temple. On one side [she means the northern one] [66] the Temple
   hill falls very steeply into a black gully. Little gardens belonging to
   the priests make a green strip round the top of the hill. Work on the
   Temple never ceased: even in Christ's lifetime building was going on in
   different parts of it. There was a quantity of ore in the Temple hill,
   which was dug out in the course of building and made use of. There are
   many vaults and smelting furnaces under the Temple. I never found a
   good place in the Temple to pray in. It is all so extraordinarily
   solid, heavy, and high. And the little courts are themselves so narrow,
   and dark, and so encumbered with seats and other things, that when
   there are great multitudes, the narrow spaces and the crowds between
   the thick high walls and pillars, have a really terrifying effect. The
   perpetual slaughtering and all the blood filled me, too, with horror,
   though all is performed with incredible order and cleanliness. It is a
   long time, I think, since I saw so clearly as I do today all the
   buildings, inside and out; but there is so much to describe that I
   shall never be able to do so properly.

   The travelers, with the child Mary, approached Jerusalem from the
   north, but did not enter it on that side. As soon as they reached the
   outlying gardens and palaces, they skirted the town, turning east
   through part of the valley of Josaphat, leaving the Mount of Olives and
   the road to Bethany on their left, and entered the city by the Sheep
   Gate, which leads to the cattle market. By this gate is a pool, in
   which the sheep destined for sacrifice are washed for the first time to
   remove the heavy dirt. But this is not the Pool of Bethesda. [67] The
   little company soon turned again to the right between walls as though
   going to another quarter of the town. On their way they passed through
   a long valley, on one side of which rose the towering walls of one of
   the upper parts of the city. They went towards the western side of
   Jerusalem, to the neighborhood of the fish market, where the ancestral
   house of Zechariah of Hebron stood. In it was a very old man; I think
   he was a brother of Zechariah's father. Zechariah always stayed here
   when he performed his service at the Temple. He was in the city now;
   his time of service had just come to an end, but he had remained a few
   days longer in Jerusalem on purpose to be present at Mary's reception
   in the Temple. He was not in his house when the company arrived. There
   were yet other relations in the house, from the neighborhood of
   Bethlehem and Hebron, with their children, amongst them two little
   nieces of Elizabeth, who was not there herself. These all went out with
   many young girls, carrying little garlands and branches, to meet the
   travelers, who were still a quarter of an hour away on the valley path.
   They gave them a joyful welcome, and led them to Zechariah's house,
   where great rejoicings took place. They were given some refreshment,
   and then preparations were made to conduct the whole company to a
   ceremonial inn in the neighborhood of the Temple. Joachim's beasts for
   sacrifice had already been brought from near the cattle market to
   stables near this special inn. Zechariah now came to lead the company
   from his house to the inn. The child Mary was dressed in the second set
   of ceremonial garments with the sky-blue dress. A procession was
   formed, headed by Zechariah with Joachim and Anna. Mary followed,
   surrounded by four girls dressed in white, and behind them came the
   other children and relations. They went along several streets, passing
   the palace of Herod and the house where, later, Pilate lived. Their way
   led them towards the northeastern corner of the Temple hill; behind
   them was the fortress Antonia, a big high building on the north-western
   side of the Temple. They had to climb a high wall by a flight of many
   steps. They wanted to take the child Mary by the hand, but to
   everyone's surprise she ran up swiftly and joyfully by herself.

   The house they were going to was a ceremonial inn not far from the
   cattle market. There were four of these inns round the Temple, and this
   one had been hired for them by Zechariah. It was a large building, with
   a big courtyard surrounded by a kind of cloister with sleeping places
   and long, low tables. There was also a large room with a hearth for
   cooking. The place to which Joachim's sacrificial beasts had been taken
   was near by. On each side of it were the dwellings of the Temple
   servants who had charge of the animals for sacrifice.

   When the company entered the inn, their feet were washed, as is the
   custom with new arrivals; the men's feet were washed by men, the
   women's by women. Then they went into a room where a big many-branched
   lamp hung from the middle of the ceiling over a large metal basin with
   handles, full of water, in which they washed their hands and faces.
   Joachim's pack-donkey was unloaded and led by the manservant to the
   stable.

   Joachim, who had given notice of his intention to sacrifice, followed
   the Temple servants to the near-by stables, where they inspected his
   beasts.

   Joachim and Anna then made their way with the child Mary to a priest's
   house higher up the hill. Here, too, the child ran up the steps with
   surprising energy as though upheld and urged by a spiritual force. The
   two priests in this house, one very old and one younger, gave them a
   friendly welcome; both had been present at Mary's examination in
   Nazareth and were expecting her. After they had spoken of the journey
   and of the approaching presentation ceremony, they summoned one of the
   Temple women, an aged widow who was to have charge of the child. (She
   lived near the Temple with other women who, like her, were occupied in
   various feminine employments and in the training of young girls. Their
   dwelling was farther away from the Temple than the rooms in which were
   the oratories of the women and of the maidens dedicated to the Temple.
   These rooms were built directly onto it, and from them one could look
   down unseen into the holy place below.) The woman who now came in was
   so muffled up that only a little of her face could be seen. The child
   Mary was introduced to her as her future foster-child by the priests
   and by her parents. She was grave but friendly, and the child was
   serious, humble, and respectful. They told her of Mary's disposition
   and character, and discussed various matters connected with the
   ceremony of her presentation. This elderly woman accompanied them to
   the inn and was given a package of the child's belongings, which she
   took back with her to arrange in Mary's new home. Those who had
   accompanied the party from Zechariah's house returned there, and only
   the relations who had come with the Holy Family remained in the inn
   hired by Zechariah. The women of the party settled themselves there and
   made preparations for a banquet on the following day.

   [On November 7 ^th Catherine Emmerich said:] I spent the whole of today
   watching the preparations for Joachim's sacrifice and for Mary's
   reception in the Temple. Early in the morning Joachim and some other
   men drove the sacrificial animals to the Temple, where they underwent
   another inspection by the priests; some of them were rejected, and
   these were at once driven to the cattle market in the city. Those which
   were accepted were driven into the slaughtering-place, where I saw many
   things happening, but can no longer say in what order. I remember that
   Joachim laid his hand on the head of each animal before it was
   sacrificed. He had to catch the blood in a vessel, and had also to
   receive certain portions of the animal. There were all kinds of
   pillars, tables, and vessels there, where everything was cut up,
   distributed, and arranged in order. The bloody froth was taken away,
   while the fat, spleen, and liver were set apart. Everything was
   sprinkled with salt. The intestines of the lambs were cleansed and,
   after being filled with something, were put back into the body to make
   it seem whole again. The legs of all the animals were tied together
   crosswise. Some of the meat was taken into another court and given to
   the Temple virgins, who had to do something with it--perhaps to prepare
   it for their own or for the priests' food. All was done with incredible
   orderliness. The priests and Levites moved about always two by two, and
   the most difficult and complicated tasks were accomplished as if by
   clockwork. The pieces of meat were not actually offered up till the
   following day; in the meantime they lay in salt.

   There were great rejoicings in the inn today, and a banquet; there must
   have been a hundred people there, counting the children. There were
   present at least twenty-four girls of varying ages; among them I saw
   Seraphia, who after Jesus' death was known as Veronica. She was tall,
   and might have been ten or twelve years old. They were making wreaths
   and garlands for Mary and her companions, and decorating seven candles
   or torches. The candlesticks, which were without pedestals, were shaped
   like scepters; I cannot remember what fed the flame at the top, whether
   it was oil or wax or something else. During the festivities there were
   several priests and Levites going in and out of the inn, and these also
   took part in the banquet. When they expressed astonishment at the
   greatness of Joachim's sacrifice, he explained that he wished to show
   his gratitude to the best of his power; he could not forget how, by
   God's mercy, his shame in the Temple at the rejection of his sacrifice
   had been followed by the granting of his petitions. Today, too, I saw
   the child Mary going for a walk near the inn with the other little
   girls. Much else I have forgotten.

5. MARY'S ENTRY INTO THE TEMPLE AND PRESENTATION.

   [On November 8 ^th, 1821, Catherine Emmerich related:] Today Joachim
   went first to the Temple with Zechariah and the other men. Afterwards
   Mary was taken there by her mother Anna in a festal procession. First
   came Anna and her elder daughter Mary Heli, with the latter's little
   daughter Mary Cleophas; then the holy child Mary followed in her
   sky-blue dress and robe, with wreaths round her arms and neck; in her
   hand she held a candle or torch entwined with flowers. Decorated
   candles like this were also carried by three maidens who walked on each
   side of her, wearing white dresses embroidered with gold. They, too,
   wore pale-blue robes; they were wreathed round with garlands of
   flowers, and wore little wreaths round their necks and arms as well.
   Next came the other maidens and little girls, all in festal dress but
   each different. They all wore little robes. The other women came at the
   end of the procession. They could not go direct from the inn to the
   Temple, but had to make a detour through several streets. The beautiful
   procession gave pleasure to all who saw it, and at several houses honor
   was paid to it as it passed. There was something indescribably moving
   in the holiness apparent in the child. As the procession approached the
   Temple, I saw many of the Temple servants struggling with great efforts
   to open an immensely large and heavy door, shining like gold and
   ornamented with a multitude of sculptured heads, bunches of grapes, and
   sheaves of corn. This was the Golden Gate. The procession passed under
   this gate, to which fifteen steps led up, but whether in a single
   flight I cannot remember. Mary would not take the hands held out to
   her; to the admiration of all she ran eagerly and joyfully up the steps
   without stumbling. She was received in the gateway by Zechariah,
   Joachim, and several priests, and led under the gate (which was a long
   archway) to the right into some large halls or high rooms, in one of
   which a meal was being prepared. Here the procession dispersed. Several
   of the women and children went to the women's praying-place in the
   Temple, while Joachim and Zechariah proceeded to the sacrifice. In one
   of the halls the priest again examined the child Mary by putting
   questions to her. They were astonished at the wisdom of her answers,
   and left her to be dressed by Anna in the third and most magnificent
   violet-blue ceremonial garment, with the robe, veil, and crown which I
   have already described at the ceremony in Anna's house.

   In the meantime Joachim had gone with the priests to the sacrifice. He
   was given fire from the appointed place, and then stood between two
   priests at the altar. I am at present too ill and upset to describe all
   the circumstances of the sacrifice, but will tell what is still present
   to my mind.

   The altar could be approached from three sides only. The meat prepared
   for the sacrifice was not put all together, but was divided into
   separate portions placed round the altar. Flat shelves could be drawn
   out of the three sides of the altar, and on these the offerings were
   laid to be pushed to the center of it; for the altar was too large for
   the officiating priest to be able to reach the center with his arm. At
   the four corners of the altar there stood little hollow columns of
   metal, crowned with chimneys or something similar--wide funnels made of
   thin copper, ending in pipes curving outwards like horns, which carried
   away the smoke above the heads of the officiating priests. When
   Joachim's sacrifice started to burn, Anna went, with the child Mary in
   her ceremonial dress and with her companions, into the outer court of
   the women, which is the place in the Temple set apart for women. This
   court was separated from the court of the altar of sacrifice by a wall
   surmounted by a grille; there was, however, a door in the center of
   this dividing wall. The women's court slants upwards from the wall, so
   that a view of the altar of sacrifice cannot be had by all, but only by
   those standing at the back. When, however, the door in the dividing
   wall was opened, a number of the women were able to see the altar
   through it. Mary and the other little girls stood in front of Anna, and
   the other women of the family remained near the door. In a separate
   place there were a number of Temple boys dressed in white and playing
   flutes and harps. After the sacrifice, there was set up in the doorway
   leading from the court of sacrifice to the women's court a portable
   decorated altar [68] or sacrificial table, with several steps leading
   up to it.

   Zechariah and Joachim came out of the court of sacrifice and went up to
   this altar with a priest, in front of whom stood another priest and two
   Levites with scrolls and writing materials. Anna led the child Mary up
   to them; the maidens who had accompanied Mary stood a little behind.
   Mary knelt on the steps, and Joachim and Anna laid their hands on her
   head. The priest cut off a few of her hairs and burnt them in a
   brazier. Her parents also said a few words, offering up their child;
   these were written down by two Levites. Meanwhile the maidens sang the
   44 ^th Psalm (Eructavit cor meum verbum bonum) and the priests the 49
   ^th Psalm ( Deus, deorum Dominus, locutus est ) accompanied by the boys
   with their instruments.

   I then saw Mary being led by the hand by two priests up many steps to a
   raised place in the wall dividing the outer court of the Holy Place
   from the other court. They placed the child in a sort of niche in the
   middle of this wall, so that she could see into the Temple, where there
   were many men standing in ranks; they seemed to me to be also dedicated
   to the Temple. Two priests stood beside her, and still others on the
   steps below, singing and reading aloud from their scrolls. On the other
   side of the dividing wall there was an old high priest standing at an
   altar of incense, so high up that one could see half of his figure. I
   saw him offering incense and the smoke from it enveloping the child
   Mary.

   During these ceremonies I saw a symbolic vision round the Blessed
   Virgin which eventually filled and dimmed the whole Temple. I saw a
   glory of light under Mary's heart, and understood that this glory
   encompassed the Promise, the most holy blessing of God. I saw this
   glory appear as if surrounded by the Ark of Noah, so that the Blessed
   Virgin's head projected above it. Then I saw the shape of the Ark about
   the glory change into the shape of the Ark of the Covenant, which in
   its turn changed into the shape of the Temple. Then I saw these shapes
   disappear, and out of the glory there rose before the Blessed Virgin's
   breast a shape like the Chalice of the Last Supper, and above this,
   before her mouth, a bread marked with a cross. On each side of her
   there streamed out manifold rays of light at the ends of which appeared
   in pictures many mysteries and symbols of the Blessed Virgin, as for
   example all the titles in the Litany of the Blessed Virgin. Behind her
   shoulders two branches of olive and cypress or cedar and cypress
   stretched crosswise above a slender palm tree, which I saw appear just
   behind her with a little leafy shrub. In the spaces between this
   arrangement of green branches I saw all the instruments of Jesus'
   Passion. The Holy Ghost hovered over the picture in human rather than
   dove-like form, winged with rays of light: and above I saw the heavens
   open and disclose, floating in the air above the Blessed Virgin, the
   heavenly Jerusalem, the City of God, with all its palaces and gardens
   and the mansions of future saints. All were filled with angels, and the
   whole glory, which now surrounded the Blessed Virgin, was filled with
   angels' faces.

   How can this be expressed? Its variations, its unfoldings, and its
   transformations were so innumerable that I have forgotten a very great
   deal. The whole significance of the Blessed Virgin in the Covenant of
   the Old and New Testaments and to all eternity was set forth therein. I
   can compare this vision with the smaller one which I had a short time
   ago of the holy Rosary in all its glory. (Seemingly clever people who
   speak slightingly of the Rosary are much less sensible than poor
   unimportant folk who pray with it in all simplicity, for these adorn it
   with the beauty of obedience and humble devotion, trusting in the
   Church's recommendation of it to the faithful.)

   With this vision before me, all the splendor and magnificence of the
   Temple and the beautifully decorated wall behind the Blessed Virgin
   seemed quite dim and dingy, even the Temple itself seemed to be no
   longer there, so full was everything of Mary and her glory. As the
   whole significance of the Blessed Virgin unfolded itself before my eyes
   in these visions I saw her no longer as the child Mary, but as the
   Blessed Virgin, hovering tall above me. I saw the priests and the smoke
   of the offering and everything through the picture; it was as if the
   priests behind her were uttering prophecies and admonishing the people
   to thank God and to pray that this child should be magnified. All those
   who were present in the Temple were hushed and filled with solemn awe,
   though they did not see the picture that I saw. It disappeared again
   little by little just as I had seen it come. At last I saw nothing but
   the glory under Mary's heart, with the Blessing of the Promise shining
   within it. Then this disappeared, too, and I saw the holy dedicated
   child in her ceremonial dress standing alone once more between the
   priests. The priests took the wreaths from off the child's arms and the
   torch from her hand and gave them to her companions. They placed a
   brown veil or hood on her head, and led her down the steps through a
   door into another hall, where she was met by six other (but older)
   Temple virgins who strewed flowers before her. Behind her stood her
   teachers: Noemi, the sister of Lazarus' mother, the Prophetess Anna,
   and still a third woman; the priests gave the child Mary over to them
   and withdrew. Her parents and near relations now approached; the
   singing was over, and Mary said farewell. Joachim's emotion was
   particularly deep; he lifted Mary up, pressed her to his heart, and
   said to her with tears, Remember my soul before God!' Thereupon Mary
   with her teachers and several maidens went into the women's dwelling on
   the north side of the Temple itself. They lived in rooms built in the
   thickness of the Temple walls. Passages and winding stairs led up to
   little praying cells near the Holy Place and Holy of Holies.

   Mary's parents and relations went back to the hall by the Golden Gate
   where they had first waited, and partook of a meal there with the
   priests. The women ate in a separate hall. I have forgotten much of
   what I saw and heard, amongst other things the exact reason why the
   ceremony was so rich and solemn; but I do recollect that it was so as a
   result of a revelation of the Divine Will.

   (Mary's parents were really well off; it was only as mortification and
   for almsgiving that they lived so poorly. I forget for how long Anna
   ate nothing but cold food; but their servants were well fed and
   provided for.) I saw many people praying in the Temple, and many had
   followed the procession to its gates. Some of those present must have
   had some idea of the destiny of the Blessed Virgin, for I remember Anna
   speaking with enthusiastic joy to various women and saying to them, Now
   the Ark of the Covenant, the Vessel of the Promise, is entering the
   Temple'. Mary's parents and other relations reached Bethoron the same
   day on their journey home.

   I now saw a festival among the Temple virgins. Mary had to ask the
   teachers and each of the young girls whether they would suffer her to
   be among them. This was the custom. Then they had a meal, and
   afterwards they danced amongst themselves. They stood opposite each
   other in pairs, and danced in various figures and crossings. There was
   no hopping. It was like a minuet. Sometimes there was a swaying,
   circular motion of the body, like the movements of the Jews when they
   pray. Some of the young girls accompanied the dancing with flutes,
   triangles, and bells. There was another instrument which sounded
   particularly strange and delightful. It was played by plucking the
   strings stretched on the steeply sloping sides of a sort of little box.
   In the middle of the box were bellows which when pressed up and down
   sent the air through several pipes, some straight and some crooked, and
   so made an accompaniment to the strings. The instrument was held on the
   player's knees.

   In the evening I saw the teacher Noemi lead the Blessed Virgin to her
   little room, which looked into the Temple. It was not quite square, and
   the walls were inlaid with triangular shapes in different colors. There
   was a stool in it and a little table, and in the corners were stands
   with shelves for putting things on. Before this room was a sleeping
   place and a room for dresses, as well as Noemi's room. Mary spoke to
   her again about rising often to pray in the night, but Noemi did not
   yet allow this.

   The Temple women wore long, full, white robes with girdles and very
   wide sleeves, which they rolled up when working. They were veiled.

   I never remember seeing that Herod entirely rebuilt the Temple: I only
   saw various alterations being made in it during his reign. Now, when
   Mary came to the Temple, eleven years before Christ's birth, nothing
   was being built in the Temple itself, but (as always) in the outer
   portions of it: here the work never stopped.

   [On November 21 ^st Catherine Emmerich said:] Today I had a view of
   Mary's dwelling in the Temple. On the northern side of the Temple hall,
   towards the Holy Place, there were several rooms high up which were
   connected with the women's dwellings. Mary's room was one of the
   outermost of these towards the Holy of Holies. From the passage one
   passed through a curtain into a sort of antechamber, which was divided
   off from the room itself by a partition, semicircular or forming an
   angle. In the corners to the right and left were shelves for keeping
   clothes and other things. Opposite the door in this partition steps led
   to an opening high up in the wall which looked down into the Temple.
   This opening had a carpet hanging before it and was curtained with
   gauze. Against the wall in the left-hand side of the room there was a
   rolled-up carpet, which, when spread out, made the bed on which Mary
   slept. A bracket-lamp was fixed in a niche in the wall, and today I saw
   the child standing on a stool and praying by its light from a parchment
   roll with red knobs. It was a very touching sight. The child was
   wearing a little blue-and-white striped dress woven with yellow
   flowers. There was a low round table in the room. I saw Anna come in
   and place on the table a dish with fruits of the size of beans and a
   little jug. Mary was skilful beyond her years: I saw her already
   working at little white cloths for the service of the Temple.

   [Catherine Emmerich generally communicated the above visions about the
   time of the feast of the Presentation of Mary. Besides these, however,
   she related at different times the following accounts of Mary's
   eleven-year sojourn in the Temple:]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [58] The story of the Presentation of Our Lady in the Temple at the age
   of three years appears in the Apocryphal Gospels: Protev. 7, Ps-Matt.
   6, Nat. Mar. 6, Hist. Jos. 3; and is attested by the liturgical feast
   on Nov. 21st. (SB)

   [59] There is a place called Madin about twelve miles north-east of
   Nazareth on the high ground above the Lake of Galilee. Cf. Jos. 11.1.
   (SB)

   [60] Pilate, not Herod, proposed to make an aqueduct with Temple funds,
   and thereby caused a riot of 10,000 Jews, according to Josephus (Ant.,
   XVIII, iii. 2). (SB)

   [61] For the burning bush ( Ex. 3.2) as a type of Our Lady, cf. the
   second antiphon at Lauds on Jan. 1st. (SB)

   [62] One may well be alarmed by the power of the world over fallen
   mankind when one considers how earthly things brought forgetfulness
   upon this favored soul who was not at all attached to them. Every year
   about this time she saw this picture of Mary's departure for the
   Temple, and each time the appearance of the two prophets as boys was in
   some way interwoven with it. She sees them appear as boys and not at
   their real age, because they were not personally present at the
   proceeding but accompany her only as emblems. Painters, when making
   historical pictures, are in the habit of representing not in their real
   form, but as youths, genii, or angels, those persons who are intended
   to illustrate some truth or other. Thus we may see that this manner of
   representation is not a result of their poetical imagination, but lies
   in the nature of all visionary appearances. (CB)

   [63] From the situation of this town and from the mention of its having
   some heathen inhabitants, and of Jesus having traveled in this
   direction in His thirtieth year on His way to His Baptism, we may
   conclude that it was Endor. For in her daily visions of the ministry of
   Our Lord, Catherine Emmerich saw Him celebrating the Sabbath in a small
   place near Endor in the middle of September of the first year of His
   ministry on His way to His Baptism. Also in this rather deserted
   hill-town she saw Him teaching the Canaanites settled here since the
   defeat of Sisera, in whose army their ancestors had served. (CB) Endor
   lies north-cast of the Plain of Esdrelon, where the battle was fought
   in which Sisera was defeated ( Judges 4). (SB)

   [64] Upper Bethoron is on the hill and Lower Bethoron at the foot of
   the hill. Jos. 10.11 mentions the battle in the descent of Beth-Horon';
   and a big battle took place here as recorded in I Macc. 3.16-24. (SB)

   [65] She remembered that the name sounded like Marion (possibly Marom',
   i.e. the height'). It is known that a road ran from Jerusalem past
   Bethoron to Nicopolis and Lydda. Catherine Emmerich gave all kinds of
   other details about the hills and valleys on the journey up to this
   point, but as she sees more distinctly than she can describe, it is
   impossible to reproduce these details, particularly as the
   topographical position from which she sees them cannot be determined.
   (CB)

   [66] It is the eastern side of the Temple hill that falls steeply into
   the Valley of Kedron. (SB)

   [67] John 5.2, usually rendered, There is at Jerusalem a pond Probatica
   (=sheep), which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida (or Bethesda or Bezatha)',
   seems to identify the sheep-pool and Bethsaida, which AC states are
   distinct. But the most probable rendering of the Greek is There is at
   Jerusalem by the Probatica (i.e. sheep gate) a swimming pool called in
   Hebrew Bezatha', and excavations have revealed traces of a
   swimming-pool with five porches' (John, ib.) (cf. Cath. Comm., 791c).
   This is evidently not the same as the sheep-dipping poo1 mentioned by
   AC. (SB)

   [68] This altar-table was set up in this doorway because women were not
   permitted to go farther. When the meeting of Joachim and Anna took
   place, Joachim had gone through this door into the subterranean
   passage, while Anna had come from the opposite direction. (CB)
     __________________________________________________________________

            IV. THE EARLY LIFE OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN AT THE TEMPLE.

   I saw the Blessed Virgin in the Temple, ever progressing in learning,
   prayer, and work. Sometimes I saw her in the women's dwelling with the
   other young girls, sometimes alone in her little room. She worked,
   wove, and knitted narrow strips of stuff on long rods for the service
   of the Temple. She washed the cloths and cleansed the pots and pans. I
   often saw her in prayer and meditation. I never saw her chastising or
   mortifying her body--she did not need it. Like all very holy people she
   ate only to live, and took no other food except that which she had
   vowed to eat. Besides the prescribed Temple prayers, Mary's devotions
   consisted of an unceasing longing for redemption, a perpetual state of
   inner prayer, quietly and secretly performed. In the stillness of the
   night she rose from her bed and prayed to God. I often saw her weeping
   at her prayers and surrounded by radiance. As she grew up, I always saw
   that she wore a dress of a glistening blue color. She was veiled while
   at prayer, and also wore a veil when she spoke with priests or went
   down to a room by the Temple to be given work or to hand over what she
   had done. There were rooms like this on three sides of the Temple; they
   always looked to me like sacristies. All sorts of things were kept
   there which it was the duty of the Temple maidens to look after,
   repair, and replace.

   I saw the Blessed Virgin living in the Temple in a perpetual ecstasy of
   prayer. Her soul did not seem to be on the earth, and she often
   received consolation and comfort from heaven. She had an endless
   longing for the fulfillment of the Promise, and in her humility hardly
   ventured on the wish to be the lowliest maidservant of the Mother of
   the Redeemer. Mary's teacher and nurse in the Temple was called Noemi,
   she was a sister of Lazarus' mother and was fifty years old. She and
   the other Temple women belonged to the Essenes. Mary learnt from her
   how to knit and helped her when she washed the blood of the sacrifices
   from the vessels and instruments, or when she cut up and prepared
   certain parts of the flesh for the Temple women and priests; for this
   formed part of their food. Later on Mary took a still more active part
   in these duties. When Zechariah did his service in the Temple he used
   to visit her, and Simeon was also acquainted with her.

   The Blessed Virgin's significance cannot have been quite unknown to the
   priests. Her whole being, the abundance of grace in her, and her wisdom
   were so remarkable from her childhood in the Temple onwards that they
   could not be entirely concealed in spite of her great humility. I saw
   aged holy priests filling great scrolls with writing about her, and I
   have been shown these scrolls, lying with other writings, though I
   cannot remember at what period.
     __________________________________________________________________

                        V. THE EARLY LIFE OF ST. JOSEPH

   [We here break off Catherine Emmerich's somewhat disconnected
   description of the Blessed Virgin's sojourn in the Temple to give the
   following accounts of St. Joseph's youth.]

   Among many things which I saw today of the youth of St. Joseph, I
   remember what follows.

   Joseph, whose father was called Jacob, was the third of six brothers.
   His parents lived in a large house outside Bethlehem, once the
   ancestral home of David, whose father Isai or Jesse had owned it. By
   Joseph's time there was, however, little remaining of the old building
   except the main walls. The situation was very airy, and water was
   abundant there. I know my way about there better than in our own little
   village of Flamske.

   In front of the house was an outer court (as in the houses of ancient
   Rome), surrounded by a covered colonnade like a cloister. [Please refer
   to Figure 6.] I saw sculptures in this colonnade like the heads of old
   men. On one side of the court was a fountain under a stone canopy. The
   water issued from animals' heads in stone. There were no windows to be
   seen in the lower story of the dwelling house itself, but high up there
   were circular openings. I saw one door. A broad gallery ran round the
   upper part of the house, with little towers at each of its four
   corners, like short, thick pillars, ending in big balls or domes on
   which little flags were fastened. Stairs led up through these little
   towers from below, and from openings in the domes one had a view all
   round without being seen oneself. There were little towers like this on
   David's palace in Jerusalem, and it was from the dome of one of these
   that he saw Bathsheba at her bath. This gallery ran round a low upper
   story with a flat roof on which was another building with another
   little tower. Joseph and his brothers lived in the upper story, and
   their teacher, an aged Jew, lived in the topmost building. They all
   slept in a circle in one room, in the middle of the story which was
   surrounded by the gallery. Their sleeping places were carpets, rolled
   up against the wall in the daytime and separated by removable screens.
   I have often seen them playing up there in their rooms. They had toys
   in the shape of animals, like little pugs. [Catherine Emmerich uses
   this word indiscriminately for any creatures she does not know.] I also
   saw how their teacher gave them all kinds of strange lessons which I
   did not rightly understand. I saw him making all kinds of figures on
   the ground with sticks, and the boys had to walk on these figures; then
   I saw the boys walking on other figures and pushing the sticks apart,
   placing them differently and rearranging them and making various
   measurements at the same time. I saw their parents, too; they did not
   trouble much about their children and had little to do with them. They
   seemed to me to be neither good nor bad.

   Figure 6. Saint Joseph's ancestral home.

   Joseph, whom I saw in this vision at about the age of eight, was very
   different in character from his brothers. He was very gifted and was a
   very good scholar, but he was simple, quiet, devout, and not at all
   ambitious. His brothers knocked him about and played all kinds of
   tricks on him. The boys had separate little gardens, at the entrance of
   which stood figures like babies in swaddling clothes on pillars, but
   sheltered a little (in niches perhaps?). I have often seen figures like
   these, and there were some on the curtain which hung by the
   praying-place of St. Anne and also of the Blessed Virgin, but on Mary's
   curtain this figure held something in its arms that reminded me of a
   chalice with something wriggling out of it. Here in St. Joseph's house
   the figures were like babies in swaddling clothes with round faces
   surrounded by rays. In still earlier times I noticed many figures of
   this kind, particularly in Jerusalem. They appeared, too, in the Temple
   decorations. I saw them in Egypt as well, where they sometimes had
   little caps on their heads. Amongst the figures which Rachel carried
   off from her father Laban there were some like these, but smaller, as
   well as other different ones. I have also seen these figures lying in
   little boxes or baskets in Jewish houses. I think perhaps that they
   represented the child Moses floating on the Nile, and that the
   swaddling-bands perhaps symbolized the tightly binding character of the
   Law. I often used to think that this little figure was for them what
   the Christ Child is for us.

   I saw herbs, bushes, and little trees in the boys' gardens, and I saw
   how Joseph's brothers often went in secret to his garden and trampled
   or uprooted something in it. They made him very unhappy. I often saw
   him under the colonnade in the outer court kneeling down with his face
   to the wall, praying with outstretched arms, and I saw his brothers
   creep up and kick him. I once saw him kneeling like this, when one of
   them hit him on the back, and as he did not seem to notice it, he
   repeated his attack with such violence that poor Joseph fell forward
   onto the hard stone floor. From this I realized that he was not in a
   waking condition, but had been in an ecstasy of prayer. When he came to
   himself, he did not lose his temper or take revenge, but found a hidden
   corner where he continued his prayer.

   I saw some small dwellings built against the outer walls of the house,
   inhabited by a few middle-aged women. They went about veiled, as I
   often saw women doing who lived near schools in the country. They
   seemed to form part of the household, for I often saw them going in and
   out of the house on various errands. They carried water in, washed and
   swept, closed the gratings in front of the windows, rolled up the beds
   against the walls and placed wickerwork screens in front of them. I saw
   Joseph's brothers sometimes talking to these maid-servants or helping
   them with their work and joking with them, too. Joseph did not do this;
   he was serious and solitary. It seemed to me that there were also
   daughters in the house. The lower living-rooms were arranged rather
   like those in Anna's house, but everything was more spacious. Joseph's
   parents were not very well satisfied with him; they wanted him to use
   his talents in some worldly profession, but he had no inclination for
   that. He was too simple and unpretentious for them; his only
   inclination was towards prayer and quiet work at some handicraft. When
   he was about twelve years old, I often saw him go to the other side of
   Bethlehem to escape from his brothers' perpetual teasing. Not far from
   the future cave of the Nativity there was a little community of pious
   women belonging to the Essenes, who dwelt in a series of rock-chambers
   in a hollowed-out part of the hill on which Bethlehem stood. They
   tended little gardens near their dwellings and taught the children of
   other Essenes. Little Joseph went to visit these women, and I often
   used to see him escaping from his brothers' teasing to go to them and
   join in their prayers, which they read by the light of a lamp in their
   cave from a scroll hanging on the wall. I also saw him visiting the
   caves of which one was afterwards the birthplace of Our Lord. He prayed
   there quite alone, or made all kinds of little things out of wood; for
   there was an old carpenter who had his workshop near these Essenes with
   whom Joseph spent much of his time. He helped him with his work and so
   little by little learnt his craft. The art of measuring which he had
   practiced at home under his master's tuition was here of great use to
   him.

   His brothers' hostility at last made it impossible for him to remain
   any longer in his parents' house; I saw that a friend from Bethlehem
   (which was separated from his home by a little stream) gave him clothes
   in which to disguise himself. In these he left the house at night in
   order to earn his living in another place by his carpentry. He might
   have been eighteen to twenty years old at that time.

   To begin with, I saw him working with a carpenter at Lebona. [69] This
   was the place where he first really learnt his craft. His master had
   his dwelling against some ancient walls which ran from the town along a
   narrow ledge of hill, like a road leading up to some ruined castle.
   Several poor people lived in the walls. I saw Joseph making long stakes
   in a place between high walls with openings above to let in light.
   These stakes were frames for wicker-screens. His master was a poor man,
   and made mostly only such common things as these rough wicker-screens.
   Joseph was very devout, good, and simple-minded, everybody loved him. I
   saw him helping his master very humbly in all sorts of ways--picking up
   shavings, collecting wood, and carrying it back on his shoulders. In
   later days he passed by here with the Blessed Virgin on one of their
   journeys, and I think he visited his former workshop with her.

   His parents thought at first that he had been carried off by robbers;
   but I saw that he was discovered at last by his brothers and severely
   taken to task, for they were ashamed of his low way of life. He was,
   however, too humble to give it up; though he left that place and worked
   afterwards at Thanath, [70] near Megiddo, by a small river called
   Kishon which runs into the sea. (This place is not far from Apheca,
   [71] the home of the Apostle Thomas.) Joseph lived here with a
   well-to-do master, and the carpenter's work which they did was of a
   higher quality. Later still I saw him working in Tiberias for a
   master-carpenter. He might have been as much as thirty-three years old
   at that time. His parents in Bethlehem had been dead for some time. Two
   of his brothers still lived in Bethlehem; the others were dispersed.
   The parental home had passed into other hands, and the whole family had
   come down in the world very rapidly. Joseph was very devout and prayed
   fervently for the coming of the Messiah. He was just engaged in
   building beside his dwelling a more retired room for prayer, when an
   angel appeared to him and told him not to do this, for, as once the
   patriarch Joseph at about this time had, by God's will, been made
   overseer of all the corn of Egypt, so he, the second Joseph, should now
   be entrusted with the care of the granary of salvation. [72] Joseph in
   his humility did not understand this, and gave himself up to continual
   prayer, till he received the call to betake himself to Jerusalem to
   become by divine decree the spouse of the Blessed Virgin. I never saw
   that he was married before; he was very retiring and avoided women.

1. AN ELDER BROTHER OF ST. JOSEPH

   [Later in Catherine Emmerich's visions we shall come across various
   other allusions to the family history of Joseph and in particular of
   his brothers. These allusions are, however, too scattered and
   interwoven in the great mass of her communications for the writer to
   collect them all together in this place with certainty and clarity.
   Since, however, an opportunity occurs here unsought, we will mention an
   elder brother of Joseph's who lived in Galilee.

   [When we were looking up in our diaries the passage where Catherine
   Emmerich explained on August 24 ^th, 1821, the relationship between
   Joseph and Joachim (see p. 18 ), we found a detailed account given by
   her on the same day (being the feast of St. Bartholomew) of a story
   from the life of that apostle. This vision had presented itself very
   vividly to her in connection with a relic of the saint. In the course
   of it she stated that the father of Bartholomew of Geshur had for some
   long time frequented the healing waters near Bethulia and had
   afterwards settled permanently in the region, chiefly on account of his
   friendship with an elder brother of Joseph. She added:]

   He went to a valley near Dabbesheth which was the home of Zadoch, a
   devout man and an elder brother of Joseph. The devout father of
   Bartholomew had become much attached to him during his sojourn at
   Bethulia. Zadoch had two sons and two daughters, and these children
   were on friendly terms with the Holy Family. When the twelve-year-old
   Jesus remained behind in the Temple and his parents missed him, this
   was one of the families in which they sought for Him. I saw the sons
   amongst Jesus' playmates when He was a boy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [69] It appears from various communications of Catherine Emmerich's
   about the ministry of Our Lord that the town in which St. Joseph first
   worked was not the Libna which is in the tribe of Judah some hours to
   the west of Bethlehem, but Lebona on the south side of Mount Garizim.
   According to the Book of Judges 21.19, it is to be found north of
   Shiloh. (CB)

   [70] Thanath or Thaanath (see Joshua 16.6) lies, according to Eusebius,
   ten miles to the east of Nablus in the direction of the Jordan, whereas
   the place here mentioned by Catherine Emmerich must, by her account,
   lie north-west of Nablus. She must therefore no doubt have meant
   Thanach instead of Thanath, and have been misunderstood by the writer,
   who at the time had no knowledge whatever of the geography of Palestine
   and no means of supplying it. Such misunderstanding was all the more
   likely to occur because Catherine Emmerich when ill or in a state of
   ecstasy often pronounced the names somewhat unclearly in her low-German
   Münster dialect and sometimes mixed them up. A further convincing proof
   that she here meant Thanach may be found in the daily account which she
   gave in 1823 of the third year of Our Lord's ministry. She saw in her
   visions that Jesus taught on the 25th and 26th of the month Siva in
   Thanach, a town of the Levites near Megiddo, and that He visited there
   the former carpenter's shop of his foster-father Joseph. (CB)

   [71] Apheca is about twenty-five miles north of Thanach. (SB)

   [72] The same idea is found in St. Bernard's Homilia 2 super Missus
   est, recited in the Breviary on St. Joseph's feast. (SB)
     __________________________________________________________________

                       VI. A SON IS PROMISED TO ZECHARIAH

   I saw Zechariah talking with Elizabeth of his grief; it was near the
   time for his turn of service in the Temple, and it was always with
   sorrow that he went, for he was looked on with contempt there because
   of his unfruitfulness. Zechariah had to perform his service in the
   Temple twice a year.

   They lived not in Hebron itself, but in Juttah, about an hour's
   distance from it. There were many remains of walls between Juttah [73]
   and Hebron, as if these two places had once been connected with each
   other. On the other sides of Hebron were also many scattered buildings
   and groups of houses, the remains, it seemed, of the former city of
   Hebron, which must once have been as large as Jerusalem. Priests of
   lower rank lived at Hebron, while those of higher rank lived at Juttah.
   Zechariah was a kind of superior of the latter. He and Elizabeth were
   held in great honor there for their virtue and their unbroken descent
   from Aaron.

   I then saw how Zechariah and several other priests of the neighborhood
   met together on a small farm which he owned near Juttah. There was a
   garden with various arbors and a little house. Zechariah prayed here
   with his companions and taught them. It was a kind of preparation for
   the forthcoming service at the Temple. I also heard him speak of his
   heaviness of heart, and how he had a presentiment that something was
   about to befall him.

   I then saw him go with these people to Jerusalem; he had to wait four
   days more before it was his turn to sacrifice. In the meantime he
   prayed in the Temple. When it was his turn to kindle the
   incense-offering, I saw him go into the Holy Place, where the golden
   altar of incense stood in front of the entrance to the Holy of Holies.
   The ceiling above it had been opened so that one could see the sky. One
   could not see the sacrificing priest from outside, but one could see
   the smoke rising up. When Zechariah had entered, another priest said
   something to him and then went away. [74]

   Now that Zechariah was alone, I saw him go through a curtain into a
   place where it was dark. He brought something out from there which he
   placed on the altar, and kindled fire to make smoke. Then I saw a
   radiance descending upon him from the right side of the altar, and
   within it a shining figure approaching him, and I saw how he sank down
   towards the right-hand side of the altar in alarm and at the same time
   rigid in ecstasy. The angel lifted him up and spoke with him for a long
   time, and Joachim answered him. I saw the heavens opening above
   Zechariah, and two angels descending and ascending as if on a ladder.
   His girdle was loosened and his robe was open, and it appeared to me as
   if one of the angels took something from him and as if the other put
   into his side as it were a little shining substance. That was what
   happened also when Joachim received the blessing of the angel for the
   conception of the Blessed Virgin. It was usual for the priests to leave
   the Holy Place as soon as they had kindled the incense-offering, so
   when Zechariah was so long in coming out, those praying outside became
   anxious. He had become dumb, and I saw him writing on a tablet before
   coming out. When he emerged from the Temple and came into the outer
   court, a crowd gathered round him and asked why he had stayed so long.
   But he could not speak; he waved his hands and pointed to his mouth and
   to the tablet, which he at once sent to Elizabeth at Juttah, to tell
   her of the merciful promise of God and of his own dumbness. After a
   short time he returned there himself; Elizabeth had also been given a
   revelation, but I can no longer remember what it was.

   [This rather incomplete account is all that Catherine Emmerich, who was
   ill at the time, related on this subject; see St. Luke 1. 5-25.]

   incense-offering'. See Mishnah, tract. Tamid, 6, § 3, edit. Surenh, p.
   305. (CB) The tractate Tamid, IV-VII, describes the whole course of the
   daily sacrifice. This passage is in tome V, p. 305, in the edition of

                 VII. MARRIAGE OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN TO JOSEPH

   The Blessed Virgin lived with other virgins in the Temple under the
   care of pious matrons. The maidens employed themselves with embroidery
   and other forms of decoration of carpets and vestments, and also with
   the cleaning of these vestments and of the vessels used in the Temple.
   They had little cells, from which they could see into the Temple, and
   here they prayed and meditated. When these maidens were grown-up, they
   were given in marriage. Their parents in dedicating them to the Temple
   had offered them entirely to God, and the devout and more spiritual
   Israelites had for a long time had a secret presentiment that the
   marriage of one of these virgins would one day contribute to the coming
   of the promised Messiah. [75]

   When the Blessed Virgin had reached the age of fourteen and was to be
   dismissed from the Temple with seven other maidens to be married, I saw
   that her mother Anna had come to visit her there. Joachim was no longer
   alive and Anna had by God's command married again. When the Blessed
   Virgin was told that she must now leave the Temple and be married, I
   saw her explaining to the priests in great distress of heart that it
   was her desire never to leave the Temple, that she had betrothed
   herself to God alone and did not wish to be married. She was, however,
   told that it must be so.'

   Hereupon I saw the Blessed Virgin supplicating God with great fervor in
   her praying cell. I also remember that I saw Mary, who was parched with
   thirst as she prayed, going down with a little jug to draw water from a
   fountain or cistern, and that she there heard a voice (unaccompanied by
   any visible appearance) and received a revelation which comforted her
   and gave her strength to consent to her marriage. This was not the
   Annunciation, for I saw that happen later in Nazareth. I must, however,
   once have thought that I saw the appearance of an angel here too, for
   in my youth I often confused this vision with the Annunciation and
   thought that I saw the latter happening in the Temple. [76]

   I saw, too, that a very aged priest, who could no longer walk (it was
   doubtless the high priest), was carried on a chair by others before the
   Holy of Holies, and that while the incense-offering was being kindled,
   he read prayers from a parchment scroll lying on a stand in front of
   him. I saw that he was in a spiritual ecstasy and saw a vision, and
   that the forefinger of his hand was laid upon the passage of Isaiah in
   the scroll: "And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse;
   and a flower shall rise up out of his root." [ Is. 11.1.]

   When the old priest came to himself again, he read this passage and
   apprehended something from it.

   Then I saw that messengers were sent throughout the land and all
   unmarried men of the line of David summoned to the Temple. When these
   were assembled in large numbers at the Temple in festal garments, the
   Blessed Virgin was presented to them. Among them I saw a very devout
   youth from the region of Bethlehem; he had always prayed with great
   fervor for the fulfillment of the Promise, and I discerned in his heart
   an ardent longing to become Mary's husband. She, however, withdrew
   again into her cell in tears, unable to bear the thought that she
   should not remain a virgin.

   I now saw that the high priest, in accordance with the inner
   instruction he had received, handed a branch to each of the men
   present, and commanded each to inscribe his branch with his name and to
   hold it in his hands during the prayer and sacrifice.

   After they had done this, their branches were collected and laid upon
   an altar before the Holy of Holies, and they were told that the one
   among them whose branch blossomed was destined by the Lord to be
   married to the maiden Mary of Nazareth. While the branches lay before
   the Holy of Holies the sacrifice and prayer were continued, and
   meanwhile I saw that youth, whose name will perhaps come back to me,
   [77] in a hall of the Temple crying passionately to God with
   outstretched arms. I saw him burst into tears when after the appointed
   interval their branches were given back to them with the announcement
   that none had blossomed, and therefore none of them was the bridegroom
   destined by God for this maiden. The men were now sent home, but that
   youth betook himself to Mount Carmel, to the sons of the prophets who
   had lived there as hermits ever since the time of Elijah. From then on
   he spent his time in continual prayer for the fulfillment of the
   Promise.

   I then saw the priests in the Temple making a fresh search in the
   ancestral tables to see whether there was any descendant of David's who
   had been overlooked. As they found that of six brothers registered at
   Bethlehem one was missing and unknown, they made search for his
   dwelling-place, and found Joseph not far from Samaria in a place beside
   a little stream, where he lived alone by the water and worked for
   another master. On the command of the high priest, Joseph now came,
   dressed in his best, to the Temple at Jerusalem. He, too, had to hold a
   branch in his hand during the prayer and sacrifice, and as he was about
   to lay this on the altar before the Holy of Holies, a white flower like
   a lily blossomed out of the top of it, and I saw over him an appearance
   of light like the Holy Ghost. [78] Joseph was now recognized as
   appointed by God to be the bridegroom of the Blessed Virgin, and was
   presented to her by the priests in the presence of her mother. Mary,
   submissive to the Will of God, accepted him meekly as her bridegroom,
   for she knew that all things were possible with God, who had accepted
   her vow to belong to Him alone, body and soul.

1. ABOUT MARY AND JOSEPHS WEDDING AND NUPTIAL CLOTHES.

   [In the course of her continuous visions of Our Lord's daily ministry,
   Catherine Emmerich (on September 24 ^th, 1821) saw Jesus teaching in
   the synagogue at Gophna, four days before His baptism. He was dwelling
   with the family of a head of the synagogue related to Joachim. On this
   occasion she heard two widows, his daughters, exchanging remembrances
   of the wedding of Jesus' parents, at which they had been present in
   their youth with other relations. Of this she told what follows.]

   While the two widows were recalling the wedding of Mary and Joseph as
   they talked together, I saw a picture of this wedding and in particular
   of the beautiful wedding garments of the Blessed Virgin, of which these
   good women could not say enough. I will tell you what I can still
   remember.

   The wedding of Mary and Joseph, which lasted for seven or eight days,
   was celebrated on Mount Sion in Jerusalem in a house which was often
   hired out for festivities of this kind. Besides Mary's teachers and
   schoolfellows from the Temple school many relations of Anna and Joachim
   were present, amongst others a family from Gophna with two daughters.
   The wedding was very ceremonious and elaborate. Many lambs were
   slaughtered and sacrificed. The Blessed Virgin's wedding garments were
   so remarkably beautiful and splendid that the women who were present
   used to enjoy speaking about them even in their old age. In my vision I
   heard their conversation and saw the following:

   I saw Mary in her wedding-dress very distinctly. [Please refer to
   Figure 7.] She wore a white woolen undergarment without sleeves: her
   arms were wrapped round with strips of the same stuff, for at that time
   these took the place of closed sleeves. Next she put on a collar
   reaching from above the breast to her throat. It was encrusted with
   pearls and white embroidery, and was shaped like the under-collar worn
   by Archos the Essene, the pattern of which I cut out not long ago [see
   pp. 12 - 13 ]. Over this she wore an ample robe, open in front. It fell
   to her feet and was as full as a mantle and had wide sleeves. This robe
   had a blue ground covered with an embroidered or woven pattern of red,
   white, and yellow roses interspersed with green leaves, like rich and
   ancient chasubles. The lower hem ended in fringes and tassels, while
   the upper edge joined the white neck-covering. After this robe had been
   arranged to fall in long straight folds, a kind of scapulary was put on
   over it, such as some religious wear, for instance the Carmelites. This
   was made of white silk with gold flowers: it was half a yard wide, and
   was set with pearls and shining jewels at the breast. It hung in a
   single width down to the edge of the dress, of which it covered the
   opening in front. The lower edge was ornamented with fringes and beads.
   A similar width hung down the back, while shorter and narrower strips
   of the silk hung over the shoulders and arms; these four pieces, spread
   out round the neck, made the shape of a cross. The front and back
   pieces of this scapulary were held together under the arms by gold
   laces or little chains; the fullness of the robe was thus gathered
   together in front and the jeweled breast-piece pressed against it; the
   flowered material of the robe was a little puffed out in the openings
   between the laces. The full sleeves, over which the shoulder-pieces of
   the scapulary projected, were lightly held together by bracelets above
   and below the elbow. These bracelets, which were about two fingers in
   breadth and engraved with letters, had twisted edges. They caused the
   full sleeves to puff out at the shoulders, elbows, and wrists. The
   sleeves ended in a white frill of silk or wool, I think. Over all this
   she wore a sky-blue mantle, shaped like a big cloak, which in its turn
   was covered by a sort of mourning cloak with sleeves made after a
   traditional fashion. These cloaks were worn by Jewish women at certain
   religious or domestic ceremonies. Mary's cloak was fastened at the
   breast, under her neck, with a brooch, above which, round her neck, was
   a white frill of what looked like feathers or floss silk. This cloak
   fell back over the shoulders, came forward again at the sides, and
   ended at the back in a pointed train. Its edge was embroidered with
   gold flowers.

   Figure 7. Mary in her wedding dress.

   The adornment of her hair was indescribably beautiful. It was parted in
   the middle of her head and divided into a number of little plaits.
   [Please refer to Figure 8.] These, interwoven with white silk and
   pearls, formed a great net falling over her shoulders and ending in a
   point half-way down her back. The ends of the plaits were curled
   inwards, and this whole net of hair was edged with a decorated border
   of fringes and pearls, whose weight held it down and kept it in place.
   Her hair was encircled by a wreath of white unspun silk or wool, three
   strips of the same material meeting in a tuft on the top of her head
   and holding it in place. On this wreath rested a crown of about a
   hand's-breadth, decorated with jewels and surmounted by three bands of
   metal crowned by a knob. This crown was ornamented in front with three
   pearls, one above the other, and with one pearl on each side.

   Figure 8. Mary's hair adorned for her wedding.

   In her left hand she carried a little silken wreath of red and white
   roses, and in her right hand, like a scepter, a beautiful gilded torch
   in the shape of a candlestick without a foot. Its stem (thicker in the
   middle than at the ends) was decorated with knobs above and below where
   it was held. It was surmounted by a flat cup in which a white flame was
   burning.

   The shoes had soles two fingers thick heightened at toe and heel. These
   soles were made entirely of green material, so that the foot seemed to
   rest on grass. Two white-and-gold straps held them fast over the instep
   of the bare foot, and the toes were covered by a little flap which was
   attached to the sole and was always worn by well-dressed women.

   It was the Temple maidens who plaited Mary's beautiful hair
   arrangement; I saw it being done, several of them were busy with it and
   it went quicker than one would think. Anna had brought the beautiful
   clothes which Mary in her humility was unwilling to wear. After the
   wedding the network of hair was thrown up over her head, the crown was
   removed, and a milk-white veil put on her which hung down to her
   elbows. The crown was then put on again over this veil.

   The Blessed Virgin had very abundant hair, reddish-gold in color. Her
   high, delicately traced eyebrows were black; she had a very high
   forehead, large downcast eyes with long black lashes, a rather long
   straight nose, delicately shaped, a noble and lovely mouth, and a
   pointed chin. She was of middle height, and moved about in her rich
   dress very gently and with great modesty and seriousness. At her
   wedding she afterwards put on another dress of striped stuff, less
   grand, a piece of which I possess among my relics. She wore this
   striped dress also at Cana and on other holy occasions. She wore her
   wedding-dress again in the Temple several times.

   Very rich people used to change their dresses three or four times at
   weddings. Mary in her grand garments looked like the great ladies of
   much later times; for instance, the Empress Helena, or even Cunegundis,
   although the manner in which Jewish women muffled themselves up on
   ordinary occasions was very different and was more after the fashion of
   Roman women. (In connection with these clothes I observed that very
   many weavers lived near the Cenacle on Mount Sion, who made many kinds
   of beautiful materials.)

   Joseph wore a long full coat of pale blue, fastened down the front from
   breast to hem with laces and bosses or buttons. His wide sleeves were
   also fastened at the sides with laces; they were much turned up and
   seemed to have pockets inside. Round his neck he wore a kind of brown
   collar or rather a broad stole, and two white strips hung over his
   breast, like the bands worn by our priests, only much longer. [See
   Figure 9.]

   I saw the whole course of the marriage of Joseph and Mary and the
   wedding banquet and all the festivities, but I saw so many other things
   at the same time, and am so ill and so disturbed in many ways, that I
   do not venture to say more about it for fear of confusing my account.

2. MARY'S WEDDING-RING.

   [On July 29 ^th, 1821, Catherine Emmerich had a vision of the separate
   grave-clothes of Our Lord Jesus and of images of Our Lord which had
   been miraculously imprinted on cloths. Her visions led her through
   various places in which these holy relics were sometimes preserved with
   great honor and sometimes forgotten by men and venerated only by the
   angels and by devout souls. In the course of these visions she thought
   that she saw the Blessed Virgin's wedding-ring preserved in one of
   these places, and spoke of it as follows:]

   I saw the Blessed Virgin's wedding-ring; it is neither of silver nor of
   gold, nor of any other metal; it is dark in color and iridescent; it is
   not a thin narrow ring, but rather thick and at least a finger broad. I
   saw it smooth and yet as if covered with little regular triangles in
   which were letters. On the inside was a flat surface. The ring is
   engraved with something. I saw it kept behind many locks in a beautiful
   church. Devout people about to be married take their wedding-rings to
   touch it.

   Figure 9. Saint Joseph in his wedding garments.

   [On August 3 ^rd, 1821, she said:] In the last few days I have seen
   much of the story of Mary's wedding-ring, but as the result of
   disturbances and pain I can no longer give a connected account of it.
   Today I saw a festival in a church in Italy where the wedding-ring is
   to be found. It seemed to me to be hung up in a kind of monstrance
   which stood above the Tabernacle. There was a large altar there,
   magnificently decorated, one saw deep into it through much silverwork.
   I saw many rings being held against the monstrance. During the festival
   I saw Mary and Joseph appearing in their wedding garments on each side
   of the ring, as if Joseph were placing the ring on the Blessed Virgin's
   finger. At the same time I saw the ring shining and as if in movement.
   [79]

   To the right and left of this altar I saw two other altars, which were
   probably not in the same church, but were only shown to me in my vision
   as being together. In the altar to the right was an Ecce Homo picture
   of Our Lord, which a devout Roman senator, a friend of St. Peter's, had
   received in a miraculous manner. In the altar to the left was one of
   the grave-clothes of Our Lord.

   When the wedding festivities were over, Anna went back to Nazareth with
   her relations, and Mary also went there, accompanied by several of her
   playmates who had been discharged from the Temple at the same time as
   her. They left the city in a festal procession. I do not know how far
   the maidens accompanied her. They once more spent the first night in
   the Levites' school at Bethoron. Mary made the return journey on foot.

   Joseph went to Bethlehem after the wedding in order to settle some
   family affairs there. He did not come to Nazareth until later.

3. FROM MARY'S RETURN HOME TO THE ANNUNCIATION.

   [Catherine Emmerich always had these visions of the story of the Holy
   Family on the days appointed by the Church for their celebration;
   nevertheless, the date on which she saw some of these events sometimes
   differed from the ecclesiastical feast days. For instance, she saw the
   real historical date of the birth of Christ a whole month earlier, on
   November 25 ^th, which according to her visions coincided with the
   tenth day of the month Kislev in that year. Fifteen days later she saw
   Joseph keeping for several days the Feast of the Dedication of the
   Temple, or the Feast of Lights (which began on the 25 ^th day of the
   month Kislev) by burning lights in the cave of the Crib. From this it
   follows that she saw the Feast of the Annunciation also a month
   earlier, i.e. on February 25 ^th. It was in the year 1821 that
   Catherine Emmerich first gave an account of this event. She was
   seriously ill at that time, and her statement was therefore somewhat
   fragmentary to begin with.

   [She had stated earlier that Joseph did not go to Nazareth immediately
   after the wedding, but had journeyed to Bethlehem to arrange certain
   family affairs. Anna and her second husband and the Blessed Virgin with
   some of her playmates went back to Galilee to Anna's home, which was
   about an hour's distance from Nazareth. Anna arranged for the Holy
   Family the little house in Nazareth, which also belonged to her, the
   Blessed Virgin still living with her in the meantime during Joseph's
   absence. Before communicating her vision of the Annunciation, Catherine
   Emmerich recounted two fragments of earlier visions, whose significance
   we can only conjecture. Some time after the marriage of the Blessed
   Virgin to Joseph she recounted, still in a very weak state after a
   serious illness:]

   I had sight of a festival in Anna's house. I noticed her second
   husband, some six guests besides the ordinary household, and some
   children collected with Joseph and Mary round a table on which stood
   goblets. The Blessed Virgin was wearing a colored cloak, woven with
   red, blue, and white flowers like ancient chasubles. She had a
   transparent veil and over it a black one. This festival seemed to be a
   continuation of the wedding festival.

   [She related no more about this, and one may suppose that it was the
   meal taken when the Blessed Virgin left her mother after Joseph's
   arrival and moved into the house in Nazareth with him. Next day she
   related:] Last night in my vision I was looking for the Blessed Virgin,
   and my guide brought me into the house of her mother Anna, which I
   recognized in all its details. I no longer found Joseph and Mary there.
   I saw Anna preparing to go to the near-by Nazareth, where the Holy
   Family now lived. She had a bundle under her arm to take to Mary. She
   went over a plain and through a thicket to Nazareth, which lies in
   front of a hill. I went there, too. Joseph's house was not far from the
   gate; it was not so large as Anna's house. A quadrangular fountain to
   which several steps led down was near by, and there was a small square
   court before the house. I saw Anna visiting the Blessed Virgin and
   giving her what she had brought. I saw, too, that Mary shed many tears
   and accompanied her mother, when she returned home, for part of the
   way. I noticed St. Joseph in the front part of the house in a separate
   room.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [75] Although in general late Jewish writers contest the statement that
   women or virgins were engaged in the service of the Temple, we find
   confirmation that this was so partly on the authority of the Church
   (which celebrates the Feast of Our Lady's Presentation on Nov. 21st)
   and partly in the Bible and in ancient writings. Already in the time of
   Moses (see Exod. 38.8), and again in the last days of the Judges (1 Sam
   2.22), we find women or virgins employed in the service of the Temple;
   and in the description in Ps. 68 of the bringing of the Ark of the
   Covenant to Mount Sion, there is an allusion in verses 25-26 to young
   damsels playing on timbrels'. The statement that virgins were dedicated
   to the Temple and brought up there is confirmed by Evodius, a pupil of
   the Apostles and successor of St. Peter at Antioch (it is true that
   this is in a letter first appearing in Nicephor, II, c. 3), who
   expressly refers to Our Blessed Lady in this connection. Gregory of
   Nyssa and John Damascene, amongst others, also mention this, while
   Rabbi Asarja states in his work Imre Binah, c. 6o, that virgins devoted
   to God's service lived in community in the Temple. We are thus able to
   quote a Jewish authority for the existence of these Temple maidens.
   (CB) Nicephor is the fourteenth-century Byzantine historian Nicephorus
   Callistus, who wrote Ecclesiasticae Historiae, libri XVIII. Rabbi
   Azarias ben Moses de'Rossi (1513/4-1578) was an Italian Jew. The
   treatise Imre Bina (words of understanding') forms a part of his chief
   work, Meor Enayim (light of the eyes'), published at Mantua in 1574.
   Both are therefore very late authorities. (SB) In the Old Testament the
   state of virginity was, at least in general, not considered as
   meritorious. Among the countless forms of vows, which according to the
   Mishnah were usual amongst the Jews of old, we find no trace of any vow
   of chastity. As long as the coming of the Redeemer was in expectation
   only, a marriage rich in children was the height of blessedness and
   godliness on earth. See Ps. 126.3: The inheritance of the Lord are
   children; the reward, the fruit of the womb': and, for one of God's
   early blessings, see Deut. 7.14: Blessed shall you be among all people.
   No one shall be barren among you of either sex.' This explains why the
   priests did not yield to Mary's wish, even though instances of persons
   vowed to chastity, especially among the Essenes, were by no means
   unknown. (CB)

   [76] It is remarkable that the apocryphal Protevangelium of James',
   which the Church has pronounced not to be genuine, states among other
   things that Mary journeyed from the Temple to Nazareth accompanied by
   several maidens. These had been given by the Temple various threads to
   spin, of which the scarlet and purple ones had fallen to Mary's lot.
   Taking a jug, she went out to draw water, and lo, a voice said to her,
   Hail, Mary', etc. Mary looked to right and left, to discover whence
   this voice came, and went into the house in alarm. She put down the
   jug, took the purple thread and laid it on her chair to work, and lo,
   the angel of the Lord stood before her face and said, Fear not, Mary',
   etc. Thus here, too, there is an allusion to a voice while Our Lady was
   fetching water, but all happens in Nazareth and is connected with the
   Annunciation. This event is similarly described in the apocryphal
   History of Joachim and Anna and of the birth of Mary the blessed Mother
   of God ever virgin and of the Childhood of the Redeemer,' printed by
   Thilo from a Latin MS. in the Paris library; except that in this case
   an interval of three days elapses between the voice at the fountain and
   the appearance of the angel in salutation. (CB) CB's note needs
   clarifying. AC distinguishes two angelic visits, the first here at the
   well, at Jerusalem, with no apparition and no recorded voice (not in
   the Gospel), and the second, later at Nazareth, after the wedding, the
   Annunciation proper ( Luke 5.26-38). Among the Apocryphal Gospels Nat.
   Mar. 9 simply follows St. Luke (one visit at Nazareth), while Ps-Matt.
   9 gives the two visits, at the well and the Annunciation, at one day's
   interval, but with no exact indication of place, and Protev. II (as
   given here by CB) combines the episode at the well and the
   Annunciation, and places it all at Nazareth. J. C. Thilo published a
   collection of apocryphal texts at Leipzig in 1832. (SB)

   [77] He is by tradition called Agabus, and in Raphael's representation
   of the Betrothal of Our Lady (generally called Sposalizio') he is
   pictured as a youth breaking his staff over his knee. (CB)

   [78] The miracle of Joseph's rod (with the dove issuing from the rod)
   appears in Protev. 9, Ps-Matt. 8, and (with the dove alighting on the
   rod) in Nat. Mar. 8. The name Agabus for the unsuccessful suitor is not
   found elsewhere. (SB)

   [79] When the writer copied down these words of Catherine Emmerich--on
   Aug. 4 ^th, 1821, he could not think of any reason why she should have
   seen this picture on Aug. 3 ^rd. He was therefore greatly surprised at
   reading, several years after Catherine Emmerich's death, in a Latin
   document about the Blessed Virgin's wedding-ring (which is preserved in
   Perugia), that it is shown to the public on Aug. 3 ^rd (III nonas
   Augusti). Of this probably neither of us knew anything. (CB) Our Lady's
   wedding-ring is preserved at the Cathedral of Perugia in a chapel which
   also has a fine tabernacle (mentioned by AC) by Cesarino del Roscetto,
   of 1519. Cf. Baedeker. (SB)

                             VIII. THE ANNUNCIATION

   [On March 25^th, 1821, Sister Emmerich said:] Last night I saw the
   Annunciation as a Feast of the Church, and was once more definitely
   informed that at this moment the Blessed Virgin had already been with
   child for four weeks. This was expressly told me because I had already
   seen the Annunciation on the 25^th of February, but had rejected the
   vision and had not related it. Today I again saw the exterior
   circumstances of the whole event.

   Soon after the Blessed Virgin's marriage I saw her in Joseph's house in
   Nazareth, where I was taken by my guide. Joseph had gone away with two
   donkeys--I think to fetch either his tools or something that he had
   inherited. He seemed to me to be on his way home. Anna's second husband
   and some other men had been at the house in the morning, but had gone
   away again. Besides the Blessed Virgin and two girls of her own age (I
   think they were playfellows from the Temple), I saw in the house Anna
   and her widowed cousin, who worked for her as serving-maid and later
   went with her to Bethlehem after Christ's birth. The whole house had
   been newly fitted out by Anna. I saw these four women going busily
   about the house and then walking at leisure together in the courtyard.
   Towards evening I saw them come back into the house and stand praying
   at a little round table. Then, after eating some vegetables set before
   them, they separated. Anna went to and fro in the house for some time
   still, busying herself with household matters. The two girls went to
   their separate room, and Mary, too, went into her bedchamber.

   The Blessed Virgin's bedchamber was in the back part of the house, near
   the hearth, which was here placed, not in the center as in Anna's
   house, but rather on one side. The entrance to the bedchamber was
   beside the kitchen. Three steps, not level but sloping, led up to it,
   for the floor of this part of the house rested on a raised ledge of
   rock. The wall of the room facing the door was rounded, and in this
   rounded part (which was shut off by a high wicker screen) was the
   Blessed Virgin's bed, rolled up. The walls of the room were covered up
   to a certain height with wickerwork, rather more roughly woven than the
   light movable screens. Different-colored woods had been used to make a
   little checkered pattern on them. The ceiling was formed by
   intersecting beams, the spaces between being filled with wickerwork
   decorated with star-patterns.

   I was brought into this room by the shining youth who always
   accompanies me, and I will relate what I saw as well as such a poor
   miserable creature is able.

   The Blessed Virgin came in and went behind the screen before her bed,
   where she put on a long white woolen praying-robe with a broad girdle,
   and covered her head with a yellowish white veil. Meanwhile the maid
   came in with a little lamp, lit a many-branched lamp hanging from the
   ceiling, and went away again. The Blessed Virgin then took a little low
   table which was leaning folded up against the wall and placed it in the
   middle of the room. As it leant against the wall it was just a movable
   table-leaf hanging straight down in front of two supports. Mary lifted
   up this leaf and pulled forward half of one of the supports (which was
   divided), so that the little table now stood on three legs. The
   table-leaf supported by this third leg was rounded. This little table
   was covered with a blue-and-red cloth, finished with a hanging fringe
   along the straight edge of the table. In the middle of the cloth there
   was a design, embroidered or quilted; I cannot remember whether it was
   a letter or an ornament. On the round side of the table was a white
   cloth rolled up, and a scroll of writing also lay on the table.

   The Blessed Virgin put up this little table in the middle of the room,
   between her sleeping place and the door, rather to the left, in a place
   where the floor was covered by a carpet. Then she put in front of it a
   little round cushion and knelt down with both hands resting on the
   table. The door of the room was facing her on the right, and she had
   her back to her sleeping place.

   Mary let the veil fall over her face and crossed her hands (but, not
   her fingers) before her breast. I saw her fervently praying thus for a
   long time, with her face raised to heaven. She was imploring God for
   redemption, for the promised King, and beseeching Him that her prayer
   might have some share in sending Him. She knelt long in an ecstasy of
   prayer; then she bowed her head onto her breast.

   But now at her right hand there poured down such a mass of light in a
   slanting line from the ceiling of the room that I felt myself pressed
   back by it against the wall near the door. [See Figure 10.] I saw in
   this light a shining white youth, with flowing yellow hair, floating
   down before her. It was the Angel Gabriel. He gently moved his arms
   away from his body as he spoke to her. I saw the words issuing from his
   mouth like shining letters; I read them and I heard them. Mary turned
   her veiled head slightly towards the right, but she was shy and did not
   look up. But the angel went on speaking, and as if at his command Mary
   turned her face a little towards him, raised her veil slightly, and
   answered. The angel again spoke, and Mary lifted her veil, looked at
   him, and answered with the holy words: Behold the handmaid of the Lord,
   be it done to me according to your word.'

   The Blessed Virgin was wrapped in ecstasy. The room was filled with
   light [80] ; I no longer saw the glimmer of the burning lamp, I no
   longer saw the ceiling of the room. Heaven seemed to open, a path of
   light made me look up above the angel, and at the source of this stream
   of light I saw a figure of the Holy Trinity in the form of a triangular
   radiance streaming in upon itself. In this I recognized--what can only
   be adored and never expressed--Almighty God, Father, Son and Holy
   Ghost, and yet only God Almighty.

   As soon as the Blessed Virgin had spoken the words, Be it done to me
   according to your word', I saw the Holy Ghost in the appearance of a
   winged figure, but not in the form of a dove as usually represented.
   The head was like the face of a man, and light was spread like wings
   beside the figure, from whose breast and hands I saw three streams of
   light pouring down towards the right side of the Blessed Virgin and
   meeting as they reached her. This light streaming in upon her right
   side caused the Blessed Virgin to become completely transfused with
   radiance and as though transparent; all that was opaque seemed to
   vanish like darkness before this light. In this moment she was so
   penetrated with light that nothing dark or concealing remained in her;
   her whole form was shining and transfused with light. After this
   penetrating radiance I saw the angel disappear, with the path of light
   out of which he had come. It was as if the stream of light had been
   drawn back into heaven, and I saw how there fell from it onto the
   Blessed Virgin, as it was drawn back, a shower of white rosebuds each
   with its little green leaf.

   Figure 10. The Annunciation.

   While I was seeing all this in Mary's chamber, I had a strange personal
   sensation. I was in a state of constant fear, as if I was being
   pursued, and I suddenly saw a hideous serpent crawling through the
   house and up the steps to the door by which I was standing. The
   horrible creature had made its way as far as the third step when the
   light poured down on the Blessed Virgin. The serpent was three or four
   feet long, had a broad flat head and under its breast were two short
   skinny paws, clawed like bat's wings, on which it pushed itself
   forward. It was spotted with all kinds of hideous colors, and reminded
   me of the serpent in the Garden of Eden, only fearfully deformed. When
   the angel disappeared from the Blessed Virgin's room, he trod on this
   monster's head as it lay before the door, and it screamed in so ghastly
   a way that I shuddered. Then I saw three spirits appear who drove the
   monster out in front of the house with blows and kicks.

   After the angel had disappeared, I saw the Blessed Virgin wrapped in
   the deepest ecstasy. I saw that she recognized the Incarnation of the
   promised Redeemer within herself in the form of a tiny human figure of
   light, perfectly formed in all its parts down to its tiny fingers.

   Here in Nazareth it is otherwise than in Jerusalem, where the women
   must remain in the outer court and may not enter the Temple, where only
   the priests may go into the Holy Place. Here in Nazareth, here in this
   church, a virgin is herself the Temple, and the Most Holy is within
   her, and the high priest is within her, and she alone is with Him. O,
   how lovely and wonderful that is, and yet so simple and natural! The
   words of David in the 45 ^th Psalm were fulfilled: The Most High has
   sanctified His own tabernacle; God is in the midst thereof, it shall
   not be moved.'

   It was at midnight that I saw this mystery happen. After a little while
   Anna with the other women came into Mary's room. They had been wakened
   by a strange commotion in nature. A cloud of light had appeared above
   the house. When they saw the Blessed Virgin kneeling under the lamp in
   an ecstasy of prayer, they respectfully withdrew. After some time I saw
   the Blessed Virgin rise from her knees and go to her little altar
   against the wall. She unrolled the picture hanging on the wall which
   represented a veiled human form--the same picture that I had seen in
   Anna's house when she was making ready for the Blessed Virgin's journey
   to the Temple [see p. 43 ]. She lit the lamp on the wall and stood
   praying before it. Scrolls lay before her on a high desk. Towards
   morning I saw her go to bed.

   My guide now led me away; but when I came into the little court before
   the house, I was seized with terror, for that fearful snake was lurking
   there in hiding. It crept towards me and tried to shelter in the folds
   of my dress. I was in dreadful fear; but my guide snatched me hurriedly
   away, and those three spirits reappeared and smote the monster. I still
   seem to hear with a shudder its appalling shrieks.

   That night, as I contemplated the Mystery of the Incarnation, I was
   taught many things. Mary was given the grace of interior knowledge. The
   Blessed Virgin knew that she had conceived the Messiah, the Son of the
   Most High. All that was within her was open to the eyes of her spirit.
   But she did not then know that the Throne of David His father, which
   was to be given Him by the Lord God, was a supernatural one; nor did
   she then know that the House of Jacob, over which He was, as Gabriel
   declared, to rule for all eternity, was the Church, the congregation of
   regenerated mankind. She thought that the Redeemer would be a holy
   king, who would purify His people and give them victory over Hell. She
   did not then know that this King, in order to redeem mankind, must
   suffer a bitter death.

   It was made known to me why the Redeemer deigned to remain nine months
   in His Mother's womb and to be born as a little child, and why it was
   not His will to appear as perfect and beautiful as the newly-created
   Adam; but I can no longer explain this clearly. I can, however,
   remember this much--that it was His will to reconsecrate man's
   conception and birth which had been so sadly degraded by the Fall. The
   reason why Mary became His Mother and why He did not come sooner was
   that she alone, and no creature before her or after her, was the pure
   Vessel of Grace, promised by God to mankind as the Mother of the
   Incarnate Word, by the merits of whose Passion mankind was to be
   redeemed from its guilt. The Blessed Virgin was the one and only pure
   blossom of the human race, flowering in the fullness of time. All the
   children of God from the beginning of time who have striven after
   salvation contributed to her coming. She was the only pure gold of the
   whole earth. She alone was the pure immaculate flesh and blood of the
   whole human race, prepared and purified and ordained and consecrated
   through all the generations of her ancestors, guided, guarded, and
   fortified by the Law until she came forth as the fullness of Grace. She
   was pre-ordained in eternity and passed through time as the Mother of
   the Eternal. [See Prov. 8.22-35.]

   At the Incarnation of Christ the Blessed Virgin was a little over
   fourteen years old. Christ reached the age of thirty-three years and
   three times six weeks. I say three times six, because that figure was
   in that moment shown to me three times one after the other.

                            IX. THE VISITATION [81]

1. MARY AND JOSEPH TRAVEL TO VISIT ELIZABETH.

   Some days after the Annunciation, St. Joseph returned to Nazareth and
   made further arrangements for working at his craft in the house. He had
   never lived in Nazareth before and had not spent more than a few days
   there. Joseph knew nothing of the Incarnation; Mary was the Mother of
   the Lord, but also the handmaid of the Lord, and she kept His secret in
   all humility. When the Blessed Virgin felt that the Word was made Flesh
   in her, she was conscious of a great desire to pay an immediate visit
   to her cousin Elizabeth at Juttah near Hebron, whom the angel had told
   her was now six months with child. As the time was now drawing near
   when Joseph wished to go up to Jerusalem for the Passover, the Blessed
   Virgin decided to accompany him in order to help Elizabeth in her
   pregnancy. Joseph therefore started with the Blessed Virgin on the
   journey to Juttah. [82]

   [Catherine Emmerich described the following single scenes from the
   journey of Joseph and Mary to Elizabeth; but it must be understood that
   owing to her illness and to various interruptions very many gaps occur
   in her account. She gave no description of their departure, but only a
   few pictures from successive days of their journey, which we here
   transcribe.]

   They traveled in a southerly direction and had a donkey with them, on
   which Mary rode from time to time. Some baggage was packed onto it,
   amongst which was a striped sack of Joseph's (it seemed to me to be
   knitted) in which was a long brownish garment of Mary's with a sort of
   hood. This garment was fastened in front with ribbons. Mary put it on
   when she went into the Temple or into a synagogue. On the journey she
   wore a brown woolen undergarment, and over this a gray dress with a
   girdle. Her head-covering was yellowish in color. They made the long
   journey rather quickly. I saw them, after they had crossed the plain of
   Esdrelon in a southerly direction, entering the house of a friend of
   Joseph's father in the town of Dothan, on a hill. He was a well-to-do
   man and came from Bethlehem. His father was called brother by Joseph's
   father, though he was not really his brother, but he came of David's
   line through a man who was, I think, also a king and was called Ela,
   Eldoa, or Eldad, I cannot remember clearly which it was. [83] There was
   much trading in this place.

   Once, I saw them spending the night in a shed, and one evening, when
   they were still twelve hours distant from Zechariah's dwelling, I saw
   them in a wood, going into a hut of wattle-work, on which green leaves
   and beautiful white flowers were growing. This hut was meant for
   travelers: beside the roads in that country are many open arbors like
   this, and even solid buildings. Travelers can spend the night in them,
   or shelter from the heat and prepare the food which they have brought
   with them. Some of these shelters are looked after by a family living
   near at hand who are ready to supply any needs in return for a small
   payment.

   [Here there seems to be a gap in the account. Probably the Blessed
   Virgin was present with Joseph at the Passover in Jerusalem, and did
   not go to Elizabeth until after that; for while Joseph's journey to the
   Feast is mentioned above, we are told later that Zechariah reached
   home, after attending the Passover, the day before the Visitation.]

   They did not go direct from Jerusalem to Juttah, but made a detour to
   the east in order to avoid the crowds. They passed near a little town
   two hours distant from Emmaus, and took roads which Jesus often
   traveled in the years of His ministry. They still had two hills to
   pass. Between these two hills I once saw them sitting and resting. They
   were eating bread and mixing in their drinking water drops of balsam
   which they had collected on their way. It was very hilly here. They
   passed over-hanging rocks with great caves in which were all kinds of
   strange stones. The valleys were very fertile. Then their path led them
   through wood, moorland, meadows, and fields. Towards the end of their
   journey I particularly noticed a plant with little delicate green
   leaves and with flower-clusters of nine little pale-red, closed bells
   or vessels. There was something in these with which I had to do but
   what it was I cannot remember. [84]

2. MARY AND JOSEPH ARRIVE AT THE HOUSE OF ELIZABETH AND ZECHARIAH.

   [The following visions were communicated by Catherine Emmerich partly
   at the time of the Feast of the Visitation in July 1820 and partly at a
   time when she had heard the words of Eliud, an aged Essene from
   Nazareth. Eliud accompanied Jesus on His journey to His Baptism by John
   in September of the first year of His ministry, and told Him many
   things about the history of His parents and of His earliest childhood,
   for Eliud was intimate with the Holy Family.]

   Zechariah's house was on the top of a hill by itself. Other houses
   stood in groups round about. Not far off a biggish stream flowed down
   from the mountain. It seemed to me to be the moment when Zechariah was
   returning home from the Passover at Jerusalem. I saw Elizabeth, moved
   by great longing, going out of her house for a considerable distance on
   the way to Jerusalem; and I saw how alarmed Zechariah was, as he made
   his way home, to meet Elizabeth on the road so far from home in her
   condition. She told him that she was so agitated in her heart because
   she could not help thinking all the time that her cousin Mary of
   Nazareth was coming to her. Zechariah tried to remove this impression
   from her mind and explained to her, by signs and by writing on a
   tablet, how unlikely it was that a newly married woman should undertake
   so long a journey just then. They went back to the house together.
   Elizabeth was, however, unable to abandon her expectation, for she had
   learnt in a dream that one of her family had become the mother of the
   promised Messiah. She had at once thought of Mary, had longed to see
   her, and had in spirit perceived her in the distance on her way to her.
   She had made ready a little room to the right of the entrance and had
   placed seats in it. On the following day she sat there for a long time
   waiting and gazing out of the house, watching for the coming visitor.
   Then she got up and went a long way on the road to meet her.

   Elizabeth was a tall aged woman with a small, delicate face. Her head
   was wrapped in a veil. She only knew the Blessed Virgin by hearsay.
   Mary saw her from far off and recognized her at once. She ran to meet
   her, while Joseph discreetly remained behind. Mary was already among
   the neighbors' houses, whose inhabitants, moved by her marvelous beauty
   and struck by a supernatural dignity in her whole being, withdrew shyly
   as she and Elizabeth met. They greeted each other warmly with
   outstretched hands, and at that moment I saw a shining brightness in
   the Blessed Virgin and as it were a ray of light passing from her to
   Elizabeth, filling the latter with wonderful joy. They did not stay
   near the people in the houses, but went, holding each other by the arm,
   through the outer court towards the house. At the door Elizabeth once
   more made Mary welcome, and they then went in. Joseph, who came into
   the court leading the donkey, handed it over to a manservant and went
   to Zechariah in an open hall at the side of the house. He greeted the
   venerable old priest with great humility. Zechariah embraced him warmly
   and spoke with him by writing on his tablet, for he was dumb since the
   angel had appeared to him in the Temple. Mary and Elizabeth, after
   passing through the house-door, came into a hall which, it seemed to
   me, was also the kitchen. Here, they took each other by both arms. Mary
   greeted Elizabeth very warmly, and each pressed her cheek against the
   other's. Again I saw a radiance stream from Mary into Elizabeth,
   whereby the latter was transfused with light. Her heart was filled with
   holy joy. She stepped back, her hand raised, and exclaimed full of
   humility, joy, and exaltation: Blessed are you among women and blessed
   is the fruit of your womb. And whence is this to me that the mother of
   my Lord should come to me? For behold as the voice of your salutation
   sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed
   are you that have believed, because those things shall be accomplished
   that were spoken to you by the Lord.'

   As she said the last words she led Mary into the little room which she
   had prepared, so that she might sit down and rest after her journey. It
   was only a few paces away. Mary let go Elizabeth's arm, which she had
   clasped, crossed her hands over her breast and uttered the Magnificat
   with exaltation.

   (When the aged Essene Eliud conversed with Jesus, as mentioned above,
   about this event, I heard him expounding the whole of Mary's song of
   praise in a wonderful manner. I feel myself, however, incapable of
   repeating this explanation.)

   I saw that Elizabeth followed in prayer the whole of the Magnificat in
   a similar state of exaltation; afterwards they sat down on quite low
   seats with a table before them, also low, on which stood a little
   goblet. O, I was so blissfully happy, I prayed with them the whole
   time, and then I sat down near at hand: oh, I was so happy! [Catherine
   Emmerich recounted this in the morning as if it had happened on the
   previous day. In the afternoon she said in her sleep:] Joseph and
   Zechariah are now together and are talking about the nearness of the
   Messiah according to the fulfillment of the prophecies. Zechariah is a
   tall handsome old man, dressed as a priest; he answers always with
   signs or by writing on a tablet. They are sitting in an open hall at
   the side of the house, looking on to the garden. Mary and Elizabeth are
   sitting in the garden on a carpet under a big spreading tree; behind it
   is a fountain from which water streams if one pulls at a tap. I see
   grass and flowers round them, and trees with little yellow plums. They
   are both eating little fruits and little loaves from Joseph's knapsack;
   what touching simplicity and frugality! There are two maidservants and
   two menservants in the house; I see them moving about here and there.
   They are preparing a table with food under a tree. Zechariah and Joseph
   come and eat a little. Joseph wanted to go back to Nazareth at once;
   but I think he is going to stay a week. He knows nothing of the Blessed
   Virgin being with child. Mary and Elizabeth were silent about it; in
   the depths of their being, there was a secret understanding between
   them. Several times in the day, and especially before meals when they
   were all together, the two holy women said a kind of litany. Joseph
   prayed with them, and I saw then a cross appear in the midst between
   the two women (although as yet there was no cross); it was indeed as
   though two crosses visited each other.

   [On July 3 ^rd she related as follows:] Yesterday evening they ate all
   together. They sat under a tree in the garden by the light of a lamp
   till nearly midnight. Then I saw Joseph and Zechariah alone in a place
   of prayer. I saw Mary and Elizabeth in their little room. They stood
   opposite each other, as if rapt in ecstasy, and said the Magnificat in
   prayer together. Besides the clothes already described the Blessed
   Virgin wore a transparent black veil as well, which she lowered when
   speaking with men. Today Zechariah took St. Joseph to another garden at
   some distance from the house. Zechariah is very orderly and precise in
   all he does. This garden is rich in beautiful trees and abundant fruit
   and is very well kept. A shady alley leads through the middle of it. At
   the end of the garden there is a little hidden summer-house with a door
   at the side. In the top of this little house are window openings closed
   by sliding shutters. In it is a wicker couch cushioned with moss or
   other delicate plants. I also saw two white statues in it, of the size
   of children. I do not quite know how they came to be there or what they
   signified, but they seemed very like Zechariah and Elizabeth, only very
   much younger.

   This afternoon I saw Mary and Elizabeth working together in the house.
   The Blessed Virgin took part in all the household work. She made
   preparations for the child that was expected. I saw them both working
   together, they were knitting a big coverlet for Elizabeth's lying-in.
   Jewish women used coverlets like these when in child-bed; an inner
   lining was fastened to the middle of it so that the mother could be
   wrapped up together in it with her child. It was as if she were in a
   little boat or in a big shoe, wrapped up herself like a child in
   swaddling clothes. She was supported on pillows and could sit upright
   or lie down, as she liked. The edges of the coverlet were sewn with
   flowers and texts. Mary and Elizabeth prepared also many different
   things as presents for the poor when the child was born. (I see Anna
   often sending her maidservant to look after everything in the house at
   Nazareth during the absence of the Holy Family. I saw her there once
   herself.)

   [On July 4 ^th she said:] Zechariah has gone with Joseph for a walk in
   the fields. His house stands by itself on a hill. It is the best house
   in the neighborhood. Others lie scattered around. Mary is rather tired.
   She is alone with Elizabeth in the house.

   [On July 5 ^th she said:] I saw Zechariah and Joseph spending last
   night in the garden which is distant from the house, either sleeping in
   the summer-house, or praying out of doors in the garden. At dawn they
   returned to the house. I saw Elizabeth and the Blessed Virgin in the
   house. Every morning and evening they joined together in prayer and
   recited the Magnificat, which Mary had received from the Holy Ghost at
   Elizabeth's greeting of her.

   With the Angel's salutation the Blessed Virgin was consecrated as the
   Church. With the words Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it done to
   me according to your word', the Word entered into her, saluted by the
   Church, by His maidservant. God was now in His Temple, Mary was now the
   Temple and the Ark of the New Covenant. Elizabeth's greeting and the
   movement of John beneath his mother's heart was the first act of
   worship of the community in the presence of this Holy Thing. When the
   Blessed Virgin uttered the Magnificat, the Church of the New Covenant,
   of the new Espousals, celebrated for the first time the fulfillment of
   the divine promises of the Old Covenant, of the old Espousals, and
   poured forth thanks with a Te Deum laudamus. Ah, who can express the
   wonder of seeing the devotion of the Church towards the Savior even
   before His Birth!

   Tonight, as I watched the two holy women at their prayers, I had many
   visions and explanations of the Magnificat and of the coming of the
   Blessed Sacrament in the present condition of the Blessed Virgin. The
   illness from which I am now suffering and many disturbances have made
   me quite forget all that I saw. From the passage in the Magnificat He
   has shown might in His arm' onwards there appeared to me all kinds of
   pictures from the Old Testament symbolic of the most holy Sacrament of
   the Altar. Amongst them was a picture of Abraham sacrificing Isaac and
   of Isaiah announcing something to a wicked king who scorned it. I have
   forgotten this. I saw many things from Abraham to Isaiah and from
   Isaiah to the Blessed Virgin, and in everything I always saw the coming
   of the Blessed Sacrament to the Church of Jesus Christ, who was Himself
   still resting under His Mother's heart. [85]

   [After Catherine Emmerich had said this, she recited the Litany of the
   Holy Ghost and the hymn Veni Sancte Spiritus and fell asleep smiling.
   After a while she said with great fervor:] I must do nothing more at
   all today and must allow nobody in. Then, I shall see again all that I
   have forgotten. If I can only have complete quiet, I shall be able to
   perceive and relate the holy mystery of the Ark of the Covenant and the
   holy Sacrament of the Old Covenant. I have seen that time of quiet; it
   is a beautiful time. I saw the writer beside me, and I am then to learn
   very many things. [As she spoke these words, her face glowed in her
   sleep like a child's: she drew from under the bed-covering her hands
   marked with the wounds of the stigmata and said:] It is very warm where
   Mary is in the Promised Land. They are now all going into the garden of
   the house, first Zechariah and Joseph and then Elizabeth and Mary. An
   awning like a tent is stretched under a tree. On one side stand low
   seats with backs to them.

   [She then continued:] I am to rest and see again all that I have
   forgotten: that sweet prayer to the Holy Ghost has helped me, so sweet
   and gentle it is. [At five o'clock in the evening she accused herself,
   saying:] I weakly gave way and did not keep the command to allow nobody
   in. A woman of my acquaintance came and talked for a long time of
   hateful incidents which angered me. Then I fell asleep. God kept His
   word better than me, for He showed me again all that I had forgotten;
   but as a punishment most of it has again escaped me. [She then said
   what follows. Although some of it is repetition, we reproduce it,
   because we cannot express what she said otherwise than she herself did.
   She said:] I saw as usual the two holy women with child standing
   opposite one another in prayer and reciting the Magnificat. In the
   middle of the prayer I was shown Abraham sacrificing Isaac. Here
   followed a series of pictures symbolizing the coming of the Blessed
   Sacrament. I do not think I have ever perceived so clearly the holy
   mysteries of the Old Covenant.

   [Next day she said:] As was promised to me, I perceived once more all
   that I had forgotten. I was full of joy at being able now to relate so
   many wonderful things about the Patriarchs and the Ark of the Covenant,
   but there must have been a lack of humility in my joy, for God ordained
   that I should no longer be able to set in order and communicate the
   innumerable things that I perceived.

   [The cause of this new disturbance was a particular incident which
   renewed in her the sufferings of Our Lord's Passion, a phenomenon
   constantly recurring in her life. This rendered her even more incapable
   of consecutive narration. However, after her visions of the repeated
   recital of the Magnificat by the two holy women, she communicated at
   intervals much that she had learnt of the mysterious blessing in the
   Old Testament and of the Ark of the Covenant, though in a fragmentary
   and disconnected manner. We have tried therefore to compile them in
   chronological order; but, that we may not interrupt the life of the
   Blessed Virgin unduly, we shall add them in an appendix or keep them
   for some other appropriate place.]

   In the evening of yesterday, Friday, July 6 ^th, I saw Elizabeth and
   the Blessed Virgin going to Zechariah's distant garden. They were
   carrying fruit and little loaves of bread in a small basket and were
   going to spend the night there. When Joseph and Zechariah came there
   later, I saw the Blessed Virgin go towards them. Zechariah had his
   little writing-tablet with him, but it had grown too dark for writing,
   and I saw that Mary, by the interior bidding of the Holy Ghost, told
   him that he would speak that night. Then I saw that Zechariah put away
   his writing-tablet, and that he was able to speak with Joseph and pray
   with him throughout that night. I saw this, and when I shook my head in
   great surprise [86] and would not accept it, my guardian angel or
   spiritual guide, who is always with me, said to me, pointing in another
   direction, You do not believe this, then turn your eyes hither!' But
   where he pointed I saw quite another picture from a much later time.

   I saw the holy hermit St. Goar [87] in a place where corn was being
   reaped. Messengers from a bishop who was ill-disposed towards him were
   talking with him with evil intent. As he started off with them to go to
   that bishop, I saw him looking round for a hook on which to hang his
   cloak. He saw a ray of the sun shining through an opening in the wall,
   and in his simple faith he hung his cloak on it, and I saw that the
   cloak remained hanging firmly fixed in the air. I was amazed at this
   miracle of simple faith, and was no longer surprised at Zechariah being
   given the power of speech by the Blessed Virgin in whom God Himself
   dwelt. My guide then spoke to me about what we call miracles, and I
   remember distinctly that he said: A living child-like confidence in God
   in all simplicity makes everything real, makes everything substantial.
   What he said gave me a complete interior understanding about all
   miracles, but I cannot express it perfectly.

   I saw the four holy people spend the night in the garden. They sat down
   and ate, or they walked two by two up and down, talking and praying,
   and took it in turns to rest in the little summer-house. I understood
   that when the Sabbath was over Joseph was to return to Nazareth, and
   that Zechariah was to accompany him for part of the way. It was
   moonlight and a clear starry sky. Round these holy people was
   indescribable peace and beauty.

   Again, as the two holy women prayed, I saw a part of the mystery of the
   Magnificat, but am again to see all in the octave of the Feast before
   Saturday or Sunday and shall then perhaps be able to tell something of
   it. I am now only permitted to say: The Magnificat is a hymn of thanks
   for the fulfillment of the blessing given in the sacrament of the Old
   Covenant.

   During Mary's prayer I saw a continuous succession of all her
   ancestors. In the course of time there followed each other three times
   fourteen marriages, in each of which the son succeeded directly to the
   father: and from each of these marriages I saw a ray of light projected
   towards Mary as she stood there in prayer. The whole vision grew before
   my eyes like a family tree made by branches of light becoming ever
   nobler and nobler, until at last, in a more clearly defined place in
   this tree of light, I saw shine forth more brightly the holy and
   immaculate flesh and blood of Mary, from which God was to become Man. I
   prayed to her in yearning and hope, as full of joy as a child who sees
   the Christmas tree towering above him. It was all a picture of the
   coming of Jesus Christ in the Flesh and of His most holy Sacrament. It
   was as though I saw the wheat ripening for the Bread of Life for which
   I hunger. It is not to be expressed; I can find no words to say how
   that Flesh was formed, in which the Word became Flesh. How can it be
   expressed by a poor mortal who is still in that flesh of which the Son
   of God and of Mary said the flesh profits nothing, it is the spirit
   that quickens? He, who said that only those who ate His flesh and drank
   His blood should have everlasting life and be raised up by Him in the
   last day. Only His flesh and blood were meat and drink indeed; only
   those who ate and drank thereof abode in Him and He in them.

   I saw, in an inexpressible way, from the beginning, from generation to
   generation, the approach of the Incarnation, and with it the approach
   of the most holy Sacrament of the Altar. Then came a series of
   patriarchs, followed by the institution of the priesthood to offer up
   the living God among men as sacrifice and food until His Second
   Coming--an institution conferred by the Incarnate God, the new and
   redeeming Adam, upon His apostles and transmitted by them by the
   laying-on of hands in an unbroken succession of generation after
   generation of priests. In all this I clearly perceived how the chanting
   of Our Lord's genealogy before the Blessed Sacrament on the Feast of
   Corpus Christi contains a great mystery. I also perceived that, just as
   amongst the ancestors of Christ according to the flesh, there were some
   who were not holy, and, indeed, were sinners, without however ceasing
   to be the rungs in Jacob's ladder on which God descended to mankind, so
   even unworthy bishops still have the power to consecrate the Blessed
   Sacrament and to impart priestly ordination with all the powers
   accompanying it. When one sees this one clearly understands why in old
   German spiritual books the Old Testament is called the Old Covenant or
   the Old Espousals, and the New Testament the New Covenant or the New
   Espousals. The highest flowering of the Old Espousals was the Virgin of
   Virgins, the Bride of the Holy Ghost, the most chaste Mother of the
   Redeemer, the spiritual vessel of honor, the singular vessel of
   devotion, in whom the Word became Flesh. With this mystery begins the
   New Espousals, the New Covenant. In the priesthood and in all those who
   follow the Lamb it bears the mark of virginity; in it marriage is a
   great sacrament, that of Christ and His Bride, the Church ( Eph. 5.32).

   In order to state as clearly as I can how the approach of the
   Incarnation, and, with it, the approach of the most Holy Sacrament of
   the Altar, was explained to me, I can only repeat how everything was
   set before my eyes in a great series of pictures. Although, it is
   impossible, owing to my present condition and to many interruptions
   from without, to bring what I saw into a detailed and comprehensible
   whole. I can only say in general: First I saw the Blessing of the
   Promise which God gave to the First Man in Paradise, and from that
   Blessing I saw a ray of light proceed to the Blessed Virgin as she
   stood there opposite St. Elizabeth, reciting the Magnificat in prayer.
   Then I saw Abraham, who had received this Blessing from God, and I
   again saw a ray of light proceeding from him to the Blessed Virgin.
   Then came the other Patriarchs who were the holders and bearers of that
   holy treasure, and from each of them a ray of light fell upon Mary.
   Then I saw the passage of this Blessing down the ages until it reached
   Joachim. He was endowed with the highest Blessing from the inmost
   sanctuary of the Temple so that he might become the father of the most
   holy Virgin Mary conceived without original sin. In her, the Word
   became Flesh by the operation of the Holy Ghost and dwelt amongst us,
   hidden for nine months in her, as the Ark of the Covenant of the New
   Testament, until, in the fullness of time, we saw His glory, born of
   the Virgin Mary, a glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father,
   full of grace and truth.

   [On July 7 ^th she said:] Last night I saw the Blessed Virgin in
   Elizabeth's house asleep in her little room, lying on her side with her
   head resting on her arm. [See Figure 11.] She was wrapped from head to
   foot in a long white covering. Beneath her heart I saw a glory of light
   streaming out; it was pear-shaped and in the center of it was an
   indescribably bright little flame of light. In Elizabeth I saw a glory
   shining which was larger and rounder but not so bright, and the light
   within it was less bright.

   [On July 8 ^th (a Saturday) she said:] When the Sabbath began
   yesterday, Friday evening, I saw a lamp being lit and the Sabbath being
   celebrated in a room in Zechariah's house which I had not seen before.
   Zechariah, Joseph, and some six other men, probably from the
   neighborhood, were praying under the lamp. They were standing round a
   chest with scrolls lying on it. They were wearing cloths hanging down
   over their heads; they did not make as many contortions as the Jews of
   today, though they occasionally bowed their heads and raised their
   arms. Mary, Elizabeth, and a few other women stood apart behind a
   grating in an alcove from which they could see into the praying-place.
   All their heads were covered with praying-mantles. After the Sabbath
   meal I saw the Blessed Virgin in her little room with Elizabeth,
   standing and reciting the

   Figure 11. Mary resting at Elizabeth's house. Magnificat in prayer. Her
   hands were crossed on her breast and her black veil lowered over her
   face; they stood opposite each other against the wall, praying as
   though in choir. I recited the Magnificat in prayer with them, and
   again, during the second part of it, which refers to the promises of
   God, I had many glimpses, near and distant, of single ancestors of
   Mary, from whom threads of light proceeded towards her, as she stood
   before me praying. These threads or rays of light came, I saw, always
   out of the mouth of her male ancestors, whereas those from the female
   ones came from under their hearts and ended in the glory within Mary.

   Abraham must (at the time when his blessing was brought to bear on the
   future of the Blessed Virgin) have lived near the place where the
   Blessed Virgin was now reciting the Magnificat, for I saw the ray of
   light from him streaming upon her from quite near; whereas, I saw the
   rays from persons much nearer to her in time coming from a much greater
   distance.

   After they had finished the Magnificat, which I always saw them
   reciting morning and evening since the Visitation, Elizabeth withdrew
   and I saw the Blessed Virgin going to bed. She took off her girdle and
   her upper garment, leaving only her long brown undergarment. She took a
   roll of stuff lying at the head of her low couch which I should
   otherwise have taken to be a bolster, but now saw was a rolled-up
   length of woolen material almost a yard wide. She held one end of it
   tight under one arm-pit, and then wrapped it round and round her body
   from head to foot and then upwards so that she was quite enveloped in
   it and could only make short steps. Her arms were free below the elbows
   and the face and throat were open. She wrapped herself up in this way
   standing beside her couch, which was slightly raised at the head, and
   then lay down straight on it, stretched out on her side, her cheek
   resting on her hand. I did not see men sleeping wrapped up in this way.

   [On Sunday, July 9 ^th, she said:] Yesterday, Saturday, I saw Zechariah
   during the whole of the Sabbath in the same dress that he put on at the
   beginning of it. He had a long white robe with not very full sleeves.
   He was girt about several times with a broad girdle inscribed with
   letters and with straps hanging from it. At the back of his robe was
   fastened a hood which fell in folds from his head down his back, like a
   veil gathered together at the back. When he had something to do in the
   course of the day on Saturday or had to go anywhere, he threw his robe
   over one shoulder and tucked it under his girdle below the other arm.
   Each leg was wrapped round with broad bands separately like trousers,
   and these wrappings were held fast by the straps with which his sandals
   were attached to his bare feet. Today he also showed Joseph his
   priest's mantle, which was very beautiful. It was an ample, heavy
   mantle, of shining material shot with purple and white, and was
   fastened at the breast with three jeweled clasps. It had no sleeves.

   I did not see them eating again until Sunday evening when the Sabbath
   was over. They ate together under the tree in the garden by the house.
   They ate green leaves which they dipped into sauce and they sucked
   little green bundles also dipped in sauce. There were also on the table
   little bowls of some small fruit, and other bowls from which they ate
   something with transparent brown flat spoons. I think it was honey,
   which they ate with flat horn spoons. I also saw little loaves being
   brought to them to eat.

   After this Joseph, accompanied by Zechariah, started on his journey
   home. It was a still moonlight night full of stars. They prayed
   beforehand all separately. Joseph again had his little bundle with him,
   in which were small loaves and a little jug, and his staff with a crook
   at the top. Zechariah had a long staff with a knob. They both wore
   their traveling mantles over their heads. Before they went, they
   embraced Mary and Elizabeth alternately by clasping them to their
   breasts. I did not see them kiss each other then. They went off gaily
   and quietly, and the two women accompanied them for a short while,
   after which they wandered off alone through the indescribably lovely
   night. Mary and Elizabeth then went back into the house, into Mary's
   room. A lamp was burning there on an arm projecting from the wall. This
   was always so when she prayed and when she went to bed. The two women
   again stood opposite to each other, veiled, and recited the Magnificat
   in prayer. On this occasion the promised vision, which I had forgotten,
   was repeated: but I have seen so much tonight that I can say but little
   of it. I only saw the handing down of the Blessing until it came to
   Joseph in Egypt.

   [On July 11 ^th she said:] Last night I had a vision of Mary and
   Elizabeth of which I only remember that they prayed the whole night
   long. I cannot recollect the cause. In the daytime I saw Mary doing all
   kinds of work, for instance, weaving coverlets. I saw Joseph and
   Zechariah still on their journey: they spent the night in a shed. They
   had made long detours and had, I believe, paid many visits. I think
   they spent three days on their journey. Except this I have forgotten
   almost everything.

   [On July 13 ^th she said:] I saw Joseph once more in his house
   yesterday, Wednesday the 12 ^th. He seems to have gone straight home
   without passing through Jerusalem. Anna's maidservant is looking after
   everything for him and keeps going to and fro between his house and
   Anna's. Otherwise Joseph was alone. I saw Zechariah coming home again.
   As always, I saw Mary and Elizabeth reciting the Magnificat in prayer
   and working together. Towards evening they walked in the garden, where
   there was a fountain, which is unusual here; they always had a little
   jug of juice with them. Towards evening, when it grew cool, they
   generally went for a walk in the country round, for Zechariah's house
   was isolated and surrounded by meadows. They usually went to bed at
   nine o'clock, but always got up before sunrise.

   [This is all that Catherine Emmerich communicated of her visions of the
   Blessed Virgin's visit to Elizabeth. It should be noticed that she
   described this event on the occasion of the Feast of the Visitation at
   the beginning of July, but that the actual visit probably took place in
   March, since she saw the message of the Incarnation being given to the
   Blessed Virgin already on February 25 ^th, and closely followed by the
   Blessed Virgin's journey to Elizabeth. That journey was, according to
   Catherine Emmerich, undertaken when Joseph went to attend the Passover,
   which began on the 14 ^th of the month Nisan, corresponding to our
   month of March.

3. THE BIRTH OF JOHN. MARY RETURNS TO NAZARETH.

   [On June 9 ^th, 1821, Catherine Emmerich discovered near her a relic of
   Christ's disciple Parmenas, and amongst other visions having reference
   to this saint she communicated the following, which belongs to this
   portion of her narrative.]

   After the Blessed Virgin's return from Juttah to Nazareth I saw her
   spending several days in the house of the parents of Parmenas, Our
   Lord's future disciple, who was not yet born. [88] I think I saw this
   at the same time of year as it actually happened. I had that impression
   during my vision. In that case the birth of John the Baptist would have
   happened at the end of May or the beginning of June. Mary stayed for
   three months with Elizabeth, until after the birth of John, but was not
   present on the occasion of his circumcision. [Owing to interruptions,
   Catherine Emmerich did not relate anything further about John's birth
   or circumcision, and we therefore refer the reader to the words of the
   Gospel ( St. Luke 1.57-80).]

   The Blessed Virgin returned home to Nazareth after John's birth and
   before his circumcision. Joseph came to meet her-half-way. [Catherine
   Emmerich was so ill and agitated that she did not tell who accompanied
   the Blessed Virgin till then, nor did she mention the place where she
   met Joseph. Perhaps this was Dothan, where they stayed on their journey
   to Elizabeth with the friend of Joseph's father. She was no doubt
   accompanied there by relations of Zechariah or by friends from Nazareth
   who were undertaking the same journey. What follows may be taken as
   confirming this supposition.]

   When Joseph traveled back with the Blessed Virgin during the second
   half of her journey from Juttah to Nazareth, he noticed from her figure
   that she was with child, and was sore beset by trouble and doubt, for
   he knew nothing of the Angel's annunciation to the Blessed Virgin.
   Immediately after his marriage, Joseph had gone to Bethlehem to arrange
   about some inheritance; in the meantime Mary had gone to Nazareth with
   her parents and some of her play-fellows. The angelic salutation
   happened before Joseph returned to Nazareth. Mary in shy humility had
   kept God's secret to herself. Joseph, though greatly disquieted by what
   he had perceived, said nothing, but struggled in silence with his
   doubts. [89] The Blessed Virgin, who had foreseen this trouble, became
   thoughtful and serious, which only increased St. Joseph's uneasiness.
   When they came to Nazareth, I saw that the Blessed Virgin did not at
   once go into Joseph's house with him, but spent a few days with
   relations. These were the parents of a son, Parmenas (not yet born),
   who became a disciple of Jesus and was one of the seven deacons in the
   first community of Christians in Jerusalem. These people were related
   to the Holy Family, for the mother was a sister of the third husband of
   Mary Cleophas, the father of Simeon, bishop of Jerusalem. They had a
   house and a garden of spices in Nazareth. They were also related to the
   Holy Family through Elizabeth. I saw that the Blessed Virgin stayed for
   several days with these people before she came to Joseph's house.
   Joseph's uneasiness increased, however, to such an extent that, now
   that Mary was preparing to return to him in his house, he made up his
   mind to leave her and to disappear in secret. While he was harboring
   this thought, an Angel appeared to him in a dream and reassured him.

   [83] Catherine Emmerich saw Jesus at Dothan in this house on Nov. 2nd
   (the 12th day of the month Marcheswan) of the thirty-first year of His
   Life. He was healing the dropsy of Issachar, the fifty-year-old husband
   of the daughter of this family, whose name was Salome. On that occasion
   Issachar spoke of the visit of Joseph and Mary here mentioned. The
   descendant of David whose name is given uncertainly by Catherine
   Emmerich as Eldoa or Eldad, and whom she describes as being the link
   between Joseph's and Salome's families, might perhaps have been Elioda
   or Eliada, a son of David's, mentioned in 2 Kings 5.16, and in 1
   Chronicles 3.8. Although it may seem natural that Catherine Emmerich
   should confuse various name-sounds, such confusion should not
   necessarily always be assumed. Hebrew proper names have a very definite
   signification; but since the same signification can be conveyed in
   speaking by several different expressions, one person may often bear
   different names. Thus we find a son of David's sometimes called Elishua
   (God helps') and sometimes Elishama (God hears'); and Eldea or Eldaa
   may mean God comes' just as much as Eliada. The uncertain mention of
   this descendant of David's as being also a king need not surprise us,
   for there can be no doubt that David's sons or descendants administered
   the government in the vassal states. (CB) The Vulgate forms of the name
   of David's son are Elisua in 2 Kings. ( Sam.) 5.15, and Elisama in 1
   Chr. 3.6. In Hebrew, Elishua (God saves') and Elishama (God hears').
   The name of the son Elioda or Eliada is in both places Elyada, which
   with its by-forms means God knows', (SB)

   [84] A learned friend tells me that this flower is probably the
   cypress-cluster (Lawsonia spinosa inermis, Linn.) mentioned in the
   Canticle of Canticles, 1.13: A cluster of cypress my love is to me in
   the vineyards of Engaddi.' Mariti, in his journey through Syria and
   Palestine, mentions this shrub and its flowers in the region here
   traversed by the Blessed Virgin. He describes the leaves as smaller and
   more delicate than those of the myrtle; the flowers are, he says,
   rose-red and the flower-cluster shaped like a bunch of grapes. This
   agrees with the general description given by Catherine Emmerich. (CB)

   [85] The message of Isaiah which she has forgotten is beyond doubt his

   [86] AC expresses surprise at Zechariah's release from dumbness, but
   this was presumably temporary and by miraculous intervention--the

   the child. (SB)

   [87] His feast is on July 6th (the day when Catherine Emmerich made
   this communication), a fact unknown at the time to the writer. When he
   learnt it later by a casual glance at the calendar, he received a fresh
   confirmation of the organic connection of all her visions with the

             X. THE CENSUS AND THE JOURNEY OF THE HOLY FAMILY [90]

1. THE CENSUS OF THE EMPEROR AUGUSTUS IS PROCLAIMED. CHRIST'S BIRTH IN NOVEMBER.

   The actual date of Christ's Birth, as I always see it, is four weeks
   earlier than its celebration by the Church; it must have happened on
   St. Catherine's feast day. I always see the Annunciation as happening
   at the end of February. Already at the end of October, I saw it being
   announced in the Promised Land that an enrollment and taxing of the
   people was to be made by decree of the Emperor. After that I saw many
   people traveling up and down the country.

2. ST. ANNE'S HOUSE IN NAZARETH. PREPARING FOR CHRIST'S BIRTH.

   [Sunday, November 11 ^th, 1821:] For several days in succession I have
   seen the Blessed Virgin with her mother Anna, whose house is about an
   hour's journey away from Nazareth in the valley of Zabulon. The only
   woman remaining in the Blessed Virgin's house at Nazareth is Anna's
   maidservant, who looks after St. Joseph while Mary is with Anna. In
   fact, as long as Anna was alive they had no completely separate
   household, but always received their provisions from her. For several
   weeks already I have seen the Blessed Virgin busy with preparations for
   the Birth of Christ. She is sewing and knitting coverlets, cloths, and
   swaddling-bands. There is more than enough of everything.

   Joachim is no longer alive; I see another man in the house. Anna has
   married again. Her second husband was employed in the Temple in
   connection with the beasts for sacrifice. I saw Anna sending him out
   food when he was with the flocks and herds; there were little loaves
   and fishes in a leathern wallet with several divisions in it. There is
   a rather tall little girl, about seven years old, in the house, who
   helps the Blessed Virgin and is taught by her. I think she might be a
   daughter of Mary Cleophas. Her name was Mary, too. Joseph is not at
   Nazareth, but must soon be coming, for he is on his way back from
   Jerusalem, where he has taken beasts for sacrifice.

   I saw the Blessed Virgin in the house. She was far advanced in
   pregnancy, and sat in a room working with several other women. They
   were preparing coverlets and other things for Mary's confinement. Anna,
   who possessed pastures with flocks and herds, was well-to-do. She
   supplied the Blessed Virgin with plenty of everything that it was
   customary for a person in her rank of life to have. As she thought that
   Mary would be in her (Anna's) house for the birth of her child, and
   that all her relations would come to visit her there, she made all the
   preparations in a very lavish manner, with specially beautiful
   coverlets and rugs. I saw a coverlet of the kind that was in
   Elizabeth's house when John was born. It was embroidered with all kinds
   of texts and emblems, and had a kind of inner lining sewn into it in
   which the mother could wrap herself. She could fasten this lining round
   her with tapes and buttons, and be as it were in a little boat or like
   a baby in its swaddling-bands. She could recline comfortably in it,
   supported by cushions, when visited by friends, and the latter sat
   round her on the edge of the coverlet. All these things, as well as
   many swaddling-bands for the child itself, were prepared in Anna's
   house. I saw gold and silver threads being used. Not all the coverlets
   and other things were for Mary's own use; much was intended as presents
   for the poor, who were always remembered on happy occasions of this
   kind. I saw the Blessed Virgin and other women sitting on the floor
   round a big chest, knitting and working at a big coverlet lying in the
   chest between them. They used two little sticks on which colored
   threads were wound. Anna was very busy; she went here and there
   fetching and distributing wool and apportioning their tasks to her
   maidservants.

3. JOSEPH IS TOLD TO TRAVEL WITH MARY TO BETHLEHEM.

   [November 12 ^th:] Joseph will arrive back in Nazareth today. He was in
   Jerusalem, taking beasts there for sacrifice. He left them at the
   little inn a quarter of an hour on the road from Jerusalem to
   Bethlehem. The house was kept by a devout old childless couple. It was
   a suitable lodging for quiet people. Joseph went from there to
   Bethlehem, but did not visit his relations in that town. He only wanted
   to find out about an enrolment and taxation of the people which made it
   necessary for everyone to betake himself to his birthplace. He did not,
   however, have himself inscribed as yet, because he intended to journey
   with Mary to the Temple in Jerusalem after the days of her
   purification, and then to go to Bethlehem and settle there. I do not
   know for certain what were his reasons, but Joseph did not like being
   in Nazareth. [91] He therefore looked about him in Bethlehem and made
   inquiries about stones and timber, for he had it in his mind to build
   himself a house there. Having found out what he wanted, he returned to
   the inn near Jerusalem, took his sacrifice to the Temple, and hurried
   home again.

   As he was crossing the field of Chimki, [92] six hours from Nazareth,
   at midnight last night, an angel appeared to him and warned him that he
   was to go to Bethlehem with Mary at once, for it was there that she was
   to bear her child. He also indicated everything that she was to take
   with her for her use, explaining that they were to be few and simple
   things, and in particular no embroidered coverlets. Also, besides the
   ass upon which Mary was to sit, he was to take with him a she-ass one
   year old that had not yet had a foal. He was to let her run free and
   was always to follow whatever path she took. This evening Anna went
   with the Blessed Virgin to Nazareth; no doubt they knew that Joseph was
   arriving. But they do not seem to know that Mary would journey to
   Bethlehem from Anna's house. They thought no doubt that Mary would bear
   her child in her own house in Nazareth, for I saw them taking there,
   packed in saddle-bags, many of the things they had prepared. I saw
   amongst them several shawls of blue material with hoods. I think they
   were meant for wrapping the child in. Joseph arrived at Nazareth in the
   evening.

4. JOSEPH REVEALS TO MARY THE ANGEL'S COMMANDMENT.

   [November 13 ^th:] Today I saw the Blessed Virgin and her mother Anna
   in the house in Nazareth, where Joseph revealed to them what had been
   told him the previous night. Thereupon they returned to Anna's house,
   and I saw them preparing to leave immediately. Anna was distressed. The
   Blessed Virgin must have known that she was to bear her child in
   Bethlehem, but had been silent out of humility. She knew it from the
   writings of the Prophets about the birth of the Messiah, all of which
   she treasured in her little cupboard at Nazareth. (She had been given
   them by her women-teachers in the Temple and had been instructed in
   them by these holy women. She used to read them very often and pray for
   their fulfillment. Her prayers were ever full of yearning for the
   coming of the Messiah; she ever extolled as blessed her who should bear
   the holy child, and hoped only to be allowed to serve her as her lowest
   maidservant. Never in her humility had she thought that she herself
   might be the chosen one.) Since she knew from those passages in the
   Prophets that the Savior was to be born in Bethlehem, she yielded
   joyfully to the Divine Will and began the journey, which was difficult
   for her at that time of the year, when it was often decidedly cold in
   the valleys between the ranges of hills.

5. ON THE JOURNEY TO BETHLEHEM

   This evening I saw Joseph and the Blessed Virgin, accompanied by Anna,
   Mary Cleophas, and some menservants, starting off from Anna's house.
   Mary sat on the comfortable side-saddle of a donkey, which also carried
   her baggage. Joseph led the donkey. A second donkey was taken for Anna
   to ride back on. Her husband was away in the fields when they started
   on their journey.

  5.1 THE FIELD GINIM. THE TRAVELERS ARE GIVEN A YOUNG SHE-ASS FROM ANNA'S
  PASTURE.

   [November 14 ^th:] This morning I saw the holy travelers arrive at an
   open field called Ginim, [93] six hours' journey from Nazareth, where
   the angel had appeared to Joseph two days before. Anna had a pasture
   here and the menservants were told to fetch the young she-ass which
   Joseph was to take with him. She sometimes ran in front of them and
   sometimes beside them. Anna and Mary Cleophas here took a tender
   farewell of the travelers and returned home with the menservants.

   (This field Ginim is several miles long and is shaped like a pear.
   Another field, called Gimmi, lies nearer Nazareth not far from a
   shepherds' village high up in the hills called Gimmi or Gimchi, where
   Jesus taught shepherds from the 7 ^th to the 9 ^th of September before
   His Baptism. These shepherds had lepers hidden among them. He also
   healed here the dropsical woman of the house where He stayed, and was
   mocked by the Pharisees. Farther away from this place and to the
   south-west of Nazareth, beyond the river Kishon, is a settlement of
   lepers, consisting of scattered huts round a lake formed by the river.
   Jesus healed here on September 30 ^th before His Baptism. The field
   Ginim, traversed today by the Holy Family, is separated from the other
   field Gimmi by a little river or river-bed. The names are so alike that
   I may easily have confused them.)

   I saw the Holy Family going on their way and climbing Mount Gilboa.
   [94] They did not pass through any town; they followed the young
   she-ass, which always took lonely by-ways. I saw them stopping at a
   house in the hills belonging to Lazarus, not far from the town of Ginim
   and in the direction of Samaria. The steward, who knew them from other
   journeys, gave them a friendly welcome. Their family was on intimate
   terms with Lazarus. There are beautiful orchards and avenues here. The
   house stands high, so that one has a very wide view from the roof.
   Lazarus inherited it from his father; our Lord Jesus often stayed here
   during His ministry and taught in the surrounding country. The steward
   and his wife conversed in a very friendly way with the Blessed Virgin.
   They were surprised that she should have been willing to undertake such
   a long journey in her condition, when she might have had every comfort
   at home with her mother Anna.

  5.2 TRAVELING AT NIGHT. MARY AND JOSEPH REST AT THE TEREBINTH OF ABRAHAM.

   [Thursday to Friday night, November 15 ^th-16 ^th:] I saw the Holy
   Family some hours' journey beyond this last place, going at night
   towards a mountain through a very cold valley. It looked as if there
   was hoar-frost on the ground. The Blessed Virgin was suffering from the
   cold and said to Joseph: We must rest, I can go no farther.' Hardly had
   she spoken when the she-ass that was running with them stood still
   under a terebinth tree, very big and old, near which was a spring of
   water. They stopped under this tree; Joseph spread coverings for the
   Blessed Virgin to sit on, after helping her to alight from the donkey,
   and she sat down under the tree. Joseph hung a lighted lantern, which
   he carried with him, on the lower branches of the tree. (I often saw
   travelers in that country do this at night.) The Blessed Virgin prayed
   earnestly to God that He would not suffer her to take harm from the
   cold. At once she was filled with so great a warmth that she held out
   her hands to St. Joseph to warm his. They refreshed themselves here
   with fruit and little loaves of bread which they had with them, and
   drank water from the spring near by, mixing it with balsam which Joseph
   had brought with him in a little jug. Joseph spoke very comfortingly to
   the Blessed Virgin: he is so good, and so sorry that the journey is so
   difficult. When the Blessed Virgin complained of the cold, he spoke to
   her about the good lodging which he hoped to find for her in Bethlehem.
   He said he knew of a house with very good people where they would find
   a comfortable lodging at very little cost. It was, he said, better to
   pay something than to be taken in for nothing. He spoke highly of
   Bethlehem in general, and comforted the Blessed Virgin in every
   possible way. (This upset me, because I knew well that things would
   turn out quite differently. Even this holy man, you see, indulged in
   human hopes.)

   So far they have crossed two little streams in the course of their
   journey: one of these they crossed on a high foot-way, while the two
   donkeys waded through the water. It was strange to see how the young
   she-ass, who was free to go where she would, kept running round the
   travelers. Where the path narrowed, as for instance between hills, and
   so could not be mistaken, she ran sometimes before and sometimes behind
   them, but where there was a parting of the ways she always appeared
   again and took the right path. Where they were to rest, she stood
   still, as here by the terebinth tree. I do not remember whether they
   spent the night under the tree, or whether they went on to another
   shelter.

   This terebinth was a very old and sacred tree, of the grove of Moreh
   near Shechem. When Abraham was journeying into the land of Canaan, he
   had here a vision of God, who promised him this land for his
   descendants. ( Gen. 15.) He then built an altar under the terebinth.
   Before Jacob went to Bethel, to sacrifice to the Lord, he buried under
   this terebinth all the strange gods of Laban and the jewels which his
   family carried with him. ( Gen. 35.4.) Under this tree Joshua built the
   tabernacle for the Ark of the Covenant and made the people assembled
   there renounce their idols. ( Joshua 24.26.) It was here that
   Abimelech, the son of Gideon, was hailed as king of the Shechemites. (
   Judges 9.6.)

  5.3 TWO HOURS SOUTH OF THE TEREBINTH TREE. THEY REST IN AN EMPTY SHED.

   [November 16 ^th:] I saw the Holy Family spending the whole day here
   and praying together. I saw the mistress of the house and her three
   children with the Blessed Virgin, and the farmer's wife of the day
   before also came with her two children and paid the Blessed Virgin a
   visit. There was real intimacy among them as they sat together, and the
   two women were greatly impressed by Mary's wisdom and modest behavior.
   They listened with great attention to the Blessed Virgin, who talked
   much with the children and taught them. The children had little
   parchment rolls from which Mary made them read to her. She spoke to
   them in such a lovely way about what they read that they could not take
   their eyes off her. It was sweet to see and sweeter still to hear. In
   the afternoon I saw St. Joseph walking about with the innkeeper in the
   country round, looking at the gardens and fields, and talking of holy
   things, as I saw was always the Sabbath practice of devout people in
   that land. They remained here for the following night as well.

  5.5 THEY TRAVEL FURTHER SOUTH-EAST. THEY SEE THE TEMPLE ON MOUNT GARIZIM.

   [Sunday, November 18 ^th:] The good people of this inn have become
   extremely fond of the Blessed Virgin, and have an intense sympathy with
   her and with her condition. They begged her in the most friendly way to
   stay and await her confinement here. They even showed her a comfortable
   room which they would make ready for her. The woman offered her, with
   all her heart, to care for her and look after her in every way.
   However, they started again on their journey early in the morning, and
   went down a valley on the south-eastern side of the mountains. They
   went farther away from Samaria, towards which the first part of their
   journey seemed to be directed. As they descended the hill, they could
   see the temple on Mount Garizim, which is visible from a great
   distance. There are many figures of lions or other animals on the roof
   which gleam white in the sunshine. I saw them traveling about six hours
   today, and towards evening I saw them arrive at a large shepherd's
   house in a field, where they were well received. This was about an
   hour's journey to the south-east of Shechem.

   The man of the house was a steward of the orchards and fields belonging
   to the neighboring town. The house was not right down in the plain, but
   on a slope. All the country here was better and more fertile than
   during the first part of their journey, for this was the sunny side,
   and in the Promised Land at this time of year that makes a considerable
   difference. Between here and Bethlehem lay many other shepherds'
   dwellings, scattered about in the intersecting valleys. The people here
   belonged to those shepherds whose daughters later married some of the
   followers of the three holy kings who remained behind when their
   masters left. From one of these marriages came a boy who was healed by
   Our Lord in this house at the Blessed Virgin's request in the second
   year of His ministry, on July 31 ^st (the 7 ^th day of the month Ab)
   after He had talked with the Samaritan woman. Jesus took him with two
   other youths as companions on His journey to Arabia, after the raising
   of Lazarus, and afterwards he became a disciple. Jesus often stayed
   here and taught. There were children in the house, and Joseph blessed
   them before he went away.

   [November 19 ^th:] Today I saw them traveling in more level country.
   The Blessed Virgin sometimes goes on foot. They often stop to rest and
   refresh themselves. They have little loaves with them, and a drink
   which is both cooling and strengthening. This is contained in
   delicately made little jugs shining like bronze, with two ears. It is
   balsam, which they mix with water. They sometimes pick berries and
   fruits which may still be found hanging in sunny places on the trees
   and bushes. Mary's saddle on the donkey has a foot-rest hanging on each
   side, so that her feet do not hang down as is usual in our country. She
   sits sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left of the
   pack-donkey, which moves very quietly and evenly. Joseph's first
   action, whenever they rest by the way or stop for the night, is to make
   ready a comfortable place for the Blessed Virgin to sit and rest. He
   often washes his feet, and Mary does the same. They have the habit of
   washing often.

   It was already dark when they came to a house standing by itself.
   Joseph knocked at the door and asked for lodging. The master of the
   house refused, however, to open, and when Joseph explained Mary's
   condition and said that she could go no farther, adding that he was not
   asking for lodging without payment, the hard-hearted man retorted
   angrily that his house was not an inn, and that he wanted to be left
   alone and not disturbed by knocking, which he could not bear. He told
   Joseph to go on his way, and was so relentless that he did not even
   open the door, but shouted his harsh words from behind it. So they went
   on a little way and turned into a shed where they found the she-ass
   standing. Joseph kindled a light and prepared a bed for the Blessed
   Virgin, with her help. He brought the pack-donkey in, too, and found
   some straw and fodder for him. They prayed, took some refreshment, and
   slept for a few hours. It must be about six hours' journey from the
   last inn to this place. They must be some twenty-six hours from
   Nazareth and ten from Jerusalem. Until now they have not taken any
   high-roads, but have cut across several trade-roads leading from the
   Jordan to Samaria and running into the highways which go from Syria to
   Egypt. The by-roads which they took are very small, and in the
   mountains sometimes so narrow that a man must pick his way very
   carefully so as not to stumble. The donkeys, however, are very
   sure-footed. Their shelter here was on level ground.

  5.6 BETWEEN SAMARIA AND JUDEA. THE FRUITLESS FIG TREE NORTH-EAST OF BETHANY.

   [November 20 ^th:] The day had not yet broken when they left this
   place. Their way led uphill again. I think they were near the road
   leading from Gabara [95] to Jerusalem and that the frontier between
   Samaria and Judea was here. They were again roughly refused admission
   at another house. When they were several hours north-east of Bethany,
   it happened that Mary was greatly in need of rest and refreshment; so
   Joseph turned off the road for about half an hour to a place where he
   knew there was a beautiful fig tree, which as a rule was full of fruit.
   This tree had benches round it for people to rest on. Joseph knew it
   from a former journey. When, however, they got there, they found no
   fruit at all on the tree, which distressed them very much. I have a dim
   recollection that afterwards Jesus had something to do with this tree.
   It never bore fruit any more, but was green, and I think that the Lord
   cursed it as He passed by when escaping from Jerusalem and that it
   withered away. [96] After this they came to a house where the man was
   at first very harsh to Joseph when he humbly asked him for lodging. He
   shone his light onto the Blessed Virgin's face and scoffed at Joseph
   for taking so young a woman about with him; he was, he supposed,
   jealous. The woman of the house then came up and took pity on the
   Blessed Virgin, showing her a room in a side-building in a very
   friendly way, and bringing little loaves of bread for them to eat. The
   man, too, was sorry for his rudeness, and became very friendly towards
   the holy travelers. After this they came to a third house. It was
   inhabited by young people, but I saw an old man with a stick walking
   about in it. Their reception here was tolerably good but not
   particularly friendly. Nobody took much trouble about them. The people
   here were not real simple shepherds; they were like rich peasants with
   us who are more or less entangled in the world and in trade and so on.
   Jesus visited one of these houses on October 20 ^th (the first day of
   the month Tisri) after His Baptism, and found the resting-place of His
   parents decorated and used as a praying-place. I am not sure whether it
   was the one where the man had at first jeered at Joseph. I have a dim
   remembrance that the people there had arranged it like this immediately
   after the wonders accompanying His Birth. Towards the end of their road
   Joseph made many halts, for the journey grew more and more difficult
   for the Blessed Virgin. They followed the way taken by the she-ass, and
   made a day and a half's detour eastwards of Jerusalem. Joseph's father
   had owned pastureland round here, so he knew the country very well. If
   they had traveled due south, across the desert behind Bethany, they
   would probably have reached Bethlehem in six hours, but that way was
   hilly and at that time of year very difficult; so the she-ass led them
   through valleys which brought them nearer to the Jordan.

  5.7 THEY STOP AT A SHEPHERD'S LARGE HOUSE.

   [November 21 ^st:] Today I saw the holy travelers entering a big
   shepherd's house while it was still full day. This must be about three
   hours from John's baptizing place on the Jordan and about seven hours
   from Bethlehem. It is the same house in which thirty years later Jesus
   spent the night of October 11 ^th before the morning on which he passed
   near the Baptist for the first time after His Baptism. Near the house,
   and apart from it, was a shed in which were kept the agricultural
   implements and the shepherd's things. In the court was a fountain with
   baths round it, supplied with water from the fountain by pipes. The
   master of the house must have owned much land; it was a large
   establishment. I saw many menservants coming and going and having their
   meals there. The master of the house received the travelers in a very
   friendly way and was very ready to help. They were shown a comfortable
   room, and their pack-donkey was well looked after. A manservant was
   told to wash Joseph's feet at the fountain and to give him other
   clothes while his own were cleaned from dust and smoothed out. A maid
   did the same for the Blessed Virgin. They ate and slept here. The
   mistress of the house was rather perverse in character. She lived in a
   separate room and kept herself apart. She had surreptitiously examined
   the travelers, and as she was young and vain she was vexed by the
   beauty of the Blessed Virgin: she was also afraid that Mary might
   appeal to her to let her stay and be confined there, so she kept away
   in a hostile spirit and insisted that they should leave the next day.
   (This is the same woman whom Jesus found there in this house, blind and
   crippled, thirty years later on October 11 ^th, after His Baptism.
   After reproaching her for her inhospitality and vanity, He healed her.)
   There were also children in the house. The Holy Family spent the night
   here.

  5.8 A HOUSE OWNED BY JOSEPH'S RELATIVES. THEY STAY AT AN INN CONDUCTING A
  FUNERAL.

   [November 22 ^nd:] I saw the Holy Family leaving their place of shelter
   about midday. Some of the inmates of the house accompanied them for
   part of their way. After a short journey of about two hours westward
   they came to a place where scattered houses, with gardens and
   forecourts, stand in a long row on either side of a main road. Some
   relations of Joseph's lived here. They were, as far as I remember, sons
   by a second marriage of a stepfather or stepmother. I saw the house; it
   had a good situation and was quite large. They went, however, right
   through this place, and then turned right for half an hour, in the
   direction of Jerusalem, until they reached a large inn, in the court of
   which there was a big fountain with many pipes. A large company was
   assembled here, attending a funeral. The interior of the house, in the
   center of which was the fireplace and its chimney, had been made into
   one large ball by the removal of the low wooden screens which at other
   times divided it into separate rooms. Black curtains hung behind the
   hearth, in front of which stood a veiled black object like a coffin. A
   large assembly of men were praying round it. They wore long black
   garments with short white ones over them, and some had black fringed
   maniples hanging on one arm. In another room women completely veiled
   were sitting on the floor in low boxes and mourning.

   The owners of the inn themselves, who were busy with the funeral,
   welcomed the travelers only from a distance. The servants of the house,
   however, gave them a very friendly reception and showed them every
   attention. A separate lodging was prepared for them by letting down
   mats which had been rolled up to the ceiling, so that they were in a
   kind of tent. There were many beds in this house rolled up against the
   wall, and mats could be let down to make many separate cells.
   Afterwards I saw the people of the house visiting the Holy Family and
   conversing with them in a friendly manner. They no longer wore the
   white garments over their black' ones. After Joseph and Mary had
   refreshed themselves and taken a little food, they prayed together and
   retired to rest.

  5.9 THE LAST STRETCH OF ROAD TOWARDS BETHLEHEM. THE GOODWILL OF THE INN
  OWNERS.

   [November 23 ^rd:] Joseph and Mary left here for Bethlehem about
   midday. They still had some three hours' journey before them. The
   mistress of the house urged them to stay where they were, for, she
   said, it seemed to her that Mary might be delivered at any moment.
   Mary, however, dropping her veil, said that she had still thirty-six
   hours before her. (I am not sure that she did not say thirty-eight.)
   The woman was very anxious to keep her, not in the house itself, but in
   another building. As they left, I saw Joseph talking to the innkeeper
   about his donkeys. He spoke very highly of them, and said he had
   brought the she-ass with him in order to pawn her in case of necessity.

   When the people of the house spoke of the difficulty of finding lodging
   in Bethlehem, Joseph said he had friends there and would certainly be
   well received. (It makes me always so sorry when he talks so certainly
   of being well received. He talked to Mary in that way, too, as they
   went along. One sees by this that even such holy people can be
   mistaken.)

6. THE ARRIVAL OF THE HOLY FAMILY IN BETHLEHEM.

   The journey from the last inn to Bethlehem must have taken about three
   hours. They made a circuit round the north side of Bethlehem and
   approached the town from the west. They made a halt under a tree some
   little way off the road. Mary alighted from the donkey and arranged her
   clothing, after which Joseph went with her to a large building a few
   minutes outside Bethlehem, surrounded by courtyards and other small
   buildings. There were trees in front of it, and round about it were
   crowds encamped in tents. This was the old ancestral house of David and
   once Joseph's family home. Relations or acquaintances of Joseph's still
   lived there, but they treated him as a stranger and as a person whom
   they did not want to know. This house was now being used for the
   receipt of the money from the Roman taxation. Joseph, leading the
   donkey by the bridle, went at once to this house with the Blessed
   Virgin, because every new arrival had to report himself here and was
   given a paper, without which he could not be admitted into Bethlehem.

   [After several pauses Catherine Emmerich spoke as follows in her
   visionary state:] The young she-ass that runs free has not gone with
   them here, she has run off round the outside of the town towards the
   south, where it is flatter and there is a sort of open valley. Joseph
   has gone into the house. Mary is with some women in a little house
   beside the courtyard: they are very friendly to her and are giving her
   some food. These women are cooking for the soldiers. They are Roman
   soldiers, with strips of leather hanging round their loins. The weather
   here is very pleasant and not at all cold. The hill between Jerusalem
   and Bethany is in full sunshine; one has a fine view of it from here.
   Joseph is in a big room with an uneven floor. They are asking him who
   he is and are referring to long scrolls of which a great many are
   hanging on the walls. They unroll them and read aloud to him his
   ancestry and also Mary's: he did not seem to know that she also
   descended so directly from David through Joachim; he himself descended
   from an earlier offspring of David's. The man asks him: Where is your
   wife?' Owing to many disorders the people of the country have not been
   properly registered for seven years. [97] I see the figures V and II,
   making seven [she forms this figure with her fingers]. This taxation
   has been going on for several months. Some payments were made here and
   there during those seven years, but nothing regular. The people were
   made to pay twice over. Some of them stayed here for as long as three
   months. Joseph came rather late to the tax office, but was treated in
   quite a friendly way. He has not paid anything yet, but was asked about
   his means, and stated that he had no land and lived by his handicraft
   and from the assistance given him by his wife's mother.

   There are a great number of scribes and high officials in many of the
   rooms. On the upper floors are Romans and many soldiers. There are also
   present Pharisees and Sadducees, priests, elders and every kind of
   official and scribe, both Jewish and Roman. There is no such commission
   in Jerusalem, but they are established in several other places, such as
   Magdala on the sea of Galilee, where the inhabitants of Galilee are
   taxed, and also those of Sidon, I think because of their commercial
   dealings. Only the people who are not resident anywhere and have no
   land on which they can be taxed have to present themselves at their
   birthplace. From now on the tax has to be paid in three months in three
   installments. Each of these three installments goes to a different
   object. The first is shared by the Emperor Augustus, Herod, and another
   king who lives near Egypt. He has rendered some service in war and has
   a right to a district up in the north, so they have to apportion
   something to him. The second installment has to do with the building of
   the Temple; it seems as if it were used to pay off a debt. The third
   installment is intended for widows and poor people, who have had
   nothing for a long time, but of all this little reaches the right
   people, just as happens today. The money is meant for nothing but good
   causes, and yet remains in the hands of the great. All this business of
   writing made a terrible fuss and commotion.

   Joseph was now allowed to go, and when he got downstairs the Blessed
   Virgin was called before the scribes in a passage, but they did not
   read anything aloud to her. They told Joseph that it was unnecessary
   for him to have brought his wife with him, and seemed to be bantering
   him on account of her youth. Joseph was ashamed of this being said
   before Mary; he was afraid she might think that he was not respected in
   his birthplace.

7. SEEKING LODGING IN BETHLEHEM.

   After this they went on into Bethlehem, the buildings of which were at
   some distance from each other. The entrance was through ruined walls as
   if the gate had been destroyed. Mary remained with the donkey at the
   very entrance of the street while Joseph sought a lodging in the
   nearest houses--in vain, for Bethlehem was full of strangers, all
   running from place to place. Joseph returned to Mary, saying that as no
   shelter was to be found there, they would go on farther into the town.
   He led the donkey on by the bridle, and the Blessed Virgin walked
   beside him. When they came to the beginning of another street, Mary
   again stopped by the donkey, and Joseph again went from house to house
   in vain seeking a lodging, and again came sadly back. This happened
   several times, and the Blessed Virgin often had long to wait.
   Everywhere the houses were filled with people, everywhere he was turned
   away, so he said to Mary that they would go to another part of
   Bethlehem where they would surely find lodging. They went a little way
   back in the direction in which they had come and then turned
   southwards. They went hesitatingly through the street, which was more
   like a country road, for the houses were built on slopes. Here, too,
   their search was fruitless. On the other side of Bethlehem, where the
   houses lie farther apart, they came to a lower-lying open space, like a
   field, where it was more solitary. There was a sort of shed here and,
   not far from it, a great spreading tree, with shady branches like a big
   lime-tree. The trunk was smooth and the spreading branches made a kind
   of roof. Joseph led the Blessed Virgin to this tree, and made her a
   comfortable seat against its trunk with their bundles, so that she
   might rest while he sought for shelter in the houses near. The donkey
   stood with its head turned towards the tree. At first Mary stood
   upright, leaning against the tree. Her ample white woolen dress had no
   girdle and hung round her in folds: her head was covered with a white
   veil. Many people passed by and looked at her, not knowing that the
   Redeemer was so near to them. She was so patient, so humble, so full of
   hopeful expectation. Ah, she had to wait a long, long time; she sat
   down at last on the rug, crossing her feet under her. She sat with her
   head bent and her hands crossed below her breast.

   Joseph came back to her in great distress; he had found no shelter. His
   friends, of whom he had spoken to the Blessed Virgin, would hardly
   recognize him. He was in tears and Mary comforted him. He went once
   more from one house to another; but as he gave the approaching
   confinement of his wife as his chief reason for his request, he met
   with even more decided refusals. Although the place was solitary, the
   passersby at last began to stand still and look curiously at the
   Blessed Virgin from a distance, as one may well do if one sees somebody
   waiting in the dusk for a long time. I think some of them even spoke to
   her, asking her who she was. At last Joseph came back. He was so upset
   that he came up hesitatingly. He said he had had no success, but he
   knew of one place outside the town, belonging to the shepherds, who
   often went there when coming with their flocks to the town. There they
   would, in any case, find a shelter. He said that he knew the place from
   childhood; when his brothers had tormented him, he had often escaped
   there to hide from them and to say his prayers. Even if the shepherds
   did come there, he would easily come to an understanding with them; but
   at this time of year they were seldom there. As soon as he had settled
   her there in peace and quiet, he would look round again for something
   else. They then went outside Bethlehem to the east of the town by a
   lonely footpath, going to the left. It was like a path along the ruined
   walls, ditches, and banks of some little town. At first, the path
   ascended slightly, and then, descended after crossing a hill. On the
   east of the town, a few minutes outside it, they came to a hill or high
   bank, in front of which was an open space made pleasant by several
   trees. There were pine-trees (cedar or terebinth) and other trees with
   small leaves like our box-trees. The place was such as one might find
   right at the end of the old ramparts of some little town.

   [In order to avoid continually interrupting the narrative, we will here
   describe as fully as possible the surroundings of this hill and the
   interior of the Cave of the Nativity according to the repeated accounts
   given by Catherine Emmerich.]

8. DESCRIPTION OF THE CAVE OF THE NATIVITY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS.

   [From the following description, we have constructed a floor plan of
   the room of the Cave of the Nativity. Please refer to Figure 12.]

   Among many other different grottoes or cave-dwellings there was, at the
   south end of this hill, round which the road wound its way to the
   Shepherd's Valley, the cave in which Joseph sought shelter for the
   Blessed Virgin. From the west the entrance [Figure 12, part 1] led
   eastwards into the hill through a narrow passage into a larger chamber,
   half semicircular and half triangular. The walls of the cave were of
   the natural rock, and only on the south side, which was encircled by
   the road to the shepherd's valley, was it completed by a little rough
   masonry. On this south side was another entrance [Figure 12, part 5]
   into the cave, but this was generally blocked up, and Joseph had to
   clear it before he could use it. If you came out of this entrance and
   turned to the left, you came upon a wider entrance into a lower vault
   [Figure 12, part 11], narrow and inconvenient, which stretched under
   the Cave of the Nativity. From the ordinary entrance to the cave, which
   faced westwards, one could see nothing but a few roofs and towers of
   Bethlehem. If you turned to the right upon exiting this entrance, you
   came to the entrance of a lower cave [Figure 12, part 12], which was
   dark and was at one time the hiding-place of the Blessed Virgin. In
   front of the main entrance, supported on posts, there was a light roof
   of reeds [Figure12, part 13], extending round the south of the cave to
   the entrance on that side, so that one could sit in front of the cave
   in shade. On the south side there were, high up, three openings for
   light and air, closed by gratings fixed in masonry. There was a similar
   opening in the roof of the cave. This roof, which was covered with
   turf, formed the extremity of the ridge on which Bethlehem stood.

   From the west one came through a light wickerwork door into a
   moderately broad passage opening into a chamber which was partly
   angular and partly semicircular. Towards the south it broadened out
   considerably, so that the ground-plan of the whole can be compared to a
   head resting on its neck. As you came out of the neck of the cave,
   whose roof was lower, into the higher part of the cave with its natural
   vaulting, you stepped down to a lower level. The floor of the whole
   cave was, however, higher at the sides, round which ran a low stone
   bench of varying breadth. The walls of the cave, as nature had made
   them, were, though not quite smooth, clean and pleasant and had
   something attractive about them. I liked them better than the rough,
   clumsy masonry which had been added on, for instance on the upper part
   of the south wall of the entrance, where three openings for light and
   air had been made. In the center of the roof of the cave there was
   another opening, and, if I remember rightly, I saw besides this three
   slanting holes piercing the upper part of the cave at intervals from
   south to east. From the north side of the passage an entrance led into
   a smaller side-cave [Figure 12, part 3]. Passing this entrance you came
   upon the place where Joseph lit his fire [Figure 12, part 4]. After
   that the wall turned northeast into the higher and bigger cave, and it
   was here that Joseph's pack-donkey stood [Figure 12, part 6], by the
   broad part of the stone bench which ran round its walls. Behind this,
   in the thickness of the rock wall to the north, was a small chamber
   [Figure 12, part 7] just big enough to hold the donkey and containing
   fodder. The wall of the cave then turned south-east, encircling the
   chamber (which grew broader towards the south) and finally turned north
   to end at the main entrance.

   The Blessed Virgin was in the eastern part of this cave [Figure 12,
   part 8], exactly opposite the entrance, when she gave birth to the
   Light of the World. The crib [Figure 12, part 10] in which the child
   Jesus was laid stood on the west side of the southern and more roomy
   part of the cave. This crib was a hollowed-out stone trough lying on
   the ground and used for cattle to drink from. Over it stood a longish,
   rectangular manger or rack, narrower below, and broader above, made of
   wooden lattice-work, and raised on four feet, so that the beasts could
   comfortably eat the hay or grass in the rack and lower their heads to
   drink the water in the trough beneath. When the three holy kings
   presented their gifts, the Blessed Virgin was sitting with the child
   Jesus opposite the crib on the eastern side of this part of the cave
   [Figure 12, part 9]. From the place where the crib is, if you go out of
   the cave in a westerly direction into the so-called neck of the cave,
   you come first of all, following the southern wall, to the southern
   entrance mentioned above and later opened by Joseph, and then arrive at
   St. Joseph's own room [Figure 12, part 2], which he later partitioned
   off on the south side by wicker screens in this passage. On this side
   there was a hollow in the wall where he put away all kinds of things.

   The road to the Shepherds' Valley ran past the south side of the cave.
   Here and there were little houses standing on hills, and scattered
   about in the fields were sheds thatched with reeds on four, six, or
   eight posts, with wicker walls. Towards the east of the cave the ground
   fell into a closed valley shut off on the north side and about a
   quarter of an hour's journey wide. Its slopes were covered with bushes,
   trees, and gardens. If one walked through the tall luxuriant grass in
   the meadow, watered by a spring, and through the trees planted in rows,
   one came to the eastern ridge of this valley. By following this very
   pleasant path in a south-easterly direction from the Cave of the
   Nativity, one came to a projecting spur of the ridge containing the
   rock-tomb of Maraha, [98] the nurse of Abraham, which was called the
   Milk Cave or the Sucklings' Cave. The Blessed Virgin came here several
   times with the child Jesus. Above this cave was a great tree with seats
   in it, and from here one had a much better view of Bethlehem than from
   the Cave of the Nativity.

   I was told much that had happened in the Cave of the Nativity of
   symbolical and prophetical significance in Old Testament times, but can
   only remember that Seth, the child of promise, was here conceived and
   born by Eve after a seven years' penance. She was told here by an angel
   that this seed was given by God in place of Abel. Seth was hidden and
   suckled by his mother in this cave and in Maraha's cave, for his
   brothers were hostile to him just as Jacob's sons were to Joseph. In
   these caves, inhabited by men in earlier times, I have often seen
   places hollowed out by them in the rock in which they and their
   children could sleep in comfort on skins or grass. So perhaps the
   hollow in the stone bench beneath the crib may have been a sleeping
   place of Seth's or of a later inmate. But I cannot say this for certain
   now.

   I also remember from my visions of the ministry of Jesus that the Lord,
   on October 6 ^th, after His Baptism, was keeping the Sabbath in the
   Cave of the Nativity, which had been made into a place of prayer by the
   shepherds, and that He told the shepherds that His Heavenly Father had
   appointed this as the place of His Birth as soon as Mary had conceived.

9. THE BURIAL CAVE OF MARAHA, ABRAHAM'S NURSE, ALSO CALLED THE CAVE OF THE
SUCKLINGS.

   Abraham had a nurse, Maraha, whom he greatly revered; she lived to a
   great age and he always took her on his journeys, riding on a camel.
   She lived with him for a long time in Succoth. Afterwards, towards the
   end of her life, she was here in the Shepherds' Valley, where he had
   his tents near to this cave. When she was more than a hundred years old
   and her death was at hand, she asked Abraham to bury her in this cave,
   prophesying about it and naming it the Cave of Milk or the Cave of the
   Sucklings. Some miracle, which I have forgotten, happened here, and a
   spring of water burst forth. The cave was then a high narrow passage of
   a white and not very hard substance. A mound of this blocked up part of
   the passage but did not reach to the roof. If one climbed over this
   mound, one came to the entrances of other caves higher up. There were
   also several deep passages running into the hill under the cave. Later
   it was enlarged. Abraham made Maraha's tomb out of the mound lying in
   the passage. Below was a massive block of stone on which rested a kind
   of heavy stone trough on short thick feet. The trough had a jagged top.
   One could see between the trough and the block under it. I was
   surprised to see nothing of it at the time of Jesus' Birth.

   This cave with the nurse's tomb was symbolically prophetic of the
   Mother of the Savior giving suck to her child while pursued by enemies;
   for in Abraham's youth a symbolically prophetic persecution took place,
   and his nurse saved his life by hiding him in a cave. As far as I can
   remember, the king in Abraham's country had a dream or was told by
   prophecy about a child to be born who would become a danger to him. The
   king took measures to prevent this. Abraham's mother concealed her
   pregnancy and gave birth to him in secret in a cave. Maraha, the nurse,
   suckled him in secret. She lived as though she were a poor slave, and
   worked in a wilderness near the cave in which she suckled the child
   Abraham. Afterwards his parents took him back, and on account of his
   being unusually big he was thought to have been born before that
   prophecy. However, when he was a boy, he was again in danger as the
   result of some supernatural utterances, and the nurse again saved him
   by hiding him away. I saw her carrying him off in secret, tied to her
   waist under her big cloak. Many children of his size were murdered at
   that time.

   This cave had been a place of devotion since Abraham's time,
   particularly for mothers and their babies. This was prophetic, for the
   reverence paid to Abraham's nurse was symbolic of that paid to the
   Blessed Virgin. In the same way Elijah had seen the Blessed Virgin in
   the rain-bearing cloud, and had made a place of prayer in her honor on
   Mount Carmel [see p. 28 ]. Maraha had contributed to the coming of the
   Messiah by nourishing with her milk the ancestor of the Blessed Virgin.
   I cannot, alas, explain it rightly, but it was like a deep spring of
   water running through the whole of life and always being replenished,
   until there burst forth from it the clear stream of Our Blessed Lady.
   [This was the expression used by Catherine Emmerich in her state of
   ecstatic sleep.]

   The tree which stood beside this cave was like a great lime-tree, with
   big shady branches. It was a terebinth, pointed at the top and broad
   below. It had white seeds, which were oily and could be eaten. Abraham
   met Melchizedek under this tree, but I cannot remember on what
   occasion. Joseph enlarged the cave still more and closed the passages
   leading downwards from it. The tree stands on a hill; beneath it is a
   door, set at a slant, leading into a passage or kind of vestibule where
   another door, set straight, opens into the tomb-cave itself. The latter
   is round rather than square. The shepherds often used the passage to
   shelter in. This big old tree cast a wide shadow. It was regarded as
   sacred by the shepherds and others in the neighborhood, and also by
   devout travelers. It was the custom to rest and pray there. I do not
   remember the history of the tree, but it had some connection with
   Abraham: he may perhaps have planted it. Near it was a fireplace which
   could be covered over, and there was also a spring in front of the
   tree, from which the shepherds used at certain times to draw water
   supposed to have a special healing property. On each side of the tree
   there were open huts to sleep in. It was all surrounded by a fence.

   [While Catherine Emmerich was recounting this, she was in great pain;
   and when the writer said to her, So this was a terebinth tree?' she
   answered in sudden absence of mind: Tenebrae, not Terebinth, under the
   shadow of Your Wings, that is a wing--Tenebrae--under Your Shadow will
   I rejoice.' The writer did not understand the significance of these
   words. Perhaps she was applying the words of the Psalm to the tree. She
   spoke with great intensity of feeling and seemed to be comforting
   herself with these words.]

   St. Helena built a church here and Mass has been said here: I think it
   seemed to be in a chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas.

10. THE HOLY FAMILY MOVES INTO THE CAVE OF THE NATIVITY.

   [November 23 ^rd:] The sun was already low when they reached the
   entrance of the cave. The young she-ass, which had left them at
   Joseph's ancestral house to run round the outside of the town, met them
   as soon as they arrived here and gamboled joyfully round them. Look,'
   said the Blessed Virgin to Joseph, it is certainly the will of God that
   we should go in here.' Joseph was, however, very distressed and
   secretly ashamed at having spoken so often of their good reception in
   Bethlehem. He put the pack-donkey under the shelter by the entrance of
   the cave and prepared a place for the Blessed Virgin to rest there
   while he kindled a light, opened the wickerwork door of the cave, and
   went into it. The passage into the cave was narrow, for it was full of
   bundles of straw like rushes, stacked against the walls with brown mats
   hanging over them. Behind, the cave itself was encumbered with a
   quantity of things. Joseph cleared out as much as was necessary to make
   a comfortable resting-place for the Blessed Virgin at the eastern end
   of the cave. Then he fastened a burning lamp in the wall of the dark
   cave and led the Blessed Virgin in. She sat down on the couch of rugs
   and bundles which he had prepared. He apologized most humbly for the
   poorness of the shelter, but Mary was joyful and contented in her
   inmost spirit. As she rested there, Joseph hurried with a skin which he
   had brought with him into the valley-meadow behind the hill, where
   there was a tiny brook. He fastened the skin with two pegs under the
   spring so that the water had to run into it, and then brought it back
   to the cave. Then he went to the town and fetched little bowls, some
   fruit, and bundles of twigs. The Sabbath was approaching, and because
   of the many strangers in the town, who were in urgent need of all kinds
   of things, tables had been set up at the street corners where
   indispensable necessities could be bought at reduced prices. Those who
   sold were menservants or people who were not Jews. I cannot quite
   remember about this. Joseph came back bringing burning coals in a sort
   of closed metal basket with a handle like a stalk under it. He emptied
   these out by the entrance to the cave on the northern side and made a
   little fire. He had the fire-basket and other small utensils with him
   on the journey. The bundle of wood was of thin sticks neatly tied
   together with broad rushes. Joseph then prepared a meal: it consisted
   of a kind of porridge made from yellow grains and a cooked fruit,
   thick, and when opened for eating, full of seeds. There were also
   little flat loaves of bread. After they had eaten and prayed, Joseph
   prepared a sleeping place for the Blessed Virgin. He first made a
   mattress of rushes, and then spread on it a coverlet of the kind I have
   described as having been prepared in Anna's house. At the head he put a
   rolled-up rug. After bringing in the pack-donkey and tying him up out
   of the way, he closed the openings in the roof to keep out the draught,
   and then prepared his own sleeping place in the entrance. As the
   Sabbath had now begun, he stood with the Blessed Virgin under the lamp,
   reciting the Sabbath prayers with her, after which they ate their
   little meal in a spirit of great piety. Joseph then left the cave and
   went into the town, while Mary wrapped herself up to lie down to rest.
   During Joseph's absence I saw for the first time the Blessed Virgin
   kneeling in prayer. She knelt on her couch, and then lay down on the
   coverlet on her side. Her head rested on her arm, which lay on the
   pillow. Joseph did not come back till late. He was distressed and I
   think he wept. He prayed and then lay down meekly on his couch at the
   entrance of the cave.

11. MARY CONCLUDES THE SABBATH IN THE BURIAL CAVE OF MARAHA.

   [Sunday, November 24 ^th: Catherine Emmerich was very ill today and
   could communicate only the little that follows:]

   The Blessed Virgin spent the Sabbath in the Cave of the Nativity in
   prayer and meditation and in great spiritual fervor. Joseph went out
   several times, probably to the synagogue in Bethlehem. I saw them
   sharing the food which had been prepared the day before, and praying
   together. In the afternoon of the Sabbath, when it is the Jewish custom
   to go for a walk, Joseph took the Blessed Virgin through the valley
   behind the cave to the tomb of Maraha, Abraham's nurse. They spent some
   time in this cave, which was roomier than the Cave of the Nativity, and
   in which Joseph had prepared a place for the Blessed Virgin to sit. The
   rest of the time they spent under the sacred tree near it, in prayer
   and meditation, until some time after the close of the Sabbath, when
   Joseph took her back again.

   Mary had told St. Joseph that tonight at midnight would be the hour of
   the child's birth, for then the nine months since the Annunciation
   would have been completed. She begged him to do all that was possible
   on his part so that they might show as much honor as they could to the
   child promised by God and supernaturally conceived. She asked him, too,
   to join with her in praying for the hard-hearted people who had refused
   to give them shelter. Joseph suggested to the Blessed Virgin that he
   should summon to her assistance some pious women whom he knew in
   Bethlehem. She declined, however, saying that she needed no human help.
   Just before the close of the Sabbath Joseph went into Bethlehem, and as
   soon as the sun had set, he quickly bought a few necessary things--a
   stool, a little low table, a few little bowls, and some dried fruit and
   grapes. With them he hurried back to the cave and then to the tomb of
   Maraha, and took the Blessed Virgin back to the Cave of the Nativity,
   where she lay down on her couch in the easternmost corner. Joseph
   prepared some more food, and they ate and prayed together. He then
   completely divided off his sleeping place from the rest of the cave by
   surrounding it with posts and hanging on them mats which he had found
   in the cave. He fed the donkey, which was standing to the left of the
   entrance against the wall of the cave; then he filled the manger above
   the crib with rushes and fine grass or moss, and spread a covering over
   it which hung down over the edge.

   On the Blessed Virgin telling him that her time was drawing near and
   that he was to retire into his room and pray, he hung up some more
   burning lamps in the cave and went out, as he had heard a noise
   outside. Here he found the young she-ass, who until now had been
   wandering about loose in the valley of the shepherds. She came joyfully
   running up and gamboled round him. He tied her up under the shelter
   before the cave and strewed fodder before her.

   When Joseph came back into the cave and stood at the entrance to his
   sleeping place looking towards the Blessed Virgin, he saw her with her
   face turned towards the east, kneeling on the bed facing away from him.
   He saw her as it were surrounded by flames, the whole cave was as if
   filled with supernatural light. He gazed at her like Moses when he saw
   the burning bush; then he went into his little cell in holy awe and
   threw himself on his face in prayer.

   [90] This chapter represents the journey of Mary and Joseph to
   Bethlehem for the enrolment: Luke 2.5-6. (SB)

   [91] AC several times explains that Joseph only lived a short time at
   Nazareth in the house provided by Anna, and did not at first intend to
   remain there. This intention throws light on Matt. 2.23, from which it
   would appear that he deliberately chose Nazareth as a dwelling-place on
   his return from Egypt, the alternative being the plan (explained by AC)
   of settling at Bethlehem, his birthplace. This plan he deliberately
   rejected, since Bethlehem was in Judea and he was afraid to go there' (
   Matt. 2.22) because of Archelaus. (SB)

   [92] The Field of Chimki is identified by AC (infra, p. 79 ) with
   Ginim; see next note. (SB)

   [93] The Field of Ginim, six hours from Nazareth, is presumably
   Engannim or Ginaea, the modern Jenin, eighteen miles south of Nazareth,
   near the corner of the Plain of Esdrelon. Engannim is mentioned in Jos.
   15.34 and 19.19 and is probably to be identified with Beth-haggan
   (Douay the garden house') of IV Kings 9.27. Cf. Cath. Comm., 275i. (SB)

   [94] This would refer to the foothills to the west of Mount Gilboa.

   that when she recounted these events on Nov. 22nd she could not give
   the exact situation of this tree, but could only say that it was
   somewhere near the path of the Holy Family. It is in any case not the
   cursed fig tree mentioned in the Gospels. (CB) The barren fig tree of
   Matt. 21.19 and Mark 11.13 stood between Bethany and Jerusalem. (SB)

   [97] The question of the successive registrations in the Roman Province
   of Syria is very intricate, together with the identification of the one
   in the year of Christ's birth; but there is evidence for censuses in
   Egypt and Gaul earlier in the reign of Augustus (cf. Cath. Comm.,
   749a). AC's reference (infra, p. 83 ) to the sharing of the revenue of
   the taxation remains entirely obscure. (SB)

                            XI. CHRIST'S BIRTH [99]

   I saw the radiance round the Blessed Virgin ever growing greater. The
   light of the lamps which Joseph had lit was no longer visible. The
   Blessed Virgin knelt on her rug in an ample ungirt robe spread out
   round her, her face turned towards the east.

   At midnight she was rapt in an ecstasy of prayer. I saw her lifted from
   the earth, so that I saw the ground beneath her. Her hands were crossed
   on her breast. The radiance about her increased; everything, even
   things without life, were in a joyful inner motion, the stones of the
   roof, of the walls, and of the floor of the cave became as it were
   alive in the light. Then I no longer saw the roof of the cave; a
   pathway of light opened above Mary, rising with ever-increasing glory
   towards the height of heaven.

   In this pathway of light there was a wonderful movement of glories
   interpenetrating each other, and, as they approached, appearing more
   clearly in the form of choirs of heavenly spirits. Meanwhile the
   Blessed Virgin, borne up in ecstasy, was now gazing downwards, adoring
   her God, whose Mother she had become and who lay on the earth before
   her in the form of a helpless newborn child. [100]

   I saw our Redeemer as a tiny child, shining with a light that
   overpowered all the surrounding radiance, and lying on the carpet at
   the Blessed Virgin's knees. It seemed to me as if He were at first
   quite small and then grew before my eyes. But the movement of the
   intense radiance was such that I cannot say for certain how I saw it.

   The Blessed Virgin remained for some time rapt in ecstasy. I saw her
   laying a cloth over the Child, but at first she did not touch Him or
   take Him up. After some time I saw the Child Jesus move and heard Him
   cry. Then Mary seemed to come to herself, and she took the Child up
   from the carpet, wrapping Him in the cloth which covered Him, and held
   Him in her arms to her breast. She sat there enveloping herself and the
   Child completely in her veil, and I think Mary suckled the Redeemer. I
   saw angels round her in human forms, lying on their faces and adoring
   the Child.

   It might have been an hour after His Birth when Mary called St. Joseph,
   who was still lying in prayer. When he came near, he threw himself down
   on his face in devout joy and humility. It was only when Mary begged
   him to take to his heart, in joy and thankfulness, the holy present of
   the Most High God, that he stood up, took the Child Jesus in his arms,
   and praised God with tears of joy.

   The Blessed Virgin then wrapped the Child Jesus in swaddling-bands. I
   cannot now remember how these bands were wound round; I only know that
   the Child was wrapped to His armpits first in red and then white bands,
   and that His head and shoulders were wrapped in another little cloth.
   Mary had only four sets of swaddling-bands with her. Then I saw Mary
   and Joseph sitting side by side on the bare earth with their feet under
   them. They did not speak, and seemed both to be sunk in meditation. On
   the carpet before Mary lay the newborn Jesus in swaddling clothes, a
   little Child, beautiful and radiant as lightning. Ah, I thought, this
   place enshrines the salvation of the whole world, and no one guesses
   it. Then they laid the Child in the manger, which was filled with
   rushes and delicate plants and covered with a cloth hanging over the
   sides. It stood above the stone trough lying on the ground, to the
   right of the entrance, where the cave makes a big curve towards the
   south. This part of the cave was at a lower level than the place where
   Our Lord was born: the floor slanted downwards in a step-like
   formation. After laying the Child in the crib, they both stood beside
   Him giving praise to God with tears of joy. Joseph then arranged the
   Blessed Virgin's resting-place and her seat beside the Crib. [See
   Figure 13.] Both before and after the Birth of Jesus, I saw her dressed
   in white and veiled. I saw her there in the first days after the
   Nativity, sitting, kneeling, standing, and sleeping on her side,
   wrapped up but in no way ill or exhausted. When people came to see her,
   she wrapped herself up more closely and sat upright on her lying-in
   coverlet.

   Figure 13. Mary's resting place beside the crib.

1. GREAT JOY IN NATURE. "GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST".

   In these pictures of Christ's Birth, which I see as an historical event
   and not as a Feast of the Church, I do not see such radiant and
   ecstatic joy in nature as I do on Christmas night when the vision that
   I see expresses an interior significance. Yet I saw in this vision an
   unwonted joy and an extraordinary movement at midnight in many places
   even to the uttermost parts of the earth. I saw the hearts of many good
   men filled with joyful yearning, while all the wicked were overcome by
   great fear. I saw many animals filled with joy; in some places I saw
   flowers, herbs, and shrubs shooting up, and trees drinking in
   refreshment and scattering sweet scents. I saw many springs of water
   gush forth and increase. In the night of the Savior's Birth, an
   abundant spring welled up in the cave in the hill to the north of the
   Cave of the Nativity. Next day St. Joseph captured it and made an
   outlet for it. The sky was dull over Bethlehem and had a dull reddish
   glow; but over the Cave of the Nativity and over the valley by Martha's
   tomb and the Shepherd's Valley lay a shining mist of dew. In the
   Shepherd's Valley there was a hill about an hour and a half's journey
   from the Cave of the Nativity, where the vineyards begin which stretch
   from there towards Gaza. On this hill were the huts of three shepherds
   who were the rulers of the shepherds' families in this region just as
   the three holy kings were rulers of the tribes belonging to them. About
   twice as far away from the Cave of the Nativity as this hill was the
   so-called Shepherds' Tower. [Please refer to Figure 14]. This was a
   very high pyramid-shaped erection of wooden beams, built among green
   trees on a base of big stones on a hill in the midst of the fields. It
   was surrounded by stairs and galleries, and in places there were little
   covered stands like watchtowers. It was all hung with mats. It
   resembled those tower-like edifices which were used in the land of the
   three holy kings to observe the stars at night; from the distance it
   looked like a tall many-masted ship under sail. One had from it a very
   wide view of the whole region; one saw Jerusalem, and also the Mount of
   Temptation in the desert of Jericho. The shepherds stationed men up
   there to watch the flocks as they moved about and to give warning of
   danger by blowing horns if they saw in the distance robbers or armed
   bands. The families of the various shepherds lived round the tower
   within a circle of some five hours in circumference; their farms were
   separate and surrounded by fields and gardens. The tower was their
   general meeting-place, as it was also for the watchers, who kept their
   belongings here and got their food from here. There were huts built on
   the slopes of the hill on which the tower stood, and separate from
   these there was a large shed, divided into many partitions, where the
   wives of the watchers lived and prepared food for them. Here by the
   tower I saw tonight some of the flocks and herds out in the open, but
   by the hill of the three shepherds I saw them in a shed. When Jesus was
   born, I saw the three shepherds standing together before their hut,
   marveling at the wonderful night. They looked about them, and were
   astonished to see a wonderful radiance over the place where the Cave of
   the Nativity was. I also saw the shepherds at the more distant tower in
   great commotion. I saw some of them climbing the tower and gazing at
   the strange radiance over the cave. As the three shepherds thus gazed
   up into the sky, I saw a cloud of light sinking down towards them. As
   it drew near, I perceived a movement in it, a changing and
   transformation into figures and forms, and I heard a song which
   gradually grew louder. It was sweet and gentle and yet clear and
   joyful. The shepherds were at first afraid, but forthwith an angel
   stood before them and spoke to them: Fear not,' he said, for behold, I
   bring you good tidings of great joy that shall be to all the people;
   for this day is born to you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, in the
   city of David. And this shall be a sign to you. You shall find the
   infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger.' While the
   angel was announcing this, the radiance round him increased, and I now
   saw five or seven beautiful great shining forms of angels standing
   before the shepherds. They were holding in their hands a long scroll on
   which was written something in letters as big as one's hand, and I
   heard them praising God and singing Glory be to God in the highest: and
   on earth peace to men of goodwill'. The shepherds at the tower saw the
   same vision, but somewhat later. The angels also appeared to a third
   party of shepherds near a spring three hours from Bethlehem and to the
   east of the shepherd's tower. I did not see the shepherds hasten at
   once to the Cave of the Nativity, which was about an hour and a half
   distant from the three shepherds and twice as far from the tower. But,
   I saw them at once consulting together as to what they should bring as
   a present to the newborn Child and getting their gifts together with
   all speed. They did not arrive at the Crib until early in the morning.

2. OCCURRENCES DURING THE BIRTH OF CHRIST IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.

   At the time that the Child Jesus was born my soul made countless
   journeys to all parts of the world, to see the wonderful happenings at
   the birth of Our Savior. As, however, I was very ill and tired, it
   often seemed to me as if the pictures came to me instead of I to them.
   I have seen countless events, but have forgotten most of them because
   of much suffering and many disturbances; all that I can remember are
   the following fragments.

3. REVELATIONS OF THE BIRTH TO THE KINSWOMEN AND FRIENDS OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

   I saw last night that Noemi, the teacher of the Blessed Virgin, and the
   prophetess Anna, and the aged Simeon in the Temple, and the Blessed
   Virgin's mother, Anna, in Nazareth, and Elizabeth in Juttah, all had
   visions and revelations about the birth of the Savior. I saw the child
   John, in Elizabeth's house, moved by wonderful joy. Though they all saw
   and recognized Mary in these visions, they did not know where the
   miracle had taken place, not even Elizabeth. Anna alone knew that
   Bethlehem was the place of salvation.

4. OCCURRENCES DURING THE BIRTH OF CHRIST IN JERUSALEM.

   Last night I saw a wonderful happening in the Temple. All the written
   scrolls of the Sadducees were several times hurled out of their shelves
   and strewn about the floor. This caused great alarm; they ascribed it
   to sorcery and paid much money to keep it secret.

   [She here recounted some obscure story about two sons of Herod's who
   were Sadducees and had been placed in the Temple by him [101] ; and how
   he was always engaged in some dispute or other with the Pharisees and
   was always trying by underhand means to obtain more power in the
   Temple.]

5. OCCURRENCES DURING THE BIRTH OF CHRIST IN ROME.

   I saw much in Rome last night, but of all the pictures I saw I have
   forgotten many and may easily have confused some of them. I will tell
   them as I remember them.

   When Jesus was born, I saw that in Rome, on the other side of the
   river, where many Jews lived [she here described not very clearly a
   place like a hill surrounded by water, forming a kind of peninsula], a
   spring as of oil burst forth and caused general astonishment. A
   magnificent idol of Jupiter also broke in pieces in a temple of which
   the whole roof fell in. They made sacrifices in great alarm, and asked
   another idol--of Venus, I think--what this signified, and received the
   answer (which must have been spoken by the devil out of the mouth of
   the idol): This befell because a virgin without a husband conceived a
   son and has now given birth to him.' This idol spoke also of the
   fountain of oil that had sprung forth. Where it sprang forth, there now
   stands a church dedicated to the Mother of God. [102]

   I saw the heathen priests consulting their records in great alarm.
   Seventy years before, when that idol was being magnificently adorned
   with gold and precious stones, and was being honored with solemn
   sacrifices, there lived in Rome a very good and pious woman (I am not
   sure whether she was a Jewess or not) whose name sounded like Serena or
   Cyrena. She had enough money to live on, saw visions, and was impelled
   to prophesy. I have forgotten a great deal about her, but I think she
   used often to tell people the cause of their unfruitfulness. This woman
   had openly proclaimed that such costly honors should not be paid to the
   idol, for one day it would burst asunder. The priests called her to
   account because of this declaration, and demanded that she should say
   when this would happen; and as she could not at once reply, she was
   imprisoned and tortured until she obtained by her prayers to God the
   reply that the idol would break in pieces when a pure virgin should
   bear a son. This announcement was received with derision, and she was
   released as being out of her senses. Now, when the collapse of the
   temple did indeed shatter the idol, they recognized that she had
   prophesied truly, and were astonished at her having fixed a time for
   this event. They knew of course nothing of Christ having been born of
   the Blessed Virgin.

   I saw that both the Roman consuls called for reports about this event
   and about the appearance of the fountain of oil. One of the consuls was
   called Lentulus and was an ancestor of the martyred priest Moses and of
   the Lentulus who was a friend of St. Peter in Rome.

   I also saw something connected with the Emperor Augustus, but can no
   longer remember it distinctly. I saw the Emperor with some other men on
   a hill in Rome, on the other side of which was the temple that had
   fallen in. There were steps leading up the hill, which had a golden
   gate on it. Business matters were settled there. When the Emperor
   descended the hill, he saw on the right-hand side, over the top of the
   hill, an apparition in the sky. [Please refer to Figure 15.] It was a
   vision of a virgin above a rainbow, and a child was soaring up from
   her. I think that only he saw it. He asked for an explanation of this
   apparition from an oracle that had long been dumb, and it gave an
   answer about a newborn child before whom all must give way. Thereupon
   he caused an altar to be set up on the hill over which he had seen the
   appearance, and dedicated it with many sacrifices to the Firstborn of
   God. I have forgotten much of all this.

6. OCCURRENCES DURING THE BIRTH OF CHRIST IN EGYPT.

   I saw also in Egypt an event which proclaimed the birth of Christ. Far
   away in the country beyond Matarea, Heliopolis, and Memphis a great
   idol, which until then had uttered oracles of many kinds, fell suddenly
   silent. The king then ordered that great sacrifices should be offered
   throughout the country in order that the idol might explain its
   silence. The idol was thereupon obliged by God to say that it was
   silent and must give way because a virgin had given birth to a son, to
   whom a temple would here be erected. On hearing this, the king of that
   country decided to build a temple in his honor near the temple of the
   idol. I cannot clearly remember what happened, but I know that the idol
   was taken away and a temple was built here in honor of the virgin with
   the Child whom it had proclaimed, and that she was there honored after
   their heathen fashion.

7. VISIONS APPEAR DURING THE BIRTH OF CHRIST TO THE THREE HOLY KINGS.

   At the hour when the Child Jesus was born I saw a wonderful vision
   which appeared to the three holy kings. These kings were
   star-worshippers and had a tower shaped like a pyramid with steps. It
   was made partly of timber and was on the top of a hill; one of them was
   always there, with several priests, to observe the stars. They always
   wrote down what they saw and communicated it to each other. On this
   night I think I saw two of the kings on this tower. The third, who
   lived to the east of the Caspian Sea, was not with them. They always
   observed one particular star, in which they saw various changes; they
   also saw visions in the sky. Last night I saw the picture which
   appeared to them; there were several variations of it. They did not see
   it in one star, but in a figure composed of several stars, and these
   stars were in motion. They saw a beautiful rainbow over the moon, which
   was in one of its quarters. Upon the rainbow a Virgin was enthroned;
   her right foot was resting on the moon. To the left of the Virgin, on
   the rainbow, was a vine, and on the right a sheaf of wheat. In front of
   the Virgin I saw the form of a chalice, shaped like the one used by Our
   Lord at the institution of the Blessed Sacrament. It seemed to rise up
   or to issue more clearly out of the radiance surrounding it. I saw a
   little child coming forth out of this chalice, and above the child a
   transparent disc, like an empty monstrance, from which rays like ears
   of wheat proceeded. It made me think of the Blessed Sacrament. On the
   right-hand side of the child issuing from the chalice, a branch grew
   forth on which an octagonal church blossomed like a flower. It had a
   great golden gate and two small side-doors. The Virgin moved the
   chalice, the child, and the host with her right hand, guiding them into
   the church before her. I saw into it, and as I did so it seemed to
   become quite big. I saw an appearance of the Holy Trinity in the back
   of the church. The tower of the church rose above this appearance,
   which at last turned into a city radiant with light, like the heavenly
   Jerusalem. In this picture I saw many things developing out of each
   other as I looked into this church; but I can no longer remember in
   what order I saw them, nor can I recollect in what manner the kings
   were informed that the child had been born in Judea. The third king who
   lived farther away saw the same picture in his own home in the same
   hour. The kings were filled with inexpressible joy at this vision, and
   immediately gathered together their treasures and presents and began
   their journey. It was only after several days that all three met.
   Already in the days just before the birth of Christ I noticed that they
   were in a state of great activity on their observatory tower and saw
   visions of many kinds.

   Figure 15. Vision of the Emperor Augustus on the day of Jesus' birth.

   How great was God's compassion towards the heathen! Shall I tell you
   from whence this prophecy came to the kings? I will recount now only
   just the end of it, for at this moment I cannot remember the whole. The
   ancestors of the three kings, from whom they descended in an unbroken
   line from father to son, lived as long ago as five hundred years before
   Christ's birth. (Elijah [103] must have lived eight hundred years
   before Christ.) Their ancestors were richer and more powerful than the
   three kings, for their possessions and inheritances had not been so
   much divided up as later on. Even in those times they lived in cities
   of tents--except the ancestor to the east of the Caspian Sea, whose
   city I now see; its foundations are of stone and the tents are set up
   on these, for it lies beside the sea, which often overflows. (Here on
   the mountains one is so high up; I see a sea to my right and one to my
   left; it is like looking into a black hole.) These chieftains were
   already at that time star-worshippers; but besides that they practiced
   dreadfully evil ceremonies; they sacrificed old men and cripples and
   slaughtered children as well. The most cruel of all their practices was
   to put the children, dressed in white, into cauldrons, and to boil them
   alive. But at last all this was changed for the better, and in spite of
   it God allowed these blind heathens to know of the birth of the
   Redeemer so long beforehand. In those days three daughters of these
   early chieftains were living at the same time. They were learned in the
   science of the stars, and all received at the same time the spirit of
   prophecy.

   They all three saw at the same time in a vision that a star should rise
   out of Jacob and that a virgin should give birth to the Savior without
   knowing man. They wore long cloaks, and went about the whole country
   preaching amendment of life and announcing that the messengers of the
   Redeemer would one day come to them and bring them the ceremonies of
   the true religion. They also prophesied many things about our own and
   even later times. The fathers of these three virgins then built a
   temple in honor of the future Mother of God to the south of the sea,
   where their three countries met, and made sacrifices to her--some of
   them in that cruel manner of which I have spoken. The prophecies of the
   three virgins included something definite about a picture in the stars
   and various transformations in it: whereupon they began to look for
   this picture from a hill near the temple to the future Mother of God.
   They took note of everything and according to what they observed they
   kept on making various alterations on and in their temples, in their
   ceremonies and in their decorations. They varied the color of the
   tent-roof of the temple, which was sometimes blue, sometimes red, and
   sometimes yellow or still another color. They transferred (and this
   seemed to me remarkable) their weekly feast day to the Sabbath. Before
   it used to be Thursday, and I still remember its name. [Here she
   stammered something which sounded like Tanna or Tanada, but was not
   clearly audible.] [104]

8. VISION FRAGMENTS WHICH DETERMINE THE EXACT DATE OF THE BIRTH OF CHRIST.

   [In the course of her visions of Christmas night Catherine Emmerich saw
   much that indicated the exact date of Christ's birth, but she forgot a
   great deal of it owing to illness and the disturbance of receiving
   visitors on the following day, which was her name-day, the feast of St.
   Catherine. That evening, however, shortly after these visits, she
   repeatedly gave utterance, in a state of trance, to the following
   fragments of these visions. It should be noted that she sees all dates
   written in Roman figures, i.e. with letters; and finds some difficulty
   in reading them; though she nearly always makes herself clear by
   repeating them several times in the order in which they appear or by
   showing them on her fingers. Today she did both. This is what she
   said:]

   Now, you can read this: look, there it is: Christ was born when the
   year of the world 3997 was not yet quite completed. Afterwards people
   forgot the period of three years and a portion of a year which
   intervened between His birth and the year 4000, and then reckoned our
   new era as beginning four years later, so that Christ was born seven
   years and a portion of a year earlier than according to our reckoning.
   [105] One of the consuls in Rome at that time was called Lentulus; he
   was an ancestor of the priest and martyr Moses, of whom I possess a
   relic here, and who lived at the time of St. Cyprian. The Lentulus who
   was a friend of St. Peter in Rome also descended from him. Christ was
   born in the forty-fifth year of the Emperor Augustus. Herod reigned
   forty years in all until his death. [106] He was, it is true, only a
   vassal-king for seven years, but harassed the country grievously, and
   committed many cruelties. He died about the time of Christ's sixth
   year. I think that his death was kept a secret for some time. His end
   was dreadful, and in the last days of his life he was responsible for
   many murders and much misery. I saw him crawling about in a room padded
   with cushions. He had a spear, and stabbed at anyone who came near him.
   Jesus must have been born about the thirty-fourth year of Herod's
   reign. Two years before the entry of Mary into the Temple, just
   seventeen years before the Birth of Christ, Herod ordered that work
   should be done in the Temple. [107] It was not a rebuilding of the
   Temple, but alterations and embellishments were made here and there.
   The Flight into Egypt took place when Christ was nine months old, and
   the Massacre of the Innocents was in His second year.

   [She mentioned, in addition, many other things--incidents, features,
   and journeys--from Herod's life, which showed how clearly she saw
   everything, but it was impossible to collect and arrange these very
   numerous communications, some of which she recounted only in
   fragments.]

   The Birth of Christ occurred in a year which the Jews reckoned as
   having thirteen months. This must have been some such arrangement as
   our leap-years. [108] I think I have forgotten something about the Jews
   having months of twenty-one and twenty-two days twice a year. I heard
   something about feast-days connected with this, but have only a dim
   recollection of it all. I also saw how at different times something was
   altered in their calendar. It was after their coming out of a
   captivity, and the Temple was being added to at the same time. I saw
   the man who altered the calendar and I knew his name. [Here she tried
   to remember and said in her how German dialect with a smiling pretence
   of impatience, I can't remember the fellow's name'.] I think Christ was
   born in the month Kislev. [109] The reason why the Church keeps the
   feast exactly a month later than the actual event is because at one
   time, when an alteration in the calendar was made, some days and
   seasons were completely omitted. [110] I once saw it very plainly, but
   can no longer recall it properly.

9. THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS.

   [Sunday, November 25 ^th (morning):] In the early dawn after Christ's
   Birth the three chief shepherds came from their hill to the Cave of the
   Nativity with their presents, which they had gathered together
   beforehand. These presents were little animals not unlike roe-deer. If
   they were kids, those in that country look very different from ours
   here at home. They had long necks, very clear beautiful eyes, and were
   very swift and graceful. The shepherds led them behind and beside them
   on long, thin cords. The shepherds also had strings of dead birds
   hanging over their shoulders, and carried some bigger live birds under
   their arms. When they knocked shyly at the door of the cave, St. Joseph
   came towards them with a friendly greeting. They told him what the
   angel had announced to them that night, and how they were come to
   worship the Child of the Promise and to present their poor gifts to
   him. Joseph took their gifts with humble gratitude, and made them take
   the animals into the little chamber the entrance of which is by the
   southern door of the cave. Then he accompanied them into the cave
   itself, and led the three shepherds up to the Blessed Virgin, who was
   sitting on the coverlet on the ground by the Crib, holding the Child
   Jesus before her on her lap. The shepherds, holding their staffs in
   their hands, threw themselves humbly on their knees before Jesus,
   weeping for joy. They remained a long time speechless with bliss and
   then sang the angels' hymn of praise which they had heard in the night,
   and a psalm which I have forgotten. When they got up to go away, the
   Blessed Virgin put the little Jesus into their arms one after the
   other. They gave Him back to her with tears and left the cave.

   [Sunday, November 25 ^th (evening): During the whole day Catherine
   Emmerich was in great distress of body and mind. She had hardly fallen
   asleep in the evening when she at once felt herself transported to the
   Promised Land. During this year she had been also contemplating the
   first year of Christ's ministry, and particularly His forty-days' fast,
   and she exclaimed in childlike wonder: What a moving sight! On one side
   I see Jesus as a man thirty years of age fasting and tempted in a cave
   in the wilderness, and on the other I see Him as a newborn child in the
   Cave of the Nativity, adored by the shepherds from the shepherds'
   tower.' After these words the visionary rose from her couch with
   astonishing rapidity, ran to the open door of her room and called in an
   ecstasy of joy to some friends who were in the outer room: Come
   quickly, quickly to adore the Child, He is in my room.' She returned as
   rapidly to her couch, and began, quivering with rapture and devotion,
   to sing in a clear, inexpressibly moving voice the Magnificat, Gloria
   in Excelsis, and some other unknown hymns of praise. These were simple
   but profound and were partly in rhyme. In one hymn she sang second. She
   was in an unusually joyful and excited mood and said next morning:]

   Yesterday evening several shepherds and shepherdesses and children from
   the Shepherds' Tower, which is four hours away, came to the Crib with
   presents. They brought eggs, birds, honey, woven stuffs of different
   colors, little bunches of what looked like raw silk, and bushes of a
   rush-like shrub with big leaves and ears full of thick grains. After
   handing their presents to St. Joseph, they came up humbly to the Crib,
   beside which the Blessed Virgin sat. They greeted her and the Child,
   and then, kneeling round her, they sang some lovely hymns, the Gloria
   in Excelsis, and a few short verses. I sang with them; they sang in
   parts. In one of the hymns I sang second. I remember the words more or
   less: O little child, red as a rose, like a herald you come forth.'
   When they made their farewell, they bent over the Crib as though they
   were kissing the Infant Jesus.

10. THE SHEPHERDS ASSIST ST. JOSEPH. ESSENE WOMEN RENDER SERVICE TO THE BLESSED
VIRGIN.

   [November 26 ^th:] Today I saw the three shepherds taking it in turns
   to help St. Joseph to arrange things more comfortably in the cave,
   round about it and in the side caves. I also saw several devout women
   with the Blessed Virgin, assisting her in various ways. These women
   were Essenes, and lived not far from the cave, as you went round to the
   east of the hill. They lived near each other in the deep part of the
   valley, in little chambers high up in the rock at a place where the
   hill had broken away. They had small gardens beside their dwellings and
   gave lessons to children belonging to their sect. St. Joseph had asked
   them to come; he knew this community since his childhood, for when as a
   boy he bid himself from his brothers in the Cave of the Nativity, he
   sometimes visited these pious women in their rock-dwellings. They took
   it in turns to come to the Blessed Virgin, bringing her bundles of wood
   and other small necessities, and cooking and washing for the Holy
   Family.

11. THE DONKEY KNEELS BEFORE JESUS. ST. ANNE'S MAID FROM NAZARETH COMES TO MARY.

   [November 27 ^th:] Today I saw a very touching scene in the cave.
   Joseph and Mary were standing by the Crib, looking at the Infant Jesus
   with great devotion, when the donkey threw himself suddenly on his
   knees and bent his head down to the ground. Mary and Joseph wept. In
   the evening came messengers from Anna, the Blessed Virgin's holy
   mother. An elderly man and Anna's maidservant, a widow who was related
   to her, arrived from Nazareth. [Please see Figure 16.] They brought all
   kinds of little things which Mary needed. They were greatly moved at
   seeing the Infant, and the old manservant wept tears of joy. He soon
   started home again to bring Anna news. The maidservant remained with
   the Blessed Virgin.

   Figure 16. Saint Anne's maid.

12. THE BLESSED VIRGIN HIDES FROM EMISSARIES OF HEROD.

   [November 28 ^th:] Today I saw the Blessed Virgin with the Infant Jesus
   and the maidservant leaving the cave for several hours. I saw that
   after coming out of the door she turned to the right under the
   projecting thatched roof, then took a few steps and hid herself in the
   side cave. This was the cave where the fountain of water sprang up at
   Christ's birth and was captured by Joseph. She remained four hours in
   this cave, but later she spent a few days there. Joseph had been there
   at dawn to make a few arrangements for her comfort. They were given an
   inner warning to go there, for today there came to the cave from
   Bethlehem some men, emissaries of Herod, I think, because of the rumor,
   spread abroad by the shepherds' talk, that some wonderful thing had
   happened there connected with a child. I saw these men exchanging a few
   remarks with St. Joseph, whom they met in front of the Cave of the
   Nativity in the company of the shepherds. When they saw how poor and
   simple he was, they left him with supercilious smiles. The Blessed
   Virgin remained with the Infant Jesus about four hours in the
   side-cave, and then returned to the Crib. The Cave of the Nativity is
   pleasantly situated and very quiet. No one comes here from Bethlehem,
   except the shepherds whose duties bring them here. In general no one in
   Bethlehem pays any attention to what happens out here, for owing to the
   many strangers there is a great press of people coming and going in the
   town. There is much buying and slaughtering of beasts, as many of the
   people present pay their taxes with beasts. There are also many heathen
   there, who work as servants.

   [This evening Catherine Emmerich said suddenly in her sleep: Herod has
   had a pious man murdered who had an important post in the Temple. He
   invited him most warmly to visit him at Jericho and had him murdered on
   the way. He was opposed to Herod's pretensions regarding the Temple. In
   spite of Herod being accused of this murder, his power over the Temple
   increases.' She again insisted that Herod had appointed two of his
   natural sons to high places in the Temple; that these were Sadducees
   and that they betrayed to him everything that went on there.]

13. THE ANGEL'S APPEARANCE TO THE SHEPHERDS HAS BECOME WIDESPREAD.

   [November 29 ^th:] Early this morning the friendly innkeeper from the
   last inn, in which the Holy Family spent the night from November 22
   ^nd-23 ^rd, sent a servant with presents to the cave, and in the course
   of the day he came himself to worship the Child. The appearance of the
   angels to the shepherds in the hour of Christ's Birth has made the
   story of the wonderful Child of the Promise known to all good folk here
   in the valleys, and these people have come to worship the Child whom
   they had sheltered unknown to themselves.

14. MANY PEOPLE VISIT THE CHILD JESUS ON THE WAY TO BETHLEHEM. JOSEPH PAWNS THE
SHE-ASS.

   [November 30 ^th:] Today several shepherds and other good people came
   to the Cave of the Nativity and worshipped the Infant Jesus with great
   fervor. They were dressed in their best and were on their way to
   Bethlehem for the Sabbath. Among these people I saw the surly
   shepherd's good wife, who had given shelter to the Holy Family on
   November 20 ^th. She might have taken a more direct road from her home
   to go to Jerusalem for the Sabbath, but she made a detour by Bethlehem
   in order to pay respect to the Holy Child and His dear parents. The
   good woman was full of happiness at having shown them loving-kindness.
   Today, I also saw St. Joseph's relations, near whose dwelling the Holy
   Family had passed the night of November 22 ^nd, come to the cave and
   greet the Child. Among them was the father of that Jonadab who at the
   Crucifixion brought Jesus a cloth to cover His nakedness. He had heard
   from the innkeeper of his village about Joseph's journey through the
   place and about the wonderful happenings at the birth of the Child, and
   had come here with presents for Him on his way to the Sabbath at
   Bethlehem. He greeted Mary and worshipped the Infant Jesus. Joseph was
   very friendly with him; he accepted nothing from him, but gave him the
   young she-ass (who had been running free with them) as a pledge, on
   condition that he could redeem her on repayment of the money. Joseph
   needed the money to pay for the presents and the meal at the
   circumcision ceremony. After Joseph had finished this business and
   everybody had gone to the synagogue in Bethlehem, he hung up in the
   cave the Sabbath lamp with seven wicks, lit it, and put beneath it a
   table covered with a red-and-white cloth on which lay prayer-scrolls.
   Here under the lamp he celebrated the eve of the Sabbath, reciting
   prayers with the Blessed Virgin and Anna's maidservant. [111] Two
   shepherds stood farther back in the entrance of the cave. The Essene
   women were also present, and afterwards they prepared the meal. Today,
   the eve of the Sabbath, the Essene women and the maidservant prepared
   several dishes for the next day. I saw the plucked and cleaned birds
   being roasted on a spit over the glowing embers. While roasting them
   they rolled them in a kind of flour made by pounding grains which grew
   in the ears of a rush-like plant. This plant grows wild only in damp,
   marshy places in that country and on the sunny side. In some places it
   is cultivated. It grows wild near Bethlehem and Hebron, but I never saw
   it near Nazareth. The shepherds of the tower had brought some of it to
   Joseph. I saw them making the grains into a thick shiny white paste,
   and they also baked cakes with the flour. I saw open holes under the
   fireplace, very hot, where they baked cakes as well as birds and other
   things. They kept for themselves very little of the many provisions
   given by the shepherds to St. Joseph. Most of it went as presents and
   as food for others, especially for the poor. Tomorrow evening, during
   the meal at the circumcision ceremony, there will be a great
   distribution.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [99] Matt. 2 .1 ; Birth, Adoration of the Shepherds, Circumcision: Luke
   2.7-21. (SB)

   [100] AC's delicate description of the painless, miraculous birth of
   Christ finds parallels (especially in the cave being filled with light)
   in Protev. 19 and Ps-Matt. 13, though both these apocryphal sources
   introduce a midwife, whose services are not required. (SB)

   [101] Herod's two sons, placed in the Temple, are mentioned by AC
   (infra, p. 102 ) as natural sons. History is, however, silent in their
   regard. (SB)

   [102] The tradition about strange portents in Rome at the birth of
   Christ is very ancient. Its first appearance in a document seems to be
   in the Universal History of Orosius (A.D. 418), the friend of St.
   Augustine. We find here the fountain of oil, the idol speaking, the
   vision of Augustus, and so forth. The story was elaborated by the time
   of the fourteenth-century Byzantine historian Nicephorus Callistus. The
   matter is fully studied in Graf, Roma nella memoria e nelle
   immaginazioni del medio evo, Turin, 1882, Vol. 1, pp. 308-331, where
   the texts are reproduced. The Church of Our Lady in question is Santa
   Maria in Ara Coeli, on the Capitol Hill, where Augustus is said to have
   put up a new altar (infra, p. 94 ). The mention (infra, p. 94 ) of the
   consul Lentulus need not be associated with the fictitious letter of
   Lentulus (a supposed Roman official in Judea) about the appearance of
   Christ. But there was a consul Lucius Lentulus after the death of
   Julius Caesar (44 B.C.), mentioned by Josephus (Ant., XIV, x, 13).
   Lentulus the friend of Peter in Rome is unknown, and is not likely to
   be Lentulus Getulicus who was involved in a plot against Caligula in
   A.D. 41 and was executed, since Peter probably did not come to Rome
   until A.D. 42. The priest Moses was one of the first martyrs under
   Decius, and died in 251 (Ramsgate Book of Saints). (SB)

   [103] Elijah makes his appearance in 3 Kings 17.1 in the reign of King
   Ahab, 874-853 B.C. (SB)

   [104] Here her story was interrupted by so strange and sudden an
   occurrence that we feel bound to communicate it, so characteristic is
   it of her condition. It was about six o'clock in the evening of Nov.
   27th, 1821, when she spoke these last words in her sleep. It must be
   remembered that for many years her feet had been paralyzed; she could
   not walk, and could with difficulty raise herself to a sitting
   position, so that she was, as always, lying stretched out on her couch.
   The door stood open between her room and the room adjoining it in which
   her confessor was at that moment sitting by the lamp reading his
   Breviary. She had just said these words with such truth of expression
   that it was impossible to doubt that she was seeing it all actually
   happening before her eyes. Hardly, however, had she stammered out the
   word Tanada' than the enfeebled and paralyzed sleeper suddenly sprang
   up from her couch with lightning speed, hurried into the adjoining
   room, and rushed to the window, striking out with hands and feet as if
   she were attacking and warding off something. Then, turning to her
   confessor, she said, That was a great big brute, but I gave him a kick
   and sent him off'. After these words she sank down as if fainting, and
   lay very quietly and calmly on the floor of the room before the window.
   The priest at his Breviary was, like the writer, staggered by this
   highly surprising incident, but without wasting words he said to her,
   Sister Emmerich, under obedience, go back to your bed'; whereupon she
   at once got up, returned to her room, and lay down again on her bed.
   When the writer asked her, What was that strange incident?' she told
   him the following. She was wide awake and in full consciousness, and
   though she was tired, she was in the cheerful state of mind of someone
   who has won a victory. Yes, it was indeed odd. I was so far, far away
   in the land of the three kings. I was standing on the high mountain
   ridge between the two seas, looking down into their tent-cities (just
   as one looks out of the window here into the poultry-yard), when I
   suddenly felt myself called home by my guardian angel. I turned round
   and saw here in Dülmen, passing in front of our little house, a poor
   old woman whom I knew. She had come out of a little grocer's shop. She
   was in a very bad and evil-tempered mood, and was grumbling and cursing
   to herself in a quite abominable way. Then I saw that her guardian
   angel abandoned her and that a great black devil-shape laid itself
   across her path in the dark, to make her stumble over him and break her
   neck and so die in her sins. When I saw that, I let the three kings be
   ( liess ich drei Könige drei Könige sein' ), prayed earnestly to God to
   help the poor woman, and was back here in my room. Then I saw that the
   devil was beating against the window in dreadful fury and was trying to
   break into the room; I saw that he had a whole bundle of nooses and
   knotted strings in his claws. He was trying, out of revenge, to start a
   great complication and annoyance here with all these; so I rushed at
   him and gave him a kick which made him stagger back. That will have
   given him something to remember! And then I lay down before the window
   across his path, to prevent him from coming in.' It is indeed strange
   that while she is looking down from the Caucasus and seeing and
   recounting things that happened five hundred years before Christ's
   birth as though they were before her eyes, she should at the same
   moment see the danger surrounding a poor little old woman close to her
   house at home and should hurry energetically to help her. It was an
   amazing spectacle to see her rushing in like a living skeleton and
   fighting with such violence, whereas in her waking state, she can,
   since Sept. 8th, hardly move forward a few steps on her crutches
   without fainting. (CB)

   [105] The date of Christ's birth is usually fixed by modern scholars in
   8 B.C. (e.g. Fr. T. Corbishley, S.J., in Cath. Comm., 676a), or at
   latest 6-4 B.C. (ib., 749a), but the argument is from contemporary
   history (such as the death of Herod in 4 B.C.), and not, as AC
   suggests, from the computation of the Annus Mundi. Yet it is
   interesting that AC's date 7 B.C. is so near the conclusions of
   present-day studies. (SB)

   [106] The chronological data are fairly exact by modern conclusions.
   The forty-fifth year of Augustus is reckoned (as was the custom among
   the older historians, e.g. Muratori in 1744-1749) from his assumption
   of power as a triumvir in 44 B.C., and corresponds therefore to A.D. I
   (though AC had just said that Christ was born in 7 B.C.). Herod reigned
   40-4 B.C. (thirty-six years--AC says forty), and AC gives his
   thirty-fourth year for the birth of Christ, i.e. 6 B.C. There is
   therefore some confusion in the correlation of the data. For Herod's
   madness, cf. Josephus Ant., XVII, vi, 5 to viii, 1. (SB)

   [107] Josephus tells us (Ant., XV, xi, I) that Herod began the
   rebuilding of the Temple in his eighteenth year, i.e. 20-19 B.C., and
   that work continued for one and a half years (ib., 6). The Gospel (
   John 2.20), referring to the beginning of Our Lord's ministry, A.D. 29,
   mentions forty-six years of the Temple, which would give the date 17
   B.C., perhaps, for its completion. Perhaps AC's "seventeen years before
   the birth of Christ" can be understood as 17 B.C., but there is a
   slight confusion here. (SB)

   [108] The twelve Hebrew lunar months (of alternatively twenty-nine and
   thirty days) gave a year of 354 days, so that every few years an error
   accumulated which was corrected by the insertion after the twelfth
   month, Adar, of a thirteenth or intercalary month, called Second Adar.
   The need for this intercalation was, at the time of Christ, still
   determined empirically, in such a way that the celebration of the Pasch
   at the full moon or fourteenth day of the first month, Nisan, should
   always occur after the spring equinox (Mar. 21st). The intercalary
   month was of the same length as the other months, running from new moon
   to new moon. (Cf. Schürer, The Jewish People in the Time of Christ, I,
   ii, 369 sqq.) AC herself admitted the likelihood of confusion on her
   part about this technical matter. (SB)

   [109] Kislev was the ninth month, corresponding approximately to our
   Nov./Dec., and according to AC (infra, p. 119 ) Christ was born on the
   12th Kislev, which that year was Nov. 25th. (SB)

   [110] The calendar was adjusted in 1582, when by order of Pope Gregory
   XIII ten days were omitted, so that the day following Oct. 4th in that
   year was Oct. 15th, and thus the spring equinox was restored to Mar.
   21st. The ten days' error was the accumulation since the previous
   adjustment at Nicaea in A.D. 325 (cf. Breviary, De Anno et ejus
   partibus). (SB)

   [111] The ritual of lighting the Sabbath lamp on Friday evening is
   described in the Mishnah, Shabbath, II, 5-7; III, 6. The Mosaic
   prohibition of making fire on the Sabbath is in Exod. 35.3. (SB)

                         XII. THE CIRCUMCISION OF JESUS

1. PREPARATION FOR THE CIRCUMCISION. JOSEPHS FETCHS THE PRIESTS FROM BETHLEHEM.

   [DECEMBER 1 ^st:] This afternoon I saw several more people who were
   keeping the Sabbath come to the Cave of the Nativity, and in the
   evening, after the Sabbath was over, I saw the Essene women and Mary's
   maidservant preparing a meal in an arbor in front of the entrance to
   the cave. Joseph had begun to put up this arbor with the shepherds
   several days before. He had also cleared out his room at the entrance
   to the cave, covering the floor with rugs and decorating everything as
   festively as his poverty allowed. He had made all these arrangements
   before the Sabbath began, for tomorrow at daybreak is the eighth day
   from the birth of Christ, when the child must be circumcised according
   to God's commandment.

   Towards evening Joseph had gone to Bethlehem, and returned with three
   priests, an elderly man, and a woman who seemed to act as a kind of
   nurse at this solemn ceremony. She brought with her a chair specially
   kept for these occasions, and a thick octagonal stone slab containing
   what was necessary. All these things were put down on mats spread out
   at the place where the ceremony was to take place. This was at the
   entrance to the cave, not far from the Crib, between the partition
   lately removed by Joseph and the hearth-place. The chair was really a
   box and could be drawn out to form a sort of low couch with an arm at
   one side. It was covered with red material. It was more for lying than
   sitting on. The octagonal stone slab must have been over two feet in
   diameter. In its center there was an octagonal cavity covered with a
   metal plate; in it were three boxes and a stone knife in separate
   compartments. This stone slab was placed beside the chair on a
   three-legged stool, which until now had always stood, covered with a
   cloth, on the place where Our Lord was born.

   When all had been arranged, the priests greeted the Blessed Virgin and
   the Infant Jesus. They spoke friendly words to her and took the Child
   in their arms with emotion. A meal was then eaten in the arbor before
   the entrance, and a crowd of poor people (who, as always happens on
   such occasions, had followed the priests) surrounded the table and were
   given presents throughout the meal by Joseph and the priests, so that
   soon everything was distributed.

   I saw the sun go down; it looked bigger than here at home. I saw its
   low rays shining through the open door into the Cave of the Nativity.

2. THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST. THE NAME JESUS.

   [Sunday, December 2 ^nd. She does not mention whether after yesterday's
   meal the priests again returned to the town and did not come back till
   next morning, or whether they passed the night at or near the cave:]
   There were lamps lit in the cave and I saw them often praying and
   singing during the night. The circumcision took place at dawn, eight
   days after the birth of Our Lord. [112] The Blessed Virgin was
   distressed and anxious. She had herself prepared the little cloths to
   catch the blood and to bandage the Child and had kept them at her
   breast in a fold of her mantle. The octagonal stone slab was covered by
   the priests first with red and then with white. This was accompanied by
   prayers and ceremonies. One of the priests then placed himself in the
   chair, leaning back rather than sitting in it, while the Blessed
   Virgin, who was veiled and holding the Infant Jesus in her arms at the
   back of the cave, handed the Child to the maidservant together with the
   bandages. St. Joseph took Him from the maidservant and gave Him to the
   nurse who had come with the priests. She laid the little Jesus, covered
   with a veil, upon the cloth on the octagonal stone slab.

   Prayers were again offered. Then, the woman unwrapped the Child from
   His swaddling clothes and placed Him on the lap of the priest in the
   chair. St. Joseph bent down over the priest's shoulders and held the
   upper part of the Child's body. Two priests knelt to right and left,
   each holding one of the Child's feet: the one who was to perform the
   holy ceremony knelt before the Child. The cover was removed from the
   stone to disclose the three boxes with healing ointments and lotions.
   The handle and the blade of the knife were both of stone. The smooth
   brown handle had a groove into which the blade could be shut down; the
   latter was of the yellow color of raw silk, and did not seem to me to
   be sharp. The cut was made with the hook-shaped point of the blade,
   which when opened must have been nine inches long. The priest also made
   use of his sharp finger-nails for the operation. Afterwards he sucked
   the wound and dabbed it with healing lotion and some soothing substance
   from the boxes. The part that was cut off he placed between two round
   discs of some precious material, shining and reddish-brown in color,
   and slightly hollowed out in the center, making a kind of flat box.
   This was handed to the Blessed Virgin. The nurse now took the Child,
   bandaged Him, and wrapped Him again in His swaddling clothes. Up till
   now these, which were red beneath and white above, had been wound round
   up to under the arms. Now the little arms were also wrapped round, and
   the veil was wrapped round His head instead of covering it. He was then
   again laid on the octagonal slab of stone, which was covered with its
   cloths, and more prayers were said over Him. Although I know that the
   angel had told Joseph that the child was to be called Jesus, yet I
   remember that the priest did not at once approve of this name, and
   therefore fell to praying. I then saw a shining angel appear before the
   priest, holding before his eyes a tablet (like that on the Cross) with
   the name of Jesus. I do not know whether he or any of the other priests
   saw this angel as I did, but he was awe-struck, and I saw him writing
   this name by divine inspiration on a parchment.

   The Infant Jesus wept loudly after the sacred ceremony, and I saw that
   He was given back to St. Joseph. He laid Him in the arms of the Blessed
   Virgin, who was standing with two women in the back of the cave. She
   wept as she took Him, and withdrew into the corner where the Crib was.
   Here she sat down, wrapped in her veil and soothed the crying Infant by
   giving Him her breast. Joseph also gave her the little bloodstained
   cloths: the nurse kept the little bloody shreds of stuff that remained.
   Prayers were again said and hymns sung; the lamp was still burning, but
   day was breaking. After a while the Blessed Virgin came forward herself
   with the Child and laid Him down on the octagonal stone; the priests
   held out their hands to her, crossed over the Child. After this she
   retired, taking the Child with her. Before the priests left, taking
   with them all that they had brought, they ate a light meal in the arbor
   with Joseph and a few shepherds who had been standing at the entrance
   to the cave. I learnt that all those who took part in this holy
   ceremony were good people, and that the priests were later enlightened
   and obtained salvation. During the whole morning generous presents were
   given to poor people who came to the door. During the ceremony the
   donkey was tied up farther away. Today crowds of dirty, swarthy beggars
   went past the cave, carrying bundles, coming from the Valley of the
   Shepherds. They seemed to be going to Jerusalem for some feast. They
   were very violent in demanding alms, and cursed and raged horribly at
   the Crib because they were not satisfied with Joseph's presents. I do
   not know what was wrong with these people; I felt a great dislike for
   them. Today the nurse came again to the Blessed Virgin and bandaged the
   Infant Jesus. In the night that followed I saw the Child often restless
   with pain and crying a great deal. Mary and Joseph took Him in their
   arms in turns, carrying Him about and comforting Him.

3. ELIZABETH VISITS THE MANGER.

   [December 3 ^rd:] This evening I saw Elizabeth coming from Juttah to
   the Cave of the Nativity. She was riding on a donkey led by an aged
   manservant. Joseph received her very warmly, and she and Mary embraced
   each other with intense joy. She pressed the Infant Jesus to her heart
   with tears. Her couch was prepared beside the place where Jesus was
   born. In front of this place there stood sometimes a high stand like a
   sawing-trestle, with a little box on it. They often laid the Infant
   Jesus in this box, standing round Him in prayer and caressing Him. This
   must be the custom there, for I saw in Anna's house the child Mary
   lying on a similar stand. Elizabeth and Mary talked to each other in
   the sweetest intimacy.

4. FAMILIARITY BETWEEN MARY AND ELIZABETH. MARY CONFIDES HER PAINS AND JOYS.

   [December 4 ^th:] Yesterday evening and again today I saw Mary and
   Elizabeth sitting together in sweet converse, and I felt myself to be
   with them and heard all their talk with heartfelt joy. The Blessed
   Virgin told her everything that had happened to her, and when she
   described their difficulty in finding a lodging in Bethlehem, Elizabeth
   wept in sympathy. She also told her much about the birth of the Infant
   Jesus, and I can remember something of this. She said that at the time
   of the Annunciation she had lost consciousness for ten minutes and had
   felt as if her heart had grown to double its size and as if she were
   filled with inexpressible grace. At the hour of the Birth of Christ she
   had been full of endless yearning, and had been rapt in ecstasy,
   feeling as though she were uplifted, kneeling, by angels; then she had
   felt as though her heart was split in twain, and that one half had gone
   from her. She had remained thus for ten minutes without consciousness,
   then she had had a feeling of inner emptiness and an intense yearning
   for an infinite salvation outside herself, whereas before she had
   always felt that it was within her. She had then seen a glow of light
   before her, in which the form of her Child seemed to grow before her
   eyes. Then she had seen His movements and heard His crying, and coming
   to herself, had taken Him up from the ground to her breast. At first
   she had been as in a dream, and had not dared to lift up the little
   Child surrounded with radiance. She also said that she had not been
   conscious of having given birth to the Child. Elizabeth said to her:
   You have been more favored in giving birth than other women: the birth
   of John was a joy indeed, but it was otherwise than with you.' That is
   all that I remember of their talk.

   Today I saw many people visiting the Blessed Virgin and the Infant
   Jesus. I also saw a lot of ill-behaved folk like the day before going
   by and stopping at the door to demand alms, cursing and raging. Joseph
   did not give them any presents this time. Towards evening Mary again
   hid herself with the Infant Jesus and Elizabeth in the cave at the side
   of the Cave of the Nativity, and I think Mary remained there the whole
   night. This happened because all kinds of inquisitive and important
   people from Bethlehem crowded to the Crib, and the Blessed Virgin did
   not wish to be seen by them.

   Today I saw the Blessed Virgin leave the Cave of the Nativity with the
   Infant Jesus and go into another cave to the right of it. The entrance
   was very narrow, and fourteen steep steps led down first into a small
   cellar-like chamber and then into a vaulted chamber which was more
   spacious than the Cave of the Nativity. The space near the entrance was
   semicircular, and Joseph divided this oil by a hanging curtain, leaving
   a rectangular room beyond. The light fell not from above but through
   side-openings pierced in the thick rock. During the last few days I saw
   an old man clearing out of this cave a lot of brushwood and bundles of
   straw or rushes such as Joseph used for kindling. It must have been a
   shepherd who helped in this way. This cave was lighter and more
   spacious than the Cave of the Nativity. The donkey was not kept here. I
   saw the Infant Jesus lying here in a hollowed trough on the ground. In
   the last few days I often saw Mary showing her Child to visitors who
   came singly. He was covered with a veil, but otherwise had nothing on
   but a bandage round His body. At other times I saw the little Child all
   swaddled up again. I see the nurse often visiting the Child. Mary gave
   her a generous share of the gifts brought by the visitors, which she
   distributed amongst the needy in Bethlehem.

          XIII. THE JOURNEY OF THE THREE HOLY KINGS TO BETHLEHEM [113]

   [1821. Catherine Emmerich had already, in the course of 1819 and 1820,
   communicated a series of visions of the three holy kings' journey to
   Bethlehem. But, as at that time she was following the dates of the
   feasts of the Church in her contemplations, the period of thirteen days
   from Christmas to the Epiphany was too short for their long journey,
   and she communicated only some descriptions of single halting-places.
   As, however, in 1821 she dated the day of Christ's birth a month
   earlier, that is to say on November 25 ^th, and saw the departure of
   the kings for Judea on that day, there remained a space of about a
   month's time for the journey. She said, in defining its length, I
   always saw the kings approaching Bethlehem when I was putting out the
   Crib in the convent,'--that is to say, about December 25 ^th. Thus, it
   is more likely that Herod would no longer find the Child in Bethlehem
   after the departure of the kings, since the departure of the holy
   family could then have already occurred.]

1. THE KINGS SEE THE STAR AND BEGIN THEIR TRAVEL.

   [November 25 ^th :] I have already related on Christmas Day how I saw
   the Birth of Christ being announced to the kings on Christmas night. I
   saw Mensor and the dark-skinned Seir gazing at the stars from a field
   in Mensor's country. [114] Everything was prepared for their departure.
   They were on a pyramid-shaped tower looking through long tubes at the
   Star of Jacob, which had a tail. The star split asunder before their
   eyes, and I saw a great shining virgin appear therein, before whom a
   radiant child hovered in the air. At his right hand a branch grew
   forth, bearing, like a flower, a little tower with several entrances.
   This tower was finally transformed into a city. I cannot remember the
   picture completely. Immediately after seeing this picture they both
   started off. Theokeno, the third king, lived a few days' journey
   farther to the east. He saw the same star-picture in the same hour, and
   set off at once in great haste in order to overtake his two friends
   quickly, which he succeeded in doing.

   [November 26 ^th:] I went to sleep with a great longing to be with the
   Mother of God in the Cave of the Nativity, and to be given by her the
   Infant Jesus to hold in my arms for a little and to press Him to my
   heart. I did come there, at night. Joseph was asleep behind his
   partition to the right of the entrance, his head resting on his right
   arm. Mary sat at her usual place beside the Crib; she was awake, and
   held the Infant Jesus to her breast under her veil. When she sat
   watching in the daytime, a piece of her coverlet was rolled up to make
   a pillow behind her back as a support; now, at night, she lay back on
   her couch so that her head was lower. I fell on my knees and prayed
   with great longing that I might hold the Child for a little. Ah, she
   knew well what I wanted: she knows everything and accepts everything
   with such loving, touching sympathy if one prays with real faith; but
   she was so still, so quiet and so full of adoring mother-love, and she
   did not give me the Child--I think because she was suckling Him. I
   would not have either. But my longing increased continually, and joined
   in the stream of longing of all the souls who yearn for the Infant
   Jesus. This burning desire for Our Savior was, however, nowhere so
   pure, innocent, child-like, and true as in the hearts of the beloved
   holy kings from the East, all of whose ancestors had for centuries
   waited for Him, in faith, hope, and love. So my longing drew me then to
   them, and when I had finished my adoration, I crept softly and
   reverently out of the cave, so as to make no disturbance, and was taken
   on a long journey, in the train of the three holy kings. On this
   journey I saw many things--many strange countries and dwellings and
   many different peoples, their clothes and their manners and customs as
   well as many idolatrous ceremonies that they performed; but I have
   forgotten most of it. I will relate as well as I can what still remains
   clear in my memory.

   I was taken eastwards to a region where I had never been before. It was
   mostly sand and desert. On some of the hills lived people in groups of
   five to eight, like families, inhabiting huts made of brushwood. The
   brushwood roof was built against the hill out of which the living-rooms
   were hollowed. On going in, I saw that the huts were divided into rooms
   by partitions. The front and back rooms were larger than the central
   ones. Nothing at all grew in that region but low bushes, and here and
   there a little tree bearing buds out of which the people pulled white
   wool. Besides these I saw a few larger trees under which they had
   placed their idols. These men must have been still in a very wild
   state, for they seemed to me to eat little but meat, and even the raw
   flesh of birds. They seemed to live partly by robbery. They were as
   dark as copper and had foxy yellow hair. They were small, thick-set,
   and rather fat, but very skilful, agile, and active. They seemed to
   have no domestic animals and no flocks or herds. They wore, I saw, but
   little clothing. [Please refer to Figure 17.] The men had short aprons
   hanging in folds under their girdle before and behind, and wore on
   their breast a sort of narrow diagonally ribbed scapulary, fastened
   across the shoulders and round the neck. This narrow breast-covering
   seemed to be elastic and could be pulled out longer. Their whole back
   down to the girdle was uncovered except for the strap across the
   shoulders. On their heads they wore hoods tied round with a band, and
   having a sort of rosette or knot on the forehead. The women wore short
   skirts half-way down to the knee; the breast and the lower part of the
   body was covered with what looked like the front of a jacket, the edge
   of which came down to the girdle. This garment was closed at the neck
   with a strip of stuff of the shape and size of a stole; it was
   scalloped round the shoulders, but plain over the breast. Their
   head-covering was a cap crowned by a button shaped like a truncated
   goblet. This cap was drawn down to make a point over the forehead, and
   covered the ears and part of the cheek. Behind the ears and at the back
   of the head this cap had loose flaps of stuff between which cushions of
   hair could be seen. The breast-covering of the women was colored, and
   was quilted or embroidered with yellow and green designs. It was
   decorated in front down the middle with buttons and scalloped on the
   shoulders. The embroidery was rather coarse, as on old vestments. Their
   upper arms were covered with bracelets.

   Figure 17. An Eastern man and woman making wool cords.

   These people made blankets or something like them out of the white
   wool, which they took from the buds of the little trees. Two of them
   tied a wad of this wool round their bodies, and each walked backwards
   away from the other, spinning from the wool round the other one's body
   a very long cord as thick as a finger. These cords they then plaited
   together to make broad strips. When they had prepared a great number of
   them, they went in troops, bearing great rolls of these blankets on
   their heads, to sell them in a town.

   Here and there in this region I saw their idols under great trees. They
   had heads of horned oxen with wide-open mouths, and lower down in their
   body was a wider opening where fire was lit, to burn the offerings
   placed in the smaller openings. Round these idol-trees stood little
   stone pillars on each of which were small figures of other animals,
   such as birds, dragons, and a figure with three dogs' heads and a
   coiled snake's tail.

   At the beginning of my journey I had the feeling of there being a great
   piece of water to my right from which I was, however, always going
   farther away. After I had left the region inhabited by these people, my
   path continually ascended, and I had to cross a mountain ridge of white
   sand, covered in many places with all kinds of little broken black
   stones, like broken pots and dishes. On the farther side of this ridge
   I came down a valley into a region covered with many trees growing in
   almost regular rows. There were trees there with scaly trunks and
   enormous leaves, also pyramid-shaped ones with very big, beautiful
   flowers; these last had yellowish-green leaves and branches with buds.
   I also saw trees with quite smooth heart-shaped leaves.

   Thereafter I came into a region consisting of wide endless
   pasture-lands between hills, where there were countless flocks and
   herds of different kinds. Vines grew on the slopes of the hills, and
   were cultivated, for there were rows of them on terraces, protected by
   little wattle fences. The owners of the herds lived in tents with flat
   roofs; the entrance was closed by a door of light wickerwork. These
   tents were made of the white woolen stuff woven by the wild people I
   had seen, but they were covered over with pieces of brownish stuff
   overlapping each other like scales and hanging down in a shaggy edge.
   They looked as if they were made of moss or fur. One big tent stood in
   the middle, and many smaller ones in a wide circle round it. The flocks
   and herds, divided according to their kind, went out into the wide
   pastures, interspersed here and there in the distance with expanses of
   bushes, like low woods. I was able to distinguish herds of very
   different kinds of animals. I saw sheep with fleeces of long twisted
   wool and long woolly tails, and also very agile animals with horns like
   he-goats: these were as big as calves; others were the size of the
   horses which run wild on our moors at home. I also saw droves of camels
   and animals like them only with two humps. In one place I saw some
   elephants in an enclosure, white ones and spotted ones; they were quite
   tame and were used only for domestic work.

   In this vision I was thrice interrupted by having my attention turned
   in other directions, but I always came back-- though at another time of
   day--to this picture of pastoral activity. These herds and pasturages
   seemed to me to belong to one of the kings now on their travels: I
   think it was Mensor and his family. They were tended by under-shepherds
   wearing coats reaching to the knee, rather like the coats worn by our
   peasants, only that they fitted tight round the body. I think that now
   that their chief was going away for some long time, all the herds were
   being examined and counted by overseers, and the under-shepherds had to
   render account, for from time to time I saw more important people
   arriving in long cloaks and inspecting everything. They went into the
   big central tent, and the herds were then driven past between it and
   the small tents to be counted and looked at. The persons who received
   the reckonings had in their hands tablets, I do not know of what
   material, on which they wrote something. I thought as I watched them:
   How I wish our bishops would examine as diligently the flocks in the
   care of their under-shepherds.'

   When I again returned to the pasturages after the last interruption, it
   was night. A deep stillness rested on the place. Most of the shepherds
   were asleep under the small tents, only a few crept about, watching
   over the sleeping herds. These lay at rest in great enclosures, divided
   according to their kind, some crowded together and some less so. It was
   for me a deeply moving and edifying sight--this great pasture full of
   peacefully sleeping herds, the servants of mankind, and above them the
   immeasurable expanse of the deep-blue pastures of heaven, filled with
   countless stars--stars which had come forth at the bidding of their
   almighty Creator. They follow the voice of their shepherd like true
   sheep with greater obedience than the sheep of earth give to their
   mortal shepherds. And, when I saw the waking shepherds wandering to and
   fro and turning their eyes more to the starry flocks above than to the
   earthly ones below who were entrusted to their care, I thought within
   myself: they are right to look up in astonishment and gratitude to
   where their ancestors have for centuries turned their expectant gaze in
   longing and prayer. The good shepherd seeks for the lost sheep and
   rests not till he has found it and brought it home; so does the
   Heavenly Father, the true Shepherd of all these countless flocks of
   stars in immeasurable space. When man, whom He had made lord of the
   earth, sinned, and as a punishment the earth became cursed to him, God
   sought out fallen man and his home the earth like the lost sheep. He
   even sent down His only-begotten Son to become man, to bring the lost
   sheep home, to take upon Himself as the Lamb of God, the sins of
   mankind, and, by dying Himself, to make satisfaction for those sins to
   the divine justice. And now the coming of the promised Redeemer was at
   hand, and the kings of these shepherds, led by a star, had set forth
   the night before to pay homage to the newborn Redeemer. That was why
   the watchers of the flocks looked up in awe and adoration to the
   heavenly pastures, for the Shepherd of the shepherds came down from
   above, and His coming was announced first of all to the shepherds.

   While I was meditating on all this in the wide pasture-land, I was
   aware of the stillness of the night being broken by the sound of hoofs
   hurriedly approaching: it was a troop of men riding on camels. They
   passed quickly by the sleeping herds to the main tent of the shepherds'
   encampment. Woken by the noise, some of the camels got up from their
   sleeping position and stretched their long necks towards the riders,
   and lambs woke up bleating. Some of the new-corners alighted from their
   beasts and woke the sleeping shepherds in the tents, while the nearest
   herdsmen came up to greet the riders. Soon all were awake and gathered
   round the new arrivals; there was much talking, and all looked and
   pointed at the stars. They were speaking of a star or of some
   apparition in the heavens, which must have already disappeared, for I
   did not see it. These newcomers were Theokeno and his train. He was the
   third king and the one who lived farthest away. He had seen in his home
   the same picture in the skies, and had at once set forth and journeyed
   to this place. He asked how far ahead of him Mensor and Seir might be,
   and whether the star whose guidance they had followed could still be
   seen. After receiving the news for which he asked, Theokeno and his
   followers went on their way quickly without any delay. This was the
   place where the three kings, coming from their separate homes, used
   generally to meet to observe the stars. The pyramidal tower, from which
   they looked at the stars through long tubes, was close by. Theokeno
   lived farther away than the others, beyond the region which was
   Abraham's first dwelling-place. They all lived near that region.

2. VISIONS OF ABRAHAM, HAGAR, AND ISHMAEL.

   In the intervals between the visions of the three days during which I
   saw what was happening on that wide pasture-land, I was shown much
   about the places in which Abraham lived, but have forgotten most of it.
   Once, in the distance, I saw the mountain on which Abraham was
   preparing to sacrifice Isaac. Another time I was shown very clearly
   Hagar and Ishmael in the desert, although this happened a long way from
   here. I cannot remember in what connection this was. Abraham's first
   dwelling-place was high up, and the lands of the three kings were below
   and round it. I will here describe the picture of Ishmael and Hagar.
   [115]

   At the side of Abraham's mountain, more towards the lower part of the
   valley, I saw Hagar and her son wandering about in the bushes; she
   seemed quite beside herself. The boy was only a few years old and was
   wearing a long dress. His mother was wrapped in a long cloak which
   covered her head; under it she wore a short dress, the upper part of
   which was tight round her body, and her arms, too, were tightly wrapped
   round. She laid the child under a tree on a hill, and made signs on his
   forehead, on the middle of his right upper arm, on his breast, and on
   his left upper arm. When she went away I did not see the mark on his
   forehead, but the other marks, which had been made on his clothing,
   remained visible as if drawn in red-brown color. These marks were in
   the form of a cross, but not an ordinary one. They were like a Maltese
   cross, only the points of the four triangles were arranged in the shape
   of a cross round a ring. In the four triangles she wrote signs or
   letters, like hooks, whose significance I could not clearly retain in
   my mind; I saw her also write two or three letters in the ring, in the
   middle. She drew this very rapidly with some red color, which she
   seemed to have in her hand (or perhaps it was blood). As she did this
   she kept her thumb and forefinger pressed together. Thereupon she
   turned round, gazed up to heaven, and did not look round again at her
   son. She went about a gun-shot's distance away and sat down under a
   tree. She heard a voice from heaven; rose up and went farther away.
   Again she heard a voice, and saw a spring of water under the leaves.
   She filled her leather water-bottle at the spring, and going back to
   her son gave him to drink and led him to the spring, where she put
   another garment over the one she had marked with crosses. That is what
   I remember of this vision. I think that I saw Hagar in the desert twice
   before, once before the birth of her son, and the second time with the
   young Ishmael as now.

3. THEOKENO CATCHES UP TO THE TRAIN OF MENSOR AND SAIR IN A DESERTED CITY.

   [The night of November 27 ^th-28 ^th. When Catherine Emmerich
   communicated in 1821 these visions of the journey of the three holy
   kings, she had already related the whole of Jesus' earthly ministry,
   and had amongst other things seen how, after the raising of Lazarus
   (which she saw happening on September 7 ^th of the third year of His
   ministry), He withdrew beyond the Jordan. During His sixteen weeks'
   absence there, He visited the three holy kings who on their return from
   their journey to Bethlehem had settled all together, with their
   attendants, nearer to the Promised Land. [116] Only Mensor and Theokeno
   were alive then. The dark-skinned Seir was in his grave when Jesus came
   there. It seems necessary to inform the reader about these events
   (which were thirty-two years later in date but described earlier by
   Catherine Emmerich) in order that certain references to them in what
   follows may be understandable.]

   In the night of the 27 ^th to the 28 ^th of November I saw, as day
   began to dawn, Theokeno and his retinue overtake Mensor and Seir, after
   whom they had been hurrying, in a deserted city with great rows of
   isolated high columns. By the gates, which were square ruined towers,
   and in other places stood many large and beautiful statues not so stiff
   as in Egypt but in beautiful living attitudes. This region was very
   sandy and rocky. In the ruins of this deserted city people who looked
   like bands of robbers had settled themselves. They wore nothing but a
   skin round their bodies and carried spears in their hands. They were
   brown in color, short, and stocky, but remarkably agile. (I had a
   feeling that I had been in this place before, perhaps on those journeys
   which I made in my dreams to the mountain of the Prophet and the river
   Ganges.) After the three kings and their followers had met here, they
   left at dawn in haste to continue their journey. Many of the rabble who
   lived here joined them because of the kings' generosity. (After
   Christ's death two disciples, Saturnin and Jonadab, the half-brother of
   Peter, were sent by St. John the Evangelist to this deserted city to
   preach the Gospel. [117] )

4. THE HISTORICAL COLORS AND NAMES OF THE THREE HOLY KINGS.

   I now saw all the three holy kings together. The last arrival was the
   one who lived farthest away, Theokeno. His face was of a beautiful
   yellowish color. (I recognized him as the one who was lying ill in his
   tent, when thirty-two years later Jesus visited the kings in their
   settlement nearer the Promised Land.) Each of the three kings had with
   him four near relations or friends of his family, so that, counting the
   kings, there were fifteen important people of the party, besides the
   crowd of servants and camel-drivers that followed them. Amongst the
   many youths in their retinue, who were quite naked from the waist
   upwards, and were astonishingly agile in leaping and running, I
   recognized the young Eleazar, who later became a martyr and of whom I
   possess a relic. [118]

   [In the afternoon, when her confessor again asked her for the names of
   the three holy kings, she answered, Mensor, the brown-faced one, after
   Christ's death received the name of Leander on his baptism by St.
   Thomas. Theokeno, the old, yellow-faced one, who was ill when Jesus
   visited Mensor's camp in Arabia, was baptized Leo by St. Thomas. The
   brown-skinned one, who was already dead when Jesus made His visit, was
   called Seir or Sair.' Her confessor asked her: How then was he
   baptized?' She answered smiling and without hesitation: He was already
   dead and had received the baptism of desire.' Her confessor then said:
   I have never heard these names in my life: how then did they get the
   names of Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar?' She replied: They were
   called this because it goes with their character, for these names mean:
   (1) He goes with love; (2) He wanders about, he approaches gently and
   with ingratiating manners: (3) He makes rapid decisions, he quickly
   directs his will to the will of God.' She said this with great
   friendliness, and expressed the meaning of the names by making
   pantomimic gestures with her hand on the bed-coverlet. It must remain
   for the language experts to decide how far these words can be made to

5. THE TRAIN OF THE THREE HOLY KINGS RESTS AT A SPRING.

   [November 28 ^th:] It was not, I think, until a half-day's journey from
   the deserted city with its many columns and statues that I first really
   joined the three kings and their train. It was in a more fertile
   region. One could see shepherds' dwellings here and there, with walls
   of black and white stones. The travelers came to a spring of water in
   the plain near which there were several large sheds, open at the side.
   Three stood in the middle with others round them. This seemed to be a
   customary halting-place for caravans. I saw that the whole procession
   was divided into three separate parties; each had five leaders, one
   being the chief or king, who, like a master of the house, saw to
   everything, gave orders, and apportioned the work. The members of each
   of these three parties had faces of different colors. Mensor's tribe
   was of a pleasing brownish color, Seir's was brown, and Theokeno's a
   bright yellow. I saw none shining black in color except some slaves,
   who were in all three parties. The leaders sat on their high-loaded
   beasts between bundles covered with carpets. They had staffs in their
   hands. They were followed by other beasts, almost as big as horses and
   ridden by servants and slaves with luggage. When they arrived at the
   halting-place they dismounted, unloaded the beasts completely and
   watered them at the spring, which was surrounded by a little rampart on
   which was a wall with three openings in it. The cistern was at the
   bottom of this enclosure; it had a fountain with three water-pipes
   closed by pegs. The cistern was covered with a lid, which a man who had
   come with them from the deserted city opened in return for a fee. They
   had leather vessels, which could be folded up quite flat, with four
   partitions. These were filled with water, and four camels always drank
   from them at the same time. They were very careful with the water, and
   not a drop was allowed to be wasted. After drinking, the camels were
   led into open enclosures near the spring, each in a separate
   compartment. Fodder which had been brought with them was shaken out
   into the stone troughs in front of them; it consisted of grains of the
   size of acorns (perhaps beans). Amongst the baggage there were also big
   square bird-cages, narrow and high, hanging by the sides of the camels
   under the larger packages. In these were birds, single or in couples,
   according to their size; they were as big as pigeons or liens, and were
   kept in separate compartments as food on the journey. They carried
   their loaves of bread, which were all of the same size, in leather
   cases, packing the slabs tightly together and taking out only so much
   as they needed each time. They had with them very costly vessels of
   yellow metal, some of them ornamented with precious stones. These were
   almost exactly like our chalices and incense-boats in shape; they drank
   from them and handed round food on them. The rims of most of these
   vessels were set with red jewels.

   The three tribes differed somewhat in their clothing. [Please refer to
   Figure 18.] Theokeno, the yellow-skinned, and his family, as well as
   Mensor, the light-brown one, wore high hoods embroidered in colors with
   a strip of thick white stuff wound round them. Their coats, which were
   very simple, with few buttons or ornaments on the breast, reached
   almost to their ankles. They wrapped themselves in light cloaks, very
   full and flowing, so that they trailed on the ground behind them. Seir,
   the brown-skinned one, and his family wore caps with little white pads
   and round hoods embroidered in colors on which was a disc of another
   color. Their cloaks were shorter than the others', but longer at the
   back than in front; their coats were buttoned to the knee and were
   decorated at the breast with braid and tinsel and thickly set with
   shining buttons. On one side of the breast they wore a shining little
   shield like a star. All wore sandals, the soles of which were fastened
   round their bare feet with cords. The more important ones had short
   swords or long knives in their girdles, with many pouches and boxes
   hanging from their waists. Amongst the kings and their families were
   men of fifty, forty, thirty, and twenty years of age. Some had long and
   some short beards. The servants and camel-drivers were dressed much
   more simply, some wearing only one piece of stuff or an old blanket.

   Figure 18. Two of the three kings: Theokeno and Seir.

   When the camels had been watered, fed, and stabled, the travelers,
   after drinking, made a fire in the middle of the shed under which they
   had camped. The firewood consisted of pieces some two and a half feet
   long brought by poor people from near by in very neat bundles; they
   seemed to have a store of it ready for travelers. The kings made a
   triangular fireplace and piled up the long pieces round it, leaving an
   opening on one side for the draught. It was very cleverly arranged. I
   am not sure how they made fire: I saw that one of them kept turning one
   piece of wood in another, as if in a box, and then pulled it out
   alight. They then lit the fire, and I saw them kill some of the birds
   and roast them. Each of the three kings acted towards his tribe like
   the head of a family: he distributed the food, laying the carved-up
   birds and little loaves of bread on small howls or plates standing on
   short feet, and handed them round. In the same way he filled the
   goblets and gave drink to each. The lower servants, among whom there
   were Moors, lie on a blanket on the ground at one side of the fire,
   patiently awaiting their turn. They, too, receive their due share. I
   think that these are slaves.

   O, how touching is the good temper and childlike simplicity of these
   beloved kings! They give to those who come to them a share of all they
   have; they even hold the golden vessels to their lips and let them
   drink out of them, like children.

6. ABOUT THE HOMELANDS AND LENGTHS OF THE JOURNEYS OF THE THREE HOLY KINGS.

   Today I learnt much about the holy kings, including the names of their
   countries and cities, but in my helpless and agitated condition I have
   quite forgotten everything. I will tell what I know. Mensor, the
   brown-skinned one, was a Chaldean; his city had a name like Acajaja
   [120] and was surrounded by a river, like an island. Mensor spent all
   his time in the fields with his herds. Seir, the dark-skinned one, was
   on Christmas night all ready to start on his journey from home. The
   name of his country is connected in my memory with the sound
   Partherme.' [121] Beyond his country, and higher up, was a lake or sea.
   It was only he and his tribe who were so brown, with red lips; the
   people round were white. His country was quite small, no bigger than
   the province of Münster.

   Theokeno, the pale one, came from a country still higher up, called
   Media, lying between two seas. [122] I have forgotten the name of the
   city in which he lived; it was an assemblage of tents erected on
   foundations of stones. Theokeno, the richest of the three, was the one
   who left most behind him. I believe that he could have taken a more
   direct way to Bethlehem, and had to make a detour in order to travel in
   company with the others. I almost think that he had to go by Babylon to
   join them.

   Seir, the dark-skinned one, lived three days' journey from the home of
   Mensor, the brown one, and Theokeno five days' journey. Each day's
   journey was reckoned as lasting twelve hours. Mensor and Seir were
   together in the former's camp when they saw the vision of the star of
   Jesus' Birth, and started off the next day with their followers.

   Theokeno, the pale one, saw the same vision in his home, and hurried
   after them in great haste, catching up with the other two in the
   deserted city. I did know the length of their journey to Bethlehem, but
   have partly forgotten it. What I remember, more or less, is that their
   journey was about 700 hours and still another figure with six in it.
   They had about sixty days' journey, each reckoned at twelve hours, but
   they performed it in thirty-three days owing to the great speed of
   their beasts and to their often traveling day and night.

   The star which led them was really like a round ball with light
   streaming out of it as from a mouth. It always seemed to me as if this
   ball, which was as it were swinging on a shaft of light, was guided by
   the hand of a supernatural being. In the daytime I saw a light brighter
   than daylight going before them. If one considers the distance they had
   to travel, the speed of their journey seems astonishing, but the pace
   of their beasts was so light and even that I see them moving onward
   with the order, rapidity, and rhythm of a flight of migrating birds.
   The homes of the three kings were at the three points of a triangle.
   Mensor, the brown one, and Seir, the dark, lived nearer to each other
   than Theokeno, the pale one, who was the farthest away of the three.
   They have, I think, already passed Chaldar where I once saw the
   enclosed garden in the temple. Theokeno's distant city has only its
   foundations of stone; above, it

   is all tents. There is water round it. It seems to me about the size of
   Münster.

   After the kings had rested here until the evening, the people who had
   attached themselves to their company helped them to pack their baggage
   onto their beasts, and then carried home with them everything that was
   left behind. It was towards evening when they started off. The star was
   visible and was today reddish in color, like the moon in windy weather.
   Its long tail of light was pale. They went on foot for a while beside
   their beasts with uncovered heads, praying. On this part of the way it
   was impossible to go fast. Later on, when they came to level ground,
   they mounted their beasts, which moved at a very quick pace. Sometimes
   they went more slowly, and then they all sang as they journeyed through
   the night; it was very moving to hear.

7. NIGHT TRAVEL OF THE KINGS.

   [November 29 ^th to December 2 ^nd:] I was again with the kings on
   their journey in the night of Thursday, November 29 ^th, and during the
   following day. I cannot say enough how much I admired the order,
   nobility, and joyfulness which inspires all that they do. We are
   journeying through the night, always following the star, whose long
   tail reaches down to earth. These good men follow it with their eyes
   quietly and joyfully, talking to each other from their high saddles.
   Sometimes they sing short sentences by turns, in a very slow and
   beautiful melody, sometimes very high and sometimes deep in tone. It is
   very moving to hear it in the quiet night, and I feel all that they
   sing. They travel with perfect orderliness; first comes a big camel
   with boxes on each side of his hump covered with large carpets on which
   sits the leader with a goad in his hand and a sack at his side. Then
   follow smaller beasts, such as horses or big donkeys, carrying packages
   and ridden by the men belonging to this leader. Then comes another of
   the leaders on a camel and so on. The creatures walk so delicately with
   big steps, and put down their feet as if they were trying not to crush
   anything.

   They carry their burdens with so little motion that it seems as though
   only their legs were alive, and the carriage of their heads on their
   long necks is wonderfully calm and quiet. The men, too, seem to do
   everything without having to take thought about it. Everything happens
   as in a quiet dream, peaceful and sweet. (I cannot help reflecting here
   how these good people, who as yet do not know the Lord, journey towards
   Him in such order, peace, and sweetness, while we, whom He has redeemed
   and loaded with graces, are so disorderly and disrespectful in our
   processions!) I think the region through which they passed tonight
   might well be the district between Atom, the home of Azarias, and the
   castle of the idolater, where I saw Jesus at the end of the third year
   of His ministry when He was journeying through Arabia on His way to
   Egypt.

   On Friday, November 30 ^th, I saw the procession halting at night by a
   fountain in the fields. A man from a hut, of which there were several
   near by, opened the fountain for them. They watered their beasts and
   rested for a short time without unloading. On Saturday, December 1 ^st,
   I saw the kings, whose road had been going uphill the day before, on
   higher ground. On their right was a mountain range, and when their road
   descended again, they seemed to be in a place where houses, trees, and
   fountains often stood beside the road. It seemed to me to be the home
   of the people whom I had seen, last year and again lately, spinning and
   weaving cotton. They had stretched the threads between the trees and
   plaited broad coverings out of them. They worshipped images of oxen.
   They were generous in giving food to the rabble that followed the
   procession of the kings, but it surprised me to see that they never
   used the bowls again from which these had eaten.

   On Sunday, December 2 ^nd, I saw the three holy kings near a place
   whose name I remember as something like Causur, a city of tents on
   stone foundations. [123] They were given hospitality here by another
   king, to whom this city belonged. His tent-dwelling stood a little
   distance before it. Since their meeting in the deserted city, they had
   now traveled fifty-three or sixty-three hours. They told the king of
   Causur all that they had seen in the stars. He was very astonished, and
   looked through a tube at the star that was guiding them and saw in it a
   little child with a cross. He begged them to tell him everything on
   their return, when he would erect altars to the King and make
   sacrifices to Him. I am curious to see if he will keep his word when
   they return. I heard them recounting to him the origin of their
   star-watching, and remember of their conversation what follows.

8. THE ANCESTORS OF THE KINGS. THEIR STAR OBSERVATIONS - JACOB'S LADDER AND ITS
PROPHESIES.

   The ancestors of the kings descended from Job, who once lived in the
   Caucasus and possessed other far-off lands [124] About 1,500 years
   before the birth of Christ only one tribe of them remained there. The
   prophet Balaam came from that region, [125] and one of his disciples
   spread abroad and expounded in that land his master's prophecy, A star
   shall rise out of Jacob [see Numbers 24.17]. He had many followers, and
   they built a high tower upon a mountain, where many wise men and those
   learned in the stars lived by turns. I have seen that tower; it was
   like a mountain itself, broad at the base and pointed at the top. I
   saw, too, the openings in it where they lived. All that they discovered
   in the stars was noted and handed down by word of mouth. There were
   times when this observation of the stars fell into disuse owing to
   various happenings, and later it degenerated into the idolatrous horror
   of sacrificing children in order to hasten the coming of the promised
   Child.

   About 500 years before the birth of Christ the observation of the stars
   had lapsed. At this time the race consisted of three tribes, founded by
   three brothers who lived with their families apart from each other.
   They had three daughters to whom God had given the spirit of prophecy
   and who wandered about the land in long cloaks prophesying, and
   teaching about the star and the Child that was to come out of Jacob. In
   this way the observation of the stars and the longing for the Child was
   again revived in these three tribes. The three holy kings were
   descended from these three brothers in a direct line of fifteen
   generations, covering some 500 years. Their complexions had, however,
   become different from each other as the result of intermarriage with
   other races.

   For 500 years the ancestors of the kings had met at a building which
   they shared in common for the observation of the stars. According to
   what they saw, various alterations were made in their temple and its
   services. Unfortunately, for a long time they continued to sacrifice
   children and other human beings. As they watched the stars, they were
   shown in wonderful visions all the special events and times connected
   with the coming of the Messiah. I saw many of these visions as they
   conversed, but can no longer describe them clearly. Since Mary's
   conception, fifteen years before, these visions had pointed ever more
   distinctly to the nearness of the Child. At last they had seen several
   indications of the Passion of Jesus.

   They were able to calculate very exactly the coming of the star
   prophesied by Balaam, for they had seen Jacob's Ladder and were able to
   reckon precisely, as in a calendar, the approach of our salvation by
   the number of rungs in the ladder and by the pictures appearing on
   each. The end of the ladder led to the star, which was the uppermost
   picture on it. They saw Jacob's Ladder as a tree in the midst of which
   three rows of rungs were fastened, and on these appeared a series of
   pictures which they saw in the star as each was fulfilled, so they knew
   exactly which must be the next picture, and the intervals between the
   pictures told them how long they must wait for it. At the time of
   Mary's conception they had seen the Virgin holding a scepter and an
   evenly balanced scales with wheat and grapes. [Please refer to Figure
   19.] A little below her they saw the Virgin with the Child. They saw
   Bethlehem as a beautiful palace, a house where much blessing was stored
   and distributed. In it they saw the Virgin and Child surrounded by a
   great glory of light, and many kings bowing before Him and making
   offerings to Him. They also saw the heavenly Jerusalem, but between it
   and Bethlehem was a dark street, full of thorns, strife, and blood.

   All this was real to them. They thought that glory such as this
   surrounded the newborn King, and that all peoples were bowing before
   Him; that was why they came, bringing their gifts with them. They took
   the heavenly Jerusalem to be His earthly kingdom and thought they would
   come to it. The dark street they thought meant their own journey, or
   that some war was threatening the King; they did not know that it meant
   His Via Dolorosa. At the foot of the ladder they saw (as did I) an
   elaborate tower, like the one I saw on the mountain of the Prophet.
   They saw how the Virgin once took refuge in a storm under a projecting
   portion of this tower, which had many entrances. I cannot remember what
   this signified. (Perhaps the Flight into Egypt.) There was a whole
   series of pictures on this Jacob's Ladder, amongst others many
   prophetic symbols of the Blessed Virgin, such as the sealed fountain
   and the enclosed garden. There were also pictures of kings, some
   holding out scepters, and others, branches to each other.

   All these pictures they saw appearing in their turn in the stars as
   they were fulfilled. In the last three nights they saw these pictures
   continuously. The chief one of the three sent messengers to the others,
   and when they saw the picture of the kings making offerings to the
   newborn Child, they hurried on their way with their rich gifts, not
   wishing to be the last to arrive. All the tribes of the star-gazers had
   seen the star, but these were the only ones who followed it. The star
   which went before them was not the comet, but a shining brilliance
   borne by an angel. By day they followed the angel.

   Figure 19. Vision of the three kings at the time of Mary's conception.

   Because of all this they were full of expectation as they journeyed,
   and were afterwards astonished to find nothing like it. They were
   dismayed by Herod's reception of them and by the ignorance of all men
   about these things. When they came to Bethlehem and saw a desolate
   cellar instead of the glorious palace they had seen in the star, great
   doubt assailed them; but they remained true to their faith, and at the
   sight of Jesus they realized that all they had seen in the stars was
   fulfilled.

   These observations of the stars were accompanied by fasting, prayer,
   religious ceremonies, and various forms of self-denial and
   purification. The visions did not come from looking at one single star,
   but from a grouping of certain separate stars. This star-worship
   exercised an evil influence on those who had a tendency towards evil.
   Such people were seized with violent convulsions in their star-gazing,
   and it was they who were responsible for the misguided sacrifices of
   children. Others, like the three holy kings, saw the pictures clearly
   and calmly, in a spirit of inner piety, and grew ever better and more
   devout.

9. THE KINGS TRAIN IS AUGMENTED WITH OTHER TRAVELERS.

   [December 3 ^rd to 5 ^th:] When the kings left Causur, I saw that they
   were joined by a considerable number of distinguished travelers who
   were going the same way. On December 3 ^rd and 4 ^th I saw them
   crossing a wide plain. On the 5 ^th they rested by a fountain but
   without unloading. They watered and fed their beasts and prepared food
   for themselves.

   [In the last few days Catherine Emmerich while asleep in the evening
   often sang several short verses with very strange and moving melodies.
   When she was asked the reason for this, she said:] I am singing with my
   dear kings, they sing with great sweetness many short verses, such as:

   Over the hills let us make our way Our homage to the new King to pay.

   They take it in turn to invent and sing these verses: one begins, and
   the others repeat the verse he has sung. Then another starts another
   verse, and so as they ride along they keep up their sweet and heartfelt
   singing.

   In the heart of the star, or rather of the globe of light, which went
   before them to show them the way, I saw the appearance of a Child with
   a Cross. When they saw the appearance of the Virgin in the stars at the
   birth of Jesus, this globe of light appeared in front of the picture
   and suddenly began to move gently forward.

10. THE BLESSED VIRGIN FORESEES THE APPROACH OF THE THREE HOLY KINGS.

   [December 5 ^th:] Mary had had a vision of the approach of the three
   holy kings while they were resting in the tent of the king of Causur.
   She also saw that the latter intended to erect an altar in honor of her
   Child. She told this to St. Joseph and Elizabeth, and asked that they
   should clear out the Cave of the Nativity and make everything ready in
   time for the reception of the kings.

   The people because of whom Mary had yesterday retreated into the other
   cave were visitors who had come out of curiosity. There were many such
   in the last few days. Today Elizabeth went home to Juttah with a
   servant who came to fetch her.

   [December 6 ^th to 8 ^th:] These were quieter days in the Cave of the
   Nativity, and the Holy Family was generally alone. Only Mary's
   maidservant, a robust, serious, and unpretentious person of some thirty
   years, was there. She was a childless widow, related to Anna, who had
   given her a home. Her late husband had been very severe with her
   because she went so often to the Essenes, for she was very devout and
   was hoping for the salvation of Israel. So he was angry with her, just
   as today bad men are angry because their wives go to church too often.
   He left her and afterwards died.

   In the last few days there came no more of those insistent beggars who
   had demanded alms at the cave with curses and abuse. They were on their
   way to Jerusalem for the Maccabees' Feast of the Consecration of the
   Temple. [126] This feast really begins on the 25 ^th day of the month
   Kislev, but as this fell on the evening of Friday, December 7 ^th, in
   the year of Jesus' birth, that is to say, on the eve of the Sabbath, it
   was postponed to the evening of Saturday, December 8 ^th, or the 26 ^th
   day of Kislev. It lasted eight days.

   (Thus the sixth day after the Circumcision was the 25 ^th day of
   Kislev, so that the Circumcision happened on the nineteenth day of
   Kislev, and Jesus' birth on the twelfth day of Kislev.)

   Joseph kept the Sabbath under the lamp in the Cave of the Nativity with
   Mary and the maidservant. On Saturday evening the Feast of the
   Consecration of the Temple began. Joseph had fastened lamp-brackets, in
   three places in the cave, on each of which he lit seven little lamps.
   All is quiet now; the many visitors came because they were on their way
   to the festival. The nurse came to Mary every day now. Anna often sends
   messengers with presents who take news back to her. Jewish women do not
   suckle their children for long without other nourishment, and even when
   He was only a few days old the Infant Jesus was given a pap made of the
   pith of some rush which is light, nourishing, and sweet to taste. In
   the day-time the donkey is generally outside at pasture and only spends
   the night in the cave.

11. JOSEPH CELEBRATES THE FEAST OF THE CONSECRATION OF THE TEMPLE.

   [December 10 ^th:] Yesterday, Sunday, December 9 ^th, I did not see the
   nurse coming to the cave any more. Joseph lights his little lamps for
   the Consecration feast every morning and evening. It is very quiet here
   since the feast began in Jerusalem.

   Today a manservant came from Anna. He brought the Blessed Virgin,
   amongst other things, materials for making a girdle, and a most
   beautiful little basket of fruit, covered over with fresh roses among
   the fruit. The basket was high and narrow, and the color of the roses
   different from ours: it was paler, almost flesh-colored. There were
   also big yellow and white roses, some open, and some in bud. Mary
   seemed delighted with them and placed the basket beside her.

   [Journey of the kings:] In the last few days I often saw the kings on
   their journey. The road was more hilly, and they came over the hills
   which I had seen covered with little pieces of stone like broken
   pottery. I should very much like to have some of them; they are so
   beautifully smooth. On other mountains in that region are many white
   transparent stones like birds' eggs, and a quantity of white sand. I
   saw the kings now in the place where they afterwards lived when Jesus
   visited them in the third year of His ministry. They were not in the
   city of tents, for at that time it did not exist.

12. JOSEPH WANTS TO SETTLE DOWN IN BETHLEHEM.

   [December 11 ^th to 13 ^th:] It seems to me as if Joseph would like to
   stay in Bethlehem and live there with Mary after the Purification. I
   think he was looking out for a house there. About three days ago some
   rather distinguished people came to the cave from Bethlehem; they
   wanted to take the Holy Family into their house. Mary hid herself from
   them in the other cave, and Joseph declined their offer. Anna is soon
   going to visit the Blessed Virgin. I saw her very busy lately, dividing
   up her herds again for the poor and for the Temple. The Holy Family,
   too, always gave away at once whatever they had. The Consecration
   festival was still celebrated every morning and evening, but on the 13
   ^th a new festival must have started. I saw various alterations being
   made in the festival in Jerusalem. I saw the windows in many houses
   being closed and curtained. I also saw a priest with a scroll in the
   cave with Joseph. They were praying together at a little table hung
   with white and red. It was as if he had wanted to see whether Joseph
   was keeping the feast, or as if he was announcing a new feast to him.
   [It seemed to her to be a feast day, but she also thought that the
   feast of the new moon must now have begun. She was uncertain about
   this.] The Crib was quiet in these last few days, without visitors.

13. END OF THE FEAST OF THE CONSECRATION OF THE TEMPLE.

   [December 14 ^th to 18 ^th: With the Sabbath the Feast of the
   Consecration of the Temple came to an end, and Joseph ceased lighting
   the little lamps. On Sunday the 16 ^th and Monday the 17 ^th people
   from the neighborhood once more came to the Crib. The unruly beggars,
   too, were heard at the entrance. This was because people were now
   returning from the festival.

   On the 17 ^th two servants came from Anna with food and other things.
   Mary is much quicker than I am in distributing things, and everything
   was soon given away. I see Joseph beginning to tidy and clear up in the
   Cave of the Nativity, the side-caves, and grave of Maraha, and he has
   brought in provisions. They are awaiting Anna's visit, and Mary is
   expecting the kings to arrive soon.

   [December 17 ^th:] Today, late in the evening, I saw the kings arrive
   in a little town of scattered houses, many of which were surrounded by
   high fences. It seemed to me that this was the first Jewish town they
   came to. Bethlehem was in a straight line from here, but they went off
   to the right, I suppose because the only road led in that direction.
   [127] As they approached this place they sang particularly loudly and
   beautifully, and were full of joy, for the star shone unusually
   brightly here. It was like moonlight and one could see quite clearly
   the shadows which it cast. The inhabitants seemed either not to see the
   star or to take no special interest in it, but they were good people
   and extremely helpful. Some of the travelers had dismounted, and the
   inhabitants helped them to water their beasts. (It made me think of
   Abraham's times, when all men were so good and helpful.) Several of the
   inhabitants, bearing branches, led the travelers through the town and
   went some of the way with them. I did not see the star always shining
   brightly before them; sometimes it was quite dim. It seemed to shine
   more brightly in places where good people lived, and when the travelers
   saw that it was very brilliant, they were greatly excited and thought
   that perhaps the Messiah might be in that place.

   [December 18 ^th:] This morning they passed by a dark, misty city
   without stopping, and soon after crossed a river flowing into the Dead
   Sea. In the last two places many of the rabble which had followed them
   stayed behind. (I had a distinct impression that someone had taken
   refuge in one of these two places in a conflict before the reign of
   Solomon. [128] ) They crossed the river this morning and now came on to
   a good road.

14. THE TRAIN OF THE KINGS. ARRIVAL IN MANATHEA.

   [December 19 ^th to 21 ^st:] This evening I saw the kings on this side
   of this river. [129] Their generosity had attracted so many followers
   that their train must have numbered 200. They were nearing the town
   which was approached by Jesus on its western side on July 31 ^st in the
   second year of His ministry, though He did not enter it. Its name
   sounded like Manathea, Metanea, Medana, or Madian. [130] It had a mixed
   population of heathens and Jews; they were evil people, and though a
   high road led through the town, they would not let the kings go
   through. They led them outside the town, on the eastern side, to a
   place enclosed by walls, where there were sheds and stables. The kings
   put up their tents here, fed and watered their beasts, and prepared a
   meal for themselves.

   On Thursday the 20 ^th and Friday the 21 ^st I saw the kings resting
   here, but they were greatly distressed because here, as in the last
   town, nobody knew or cared about the newborn King. I heard them telling
   the inhabitants in a very friendly way a great deal about the cause of
   their long journey and all the circumstances attending it. Of what I
   heard I recollect this much.

   They had received the announcement about the newborn King a very long
   time ago. I think it must have been not long after Job's time and
   before Abraham went to Egypt, when an army of some three thousand Medes
   from Job's country (they lived in other parts as well) came as far as
   the region of Heliopolis in a campaign against Egypt. [131] I cannot
   now clearly recollect why they had advanced so far, but I think their
   campaign was in aid of someone. It was not, however, for a good
   purpose, they were attacking something holy; whether holy men or a
   religious mystery connected with the fulfillment of the promise, I
   cannot remember. Near Heliopolis an angel appeared to several of their
   leaders at once, warning them to go no farther. He spoke to them of a
   Redeemer who was to be born of a Virgin and would be worshipped by
   their descendants. This was connected, I cannot remember how, with a
   command that they should advance no farther but should go home and
   observe the stars. After this I saw them arranging joyful feasts in
   Egypt, setting up triumphal arches and altars, and decorating them with
   flowers. Then they went home. They were Median star-worshippers,
   exceptionally tall, almost like giants, of very noble stature and of a
   beautiful yellowish-brown color. They journeyed with their herds from
   place to place and imposed their will everywhere by their great
   strength. I have forgotten the name of their chief prophet. They were
   much given to prophesying and the taking of omens from animals. Often
   on their journeys animals would suddenly place themselves across their
   road, standing with outstretched legs and letting themselves be killed
   rather than go away. That was an omen for them, and they turned away
   from these roads. The kings said that these Medes, returning from
   Egypt, were the first to bring the prophecy and to start the watching
   of the stars. When they passed away, it was continued by a disciple of
   Balaam and renewed 1,000 years after him by the three
   prophetess-daughters of the three kings who founded their dynasties.
   Now, 500 years after them, the star had come which they were following
   in order to adore the newborn King. All this they explained to the
   inquisitive listeners with the most child-like sincerity, and were
   distressed that they did not seem at all to believe in what their
   ancestors had so patiently waited for during 2,000 years. In the
   evening the star was covered in mist, but when it appeared again at
   night large and clear between moving clouds, they rose from their camp
   and awoke the inhabitants living near to show them the star. These
   gazed in wonder at the sky, and some showed emotion; but many of them
   were vexed with the kings, and in general they merely sought to take
   advantage of their generosity.

   I heard the kings saying what a long way they had traveled from their
   first meeting-place to here. They reckoned by day's journeys on foot,
   each of twelve hours. But their beasts, which were dromedaries and were
   faster than horses, enabled them to do thirty-six hours' journey each
   twenty-four hours, including the rest-hours. Thus the most distant of
   the three kings was able to accomplish his sixty hours' journey to the
   meeting-place in two days, and the two who were nearer did their
   thirty-six hours' journey in a day and a night. From the meeting-place
   to where they were now they had traveled 672 hours' journey, and had
   spent about twenty-five days and nights since starting off at the
   moment of the Birth of Christ.

   [December 20 ^th and 21 ^st:] The kings and their train rested here
   both these days, and I heard what they told. On the evening of Friday
   the 21 ^st the Jews who lived here began their Sabbath and crossed a
   bridge leading westwards across the water to a small Jewish village
   with a synagogue. At the same time the kings prepared for their
   departure and made their farewells. I noticed that the inhabitants
   looked at the star (when visible) which led the kings and expressed
   much astonishment, but it did not make them more respectful. They were
   shamelessly importunate, pestering the kings like swarms of wasps. In
   reply to their demands the kings with great forbearance gave them
   little triangular pieces of their gold and also grains of some darker
   metal. They must have been very rich.

   They were escorted by the inhabitants when they left. Skirting the
   wails of the town (in which I saw temples surmounted by idols), they
   crossed the river by a bridge, and passed through the Jewish village,
   hurrying on towards the Jordan by a good road. From here they still had
   about twenty-four hours' journey to Jerusalem.

15. ST. ANNE JOURNEYS TO BETHLEHEM.

   [December 19 ^th to 22 ^nd:] On the evening of December 19 ^th, I saw
   Anna, accompanied by her second husband, Mary Heli, a maid, and a
   manservant with two donkeys, stopping for the night not far from
   Bethany on their way to Bethlehem.

   Joseph has finished the arrangements which he has been making in the
   Cave of the Nativity and in the side-caves in order to receive both the
   guests from Nazareth and the kings, whose arrival Mary had foreseen a
   short while ago when they were at Causur. Joseph and Mary had moved
   with the Infant Jesus into the other cave. The Cave of the Nativity had
   been entirely cleared out, and only the donkey, I saw, had been left in
   it. Even the fireplace and the things for preparing food had been moved
   out. Joseph had, if I remember rightly, already paid his second tax.
   There were again many inquisitive visitors coming to Mary from
   Bethlehem to see the Child. Some He allowed to take Him in their arms,
   from others He turned away crying. I saw the Blessed Virgin calm and
   peaceful in the new dwelling, which had now been arranged very
   comfortably. Her couch was against the wall. The Infant Jesus lay
   beside her in a long basket woven from broad strips of bark; it had a
   shelter for the head and stood on trestles. The Blessed Virgin's couch
   with Jesus' cradle was separated from the rest of the room by a wicker
   screen. In the daytime, except when she wished to be alone, she sat in
   front of this screen with the Child beside her. Joseph's resting-place
   was some way off at the side of the cave, and was divided off in the
   same way. A vessel holding a lamp stood on a piece of wood projecting
   from the wall high enough to light both these screened-off partitions.
   I saw Joseph bringing the Blessed Virgin a bowl of food and a jug of
   water.

   [December 20 ^th:] This evening was the beginning of a fast. All the
   food for the next day was prepared beforehand, the fire was covered
   over, the openings of the cave hung with curtains, and all the
   household utensils put away. (The 8 ^th and 16 ^th days of the month
   Shebat are Jewish fast days.) Anna has come to the cave with her second
   husband, Mary's elder sister, and a maidservant. I had seen Anna on her
   journey several days before. These visitors were to sleep in the Cave
   of the Nativity; this was why the Holy Family had moved into the
   side-cave, though the donkey had remained behind. Today I saw Mary lay
   the Infant in her mother's arms; Anna was greatly moved. She had
   brought with her coverlets, clothes, and provisions. Anna's maidservant
   was strangely dressed. [Please refer to Figure 20.] Her hair was
   plaited and hung down to her girdle in a net; she had on a short dress
   reaching only to the knees. Her pointed bodice was fastened tightly
   round her hips and breast; it came high up above the latter as if to
   make a place for hiding something. She carried a basket hanging on her
   arm. The old man (Anna's husband) was very shy and humble. Anna slept
   where Elizabeth had slept, and Mary told her everything, as she had
   Elizabeth, in happy intimacy. Anna wept with the Blessed Virgin; they
   often interrupted their talk to caress the Infant Jesus.

   [December 21 ^st:] Today I saw the Blessed Virgin once more in the Cave
   of the Nativity and little Jesus once more in the crib. When Joseph and
   Mary are alone with the little Child, I often see them adoring Him; and
   now I see Anna and the Blessed Virgin standing by the Crib with bowed
   heads, and gazing at the Infant Jesus with great devotion. I am not
   quite sure whether Anna's companions slept in the other cave or whether
   they had gone away. I almost think they had gone. Today I saw that Anna
   had brought the Mother and Child various things such as coverlets and
   swaddling-bands. Since she came here, Mary has been given a good many
   things; but she has very little of anything, because she at once gives
   away anything that is not absolutely necessary. I heard her telling
   Anna that the kings out of the East would soon be coming, bringing
   great gifts, and that this would cause a great sensation. I think that
   while the kings are on their way here, Anna will go to her sister,
   three hours' distance from here, and come back later.

   [December 22 ^nd:] This evening, after the Sabbath had ended, I saw
   Anna and her companions going away from the Blessed Virgin for a little
   time. She went three hours' journey away from here, to the Tribe of
   Benjamin, to a younger married sister who lived there. I do not
   remember the name of the village, which consisted only of a few houses
   and a field. It is half an hour away from the last resting-place of the
   Holy Family on their journey to Bethlehem, where Joseph's relations
   lived. They spent the night of November 22 ^nd/23 ^rd there.

16. THE TRAIN OF THE KINGS CROSSES THE JORDON.

   The kings and their train left Mathanea and hurried through the night,
   following a high-road. They passed through no more towns, but skirted
   all the little places in which, at the end of July in the third year of
   His ministry, Jesus blessed the children and healed and taught; for
   example, Bethabara, [132] the place of the ferry across the Jordan,
   which they reached early in the morning. As it was the Sabbath, they
   met few people on their way.

   Early in the morning, at seven o'clock, I saw them crossing the Jordan.
   Generally people were ferried across the river on a raft of beams, but
   for large companies a sort of bridge was put together. This was
   generally done by the ferrymen who lived on the bank and received
   payment for it, but as these could not work on the Sabbath the
   travelers did it themselves, with the help of some of the ferrymen's
   heathen servants, who were paid for it. The Jordan was not broad here
   and was full of sand-banks. Planks were placed against the raft
   generally used for crossing, and the camels were led up them onto the
   raft. I saw that this sort of bridge was ferried backwards and forwards
   till all the train were landed on the western bank. It was quite a long
   time before all were safely across.

   [In the evening at half-past five, she said:] They have left Jericho on
   their right and are now in a direct line with Bethlehem, but are
   turning more to the right in the direction of Jerusalem. There must be
   as many as a hundred men with them. In the distance I see a little
   town, which I know, beside a stream coming from Jerusalem in an
   eastward direction. I am sure they will have to pass through this town.
   They go on for some time with the stream on their left hand. I saw
   Jerusalem as they went; it sank out of sight and reappeared as the road
   rose or fell. [Later she said:] They did not pass through that town
   after all; they turned to the right towards Jerusalem.

   Today [Saturday evening, December 22 ^nd] I saw the three holy kings
   and their train arriving before Jerusalem. I saw the city towering up
   to heaven. The guiding star had here almost disappeared; it had become
   quite small and glowed only dimly behind the city. The travelers became
   more and more depressed the nearer they came to Jerusalem, for the star
   was not nearly so bright before them, and in Judea they saw it but
   seldom. They had expected, too, to find everywhere great rejoicings and
   festivities at the newborn Savior, for whose sake they had made so long
   a journey. When, however, they found nowhere the smallest trace of
   excitement about Him, they were distressed and full of doubts, thinking
   that they had perhaps gone completely astray.

   Their train numbered, I am sure, more than 200 men, and took a quarter
   of an hour to pass by. A distinguished company had joined them as far
   back as Causur, and since then others had been added. The three kings
   rode on dromedaries (camels with two humps), with baggage all round
   them, and there were three other loaded dromedaries with their riders.
   Each king was accompanied by four men of his tribe; among them I
   noticed two young men (one of them was Azarias of Atom), whom I saw
   later as fathers of families when Jesus visited Arabia. The rest of the
   company rode mostly on very swift yellowish animals with delicate
   heads; I am not sure whether these were horses or donkeys. They looked
   quite different from our horses. The ones ridden by the more
   distinguished persons had richly ornamented saddles and bridles, and
   were hung with little gold chains and stars. Some of the company went
   up to the gate of the city and came back accompanied by guards and
   soldiers. Their arrival by this road with so large a train caused great
   surprise, as there was no festival and they were bringing no
   merchandise with them. When questioned, they explained why they had
   come, speaking of the star and the newborn child, but not a soul there
   understood what they were talking about. This depressed them extremely;
   they thought that they must certainly have made a mistake, for they
   could find nobody here who seemed to know anything about the Savior of
   the World. Everyone gazed at them in astonishment, and could not
   understand what they wanted. However, the gate-keepers went back into
   the city to report when they saw the generous alms given so kindly to
   the importunate beggars, and heard not only that the kings sought a
   lodging and would pay liberally, but also that they asked to speak with
   King Herod. Then followed an exchange of reports, messages, inquiries,
   and explanations between the kings and the authorities. While this was
   going on, the kings talked with the various people who had collected
   round them. Some of them had heard a rumor of a child said to have been
   born at Bethlehem, but it could not, they said, be He, for His parents
   were common people and poor. Others only laughed at them; and as they
   gathered, from what little the people said, that Herod knew nothing of
   a newborn child, and that, in general, they had no very high opinion of
   Herod, they became even more dejected, for they were troubled in their
   minds as to how to deal with the matter when speaking to Herod.
   However, calming themselves, they fell to praying and took courage
   again, saying to each other: He who has led us here so quickly by the
   star will bring us happily home again.

   When the gate-keepers at last came back, the kings and their train were
   taken round the outside of the city walls for some way and brought into
   it through a gate near Mount Calvary. They and their baggage-animals
   were taken to a circular enclosure not far from the fish market. It was
   surrounded by houses and stables, and there were guards at the
   entrances. The animals were taken into the stables, while the kings
   established themselves in sheds near a fountain in the center of the
   court. The baggage-animals were watered at this fountain. One side of
   this circular court was on the slope of a hill; the two other sides
   were open, with trees in front.

   Officials now came two by two with torches and examined what the kings
   had in their baggage. I suppose they were customs officers.

17. THEOKENO IS SUMMONED TO HEROD'S PALACE.

   Herod's palace was on higher ground, not far from here, and I saw the
   way there illuminated with torches and braziers on poles. Herod sent a
   servant down and caused the oldest of the kings, Theokeno, to be
   brought to his palace in secret. It was after ten o'clock at night. He
   was received in a lower room by one of Herod's courtiers and questioned
   as to the object of his journey. He related everything in the most
   childlike manner, and begged him to ask Herod where to find the newborn
   King of the Jews whose star they had seen and followed in order to
   worship Him. When the courtier reported this to Herod, he was much
   startled, but he dissembled and sent in reply a message saying that he
   would cause inquiries to be made, but that in the meantime the kings
   were to rest: early next morning he would speak with them all himself
   and tell them what he had discovered. Theokeno was thus unable to give
   his companions any special encouragement when he returned to them, and
   they made no preparations for resting, but on the contrary ordered the
   repacking of much that had been unpacked. I did not see them sleeping
   that night at all; they were wandering about separately in the city
   with guides, looking at the sky as if they were seeking for their star.
   In Jerusalem itself all was quiet, but there was much talk and coming
   and going at the guard-house before the court. The kings were of the
   opinion that Herod probably knew everything but wished to keep it
   secret from them.

   Herod was giving a feast when Theokeno was in the palace; the rooms
   were illuminated and full of guests, among them brazen-faced women in
   fine dresses. Theokeno's questions about a newborn King disturbed Herod
   greatly, and he at once summoned all the high priests and scribes. I
   saw them coming to him with their scrolls before midnight, wearing
   their priestly vestments and breast-plates and their girdles with
   letters. I saw as many as twenty of them about him. He asked them where
   Christ was to be born. I saw them unrolling their scrolls before him
   and answering, pointing with their fingers: In Bethlehem of Judah, for
   so it is written by the prophet Micah: "And you Bethlehem in the land
   of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah; for out of you
   shall come forth the captain that shall rule my people Israel."' Then I
   saw Herod walking about on the roof of the palace with some of them and
   looking in vain for the star of which Theokeno had spoken. He was in a
   strange state of unrest, but the learned priests made every effort to
   persuade him not to pay any attention to what the kings had said. These
   romantic people, they said, were always full of fantastic ideas about
   their stars; if such a thing had really happened, Herod and they
   themselves, in the Temple in the Holy City, would of course be the
   first to know of it.

18. THE THREE HOLY KINGS APPEAR BEFORE HEROD.

   [Sunday, December 23 ^rd:] Very early this morning Herod secretly
   summoned the three kings to his palace. [133] They were received under
   an archway and taken into a room, where I saw green branches and bushes
   arranged in vases to welcome them, with some refreshments. They
   remained standing for a while until Herod came in, and then, after
   bowing before him, they again asked him about the newborn King of the
   Jews. Herod concealed his uneasiness as well as he could and even
   pretended to be overjoyed. He still had some of the scribes with him.
   He inquired of the kings as to what they had seen, and Mensor described
   to him the last picture they had seen in the stars before setting off
   on their journey. This, he said, was a Virgin with a Child before her:
   on the right-hand side of the picture a branch of light grew forth,
   bearing on it a tower with several gates. This tower had grown into a
   great city, over which the Child had appeared as a king with crown,
   sword, and scepter. They had then seen themselves and the kings of the
   whole world come and bow down before the Child in adoration, for His
   kingdom was to conquer all other kingdoms. Herod told them that a
   prophecy of this kind about Bethlehem Ephrata did indeed exist and
   asked them to go there at once very quietly, and when they had found
   and adored the Child, to come back and bring him word, that he, too,
   might go and adore Him. The kings, who had not touched any of the food
   set out for them by Herod, went back again. It was very early, for I
   saw the torches in front of the palace still alight. Herod spoke to
   them in secret because of all the talk in the city. The day then began
   to break, and they made all preparations for their departure. The
   stragglers who had followed them to Jerusalem had dispersed about the
   city the night before.

19. HEROD'S STATE OF MIND - A MURDER.

   Herod was in a state of ill-humor and vexation in these days. At the
   time of Christ's birth he had been in his palace near Jericho and had
   committed a vile murder. He had insinuated adherents of his into the
   higher posts of the Temple to find out what was going on there so as to
   warn him of anyone opposed to his designs. One of these in particular
   was a high official in the Temple, a good and upright man. He invited
   this man with friendly words to visit him at Jericho, but caused him to
   be waylaid and murdered in the desert on his way there, making it
   appear as the work of robbers. A few days later he came to Jerusalem in
   order to take part in the feast of the dedication of the Temple on the
   25 ^th day of the month Kislev, and there he became involved in a very
   disagreeable affair. He wanted to do something in his own way which
   would please the Jews and do them honor. He had a golden image made of
   a lamb, or rather of a kid, for it had horns. This was to be set up for
   the festival over the gate leading from the outer court of the women
   into the Court of Sacrifice. He proposed to force this arrangement on
   the Jews and yet expected to be thanked for it. The priests opposed it,
   so he threatened them with fines, whereupon they declared that they
   would pay the fine, but that their law forbade them ever to accept the
   image. Herod, bitterly angered, tried to put up the image in secret;
   but when it was brought into the Temple, it was seized by a zealous
   official and flung to the ground, so that it broke in two. [134] A
   tumult ensued, and Herod had the official imprisoned. This affair had
   so angered him that he regretted coming to the feast. His courtiers
   endeavored to distract him with all kinds of entertainments.

   Now came the rumors of Christ's birth to add to Herod's uneasiness. Of
   late there had arisen among certain devout Jews a lively sense of the
   near approach of the Messiah. The events attending the birth of Jesus
   had been spread abroad by the shepherds, but all this was looked on by
   important people as nonsensical gossip. It had come to Herod's ears,
   and he had secretly made inquiries at Bethlehem. His messengers came to
   the Crib three days after Christ's birth [see above, p. 102 ], and
   after talking with St. Joseph, a poor man, they reported, as all
   arrogant people like them are wont to do, that there was nothing to be
   seen but a poor family in a miserable cave, and that the whole thing
   was not worth talking about. To begin with, they were too arrogant to
   talk properly to St. Joseph, all the more as they had been warned not
   to cause any sensation. Now, however, Herod was suddenly confronted by
   the three kings and their numerous company, and was filled with fear
   and dismay, for they came from a long way off and their story could not
   be dismissed as idle talk. When however they inquired so particularly
   about the newborn King, he feigned a desire to worship Him too, much to
   their joy. He was in no way reassured by the blind arrogance of the
   scribes, and was determined in his own interests that the event should
   remain as unnoticed as possible. He did not at once oppose the
   statements made to him by the kings, nor did he at once lay hands on
   Jesus, for by so doing he feared to give the impression to the people
   (who were already in a difficult frame of mind) that the kings'
   announcement was true and of serious consequence to himself. He
   therefore planned to gain more accurate information from the kings
   before taking steps himself about it. When the kings, warned by God,
   failed to return to him, he announced that their flight was a proof
   that they had either been disappointed in their search or had been
   lying. He caused it to be spread abroad that they had been ashamed and
   afraid to come back, because they had so greatly deceived themselves
   and others; what other reason could there be for their secret flight,
   when they had been received by him in so friendly a manner? In this way
   he stopped all further rumors and merely let it be known in Bethlehem
   that no one should have anything to do with that family and that no
   attention should be paid to misleading rumors and imaginations. When
   the Holy Family returned to Nazareth a fortnight later, it put an end
   to the talk about an event which had never become clearly known to most
   people. The devout ones hoped in silence. When all was calm once more,
   Herod planned to do away with Jesus, but heard that the family with the
   Child had now left Nazareth. For a long time he caused search to be
   made for the Child, and when he was forced to give up hope of finding
   Him, his anxiety increased, and he had recourse to the desperate
   measure of the Massacre of the Innocents. He took stringent precautions
   and ordered a number of troop movements in order to prevent any
   insurrection. I think the children were murdered in seven different
   places.

20. THE HOLY THREE KINGS GO TO BETHLEHEM. THEY REST BY A SPRING.

   I saw the kings and their train moving southwards out of the city gate.
   A crowd of people followed them as far as a brook outside the walls,
   and then, turned back. After crossing the stream, the kings made a
   short halt to look for their star. When they saw it they broke into
   cries of joy, and went on their journey, singing their sweet songs. The
   star did not lead them by the direct road to Bethlehem, but by a
   westerly detour. They passed by a little town I know well, and towards
   midday I saw them stop in a pleasant place near a little village behind
   the town. A spring of water burst forth before their eyes, at which
   they were overjoyed. They dismounted and hollowed out a basin round the
   spring, surrounding it with clean sand, stones, and turf. They stayed
   several hours here, watering and feeding their beasts, and refreshing
   themselves with food; for in Jerusalem they had been too disturbed and
   anxious to rest. In later years I saw Our Lord stopping sometimes by
   this spring with His disciples and teaching there.

   The star, which at night shone like a ball of fire, now looked like the
   moon in daylight. It was not a perfect round, but had as it were a
   jagged edge; I often saw it hidden by clouds.

   The direct road from Jerusalem to Bethlehem was full of travelers with
   donkeys and baggage, probably returning home from Bethlehem after the
   taxation, or going to the market or the Temple in Jerusalem. The way
   taken by the kings was very quiet, and no doubt God led them by it so
   that they should not cause too much sensation and should not arrive in
   Bethlehem before the evening. When the sun was already low, I saw them
   starting off again. They traveled in the same order as when they first
   met. Mensor, the brownish one and the youngest, went first; then came
   Seir, the dark-brown one; and then Theokeno, the white-skinned one and
   the eldest.

21. ARRIVAL OF THE THREE KINGS AT THE TAX-COLLECTION HOUSE IN BETHLEHEM.

   Today, Sunday, December 23 ^rd, at dusk, I saw the three holy kings and
   their train arrive at the same building outside Bethlehem where Joseph
   and Mary had been registered. It was the former ancestral house of
   David of which some masonry still remained; once it had belonged to
   Joseph's parents. It was a large house with several smaller ones round
   it; in front of it was a closed court, giving on to an open place with
   trees and a fountain. In this place I saw Roman soldiers; they were
   there because of the tax office which was in the building. When the
   kings and their train arrived, a crowd of inquisitive onlookers began
   pressing round them. The star had disappeared, and they were somewhat
   uneasy. Some men came up to them and questioned them. They dismounted,
   and were met by officials from the house bearing branches, who offered
   them a light refreshment of bread, fruit, and drink. This was a usual
   welcome for strangers like these. Meanwhile I saw their beasts being
   watered at the fountain under the trees. I thought to myself: these
   strangers are more courteously received than poor Joseph, because of
   the little gold pieces they distribute. They were told that the
   Shepherds' Valley was a good camping-place, but remained for some time
   undecided. I did not hear them ask for the newborn King of the Jews;
   they knew that according to the prophecy this was the place, but
   because of what Herod had said to them they were afraid of causing any
   comment. When, however, they saw a light shining in the sky beside
   Bethlehem, as though the moon were rising, they mounted again and rode
   beside a ditch and some ruined walls round the south side of Bethlehem
   towards the east, approaching the Cave of the Nativity from the field
   where the angels had appeared to the shepherds. On entering the valley
   behind the cave, near the grave of Maraha, they dismounted, and their
   people unpacked much of the luggage and set up a great tent which they
   had with them. They made all arrangements for an encampment with the
   help of some shepherds, who had pointed out the places to them.

   The camp had been partly arranged when the kings saw the star appear
   bright and clear above the hill where the Cave of the Nativity was, the
   light that streamed from it descending in a vertical line onto the
   hill. [135] The star seemed to grow larger as it drew near until it
   became a body of light which looked to me as big as a sheet. I saw them
   at first gazing at it in great astonishment. It was already dark; they
   saw no house, only the outline of a hill, like a rampart. Suddenly they
   were filled with great joy, for they saw in the radiance the shining
   figure of a Child, like the one they had seen before in the star. All
   bared their heads in obeisance, and the three kings, going up to the
   hill, found the door of the cave. Mensor opened the door and saw the
   cave full of heavenly light, and, in the back of it, the Virgin sitting
   with the Child, just as they had seen them in their visions. He went
   back at once and told this to his companions; in the meantime Joseph,
   accompanied by an aged shepherd, came out of the cave to meet them.
   They told him, in childlike simplicity, how they had come to adore the
   newborn King of the Jews, whose star they had seen, and to bring Him
   gifts. Joseph welcomed them warmly, and the old shepherd accompanied
   them to their encampment and helped them with their arrangements; some
   of the shepherds who were there gave them the use of some sheds. They
   themselves prepared for the solemn ceremony that was before them. I saw
   them putting on big white cloaks with long trains. The material had a
   yellowish sheen, like raw silk, and was beautifully fine and light.
   They wore these fluttering robes for all their religious ceremonies.
   All three wore girdles on which many pouches and gold boxes (like
   sugar-basins with knobs) were suspended by little chains among the
   ample folds of their cloaks. Each of the kings was followed by four
   members of his family. Besides these there Were several of Mensor's
   servants holding a small tablet like a tray, a rug with tassels, and
   some strips of thin stuff.

   They followed St. Joseph in an ordered procession to the shelter at the
   entrance of the cave, where they covered the tray with the tasseled
   rug. Each king then placed on it some of the golden boxes and vessels
   which he took from his girdle; this was the offering which they made in
   common. Mensor and all the others took their sandals from off their
   feet, while Joseph opened the door of the cave. Two youths from
   Mensor's following went before him, spreading out a strip of stuff on
   the floor of the cave before his feet and then retiring. Two others
   came close behind him with the tray of presents, which he took from
   them when he was before the Blessed Virgin, and falling on his knee
   placed them at her feet on a low stand. Those who had carried the tray
   went back. Behind Mensor stood the four members of his family, humbly
   bowing down. Seir and Theokeno with their followers stood at the
   entrance and under the shelter outside. They were all as though drunk
   with ecstasy and seemed transfused by the light which filled the cave,
   though no light was there save the Light of the World.

   Mary was lying, rather than sitting, on a carpet to the left of the
   Infant Jesus; she was leaning on her arm. The Child lay in a trough
   covered with a rug and raised on a high stand, opposite the entrance to
   the cave and at the place where He was born. As the kings entered, the
   Blessed Virgin raised herself into a sitting position, covered herself
   with a veil, and took the Infant Jesus onto her lap under her ample
   veil. When Mensor knelt down and spoke touching words of homage as he
   put down his presents, humbly bowing his bared head and crossing his
   hands on his breast, Mary undid the red-and-white wrappings from the
   upper part of the Child's body, which gleamed softly from behind her
   veil. She supported His head with one hand and held Him with the other.
   He was holding His little hands before His breast as if in prayer. He
   was shining with welcome, and now and then made friendly little
   gestures with His hands.

   O what heavenly peace surrounds the prayers of these good men from the
   East! As I saw them, I said to myself: how clear and untroubled are
   their hearts, as full of goodness and innocence as the hearts of pious
   children. There is nothing violent in them, and yet they are all fire
   and love. I am dead; I am a spirit; otherwise, I could not see it, for
   it is not happening now--and yet it is now, for it is not in time; in
   God is no time, in God everything is present. I am dead. I am a spirit.
   As these strange thoughts came to me, I heard myself being told: What
   is that to you? Be not troubled, look, and praise the Lord who is
   eternal and in whom are all things.'

   I now saw Mensor bringing out of a pouch hanging at his girdle a
   handful of little thick shining bars. They were as long as one's
   finger, pointed at the top, and speckled with little gold-colored
   grains in the middle. He offered these to the Blessed Virgin as his
   gift, laying them humbly on her knee beside the Child. She accepted the
   gold with loving gratitude, and covered it with a corner of her cloak.
   These little bars of natural gold were Mensor's gift, because he was
   full of fidelity and love and was seeking for the holy truth with
   unshaken fervor and devotion. He then withdrew with his four
   companions, and Seir, the dark-brown one, came forward with his
   following and, falling with great humility on both knees, offered his
   present with touching words of homage. This was a little golden
   incense-boat full of little greenish grains of gum, which he laid on
   the table before the Infant Jesus. Incense was his gift because he
   embraced the will of God, and followed it willingly, reverently, and
   lovingly. He knelt there for a long time with deep devotion before
   withdrawing. After him, came Theokeno, the white-skinned one, and the
   oldest. He was very old and heavy and was not able to kneel down; but
   he stood bowing low and placed on the table a golden vessel containing
   a delicate green plant. It seemed to be rooted; it was a tiny green
   upright tree, very delicate, bearing curly foliage with little delicate
   white flowers. It was myrrh. His gift was myrrh, because it symbolizes
   mortification and the overcoming of passions; for this good man had
   conquered extreme temptations to commit idolatry, polygamy, and to give
   way to violence. He remained standing in deep emotion before the Infant
   Jesus with his attendants for a very long time, and I grew sorry for
   the other servants before the Crib having to wait so long to see the
   Child. The addresses made by the kings and their followers were
   extremely touching and childlike. As they knelt down and offered their
   presents, they said: We have seen His star, we have seen that He is
   king over all kings, and we come to worship Him and to pay Him homage
   with our gifts'--or something like this. They seemed to be in an
   ecstasy, and with childlike and rapturous prayers committed to the
   Infant Jesus themselves and their families, their lands and their
   peoples, all their goods and possessions and everything of value that
   they owned. They besought the newborn King to accept their hearts and
   souls and all their thoughts and deeds, begging Him to enlighten them
   and to grant them every virtue and, while they were on earth,
   happiness, peace, and love. While thus praying, they were overflowing
   with loving humility; and tears of joy coursed down their cheeks and
   beards. They were blissfully happy; they thought that they had now
   reached the very star for which their ancestors had watched for
   centuries with faithful yearning. All the joy of promises fulfilled
   after many centuries was theirs.

   The Mother of God accepted all these gifts with humble gratitude. At
   first she said nothing, but a gentle movement under her veil showed the
   joy and emotion that she felt. The Child's bare body, which she had
   wrapped in her veil, seemed to shine from under her cloak. Afterwards
   she spoke a few, friendly, humble words of gratitude to each king,
   throwing her veil back a little as she did so. Ah, I said to myself, I
   have been given another lesson. With what sweet and loving gratitude
   she accepts each gift--she, who needs naught, who possesses Jesus
   Himself, accepts with humility every loving gift. From this I can
   surely learn how loving gifts should be received; I, too, in future
   will accept every kindness with thankfulness and all humility. How kind
   Mary and Joseph are; they kept nothing at all for themselves, but gave
   it all away to the poor.

   When the kings with their attendants had left the cave and gone to
   their encampment, their servants came in. They had put up the tent,
   unloaded the baggage animals, and, after arranging everything, were
   waiting in patient humility before the entrance. There must have been
   at least thirty of them, as well as a host of boys who had nothing on
   but loin-cloths and little cloaks. The servants always came in fives,
   led by one of the important personages to whom they belonged. They
   knelt round the Child and venerated Him in silence. Afterwards the boys
   came in all together, knelt round and worshipped the Infant Jesus with
   childlike innocence and joy. The servants did not stay long in the
   cave, for the kings came back again, making a solemn entry this time.
   They had put on other cloaks of thin stuff which floated round them in
   ample folds; they carried censers in their hands and censed with great
   reverence the Child and the Blessed Virgin and St. Joseph and the whole
   cave, withdrawing afterwards with low obeisances. This was a customary
   form of worship amongst these people.

   During all this Mary and Joseph were as full of sweet joy as I ever saw
   them; tears of happiness often ran down their cheeks. The recognition
   and solemn veneration of the Infant Jesus, whom they had been obliged
   to lodge so poorly, and whose infinite glory was a secret hidden in
   their humble hearts, brought them endless consolation. By God's
   almighty Providence, they saw the Child of the Promise being given, in
   spite of the blindness of mankind, what they themselves could not give
   him: the worship of the great ones of the earth with all the sacred
   splendor due to Him, prepared since centuries and sent from a far
   country. They worshipped Jesus with the holy kings, happy in the honor
   paid to Him.

   The kings' encampment was set up in the valley behind the cave,
   stretching as far as the tomb of Maraha. The beasts of burden were
   fastened in rows to posts between ropes. Beside the big tent, which was
   near the hill of the Cave of the Nativity, was an enclosure roofed with
   mats where part of the baggage was stored, though most of it was taken
   into Maraha's tomb. The stars had come out when all had left the Crib,
   and they all assembled in a circle near the old terebinth tree which
   stood above Maraha's tomb and there, with solemn hymns, held their
   service to the stars. I cannot express how movingly their singing
   echoed through the quiet valley. For so many centuries their forebears
   had gazed at the stars, prayed, and sung; and today all their yearning
   was fulfilled. They sang in raptures of gratitude and joy.

22. JOSEPH ENTERTAINS THE THREE HOLY KINGS.

   Meanwhile Joseph, helped by two of the old shepherds, had set out a
   light meal in the kings' tent. They brought plates with bread, fruit,
   honey-comb, bowls with vegetables, and flasks of balsam, arranging it
   all on a low table on a carpet. Joseph had got together all these
   provisions for the kings in the morning, having been forewarned of
   their arrival by the Blessed Virgin. When the kings and the members of
   their families returned to the tent after their evening hymn, I saw
   Joseph receiving them with great friendliness and begging them to be
   his guests and accept this modest meal. He reclined among them round
   the low table as they ate. He was not at all shy, and was so happy that
   he shed tears of joy. (When I saw this, I thought of how my dead
   father, who was a poor peasant, was obliged to sit at table with so
   many grand people when I was clothed at the convent. He was very humble
   and simple and had dreaded this sorely, but afterwards he was so happy
   that he wept for joy. Without wanting it he became the guest

   of honor.) After this slight meal Joseph left them. Some of the more
   important persons accompanying the kings betook themselves to an inn at
   Bethlehem, the others lay down to rest on their couches spread out in a
   circle in the big tent.

   When Joseph returned to the Crib, he put all the presents in a corner
   of the wall to the right of the Crib, placing a screen before it so
   that what was kept there could not be seen. Anna's maidservant, who had
   remained behind to wait on the Blessed Virgin, had stayed all this time
   in the small side-cave, of which the door was in the entrance to the
   Cave of the Nativity. She did not come out until all had left the Crib.
   She was very serious and modest. I never saw either the Holy Family or
   this maidservant showing any worldly pleasure at the sight of the
   kings' gifts. Everything was accepted with humble gratitude, and given
   away again with gentle charity.

   When the kings had arrived that evening at the tax-collecting office in
   Bethlehem, I had seen a certain amount of disturbance there and much
   movement in the town. Some people followed the kings to the Valley of
   the Shepherds, but soon came back again. Afterwards, while the kings,
   radiant with holy joy, were worshipping and offering their gifts at the
   Crib, I saw some Jews lurking at a distance in the country round and
   murmuring angrily, and then going about in Bethlehem spreading all
   kinds of rumors. These miserable men made me shed bitter tears; I was
   grieved at heart for the evil people who, nowadays as in those distant
   times, stand about muttering and grumbling and spreading lies in their
   wrath; salvation is so close to them, and they thrust it from them. How
   unlike they are to the good kings who, in their trusting faith in the
   Promise, have come from so far and have found salvation. How I pity the
   hard-hearted and blind!

   In Jerusalem during this day I saw Herod again with several scribes.
   They were reading from scrolls and talking of the statement made by the
   kings. Afterwards it was no more spoken of, as though the whole matter
   were to be ignored.

23. THE KINGS VISIT WITH THE HOLY FAMILY AGAIN. THEIR GENEROSITY TO THE
SHEPHERDS.

   [December 24 ^th:] Very early today I saw the kings and some of their
   followers pay separate visits to the Infant Jesus and the Blessed
   Virgin. During the whole day I saw them busy in their camp beside their
   beasts of burden distributing all kinds of things. They were full of
   joy and happiness, and gave away many gifts, as I have always seen done
   on joyful occasions. The shepherds who had rendered services to the
   kings and their train were given many presents, and I saw many poor
   people receiving gifts. I saw them hanging coverlets over the shoulders
   of some poor old women who crept up to them all bent. Several of the
   kings' followers took a great liking to the Shepherds' Valley, wishing
   to stay there and join the shepherds. They submitted this wish to the
   kings, who allowed them to leave their service and gave them rich
   presents. They were given blankets, household utensils, grains of gold,
   and also the donkeys on which they had ridden. When I saw the kings
   distributing a quantity of bread, I at first wondered where so much
   bread came from. Then I remembered having seen that sometimes, when
   they halted, they used their provision of flour to bake little thin
   flat loaves like rusks in iron moulds, which they carried with them.
   These loaves they packed tightly in light leather boxes, which they
   hung on their pack animals. Today many people came from Bethlehem and
   pestered the kings for gifts of all kinds. Some of these searched their
   baggage, and on various pretexts made greedy demands of them. Here, and
   in Jerusalem too, the sensation caused by their numerous following had
   been a great annoyance to the kings. They had arrived in a kind of
   triumphal procession, thinking to find general rejoicings over the
   newborn King, but after what had happened they now resolved to start
   their return journey quietly and with a smaller following, which would
   enable them to travel more rapidly. They therefore dismissed today many
   of their followers; some of whom remained behind in the Valley of the
   Shepherds, while others went on ahead to meeting-places arranged
   beforehand. I was surprised to see how much their train had diminished
   by the evening. The kings no doubt intended to travel the next day to
   Jerusalem and to tell Herod that they had found the Child; but they
   wanted to do this more quietly, and this was why they sent many on
   ahead, thus making the journey easier. They and their dromedaries could
   overtake them without difficulty.

   In the evening they went to the Crib to say farewell. Mensor went in
   first, alone. Mary placed the Infant Jesus in his arms; he shed tears
   and his face was shining with joy. After him the two others came and
   wept as they said farewell. They brought vet more gifts, many pieces of
   different stuffs, some looking like undyed silk, some red and some with
   flowered patterns, and a number of beautiful thin coverlets; they also
   left behind their ample, thin cloaks. These were pale yellow and seemed
   to be woven of the finest wool; they were so light that they moved with
   every breath of air. They also brought many bowls standing one on the
   other, and boxes filled with grains, and a basket with pots of little
   delicate green bushes with small white flowers. There were three of
   these in the center of each pot, so arranged that another pot could be
   placed on the edge; the pots were built up above each other in the
   basket. This was myrrh. They also gave Joseph long narrow baskets
   containing birds; they had had a number of these hanging on their
   dromedaries for killing and eating.

   They all shed many tears when they left the Child and Mary. I saw the
   Blessed Virgin standing up beside them as they said farewell. She held
   the Infant Jesus in her arms wrapped in her veil, and went a few steps
   with the kings towards the (hoar of the cave. There she stood still,
   and in order to give these holy men a remembrance, she took from her
   head the thin yellow veil covering the Infant Jesus and herself and
   handed it to Mensor. The kings received this gift with deep obeisances,
   and their hearts overflowed with awe and gratitude when they saw the
   Blessed Virgin standing before them unveiled with the Infant Jesus.
   They were weeping with joy as they left the cave. Henceforth the veil
   was the holiest treasure that they possessed.

   The manner in which the Blessed Virgin accepted presents, although it
   did not show pleasure in the things themselves,

   was particularly touching in its humility and in its real gratitude
   towards the giver. During this wonderful visit I saw in her no trace of
   self-interest, except that to begin with, out of love for the Infant
   Jesus and out of pity for Joseph, she allowed herself in all simplicity
   the joy of hoping that now they might perhaps find a shelter in
   Bethlehem and not be so contemptuously treated as on their arrival. She
   had been truly sorry for Joseph's distress and confusion at this.

   After the kings had said farewell it grew dark, and the lamp was lit in
   the cave. The kings went with their followers to the great old
   terebinth tree above Maraha's grave, there to hold their evening
   service as they had the day before. A lamp was burning beneath the
   tree. When they saw the stars coming out, they prayed and sang their
   sweet songs. The voices of the boys sounded particularly lovely among
   the others. After this they went into their tent, where Joseph had once
   more prepared a light meal for them; and then some returned to the inn
   in Bethlehem, while the rest lay down in the tent.

24. DEPARTURE OF THE KINGS.

   At midnight I suddenly saw a vision. I saw the kings lying asleep in
   their tent on rugs, and I saw the appearance of a shining youth among
   them. It was an angel. Their lamp was burning, and I saw them sitting
   up, half asleep. The angel woke them and told them to leave
   immediately, and not to go by Jerusalem but through the desert round
   the Dead Sea. They sprang in haste from their couches; some hurried to
   rouse their followers one went to the cave and woke St. Joseph, who
   hastened to Bethlehem to summon those who were in the inn. These,
   however, met him on his way there, for they had had the same vision.
   The tent was taken down, packed, and the rest of the encampment
   removed, all with wonderful speed. While the kings were taking once
   more a touching farewell of Joseph before the Crib, their followers
   were already hurrying southwards through the desert of Engaddi along
   the shores (If the Dead Sea. They traveled in separate parties so as to
   progress more quickly.

   The kings begged that the Holy Family should fly with them, for danger
   most certainly threatened them, or at least that Mary should hide
   herself with the Child so as not to be molested because of them. They
   cried like children, embracing Joseph and speaking in the most moving
   manner. Then they mounted their dromedaries, which carried but little
   baggage, and hastened away across the desert. I saw the angel with them
   out in the fields, showing them their way; they seemed to be gone in an
   instant. They took different ways, about a quarter of an hour's
   distance apart from each other. First they went for an hour towards the
   east, and then southwards into the desert. Their way home led through
   the region which Jesus traversed on His return from Egypt in the third
   year of His ministry.

   [114] The names of the three kings as given by AC, Mensor, Seir, and
   Theokeno, find no documentary parallel, nor is there anywhere any
   information about their homelands or their subsequent history (infra,
   p. 114 ). The apocryphal Protev. 21 adds nothing to St. Matthew's
   account. For latter names, see n. 120, p. 111 . (SB)

   [116] No such visit of Our Lord to the abode of the three kings in
   Arabia is recorded in the Gospels. (SB)

   [117] She saw the procession of the kings passing through this town on
   the feast of St. Saturninus (Nov. 27th) of whom she possesses a relic;
   that is why she mentioned his connection with this place. The writer
   read later in the legend of this saint in Fleurs des Vies Saintes that
   Saturninus preached the Gospel in Asia as far as Media. (CB)

   [118] There is no available evidence about the martyr Eleazar. (SB)

   [119] According to the Ramsgate Book of Saints (1947), the names
   Melchior, Kaspar, and Balthasar were attributed to the Magi in the
   eighth century. The names themselves are not known before this,
   although Balthasar appears as a by-form of Belshazzar ( Dan. 5.1),
   which is a pagan Babylonian name Bel-shar-usur (Bel protect the king'),
   and Melchior, if a Hebrew name Malki-or, could mean My king is light'.
   The meanings given by AC are most obscure. The Legenda Aurea (Jan. 6th)
   gives their names as Appellius, Amerius, and Damascus in Greek;
   Galgalat, Malgalat, and Sarathin in Hebrew; and Melchior, Kaspar, and
   Balthasar in Latin; and adds that their bodies were found by Helena and
   taken to Constantinople, whence later to Milan, and finally to Cologne.
   (SB)

   [120] In 1839, eighteen years after this word Acajaja was pronounced by
   Catherine Emmerich, the writer found in Funke's dictionary:
   "Achajacula, a castle on an island in the Euphrates in Mesopotamia
   (Ammian, 24, 2)" (CB) The reference is to the history by Ammianus
   Marcellinus covering the twenty-six years from Constantius to Valens,
   entitled Res Gestae, in thirty-one books of which eighteen are extant.
   The twenty-fourth book deals with the campaigns of the Emperor Julian
   (A.D. 363), and in XXIV, ii, 2, the place Achaiachala, an island
   fortress in the river Euphrates, is mentioned. (SB)

   [121] The name Partherme is otherwise unknown. It occurs again (of the
   same land), infra, p. 173 . (SB)

   [122] It would seem that Mensor, the Chaldean, was from Mesopotamia,
   Theokeno from Media (Persia), and Seir from the mountain country
   between Mesopotamia and Persia. But the geographical information is not
   precise enough to determine anything. (SB)

   [123] Perhaps Geshur in Syria', Absalom's retreat in 2 Kings ( Sam.)
   15.8. Fahsel notes Geshur, a Roman garrison town on the road from
   Damascus to Galilee, just south of Mount Hermon. (SB)

   [124] The Bible tells us nothing whatever about the historical setting
   of the Book of Job, except that Job lived in the land of Hus (or
   Uz)'--a place otherwise unknown. But see further in n. 173, p. 154 .
   (SB)

   [125] That Balaam should come from a northern land is no surprise in
   view of Num. 22.5 in the Hebrew text, where we read that the king of
   Moab "sent messengers to Balaam, son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by
   the river of his people's land", and this Pethor is usually identified
   with Pitru of the Assyrian inscriptions, a city on the Euphrates (cf.
   Cath. Comm., 206d). (The Vulgate reads soothsayer' for Pethor, and
   Ammon' for his people'.) Balaam's remote and pagan origin makes him a
   character of particular interest in the history of Israel. (SB)

   [126] Maccabean Dedication Feast; cf. supra , n. 53, p. 37 . (SB)

   [127] Medeba is about eighteen miles north of the brook Arnon, which
   flows into the Dead Sea, and Bethlehem lies due west from here across
   the Dead Sea, so that travelers would have to turn north to go round
   it. (SB)

   [128] Medeba was the scene of David's battle with the Ammonites ( 1
   Chr. 19.7), and also (but after Solomon's time) one of the cities
   captured during the revolt of Mesha, King of Moab (IV Kings 3.4 sqq.,
   Isa. 15.2). as recorded on the Moabite Stone. (SB)

   [129] Since the Arnon flows east to west, we should understand northern
   side' here. (SB)

   [130] St. Jerome mentions a Methane near Arnon, which gave its name to
   the Mathanites. See 1 Chr. 11.43. (CB) Nothing else is recorded in the
   Bible about the Mathanites. Fahsel marks a village Madian on the north
   bank of the Arnon. (SB)

   [131] According to AC (infra, p. 120 ) this took place about 1500 B.C.,
   when Medes (?) from Job's country' (the Caucasus according to AC)
   invaded Egypt. Is this to be identified with the Hittite invasions in
   the Amarna period (14th cent. B.C.)? (SB)

   [132] Bethabara (thus named by AC) (= place of crossing') by the lord
   an is mentioned in some codices of John 1.28 (where John was
   baptizing'), while other codices have Bethania (= place of the
   ship')--probably two names for the same place. (SB)

   [133] That the second visit of the Magi to Herod was in private is
   recorded in Matt. 2.7. (SB)

   [134] This is probably the same story as that recorded by Josephus
   (BJ., I, xxxiii, 2-4): Herod had put up a golden eagle over the main
   gate of the Temple. Some young Jews climbed up at noonday and smashed
   it with axes. About forty men were arrested. (SB)

      XIV. THE HOLY FAMILY IN BETHLEHEM AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE KINGS.

1. MEASURES TAKEN IN BETHLEHEM AGAINST THE KINGS. JOSEPH IS EXAMINED AND
BLACKMAILED.

   [December 25 ^th:] The angel had warned the kings just in time, for the
   authorities in Bethlehem--perhaps on a Secret order from Herod, but I
   think from their own zeal of office--meant to arrest today the kings
   who were sleeping in the inn at Bethlehem and to imprison them in the
   cellars deep under the synagogue. They were then going to denounce them
   to Herod as disturbers of the peace. However, when their departure
   became known this morning, they were already near Engaddi, and the
   valley where they had encamped was quiet and deserted as usual, with
   nothing but the trodden grass and a few tent-poles to show that they
   had been there. In the meantime the appearance in Bethlehem of the
   kings and their train had caused a considerable stir. Some regretted
   that they had refused Joseph a lodging; others said that the kings were
   strange fanatical adventurers; while others connected their arrival
   with the rumors of what the shepherds had seen. The authorities of the
   place (perhaps as the result of a warning from Herod, but of this I am
   not sure) decided that steps must be taken to deal with the situation.
   In the center of the town, in an open place with a fountain surrounded
   by trees, I saw near the synagogue a large house with steps leading up
   to it. All the inhabitants were summoned to the square in front of the
   house, and I saw a warning or command being given to them from the
   steps. They were told that all perverse talk and superstitious rumors
   must be stopped, and from now onwards there must be no more running
   backwards and forwards outside the town to the dwelling of the people
   who had been the cause of all this talk. After the assembled people had
   dispersed, I saw St. Joseph summoned by two men and being examined in
   that house by some aged Jews. I saw him go back to the Crib and then
   again go to the court-house. When he went there the second time, he
   took with him some of the gold from the kings' gifts and gave it to
   them, upon which they let him go in peace. It seemed to me that the
   whole examination was a sort of blackmail. I saw, too, that a path
   leading towards the Crib was blocked by the authorities by felling a
   tree across it. This was not the path through the town-gate, but the
   one which led over a hill or rampart to the Cave of the Nativity from
   the place where Mary had waited under a big tree on arriving at
   Bethlehem. They even put up a guard-house by the tree, and stretched
   ropes across the road which were attached to a bell in the guard-house,
   so that they could hold up anyone who tried to pass. In the afternoon I
   saw a band of sixteen of Herod's soldiers talking to Joseph; they were
   probably sent on account of the kings, who had been accused of being
   disturbers of the peace. Finding, however, everything quiet and lonely,
   with nobody but a poor family in the cave, and having been warned not
   to alarm these in any way, they went quietly back to report what they
   had found. The presents and other things left by the kings had been
   hidden away by Joseph partly in Maraha's grave and partly' in some
   secret places in the hill of the Cave of the Nativity, which he knew of
   since his boyhood when he had often hidden there from his brothers.
   These separate hiding-places dated from the time of the patriarch
   Jacob, who had once set up his tents here on this hill. At that time
   there were only a few tents on the site of Bethlehem.

   This evening I saw Zechariah of Hebron coming to see the Holy Family
   for the first time. Mary was still in the cave. He wept with joy, took
   the Infant Jesus in his arms, and repeated (in part or somewhat
   altered) the hymn of praise which he had uttered at the circumcision of
   John.

2. ST. ANNE RETURNS WITH ELIUD.

   [December 26 ^th:] Today Zechariah went away again, but Anna came back
   to visit the Holy Family with her eldest daughter, her second husband
   and the maidservant. Anna's eldest daughter is bigger than her mother
   and really looks older than Anna. Anna's second husband is taller and
   older than Joachim was. His name is Eliud, and he had a post at the
   Temple connected with the supervision of the sacrificial animals. Anna
   had a daughter by him, also called Mary. At Christ's birth she must
   have been six or eight years old. This Eliud died soon after this, and
   it was God's will that Anna should marry for the third time. Of this
   marriage there was a son, who was called one of Christ's brethren.

   The maidservant brought by Anna from Nazareth a week ago is still with
   the Blessed Virgin. While the Blessed Virgin was living in the Cave of
   the Nativity, this maidservant lived in the little cave at the side;
   but now, as Mary is in the cave at the side, the maidservant sleeps
   under a shelter put up for her by Joseph in front of the cave. Anna and
   her companions sleep in the Cave of the Nativity.

   The Holy Family is now deeply joyful. Anna is blissfully happy. Mary
   often lays the Infant Jesus in her arms for her to nurse. I did not see
   her do that with anyone else. I saw, to my great wonderment, that the
   Infant's hair, which is yellow and curly, ends in little fine rays of
   light intersecting each other. I think they make his hair curly, for I
   see them rubbing his head after washing it. They put a little cloak
   round him the while. I always see in the Holy Family the most touching
   and devout honor being paid to the Infant Jesus, but it is all quite
   simple and human, as it always is with holy and elect ones. The Child
   turns to His Mother with love such as I have never seen in one so
   young.

   Mary told her mother all about the visit of the three holy kings, and
   Anna was greatly moved on hearing that the Lord God had summoned them
   from so far to acknowledge the Child of the Promise. She was shown the
   gifts of the kings, which were hidden in a wicker basket in a covered
   niche in the wall. She recognized them as tokens of homage and gazed at
   them with deep humility. She helped to give away some of them and to
   arrange and pack up the rest. All is now quiet in the neighborhood; all
   the paths except the one through the gate of the town have been closed
   by the authorities. Joseph no longer goes to Bethlehem for what he
   wants; the shepherds bring him everything needful. The kinswoman with
   whom Anna stayed in Benjamin is Mara [136] , the daughter of
   Elizabeth's sister Rhoda. She is poor, and later had several sons, who
   became disciples. One of them was called Nathanael and was later the
   bridegroom at Cana. This Mara was present at the Blessed Virgin's death
   at Ephesus.

   This Nathanael is not the one whom Jesus saw under the fig tree.
   Nathanael, Mara's son, was present as a boy at the children's festival
   given by Anna for the twelve-year-old Jesus, when He came home after
   His first teaching in the Temple. The boy Jesus told on this occasion a
   parable of a wedding where water was to be turned into wine, and of
   another wedding, where wine was to be turned into blood. He told the
   boy Nathanael, as if in jest, that one day He would be present at
   Nathanael's wedding. The bride of Cana came from Bethlehem, from
   Joseph's family. After the miracle at Cana the bridegroom and the bride
   made a mutual vow of continence. Nathanael at once became a disciple
   and received the name Amator in baptism. Later he was made a bishop and
   was in Edessa; he was also on the island of Crete with Carpus. He then
   went to Armenia, and because of the many conversions he made he was
   captured and sent into exile to the shores of the Black Sea. On being
   set free he came into Mensor's land, where he worked a miracle (which I
   have forgotten) on a woman and baptized so many people that he was done
   to death, in the city of Acajacuh on an island in the River Euphrates.
   [137]

   Today Anna sent away her husband Eliud with a loaded donkey and the
   maidservant, her relation, with two big packs. She carried one on her
   back and one in front. These contain part of the kings' gifts, stuffs
   of various kinds and golden vessels, which in later years were used at
   the first Christian religious services. They are sending everything
   away in secret, for some sort of investigation is always going on about
   here. It seems as though they are only taking these things to some
   place on the way to Nazareth whence they will be fetched by servants,
   for in earlier visions I saw Eliud back in Bethlehem at Anna's
   departure thence, which will soon take place. Anna was now alone with
   Mary in the side-cave. I saw that they were working together, plaiting
   and knitting a coarse blanket. The Cave of the Nativity is now
   completely cleared out. Joseph's donkey is hidden behind wicker
   screens. Today there were again officers of Herod in Bethlehem,
   searching in a number of houses for a newborn child.

3. THE HOLY FAMILY HIDES IN THE BURIAL CAVE OF MARAHA.

   Soldiers came, too, looking for a newborn son of a king. They were
   particularly persistent in their questioning of a distinguished Jewish
   woman who had lately given birth to a son. They did not go near the
   Cave of the Nativity; they had been there before and found only a poor
   family, so took for granted that it was nothing to do with these. Two
   old men, shepherds I think, came to Joseph and warned him of these
   inquiries. That was why I saw the Holy Family and Anna escaping into
   Maraha's grave with the Infant Jesus. There was nothing left in the
   Cave of the Nativity to show that it had been lived in; it looked quite
   deserted. I saw them going through the valley in the night with a
   covered light. Anna held the Infant Jesus before her in her arms, Mary
   and Joseph walking beside her. The shepherds accompanied them, carrying
   the blankets and other things to make resting-places for the holy women
   and the Infant Jesus. (I had a vision meanwhile; I do not know whether
   the Holy Family saw it, too. Round the Infant Jesus at Anna's breast I
   saw a glory of seven figures of angels, intertwining and superimposed
   on each other. Many other figures appeared in this glory, and beside
   Anna, Joseph, and Mary I saw figures of light who seemed to be leading
   them by the arms.) On reaching the passage into the cave, they shut the
   door and then went into the cave itself and prepared their
   resting-places there.

4. JOSEPH TAKES THE BABY JESUS FROM MARY BECAUSE OF DANGER.

   [December 27 ^th:] The Blessed Virgin told her mother all about the
   three kings, and they looked at all the things that the latter had
   yesterday left behind in Maraha's grave. I saw two shepherds come and
   warn the Blessed Virgin that people were coming from the authorities to
   look for her Child. Mary was in great distress at this, and soon after
   I saw St. Joseph come in and take the Infant Jesus from her arms. He
   wrapped Him in a cloak and took Him away; I can no longer remember
   where to. I now saw the Blessed Virgin for at least half a day alone in
   the cave without the Infant Jesus and full of a mother's fear and
   anxiety. When the time came near for her to be called to give suck to
   the Child, she did as all good mothers are wont to do after being
   alarmed or upset: before suckling the Child she pressed out from her
   breast the disturbed milk, letting it fall into a little hollow in the
   white stone bench in the cave. This she told to a good devout shepherd
   who came to her (probably to lead her to the Child). He, deeply
   sensible of the holiness of the Mother of the Redeemer, afterwards
   scooped carefully out with a sort of spoon the virgin milk enclosed in
   the little white hollow of the stone. In his simple faith he brought it
   to his wife, who was suckling a child but had not enough milk to feed
   it. The good woman drank this holy nourishment with reverent
   trustfulness, and at once her faith was rewarded, so that she was able
   to feed her child abundantly. Since then the white stone in this cave
   was given a similar healing power, and I saw that right up to our own
   day even Mohammedans, though unbelievers, use it as a remedy in this as
   in other bodily ailments. The earth from this place was for ages
   cleansed and pressed into small moulds by the guardians of the Holy
   Land and distributed throughout Christendom as a pious remembrance.
   These relics bear the inscription de lacte sanctissimae Virginis
   Mariae' (of the milk of the Most Holy Virgin Mary').

5. COMMEMORATION OF MARY'S WEDDING.

   Joseph did not remain hidden in the grave of Maraha. I saw him making
   all sorts of arrangements in the Cave of the Nativity with the two old
   shepherds. I saw the shepherds carrying in wreaths of leaves and
   flowers, but did not at first know why they were doing this; afterwards
   I saw that they were the preparations for a very touching ceremony. I
   saw Eliud, Anna's second husband, there once more, and also the
   maidservant. They had brought two donkeys with them. They had probably
   met Anna's menservants when the latter had come only part of the way
   from Nazareth with the animals, and had then sent the men and the
   baggage back to Nazareth and brought the donkeys to Bethlehem
   themselves. When I saw them on their way back here, I thought for some
   time that they were people from an inn outside Jerusalem where I saw
   the Holy Family staying later. Joseph had made use of the absence of
   the Blessed Virgin in Maraha's grave to decorate the Cave of the
   Nativity, with the help of the shepherds, in honor of the anniversary
   of their wedding. When all was in order, he fetched the Blessed Virgin
   with the Infant Jesus and Anna, and led them into the decorated Cave of
   the Nativity. Eliud and the maidservant and the three old shepherds
   were already there. How moving it was to see their joy when the Blessed
   Virgin carried the Infant Jesus into the cave! The roof and wails of
   the cave were hung with wreaths of flowers, and a table was set for a
   meal in the center. Some of the three holy kings' beautiful carpets
   were spread on the floor and table and hung on the walls. On the table
   a pyramid of foliage and flowers rose to an opening in the roof: on the
   topmost twig there was a dove which had, I think, been made for the
   occasion. I saw the whole cave full of lights and brightness. They had
   put the Infant Jesus sitting up in His basket-cradle on a stool. Mary
   and Joseph, crowned with wreaths, stood beside Him and drank out of one
   goblet. Besides the relations the old shepherds were present. They sang
   hymns and partook happily of a light meal. I saw choirs of angels and
   heavenly powers appearing in the cave. All present were filled with
   emotion and fervor. After this ceremony the Blessed Virgin with the
   Infant Jesus and Anna again betook themselves to the grave of Maraha.

6. PREPARATIONS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THE HOLY FAMILY.

   [December 28 ^th to 30 ^th:] In the last few days and again today I
   have seen St. Joseph making various preparations for the approaching
   departure of the Holy Family from Bethlehem. He got rid every day of
   some of his household belongings. He is giving the shepherds all the
   light wicker screens and other contrivances for making the cave
   comfortable, and they are taking them all away. This afternoon there
   were again many people at the cave on their way to Bethlehem for the
   Sabbath, but finding it forsaken they soon went on. Anna is going back
   to Nazareth after the Sabbath. Today they are arranging and packing up
   everything. Anna is taking with her on two donkeys many of the gifts of
   the three holy kings, especially carpets, coverings, and stuffs. They
   kept the Sabbath this evening in Maraha's grave, and continued keeping
   it the next day (Saturday), when all was quiet in the neighborhood.

   [Saturday, December 29 ^th:] When the Sabbath was ended, all
   preparations were made for the departure for Nazareth of Anna and Eliud
   and their servants. Once, and again tonight for the second time, I saw
   the Blessed Virgin carry the Infant Jesus in the dark from the grave of
   Maraha into the Cave of the Nativity. She laid Him on a carpet at the
   place of His birth and knelt down in prayer beside Him. I saw the whole
   cave full of heavenly light as at the moment when Our Lord was born. I
   think that the dear Mother of God must have seen that, too.

   [Sunday, December 30 ^th:] At early dawn I saw Anna, with her husband
   and servants, start for Nazareth after taking a tender farewell of the
   Holy Family and the three old shepherds. Anna's maidservant went with
   them, and I was again astonished by her strange cap, which was almost
   like a cuckoo-basket', the name given by our peasant children at home
   to a pointed cap they plait from reeds in their games. (The reason why
   I thought for some time that Anna's husband and maidservant were people
   from the inn outside Jerusalem may have been that I had seen them
   spending the night in that inn and conversing with its owners.) They
   took all that still remained of the kings' gifts and packed them on
   their beasts. While they were doing this, I was very much astonished to
   see them taking with them a package belonging to me. I felt that it was
   there, and could not at all make out what had induced Anna to take my
   property away with her.

  XV. PERSONAL NOTES: RELICS NEARBY THAT THE THREE KINGS HAD GIVEN TO THE HOLY
                                    FAMILY.

   Soon after this expression of surprise that Anna should take away from
   Bethlehem something belonging to her, Sister Emmerich, the following
   dialogue took place between the latter (who was in a visionary state of
   great intensity) and the writer.

   Sister Emmerich: When Anna went away, she took with her many of the
   kings' gifts, especially stuffs. Some of these were used in the first
   Christian Church, and pieces have survived until our own time. A piece
   of the cloth that covered the little table on which the kings laid
   their presents and a piece of one of their cloaks are among my own
   relics.' [138] Since some of these relics were in a little cupboard
   beside her bed, while others were in the writer's house, he asked: Are
   these relics of stuff here?'

   Catherine Emmerich: No, over there in the house.'

   The writer: In my house?'

   Catherine Emmerich: No, in the pilgrim's house (her usual name for the
   writer). They are in a little bundle. The piece of the cloak is faded.
   People will not believe it, but it is true, all the same, and I see it
   before my eyes.' When the writer brought the relics kept in his house
   in what might certainly be described as little bundles', she opened one
   of these at once and identified a little piece of dark red silk as part
   of the kings' stuffs, without, however, giving any more precise
   explanation about it. She then said: I am sure I have another little
   piece of the kings' stuffs. They had several cloaks: a thick strong one
   for bad weather, a yellow one, and a red one of very thin light wool.
   These cloaks blew in the wind as they went. At their ceremonies they
   wore cloaks of shining undyed silk, embroidered at the edge with gold.
   These had long trains which had to be carried. I think that a piece of
   a cloak like this must be near me, and that is why tonight and before
   that I was watching silk being produced and woven in the country of the
   kings. I remember that in an eastern land, between Theokeno's and
   Seir's countries, there were trees full of silkworms, with little
   ditches of water round each tree to prevent the silkworms from
   escaping. I sometimes saw them strewing leaves under the trees, and I
   saw little boxes hanging from their branches. Out of these boxes they
   took little round things more than a finger in length. I thought, at
   first, they were some strange kind of birds' eggs, but I soon saw that
   they were the cocoons which the worms had spun round themselves, for I
   saw people winding off threads as fine as gossamer. I saw them
   fastening a mass of this on their breasts and spinning from it a fine
   thread, rolling it up on something they held in their hands. I saw them
   also weaving among trees: the loom looked white, it was quite simple,
   and the woven stuff must have been about the breadth of my sheet.'

   A few days later she said: My doctor has often questioned me about a
   piece of very curiously woven silk. A short time ago I saw a similar
   piece in my room, but do not know what has become of it. I have been
   thinking over it, and realized that I had a vision of the women weaving
   silk in a country to the east of the countries of the three kings. It
   was in the country that St. Thomas visited. I made a mistake: it does
   not belong to the holy kings' stuff, so the pilgrim must cross that
   out. Somebody gave it to me as a senseless sort of test, without
   considering what I was contemplating internally at that moment: this
   causes sad confusion. Now, however, I have seen the relics again and
   know where they are. Several years ago I gave a little packet, sewn
   together like a knob, to my sister-in-law who lives at Flamske. It was
   before her last confinement, and she had begged me for some kind of
   holy relic to support her; so I gave her this little bundle, which I
   saw shining and as though it had once been in contact with the Mother
   of God. I cannot remember whether I looked through its whole contents
   at the time, but the good woman got great comfort from it. It contains
   a little piece of dark red carpet and two little pieces of thin woven
   stuff, like crêpe, of the color of raw silk; also a piece of some stuff
   like green calico, a tiny piece of wood, and a few little splinters of
   white stone. I have sent a message to my sister-in-law to bring them
   back to me.'

   A few days later her sister-in-law paid her a visit and brought the
   little packet, which was about the size of a walnut. The writer undid
   it very carefully at home, and separated the remnants of stuff which
   were twisted together in it, moistening them and pressing them flat
   between the leaves of a book. These consisted of about two square
   inches of thick coarse woolen stuff woven in a very faded flowered
   pattern, in color dark reddish brown and in places dark purple. There
   were also strips, two fingers in length and breadth, of loose, thin
   woven stuff like muslin, of the color of raw silk; and a little piece
   of wood and a few splinters of stone. In the evening he held the pieces
   of stuff, which he had put inside note-paper, in front of her eyes. Not
   knowing what it was, she said first: What am I to do with these
   letters?' Then, as soon as she had taken the closed letters one by one
   in her hand, she said: You must keep that carefully and not allow one
   thread of it to be lost. The thick stuff that looks brown now was once
   a deep red; it was part of a carpet as big as my room; the servants of
   the kings spread it out in the Cave of the Nativity, and Mary sat on it
   with the Infant Jesus while the kings swung their censers. Afterwards
   she always kept it in the cave, and she put it on the donkey when she
   went to Jerusalem for the Presentation of the Infant Jesus in the
   Temple. The thin crêpe-like stuff is a piece of a short cloak of three
   separate strips of stuff which the kings wore fastened to their
   collars. It was like a ceremonial stole and fluttered over back and
   shoulders. It had a fringe with tassels. The splinters of wood and
   stone are of a later time: they come from the Promised Land.'

   During these days she saw, in her consecutive visions of the Ministry
   of Jesus, the events of January 27 ^th in the year of His death. She
   saw Our Lord on His way to Bethany in an inn near Bethoron [139] with
   seventeen disciples. He taught them about their calling and kept the
   Sabbath with them: the lamp was burning the whole day. Among these
   disciples is one who has lately followed Him from Sychar. I saw him so
   plainly; some of his bones must be among my relics, a little thin white
   splinter. His name sounds like Silan or Vilan, those are the letters I
   see.' Finally she said: Silvanus', adding after a while: I have once
   more seen the little pieces of stuff which I possess belonging to the
   three kings. There must be another little bundle there; among its
   contents are a piece of King Mensor's cloak, a piece of a red silk
   covering which was beside the Holy Sepulcher in old days, and a piece
   of the red and white stole of a saint. I also see the little
   bone-splinter of the disciple Silvanus in it.' [140] After an interval
   of absence of mind, she said: I see now where that little bundle is.
   Eighteen months ago I gave it to a woman here to hang round her neck.
   She is still wearing it, and I will ask her to give it back to me. She
   was so sympathetic when I was arrested [141] that I gave it to her to
   wear to console her. I did not then know its exact contents, I only saw
   that it shone, that it was a holy relic and had been in contact with
   the Mother of God. Now that I have seen everything to do with the three
   holy kings so clearly, I recognize everything round me that has to do
   with them, including these relics of stuffs. I had forgotten where all
   these things were.

   A few days later, when the little package returned, she gave it to the
   writer to open, as she herself was ill. He undid the little old bundle
   (which had been firmly sewn up years before) in the room opening into
   Catherine Emmerich's, and found the following objects in it, tightly
   wrapped round each other:

   (1) A narrow little strip (like a rolled-up hem) of natural-colored
   woven material of some very soft wool too fragile and thin to unfold.

   (2) Two pieces of yellowish cotton material, loosely woven but quite
   strong, a finger in length and half that in breadth.

   (3) A square inch of patterned crimson silk material.

   (4) A square quarter-inch of silk brocade, yellow and white.

   (5) A little piece of green and brown silk material.

   (6) In the middle of all this was a folded paper containing a white
   stone the size of a pea.

   The writer put all these objects in separate pieces of paper, except
   No. (6), which he left in its old paper. When he brought them to
   Catherine Emmerich, who did not seem to be in a visionary state, she
   coughed and complained of violent pains, but then said: What are those
   letters you have? They are shining: what treasures we possess, more
   valuable than a kingdom.' She then took the closed letters (the
   contents of which it was impossible for her to know) one by one,
   weighing each in her hand. She was silent for a few moments, as though
   looking within herself, and, as she handed each back, gave the
   following information about their contents without making a single
   mistake (for the writer tested what she said by at once opening the
   letters, which were all exactly alike, as she handed them back).

   (1) This comes from a coat of Mensor's; it is of very fine wool. It had
   armholes and no sleeves. A piece of stuff hung from the shoulder to the
   elbow like the half of a slit-up sleeve. She then exactly described the
   shape, material, and color of the relic.

   (2) This is from a cloak left behind by the kings. She again described
   the nature of the relic.

   (3) This is a piece of a covering of thick red silk which was spread
   out on the floor of the Holy Sepulcher when the Christians were still
   in possession of Jerusalem. When the Turks conquered the city, this
   silk was still as good as new. It was cut into pieces when the knights
   divided everything, and each one received a piece as a remembrance.

   (4) This is from the stole of a very holy priest named Alexius. I think
   he was a Capuchin, and he was always praying at the Holy Sepulcher. The
   Turks mishandled him grievously. They stabled their horses in the
   church, and made an old Turkish woman go and stand before the Holy
   Sepulcher where he was praying. He paid no attention and went on with
   his prayers. Finally they walled him up there, and made the old woman
   give him bread and water through an opening. I remember this much from
   a great deal that I saw lately when I saw the little bundle and its
   contents without knowing for certain where they were.

   (5) This is not a holy relic, but is worthy of respect. It is taken
   from the seats and benches on which the princes and knights sat in a
   circle in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. This, like the red silk,
   was divided up amongst them.

   (6) In this is a little stone from the chapel above the Holy Sepulcher,
   and also the little splinter of the bone of Silvanus, the disciple of
   Sychar.

   When the writer said that there was no bone-splinter in it, she said Go
   and look'. He went at once into the next room to the light, opened the
   folded-up paper carefully, and found in a fold of it a fine white
   splinter of bone, of the thickness of a finger-nail, irregular in shape
   and the size of a sixpenny piece, exactly as she had described it. She
   recognized it at once. All this happened in the evening in the darkness
   of her room. The light was burning in the ante-room.

                      XVI. THE PURIFICATION OF MARY [142]

   The days being nearly fulfilled when the Blessed Virgin must, according
   to the Law, present and redeem her firstborn in the Temple, [143] all
   was prepared for the Holy Family's journey first to the Temple and then
   to their home in Nazareth. On the evening of Sunday, December 30 ^th,
   the shepherds had been given everything left behind by Anna's servants.
   The Cave of the Nativity, the side-cave, and Maraha's grave were all
   completely swept out and emptied. Joseph left them all quite clean. In
   the night of Sunday, December 30 ^th, to Monday, December 31 ^st, I saw
   Joseph and Mary with the Child visiting the Cave of the Nativity once
   more and taking leave of that holy place. They spread out the kings'
   carpet on Jesus' birthplace, laid the Child on it and prayed, and
   finally laid it on the place where He had been circumcised, kneeling
   down in prayer there, too. At dawn on Monday, December 31 ^st, I saw
   the Blessed Virgin mount the donkey, which the old shepherds had
   brought to the cave all equipped for the journey. Joseph held the Child
   while she settled herself comfortably; then he laid Him in her lap. She
   sat sideways on the saddle with her feet on a rather high support,
   facing backwards. She held the Child on her lap wrapped in her big veil
   and looked down on Him with an expression of great happiness. There
   were only a few rugs and small bundles on the donkey. Mary sat between
   them. The shepherds accompanied them part of their way before taking a
   moving farewell of them. They did not take the way by which they had
   come, but went between the Cave of the Nativity and the grave of
   Maraha, round the east side of Bethlehem. Nobody noticed them.

   [January 30 ^th:] This morning I saw them going very slowly on the
   short journey from Bethlehem to Jerusalem: they must have made many
   halts. At midday I saw them resting on benches round a fountain with a
   roof over it. I saw some women coming to the Blessed Virgin and
   bringing her jugs with balsam and small loaves of bread. The Blessed
   Virgin's sacrifice for the Temple hung in a basket at the side of the
   donkey. This basket had three compartments, two of which were lined
   with something. These contained fruit. The third was of open wickerwork
   and a couple of doves could be seen in it. Towards evening I saw them
   enter a small house beside a large inn about a quarter of an hour from
   Jerusalem. This was kept by an old childless couple who welcomed them
   with particular affection. I now know why I mistook Anna's companions
   yesterday for the people from an inn in Jerusalem: I had seen them
   stopping here with these good old people on their way to Bethlehem,
   when they had no doubt arranged about a lodging for the Blessed Virgin.
   The old couple were Essenes and related to Joanna Chuza. The husband
   was a gardener by trade, trimmed hedges, and was employed in work on
   the road.

   [February 1 ^st:] I saw the Holy Family with these old innkeepers near
   Jerusalem during the whole of today. The Blessed Virgin was generally
   alone in her room with the Child, who lay on a rug on a low ledge
   projecting from the wall. She was praying all the time, and seemed to
   be preparing herself for the coming ceremony. It was revealed to me at
   the same time how one should prepare oneself for receiving Holy
   Communion.

   I saw the appearance of a number of holy angels in her room,
   worshipping the Infant Jesus. I do not know whether the Blessed Virgin
   also saw these angels, but I think so, because I saw her rapt in
   contemplation. The good people of the inn did everything possible to
   please the Blessed Virgin: they must have been aware of the holiness of
   the Infant Jesus.

   About seven o'clock in the evening I had a vision of the aged Simeon.
   He was a thin, very old man with a short beard. He was an ordinary
   priest, was married, and had three grown-up sons, the youngest of whom
   might have been about twenty. I saw Simeon, who lived close to the
   Temple, going through a narrow dark passage in the Temple walls into a
   small vaulted cell, built in the thickness of the wall. I saw nothing
   in this room but an opening through which one could look down into the
   Temple. I saw the aged Simeon kneeling here rapt in prayer. Then the
   appearance of an angel stood before him and warned him to take heed of
   the little child who should be first presented early next morning, for
   this was the Messiah for whom he had so long yearned. After he had seen
   Him, he would soon die. I saw this so plainly; the room was
   illuminated, and the holy old man was radiant with joy. Then I saw him
   going to his house and telling his wife with great joy what had been
   announced to him. After his wife had gone to bed, I saw Simeon betake
   himself to prayer again.

   I never saw devout Israelites and their priests praying with such
   exaggerated gestures as the Jews today. I did, however, see them
   scourging themselves. I saw the prophetess Anna praying in her cell and
   having a vision about the Presentation of the Infant Jesus in the
   Temple.

   [February 2 ^nd:] This morning, while it was still dark, I saw the Holy
   Family, accompanied by the people of the inn, leaving the inn and going
   to Jerusalem to the Temple with the baskets of offerings and with the
   donkey laden for the journey. They went into a walled courtyard in the
   Temple. While Joseph and the innkeeper stabled the donkey in a shed,
   the Blessed Virgin and her Child were kindly received by an aged woman
   and led into the Temple by a covered passage. A light was carried, for
   it was still dark. No sooner had they entered this passage than the
   aged priest Simeon came, full of expectation, towards the Blessed
   Virgin. After addressing a few friendly words to her, he took the Child
   Jesus in his arms, pressed Him to his heart, and then hurried back to
   the Temple by another way. Yesterday's message from the angel had so
   filled him with longing to see the Child of the Promise, for whom he
   had sighed so long, that he had come out here to the place where the
   women arrived. He was dressed in long garments such as the priests wear
   when not officiating. I often saw him in the Temple, and always as an
   aged priest of no elevated rank. His great devoutness, simplicity, and
   enlightenment alone distinguished him.

   The Blessed Virgin was led by her guide to the outer courts of the
   Temple where the ceremony took place, and she was here received by
   Noemi, her former teacher, and Anna, who both lived on this side of the
   Temple. Simeon, who now once more came out of the Temple to meet the
   Blessed Virgin, led her, with her Child in her arms, to the customary
   place for the redemption of the firstborn. Anna, to whom Joseph gave
   the basket with the offerings, followed her with Noemi. The doves were
   in the lower part of the basket; above them was a compartment with
   fruit. Joseph went by another door into the place set apart for men.

   It must have been known in the Temple that several women were coming
   for the presentation ceremony, for everything was arranged. The room
   where the ceremony took place was as big as the parish church here in
   Dülmen. Many lamps were burning on its walls, forming pyramids of
   light. The little flames are at the end of a bent tube projecting from
   a golden disc which shines almost as brightly as the flame. Hanging
   from this disc by a woven cord is a little extinguisher which is used
   to put out the light without making any smell and removed again when
   the lamps are lit.

   An oblong chest had been brought out by several priests and set before
   a kind of altar with what looked like horns at each corner. The doors
   of this chest were opened to form a stand on which a large tray was
   laid. This was covered first with a red cloth, and then with a
   transparent white one, which hung down to the ground on each side.
   Burning lamps with several branches were placed at the four corners of
   this table, in the middle of which was an oblong cradle flanked by two
   oval bowls containing two baskets. All these things had been brought
   out of drawers in the chest, with priests' vestments, which were laid
   on the other permanent altar. The table which had been set up for the
   offering was surrounded by a railing. On each side of this room were
   seats, raised one above the other, in which were priests saying
   prayers.

   Simeon now approached the Blessed Virgin, in whose arms the Infant
   Jesus lay wrapped in a sky-blue covering, and led her through the
   railing to the table, where she laid the Child in the cradle. From this
   moment I saw an indescribable light filling the Temple. I saw that God
   Himself was in it, and above the Child I saw the heavens opening to
   disclose the Throne of the Holy Trinity. Simeon then led the Blessed
   Virgin back to the women's place. Mary wore a pale sky-blue dress, with
   a white veil, and was completely enveloped in a long yellow cloak.
   Simeon then went to the permanent altar on which the vestments had been
   laid out, and he and three other priests vested each other for the
   ceremony. They had a kind of little shield on their arms, and on their
   heads were caps divided like miters. One went behind and the other in
   front of the table of offering, while two others stood at the narrow
   ends of it praying over the Child. Anna now came up to Mary and handed
   her the basket of offerings, which contained fruit and doves in two
   separate compartments, one above the other. She led her to the railing
   in front of the table, and there both remained standing. Simeon, who
   was standing before the table, opened the railing, led Mary up to the
   table, and placed her offering on it. Fruit was placed in one of the
   oval dishes and coins in the other: the doves remained in the basket.
   [144] Simeon remained standing with Mary before the table of offering,
   and the priest who stood behind it lifted the Infant Jesus from the
   cradle and held Him up towards the different sides of the Temple,
   making a long prayer the while. He then gave the Child to Simeon, who
   laid Him once more in Mary's arms and prayed over her and the Child
   from a scroll hanging on a stand beside him. Simeon then led the
   Blessed Virgin back to where Anna was waiting for her in front of the
   railing, after which Anna took her back to the railed-off women's
   enclosure. Here some twenty women were waiting to present their
   firstborn. Joseph and the other men were standing farther back in the
   place for men.

   The priests at the permanent altar now began a service with incense and
   prayers. The priests in the seats took part in this service, making
   gestures, but not such violent ones as the Jews of today. At the close
   of this ceremony, Simeon came up to where Mary was standing, took the
   Infant Jesus from her into his arms, speaking long and loudly over Him
   in raptures of joy and thanking God that He had fulfilled His Promise.
   He ended with his Nunc Dimittis [ Luke 2.29-32]. After the Presentation
   Joseph came up, and he and Mary listened with great reverence to
   Simeon's inspired words to the Blessed Virgin [ Luke 2.34]. When Simeon
   had finished speaking, the prophetess Anna was also filled with
   inspiration, and spoke long and loudly about the Infant Jesus, hailing
   His Mother as blessed. I saw that those who were present were greatly
   moved by all this, and the priests, too, seemed to hear something of
   what was happening; but no sort of disturbance was caused thereby. It
   seemed as if this loud inspired praying was nothing unusual, as if it
   often happened, and as if it must all be so. At the same time I saw
   that the hearts of all the bystanders were much moved, and all showed
   great reverence to the Child and His Mother. Mary was like a heavenly
   rose in radiance.

   The Holy Family had, in appearance, made the most humble offering; but
   Joseph gave Anna and the aged Simeon many of the triangular yellow
   pieces in secret, to be used specially for poor girls who were being
   brought up in the Temple and could not afford the expense.

   I saw the Blessed Virgin and her Child being accompanied by Anna and
   Noemi back to the outer court, whence they had fetched her, and there
   they took leave of each other. Joseph was there already with the two
   people from the inn; he had brought the donkey which carried Mary and
   the Child, and they started at once on their journey from the Temple
   through Jerusalem to Nazareth. I did not see the presentation of the
   other firstborn children that day, but I feel that they were all given
   a special grace, and that many of them were among the massacred
   Innocents.

   The Presentation must have ended about nine o'clock this morning, for
   it was at this time that I saw the departure of the Holy Family. That
   day they traveled as far as Bethoron, where they spent the night at the
   house which had been the last stopping-place of the Blessed Virgin when
   she was brought to the Temple thirteen years before. The owner of this
   house seemed to me to be a schoolteacher. Servants sent by Anna were
   waiting here for them. They went to Nazareth by a much more direct road
   than on their way to Bethlehem, when they had avoided all towns and had
   only stopped at lonely houses. Joseph had left in pledge with his
   relations the young she ass which had shown him the way on their
   journey to Bethlehem, for he still intended to return to Bethlehem and
   build a house in the Shepherds' Valley. He had spoken to the shepherds
   about it, and told them that he was taking Mary to her mother only for
   a time until she should have recovered from the discomfort of her
   lodging. With this plan in his mind, he had left a good many things
   with the shepherds. Joseph had a strange kind of money with him; I
   think he must have been given it by the three kings. Inside his robe he
   had a kind of pouch, in which he carried a quantity of little thin
   shining yellow leaves rolled up in each other. Their corners were
   rounded and something was scratched on them. Judas' pieces of silver
   were thicker and tongue-shaped; the whole pieces were rounded at both
   ends and the half pieces at one end only.

1. A VIEW OF THE THREE HOLY KINGS ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME.

   At this time I saw all three kings together again beyond a river. They
   had a day of rest and kept a feast. At this place there was one big
   house with several smaller ones. The direction taken by the kings on
   their way home lies between the road they followed on their journey to
   Bethlehem and that by which Jesus came out of Egypt in the third year
   of His ministry. At first they traveled very quickly, but after this
   resting-place their pace was much slower than when they came. I always
   saw a shining youth going before them and sometimes talking with them.
   They left Ur on the right.

2. SIMEON'S DEATH.

   [February 3 ^rd:] Simeon had a wife and three sons, of whom the eldest
   was about forty and the youngest twenty years old. All three served in
   the Temple, and were later secret friends of Jesus and His followers.
   All became disciples of Our Lord, but at different times: before His
   death or after His ascension. At the Last Supper one of them prepared
   the Paschal Lamb for Jesus and the Apostles; but these were perhaps
   grandsons, not sons, of Simeon; I am not sure. Simeon's sons did much
   to help the friends of Our Lord at the time of the first persecutions
   after the Ascension. Simeon was related to Seraphia, who was later
   given the name Veronica, and also, through her father, to Zechariah.

   I saw that Simeon fell ill yesterday immediately on returning home
   after his prophecy at the Presentation of Jesus, but he spoke very
   joyfully with his wife and sons. Tonight I saw that today was to be the
   day of his death. Of the many things I saw I can only remember this
   much. Simeon, from the couch where he lay, spoke earnestly to his wife
   and children, telling them of the salvation that was come to Israel and
   of everything that the angel had announced to him. His joy was touching
   to behold. Then I saw him die peacefully and heard the quiet
   lamentation of his family. Many other old priests and Jews were praying
   round his bed. Then I saw them carry his body into another room. They
   placed it on a board pierced with holes, and washed it with sponges,
   holding a cloth over it so that its nakedness could not be seen. The
   water ran through the board into a copper basin placed beneath it. Then
   they covered the body with big green leaves, surrounded it with bunches
   of sweet herbs, and wrapped it in a great cloth in which it was tied up
   with long bandages like a child in swaddling bands. The body lay so
   straight and rigid that I thought the bands must have been tied right
   round the board.

   In the evening Simeon was buried. His body was carried to the grave by
   six men bearing torches. It lay on a board more or less the shape of a
   body, but surrounded by an edge higher in the middle of its four sides
   and lower at the corners. The wrapped-up corpse lay on this board
   without any other covering. The bearers and those who followed them
   walked quicker than is usual at our burials. The grave was on a hill
   not very far from the Temple. The door of the sepulcher was set
   slanting against a little hill. It was walled inside with a strange
   kind of masonry like that which I saw St. Benedict working at in his
   first monastery. [145] The walls, like those in the Blessed Virgin's
   cell in the Temple, were decorated with stars and other patterns in
   colored stones. The little cave in the middle of which they laid the
   corpse was just large enough to allow them to pass round the body.
   There were some other funeral customs such as laying various things
   beside the dead man--coins, little stones, and I think also food, but I
   am not sure.

3. THE ARRIVAL OF THE HOLY FAMILY AT ST. ANNE'S HOUSE.

   In the evening I saw the Holy Family arrive at Anna's house, which is
   about half an hour's distance from Nazareth in the direction of the
   valley of Zabulon. There was a little family' festival like the one
   when Mary left home for the Temple. A lamp was burning above the table.
   Joachim was dead, and I saw Anna's second husband as master of the
   house. Anna's eldest daughter, Mary Heli, was there on a visit. The
   donkey was unloaded, for Mary meant to stay here for some time. All
   were full of joy over the Infant Jesus, but it was a tranquil inner
   joy; I never saw any of these people giving way to very violent
   emotions. Some aged priests were there, and all present partook of a
   light meal. The women ate separately from the men, as is always the
   custom at meals.

   I saw the Holy Family still in Anna's house a few days later. There are
   several women there, Mary Heli, Anna's eldest daughter, with her child
   Mary Cleophas, a woman from Elizabeth's home, and the maidservant who
   was with Mary in Bethlehem. This maidservant did not wish to marry
   again after the death of her husband, who had not been a good man, and
   came to Elizabeth at Juttah, where the Blessed Virgin made her
   acquaintance when she visited Elizabeth before John's birth. From here
   this widow came to Anna. Today I saw Joseph in Anna's house packing
   many things on donkeys and going in front of the donkeys (of which
   there were two or three) towards Nazareth, accompanied by the maid.

   I cannot remember the details of all that I saw today in Anna's house,
   but I must have had a very vivid impression of it all, for while I was
   there I was in an intense activity of prayer, which is now hardly
   comprehensible to me. Before I came to Anna's house I had been in
   spirit with a young married couple who supported their old mother; they
   are both mortally ill, and if they do not recover, the mother will
   perish. I know this poor family, but have had no news of them for a
   long time. In desperate cases like this I always invoke St. Anne, and
   when I was in her house today in my vision, I saw, in spite of the
   season of the year, and though the leaves had all fallen, many pears,
   plums, and other fruit hanging on the trees in her garden. When I went
   away I was allowed to pick these, and I took the pears to the young
   couple who were ill and so cured them. After that I was made to give
   some to many other poor people, known and unknown to me, who were
   restored to health by them. No doubt these fruits signified graces
   obtained through the intercession of St. Anne. I fear that these fruits
   mean much pain and suffering for me, which always comes after visions
   in which I pick fruit in the gardens of the saints--this has always to
   be paid for. Perhaps these souls are under the protection of St. Anne,
   and are thus entitled to fruit from the garden; or perhaps it happened
   because, as I have always recognized, she is a patroness in desperate
   cases.

4. THE WEATHER IN PALESTINE.

   [When asked what sort of weather she saw in Palestine at this time of
   the year, she answered:] I always forget to mention that, because it
   seems to me all so natural that I always think everyone knows about it.
   I often see rain and mist, and sometimes a little snow, but this melts
   at once. I often see leafless trees with fruit still hanging on them. I
   see several crops in the year, and I see them beginning to harvest in
   our spring. Now that it is winter I see people going along the roads
   wrapped up, with their cloaks over their heads.

   [February 6 ^th:] This afternoon I saw the Blessed Virgin going from
   Anna's house to Joseph's house in Nazareth. She was accompanied by her
   mother, who carried the Infant Jesus. It is a very pleasant walk of
   half an hour among hills and gardens. Anna sends provisions from her
   own house to Joseph and Mary in Nazareth. How beautiful is the life of
   the Holy Family! Mary is at once the mother and the humblest handmaid
   of the Holy Child and at the same time she is Joseph's servant. Joseph
   is her faithful friend and humblest servant. When the Blessed Virgin
   rocks the Infant Jesus to and fro in her arms, how marvelous to see the
   all-merciful God, who made the world, allowing Himself out of His great
   love to be treated like a helpless little child! How dreadful in
   comparison the coldness and self-will of deceitful and hard-hearted
   men!

5. CANDLEMAS.

   The Feast of Candlemas was represented to me in a great picture, but
   one very difficult to describe, although I recollect much of what I
   saw.

   I saw a feast being celebrated in the Church, transparent and floating
   above the earth, as I always am shown the Catholic Church when I am to
   contemplate it, not as some particular local church, but as the
   Universal Church itself. I saw this Church filled with choirs of angels
   surrounding the Most Holy Trinity. Since, however, I saw the Second
   Person of that Most Holy Trinity being presented and redeemed in the
   Temple, incarnate in the form of the Infant Jesus and yet present in
   the Most Holy Trinity, it seemed to me, as it did a short time ago,
   that the Child Jesus was sitting near me and comforting me at the same
   time that I saw a vision of the Holy Trinity. I saw the appearance of
   the Word become Flesh, the Infant Jesus, at my side, connected with the
   vision of the Trinity as it were by a path of light. I could not say,
   He is not there, since He is with me', nor could I say, He is not with
   me, since He is there'. And yet, in the instant when I had a vivid
   sensation of the Child Jesus being near me, the representation of the
   Most Holy Trinity was shown to me, but in a different form from that in
   which I see it when it is a picture of the Godhead alone.

   I saw an altar appear in the center of the Church--not an altar like
   those in our churches today, but just an altar. On this altar stood a
   little tree of the same kind as the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of
   Eden, with broad hanging leaves. Then I saw the Blessed Virgin rise
   before the altar with the Infant Jesus in her arms as if she had come
   up out of the earth; and I saw the tree on the altar bow before her and
   then wither away. And I saw a great angel in priest's vestments, with
   only a ring round his head, approach Mary. She gave him the Child, whom
   he placed on the altar, and in the same moment I saw the Child thus
   offered up pass into the picture of the Holy Trinity, which I now saw
   once more in its usual form. I saw, too, that the angel gave the Mother
   of God a little bright globe surmounted by the figure of a child in
   swaddling-bands, and that Mary floated with this gift towards the
   altar. I saw crowds of poor people coming to her from all sides bearing
   lights: she handed all these lights to the Child on the globe, into
   whom they passed. And I saw a light and a radiance being thrown by
   these lights on Mary and the Child, illuminating everything. Mary had a
   flowing mantle which spread over the whole earth. The picture was then
   transformed into a festal ceremony.

   I think that the withering of the Tree of Knowledge at Mary's
   appearance, and the passing of the Child on the altar into the Holy
   Trinity signified the reunion of mankind with God. That is why I saw
   all the scattered individual lights handed to the Mother of God and
   given by her to the Child Jesus: for He was the light enlightening all
   mankind, in whom alone all the scattered lights became one light to
   enlighten the whole world, symbolized by the globe, the orb of a king.
   The lights presented to the Blessed Virgin signified the Blessing of
   the Candles at today's feast.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [142] Luke 2.22-39. (SB)

   [143] The laws about Purification' and offerings after childbirth are
   in Lev. 12.4-8, and the sanctification' of the first-born is directed
   in Exod. 13.2 and Num. 3.13. (SB)

   [144] In 1823, when recounting Jesus' stay in Hebron during the third
   year of His ministry, some ten days after the death of the Baptist,
   Catherine Emmerich said that she saw Our Lord teaching, on Friday the
   29th day of the month of Thebet (i.e. Jan. 17th), from the Sabbath
   reading taken from Exodus, Chapter 10 to Chapter 13.17. He taught about
   the Egyptian plague of darkness and about the redemption of the
   first-born. In connection with the latter she recounted once more the
   whole ceremony of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, including
   the following, omitted from the description given in the text:The
   Blessed Virgin did not present Our Lord in the Temple until the
   forty-third day after His birth. Because of the feast, she waited for
   three days with the good people of the inn outside the Bethlehem gate
   of Jerusalem. Besides the customary offering of doves, she presented to
   the Temple five triangular pieces of gold from the kings' gifts, as
   well as several pieces of beautiful stuff for embroidery. Before
   leaving Bethlehem, Joseph sold to his cousin the young she-ass which he
   had given him in pledge on Nov. 30th. I have always thought that the
   she-ass, on which Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, was a
   descendant of hers.' (CB)

   [145] In a vision of the life of St. Benedict which Catherine Emmerich
   had on Feb. 10th, 1820, she saw amongst other things that as a boy he
   was shown by his teacher how to use colored stones to make all kinds of
   ornaments and arabesques in the sand of the garden in the manner of the
   old pavements. Later she saw him, when a hermit, decorating the roof of
   his cell or cave with a reproduction in rough mosaic of a vision of the
   Last Judgment. Still later she saw St. Benedict's followers imitating
   and extending this form of decoration. After contemplating in its
   smallest details the whole history and development of his Order from
   its foundation, she said: Because in the Benedictines the inner spirit
   became less active and alive than its outer shell, I saw their churches
   and monasteries becoming too much ornamented and decorated. I thought
   to myself, that comes from the picture Benedict made in his cell; it
   has shot up like a weed, and when once this superstructure collapses,
   it will strike many of them at the same time.' (CB)

    XVI. THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT AND ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST IN THE DESERT [146]

   [On Saturday, February 10 ^th, 1821, Catherine Emmerich, who was ill at
   the time, was worried by material cares about where she was to live.
   She fell asleep full of these cares, but soon woke up quite happy. She
   said that a good friend of hers who had lately died (a pious old
   priest) had just been with her and had comforted her. How wise that
   wise man now is, and how well he can now speak! He said to me: "Do not
   be anxious about a dwelling for yourself; take care only that you are
   swept and garnished within to receive Our Lord when He comes to you.
   When Joseph came to Bethlehem, he sought a lodging for Jesus, not for
   himself, and swept the Cave of the Nativity till it was beautifully
   clean." ' She told of several other profound utterances of this friend,
   all characteristic of one who knew her temperament so well. She added
   that he said to her: When St. Joseph was told by the angel to flee into
   Egypt with Jesus and Mary, he did not worry about a dwelling-place, but
   set off at once as he was told.' As she had seen something of the
   flight into Egypt the year before at this time, the writer thought that
   this was happening again, so asked her: Was it today that Joseph
   started for Egypt?' She answered very clearly and decisively: No, the
   day he started on the flight was what is now February 29 ^th.']

1. THE AGE OF THE CHILD JESUS DURING THE FLIGHT TO EGYPT.

   [Unfortunately there was no opportunity of obtaining precise
   information from her about this, as she was very ill during these
   communications. Once she said: The Child may well be more than a year
   old, I saw Him playing about by a balsam-bush at one of the
   halting-places on the journey, and sometimes His parents led Him by the
   hand for a little way.' Another time it seemed to her that Jesus was
   nine months old. It must be left to the reader to conjecture the age of
   Jesus from the various circumstances of Catherine Emmerich's account,
   and in particular from a comparison with the age of the little John the
   Baptist, which seems to confirm the theory of Our Lord being nine
   months old.]

2. NAZARETH. THE HOUSE OF THE HOLY FAMILY.

   [Sunday, February 25 ^th:] I saw the Blessed Virgin doing knitting or
   crochet work. She had a roll of wool fastened at her right hip and she
   held in her hands two needles (of bone, I think) with little hooks. One
   must be half a yard long. The other is shorter. The needle is prolonged
   beyond the hook, and it is round this prolongation that the thread is
   looped to make the stitch in working. The part already knitted hangs
   down between the two needles. She did this work standing or sitting
   beside the Infant Jesus lying in a basket. I saw St. Joseph plaiting
   long strips of yellow, brown, and green bark to make panels for screens
   or for walls and ceilings. He had a store of these panels lying on top
   of each other in a shed near the house. He wove various patterns into
   them--stars, hearts, and other things. I felt sorry for him; he had no
   idea that he would soon have to flee into Egypt. The Blessed Virgin's
   mother comes regularly every day to visit her; it is nearly an hour's
   walk from her house.

   I had a view of Jerusalem, and saw Herod having numbers of men
   summoned, as when soldiers are called up with us. These were led into a
   large courtyard and given clothes and weapons. They wore something like
   a half-moon on one arm. They carried spears and short broad swords like
   chopping knives. They wore helmets, and many of them had wrappings tied
   round their legs. All this must have been connected with the Massacre
   of the Innocents. Herod was in a very uneasy frame of mind.

3. JERUSALEM. HEROD'S PREPARATIONS FOR THE MURDER OF THE CHILDREN.

   [February 26 ^th:] I still see Herod exceedingly uneasy, just as he was
   when the three kings asked him about the newborn King of the Jews. I
   saw him taking counsel with several old scribes, who read from very
   long parchment scrolls, fastened on rods, which they had brought with
   them. I saw, too, that the soldiers who had been given new clothes two
   days ago were sent to Bethlehem and to various places round Jerusalem.
   I think they were sent to occupy the places whence the children were to
   be brought by their unsuspecting mothers to Jerusalem. The soldiers
   were intended to prevent any insurrection when the reports of the
   massacre reached the children's homes.

4. HEROD PLACES SOLDIERS IN VARIOUS PLACES SURROUNDING JERUSALEM.

   [February 27 ^th:] Today I saw Herod's soldiers who had started
   yesterday from Jerusalem arriving at three places. They came to Hebron,
   Bethlehem, and another place, lying between those two in the direction
   of the Dead Sea. I have forgotten its name. The inhabitants had no idea
   why these soldiers had been sent to them and were somewhat disturbed.
   Herod was crafty; he kept his own counsel and sought in secret for
   Jesus. The soldiers stayed in these towns for some time; then, when
   Herod completely failed to find the child born in Bethlehem, he
   massacred all the children under two years of age.

5. PERSONAL NOTES: PRAYER DURING THE SEASON OF THE MARTYRDOM OF THE HOLY
INNOCENTS.

   [This evening at dusk Catherine Emmerich fell asleep and after a few
   minutes said, without any apparent reason: God be thanked a thousand
   times that I came at the right moment! What a blessing that I was
   there! The poor child is saved; I prayed that she should bless and kiss
   it, and after that she could no longer have thrown it into the pond.'
   The writer, on hearing this sudden exclamation, asked,' Whom do you
   mean?' She continued: It is an unfortunate girl who has been seduced.
   She was going to drown her newborn child not far from here. During the
   last few days I have besought God so earnestly that no poor innocent
   child should die without being baptized and blessed. I prayed thus
   because the time of the martyrdom of the Holy Innocents is drawing
   near. I adjured God by the blood of His first blood-witnesses. One must
   profit by the times and seasons, and every year. When the rosebuds open
   in the garden of the Church Triumphant, one must pluck them on earth.
   God has heard my prayer and enabled me to help the mother and her
   child. Perhaps one day I shall see that child.' This is what she said
   immediately after her vision, or rather after the action she took in
   spirit. Next morning she said: My guide took me quickly to M. Near
   there I saw a girl who had been seduced who had just given birth to her
   child behind a bush. She carried it in her apron towards a deep pond on
   which green scum was floating, meaning to throw the child into the
   water. I saw a tall dark figure beside her from which a dreadful kind
   of light was thrown; I think it was the evil one. I went close up to
   her, praying with my whole heart, and saw the dark figure withdraw.
   Then she took the child and kissed and blessed it, after which she
   could no longer bring herself to drown it. She sat down again, weeping
   most terribly and not knowing where to turn. I comforted her and gave
   her the idea of going to her confessor and begging him to help her. She
   did not see me, but her guardian angel gave her this advice. Her
   parents were, I think, far away. She seemed to belong to a middle-class
   family. ]

6. NAZARETH. ST. ANNE AND HER MAID BRING FOOD TO THE HOLY FAMILY.

   [February 27 ^th:] This evening I saw Anna and her eldest her house to
   Nazareth with the maidservant who was related to her--the one she had
   left with the Blessed Virgin in Bethlehem after Christ's birth. The
   maid had a bundle hanging at her side, and carried a basket on her head
   and another in her hand. They were round baskets, and you could see
   through one of them. There were birds in them. They were taking
   provisions to Mary, who did no house-keeping and was provided for by
   Anna.

7. NAZARETH. A LOOK AT THE LIFESTYLE OF THE HOLY WOMEN.

   [February 28:] This evening I saw Anna and her eldest daughter with the
   Blessed Virgin. Mary Heli had with her a sturdy little boy four or five
   years old, her grandson, the eldest son of her daughter Mary Cleophas.
   Joseph had gone to Anna's house. I watched the women sitting there,
   talking confidentially to each other, playing with the Infant Jesus and
   pressing Him to their breasts or giving Him to the little boy to hold
   in his arms. Women are always the same, I thought; it was all just as
   it is with us today.

   Mary Heli lived in a little village some three hours to the east of
   Nazareth. Her house was almost as good as her mother's: it had a walled
   courtyard with a fountain and pump. You trod on something beneath it,
   and water poured out at the top into a stone basin. Her husband was
   called Cleophas, and her daughter Mary Cleophas, who was married to
   Alpheus, lived at the other end of the village.

   In the evening I saw the women praying. They stood before a little
   table covered with a red-and-white cloth and standing against the wall.
   A scroll lay on this table, which the Blessed Virgin unrolled and hung
   up on the wall. A figure was embroidered on it in pale colors; it
   looked like a dead man in a long white cloak, wrapped up like a child
   in swaddling-bands. The head was wrapped in the cloak, which was wider
   round the arms. The figure held something in its arms. I had already
   seen this figure at the ceremony in Anna's house, when Mary was taken
   to the Temple. It reminded me then of Melchizedek, for he seemed to
   have a chalice in his arms; but another time I thought it represented
   Moses. A lamp was burning during the prayer. Mary, with her sister
   beside her, stood in front of Anna. They crossed their hands on their
   breasts, folded them, and then extended them. Mary read from a scroll
   lying before her, unrolling it as she read. They prayed in a particular
   tone and rhythm which reminded me of the chanting in the convent choir.

8. NAZARETH. AN ANGEL WAKES JOSEPH TO FLEE.

   [The night of Thursday, March 1 ^st, to the morning of Friday, March 2
   ^nd:] They are gone. I saw them start forth. Joseph came back early in
   the morning of yesterday, Thursday, from Anna's house. Anna and her
   eldest daughter were still here in Nazareth. They had all only just
   gone to bed when the angel came to warn Joseph. [147] Mary and the
   Infant Jesus had their bedroom to the right of the hearth; Anna's was
   to the left, and her eldest daughter's room was between hers and
   Joseph's. These rooms were compartments divided off and sometimes
   roofed by wicker screens. Mary's room had yet another curtain or screen
   dividing it off. The Infant Jesus lay on a rug at her feet, and she
   could pick Him up without getting out of bed.

   I saw Joseph in his room lying on his side asleep with his head on his
   arm. I saw a shining youth come up to his bed and speak with him.
   Joseph sat up, but was heavy with sleep and lay down again. The youth
   took his hand and pulled him up, when Joseph came to his senses and got
   up, on which the youth disappeared. Joseph then went to the lamp
   burning in front of the fireplace in the center of the house and lit
   his own lamp at it. He knocked at the Blessed Virgin's room and asked
   whether he might come in. I saw him go in and speak with Mary, who did
   not open the screen before her bed; then I saw him go to his donkey in
   the stable, and afterwards into a room where all kinds of things were
   kept. He prepared everything for their departure. As soon as Joseph had
   left the Blessed Virgin's room, she got up and dressed for the journey,
   before going to her mother and telling her of God's commands. Anna got
   up, as did Mary Heli and her little boy, but they let the Infant Jesus
   go on sleeping. For these good people God's Will came first of all; sad
   at heart though they were, they hastened to make all preparations for
   the journey before allowing themselves to give way to the sorrow of
   parting. Anna and Mary Heli helped to get everything ready for the
   journey. Mary did not take nearly so much with her as she had brought
   from Bethlehem. They packed up nothing but a moderate-sized bundle and
   a few blankets, which were taken out to Joseph to be loaded on the
   donkey. Everything was done quietly and very quickly, as was proper for
   a journey undertaken secretly after a warning at dead of night. When
   Mary fetched her Child, she was in such haste that I did not even see
   her wrap Him in fresh swaddling clothes. Then came the farewells, and I
   cannot describe how moving it was to see the distress of Anna and her
   eldest daughter. They embraced the Infant Jesus with tears, and the
   little boy, too, was allowed to take Him in his arms. Anna embraced the
   Blessed Virgin again and again, weeping as bitterly as if she were
   never to see her more. Mary Heli flung herself onto the ground in
   tears.

   It was not yet midnight when they left the house. Anna and Mary Heli
   accompanied the Blessed Virgin on foot for a short part of the way from
   Nazareth, Joseph following with the donkey. The way led towards Anna's
   house, but rather more to the left. Mary carried the Infant Jesus,
   wrapped in swaddling clothes, before her in a sort of sling, which went
   round her shoulders and was fastened behind her neck. [Please refer to
   Figure 21.] She wore a long cloak which wrapped both herself and the
   Child, and a big square veil, fastened round the back of her head and
   hanging in long folds beside her face. They had not gone far when
   Joseph came up with the donkey, which was carrying a skin of water and
   a basket with several compartments containing little loaves of bread,
   small jugs, and live birds. The baggage and blankets were packed round
   the side-saddle, which had a foot-rest hanging from it. They embraced
   again with tears, and Anna blessed the Blessed Virgin, who then seated
   herself on the donkey, led by Joseph, and they started off.

   [While Catherine Emmerich was describing the grief of Anna and Mary
   Heli, she wept copiously herself, saying that in the night, too, when
   she saw this vision, she could not help shedding many tears.]

9. NAZARETH. THE HOLY WOMEN PUT THINGS IN ORDER AND LEAVE JOSEPH'S HOME.

   [March 2 ^nd:] Early in the morning I saw Mary Heli with her little boy
   going to Anna's house and sending the master of the house and a
   manservant to Nazareth, after which she went to her own house. I saw
   Anna putting everything in order in Joseph's house and packing away
   many things. In the morning there came two men from Anna's house; one
   of them was dressed in nothing but a sheepskin, and had on his feet
   thick sandals strapped round his legs. The other had a long robe on; he
   seemed to me to be Anna's present husband. They helped to arrange
   everything in Joseph's house, and to pack up what was movable and take
   it to Anna's house. [148]

   Figure 21. The holy family flees from Nazareth.

   During the night of the Holy Family's flight from Nazareth, I saw them
   passing through various places and resting in a shed before dawn.
   Towards the evening, when they could go no farther, I saw them stopping
   at a village called Nazara in the house of people who lived apart and
   were rather despised. They were not proper Jews, and their religion had
   something heathen about it. They worshipped in the Temple on Mount
   Garizim, near Samaria, approached by a difficult mountain path several
   miles long. [149] They were oppressed by many hard duties, and were
   obliged to work like slaves at forced labor in the Temple at Jerusalem
   and other public buildings. These people gave a warm welcome to the
   Holy Family, who remained there the whole of the following day. On
   their return from Egypt the Holy Family once more visited these good
   people, and again when Jesus went to the Temple in His twelfth year and
   returned thence to Nazareth. [150]

   This whole family later received baptism from John and became followers
   of Jesus. This place is not far from a strange town, high up, the name
   of which I can no longer remember. I have seen and heard the names of
   so many towns in this district, among them Legio and Massaloth, between
   which, I think, Nazara lies. I believe that the town whose situation I
   thought so strange is called Legio, but it has another name as well.
   [151]

10. THE GROVE OF MOREH. ABRAHAM'S TEREBINTH TREE.

   [Sunday, March 4 ^th:] Yesterday, Saturday evening, at the close of the
   Sabbath, the Holy Family traveled on from Nazara through the night, and
   during the whole of Sunday and the following night I saw them in hiding
   by that big old terebinth tree where they had stopped in Advent on
   their journey to Bethlehem, when the Blessed Virgin was so cold. It was
   Abraham's terebinth tree, near the grove of Moreh, not far from
   Shechem, Thanath, Shiloh, and Aruma. The news of Herod's pursuit had
   spread here, and the region was unsafe for them. It was near this tree
   that Jacob buried Laban's idols. Joshua assembled the people near this
   tree and erected the tabernacle containing the Ark of the Covenant, and
   it was here that he made them renounce their idols. Abimelech, the son
   of Gideon, was hailed here as king by the people of Shechem. [152]

11. THE HOLY FAMILY RESTS BY A STREAM.

   [March 5 ^th:] This morning I saw the Holy Family resting in a fertile
   part of the country and refreshing themselves beside a little stream
   where there was a balsam bush. The Infant Jesus lay on the Blessed
   Virgin's knees with His little feet bare. Incisions had been made here
   and there in the branches of the balsam shrub, which had red berries,
   and from these incisions a liquid dripped into little pots hanging on
   the branches. I was surprised that these were not stolen. Joseph filled
   the little jugs, which he had brought with him with the balsam juice.
   They ate little loaves of bread and berries which they picked from the
   bushes growing near. The donkey drank from the stream and grazed near
   by. On their left I saw Jerusalem high up in the distance. It was a
   very lovely scene.

12. JUTTAH. ELIZABETH TAKES JOHN INTO THE WILDERNESS.

   [March 6 ^th:] Zechariah and Elizabeth had also received a message
   warning them of imminent danger. I think the Holy Family had sent them
   a trusty messenger. I saw Elizabeth taking the little John to a very
   hidden place in the wilderness, a few hours' distance from Hebron.
   [153] Zechariah accompanied them for only a part of the way, to a place
   where they crossed a small stream on a wooden beam. He then left them
   and went towards Nazareth by the way which Mary followed when she
   visited Elizabeth. I saw him on his journey to Nazareth, where he is
   probably going to obtain further details from Anna. Many of the friends
   of the Holy Family there are much distressed at their departure. Little
   John had nothing on but a lamb's skin; although scarcely eighteen
   months old, he was sure on his feet and could run and jump about. Even
   at that age he had a little white stick in his hand, which he treated
   as a plaything. One must not think of his wilderness as a great desert
   of waste sand, but rather as a desolate place with rocks, caves, and
   ravines, where bushes and wild fruits and berries grew. Elizabeth took
   the little John into a cave in which Mary Magdalen lived for some time
   after Jesus' death. I cannot remember how long Elizabeth remained here
   hidden with her young child, but it was probably only until the alarm
   about Herod's persecution had subsided. She then returned to Juttah,
   about two hours' distance away, for I saw her escaping again into the
   wilderness with John when Herod summoned the mothers with their little
   sons up to two years of age, which happened quite a year later.

   [Catherine Emmerich, who had up to this point communicated pictures of
   the Flight day by day, was here interrupted by illness and other
   disturbances. On resuming her story a few days later she said:] I
   cannot distinguish the days so clearly now, but will describe the
   separate pictures of the Flight into Egypt as nearly as possible in the
   order in which I remember seeing them.

13. EPHRAIM BY THE MAMBRE WOODS.

   I saw the Holy Family, after they had crossed some of the ridges of the
   Mount of Olives, going in the direction of Hebron beyond Bethlehem.
   They went into a large cave, about a mile from the wood of Mambre, in a
   wild mountain gorge. On this mountain was a town with a name which
   sounded like Ephraim. I think that this was the sixth halting-place on
   their journey. I saw the Holy Family arriving here very exhausted and
   distressed. Mary was very sad and was weeping. Everything they needed
   was lacking, and in their flight they kept to by-ways and avoided towns
   and public inns. They spent the whole day here resting. Several special
   favors were granted to them here. An angel appeared to them and
   comforted them, and a spring of water gushed forth in the cave at the
   prayer of the Blessed Virgin, while a wild she-goat came to them and
   allowed herself to be milked. A prophet used often to pray in this
   cave, and I think Samuel came here several times. David kept his
   father's sheep near here [154] ; he used to pray here, and it was here
   that he received from an angel the order to undertake the fight against
   Goliath. [155]

14. SOUTH OF HEBRON. JOHN SENDS THE THIRSTING JESUS A SPRING OF WATER.

   From this cave they journeyed southwards for seven hours, with the Dead
   Sea always on their left hand. Two hours after leaving Hebron they
   entered the wilderness where little John the Baptist was in hiding.
   [156] Their way led them only a bow-shot's distance from his cave. I
   saw the Holy Family wandering through a sandy desert, weary and
   careworn. The water-skin and the jugs of balsam were empty; the Blessed
   Virgin was greatly distressed, and both she and the Infant Jesus were
   thirsty. They went a little way aside from the path, where the ground
   sank, and there were bushes and some withered turf. The Blessed Virgin
   dismounted, and sat for a little with the Child on her knees, praying
   in her distress. While the Blessed Virgin was thus praying for water
   like Hagar in the wilderness, I was shown a wonderfully moving
   incident. The cave in which Elizabeth had hidden her little son was
   quite near here, on a wild rocky height, and I saw the little boy not
   far from the cave wandering about among the stones and bushes as if he
   were anxiously and eagerly waiting for something. I did not see
   Elizabeth in this vision. To see this little boy roaming and running
   about in the wilderness with such confidence made a great impression on
   me. Just as beneath his mother's heart he had leaped up at the approach
   of his Lord, so now he was moved by the nearness of his Redeemer,
   thirsty and weary. I saw the child wearing his lamb's-skin over his
   shoulders and girt round his waist, and carrying in his hand a little
   stick with a bit of bark waving on it. He felt that Jesus was passing
   near and that He was thirsty; he threw himself on his knees and cried
   to God with outstretched arms, then jumped up, ran, driven by the
   Spirit, to the high edge of the rocks and thrust with his staff into
   the ground, from which an abundant spring burst forth. John ran before
   the stream to the edge, where it rushed down over the rocks. He stood
   there and watched the Holy Family pass by in the distance. [157]

   The Blessed Virgin lifted up the Infant Jesus high in her arms, saying
   to Him, Look! John in the wilderness! '. And I saw John joyfully
   leaping about beside the rushing water, and waving to them with the
   little flag of bark on his stick. Then he hurried back into the
   wilderness. After a little time the stream reached the travelers' path,
   and I saw them crossing it and stopping to refresh themselves at a
   pleasant place where there were some bushes and thin turf. The Blessed
   Virgin dismounted with the Child; they were all joyful. Mary sat down
   on the grass, and Joseph dug a hollow a little way off for the water to
   fill. When the water became quite clear, they all drank, and Mary
   washed the Child. They sprinkled their hands, feet, and faces with
   water. Joseph led the donkey to the water, of which it drank deeply,
   and he filled his water-skin. They were all happy and thankful; the
   withered grass, now saturated with water, grew straight again, and the
   sun came out and shone on them. They sat there refreshed and full of
   quiet happiness. They rested for two or three hours in this place.

15. NEAR ANIM. THE LAST INN IN THE REGION OF HEROD.

   The last place where the Holy Family sheltered in Herod's territory was
   not far from a town on the edge of the desert, a few hours' journey
   from the Dead Sea. Its name sounded like Anem or Anim. They stopped at
   a solitary house which was an inn for those traveling through the
   desert. There were several huts and sheds on a hill, and some wild
   fruit grew round them. The inhabitants seemed to me to be
   camel-drivers, for they kept a number of camels in enclosed meadows.
   They were rather wild people and had been given to robbery, but they
   received the Holy Family well and showed them hospitality. In the
   neighboring town there were also many disorderly people who had settled
   there after fighting in the wars. Among the people in the inn was a man
   of twenty called Reuben. [158]

16. NIGHT TRAVEL. THE HOLY FAMILY STARTLES SNAKES AND FLYING LIZARDS.

   [March 8 ^th:] I saw the Holy Family journeying in a bright starlit
   night through a sandy desert covered with low bushes. I felt as if I
   were traveling through it with them. It was dangerous because of the
   numbers of snakes which lay coiled up among the bushes in little
   hollows under the leaves. They crawled towards the path, hissing loudly
   and stretching out their necks towards the Holy Family, who, however,
   passed by in safety surrounded by light. I saw other evil beasts there
   with long black bodies, short legs, and wings like big fins. They shot
   over the ground as if they were flying, and their heads were fish-like
   in shape. I saw the Holy Family come to a fall in the ground like the
   edge of a sunken road; they meant to rest there behind some bushes.

   I was alarmed for the Holy Family. The place was sinister, and I wanted
   to make a screen to protect them on the side left open, but a dreadful
   creature like a bear made his way in, and I was in terrible fear. Then
   there suddenly appeared to me a friend of mine, an old priest who had
   died lately. He was young and beautiful in form, and he seized the
   creature by the scruff of its neck and threw it out. I asked him how he
   came to be here, for surely he must be better off in his own place, to
   which he replied: I only wanted to help you, and shall not stay here
   long.' He told me more, adding that I should see him again.

17. MARA (?). AN INHOSPITABLE DESERT.

   The Holy Family always traveled a mile eastwards of the high road. The
   name of the last place they passed between Judea and the desert sounded
   very like Mara. It reminded me of Anna's home, but it was not the same
   place. The inhabitants here were rough and wild, and the Holy Family
   could obtain no assistance from them. After this they came into a great
   desert of sand. There was no path and nothing to show their direction,
   and they did not know what to do. After some time they saw a dark,
   gloomy mountain-ridge in front of them. The Holy Family were sorely
   distressed, and fell on their knees praying to God for help. A number
   of wild beasts then gathered round them, and at first it looked very
   dangerous; but these beasts were not at all evil, but looked at them in
   just the same friendly way as my confessor's old dog used to look at me
   when he came up to me. [159] I realized then that these beasts were
   sent to show them the way. They looked towards the mountain and ran in
   that direction and then back again, just like a dog does when he wants
   you to follow him somewhere. At last I saw the Holy Family follow these
   animals and pass over a mountain-ridge into a wild and lonely region.

18. THE ROBBERS HUT. THE ROBBERS BECOME FRIENDLY.

   It was dark, and the way led past a wood. In front of this wood, at
   some distance from the path, I saw a poor hut, and not far from it a
   light hanging in a tree, which could be seen from a long way off, to
   attract travelers. This part of the road was sinister: trenches had
   been dug in it here and there, and there were also trenches all round
   the hut. Hidden cords were stretched across the good parts of the road,
   and when touched by travelers rang bells in the hut and brought out its
   thieving inhabitants to plunder them. This robbers' hut was not always
   in the same place, it could be moved about and put up wherever its
   inhabitants wanted it. [160]

   When the Holy Family approached the light hanging in the tree, I saw
   the leader of the robbers with five of his companions closing round
   them. At first they were evilly disposed, but I saw that at the sight
   of the Infant Jesus a ray, like an arrow, struck the heart of the
   leader, who ordered his comrades to do no harm to these people. The
   Blessed Virgin also saw this ray strike the robber's heart, as she
   later recounted to Anna the prophetess when she returned. [161]

   The robber now led the Holy Family through the dangerous places in the
   road into his hut. It was night. In the hut was the robber's wife with
   some children. The man told his wife of the strange sensation that had
   come over him at the sight of the Child. She received the Holy Family
   shyly, but was not unfriendly. The travelers sat on the ground in a
   corner, and began to eat some of the provisions which they had with
   them. The people in the hut were at first awkward and shy (quite
   unlike, it seemed, their usual behavior), but gradually drew nearer and
   nearer to the Holy Family. Some of the other men, who had in the
   meantime stabled Joseph's donkey, came in and out, and eventually they
   all became more familiar and began to talk to the travelers. The woman
   brought Mary little loaves of bread with honey and fruit, as well as
   goblets with drink. A fire was burning in a hollow in a corner of the
   hut. The woman arranged a separate place for the Blessed Virgin, and
   brought at her request a trough with water for washing the Infant
   Jesus. She washed the linen for her and dried it at the fire. Mary
   bathed the Infant Jesus under a cloth. The man was very much agitated
   and said to his wife: This Hebrew child is no ordinary child. He is a
   holy child. Ask his mother to allow us to wash our leprous little boy
   in his bath-water, perhaps it will do him good.' As the woman came up
   to Mary to ask her this, the Blessed Virgin told her, before she had
   said a word, to wash her leprous boy in the bath-water. The woman
   brought her three-year-old son lying in her arms. He was stiff with
   leprosy and his features could not be seen for scabs. The water in
   which Jesus had been bathed seemed clearer than it had been before, and
   as soon as the leprous child had been dipped into it, the scales of his
   leprosy fell off him to the ground and the child was cleansed. The
   woman was beside herself with joy and tried to embrace Mary and the
   Infant Jesus, but Mary put out her hand and would not let her touch
   either herself or Jesus. Mary told the woman that she was to dig a well
   deep down to the rock and pour this water into it; this would give the
   well the same healing power. She spoke long with her, and I think the
   woman promised to leave this place at the first opportunity. The people
   were extremely happy at the restoration of their child to health, and
   showed him to their comrades who came in and out during the night,
   telling them of the blessing that had befallen them. The new arrivals,
   some of them boys, stood round the Holy Family and gazed at them in
   wonderment. It was all the more remarkable that these robbers were so
   respectful to the Holy Family, because in the very same night, while
   they were housing these holy guests, I saw them seizing some other
   travelers who had been enticed into their lair by the light and driving
   them into a great cave deep in the wood. This cave, whose entrance was
   hidden and grown over by wild plants so that it could not be seen,
   seemed to be their real dwelling-place. I saw several boys in this
   cave, from seven to nine years of age, who had been stolen from their
   parents; and there was an old woman who kept house there. I saw all
   kinds of booty being brought in--clothes, carpets, meat, young kids,
   sheep, and bigger animals too. The cave was big and contained an
   abundance of things.

   I saw that Mary slept little that night; she sat still on her couch
   most of the time. They left early in the morning, well supplied with
   provisions. The people of the place accompanied them a short way, and
   led them past many trenches on to the right road. When the robbers took
   leave of the Holy Family, the man said with deep emotion: Remember us
   wherever you go.' At these words I suddenly saw a picture of the
   Crucifixion, and saw the Good Thief saying to Jesus, Remember me when
   You shall come into Your kingdom', and recognized in him the boy who
   had been healed. The robber's wife gave up this way of life after some
   time, and settled with other honest families at a later resting-place
   of the Holy Family, where a spring of water and a garden of balsam
   shrubs came into being.

19. THE WILDERNESS. SNAKES AND FLYING LIZARDS.

   After this I again saw the Holy Family journeying through a desert, and
   when they lost their way, I again saw various kinds of creeping beasts
   approach them, lizards with bats' wings and snakes, but they were not
   hostile and seemed only to want to show them the way. Later on, when
   they had lost every trace of their path and direction, I saw them
   guided by a very lovely miracle; on each side of the path the plant
   called the rose of Jericho appeared with its curling leaves surrounding
   the central flower and the upright stalk. They went up to it joyfully,
   and on reaching it they saw in the distance another plant of it spring
   up, and so throughout the whole desert. I saw, too, that it was
   revealed to the Blessed Virgin that in later times the people of the
   country would gather these flowers and sell them to passing strangers
   to gain their bread. (I saw this happening afterwards.) The name of the
   place sounded like Gase or Gose [? Gosen]. Then I saw them come to a
   place called by a name like Lepe or Lape [? Pelusium]. There was a lake
   there with ditches, canals, and high embankments. They crossed the
   water on a raft with a sort of big tub on it in which the donkey was
   put. Mary sat with her Child on a piece of timber. Two ugly, brown,
   half-naked men with flattened noses and protruding lips ferried them
   over. They passed only the outlying houses of this place, and the
   people here were so rough and unsympathetic that the travelers went on
   without speaking to anyone. I think that this was the first heathen
   town. They had been ten days in the Jewish country and ten days in the
   desert.

   I now saw the Holy Family on Egyptian territory. They were in flat
   country, with green pastures here and there on which cattle were
   feeding. I saw trees to which idols had been fastened in the shape of
   infants wrapped in broad swaddling-bands inscribed with figures or
   letters. Here and there I saw people thick-set and fat, dressed like
   the cotton-spinners whom I once saw near the frontiers of the three
   kings. I saw these people hurrying to worship their idols. The Holy
   Family went into a shed; there were beasts in it, but these went out to
   make room for them. Their provisions had given out, and they had
   neither bread nor water. Nobody gave them anything, and Mary was hardly
   able to feed her Child. They did, indeed, endure every human misery. At
   last some shepherds came to water the beasts at a closed spring, and at
   Joseph's urgent request gave them a little water. Then I saw the Holy
   Family going through a wood, exhausted and helpless. On coming out of
   it they saw a tall, slender date palm with its fruit growing all
   together like a bunch of grapes at the very top of the tree. Mary went
   up to the tree with the Infant Jesus in her arms, and prayed, lifting
   the Child up to it; the tree bowed down its head to them, as if it were
   kneeling, so that they were able to pick all its fruit. [162] The tree
   remained in that position. I saw a rabble of people from the last town
   following the Holy Family, and I saw Mary distributing the fruit from
   the tree among the many naked children who were running after her.
   About a quarter of an hour from the first tree they came to an
   unusually big sycamore tree with a hollow trunk. They had got out of
   sight of the people who were following them, and hid in the tree so as
   to let them pass by. They spent the night here.

20. THE DESERT. A SPRING ARISES FROM MARY'S PRAYER.

   Next day they continued through waste and sandy deserts, and I saw them
   sitting on a sand-hill quite exhausted, for they had no water with
   them. The Blessed Virgin prayed to God, and I saw an abundant spring of
   water gush forth at her side and run in streams on the ground. Joseph
   leveled a little sand-hill and made a basin for the water, digging a
   little channel to carry off the overflow. They refreshed themselves
   with the water and Mary washed the Infant Jesus. Joseph watered the
   donkey and filled the water-skin. I saw tortoises, and ugly creatures
   like big lizards coming to drink at the water. They did the Holy Family
   no harm, but looked at them in a friendly way. The stream of water
   flowed in a wide circle, disappearing again in the ground near its
   source. The space which it enclosed was wonderfully blessed: it soon
   became green and produced the most delicious balsam shrubs, which grew
   big enough to give refreshment to the Holy Family on their return from
   Egypt. Later it became famous as a balsam garden. A number of people
   came to settle there; amongst them, I think, the mother of the leprous
   child who had been healed in the robbers' den. Later I had visions of
   this place. A beautiful hedge of balsam shrubs surrounded the garden,
   in the middle of which were big fruit trees. Later a deep well was dug
   there, from which an abundant supply of water was drawn by a wheel
   turned by an ox. This water was mixed with the water from Mary's well
   so as to supply the whole garden. The water from the new well would
   have been harmful if used unmixed. It was shown me that the oxen who
   turned the wheel did no work from midday on Saturday till Monday
   morning.

21. HELIOPOLIS, OR ON.

   After refreshing themselves here they journeyed to a great city called
   Heliopolis or On. It had wonderful buildings, but much of it had been
   laid waste. When the children of Israel were in Egypt, the Egyptian
   priest Potiphera lived here, and had in his house Asenath (the daughter
   of Dinah of the Shechemites) whom Joseph married. [163] Here also
   Dionysius the Areopagite lived at the time of Christ's death. The city
   had been devastated by war, but numbers of people had made themselves
   homes in the ruined buildings.

   The Holy Family crossed a very high bridge over a broad river which
   seemed to me to have several arms. They came to an open place in front
   of the city-gate, which was surrounded by a kind of promenade. Here
   there was a pedestal, thicker below than above, surmounted by a great
   idol with an ox's head bearing in its arms something like a child in
   swaddling-bands. The idol was surrounded by a circle of stones like
   benches or tables, and people came in crowds from the city to lay their
   offerings on them. Not far from this idol was a great tree under which
   the Holy Family sat down to rest. They had rested there for only a
   short time when there came an earthquake, and the idol swayed and fell
   to the ground. [164] There was an uproar among the people, and a crowd
   of canal-workers ran up from near at hand. A good man who had
   accompanied the Holy Family on their way here (I think he was a
   drain-digger) led them hurriedly into the town, and they were leaving
   the place where the idol had stood when the frightened crowd observed
   them and began assailing them with threats and abuse for having been
   the cause of the idol's collapse. They had not, however, time to carry
   out their threats, for another shock came which uprooted and engulfed
   the great tree till nothing but its roots showed above ground. The
   gaping space where the idol had stood became full of dark and dirty
   water, in which the whole idol disappeared except for its horns. Some
   of the most evil among the raging mob were swallowed up in this dark
   pool. Meanwhile the Holy Family went quietly into the city, and took up
   their abode near a great heathen temple in the thickness of a wall,
   where there were a great number of empty rooms.

   [Catherine Emmerich also communicated the following fragments of
   visions of the subsequent life of the Holy Family in Heliopolis or On:]

   Once at a later time I came over the sea to Egypt, and found the Holy
   Family still living in the great devastated city. It is very extensive,
   and is built beside a great river with many arms. The city can be seen
   from afar, standing high up. In many places the river flows underneath
   the buildings. The people cross the arms of the river on rafts which
   lie there in the water ready for use. I saw quite astonishingly huge
   buildings in ruins, great masses of solid masonry, halves of towers,
   and whole, or nearly whole, temples. I saw pillars as big as towers,
   with winding staircases outside. I saw high tapering pillars completely
   covered with strange figures, and also a number of big figures like
   reclining dogs with human heads.

   The Holy Family lived in the galleries of a great stone building
   supported at one side by short thick pillars, some square, and some
   round. People had built themselves dwellings against and under these
   pillars; above the building ran a road with much traffic on it; it
   passed a great heathen temple with two courts. In this building was a
   space with a wall on one side of it and on the other a row of short
   thick pillars. In front of this Joseph had constructed a light wooden
   building, divided off by wooden partitions, for them to live in. I saw
   them there all together. The donkeys were there, too, but separated by
   screens such as Joseph always used to make. I noticed for the first
   time that they had a little altar against the wall, hidden behind one
   of these screens--a little table covered with a red cloth and a
   transparent white one over it. There was a lamp above it, and they used
   to pray there. Later I saw that Joseph had arranged a workshop in his
   home, and also that he often went out to work. He made long staffs with
   knobs at the end, and little low round three-legged stools with a
   handle at the back to carry them by. He also made baskets and light
   wicker screens. These were afterwards smeared with some substance which
   made them solid, and were then used to make huts and compartments
   against and in the massive masonry of the walls. He also made little
   light hexagonal or octagonal towers out of long thin planks, ending in
   a point crowned by a knob. These had an opening and could be used to
   sit in like sentry-boxes. They had steps leading up to them. I saw
   little towers like these here and there in front of the heathen
   temples, and also on the flat roofs. People sat inside them. They were
   perhaps sentry-boxes, or little summer-houses used to give shade.

   I saw the Blessed Virgin weaving carpets. I also saw her with other
   work; she had a stick beside her with a lump fastened to the top of it,
   but I do not know what she was doing, whether spinning or something
   else. I often saw people visiting her and the Infant Jesus, who lay in
   a sort of cradle on the floor beside her. Sometimes I saw this cradle
   raised on a stand like a sawing-trestle. I saw the Child lying very
   contentedly in His cradle, sometimes with His arms hanging out on each
   side. Once I saw Him sitting up in it. Mary sat close by knitting, with
   a basket at her side. There were three women with her.

   The people in this half-destroyed city were dressed just like those
   cotton-spinning people whom I saw when I went to meet the three kings,
   except that they wore aprons, like short skirts. There were not many
   Jews here, and they seemed to live here on sufferance. North of
   Heliopolis, between it and the Nile, which there divides into many
   arms, was the land of Gessen. Amongst its canals was a place where a
   large number of Jews lived. Their religion had become very degraded.
   Some of these Jews became acquainted with the Holy Family, and Mary
   made various things for them, in return for which they gave her bread
   and provisions. The Jews in the land of Gessen had a temple which they
   likened to Solomon's temple, but it was very different. [165]

22. HELIOPOLIS, ON. JOSEPH BUILDS A PLACE FOR JEWISH PRAYER.

   I again saw the Holy Family in Heliopolis. They were still living near
   the heathen temple under the vaulting of the massive walls. Not far off
   Joseph built a place of prayer in which the Jews living in the city
   assembled together with the Holy Family. Before this they had had no
   meeting-place for prayer. The room had a lightly built dome above it,
   which they could open so as to be under the open sky. In the middle of
   the room stood a sacrificial table or altar, covered with white and
   red, and having scrolls upon it. The priest or teacher was a very old
   man. The men and women were not so strictly separated at their prayers
   as in the Promised Land: the men stood on one side and the women on the
   other. I had a sight of the Blessed Virgin visiting this place of
   prayer with the Infant Jesus for the first time. She sat on the ground
   leaning on one arm; the Child was sitting before her in a little
   sky-blue dress, and she put His hands together on His breast. Joseph
   stood behind her, as he always does here, though the other men and
   women stand and sit in separate groups on each side of the room. I was
   often shown how the little Jesus was already growing bigger, and how He
   was often visited by other children. He could already speak and run
   quite well; He was much with Joseph, and I think went with him when he
   worked away from home. He wore a little dress like a shirt, knitted or
   woven in one piece. Some of the idols fell down in the temple near
   which they lived, just as the statue near the gate had collapsed on
   their entry into the city; many people said that this was a sign of the
   wrath of the gods against the Holy Family, and in consequence they
   suffered various persecutions.

23. THE MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS.

   Towards the middle of Jesus' second year the Blessed Virgin was told of
   Herod's Massacre of the Innocents by an angel appearing to her in
   Heliopolis. She and Joseph were greatly distressed, and the Child Jesus
   wept that whole day. I saw what follows.

   When the three kings did not return to Jerusalem, Herod's anxiety
   decreased to some extent; he was at that time much occupied with family
   affairs. His anxiety revived again, however, when various reports
   reached him about Simeon's and Anna's prophecies in the Temple at the
   Presentation of the Infant Jesus. At this moment the Holy Family had
   been some time in Nazareth.

   Under various pretexts he dispatched soldiers to different places round
   Jerusalem, such as Gilgal, Bethlehem, and Hebron, and ordered a census
   of the children to be made. The soldiers remained, I think, about nine
   months in these places. Herod was in the meantime in Rome, [166] and it
   was not until soon after his return that the children were massacred.
   John the Baptist was two years old when it happened, and had again been
   for some time at home with his parents in secret. Before Herod issued
   the order that all mothers were to bring before the authorities their
   male children up to two years old, Elizabeth had been warned by the
   appearance of an angel and had once more fled into the wilderness with
   her little son. Jesus was nearly eighteen months old and could already
   run about. [167] The children were massacred in seven different places.
   The mothers had been promised rewards for their fruitfulness. They came
   from their homes in the surrounding country to the government offices
   in the various towns, bringing with them their little boys in holiday
   dress. The husbands were turned back, and the mothers were separated
   from their children. These were stabbed by the soldiers behind the
   walls of lonely courtyards; their bodies were heaped together and then
   buried in trenches.

   [Catherine Emmerich communicated her vision of the Massacre of the
   Innocents on March 8 ^th, 1821, i.e. a year after her account of the
   Flight into Egypt, so that it may be presumed that the massacre took
   place a year later than the Flight.]

   This afternoon I saw the mothers with their little sons up to two years
   of age come to Jerusalem from Hebron, Bethlehem, and a third place.
   Herod had sent soldiers there, and had later communicated his orders
   through the authorities of these towns. The women came to the city in
   separate groups. Some had two children with them and rode on donkeys.
   They came to the city in joyful expectation, for they thought they were
   to receive a reward for their fruitfulness. They were all taken into a
   large building, and the men accompanying them were sent home. This
   building was somewhat isolated; it was not far from the house where
   later Pilate lived. It was so enclosed that it was difficult to see
   from outside what was happening within it. It must once have been a
   place of execution, for I saw in its courtyard stone pillars and blocks
   with chains fastened to them, as well as trees which were tied together
   and then allowed to spring apart so as to tear in pieces the men
   fastened to them. It was a dark, strong building, and its courtyard was
   quite as big as the graveyard on one side of Dülmen parish church. A
   gate led through two walls into this courtyard, which was enclosed by
   buildings on three sides. To the right and left these were one story
   high; the center one had two stories and looked like an ancient
   deserted synagogue. There were gates opening into the courtyard from
   all three buildings.

   The mothers were led through the courtyard into the two side-buildings
   and there imprisoned. At first I had the impression of their being in a
   kind of hospice or inn. They became alarmed when they saw themselves
   deprived of liberty and began to weep and moan, continuing their
   laments throughout the whole night.

   [On the next day, March 9 ^th, she said:] This afternoon I saw a
   terrible picture. I saw the Massacre of the Innocents taking place in
   that house of execution. The big building at the back of the court was
   two stories high: the lower story consisted of a great deserted hall
   like a prison or a guard-room; above it was a large room with windows
   looking down into the courtyard. I saw a number of officials assembled
   there as if in a court of justice; before them was a table on which lay
   scrolls. I think Herod was there, too, for I saw a man in a red cloak
   lined with white fur with little black tails on it. He was wearing a
   crown. I saw him, surrounded by others, looking out of the window of
   the room.

   The mothers were summoned one by one with their children from the
   side-buildings into the great hall below the building at the back of
   the courtyard. As they came in, their children were removed from them
   by soldiers and taken through the gate into the courtyard, where some
   twenty soldiers were at the murderous work of thrusting swords and
   spears into their throats and hearts. Some were children still at the
   breast, wrapped in swaddling-bands; others were tiny boys wearing long
   embroidered dresses. They did not trouble to take off their clothes,
   they ran their swords through their throats and hearts, and then seized
   their bodies by an arm or leg and flung them onto a heap. It was a
   ghastly sight. The mothers were thrust back one by one by the soldiers
   into the great hall. When they saw what was done to their children,
   they raised a terrible outcry, clinging to each other and tearing their
   hair. They were so closely packed at the end that they could hardly
   move. I think the massacre went on until towards evening.

   The children's bodies were afterwards buried in a pit in the same
   courtyard. Their number was shown to me, but I have no clear
   recollection of it. I think it was 700, and another number with 7 or 17
   in it. The number was explained to me by an expression in which I
   remember a sound like Ducen': I think I had to reckon two c's together
   several times. [168]

   I was absolutely horrified by what I had seen, and did not know where
   it had happened: I thought it was here. It was only when I woke up that
   I was able gradually to recollect myself. The next night I saw the
   mothers being taken back by the soldiers to their homes, bound, and in
   separate groups. The place of the Massacre of the Innocents in
   Jerusalem was used later as a court of justice; it was not far from
   Pilate's judgment seat, but by his time it had been a good deal
   altered. At Christ's death I saw the grave of the massacred children
   fall in and saw their souls appear and depart from thence.

24. THE BOY JOHN ESCAPES AGAIN TO THE WILDERNESS.

   I was shown how Elizabeth, warned by the angel, once more fled into the
   desert with the little John to escape the Massacre of the Innocents.

   Elizabeth searched for a long time till she found a cave which seemed
   to her sufficiently hidden, and then stayed there with the boy for
   about forty days. When she went home, an Essene from the community on
   Mount Horeb came to the boy in the wilderness, brought him food, and
   gave him all the help he needed. This Essene (whose name I keep
   forgetting) was a relation of Anna of the Temple. He came at first
   every eight days, then every fourteen; but in a short time John no
   longer needed help, for he was soon more at home in the wilderness than
   among men. It was ordained by God that he should grow up in the
   wilderness without contact with mankind and innocent of their sins.
   Like Jesus, he never went to school; the Holy Ghost taught him in the
   wilderness. I often saw at his side a light, or shining figures like
   angels. The desert here was not waste and barren; many plants and
   bushes grew in it, bearing many kinds of berries, and among the rocks
   were strawberries, which John picked and ate as he passed. He was
   uncommonly familiar with the beasts, and especially with the birds:
   they flew to him and perched on his shoulders, he spoke to them and
   they seemed to understand him and to act as his messengers. He wandered
   along the banks of the streams, and was just as familiar with the
   fishes. They swam near to him when he called them, and followed him in
   the water as he went along the bank.

   I saw now that he moved far away from his home, perhaps because of the
   danger which threatened him. He was so friendly with the beasts that
   they helped him and warned him. They led him to their nests and lairs,
   and he fled with them into their hiding-holes if men came near. He
   lived upon fruit, berries, roots, and herbs. He had no need to search
   long for them; he either knew himself where they grew, or the beasts
   showed him. He always had his sheepskin and his little staff, and from
   time to time went still deeper into the wilderness. Sometimes he would
   go nearer his home. Several times he rejoined his parents, who were
   always longing for him. I think they must have known about each other
   by revelation, for whenever Elizabeth and Zechariah wanted to see him,
   he always came from a long way off to meet them.

25. TRAIN TO MATAREA. AN IDOL FALLS AT THE FAMILY'S PASSING.

   After staying in Heliopolis for a year and a half, until Jesus was
   about two years old, the Holy Family left the city because of lack of
   work and various persecutions. They moved southwards in the direction
   of Memphis. When they passed through a small town not far from
   Heliopolis and sat down to rest in the open porch of a heathen temple,
   the idol fell down and broke in pieces. (It had the head of an ox with
   three horns, and there were holes in its body in which sacrifices were
   placed to be burnt.) This caused an uproar amongst the heathen priests,
   who seized and threatened the Holy Family. As the priests were
   consulting together, one of them said that for his part he thought it
   wise to commend themselves to the God of these people, reminding them
   of the plagues that had befallen their ancestors when they persecuted
   the Israelites, and how in the night before their exodus the firstborn
   had died in every Egyptian house. They followed his advice and
   dismissed the Holy Family unmolested.

   They made their way to Troja, a place on the east bank of the Nile,
   opposite Memphis. It was a big town, but filthy. They thought of
   staying here, but were not taken in; indeed, they could not even obtain
   the drink of water or the few dates for which they asked. Memphis was
   on the west bank of the Nile, which was here very broad, with islands.
   Part of the city was on the east bank, and here in the time of Pharaoh
   was a great palace with gardens and a high tower, to the top of which
   Pharaoh's daughter used often to ascend to survey the country round. I
   saw the place where the child Moses was found among the tall rushes.
   Memphis was composed as it were of three different towns, one on each
   side of the Nile, and another called Babylon which seemed to belong to
   it. This was farther downstream on the east bank. Indeed, in Pharaoh's
   time the whole region round the Nile between Heliopolis, Babylon, and
   Memphis was so covered with canals, buildings, and stone embankments
   that it all seemed to form one uninterrupted city. Now, at the time of
   the Holy Family's visit, it had all become separated with great waste
   spaces between. From Troja they went northwards down-stream towards
   Babylon, which was ill-built, dirty, and desolate. They skirted this
   city between it and the Nile, and retraced their steps for some
   distance. They went down-stream, following an embankment along which
   Jesus traveled later, when He journeyed through Arabia to Egypt after
   the raising of Lazarus before meeting His disciples again at Jacob's
   Well at Sychar. They traveled down-stream for some two hours; there
   were ruined buildings at intervals all along their path. They had to
   cross a small arm of the river or canal, and came to a place whose name
   as it was at that time I cannot remember; afterwards it was called
   Matarea, and was near Heliopolis. [169] This place, which lay on a
   promontory surrounded by water on two sides, was very desolate. Its
   scattered buildings were mostly very badly made of palm wood and thick
   mud, roofed with reeds. Joseph found much work here in strengthening
   the houses with wattles and building galleries onto them.

   In this town the Holy Family lived in a dark vaulted room in a lonely
   quarter at the landward side of the town, not far from the gate by
   which they had entered. As before, Joseph built a room in front of the
   vaulted one. Here, too, when they arrived, an idol fell down in a small
   temple, and afterwards all the idols fell. Here, too, a priest pacified
   the people by reminding them of the plagues of Egypt. Later, when a
   little congregation of Jews and converted heathen had gathered round
   the Holy Family, the priests handed over to them the little temple
   where the idol had fallen, and Joseph arranged it as a synagogue. He
   became, as it were, the father of the congregation, and introduced the
   proper singing of the psalms, for their previous services had been very
   disorderly. There were only a few very poor Jews living here in
   wretched holes and ditches, though in the Jewish town between On and
   the Nile there were many Jews and they had a regular temple there. They
   had, however, fallen into dreadful idolatry; they had a golden calf, a
   figure with an ox's head surrounded by little figures of animals like
   pole-cats or ferrets with little canopies over them. These were animals
   which protected people against crocodiles. They also had an imitation
   Ark of the Covenant, with horrible things in it. They carried on a
   revolting idolatrous worship, which consisted of immoral practices
   performed in a subterranean passage and supposed to bring about the
   coming of the Messiah. They were very obstinate and refused to amend
   their lives. Afterwards many of them left this place and came to where
   the Holy Family lived, not more than two hours' journey away. Owing to
   the many dykes and canals, they could not travel direct but had to make
   a detour round On.

   The Jews in the land of Gessen had already become acquainted with the
   Holy Family in the city of On, and Mary had done much work for them
   knitting, weaving, and sewing. She would never work at things which
   were superfluous or mere luxuries, only at what was necessary and at
   praying garments. I saw women bringing her work to do which they
   wanted, from vanity, to be made in a fashionable style; and I saw Mary
   giving back the work, however much she needed the money. I saw, too,
   that the women insulted her vilely.

26. MATAREA AND ITS POVERTY.

   To begin with, they had a very hard time in Matarea. There was great
   shortage of good water and wood. The inhabitants cooked with dry grass
   or reeds. The Holy Family generally had cold food to eat. Joseph was
   given a great deal of work in improving the huts, but the people there
   treated him just like a slave, giving him only what they liked;
   sometimes he brought home some money for his work, sometimes none. The
   inhabitants were very clumsy at building their huts. Wood was lacking,
   and though I saw trunks of trees lying about here and there, I noticed
   that there were no tools for dealing with them. Most of the people had
   nothing but stone and bone knives like turf-cutters. Joseph had brought
   his necessary tools with him. The Holy Family soon arranged their
   dwelling a little. Joseph divided the room very conveniently by light
   wicker screens; he prepared a proper fireplace and made stools and
   little low tables. The people here all ate off the ground.

   They lived here for several years, and I have seen many scenes from
   Jesus' childhood. I saw where Jesus slept. In the thickness of the wall
   of Mary's sleeping-room I saw a niche hollowed out by Joseph in which
   was Jesus' couch. Mary slept beside it, and I have often seen her
   during the night kneeling before Jesus' couch and praying to God.
   Joseph slept in another room.

   I also saw a praying-place which Joseph had arranged in their dwelling.
   It was in a separate passage. Joseph and the Blessed Virgin had their
   own special places, and the Child Jesus also had His own little corner,
   where He prayed sitting, standing, or kneeling. The Blessed Virgin had
   a kind of little altar before which she prayed. A little table, covered
   with red and white, was let down like a flap before a cupboard in the
   wall, of which it generally formed the door. In the thickness of the
   wall were preserved sacred relics. I saw little bushy plants in pots
   shaped like chalices. I saw the end of St. Joseph's staff with its
   blossom, whereby the lot had fallen upon him in the Temple to become
   Mary's spouse. It was fixed in a box an inch and a half in thickness.
   Besides this, I saw another precious relic, but can no longer explain
   what it really was. In a transparent box I saw five little white sticks
   of the thickness of big straws. They stood crossed and as if tied in
   the middle; at the top they were curly and broader, like a little
   sheaf. [She crossed her fingers to explain and spoke also of bread.]

27. ELIZABETH TAKES THE BOY JOHN AGAIN TO THE WILDERNESS.

   During the sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt the child John must have
   again stayed in secret with his parents at Juttah, for I saw him at the
   age of four or five being once more taken into the wilderness by
   Elizabeth. When they left the house, Zechariah was not there; I think
   he had gone away beforehand so as not to see the departure, for he
   loved John beyond measure. He had, however, given him his blessing, for
   each time he went away he used to bless Elizabeth and John.

   Little John had a sheepskin hanging over his left shoulder round his
   breast and back, fastened together under his right arm. Afterwards in
   the desert I saw him wearing this sheepskin sometimes over both
   shoulders, sometimes across his breast, sometimes round his waist--just
   as it suited him. This sheepskin was all that the boy wore. He had
   brownish hair darker than Jesus', and he still carried in his hand the
   little white staff which he had brought from home before. I always saw
   him with it in the wilderness.

   I now saw him hurrying along hand in hand with his mother Elizabeth, a
   tall woman with a small face and delicate features. She was much
   wrapped up and walked quickly. The child often ran on ahead; he was
   quite natural and childlike, but not thoughtless. At first their way
   led them northwards for some time, and they had water on their right
   hand; then I saw them crossing a little stream. There was no bridge,
   and they crossed on logs lying in the water, which Elizabeth, who was a
   very resolute woman, ferried across with a branch. After crossing the
   stream they turned more eastwards and entered a rocky ravine, the upper
   part of which was waste and stony, though the lower slopes were thick
   with bushes and fruits, among them many strawberries, of which the boy
   ate one here and there.

   After they had gone some way into this ravine, Elizabeth said good-bye
   to the boy. She blessed him, pressed him to her heart, kissed him on
   his forehead and on both cheeks, and started on her journey home. She
   turned round several times on her way, and wept as she looked back
   towards John. The boy himself was quite untroubled and wandered on
   farther into the ravine with sure steps.

   As during these visions I was very ill, God granted me the favor of
   feeling as if I were myself a child in presence of all that happened.
   It seemed to me that I was a child of John's own age, accompanying him
   on his way; and I was afraid that he would go too far from his mother
   and would never find his way borne again. Soon, however, I was
   reassured by a voice which said: Do not be troubled. The boy well knows
   what he is about.' Then I thought that I went quite alone with him into
   the wilderness as if he had been a familiar childhood's playmate of
   mine, and I saw many of the things that happened to him. Yes, while we
   were together, John himself told me much about his life in the
   wilderness. For example, how he practiced self-denial in every way and
   mortified his senses, how his vision grew ever brighter and clearer,
   and how he had been taught in an indescribable way, by everything round
   him.

   All this did not astonish me, for long ago as a child, when I was all
   by myself watching our cows, I used to live in familiar fellowship with
   John in the wilderness. I often longed to see him, and used then to
   call into the bushes in my country dialect: Little John with his little
   stick and his sheepskin on his shoulder is to come to me.' And often,
   little John with his little stick and his sheepskin on his shoulder did
   come to me, and we two children played together. He told me and taught
   me all kinds of good things, and it never seemed to me strange that in
   the wilderness he learnt so much from plants and beasts. For when I was
   a child, whether in the woods, on the moors, in the fields, with the
   cows, plucking ears of corn, pulling grass, or gathering herbs, I used
   to look at every little leaf and every flower as at a book. Every bird,
   every beast that ran past me, everything around me, taught me
   something. Every shape and color that I saw, every little veined leaf,
   filled my mind with many deep thoughts. But if I spoke of these, people
   either listened with surprise or else, more often, laughed at me, so
   that at last I accustomed myself to keeping silence about such things.
   I used to think (and sometimes think still) that it must be so with
   everyone, and that nowhere could one learn better, because here God
   Himself had written our alphabet for us.

   So now, when I followed again in my visions the boy John into the
   wilderness, I saw, as before, all that he was about. I saw him playing
   with flowers and beasts. The birds especially were at home with him.
   They flew onto his head as he walked or as he knelt in prayer. I often
   saw him lay his staff across the branches; then at his call flocks of
   bright-colored birds came flying to perch on it in a row. He gazed at
   them and spoke familiarly with them as if they were his schoolchildren.
   I saw him, too, following wild animals into their lairs, feeding them
   and watching them attentively.

28. HEROD HAS ZECHARIAH CAPTURED, QUESTIONED, AND KILLED. ELIZABETH DIES.

   When John was about six years old, Elizabeth took the opportunity of
   Zechariah's absence on a journey to the Temple with herds for sacrifice
   to pay a visit to her son in the wilderness. Zechariah, I think, never
   went to see him there, so that he might truthfully say, if asked by
   Herod where his son was, that he did not know. In order, however, to
   satisfy his intense longing to see John, the latter came several times
   from the wilderness to his parents house in great secrecy and by night,
   and stayed there a short time. Probably his guardian angel led him
   there at the right moment when there was no danger. I saw him always
   guided and protected by higher Powers, and sometimes accompanied by
   shining figures like angels.

   John was destined to live in the wilderness, separated from the world
   and from ordinary human food, and to be taught and trained by the
   Spirit of God. Providence so ordained matters that outer circumstances
   made him take refuge in the desert to which his natural instincts drew
   him with irresistible force; from his earliest childhood I always saw
   him thoughtful and solitary, just as the Child Jesus fled to Egypt as
   the result of a divine warning, so did John, His precursor, fly to a
   hiding place in the wilderness. Suspicion was directed to him, too, for
   there had been much talk in the land about John ever since his early
   days. It was well known that wonders had attended his birth, and that
   he was often seen surrounded by light, for which reasons Herod was
   particularly suspicious of him. He had caused Zechariah to be
   questioned several times as to the whereabouts of John, but had never
   yet laid hands on the old man. This time, however, as he was on his way
   to the Temple, he was attacked by Herod's soldiers in a sunken road
   outside the Bethlehem Gate of Jerusalem, from which the city was not
   yet visible. These soldiers, who had been lying in wait for him,
   dragged him brutally to a prison on the slope of the Hill of Sion,
   where later I used often to see Jesus' disciples making their way up to
   the Temple. The old man was here subjected to ill-treatment and even
   torture, in order to force from him a confession of his son's
   whereabouts. When this had no effect, he was, by Herod's soldiers,
   stabbed to death. [170] His friends buried his body not far from the
   Temple. This was not the Zechariah who was murdered between the Temple
   and the altar. When the dead came out of their graves at the death of
   Christ, I saw the grave of that Zechariah falling out of the Temple
   walls near the praying-room of the aged Simeon, and himself coming
   forth from it. At that moment several other secret graves in the Temple
   burst open. On the occasion when that Zechariah was murdered between
   the Temple and the altar, there were many disputes going on about the
   descent of the Messiah, and about certain rights and privileges in the
   Temple of various families. For instance, not all families were allowed
   to have their children brought up in the Temple. (This reminds me that
   I once saw in the care of Anna in the Temple a boy whose name I have
   forgotten; I think he was a king's son.) Zechariah was the only one
   among the disputants who was murdered. His father was called Barachiah.
   [171] I saw that later the bones of that Zechariah were found again,
   but have forgotten the details.

   Elizabeth came home from the desert expecting to find Zechariah
   returned from Jerusalem. John accompanied her for some of the way; when
   they parted, she blessed him and kissed him on the forehead, and he
   hastened back, untroubled, to the wilderness. On reaching home
   Elizabeth heard the terrible news of the murder of Zechariah. She
   grieved and lamented so sorely that she could find no peace or rest at
   home, and so left Juttah for ever and hastened to join John in the
   wilderness. She died there not long after, before the return of the
   Holy Family from Egypt. She was buried in the wilderness by the Essene
   from Mount Horeb who had always helped little John.

   After this John moved farther into the wilderness. He left the rocky
   ravine for more open country, and I saw him arrive at a small lake in
   the desert. The shore was flat and covered with white sand, and I saw
   him go far out into the water and all the fishes swimming fearlessly up
   to him. He was quite at home with them. He lived here for some time,
   and I saw that he had made himself in the bushes a sleeping-hut of
   branches. It was quite low, and only just big enough for him to lie
   down in. Here and later I saw him accompanied very often by shining
   figures or angels, with whom he associated humbly and devoutly, but
   unafraid and in childlike confidence. They seemed to teach him and to
   make him notice all kinds of things. I saw that his staff had a little
   cross-piece, so that it formed a cross; fastened to it was a broad band
   of bark which he waved about in play like a little flag.

   A daughter of Elizabeth's sister now lived in John's family house at
   Juttah near Hebron. It was well supplied with everything. When John was
   grown-up he came there once in secret, and then went still farther into
   the wilderness, remaining there until he appeared among mankind. Of
   this I shall tell later.

29. MATAREA. THE HOLY VIRGIN DISCOVERS A SPRING NEAR THEIR HOUSE.

   In Matarea, where the inhabitants had to quench their thirst with the
   muddy water of the Nile, a fountain sprang up as before in answer to
   Mary's prayers. At first they suffered great want, and were obliged to
   live on fruit and bad water. It was long since they had had any good
   water, and Joseph was making ready to take his water-skins on the
   donkey to fetch water from the balsam spring in the desert, when in
   answer to her prayer an angel appeared to the Blessed Virgin and told
   her to look for a spring behind their house. I saw her go beyond the
   enclosure round their dwelling to an open space on a lower level
   surrounded by broken-down embankments. A very big old tree stood here.
   the Blessed Virgin had a stick in her hand with a little shovel at the
   end of it, such as people in that country often carried on their
   journeys. She thrust this into the ground near the tree, and thereupon
   a beautiful clear stream of water gushed forth.

   She ran joyfully to call Joseph, who on digging out the spring
   discovered that it had been lined with masonry below, but had dried up
   and was choked with rubbish. Joseph repaired and cleaned it, and
   surrounded it with beautiful new stonework. Near this spring, on the
   side from which Mary had approached it, was a big stone, just like an
   altar, and, indeed, I think it had once been an altar, but I forget in
   what connection. Here the Blessed Virgin used to dry Jesus' clothes and
   wrappings in the sun after washing them. This spring remained unknown
   and was used only by the Holy Family until Jesus was big enough to do
   various little commissions, such as fetching water for His Mother. I
   once saw that He brought other children to the spring, and made a cup
   with a leaf for them to drink from. The children told this to their
   parents, so others came to the spring, but, as a rule, it was used only
   by the Jews. I saw Jesus fetching water for His Mother for the first
   time. Mary was in her room kneeling in prayer, and Jesus crept out to
   the spring with a skin and fetched water; that was the first time. Mary
   was inexpressibly touched when she saw Him coming back, and begged Him
   not to do it again, in case He were to fall into the water. Jesus said
   that He would be very careful and that He wanted to fetch water for her
   whenever she needed it.

   The Child Jesus performed all kinds of services for His parents with
   great attention and thoughtfulness. Thus I saw Him, when Joseph was
   working near his home, running to fetch some tool which had been left
   behind. He paid attention to everything. I am sure that the joy He gave
   His parents must have outweighed all their sufferings. I also saw Jesus
   going sometimes to the Jewish settlement, about a mile from Matarea. to
   fetch bread in return for His Mother's work. The many loathsome beasts
   to be found in this country did Him no harm; on the contrary, they were
   very friendly with Him. I have seen Him playing with snakes.

   The first time that He went alone to the Jewish settlement (I am not
   sure whether it was in His fifth or seventh year) He was wearing a new
   brown dress with yellow flowers round its edge which the Blessed Virgin
   had made and embroidered for Him. He knelt down to pray on the way, and
   I saw two angels appearing to Him and announcing the death of Herod the
   Great. Jesus said nothing of this to His parents, why I do not know,
   whether from humility or because the angel had forbidden Him to, or
   because He knew that the time had not yet come for them to leave Egypt.
   Once I saw Him going to the settlement with other Jewish children, and
   when He returned home, I saw Him weeping bitterly over the degraded
   state of the Jews living there.

  29.1 THE SPRING AT MATAREA - DISCOVERED BY JOB.

   The spring which appeared at Matarea in answer to the Blessed Virgin's
   prayers was not a new one, but an old one which gushed forth afresh. It
   had been choked but was still lined with masonry. I saw that Job had
   been in Egypt long before Abraham and had dwelt on this spot in this
   place. [172] It was he who found the spring, and he made sacrifices on
   the great stone lying here. Job was the youngest of thirteen brothers.
   His father was a great chieftain at the time of the building of the
   Tower of Babel. His father had one brother who was Abraham's ancestor.
   The tribes of these two brothers generally intermarried. Job's first
   wife was of the tribe of Peleg: after many adventures, when he was
   living in his third home, he married three more wives of the same
   tribe. One of them bore him a son whose daughter married into the tribe
   of Peleg and gave birth to Abraham's mother. Job was thus the
   great-grandfather of Abraham's mother. Job's father was called Joktan,
   a son of Eber. He lived to the north of the Caspian Sea, near a
   mountain range one side of which is quite warm, while the other is cold
   and ice-covered. There were elephants in that country. I do not think
   elephants could have gone to the place where Job first went to set up
   his own tribe, for it was very swampy there. That place was to the
   north of a mountain range lying between two seas, the westernmost of
   which was before the Flood a high mountain inhabited by evil angels by
   whom men were possessed. [173] The country there was poor and marshy; I
   think it is now inhabited by a race with small eyes, flat noses, and
   high cheek-bones. It was here that Job's first misfortune befell him,
   and he then moved southwards to the Caucasus and began his life again.
   From here he made a great expedition to Egypt, a land which at that
   time was ruled by foreign kings belonging to a shepherd people from
   Job's fatherland. One of these came from Job's own country; another
   came from the farthest country of the three holy kings. They ruled over
   only a part of Egypt, and were later driven out by an Egyptian king.
   [174] At one time there was a great number of these shepherd people all
   collected together in one city; they had migrated to Egypt from their
   own country.

   The king of these shepherds from Job's country desired a wife for his
   son from his family's tribe in the Caucasus, and Job brought this royal
   bride (who was related to him) to Egypt with a great following. He had
   thirty camels with him, and many menservants and rich presents. He was
   still young--a tall man of a pleasing yellow-brown color, with reddish
   hair. The people in Egypt were dirty brown in color. At that time Egypt
   was not thickly populated; only here and there were large masses of
   people. There were no great buildings either; these did not appear
   until the time of the children of Israel.

   The king showed Job great honor, and was unwilling to let him go away
   again. He was very anxious for him to emigrate to Egypt with his whole
   tribe, and appointed as his dwelling-place the city where afterwards
   the Holy Family lived, which was then quite different. Job remained
   five years in Egypt, and I saw that he lived in the same place where
   the Holy Family lived, and that God showed him that spring. When
   performing his religious ceremonies, he made sacrifice on the great
   stone.

   Job was to be sure a heathen, but he was an upright man who
   acknowledged the true God and worshipped Him as the Creator of all that
   he saw in nature, the stars, and the ever-changing light. He was never
   tired of speaking with God of His wonderful creations. He worshipped
   none of the horrible figures of beasts adored by the other races of
   mankind in his time, but had thought out for himself a representation
   of the true God. This was a small figure of a man with rays round its
   head, and I think it had wings. Its hands were clasped under its
   breast, and bore a globe on which was a ship on waves. Perhaps it was
   meant to represent the Flood. When performing his religious ceremonies
   he burnt grains before this little figure. Figures of this kind were
   afterwards introduced into Egypt, sitting in a kind of pulpit with a
   canopy above.

   Job found a terrible form of idolatry here in this city, descending
   from the heathen magical rites practiced at the building of the Tower
   of Babel. They had an idol with a broad ox's head, rising to a point at
   the top. Its mouth was open, and behind its head were twisted horns.
   Its body was hollow, fire was made in it, and live children were thrust
   into its glowing arms. I saw something being taken out of holes in its
   body. The people here were horrible, and the land was full of dreadful
   beasts. Great black creatures with fiery manes flew about in swarms,
   scattering what seemed like fire as they flew. They poisoned everything
   in their path, and the trees withered away under them. I saw other
   animals with long hind-legs and short fore-legs, like moles; they could
   leap from roof to roof. Then there were frightful creatures lurking in
   hollows and between stones, which wound themselves round men and
   strangled them. In the Nile I saw a heavy, awkward beast with hideous
   teeth and thick black feet. It was the size of a horse and had
   something pig-like about it. Besides these I saw many other ugly
   creatures; but the people here were much more horrible than any of
   them. Job, whom I saw clearing the evil beasts from around his dwelling
   by his prayers, had such a horror of these godless folk that he often
   broke out in loud reproaches of them, saying that he would rather live
   with all these dreadful beasts than with the infamous inhabitants of
   this land. I often saw him at sunrise gazing longingly towards his own
   country, which hay a little to the south of the farthest country of the
   three holy kings. Job saw prophetic pictures foreshadowing the arrival
   in Egypt of the children of Israel; he also had visions of the
   salvation of mankind and of the trials that awaited himself. He would
   not be persuaded to stay in Egypt, and at the end of five years he and
   his companions left the country.

   There were intervals of calm between the great misfortunes that befell
   Job: the first interval lasted nine years, the second seven, and the
   third twelve. The words in the Book of Job: "And while he (the
   messenger of evil) was yet speaking" mean "This misfortune of his was
   still the talk of the people when the following befell him." [175] His
   misfortunes came upon him in three different places. The last
   calamity--and also the restoration of all his prosperity--happened when
   he was hiving in a flat country directly to the east of Jericho.
   Incense and myrrh were found here, and there was also a gold-mine with
   smithies. At another time I saw much more about Job, which I will tell
   later. For the present I will only say that Job's story of himself and
   of his talking with God were written down at his dictation by two
   trusty servants of his, like treasurers. Their names were Hai and Uis
   or Ois. [176] This story was preserved by his descendants as a sacred
   treasure, and was handed down from generation to generation until it
   reached Abraham and his sons. It was used for purposes of instruction,
   and came into Egypt with the children of Israel. Moses used it to
   comfort and console the Israelites during the Egyptian oppression and
   their journey through the desert, but in a summarized version, for it
   was originally of much greater length, and a great deal of it would
   have been incomprehensible to them. Solomon again remodeled it, so that
   it is a religious work full of the wisdom of Job, Moses, and Solomon.
   It was difficult to recognize the true history of Job from it, for the
   names of persons and places had been changed to ones nearer Canaan, and
   it was thought that Job was an Edomite because the last place where he
   lived was inhabited long after his death by Edomites, the descendants
   of Esau. Job might still have been alive when Abraham was born.

  29.2 THE SPRING AT MATAREA - ABRAHAM LIVES A LONG TIME BY IT.

   When Abraham was in Egypt, he also had his tents beside this spring,
   and I saw him teaching the people here. [177] He lived in the country
   several years with Sarah and a number of his sons and daughters whose
   mothers had remained behind in Chaldea. His brother Lot was also here
   with his family, but I do not remember what place of residence was
   assigned to him. Abraham went to Egypt by God's command, firstly
   because of a famine in the Land of Canaan, and secondly to fetch a
   family treasure which had found its way to Egypt through a niece of
   Sarah's mother. This niece was of the race of the shepherd-people
   belonging to Job's tribe who had been rulers of part of Egypt. She had
   gone there to be serving maid to the reigning family and had then
   married an Egyptian. She was also the foundress of a tribe, but I have
   forgotten its name. Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, was a descendant of
   hers and was thus of Sarah's family. [178]

   The woman had carried off this family treasure just as Rachel had
   carried off Laban's household gods, and had sold it in Egypt for a
   great sum. In this way it had come into the possession of the king and
   the priests. This treasure was a genealogy of the children of Noah
   (especially of the children of Shem) down to Abraham's time. It looked
   like a scales hanging on several chains from inside a lid. [Please
   refer to Figure 22.] This lid was made to shut down onto a sort of box
   which enclosed the chains in it. The chains were made of triangular
   pieces of gold linked together; the names of each generation were
   engraved on these pieces, which were thick yellow coins, while the
   links connecting them were pale like silver and thin. Some of the gold
   pieces had a number of others hanging from them. The whole treasure was
   bright and shining. I heard, but have forgotten, what was its value in
   shekels. The Egyptian priests had made endless calculations in
   connection with this genealogy, but never arrived at the right
   conclusion.

   Before Abraham came into their country, the Egyptians must have known,
   from their astrologers and from the prophecies of their sorceresses,
   that he and his wife came from the noblest of races and that he was to
   be the father of a chosen people. They were always searching in their
   prophetic books for noble races, and tried to intermarry with them.
   This gave Satan the opportunity of attempting to debase the pure races
   by leading the Egyptians astray into immorality and deeds of violence.

   Abraham, fearing that he might be murdered by the Egyptians because of
   the beauty of Sarah, his wife, had given out that she was his sister.
   This was not a lie, since she was his step-sister, the daughter of his
   father Terah by another wife (see Gen. 20.12). The King of Egypt caused
   Sarah to be brought into his palace and wished to take her to wife.
   Abraham and Sarah were then in great distress and besought God for
   help, whereupon God punished the king with sickness, and all his wives
   and most of the women in the city fell ill. The king, in alarm, caused
   inquiry to be made, and when he heard that Sarah was Abraham's wife, he
   gave her back to him, begging him to leave Egypt as soon as possible.
   It was clear, he said, that Abraham and his wife were under the
   protection of the gods.

   down to Abraham's time.

   The Egyptians were a strange people. On the one hand they were
   extremely arrogant and considered themselves to be the greatest and
   wisest among the nations. On the other hand they were excessively
   cowardly and servile, and gave way when they were faced by a power
   which they feared was greater than theirs. This was because they were
   not sure of all their knowledge, most of which came to them in dark
   ambiguous sooth-sayings, which easily produced conflicts and
   contradictions. Since they were very credulous of wonders, any such
   contradiction at once caused them great alarm.

   Abraham approached the king very humbly with a request for corn. He won
   his favor by treating him as a ruler over the nations, and received
   many rich presents. When the King gave Sarah back to her husband and
   begged him to leave Egypt, Abraham replied that he could not do this
   unless he took with him the genealogy that belonged to him, describing
   in detail the manner in which it had come to Egypt. The king then
   summoned the priests, and they willingly gave Abraham back what
   belonged to him, only asking that the whole transaction might first be
   formally recorded, which was done. [179] Abraham then returned with his
   following to the land of Canaan.

   I have seen many things about the spring at Matarea right down to our
   own times, and remember this much: already at the time of the Holy
   Family it was used by lepers as a healing well. Much later a small
   Christian church was built on the site of Mary's dwelling. Near the
   high altar of this church one descended into the cave where the Holy
   Family lived until Joseph had arranged their dwelling. I saw the spring
   with human habitations round it, and I saw it being used for various
   forms of skin eruptions. I also saw people bathing in it to cure
   themselves of evil-smelling perspirations. That was when the
   Mohammedans were there. I saw, too, that the Turks always kept a light
   burning in the church over Mary's dwelling. They feared some misfortune
   if they forgot to light it. In later times I saw the spring isolated
   and at some distance from any houses. There was no longer a city there,
   and wild fruit trees grew about it.

   [146] Matt. 2.13-18. (SB)

   [147] Since Matthew alone gives the account of the Magi and of the
   Flight into Egypt, and Luke alone that of the Presentation, it is not
   easy to decide the exact order of events. According to AC the Magi came
   to Bethlehem before the Presentation, and the angel's warning came to
   Joseph at Nazareth some time after it. If Jesus was by then nine months
   old. In this case the words of Matt. 2.13, "And after they [the Magi]
   were departed, behold an angel . . .", refer to the passage of over
   seven months and a removal to Nazareth. This interval between the visit
   of the Magi and the Flight into Egypt certainly offers an explanation
   of a chronological problem. (SB)

   [148] According to this account Joseph evidently intended to give up
   the house at Nazareth, and presumably to carry out his plan of moving
   to Bethlehem (cf. AC, p. 78 , and n. 128, p. 119 ). All this helps to
   explain why we get the impression from Matt. 2.22-23 that Joseph really
   wanted to settle in Judea but came to Nazareth almost faute de mieux.
   (SB)

   [149] Clearly the despised Samaritans, cf., e.g., John 4.9, 20 (where
   their worship on Mount Garizim is mentioned). (SB)

   [150] Fifteen years after Catherine Emmerich's death, when the writer
   was putting together her account of the Flight into Egypt, he wondered
   why the Holy Family should have remained in Nazara a whole day. It was
   only then that he discovered that the Sabbath began on the evening of
   March 2nd, 1821, so that the Holy Family must have kept it in secret
   here, though Catherine Emmerich made no mention of this. (CB)

   [151] The identification of Nazara, Legio, and Massaloth is uncertain,
   but they are probably in the hill country south of the Vale of
   Esdrelon, and are so placed by Fahsel. (SB)

   [152] The Biblical references to all these places are given supra, p.
   80 . (SB)

   [153] The story of Elizabeth's concealing the boy John the Baptist is
   found in Protev. 22, but with a typical addition in the fanciful detail
   of the mountain splitting to receive them into hiding. (SB)

   [154] David kept his father's sheep near Bethlehem: 1 Kings ( Sam.)
   17.15. Bethlehem is about twelve miles from Mambre. (SB)

   [155] In her general description of the Flight into Egypt she forgot to
   mention this refuge of the Holy Family. The description given above is
   taken from her daily account of Our Lord's ministry, at the time when,
   after His baptism, He visited with some of His disciples all the places
   near Bethlehem where His Mother had been with Him. She saw Jesus, after
   His baptism by John, which she described on Friday, Sept. 28th, 1821,
   staying in this cave with His disciples from Oct. 8th to Oct. 9th, and
   she heard Him speak of the graces given in this place and of the
   hardships and difficulties of the Flight into Egypt. He blessed this
   cave and told them that one day a church would be built over it. On
   Oct. 18th she said: This refuge of the Holy Family was later called
   Mary's place of sojourn, and was visited by pilgrims who were, however,
   ignorant of its real history. Later only poor people lived there.' She
   gave a precise description of the place, and some time afterwards the
   writer found to his great astonishment an account by the Minorite friar
   Antonio Gonzalez of his journey to Jerusalem (Antwerp, 1679, Part I, p.
   556), in which he stated that he had been in a village of Mary's', a
   short mile on the left of the road from Hebron to Bethlehem, where she
   had taken refuge on the Flight. It was, he said, on a hill, and a
   church with three vaults and three doors was still standing there, with
   a picture on its wall of Mary and her Child on the donkey, led by
   Joseph. Below the hill on which stood the village and church was a
   beautiful spring of water, known as Mary's fountain. All of this agrees
   with the place described by Catherine Emmerich. Arvieux says in the
   second volume of his Memoirs (Leipzig, 1783): Between Hebron and
   Bethlehem we came through the village of the Blessed Virgin, who is
   said to have rested here during her Flight.' (CB)

   [156] None of the many details of the life of the young John the
   Baptist in the desert are found in any available document. (SB)

   [157] Catherine Emmerich heard Our Lord Himself relate this touching
   incident in her visions of Our Lord's ministry. It was on January 14
   ^th (Tuesday, the 26 ^th day of the month Thebet) of the third year of
   His ministry, in the house of John's parents at Juttah, in the presence
   of the Blessed Virgin, Peter, John and three trusty disciples of the
   Baptist. A carpet had been spread out before them, which had been
   worked by Mary and Elizabeth after the Visitation: it had been
   embroidered with many significant texts. Our Lord was speaking with
   comforting words of the Baptist's murder, which had taken place on the
   20 ^th of the month Thebet (Jan. 8 ^th) at Herod's birthday feast at
   Machaerus. He spoke much about John on this occasion and said that He
   had only seen him twice in the flesh; that time on the Flight to Egypt
   and the second time at His baptism. (CB)

   [158] The first mention by Catherine Emmerich of this inn was in her
   account of Christ's ministry. On Oct. 8th after His baptism Our Lord
   came here alone from the Valley of the Shepherds. He converted Reuben
   and healed several sick people while His disciples waited for Him in
   the cave of refuge near Ephraim. He taught at the places where the Holy
   Family had rested and taken food, and explained to the inhabitants that
   the grace given to them now was the fruit of the hospitality shown by
   them to the Holy Family. On His journey between here and the cave near
   Ephraim He passed by Hebron. A place called Anim or Anem, nine miles
   south of Hebron in the district of Daroma, is mentioned by Jerome and
   also by Eusebius. (CB) Anim is mentioned among the hill cities of Judah
   in Jos. 15.50, together with Juttah (Douay Jota) in 55 and Hebron in
   54. (SB)

   [159] The apocryphal Ps-Matt. 18-19 includes details of wild beasts in
   the desert on the way to Egypt, but the account is very fanciful and
   tells how they wagged their tails in reverence, and so forth, and how
   the Child Jesus spoke to the creatures and comforted His mother. (SB)

   [160] The encounter with robbers occurs in the Arabic Gospel of the
   Infancy, 23, where the robbers Titus and Dymachus are the future
   thieves at the Crucifixion. According to AC it was at the robbers' hut
   that a boy was cured of leprosy by being washed in Our Lord's
   bath-water, and this boy (nameless) became the Good Thief at the
   Crucifixion (infra, p. 146 ). The same Arabic source has the episode of
   the bath-water on three occasions (17, 31, 32). In the apocryphal
   Gospel of Nicodemus, 10, the Good Thief is called Dismas (his
   traditional name), and the Bad Thief Gestas (or Gistas). (SB)

   [161] We quote the whole of this incident, as well as many others of
   the Flight into Egypt, from the accounts given by Catherine Emmerich of
   the conversations with Jesus of Eliud, an aged Essene, who accompanied
   Our Lord on His journey from Nazareth to be baptized by John. Eliud
   said that Anna the prophetess had told him that she had heard of this
   incident from the Blessed Virgin. (CB)

   [162] The palm-tree that bowed appears (on the Flight) in Ps-Matt. 20,
   but there the little Jesus is figured as addressing the tree and also
   commanding it to straighten itself afterwards. (SB)

   [163] Joseph married Asenath: Gen. 41.50. (SB)

   [164] The idol falling when the Holy Family reached Egypt is mentioned
   in Ps-Matt. 23 (all the idols) and in the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy,
   10, Cf. supra, p. 29 and n. (SB)

   [165] The presence of a Jewish temple built on the ruins of
   Leontopolis, on the outskirts of Heliopolis, is well known from
   Josephus (Ant., XIII, iii, 1-4), who explains that it was built by
   Onias (IV) after his flight from Palestine, c. 170 B.C., like indeed to
   that at Jerusalem, but smaller and poorer '. Cf. also BJ, VII, x, 3.
   (SB)

   [166] This was recounted while Catherine Emmerich was seriously ill;
   she mentioned several journeys and other matters connected with Herod's
   family, but very obscurely. The statement that Herod had been in Rome
   in the meantime was the only clear one. Some fifteen years after this
   communication, the writer reread the history of Herod the Great given
   by the Jewish historian Josephus, but found no mention of any journey
   of Herod's to Rome at this time. (CB)

   [167] It has already been observed (n. 148, p. 141 ) that Matt. 2.13,
   according to AC, involves the passing of over seven months. Here we are
   told that Jesus was nearly eighteen months old, so that Matt. 2.16,
   Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded . . . sending killed . . .',
   shows the passage of a further nine months to the murder of the
   Innocents. The Gospel has no details beyond the fact of the massacre.
   (SB)

   [168] Perhaps this refers to the Roman numeral DCC =700 (AC always saw
   Roman numerals). She mentions (supra, p. 149 ) that the massacres took
   place in seven different places, and the Gospel ( Matt. 2.16) indicates
   a whole district: Bethlehem and all the borders thereof.' (SB)

   [169] Troja and Babylon near Memphis, and Matarea near Heliopolis or
   On, are all readily identifiable in the region of the modern Cairo. At
   Matarea it is said that the Tree of Our Lady' is still shown. The tree
   is also mentioned in the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy, 24. (SB)

   [170] The murder of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist, is
   recounted in Protev. 23, with subsequent portents added. (SB)

   [171] The earlier Zechariah killed near the altar is in 2 Chr.
   24.20-21. There is a well-known difficulty in Matt. 23.35, where this
   Zechariah is called son of Barachiah', when 2 Chr. gives his father's
   name as Joiada. It is generally agreed that the verse in Matt. includes
   a scribal error, arising from the fact that the much better-known
   Prophet Zechariah's father was called Barechiah ( Zech. 1.1), and that
   the two names were thus linked in the scribe's memory. This supposition
   is borne out by the omission of a father's name in Matt. in Codex
   Sinaiticus. The parallel in Luke 11.51 has no father's name. Yet all
   texts of Matt. before the discovery of Sinaiticus in 1859 include the
   name, and it is hardly surprising that AC should do so too. (SB)

   [172] The Book of Job gives no clue to the ancestry, offspring. or
   homeland of Job, and (as AC remarks, infra, p. 155 ) it is difficult to
   recognize the true history of Job from it. Job is only mentioned
   elsewhere in the Old Testament as a just man, together with Noe and
   Daniel ( Ezekiel 14.14, 16, 20). Rabbinic lore has, however, many
   accounts of the circumstances of Job's family; some texts place Job as
   a contemporary of Abraham, while others place him earlier or later.
   There are several accounts of his visit to Egypt. The list of such
   Rabbinic texts is too great to insert here, but a general account of
   them will be found in the Jewish Encyclopedia, art. Job, p. 193b. (SB)

   [173] It is remarkable that she said on another occasion that the Black
   Sea had been before the Flood a high mountain on which evil angels held
   sway. This seems to show that the mountain range behind which Job's
   first dwelling-place was situated must have been the Caucasus. (CB)

   [174] The Hyksos or Shepherd Kings' were foreign rulers in Egypt, c .
   1730-1580 B.C., who were finally driven out by a native dynasty. (SB)

   [175] The phrase while he was yet speaking' occurs in Job 1.16, 17, 18.
   The text certainly suggests a quick succession of calamities, but if
   AC's statement of intervals of nine, seven, and twelve years between
   the calamities is correct, it is easier to suppose the story to have
   been telescoped for the purpose of the drama as we know it, than to
   interpret the text (as AC suggests) as meaning while it was still the
   talk of the people'. (SB)

   [176] In 1835 the writer heard that the founder of the Armenian race
   was so named. (CB)

   [177] Flavius Josephus (lib. I, Antiquitat. Jud., c. 8) and others
   state that Abraham instructed the Egyptians in arithmetic and
   astrology. (CB) Abraham in Egypt: Gen. 12.13. That Lot was with him is
   shown by 13.1. He pretended that his wife was his sister a second time
   (20.2) after which the explanation referred to is given (20.12). That
   Abraham taught the Egyptians is an old Jewish tradition, preserved in
   Josephus, Ant., I, viii, 2, and there are many Rabbinic stories about
   his sojourn in Egypt, especially in the Midrash (e.g. Genesis Rabba,
   XLI and XLIV). (SB)

   [178] Catherine Emmerich says elsewhere of Hagar: She was of Sarah's
   family, and when Sarah herself was barren, she gave Abraham Hagar for
   his wife and said she would build from her and have descendants through
   her. She looked upon herself as one with all the women of her tribe, as
   if it were a female tree with many blossoms. Hagar was a vessel, or
   flower of her tribe, and she hoped for a fruit of her tribe from her.
   At that time the whole tribe was as one tree and each of its blossoms
   formed part of it. (CB) Gen. 16.1 simply states that Hagar was an
   Egyptian. (SB)

   [179] Gen. 12.20 (literally from the Hebrew): "And Pharaoh gave men
   orders concerning him, and sent him away, and his wife, and all that
   belonged to him." (SB)

              XVII. THE RETURN OF THE HOLY FAMILY FROM EGYPT [180]

   At last I saw the Holy Family leaving Egypt. Though Herod had been dead
   for some time, they were not yet able to return, for there was still
   danger. Their sojourn in Egypt became increasingly difficult for St.
   Joseph. The people there practiced an abominable idolatry, sacrificing
   deformed children, and even thinking it an act of special piety to
   offer healthy ones to be sacrificed. Besides this, they practiced
   obscene rites in secret. Even the Jews in their settlement had become
   infected by these horrors. They had a temple which they said was like
   Solomon's temple, but this was idle boasting, for it was utterly
   different. They had an Ark of the Covenant in imitation of the real
   one, but it contained obscene figures, and their ceremonies were
   abominable. They no longer sang the psalms. Joseph, on the other hand,
   had arranged everything admirably in the school at Matarea. He had been
   joined there by the heathen priest who had taken the Holy Family's part
   when the idols collapsed in the little town near Heliopolis. Others had
   accompanied him and had attached themselves to the Jewish community.

   I saw St. Joseph busy at his carpentry on the eve of the Sabbath. He
   was in great distress because he was not given the payment due to him,
   and he had nothing to take home, where money was much needed. In his
   trouble he knelt down under the open sky in a corner and prayed to God
   to help him in his need. The next night I saw that an angel came to him
   in a dream, saying that those who had sought the life of the child were
   dead, and that he was to rise up and make ready to journey home from
   Egypt by the high road; he was to have no fear, for the angel would
   accompany him. I saw St. Joseph communicating to the Blessed Virgin and
   to the Child Jesus this command that he had received from God, and I
   saw them preparing as promptly and obediently for their journey home as
   they had done when warned to flee into Egypt.

   When their decision became known next morning, many people came to them
   in great distress to say farewell, bringing with them all kinds of
   presents in little vessels of bark. They were mostly Jews, but some
   were converted heathen and all were truly grieved. (The Jews in this
   country were so sunk in idolatry as hardly to be recognized. There were
   some people here who were glad at the departure of the Holy Family,
   looking on them as sorcerers who owed their power to the mightiest
   among the evil spirits.) Amongst the good people who brought presents I
   saw mothers with their little boys who had been Jesus' playfellows.
   Among these I particularly noticed a prominent woman of that town with
   her small son whom she used to call the son of Mary'; for this woman,
   who was named Mira, had long hoped for children, and had, by the
   prayers of the Blessed Virgin, been granted this son by God. She had
   called him Deodatus. [When Catherine Emmerich saw Jesus passing through
   Egypt on His way to Jacob's well after the raising of Lazarus, she said
   that He took this Deodatus with Him as a disciple.] I saw this woman
   giving money to Jesus--yellow, white, and brown pieces, triangular in
   shape. Jesus looked at His Mother as He accepted this gift.

   As soon as Joseph had packed on the donkey all that they needed, they
   started on their journey, accompanied by all their friends. The donkey
   was the same one on which Mary had journeyed to Bethlehem. (On their
   flight into Egypt they had also had a she-ass with them, but Joseph had
   been obliged to sell her when they were in want.) They went between On
   and the Jewish settlement, and then turned southwards to the spring
   which had gushed forth in answer to Mary's prayer before they came to
   On or Heliopolis. All was now green here, and the stream from the
   spring encircled a garden, surrounded on all four sides (except for the
   entrance) by a hedge of balsam shrubs. This garden was as big as Duke
   Croy's riding school at Dülmen, and in it were young fruit trees, date
   palms, and sycamores. The balsam shrubs were already as big as
   good-sized vines. Joseph had made little vessels of bark, very smooth
   and delicate except for the places where they were smeared with pitch.
   While they were resting he often made vessels like these for various
   uses. He broke off the trefoil-shaped leaves from the reddish tendrils
   of the balsam, and hung his little bark bottles on the shrub to catch
   the falling drops of balsam for them to take with them on their
   journey. Their companions now took a tender farewell of them, after
   which the Holy Family remained some hours here. The Blessed Virgin
   washed and dried some things, and after refreshing themselves with
   water and filling their water-skin, they started on their journey along
   the highway. I saw many pictures of them on this journey home, always
   free from danger. The Child Jesus, Mary, and Joseph had on their heads,
   to protect them from the sun, a round piece of thin bark tied under
   their chins with a cloth. Jesus had His brown dress on, and wore shoes
   of bark which Joseph had made for Him. They were arranged so as to
   cover half His feet. Mary wore only soles. I saw that she was often
   worried because the Child Jesus found it so difficult to walk in the
   hot sand. I often saw her stopping to shake the sand out of His shoes.
   He often had to ride on the donkey so as to rest. I saw them go through
   several towns and pass by others. Their names have escaped me, though I
   still remember the name Rameses. They crossed some water which they had
   also crossed on their journey into Egypt. It inns from the Red Sea to
   the Nile.

   Joseph did not really want to go back to Nazareth, but wished to settle
   in his ancestral home of Bethlehem. He was, however, still irresolute,
   since on arriving in the Promised Land he heard that Judea was governed
   by Archelaus, who like Herod was very cruel. I saw that the Holy Family
   stayed about three months in Gaza, where there were many heathen. Here
   an angel again appeared to Joseph in a dream and commanded him to go to
   Nazareth, which he did at once. [181] Anna was still alive. She and a
   few relations knew where the Holy Family had been living. The return
   from Egypt happened in September. Jesus was nearly eight years old.

             XVIII. THE DEATH OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY AT EPHESUS

   The following communications, made in different years, generally in the
   middle of August before the Feast of the Assumption, are here arranged
   in chronological order.

1. REGARDING MARY'S AGE.

   [On the morning of August 13 ^th, 1822, Catherine Emmerich said: Last
   night I had a great vision of the death of the Blessed Virgin, but have
   completely forgotten it all.' On being asked, in the middle of a
   conversation on everyday matters, how old the Blessed Virgin was when
   she died, Catherine Emmerich suddenly looked away and said: She reached
   the age of sixty-four years all but three and twenty days: I have just
   seen the figure X six times, then I, then V; is not that sixty-four?'
   (It is remarkable that Catherine Emmerich was not shown numbers with
   our ordinary Arabic figures, with which she was familiar, but never saw
   anything but Roman figures in her visions).]

   After Christ's Ascension Mary lived for three years on Mount Sion, for
   three years in Bethany, and for nine years in Ephesus, whither St. John
   took her soon after the Jews had set Lazarus and his sisters adrift
   upon the sea. [182]

   Mary did not live in Ephesus itself, but in the country near it where
   several women who were her close friends had settled. [183] Mary's
   dwelling was on a hill to the left of the road from Jerusalem some
   three and a half hours from Ephesus. [184] This hill slopes steeply
   towards Ephesus; the city as one approaches it from the south-east
   seems to lie on rising ground immediately before one, but seems to
   change its place as one draws nearer. Great avenues lead up to the
   city, and the ground under the trees is covered with yellow fruit.
   Narrow paths lead southwards to a hill near the top of which is an
   uneven plateau, some half-hour's journey in circumference, overgrown,
   like the hill itself, with wild trees and bushes. It was on this
   plateau that the Jewish settlers had made their home. It is a very
   lonely place, but has many fertile and pleasant slopes as well as
   rock-caves, clean and dry and surrounded by patches of sand. It is wild
   but not desolate, and scattered about it are a number of trees,
   pyramid-shaped, with big shady branches below and smooth trunks.

   John had had a house built for the Blessed Virgin before he brought her
   here. Several Christian families and holy women had already settled
   here, some in caves in the earth or in the rocks, fitted out with light
   woodwork to make dwellings, and some in fragile huts or tents. They had
   come here to escape violent persecution. Their dwellings were like
   hermits' cells, for they used as their refuges what nature offered
   them. As a rule, they lived at a quarter of an hour's distance from
   each other. The whole settlement was like a scattered village. Mary's
   house was the only one built of stone. A little way behind it was the
   summit of the rocky hill from which one could see over the trees and
   hills to Ephesus and the sea with its many islands. The place is nearer
   the sea than Ephesus, which must be several hours' journey distant from
   the coast. The district is lonely and unfrequented. Near here is a
   castle inhabited by a king who seems to have been deposed. John visited
   him often and ended by converting him. This place later became a
   bishop's see. Between the Blessed Virgin's dwelling and Ephesus runs a
   little stream which winds about in a very singular way.

2. MARY'S HOUSE IN EPHESUS.

   Mary's house was built of rectangular stones, rounded or pointed at the
   back. The windows were high up near the flat roof. The house was
   divided into two compartments by the hearth in the center of it. The
   fireplace was on the floor opposite the door; it was sunk into the
   ground beside a wall which rose in steps on each side of it up to the
   ceiling. In the center of this wall a deep channel, like the half of a
   chimney, carried the smoke up to escape by an opening in the roof. I
   saw a sloping copper funnel projecting above the roof over this
   opening.

   The front part of the house was divided from the room behind the
   fireplace by light movable wicker screens on each side of the hearth.
   In this front part, the walls of which were rather rough and also
   blackened by smoke, I saw little cells on both sides, shut in by wicker
   screens fastened together. If this part of the house was needed as one
   large room, these screens, which did not nearly reach to the ceiling,
   were taken apart and put aside. These cells were used as bedrooms for
   Mary's maidservant and for other women who came to visit her.

   To the right and left of the hearth, doors led into the back part of
   the house, which was darker than the front part and ended in a
   semicircle or angle. It was neatly and pleasantly arranged; the walls
   were covered with wickerwork, and the ceiling was vaulted. Its beams
   were decorated with a mixture of paneling and wickerwork, and
   ornamented with a pattern of leaves. It was all simple and dignified.

   The farthest corner or apse of this room was divided off by a curtain
   and formed Mary.s oratory. In the center of the wall was a niche in
   which had been placed a receptacle like a tabernacle, which could be
   opened and shut by pulling at a string to turn its door. In it stood a
   cross about the length of a man.s arm in which were inserted two arms
   rising outwards and upwards, in the form of the letter Y, the shape in
   which I have always seen Christ.s Cross. It had no particular
   ornamentation, and was more roughly carved than the crosses which come
   from the Holy Land nowadays. I think that John and Mary must have made
   it themselves. It was made of different kinds of wood. It was told me
   that the pale stem of the cross was cypress, the brown arm cedar, and
   the other arm of yellow palm-wood, while the piece added at the top,
   with the title, was of smooth yellow olive-wood. This cross was set in
   a little mound of earth or stone, like Christ.s Cross on Mount Calvary.
   At its foot there lay a piece of parchment with something written on
   it; Christ.s words, I think. On the cross itself the Figure of Our Lord
   was roughly outlined, the lines of the carving being rubbed with darker
   color so as to show the Figure plainly. Mary.s meditation on the
   different kinds of wood forming the cross were communicated to me, but
   alas I have forgotten this beautiful lesson. Nor can I for the moment
   be sure whether Christ.s Cross itself was made of these different kinds
   of wood, or whether Mary had made this cross in this way only for
   devotional reasons. It stood between two small vases filled with fresh
   flowers.

   I also saw a cloth lying beside the cross, and had the impression that
   it was the one with which the Blessed Virgin had wiped the blood from
   all the wounds in Our Lord.s holy body after it was taken down from the
   cross. The reason why I had this impression was that, at the sight of
   the cloth, I was shown that manifestation of the Blessed Virgin.s
   motherly love. At the same time I had the feeling that it was the cloth
   which priests use at Mass, after drinking the Precious Blood, to
   cleanse the chalice; Mary, in wiping the

   Lord.s wounds, seemed to me to be acting in the same way, and as she
   did it she held the cloth just as the priest does. Such was the
   impression I had at the sight of the cloth beside the cross.

   To the right of this oratory, against a niche in the wall, was the
   sleeping place or cell of the Blessed Virgin. Opposite it, to the left
   of the oratory, was a cell where her clothes and other belongings were
   kept. Between these two cells a curtain was hung dividing off the
   oratory. It was Mary.s custom to sit in front of this curtain when she
   was working or reading. The sleeping place of the Blessed Virgin was
   backed by a wall hung with a woven carpet; the side-walls were light
   screens of bark woven in different-colored woods to make a pattern. The
   front wall was hung with a carpet, and had a door with two panels,
   opening inwards. The ceiling of this cell was also of wickerwork rising
   into a vault from the center of which was suspended a lamp with several
   arms. Mary.s couch, which was placed against the wall, was a box one
   and a half feet high and of the breadth and length of a narrow plank. A
   covering was stretched on it and fastened to a knob at each of the four
   corners. The sides of this box were covered with carpets reaching down
   to the floor and were decorated with tassels and fringes. A round
   cushion served as pillow, and there was a covering of brownish material
   with a check pattern. The little house stood near a wood among
   pyramid-shaped trees with smooth trunks. It was very quiet and
   solitary. The dwellings of the other families were all scattered about
   at some distance. The whole settlement was like a village of peasants.

3. MARY.S MAIDSERVANT AND JOHN THE APOSTLE.

   The Blessed Virgin lived here alone, with a younger woman, her
   maidservant, who fetched what little food they needed. They lived very
   quietly and in profound peace. There was no man in the house, but
   sometimes they were visited by an Apostle or disciple on his travels.
   There was one man whom I saw more often than others going in and out of
   the house; I always took him to be John, but neither here nor in
   Jerusalem did he remain permanently near the Blessed Virgin. He came
   and went in the course of his travels. He did not wear

   the same dress as in Jesus. time. His garment was very long and hung in
   folds, and was of a thin grayish-white material. He was very slim and
   active, his face was long, narrow, and delicate, and on his bare head
   his long fair hair was parted and brushed back behind his ears. In
   contrast with the other Apostles, this gave him a womanish, almost
   girlish appearance. Last time he was here I saw Mary becoming ever
   quieter and more meditative: she took hardly any nourishment. It was as
   if she were only here in appearance, as if her spirit had already
   passed beyond and her whole being was far away. In the last weeks
   before she died I sometimes saw her, weak and aged, being led about the
   house by her maidservant.

   Once I saw John come into the house, looking much older too, and very
   thin and haggard. As he came in he girt up his long white ample garment
   in his girdle, then took off this girdle and put on another one,
   inscribed with letters, which he drew out from under his robe. He put a
   sort of maniple on his arm and a stole round his neck. The Blessed
   Virgin came in from her bedchamber completely enveloped in a white
   robe, and leaning on her maidservant.s arm. Her face was white as snow
   and as though transparent. She seemed to be swaying with intense
   longing. Since Jesus. Ascension her whole being seemed to be filled
   with an ever-increasing yearning which gradually consumed her. John and
   she went together to the oratory. The Blessed Virgin pulled at the
   ribbon or strap which turned the tabernacle in the wall to show the
   cross in it. After they had knelt for a long time in prayer before it,
   John rose and drew from his breast a metal box. Opening it at one side,
   he drew from it a wrapping of material of fine wool, and out of this
   took a little folded cloth of white material. From this he took out the
   Blessed Sacrament in the form of a small square white particle. After
   speaking a few solemn words, he gave the Sacrament to the Blessed
   Virgin. He did not give her a chalice.

   Behind the house, at a little distance up the hill, the Blessed Virgin
   had made a kind of Way of the Cross. When she was living in Jerusalem,
   she had never failed, ever since Our Lord.s

   death, to follow His path to Calvary with tears of compassion. She had
   paced out and measured all the distances between the Stations of that
   Via Crucis, and her love for her Son made her unable to live without
   this constant contemplation of His sufferings. Soon after her arrival
   at her new home I saw her every day climbing part of the way up the
   hill behind her house to carry out this devotion. At first she went by
   herself, measuring the number of steps, so often counted by her, which
   separated the places of Our Lord's different sufferings. At each of
   these places she put up a stone, or, if there was already a tree there,
   she made a mark upon it. The way led into a wood, and upon a hill in
   this wood she had marked the place of Calvary, and the grave of Christ
   in a little cave in another hill. After she had marked this Way of the
   Cross with twelve Stations, she went there with her maidservant in
   quiet meditation: at each Station they sat down and renewed the mystery
   of its significance in their hearts, praising the Lord for His love
   with tears of compassion. Afterwards she arranged the Stations better,
   and I saw her inscribing on the stones the meaning of each Station, the
   number of paces and so forth. I saw, too, that she cleaned out the cave
   of the Holy Sepulcher and made it a place for prayer. At that time I
   saw no picture and no fixed cross to designate the Stations, nothing
   but plain memorial stones with inscriptions, but afterwards, as the
   result of constant visits and attention, I saw the place becoming
   increasingly beautiful and easy of approach. After the Blessed Virgin's
   death I saw this Way of the Cross being visited by Christians, who
   threw themselves down and kissed the ground.

4. MARY TRAVELS FROM EPHESUS TO JERUSALEM.

   After three years' sojourn here Mary had a great longing to see
   Jerusalem again, and was taken there by John and Peter. Several of the
   Apostles were, I believe, assembled there: I saw Thomas among them and
   I think a Council was held at which Mary assisted them with her advice.
   On their arrival at Jerusalem in the dusk of the evening, before they
   went into the city, I saw them visiting the Mount of Olives, Calvary,
   the Holy Sepulcher, and all the holy places outside Jerusalem. The
   Mother of God was so sorrowful and so moved by compassion that she
   could hardly hold herself upright, and Peter and John had to support
   her as they led her away.

   She came to Jerusalem from Ephesus once again, [185] eighteen months
   before her death, and I saw her again visiting the Holy Places with the
   Apostles at night, wrapped in a veil. She was inexpressibly sorrowful,
   constantly sighing, O my Son, my Son'. When she came to that door
   behind the palace where she had met Jesus sinking under the weight of
   the Cross, she too sank to the ground in a swoon, overcome by agonizing
   memories, and her companions thought she was dying. They brought her to
   Sion, to the Cenacle, where she was living in one of the outer
   buildings. Here for several days she was so weak and ill and so often
   suffered from fainting attacks that her companions again and again
   thought her end was near and made preparations for her burial. She
   herself chose a cave in the Mount of Olives, and the Apostles caused a
   beautiful sepulcher to be prepared here by the hands of a Christian
   stonemason. [At another time Catherine Emmerich said that St. Andrew
   had also helped in this work.] During this time it was announced more
   than once that she was dead, and the rumor of her death and burial was
   spread abroad in Jerusalem and in other places as well. By the time,
   however, that the sepulcher was ready, [186] she had recovered and was
   strong enough to journey back to her home in Ephesus, where she did in
   fact die eighteen months later. The sepulcher prepared for her on the
   Mount of Olives was always held in honor, and later a church was built
   over it, and John Damascene (so I heard in the spirit, but who and what
   was he?) [187] wrote from hearsay that she had died and been buried in
   Jerusalem. I expect that the news of her death, burial-place, and
   assumption into heaven were permitted by God to be indefinite and only
   a matter of tradition in order that Christianity in its early days
   should not be in danger of heathen influences then so powerful. The
   Blessed Virgin might easily have been adored as a goddess.

5. RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OF THE HOLY FAMILY WHO ALSO LIVE IN EPHESUS.

   Amongst the holy women living in the Christian settlement near Ephesus
   and visiting the Blessed Virgin in her house was the daughter of a
   sister of Anna, the prophetess of the Temple. I saw her once traveling
   to Nazareth with Seraphia (Veronica) before Jesus' baptism. This woman
   was related to the Holy Family through Anna, for Anna was related to
   St. Anne and still more closely to Elizabeth, St. Anne's niece. Another
   of the women living in Mary's neighborhood, whom I had also seen on her
   way to Nazareth before Jesus' baptism, was a niece of Elizabeth's
   called Mara. She was related to the Holy Family in the following way:
   St. Anne's mother Ismeria had a sister called Emerentia, both living in
   the pasture-lands of Mara between Mount Horeb and the Red Sea. She was
   told by the head of the Essenes on Mount Horeb that among her
   descendants would be friends of the Messiah. She married Aphras, of the
   family of the priests who had carried the Ark of the Covenant.
   Emerentia had three daughters: Elizabeth, the mother of the Baptist,
   Enue (who was present as a widow at the birth of the Blessed Virgin in
   St. Anne's house), and Rhoda, whose daughter Mara was, as I have said,
   now at Ephesus. Rhoda had married far away from the home of her family:
   she lived first in the region of Shechem, then in Nazareth and at
   Casaloth on Mount Thabor. Besides Mara she had two other daughters, and
   the sons of one of these became disciples. One of Rhoda's two sons was
   the first husband of Maroni, who, when he died, married as a childless
   widow Eliud, a nephew of St. Anne, and went to live at Naim. Maroni had
   by this Eliud a son whom Our Lord raised from the dead in Naim after
   his mother had become a widow for the second time. He was the young man
   of Naim who became a disciple and received the name of Martial in
   baptism. Rhoda's daughter Mara, who was present at Mary's death at
   Ephesus, was married and lived near Bethlehem. At the time of Christ's
   birth, when St. Anne absented herself from Bethlehem on one occasion,
   it was to Mara that she went. Mara was not well off, for Rhoda had
   (like the rest of her family) left her children only a third of her
   property, the other two-thirds going to the Temple and the poor. I
   think that Nathanael, the bridegroom of Cana, was a son of this Mara,
   and received the name of Amator in baptism. She had other sons who all
   became disciples.

6. THE HOLY VIRGIN MAKES THE WAY OF THE CROSS FOR THE LAST TIME.

   [August 7, 1821:] Last night and the night before I had much to do with
   the Mother of God at Ephesus. I followed her Way of the Cross with her
   and some five other holy women. The niece of Anna the prophetess was
   there, and also Elizabeth's niece, the widow Mara. The Blessed Virgin
   went in front of them all. I saw that she was weak; her face was quite
   white and as though transparent. Her appearance was indescribably
   moving. It seemed to me as if I were following her here for the last
   time. While she was making the Stations, John, Peter, and Thaddeus were
   I think, already in her house. I saw the Blessed Virgin as very full of
   years, but no sign of old age appeared in her except a consuming
   yearning by which she was as it were transfigured. There was an
   indescribable solemnity about her. I never saw her laugh, though she
   had a beautiful smile. As she grew older, her face became ever paler
   and more transparent. She was very thin, but I saw no wrinkles; there
   was no sign whatever in her of any withering or decay. She was living
   in the spirit, as it were.

   The reason why I saw the Blessed Virgin with such particular clearness
   in this vision may be my possession of a little relic of a garment
   which she wore on this occasion. I will endeavor to describe the
   garment as clearly as I can. [Please refer to Figure 23.] It was an
   over-garment. It completely covered only the back, where it fell to the
   feet in a few long folds. At the neck it was crossed over the breast
   and shoulders, and was held on one shoulder by a button, making a kind
   of scarf. It was fastened round the waist by a girdle and fell from
   under her arms to the feet on each side of the brown undergarment.
   Below the girdle it was folded back to show the lining, which had red
   and yellow stripes running down and across it. The little piece in my
   possession comes from the right-hand side of this fold, but not from
   the lining. It was a festival garment, worn in this way according to
   old Jewish custom. The Blessed Virgin's mother wore one, too. This
   garment covered only the back of the brown undergarment, leaving the
   bodice and whole front of the latter visible. The sleeves, which were
   full, showed only from the elbows downwards. The Blessed Virgin's hair
   was hidden in the yellowish cap which she wore; this was stretched
   rather tightly across her forehead and drawn together in folds on the
   back of her head. Over it she wore a soft black veil which hung down to
   her waist. I saw her wearing this dress at the wedding of Cana. In the
   third year of Jesus' ministry, when Our Lord was healing the sick and
   teaching beyond the Jordan at Bethabara (also called Bethania), I saw
   the Blessed Virgin wearing this dress in Jerusalem, where she was
   living in a beautiful house near the house of Nicodemus, who, I think,
   owned that house also. Again at Our Lord's crucifixion I saw her
   wearing this garment, completely hidden under her praying and mourning
   cloak. No doubt she wore this ceremonial dress here at the Way of the
   Cross in Ephesus in memory of having worn it during Jesus' sufferings
   on His way to Calvary.

   [The morning of August 9 ^th, 1821:] I came into Mary's house, some
   three hours' journey from Ephesus. I saw her lying on a low, very
   narrow couch in her little sleeping-alcove all hung with white, in the
   room behind and to the right of the hearth-place. Her head rested on a
   round cushion. She was very weak and pale, and seemed as though
   completely consumed with yearning. Her head and whole figure were
   wrapped in a long cloth; she was covered by a brown woolen blanket. I
   saw several women (five, I think) going into her room one after the
   other, and coming out again as though they were saying farewell to her.
   As they came out they made affecting gestures of prayer or grief. I
   again noticed amongst them Anna the niece of the prophetess, and Mara,
   Elizabeth's niece, whom I had seen at the Stations of the Cross. I now
   saw six of the Apostles already gathered here--Peter, Andrew, John,
   Thaddeus, Bartholomew, and Matthias--and also one of the seven deacons,
   Nicanor, who was always so helpful and anxious to be of service. I saw
   the Apostles standing in prayer together on the right-hand side of the
   front part of the house, where they had arranged an oratory.

   Figure 23. Mary in her ceremonial dress.

7. TWO APOSTLES HAVE NOT YET ARRIVED.

   [August 10 ^th, 1821:] The time of the year when the Church celebrates
   the death of the Blessed Virgin is no doubt the correct one, only it
   does not fall every year on the same day.

   Today I saw two more Apostles coming in with girt-up garments like
   travelers. [188] These were James the Less and Matthew, who is his
   step-brother, since Alpheus married when a widower Mary the daughter of
   Cleophas, having had Matthew by a former wife.

   Yesterday evening and this morning I saw the assembled Apostles holding
   a service in the front part of the house. For this purpose they had
   taken away or arranged differently the movable wickerwork screens which
   divided it into sleeping compartments. The altar was a table covered
   with a red cloth with a white one over it. It was brought from its
   place to the right of the hearth (which was in daily use) to be set up
   against the wall and used at the service, after which it was put back
   again. In front of the altar was a stand covered with a cloth over
   which hung a scroll. Lamps were burning above the altar. On the altar
   had been placed a vessel in the shape of a cross made of a substance
   lustrous with mother-of-pearl. It was barely nine inches in length and
   breadth and contained five boxes closed by silver lids. In the center
   one was the Blessed Sacrament, and in the others chrism, oil, salt,
   other holy things, and some shreds of what was perhaps cotton.
   Everything was tightly closed and packed together to prevent any
   leakage. It was the Apostles' custom to carry this cross on their
   travels hanging on their breasts under their garments. They were then
   greater than the high priest when he carried on his breast the holy
   treasure of the Old Covenant. I cannot clearly recollect whether there
   were holy bones in one of the boxes or elsewhere. But I do know that in
   the sacrifice of the New Covenant they always had near the altar the
   bones of prophets and later of martyrs, just as the Patriarchs at their
   sacrifices always placed on the altar the bones of Adam or of other
   progenitors on whom the Promise rested. At the Last Supper Christ had
   taught the Apostles to do the same.

   Peter stood in priestly vestments before the altar, with the others
   behind him as if in choir. The women stood in the background.

8. ARRIVAL OF SIMON THE APOSTLE.

   [August 11 ^th, 1821:] Today I saw a ninth Apostle, Simon, arrive.
   James the Greater, Philip and Thomas were the only ones missing. I also
   saw that several disciples had arrived, among whom I remember John Mark
   and the aged Simeon's son or grandson, who had killed Jesus' last
   Easter lamb and had the duty of supervising the sacrificial animals in
   the Temple. There were now some ten men assembled there. There was
   again a service at the altar, and I saw some of the new arrivals with
   their garments girt up high, so that I thought they must be intending
   to leave immediately afterwards. In front of the Blessed Virgin's bed
   stood a small, low, three-cornered stool, like the one on which the
   kings had laid their presents before her in the Cave of the Nativity.
   On it was a little bowl with a small brown transparent spoon. Today I
   saw nobody in the Blessed Virgin's room except one woman.

   I saw Peter again bringing her the Blessed Sacrament after the service;
   he brought it to her in the cross-shaped vessel. The Apostles stood in
   two rows reaching from the altar to her couch, and bowed low as Peter
   passed between them bearing the Blessed Sacrament. The screens round
   the Blessed Virgin's couch were pushed back on all sides.

   After witnessing all this in Ephesus, I had a longing to see what was
   going on in Jerusalem at this time, but shrank from the long journey
   there from Ephesus. Whereupon the holy virgin and martyr Susanna [189]
   came to me and encouraged me, saying that she would be my companion on
   the journey. (Today is her feast day, and I have a relic of her, and
   she was with me the whole night.) So I went with her over sea and land,
   and we soon reached Jerusalem. She was, however, quite different from
   me, as light as air, and when I tried to take hold of her I could not
   do it. As soon as I came to a definite place, as for instance Jerusalem
   yesterday, she disappeared; but in all my passages from one vision to
   another, she was there to accompany and encourage me.

9. JERUSALEM AT THE TIME OF THE DEATH OF THE HOLY VIRGIN.

   I came to the Mount of Olives, and found it all changed and laid waste
   since I had seen it before, though I was able to recognize each place I
   had known. The house near the garden of Gethsemani where the disciples
   had stayed had been pulled down, and a number of trenches and walls had
   been made there to prevent access to it. After this I betook myself to
   Our Lord's Sepulcher. It had been walled up and buried under rubbish,
   and above, on the top of the rock, a building like a little temple was
   being put up. So far only the bare walls had been built. As I looked
   about me, distressed at all the devastation, my heavenly Bridegroom
   appeared to me in the form in which He had once appeared to Mary
   Magdalen in this place, and comforted me.

   I found Mount Calvary built up and desolate. The little hill on which
   the Cross had stood had been leveled and surrounded by banks and
   ditches to prevent access to it. I did, however, make my way there to
   pray, and again Our Lord came to strengthen and comfort me. When Our
   Lord appeared to me I no longer saw St. Susanna beside me.

   Afterwards I entered into a vision of Christ's miracles and acts of
   healing near Jerusalem, and saw many of these healings again. This made
   me think of the power of healing in the name of Jesus which is
   specially bestowed upon priests, and how in our days this grace has
   been particularly manifested in the person of Prince Hohenlohe. [190] I
   saw him healing many kinds of illnesses by his prayers; sometimes he
   cured people who had long suffered from ulcers hidden under their dirty
   rags. I am not sure whether these were really ulcers or only symbols of
   old burdens on their consciences. At the same time I found myself in
   the presence of other priests who possessed this power of healing in
   the same degree, but failed to exercise it owing to distractions,
   preoccupations with other things, fear of other people, or lack of
   perseverance. One of these I saw particularly clearly; to be sure, he
   helped many people whose hearts were, I saw, being gnawed by ugly
   creatures (these, no doubt, signified sins), but others, who lay
   stricken with bodily illness and whom he could certainly have helped,
   he neglected to assist owing to distractions, which caused disturbances
   and obstacles within him.

10. THE APOSTLES HOLD A SERVICE.

   [August 12 ^th, 1821:] There are now not more than twelve men gathered
   together in Mary's house. Today I saw a service being held in her
   sleeping-alcove; Mass was said there. Her little room was open on all
   sides. A woman was kneeling beside Mary's couch and every now and then
   held her upright. I see this being done throughout the day, and I see
   the women giving the Blessed Virgin a spoonful of liquid from the bowl.
   Mary had across on her couch, half an arm's length long and shaped like
   the letter Y, as I always see the Holy Cross. The upright piece is
   somewhat broader than the arms. It seems to be made of different woods,
   and the figure of Christ is white. The Blessed Virgin received the
   Blessed Sacrament. After Christ's Ascension she lived fourteen years
   and two months.

   [As Catherine Emmerich fell asleep that evening, she sang hymns to the
   Mother of God very softly and peacefully in a most moving manner. When
   she woke up again, the writer asked her what she was singing, and she
   answered, still heavy with sleep: I was following in the procession
   with that woman there: now she has gone!' Next day she again spoke of
   this singing. In the evening I was following two of Mary's friends on
   the Way of the Cross behind her house. Every day they take it in turns
   to go there, morning and evening, and I creep up quietly to join in
   behind them. Yesterday I could not help starting to sing and then
   everything was gone.']

   Mary's Way of the Cross has twelve Stations. She paced out all the
   measurements, and John had the memorial stones set up for her. At first
   they were just rough stones to mark the places, afterwards everything
   was made more elaborate. There were now low smooth white stones with
   many sides--I think eight--with a little depression in the center of
   the surface. Each of these stones rested on a base of the same stone
   whose thickness was hidden by the close turf and the beautiful flowers
   surrounding them. The stones and their bases were all inscribed with
   Hebrew letters. These Stations were all in hollows like little round
   basins. They were enclosed, and a path encircled the stones broad
   enough for one or two people to approach in order to read the
   inscriptions. The spaces round the stones, covered with grass and
   beautiful flowers, varied in size. These stones were not always
   uncovered; there was a mat or cover fastened at one side which, when
   nobody was praying there, was pulled over the stone and held down on
   the other side with two pegs. These twelve stones were all alike, all
   engraved with Hebrew inscriptions, but their positions were different.
   The Station of the Mount of Olives was in a little valley near a cave,
   in which several people could kneel at prayer. The Station of Mount
   Calvary was the only one not in a hollow, but on a hill. To reach the
   Station of the Holy Sepulcher one went over this hill and came to the
   stone in a hollow. Still lower down at the foot of the hill, in a cave,
   was the Sepulcher in which the Blessed Virgin was buried. I believe
   that this grave must still exist under the earth and will one day come
   to light.

   I saw that the Apostles, holy women, and other Christians, when they
   approached these Stations to pray before them, kneeling or lying on
   their faces, brought out from under their robes a Y-shaped cross about
   a foot long, which they set up in the hollow on the various stones by
   means of a prop at its back.

11. JAMES THE GREATER AND PHILIP ARRIVE.

   [August 13 ^th, 1821:] I saw the service being celebrated today as
   before. I saw the Blessed Virgin being lifted up several times in the
   day to be given nourishment from the spoon. In the evening about seven
   o'clock she said in her sleep: Now James the Greater has come from
   Spain by Rome with three companions, Timon, Eremenzear, and still
   another.' Later Philip came with a companion from Egypt. I saw the
   Apostles and disciples arrive mostly in a very tired condition. [191]
   They had long staffs with crooks and knobs of different shapes in their
   hands which showed their rank. They wore long white woolen cloaks which
   they could draw over their heads as hoods. Underneath they wore long
   white priests' robes of wool; these were open from top to bottom,
   closed by little knob-like buttons and slit straps of leather. I always
   saw them like this, but forgot to say so. When they were on their
   travels they wore their garments girt up high round their waists. Some
   of them had a pouch hanging from their girdles.

   The newcomers tenderly embraced those who were already there, and I saw
   many of them weeping for joy and for sorrow, too--happy to see each
   other again and grieved that the occasion for their meeting was so sad.
   They laid aside their staffs, cloaks, girdles, and pouches, letting
   their long white undergarments fall to their feet. They put on broad
   girdles which they carried with them, engraved with letters. After
   their feet had been washed, they approached Mary's couch and greeted
   her with reverence. She could only say a few words to them. I saw that
   they took no nourishment except little loaves; they drank from the
   little flasks hanging from their girdles.

12. HOW THE APOSTLES WERE CALLED TO MARY'S DEATHBED.

   A short time before the Blessed Virgin's death, as she felt the
   approach of her reunion with her God, her Son, and her Redeemer, she
   prayed that there might be fulfilled what Jesus had promised to her in
   the house of Lazarus at Bethany on the day before His Ascension. It was
   shown to me in the spirit how at that time, when she begged Him that
   she might not live for long in this vale of tears after He had
   ascended, Jesus told her in general what spiritual works she was to
   accomplish before her end on earth. He told her, too, that in answer to
   her prayers the Apostles and several disciples would be present at her
   death, and what she was to say to them and how she was to bless them. I
   saw, too, how He told the inconsolable Mary Magdalen to hide herself in
   the desert, and her sister Martha to found a community of women; He
   Himself would always be with them.

   After the Blessed Virgin had prayed that the Apostles should come to
   her, I saw the call going forth to them in many different parts of the
   world. At this moment I can remember what follows.

   In many of the places where they had taught, the Apostles had already
   built little churches. Some of them had not yet been built in stone,
   but were made of plaited reeds plastered with clay; yet all those I saw
   had at the back the semicircular or three-sided apse, like Mary's house
   at Ephesus. They had altars in them and offered the holy sacrifice of
   the Mass there.

   I saw all, the farthest as well as the nearest, being summoned by
   visions to come to the Blessed Virgin. The indescribably long journeys
   made by the Apostles were not accomplished without miraculous
   assistance from the Lord. I think that they often traveled in a
   supernatural manner without knowing it, for I often saw them passing
   through crowds of men apparently without anyone seeing them.

   I saw that the miracles which the Apostles worked amongst various
   heathen and savage peoples were quite different from their miracles
   described in Holy Writ. Everywhere they worked miracles according to
   the needs of the people. I saw that they all took with them on their
   travels the bones of the Prophets or of martyrs done to death in the
   first persecutions, and kept them at hand when praying and offering the
   Holy Sacrifice.

   When the Lord's summons to Ephesus came to the Apostles, Peter, and I
   think also Matthias, were in the region of Antioch. Andrew, who was on
   his way from Jerusalem, where he had suffered persecution, was not far
   from him. In the night I saw Peter and Andrew asleep on their journey
   in different places but not very far apart from each other. Neither of
   them were in a town, but were taking their rest in public shelters such
   as are found by the roadside in these hot countries. Peter was lying
   against a wall. I saw a shining youth approach and wake him by taking
   him by the hand and telling him to rise and hurry to Mary, and that he
   would meet Andrew on the way. I saw that Peter, who was already stiff
   from age and his exertions, sat up and rested his hands on his knees as
   he listened to the angel. Hardly had the vision vanished when he got
   up, wrapped himself in his cloak, fastened his girdle, grasped his
   staff, and set forth. He was soon met by Andrew, who had been summoned
   by the same vision; later they met with Thaddeus, to whom the same
   message had been given. Thus all three came to Mary's house, where they
   met John.

   James the Greater, who had a narrow pale face and black hair, came from
   Spain to Jerusalem with several disciples, and stayed some time in
   Sarona near Joppa. It was here that the summons to Ephesus reached him.
   After Mary's death he went with some six others back to Jerusalem and
   suffered a martyr's death. [192] The man who denounced him was
   converted, was baptized by him, and beheaded with him.

   Jude Thaddeus and Simon were in Persia when the summons reached them.

   Thomas was of low stature and had red-brown hair. He was the farthest
   off, and did not arrive until after Mary's death. [193] I saw the
   summoning angel come to him. He was a very long way off. He was not in
   any town, but in a reed-hut, where he was praying, when the angel told
   him to go to Ephesus. I saw him alone in a little boat with a very
   simpleminded servant crossing a wide expanse of water--then journeying
   across country without, I think, touching at any town. He was
   accompanied by a disciple. He was in India when he received the
   warning, but before that he had decided to go farther north to Tartary,
   and could not make up his mind to abandon this plan. (He always tried
   to do too much and so often arrived too late.) So he went still farther
   north, right across China, to where Russia is now, where he received a
   second summons which sent him hurrying to Ephesus. The servant whom he
   had with him was a Tartar whom he had baptized. This man played a part
   in later events, but I forget what it was. Thomas did not return to
   Tartary after Mary's death. He was killed in India by being pierced
   with a lance. I saw that he set up a stone in that country on which he
   knelt and prayed, and that the marks of his knees were imprinted upon
   the stone. He foretold that when the sea should reach this stone,
   another would come to that country preaching Jesus Christ.

   John had been in Jericho a short time before; he often traveled to the
   Promised Land. He usually stayed in Ephesus and its neighborhood, and
   it was here that the summons reached him.

   Bartholomew was in Asia, east of the Red Sea. He was handsome and very
   gifted. His complexion was pale, and he had a high forehead, large
   eyes, and black curly hair. He had a short black curly beard, divided
   in the middle. He had just converted a king and his family. I saw it
   all and will recount it in due course. When he returned there he was
   murdered by the king's brother.

   I forget where James the Less was when the summons reached him. He was
   very handsome and had a great resemblance to Our Lord, whence he was
   called by all his brethren the brother of the Lord.

   About Matthew I again saw today that he was the son of Alpheus by a
   former marriage, and was thus the stepson of Alpheus' second wife Mary,
   the daughter of Cleophas.

   I forget about Andrew.

   Paul was not summoned. Only those were summoned who were relations or
   acquaintances of the Holy Family.

13. THE EFFECT OF RELICS OF THE APOSTLES ON THE VISIONS.

   During these visions I had by my side, amongst the many relics I
   possess, those of Andrew, Bartholomew, James the Greater, James the
   Less, Thaddeus, Simon Zelotes, Thomas, and several disciples and holy
   women. All these came up to me in that order more clearly and
   distinctly than the others, and then entered into the vision that I
   saw. I saw Thomas come up to me like the others, but he did not come
   into the vision of Mary's death; he was far away and came too late. I
   saw that he was the only one of The Twelve who was missing. I saw him
   on his way at a great distance.

   I also saw five disciples, and can remember with particular clearness
   Simeon Justus and Barnabas (or Barsabas), whose bones were beside me.
   [194] Among the three others was one of the shepherd's sons (Eremenzear
   ), who accompanied Jesus on His long journeys after the raising of
   Lazarus. The other two came from Jerusalem. I also saw coming into
   Mary's house Mary Heli, the elder sister of the Blessed Virgin, and her
   younger stepsister, a daughter of Anna by her second husband. Mary Heli
   (who was the wife of Cleophas, the mother of Mary Cleophas, and the
   grandmother of the Apostle James the Less, Thaddeus, and Simon) was by
   then a very old woman. (She was twenty years older than the Blessed
   Virgin.) All these holy women lived near by; they had come here some
   time before to escape the persecution in Jerusalem. Some of them lived
   in caves in the rocks which had been arranged as dwellings by means of
   wickerwork screens.

14. THE DEATH OF THE HOLY VIRGIN.

   [On the afternoon of August 14 ^th Catherine Emmerich said to the
   writer: Now I will tell of the death of the Blessed Virgin if only I am
   not disturbed by visits. Tell my little niece not to interrupt me but
   to wait patiently in the other room for a time.' The writer, having
   done this and returned, said to her, Now tell', whereupon she answered,
   gazing before her with a fixed stare: Where am I, then? Is it morning
   or evening?' The writer: You are going to tell of the death of the
   Blessed Virgin.' Well, there they are, the Apostles, ask them yourself,
   you are much more learned than I am, you can ask them better than I
   can. They are following the Way of the Cross and are preparing the
   grave of the Mother of God.' When she said this, she was already seeing
   what happened after Mary's death. After a pause she continued, marking
   on her fingers the figures she mentioned: See this number, a stroke I
   and then a V, does not this make four? Then again V and three strokes,
   does not that make eight? This is not properly written out; but I see
   them as separate figures because I do not understand big sums in Roman
   letters. It means that the year 48 after Christ's Birth is the year of
   the Blessed Virgin's death. Then I see X and III and then two full
   moons as they are shown in the calendar, that means that the Blessed
   Virgin died thirteen years and two months after Christ's Ascension into
   Heaven. This is not the month in which she died--I think I already saw
   this vision several months ago. Ah, her death was full of sorrow and
   full of joy.' In this continued state of fervor she then recounted the
   following:]

   Yesterday at midday I saw that there was already great grief and
   mourning in the Blessed Virgin's house. Her maidservant was in the
   utmost distress, throwing herself on her knees and praying with
   outstretched arms, sometimes in corners of the house and sometimes
   outside in front of it. The Blessed Virgin lay still and as though near
   death in her little cell. She was completely enveloped in a white
   sleeping coverlet, even her arms being wrapped in it. It was like the
   one I described when she went to bed in Elizabeth's house at the
   Visitation. The veil over her head was arranged in folds across her
   forehead; when speaking with men she lowered it over her face. Even her
   hands were covered except when she was alone. In the last days of her
   life I never saw her take any nourishment except now and then a
   spoonful of juice which her maidservant pressed from a bunch of yellow
   berries like grapes into a bowl near her couch. Towards evening the
   Blessed Virgin realized that her end was approaching and therefore
   signified her desire, in accordance with Jesus' will, to bless and say
   farewell to the Apostles, disciples and women who were present. Her
   sleeping cell was opened on all sides, and she sat upright on her
   couch, shining white as if suffused with light. The Blessed Virgin,
   after praying, blessed each one by laying her crossed hands on their
   foreheads. She then, once more, spoke to them all, doing everything
   that Jesus had commanded her at Bethany. When Peter went up to her, I
   saw that he had a scroll of writing in his hand. She told John what was
   to be done with her body, and bade him divide her clothes between her
   maidservant and another poor girl from the neighborhood who sometimes
   came to help. The Blessed Virgin in saying this pointed to the cupboard
   standing opposite her sleeping cell, and I saw her maidservant go and
   open the cupboard and then shut it again. So I saw all the Blessed
   Virgin's garments and will describe them later. After the Apostles, the
   disciples who were present approached the Blessed Virgin's couch and
   received the same blessing. The men then went back into the front part
   of the house and prepared for the service, while the women who were
   present came up to the Blessed Virgin's couch, knelt down and received
   her blessing. I saw that one of them bent right down over Mary and was
   embraced by her.

   In the meantime the altar was set up and the Apostles vested themselves
   for the service in their long white robes and broad girdles with
   letters on them. Five of them who assisted in offering the Holy
   Sacrifice (just as I had seen done when Peter first officiated in the
   new church at the pool of Bethsaida after the Ascension) put on the
   big, rich, priestly vestments. Peter, who was the celebrant, wore a
   robe which was very long at the back but did not trail on the ground.
   [Please refer to Figure 24.] There must have been some sort of
   stiffening round its hem, for I see it standing out all round.

   They were still engaged in putting on their vestments when James the
   Greater arrived with three companions. He came with Timon the deacon
   from Spain, and after passing through Rome had met with Eremenzear and
   still another. The Apostles already present, who were just going up to
   the altar, greeted him with grave solemnity, telling him in few words
   to go to the Blessed Virgin. He and his companions, after having had
   their feet washed and after arranging their garments, went in their
   traveling dress to the Blessed Virgin's room. She gave her blessing
   first to James alone, and then to his three companions together, after
   which James went to join in the service. The latter had been going on
   for some time when Philip arrived from Egypt with a companion. He at
   once went to the Mother of Our Lord, and wept bitterly as he received
   her blessing.

   In the meantime Peter had completed the Holy Sacrifice. He had
   performed the act of consecration, had received the Body of the Lord,
   and had given Communion to the Apostles and disciples. The Blessed
   Virgin could not see the altar from her bed, but during the Holy
   Sacrifice she sat upright on her couch in deep devotion. Peter, after
   he and the other Apostles had received Communion, brought the Blessed
   Virgin the Blessed Sacrament and administered extreme unction to her.
   The Apostles accompanied him in a solemn procession. Thaddeus went
   first with a smoking censer. Peter bore the Blessed Sacrament in the
   cruciform vessel of which I have spoken, and John followed him,
   carrying a dish on which rested the Chalice with the Precious blood and
   some small boxes. The Chalice was small, white, and thick as though of
   cast metal; its stem was so short that it could only be held with two
   or three fingers. It had a lid, and was of the same shape as the
   Chalice at the Last Supper. A little altar had been set up by the
   Apostles in the alcove beside the Blessed Virgin's couch. The
   maidservant had brought a table which she covered with red and white
   cloths. Lights (I think both tapers and lamps) were burning on it. The
   Blessed Virgin lay back on her pillows pale and still. Her gaze was
   directed intently upwards; she said no word to anyone and seemed in a
   state of perpetual ecstasy. She was radiant with longing; I could feel
   this longing, which was bearing her upwards--ah, my heart was longing
   to ascend with hers to God!

   Figure 24. Peter in rich, priestly vestments.

   Peter approached her and gave her extreme unction, much in the way in
   which it is administered now. From the boxes which John held he
   anointed her with holy oil on her face, hands, and feet, and on her
   side, where there was an opening in her dress so that she was in no way
   uncovered. While this was being done the Apostles were reciting prayers
   as if in choir. Peter then gave her Holy Communion. She raised herself
   to receive it, without supporting herself, and then sank back again.
   The Apostles prayed for a while, and then, raising herself rather less,
   she received the Chalice from John. As she received the Blessed
   Sacrament I saw a radiance pass into Mary, who sank back as though in
   ecstasy, and spoke no more. The Apostles then returned to the altar in
   the front part of the house in a solemn procession with the sacred
   vessels and continued the service. St. Philip now also received Holy
   Communion. Only a few women remained with the Blessed Virgin.

   Afterwards I saw the Apostles and disciples once more standing round
   the Blessed Virgin's bed and praying. Mary's face was radiant with
   smiles as in her youth. Her eyes were raised towards heaven in holy
   joy. Then I saw a wonderfully moving vision. The ceiling of the Blessed
   Virgin's room disappeared, the lamp hung in the open air, and I saw
   through the sky into the heavenly Jerusalem. Two radiant clouds of
   light sank down, out of which appeared the faces of many angels.
   Between these clouds a path of light poured down upon Mary, and I saw a
   shining mountain leading up from her into the heavenly Jerusalem. She
   stretched out her arms towards it in infinite longing, and I saw her
   body, all wrapped up, rise so high above her couch that one could see
   right under it. I saw her soul leave her body like a little figure of
   infinitely pure light, soaring with outstretched arms up the shining
   mountain to heaven. The two angel-choirs in the clouds met beneath her
   soul and separated it from her holy body, which in the moment of
   separation sank back on the couch with arms crossed on the breast.
   [195] My gaze followed her soul and saw it enter the heavenly Jerusalem
   by that shining path and go up to the throne of the most Holy Trinity.
   I saw many souls coming forward to meet her in joy and reverence;
   amongst them I recognized many patriarchs, as well as Joachim, Anna,
   Joseph, Elizabeth, Zechariah, and John the Baptist. The Blessed Virgin
   soared through them all to the Throne of God and of her Son, whose
   wounds shone with a light transcending even the light irradiating His
   whole Presence. He received her with His Divine Love, and placed in her
   hands a scepter with a gesture towards the earth as though indicating
   the power which He gave her. Seeing her thus entered into the glory of
   heaven, I forgot the whole scene round her body on the earth. Some of
   the Apostles, Peter and John for example, must have seen this too, for
   their faces were raised to heaven, while the others knelt, most of them
   bowed down low to the earth. Everywhere was light and radiance, as at
   Christ's Ascension. To my great joy I saw that Mary's soul, as it
   entered heaven, was followed by a great number of souls released from
   purgatory; and again today, on the anniversary, I saw many poor souls
   entering heaven, amongst them some whom I knew. I was given the
   comforting assurance that every year, on the day of the Blessed
   Virgin's death, many souls of those who have venerated her receive this
   reward.

   When I once more looked down to earth, I saw the Blessed Virgin's body
   lying on the couch. It was shining; her face was radiant; her eyes were
   closed, and her arms, crossed on her breast. The Apostles, disciples,
   and women knelt round it praying. As I saw all this there was a
   beautiful ringing in the air and a movement throughout the whole of
   nature like the one I had perceived on Christmas night. The Blessed
   Virgin died after the ninth hour, at the same time as Our Lord.

   The women now laid a covering over the holy body, and the Apostles and
   disciples betook themselves to the front part of the house. The fire on
   the hearth was covered, and all the household utensils put aside and
   covered up. The women wrapped and veiled themselves and, sitting on the
   ground in the room in front of the house, they began to lament for the
   dead, kneeling and sitting in turns. The men muffled their heads in the
   piece of stuff which they wore round their necks and held a mourning
   service. There were always two praying at the head and foot of the holy
   body. Matthew and Andrew followed the Blessed Virgin's Way of the Cross
   till the last Station, the cave which represented Christ's sepulcher.
   They had tools with them with which to enlarge the tomb, for it was
   here that the Blessed Virgin's body was to rest. The cave was not as
   spacious as Christ's and hardly high enough for a man to enter it
   upright. The floor sank at the entrance, and then one saw the
   burial-place before one like a narrow altar with the rock-wall
   projecting over it. The two Apostles did a good deal of work in it, and
   also arranged a door to close the entrance to the tomb. In the
   burial-place a hollow had been made in the shape of a wrapped-up body,
   slightly raised at the head. In front of the cave there was a little
   garden with a wooden fence round it, as there had been in front of
   Christ's sepulcher. Not far away was the Station of Calvary on a hill.
   There was no standing cross there, but only one cut into a stone. It
   must have been half an hour's journey from Mary's house to the tomb.

   Four times did I see the Apostles relieve each other in watching and
   praying by the holy body. Today I saw a number of women, among whom I
   remember a daughter of Veronica and the mother of John Mark, coming to
   prepare the body for burial. They brought with them cloths, as well as
   spices to embalm the body after the Jewish fashion. They all carried
   little pots of fresh herbs. The house was closed and they worked by
   lamplight. The Apostles were praying in the front part of the house as
   though they were in choir. The women took the Blessed Virgin's body
   from her death-bed in its wrappings, and laid it in a long basket which
   was so piled up with thick, roughly woven coverings or mats that the
   body lay high above it. Two women then held a broad cloth stretched
   above the body, while two others removed the head-covering and
   wrappings under this cloth, leaving the body clothed only in the long
   woolen robe. They cut off the Blessed Virgin's beautiful locks of hair
   to be kept in remembrance of her. Then I saw that these two women
   washed the holy body; they had something crinkled in their hands,
   probably sponges. The long robe covering the body was severed. They
   carried out their task with great respect and reverence, washing the
   body with their hands without looking at it, for the cloth which was
   held over it hid it from their eyes. Every place touched by the sponge
   was covered up again at once; the middle of the body remained wrapped
   up and nothing whatever was exposed. A fifth woman wrung out the
   sponges in a bowl and then dipped them into fresh water; three times I
   saw the basin emptied into a hollow outside the house and fresh water
   being brought. The holy body was dressed in a new robe, open in front,
   and reverently lifted, by means of cloths passed under it, onto a table
   where the grave-clothes and swaddling-bands had been arranged for
   convenient use. They wound them tightly round the body from the ankles
   to below the breast, leaving the head, breast, hands, and feet free.

   In the meantime the Apostles had assisted at the Holy Sacrifice offered
   by Peter and received Communion with him, after which I saw Peter and
   John, still in great bishops' cloaks, going from the front part of the
   house to the death chamber. John carried a vessel with ointment, and
   Peter, dipping the finger of his right hand into it, anointed the
   breast, hands, and feet of the Blessed Virgin, praying as he did so.
   (This was not extreme unction; she had received that while still
   alive.) He touched her hands and feet with ointment, marking forehead
   and breast with the sign of the cross. I think that this was done as a
   mark of respect for the holy body, as at the burial of Our Lord. After
   the Apostles had gone away, the women continued their preparation of
   the body for burial. They Lid bunches of myrrh in the arm-pits and
   bosom, and filled with it the spaces between the shoulders and round
   the neck, chin, and checks; the feet, too, were completely embedded in
   bunches of herbs. Then they crossed the arms on the breast, wrapped the
   holy body in a great grave-cloth, and wound it round with a band
   fastened under one arm so that it looked like a child in swaddling
   clothes. A transparent handkerchief was folded back from the face,
   which shone white between the bunches of herbs. They then placed the
   holy body in the coffin which stood near; it was like a bed or a long
   basket. It was a kind of board with a low edge and a slightly arched
   lid. On the breast was laid a wreath of white, red, and sky-blue
   flowers as a token of virginity. The Apostles, disciples, and all
   others present then came in to see the beloved face once more before it
   was covered up. They knelt quietly, shedding many tears, round the
   Blessed Virgin's body, touching Mary's hands wrapped up on her breast
   in farewell, and then went. The holy women, after making their
   farewells, covered the holy face and placed the lid on the coffin,
   which they fastened round with gray bands at each end and in the
   middle. Then I saw the coffin lifted onto a bier and carried out of the
   house on the shoulders of Peter and John. They must have changed
   places, for later on I saw six of the Apostles acting as bearers--at
   the head, James the Greater and James the Less; in the center,
   Bartholomew and Andrew; and behind, Thaddeus and Matthew. There must
   have been a mat or piece of leather attached to the carrying-poles, for
   I saw the coffin hanging between them as if in a cradle. Some of the
   Apostles and disciples went on ahead, others followed with the women.
   It was already dusk, and four lights were carried on poles round the
   coffin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [182] The chronology here is not quite plain. The years given here
   probably include parts of years, since on p. 166 AC states clearly that
   Mary lived fourteen years and two months after the Ascension, or, as on
   p. 169 , thirteen years and two months. If the Ascension took place in
   A.D. 30, the date of the Assumption would be A.D. 43 or 44, which will
   fit with the subsequent martyrdom of James the Great under Herod
   (42-44). See n. 193, p. 167 . If she was then sixty-four years old (as
   AC says here), she was born in 20 B.C. But here there are difficulties
   about other statements: from AC's remarks on p. 98 we can deduce that
   she was eighteen at the birth of Christ, though from p. 57 we gather
   she was fourteen when she left the Temple and was married. The matter
   is also confused by the historical problems of the date of the birth of
   Christ and the date of the Crucifixion and Ascension, and cannot be
   decided with any certainty. (SB)

   [183] None of the apocryphal legends of the Assumption suggest that Our
   Lady lived at Ephesus: most suggest Jerusalem, and the Greek legend (
   John , 4) gives Bethlehem. (SB)

   [184] The road from Jerusalem', one would suppose, would be the main
   road eastwards through Colossae, etc., but the suggestion that Mary's
   house was nearer the sea' than Ephesus (p. 160 ) indicates a road
   southward along the coast. The issue is obscured by AC's supposition
   that Ephesus must be several hours distant from the coast' (ib.). There
   seems to be some geographical confusion here, although the precise
   geographical history of Ephesus is rendered difficult through the
   silting-up of its harbor. (SB)

   [185] These visits to Jerusalem may be the source of the legends that
   suppose her death to have taken place there. Several, the Latin (3),
   the Greek (3), and Pseudo-Joseph of Arimathea (4), refer to her visit
   to the sepulcher. The Council cannot be that of Acts 15, which took
   place some years later. (SB)

   [186] Her tomb at Gethsemani is mentioned in the Greek legend (48). The
   others indicate the Vale of Josaphat, usually identified with the
   Kedron Valley between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives. Gethsemani is
   on one side of the valley. (SB)

   [187] St. John Damascene, a monk at Jerusalem, died c. A.D. 754, and is
   a Doctor of the Church. His sermon ( 2 de Dormitione Deiparae) relates
   her burial at Jerusalem. It is recited in the Breviary on the
   Octave-Day or during the Octave, and is in fact the simplest collection
   of popular legends about the Assumption. (SB)

   [188] AC's matter-of-fact account of the arrival of the Apostles (and
   cf. p. 167 on their tiredness) contrasts strikingly with that of the
   legends. In most of these the Apostles are transported by clouds to
   Mary's deathbed, and in the Syriac legend some are already dead and
   come to life for the occasion. (SB)

   [189] St. Susanna was a Roman maiden, martyred in AD. 295. (SB)

   [190] Prince Alexander Leopold Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfuürst
   was born in 1794. Ordained priest in 1815, he became a canon of Bamberg
   in 1821. About this time he began to perform some remarkable miraculous
   cures. The most outstanding was that performed on June 21st, 1821, when
   Princess Mathilda von Schwarzenberg was released from her paralysis of
   the previous eight years. The date at the heading of this section of
   AC's statement shows that she was speaking less than two months after
   this event, which therefore had a great topical interest. The holy man
   became a titular bishop in 1844 and died in 1849. (SB)

   [191] The mission-fields of the various Apostles as mentioned by AC on
   these pages generally correspond to the traditional legends as
   preserved in the Lives of the Saints, the Breviary, the Acta
   Bollandiana, and local cult. Timon was one of the seven deacons ( Acts
   6.15), and is so called by AC (infra, p. 169 ). The identity of
   Eremenzear is unknown, but AC 169 states (p. 168 ) that he joined James
   and Timon later and had been a disciple of Our Lord. (SB)

   [192] The martyrdom of James the Great is the only death of an Apostle
   narrated in the New Testament ( Acts 12.1), and the persecutor is
   named: Herod, i.e. Herod Agrippa I. This Herod reigned AD. 42-44. AC
   suggests that James went directly to his martyrdom after the
   Assumption, in which case the Assumption must have taken place in AD.
   44 at the latest. (SB)

   [193] The late arrival of Thomas is included in the tradition preserved
   by St. John Damascene, but among the early legends only in that
   entitled of Joseph of Arimathea' (17). It might easily be supposed to
   be invented in view of John 20.24, but it might equally easily be
   supposed to be truly in character. (SB)

   [194] Simeon Justus and Barnabas or Barsabas. There may be a confusion
   here (unless other persons are intended): Joseph Barsabas Justus was
   the candidate proposed with Matthias in Acts 1.23; Joseph Barnabas,
   later the companion of St. Paul, first appears in Acts 4.36. (SB)

   [195] All the ancient legends describe the pure soul of Mary leaving
   her body. The dogmatic decree of Nov. 1st, 1950, however, makes no
   pronouncement about the death of Our Lady. It is worth here quoting the
   actual definition: "Immaculatam Deiparam semper Virginem Mariam,
   expleto terrestris vitae cursu, fuisse corpore et anima ad caelestem
   gloriam assumptam." -- " That Mary, the Immaculate and ever Virgin
   Mother of God, at the end of the course of her life on earth, was taken
   up, body and soul, into the glory of heaven." (SB)

              XIX. THE BURIAL AND ASSUMPTION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN

   The funeral procession followed the Way of the Cross set up by the
   Blessed Virgin right up to the last Station, and then went over the
   hill in front of that Station and stopped at the right of the entrance
   to the tomb. Here they laid down the holy body, and then four of them
   carried it into the burial-chamber in the rock and laid it in the place
   hollowed out for it. All those present went in one by one and laid
   spices and flowers beside the body, kneeling down and offering up their
   prayers and their tears.

   Many lingered there in love and sorrow, and night had fallen when the
   Apostles closed the entrance to the tomb. They dug a trench before the
   narrow entrance of the rock-tomb, and planted in it a hedge of various
   shrubs brought with their roots from elsewhere. Some had leaves, some
   blossoms, and some berries. They made the water from a near-by spring
   flow in front of the hedge, so that no trace of the entrance to the
   tomb could be seen and none could enter the cave without forcing a way
   round behind the hedge. They went away in scattered groups, some
   remaining to pray and watch by the tomb, others stopping to pray here
   and there at the Stations of the Cross. Those who were on their way
   home saw from the distance a strange radiance over Mary's tomb, which
   moved them to wonder, though they did not know what it really was. I
   saw it, too, but of all that I saw I remember only the following. It
   was as if a shaft of light descended from heaven towards the tomb, and
   in this shaft was a lovely form like the soul of the Blessed Virgin,
   accompanied by the form of Our Lord. Then the body of the Blessed
   Virgin, united to the shining soul, rose shining out of the grave and
   soared up to heaven with the figure of Our Lord. All this lies in my
   memory as something half realized and yet distinct.

   In the night I saw several of the Apostles and holy women praying and
   singing in the little garden in front of the rock-tomb. A broad shaft
   of light came down from heaven to the rock, and I saw descending in it
   a triple-ringed glory of angels and spirits surrounding the appearance
   of Our Lord and of the shining soul of Mary. The appearance of Jesus
   Christ, whose wound-marks were streaming with light, moved down in
   front of her soul. Round the soul of Mary, in the innermost circle of
   the glory, I saw only little figures of children; in the midmost circle
   they appeared as six-year-old children; and in the outermost circle as
   grown-up youths. I could see only the faces clearly, all the rest I saw
   as shimmering figures of light. As this vision, becoming ever clearer,
   streamed down upon the rock, I saw a shining path opened and leading up
   to the heavenly Jerusalem. Then I saw the soul of the Blessed Virgin,
   which had been following the appearance of Jesus, pass in front of Him,
   and float down into the tomb. Soon afterwards I saw her soul, united to
   her transfigured body, rising out of the tomb far brighter and clearer,
   and ascending into the heavenly Jerusalem with Our Lord and with the
   whole glory. Thereupon all the radiance faded again, and the quiet
   starry sky covered the land.

   I do not know whether the Apostles and holy women praying before the
   tomb saw all this in the same manner, but I saw them looking upwards in
   adoration and amazement, or throwing themselves down full of awe with
   their faces to the ground. I saw, too, how several of those who were
   praying and singing by the Way of the Cross as they carried home the
   empty bier turned back with great reverence and devotion towards the
   light above the rock-tomb.

   Thus I did not see the Blessed Virgin die in the usual manner, nor did
   I see her go up to heaven; but I saw that first her soul and then her
   body were taken from the earth.

   On returning to the house the Apostles and disciples partook of a
   little food and then went to rest. They slept outside the house in
   sheds built onto it. Mary's maidservant, who had remained in the house
   to set things in order, and the other women who had stayed there to
   help her, slept in the room behind the hearth. During the burial the
   maidservant had cleared everything out of this, so that it now looked
   like a little chapel; and thenceforward the Apostles used it for prayer
   and for offering the Holy Sacrifice. This evening I saw them still in
   their own room, praying and mourning. The women had already gone to
   rest. Then I saw the Apostle Thomas and two companions, all girt up,
   arrive at the gate of the courtyard and knock to be let in. There was a
   disciple with him called Jonathan, who was related to the Holy Family.
   [196] His other companion was a very simple-minded man from the land of
   the farthest of the three holy kings, which I always call Partherme,
   [197] not being able to recall names exactly. Thomas had brought him
   from there; he carried his cloak and was an obedient, child-like
   servant. A disciple opened the gate, and Thomas went with Jonathan into
   the Apostles' room, telling his servant to sit at the gate and wait.
   The good brown man, who did everything that he was told, at once sat
   quietly down. O, how distressed they were to learn that they had come
   too late! Thomas cried like a child when he heard of Mary's death. The
   disciples washed his and Jonathan's feet, and gave them some
   refreshment. In the meantime the women had woken and got up, and when
   they had retired from the Blessed Virgin's room, Thomas and Jonathan
   were taken to the place where the Blessed Virgin had died. They threw
   themselves to the ground and watered it with their tears. Thomas knelt
   long in prayer at Mary's little altar. His grief was inexpressibly
   moving; it makes me cry even now when I think of it. When the Apostles
   had finished their prayers (which they had not interrupted), they all
   went to welcome the new arrivals. They took Thomas and Jonathan by the
   arms, lifted them from their knees, embraced them, and led them into
   the front part of the house, where they gave them honey and little
   loaves of bread to eat. They drank from little jugs and goblets. They
   prayed together once more, and all embraced each other.

   But now Thomas and Jonathan begged to be shown the tomb [198] of the
   Blessed Virgin, so the Apostles kindled lights fastened to staves, and
   they all went out along Mary's Way of the Cross to her tomb. They spoke
   little, stopping for a short time at the stones of the Stations, and
   meditating on the Via Dolorosa of Our Lord and the compassionate love
   of His Mother, who had placed these stones of remembrance here and had
   so often wetted them with her tears. When they came to the rock-tomb,
   they all threw themselves on their knees. Thomas and Jonathan hurried
   towards the tomb, followed by John. Two disciples held back the bushes
   from the entrance, and they went in and knelt in reverent awe before
   the resting-place of the Blessed Virgin. John then drew near to the
   light wicker coffin, which projected a little beyond the ledge of rock,
   undid the three gray bands which were round it and laid them aside.
   When the light of the torches shone into the coffin, they saw with awe
   and amazement the grave-clothes lying before them still wrapped round
   as before, but empty. About the face and breast they were undone; the
   wrappings of the arms lay slightly loosened, but not unwound. The
   transfigured body of Mary was no longer on earth. They gazed up in
   astonishment, raising their arms, as though the holy body had only then
   vanished from among them; and John called to those outside the cave:
   Come, see, and wonder, she is no longer here.' All came two by two into
   the narrow cave, and saw with amazement the empty grave-clothes lying
   before them. They looked up to heaven with uplifted arms, weeping and
   praying, praising the Lord and His beloved transfigured Mother (their
   true dear Mother, too) like devoted children, uttering every kind of
   loving endearment as the spirit moved them. They must have remembered
   in their thoughts that cloud of light which they had seen from afar on
   their way home immediately after the burial, how it had sunk down upon
   the tomb and then soared upwards again. John took the Blessed Virgin's
   grave-clothes with great reverence out of the wicker coffin, folded and
   wrapped them carefully together, and took them away, after closing the
   lid of the coffin and fastening it again with the bands. Then they left
   the tomb, closing the entrance again with the bushes. They returned to
   the house by the Way of the Cross, praying and singing hymns. On their
   return they all went into the Blessed Virgin's room. John laid the
   grave-clothes reverently on the little table before the place where the
   Blessed Virgin used to pray. Thomas and the others prayed again at the
   place where she died. Peter went apart as if in spiritual meditation;
   perhaps he was making his preparation, for afterwards I saw the altar
   being set up before the Blessed Virgin's place of prayer where her
   cross stood, and I saw Peter holding a solemn service there, the others
   standing behind him in rows and praying and singing alternately. The
   holy women stood farther back by the doors, behind the hearth.

   Thomas' simple-minded servant had followed him from the distant land
   which he had last visited. His appearance was very strange. He had
   small eyes, a flat forehead and nose, and high cheek-bones. His skin
   was of a browner color than one sees here. He had been baptized; apart
   from that he was just like an ignorant, obedient child. He did
   everything that he was told--stood still where he was put, looked in
   the direction he was told to, and smiled at everybody. He remained
   seated in the place where Thomas had said he was to wait, and when he
   saw Thomas in tears, he wept bitterly, too. This man always stayed with
   Thomas; he was able to carry great weights, and I have seen him
   dragging up enormous stones when Thomas was building a chapel.

   After the Blessed Virgin's death I saw the assembled Apostles and
   disciples often standing together in a group and telling each other
   where they had been and what had befallen them. I heard it all, and if
   it be God's will I shall recollect it.

   [August 20 ^th, 1820 and 1821:] After performing various devotions most
   of the disciples have taken leave and returned to their duties. The
   Apostles are still at the house, with Jonathan, who came with Thomas,
   and also Thomas' servant; but they will all be leaving as soon as they
   have finished their work. They are working at freeing Mary's Way of the
   Cross from weeds and stones and are planting it with beautiful shrubs,
   herbs, and flowers. While working they pray and sing, and I cannot
   express how moving it is to see them: it is as if, in their love and
   sorrow, they were performing a solemn religious service, sad but
   beautiful. Like devoted children they adorn the footsteps of God's
   Mother and their Mother--those footsteps which followed, in
   compassionate devotion, her Divine Son's path of suffering to His
   redeeming death upon the Cross.

   They entirely closed up the entrance into Mary's tomb by earthing up
   more firmly the bushes planted in front of it and strengthening the
   trench. They arranged and beautified the little garden before the tomb,
   and dug out a passage at the back of the hill leading to the back wall
   of the tomb, chiseling out an opening in the rock through which one
   could see the place where the Holy Mother's body had rested--that
   Mother whom the Redeemer, when dying on the Cross, had entrusted to
   John and thus, to them all and to His Church. O, they were true and
   faithful sons, obedient to the Fourth Commandment, and long will they
   and their love live upon the land! Above the tomb they made a kind of
   tent-chapel with carpets; it had wattle walls and roof. They built a
   little altar in it, with a stone step and a big flat stone supported on
   another stone. Against the wall behind this altar they hung a little
   carpet on which the picture of the Blessed Virgin had been woven or
   embroidered, very plainly and simply. It was in bright colors, showing
   her in festal attire, brown with blue and red stripes. When all was
   finished they held a service there, all praying on their knees with
   uplifted hands. They made Mary's room in the house into a church.
   Mary's maidservant and a few women continued to live in the house; and
   two of the disciples, one of whom came from the shepherds beyond the
   Jordan, were left here to provide for the spiritual comfort of the
   faithful living in the neighborhood.

   Soon afterwards the Apostles separated to go their different ways.
   Bartholomew, Simon, Jude, Philip, and Matthew were the first to leave
   for the countries of their missions, after taking a moving farewell of
   the others. The others, except John, who stayed on for a while, went
   all together to Palestine before separating. There were many disciples
   there, and several women went with them from Ephesus to Jerusalem. Mary
   Mark did much for the Christians there; she had established a community
   of some twenty women who to a certain extent led a conventual life.
   Five of them lived in her own house, which was a regular meeting-place
   for the disciples. [199] The Christians still owned the church at the
   Pool of Bethsaida.

   [On August 22 ^nd she said:] John is the only one left in the house.
   All the others have already gone. I saw John carrying out the Blessed
   Virgin's wishes and dividing her clothes between her maidservant and
   another girl who sometimes came to help her. Some of the stuffs given
   by the three holy kings were among them. I saw two long white robes and
   several long cloaks and veils, as well as coverings and carpets. I also
   saw quite clearly that striped over-dress which she wore at Cana and on
   the Way of the Cross--the one of which I possess a little strip. Some
   of these things became the property of the Church; for instance, the
   beautiful sky-blue wedding-dress, ornamented with gold thread and
   strewn with embroidered roses, was made into a vestment for the Holy
   Sacrifice for the Bethsaida church in Jerusalem. There are relics of it
   in Rome still. I see them, but do not know if they are recognized
   there. Mary wore it only for her wedding and never again.

   All that I have described happened in stillness and quiet. There was
   secrecy but (unlike today) no fear. Persecution had not yet reached the
   stage of spies and informers, and there was nothing to disturb the
   serenity and peace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [196] She recognized this disciple by a relic of him which was in her
   possession but had no name on it. She said of him on July 25th and
   26th, 1821 Jonathan or Jonadab received the name of Elieser in baptism.
   He was of the tribe of Benjamin and came from the region of Samaria. He
   was with Peter and then with Paul, but was too slow for him he was also
   with John, and came with Thomas from far away at Our Lady's death. He
   was, like Thomas' simple Tartar servant, very childish in character,
   but became a priest. I saw him still here in Ephesus three years after
   Mary's death. Later I saw him left lying here, stoned and half dead,
   and then taken into the city, where he died. Afterwards his bones were
   brought to Rome, but his identity remained unknown. (CB) This Jonathan
   or Jonadab is not identifiable in any available document.

   [197] Partherme was indicated before (p. 114 ) as the land of Seir,
   though the land of Theokeno, Media, was stated (ibid.) to be the
   remotest. (SB)

   [198] Thomas' late arrival was the immediate occasion of Our Lady's
   tomb being opened and found empty. This is also a feature of the
   general legend preserved by St. John Damascene and recited in the
   Breviary. (SB)

   [199] Mary Mark's house at Jerusalem, a meeting-place for disciples,
   was the natural place for Peter to go to after his escape from prison (
   Acts 12.12). It is evident that this event was after the Assumption,
   because Peter's arrest was part of the same persecution which caused
   the martyrdom of James the Great ( Acts 12.1) which, according to AC,
   happened after his return to Jerusalem from Ephesus (supra, p. 167 ).
