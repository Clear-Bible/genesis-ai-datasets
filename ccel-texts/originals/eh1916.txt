Preface

   The General Convention of the year 1913 entrusted to a Commission the
   revision of the Hymnal. The General Convention of 1916, accepting a
   book then submitted, referred it back to the Commission with
   instructions to perfect it and give it to the Church. In its effort to
   obey this command, the Commission now presents this book.

   Some hymns which were in the former collection have been omitted
   because it was discovered by careful inquiry that they were seldom if
   ever used. One of the principles of the revision was to make the new
   book as compact as excellence and variety would permit. Some old hymns
   which are perhaps below the general standard are retained because they
   have the affection of a considerable number of people.

   The hymns added find a place either because they are great religious
   verse, or because they express the experience and aspirations of our
   time. These are hymns intended to voice our yearning for larger social
   service, for deeper patriotism, for a more eager obligation to the
   winning and maintaining of a free world, for a higher enthusiasm
   towards the unity and extension of Christianity. This Hymnal of 1918
   cannot escape the marks of the Great War, -- its tragedy, its sympathy,
   its loving sacrifice, its gratitude because God has given us the
   victory for the right and the true.

   The hymns have been arranged as nearly as possible in the Prayer Book
   order, with the hope that people will recognize that they have a
   companion for the Book of Common Prayer in a Book of Common Praise.

   The Commission has tried to retain and to add such hymns as express
   reality in the religious life. At the same time there has been generous
   thought for a wide diversity of temperament and training. From stern
   simplicity to exuberant emotion, the ways in which men would praise God
   are manifold. Accordingly there are hymns of objective adoration,
   august and distant, side by side with hymns which unburden the singer's
   heart and tell what God has done for him alone.

   The members of the Commission charged with the task of selecting the
   music of the hymns have tried first of all to select music which
   congregations as well as choristers can sing. The number of sentimental
   and weak melodies has been reduced. It is hoped that the many fine new
   tunes will so far win their way that such inferior music as is retained
   will lose its attraction. By such additions as certain Plainsong
   settings and tunes for adult male voices, the effort is made to appeal
   to various temperaments and abilities. No one parish will care to use
   all the tunes, but out of the book every parish will find a sufficient
   number for all its needs, which it can sing with enthusiasm. As with
   the words, so with the music, the Commission has endeavoured to provide
   a book which will make our Communion a singing Church.

   The prayer which goes up with the finishing of the book is that, in
   spite of its limitations and imperfections, it may bring the Church
   into greater joy, as the people sing these hymns of the ages to the
   grateful honor of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
   God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost.

  Note

   "Amen" is printed only with those hymns which are prayer, praise, or
   otherwise addressed to God. Nevertheless, the necessary music for
   "Amen" has been supplied throughout, for the use of those who desire
   it.

   The dates throughout this book are arranged as follows, both for the
   Hymns and the Tunes. A single date, without a hyphen, is the earliest
   obtainable for the given Hymn or Tune: whether of composition, or of
   first publication. When such a date is wanting, the dates of the
   author's or composer's birth and death are given, separated by a
   hyphen. A date followed by a hyphen is that of birth; preceded by a
   hyphen, or by the letter d, is that of death. The letter c. (circa),
   indicates an approximate date.

   When no composer is known, the place and date of publication are given
   when possible.

     __________________________________________________________________

      [10]Daily Prayer: Morning

1. New every morning is the love

   L.M.

   [11]Melcombe:

   Samuel Webbe, 1782

   John Keble, 1822


   New every morning is the love

   Our wakening and uprising prove;

   Through sleep and darkness safely brought,

   Restored to life, and power, and thought.


   New mercies, each returning day,

   Hover around us while we pray;

   New perils past, new sins forgiven,

   New thoughts of God, new hopes of heaven.


   If on our daily course our mind

   Be set to hallow all we find,

   New treasures still, of countless price,

   God will provide for sacrifice.


   Old friends, old scenes, will lovelier be,

   As more of heaven in each we see;

   Some softening gleam of love and prayer

   Shall dawn on every cross and care.


   The trivial round, the common task,

   Will furnish all we ought to ask;

   Room to deny ourselves, a road

   To bring us daily nearer God.


   Seek we no more; content with these,

   Let present rapture, comfort, ease, --

   As heaven shall bid them, come and go:

   The secret this of rest below.


   Only, O Lord, in thy dear love,

   Fit us for perfect rest above;

   And help us, this and every day,

   To live more nearly as we pray.


   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

      [12]Daily Prayer: Morning

2. Awake, my soul, and with the sun

   L.M.

   [13]Morning Hymn:

   Francois Barthelemon, 1785

PART II.

   Thomas Ken, 1695;

   rev., 1709


   Awake, my soul, and with the sun

   Thy daily stage of duty run;

   Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise

   To pay thy morning sacrifice.


   Redeem thy misspent moments past;

   And live this day as if thy last:

   Improve thy talent with due care;

   For the great Day thyself prepare.


   Let all thy converse be sincere,

   Thy conscience as the noonday clear;

   Think how allseeing God thy ways

   And all thy secret thoughts surveys.


   Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart,

   And with the angels bear thy part,

   Who all night long unwearied sing

   High praise to the eternal King.


   All praise to thee, who safe hast kept

   And hast refreshed me while I slept;

   Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake,

   I may of endless light partake.


   Lord, I my vows to thee renew;

   Scatter my sins as morning dew;

   Guard my first springs of thought and will,

   And with thyself my spirit fill.


   Direct, control, suggest, this day,

   All I design, or do, or say;

   That all my powers, with all their might,

   In thy sole glory may unite.


   Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;

   Praise him, all creatures here below;

   Praise him above, angelic host;

   Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.


   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

      [14]Daily Prayer: Morning

3. Come, my soul, thou must be waking

   8.4.7.8.4.7

   [15]Haydn:

   arr. from Franz Joseph Haydn, 1791

   [16]Carman:

   Peter C. Lutkin, 1895

   German, F. R. L. Canitz (1654-1699);

   Tr. Henry J. Buckoll, 1838


   Come, my soul, thou must be waking.

   Now is breaking

   O'er the earth another day:

   Come, to him who made this splendor,

   See thou render

   All thy feeble strength can pay.


   Gladly hail the sun returning,

   Ready burning

   Be the incense of thy powers;

   For the night is safely ended,

   God hath tended

   With his care thy helpless hours.


   Pray that he may prosper ever

   Each endeavor,

   When thine aim is good and true;

   And that he may ever thwart thee,

   And convert thee,

   When thou evil wouldst pursue.


   Think that he thy ways beholdeth;

   He unfoldeth

   Every fault that lurks within;

   He the hidden shame glossed over

   Can discover,

   And discern each deed of sin.


   Mayest thou on life's last morrow,

   Free from sorrow,

   Pass away in slumber sweet;

   And, released from death's dark sadness,

   Rise in gladness

   That far brighter Sun to greet.


   Only God's free gifts abuse not,

   Light refuse not,

   But his Spirit's voice obey;

   Thou with him shalt dwell, beholding

   Light enfolding

   All things in unclouded day.
     __________________________________________________________________

      [17]Daily Prayer: Morning

4. Christ, whose glory fills the skies

   Six 7's

   [18]Ratisbon:

   Werner's Choralbuch, 1815

   Charles Wesley, 1740


   Christ, whose glory fills the skies,

   Christ, the true, the only Light,

   Sun of Righteousness, arise!

   Triumph o'er the shades of night:

   Day-spring from on high, be near;

   Day-star, in my heart appear.


   Dark and cheerless is the morn

   Unaccompanied by thee;

   Joyless is the day's return,

   Till thy mercy's beams I see;

   Till they inward light impart,

   Glad my eyes, and warm my heart.


   Visit then this soul of mine!

   Pierce the gloom of sin and grief!

   Fill me, Radiancy divine;

   Scatter all my unbelief,

   More and more thyself display,

   Shining to the perfect day.


   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

      [19]Daily Prayer: Morning

5. Now that the sun is gleaming bright

   C.M.

   [20]St. Peter:

   Alexander R. Reinagle, 1836

   Latin;

   Tr. John Henry Newman (1836-1838)


   Now that the sun is gleaming bright,

   Implore we, bending low,

   That he, the uncreated Light

   May guide us as we go.


   No sinful word, nor deed of wrong,

   Nor thoughts that idly rove,

   But simple truth be on our tongue,

   And in our hearts be love.


   And while the hours in order flow,

   O Christ, securely fence

   Our gates, beleaguered by the foe,

   The gate of every sense.


   And grant that to thine honor, Lord,

   Our daily toil may tend;

   That we begin it at thy word,

   And in thy favor end.


   Amen.

6. My Father, for another night

   C.M.

   [22]St. Timothy:

   Henry W. Baker, 1875

   Henry W. Baker, 1875


   My Father, for another night

   Of quiet sleep and rest,

   For all the joy of morning light,

   Thy holy Name be blest.


   Now with the newborn day I give

   Myself anew to thee,

   That as thou willest I may live,

   And what thou willest be.


   Whate'er I do, things great or small,

   Whate'er I speak or frame,

   Thy glory may I seek in all,

   Do all in Jesus' Name.


   My Father, for his sake, I pray

   Thy child accept and bless;

   And lead me by thy grace today

   In paths of righteousness.


   Amen.

7. Forth in thy Name, O Lord, I go

   L.M.

   [24]Pixham:

   Horatio Parker, 1901

   Charles Wesley, 1749


   Forth in thy Name, O Lord, I go

   My daily labour to pursue;

   Thee, only thee, resolved to know,

   In all I think, or speak, or do.


   The task thy wisdom hath assigned,

   O let me cheerfully fulfill;

   In all my works thy presence find,

   And prove thy good and perfect will.


   Thee may I set at my right hand,

   Whose eyes my inmost substance see:

   And labour on at thy command,

   And offer all my works to thee.


   Give me to bear thy easy yoke,

   And every moment watch and pray;

   And still to things eternal look,

   And hasten to thy glorious Day.


   Fain would I still for thee employ

   Whate'er thy bounteous grace hath given,

   Would run my course with even joy

   And closely walk with thee to heaven.


   Amen.

   [26]Ludborough:

   Timothy R. Matthews, 1846

   Latin; St. Ambrose (340-397);

   Tr. John Henry Newman, 1836


   Come, Holy Ghost, who ever One

   Art with the Father and the Son;

   Come, Holy Ghost, our souls possess

   With thy full flood of holiness.


   In will and deed, by heart and tongue,

   With all our powers, thy praise be sung;

   And love light up our mortal frame,

   Till others catch the living flame.


   Almighty Father, hear our cry

   Through Jesus Christ our Lord most high,

   Who with the Holy Ghost and thee

   Doth live and reign eternally.

      [29]Daily Prayer: Noon

9. Blest are the moments, doubly blest

   L.M.

   [30]Wareham:

   William Knapp, 1738

   William Wordsworth, 1834


   Blest are the moments, doubly blest,

   That drawn from this one hour of rest,

   Are with a ready heart bestowed

   Upon the service of our God!


   Each field is then a hallowed spot,

   An altar is in each man's cot,

   A church in every grove that spreads

   Its living roof above our heads.


   Look up to heaven, the industrious sun

   Already half his race hath run:

   He cannot halt or go astray,

   But our immortal spirits may.


   Lord, since his rising in the east,

   If we have faltered or transgressed,

   Guide, from thy love's abundant source,

   What yet remains of this day's course;


   Help with thy grace, through life's short day,

   Our upward and our downward way;

   And glorify for us the west,

   When we shall sink to final rest.


   Amen.

10. Behold us, Lord, a little space

   C.M.

   [32]Bedford:

   William Wheall, c. 1720

   John Ellerton, 1870


   Behold us, Lord, a little space

   From daily tasks set free,

   And met within thy holy place

   To rest awhile with thee.


   Around us rolls the ceaseless tide

   Of business, toil, and care;

   And scarcely can we turn aside

   For one brief hour of prayer.


   Yet these are not the only walls

   Wherein thou mayst be sought;

   On homeliest work thy blessing falls,

   In truth and patience wrought.


   Thine is the loom, the forge, the mart,

   The wealth of land and sea,

   The worlds of science and of art,

   Revealed and ruled by thee.


   Then let us prove our heavenly birth,

   In all we do and know;

   And claim the kingdom of the earth

   For thee and not thy foe.


   Work shall be prayer, if all be wrought

   As thou wouldst have it done,

   And prayer, by thee inspired and taught,

   Itself with work be one.


   Amen.

   Six 10's

   [68]Nachtlied:

   Henry Smart, 1872

   Christopher Wordsworth, 1863


   The day is gently sinking to a close,

   Fainter and yet more faint the sunlight glows.

   O Brightness of thy Father's glory, thou

   Eternal Light of Light, be with us now.

   Where thou art present darkness cannot be;

   Midnight is glorious noon, O Lord, with thee.


   Our changeful lives are ebbing to an end;

   Onward to darkness and to death we tend.

   O Conqueror of the grave, be thou our guide,

   Be thou our light in death's dark eventide;

   Then in our mortal hour will be no gloom,

   No sting in death, no terror in the tomb.


   Thou, who in darkness walking didst appear

   Upon the waves, and thy disciples cheer,

   Come, Lord, in lonesome days, when storms assail,

   And earthly hopes and human succours fail.

   When all is dark may we behold thee nigh,

   And hear thy voice: "Fear not, for it is I."


   The weary world is mouldering to decay,

   Its glories wane, its pageants fade away;

   In that last sunset when the stars shall fall,

   May we arise awakened by thy call,

   With thee, O Lord, for ever to abide

   In that blest day which has no eventide.

   Godfrey Thring, 1864


   The radiant morn hath passed away,

   And spent too soon her golden store;

   The shadows of departing day

   Creep on once more.


   Our life is but an autumn sun,

   Its glorious noon, how quickly past;

   Lead us, O Christ, our lifework done,

   Safe home at last.


   O by thy soul-inspiring grace,

   Uplift our hearts to realms on high;

   Help us to look to that bright place

   Beyond the sky,


   Where light, and life, and joy, and peace

   In undivided empire reign,

   And thronging angels never cease

   Their deathless strain;


   Where saints are clothed in spotless white.

   And evening shadows never fall,

   Where thou, eternal Light of Light,

   Art Lord of all.

   [76]St. Columba (Irons):

   Herbert S. Irons, 1861

   Latin;

   Tr. Edward Caswall, 1858


   The sun is sinking fast,

   As Christ upon the cross

   His head inclined,

   And to his Father's hands

   His parting soul resigned;


   So now herself my soul

   Would wholly give

   Into his sacred charge,

   In whom all spirits live;


   So now beneath his eye

   Would calmly rest,

   Without a wish or thought

   Abiding in the breast;


   Save that his will be done,

   Whate'er betide;

   Dead to herself, and dead

   In him to all beside.


   Thus would I live; yet now

   Not I, but he,

   In all his power and love,

   Henceforth alive in me.


   One sacred Trinity,

   One Lord divine,

   May I be ever his,

   And he for ever mine.

   Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;

   The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide:

   When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,

   Help of the helpless, O abide with me.


   Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;

   Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away,

   Change and decay in all around I see;

   O thou who changest not, abide with me.


   I need thy presence every passing hour;

   What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?

   Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?

   Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.


   I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless:

   Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.

   Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?

   I triumph still, if thou abide with me.


   Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes:

   Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:

   Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee:

   In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

   Softly now the light of day

   Naught escapes, without, within,

   Pardon each infirmity,

   Open fault, and secret sin.


   Soon, for me, the light of day

   [82]Hursley:

   John Keble, 1820


   Sun of my soul, thou Savior dear,

   It is not night if thou be near;

   To hide thee from thy servant's eyes.


   When the soft dews of kindly sleep

   My weary eyelids gently steep,

   For ever on my Savior's breast.


   Abide with me from morn till eve,

   For without thee I cannot live;

   Abide with me when night is nigh,

   For without thee I dare not die.


   If some poor wandering child of thine

   Have spurned today the voice divine,

   Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;

   Let him no more lie down in sin.


   Watch by the sick; enrich the poor

   With blessings from thy boundless store;

   Be every mourner's sleep tonight,

   Like infant's slumbers, pure and light.


   Come near and bless us when we wake,

   Ere through the world our way we take,

   Till in the ocean of thy love

   We lose ourselves in heaven above.

   [87]St. Leonard (Giles):

   Adelaide A. Procter, 1862


   The shadows of the evening hours

   Fall from the darkening sky;

   Upon the fragrance of the flowers

   The dews of evening lie.

   Before thy throne, O Lord of heaven,

   We kneel at close of day;

   Look on thy children from on high,

   And hear us while we pray.


   The sorrows of thy servants, Lord,

   O do not thou despise,

   But let the incense of our prayers

   Before thy mercy rise.

   The brightness of the coming night

   Upon the darkness rolls;

   With hopes of future glory chase

   The shadows on our souls.


   Slowly the rays of daylight fade:

   So fade within our heart

   The hopes in earthly love and joy,

   That one by one depart.

   Slowly the bright stars, one by one,

   Within the heavens shine:

   Give us, O Lord, fresh hopes in heaven,

   And trust in things divine.


   Let peace, O Lord, thy peace, O God,

   Upon our souls descend;

   From midnight fears and perils, thou

   Our trembling hearts defend.

   Give us a respite from our toil;

   Calm and subdue our woes;

   Through the long day we labour, Lord,

   O give us now repose.

   Teach me to live, that I may dread

   The grave as little as my bed;

   Teach me to die, that so I may

   Rise glorious at the awful day.

   Tarry with me, O my Savior!

   For the day is passing by;

   See! the shades of evening gather,

   And the night is drawing nigh.


   Deeper, deeper grow the shadows,

   Paler now the glowing west,

   Swift the night of death advances;

   Shall it be the night of rest?


   Lonely seems the vale of shadow;

   Sinks my heart with troubled fear;

   Give me faith for clearer vision,

   Speak thou, Lord, in words of cheer.


   Let me hear thy voice behind me,

   Calming all these wild alarms;

   Let me, underneath my weakness,

   Feel the everlasting arms.


   Feeble, trembling, fainting, dying,

   Lord, I cast myself on thee;

   Tarry with me through the darkness;

   While I sleep, still watch by me.


   Tarry with me, O my Savior!

   Lay my head upon thy breast

   Till the morning; then awake me!

   Morning of eternal rest.


   Amen.

   [128]Retreat:

   Thomas Hastings, 1842

   Hugh Stowell, 1828


   From every stormy wind that blows,

   From every swelling tide of woes,

   There is a calm, a sure retreat;

   'Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.


   There is a place where Jesus sheds

   The oil of gladness on our heads,

   A place than all beside more sweet;

   It is the bloodstained mercy-seat.


   There is a spot where spirits blend,

   Where friend holds fellowship with friend;

   Though sundered far, by faith they meet

   Around one common mercy-seat.


   There, there, on eagles' wings we soar,

   And time and sense seem all no more;

   And heaven comes down, our souls to greet,

   And glory crowns the mercy-seat.

   And walls of salvation surround

   The soul he delights to defend.

   Alike at work and prayer

   To Jesus I repair;

   May Jesus Christ be praised.


   Whene'er the sweet church bell

   Peals over hill and dell,

   May Jesus Christ be praised;

   O hark to what it sings,

   As joyously it rings,

   May Jesus Christ be praised.

   Of chanting with the choir,

   May Jesus Christ be praised;

   This song of sacred joy,

   My comfort still is this,

   The night becomes as day,

   When from the heart we say,

   May Jesus Christ be praised;

   The powers of darkness fear,

   When this sweet chant they hear,

   May Jesus Christ be praised.


   In heaven's eternal bliss

   The loveliest strain is this,

   May Jesus Christ be praised;

   Let earth, and sea, and sky

   From depth to height reply

   May Jesus Christ be praised.


   Be this, while life is mine,

   My canticle divine,

   May Jesus Christ be praised;

   Be this the eternal song

   Through ages all along,

   May Jesus Christ be praised.

   When noon her throne in light arrays,

   To thee my soul triumphant springs;

   Thee, throned in glory's endless blaze,

   Thee, Lord of lords and King of kings.

   Thou priceless pearl for all who seek,

   To thee our earliest strength we vow;

   Thy love will bless the pure and meek;

   When dreams or mists beguile our sight,

   Turn thou our darkness into light.

   To slake the thirst of those that faint,

   Thy joy supreme, what words can paint?

   In earth's last hour of fleeting breath

   Be thou our conqueror over death.


   O Light, O Way, O Truth, O Life,

   O Jesus, born mankind to save,

   Give thou thy peace in deadliest strife;

   Shed thou thy calm on stormiest wave;

   Be thou our hope, our joy, our dread,

   Call us, O Lord, to thine eternal peace.

   Arr. by John B. Dykes, 1853

   W. Walsham How, 1871


   O Jesus, crucified for man,

   O Lamb, all glorious on thy throne,

   Teach thou our wondering souls to scan

   The mystery of thy love unknown.


   We pray thee, grant us strength to take

   Our daily cross, whate'er it be,

   And gladly for thine own dear sake

   In paths of pain to follow thee.


   As on our daily way we go,

   Through light or shade, in calm or strife,

   O may we bear thy marks below

   In conquered sin and chastened life.


   And week by week this day we ask

   That holy memories of thy cross

   May sanctify each common task,

   And turn to gain each earthly loss.


   Grant us, dear Lord, our cross to bear

   Till at thy feet we lay it down,

   Win through thy blood our pardon there,

   And through the cross attain the crown.

   Hosanna, Lord! Hosanna in the highest!

   Assembled in thy sacred Name,

   Where we thy parting promise claim:

   Hosanna, Lord! Hosanna in the highest!


   But, chiefest, in our cleansed breast,

   Eternal! bid thy Spirit rest;

   And make our secret soul to be

   A temple pure and worthy thee.

   To clear the mental ray,

   And on the eyes oppressed with night

   To pour celestial day.


   He comes, the broken heart to bind,

   The bleeding soul to cure:

   To enrich the humble poor.

   When justice shall be throned in might,

   And every hurt be healed;

   O Light of our dark sky,

   We praise thee for the radiance

   That from the hallowed page,

   A lantern to our footsteps,

   Shines on from age to age.


   The Church from her dear Master

   Received the gift divine,

   O'er all the earth to shine.

   It is the golden casket

   Where gems of truth are stored,

   It is the heaven-drawn picture

   Of Christ, the living Word.


   It floateth like a banner

   Before God's host unfurled;

   It shineth like a beacon

   Above the darkling world;

   It is the chart and compass

   That o'er life's surging sea,

   'Mid mists and rocks and quicksands,

   Still guides, O Christ, to thee.


   O make thy Church, dear Savior,

   A lamp of purest gold,

   To bear before the nations

   Thy true light as of old;

   O teach thy wandering pilgrims

   By this their path to trace

   Till, clouds and darkness ended,

   They see thee face to face.

   Without thee how could earth be trod,

   Great God, what do I see and hear!

   The Judge of all men doth appear

   On clouds of glory seated!

   The trumpet sounds; the graves restore

   The dead which they contained before;

   Prepare, my soul, to meet him!


   The dead in Christ shall first arise

   At the last trumpet's sounding,

   Caught up to meet him in the skies,

   With joy their Lord surrounding:

   No gloomy fears their souls dismay,

   His presence sheds eternal day

   On those prepared to meet him.


   But sinners, filled with guilty fears,

   Behold his wrath prevailing;

   For they shall rise and find their tears

   And sighs are unavailing;

   Trembling they stand before the throne,

   All unprepared to meet him.


   Great God, to thee my spirit clings,

   Day of wrath! O day of mourning!

   See fulfilled the prophets' warning,

   Heaven and earth in ashes burning!


   O what fear man's bosom rendeth,

   When from heaven the Judge descendeth,

   On whose sentence all dependeth.


   Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth;

   Through earth's sepulchers it ringeth;

   All before the throne it bringeth.


   Death is struck, and nature quaking,

   All creation is awaking,

   To its Judge an answer making.


   Lo! the book, exactly worded,

   Wherein all hath been recorded:

   Thence shall judgment be awarded.


   When the Judge his seat attaineth,

   And each hidden deed arraigneth,

   Nothing unavenged remaineth.


   What shall I, frail man, be pleading?

   Who for me be interceding,

   When the just are mercy needing?


   King of Majesty tremendous,

   Who dost free salvation send us,

   Fount of pity, then befriend us!


   Think, good Jesus, my salvation

   Cost thy wondrous Incarnation;

   Leave me not to reprobation!


   Faint and weary, thou hast sought me,

   On the cross of suffering bought me.

   Shall such grace be vainly brought me?


   Righteous Judge! for sin's pollution

   Grant thy gift of absolution,

   Ere the day of retribution.


   Guilty, now I pour my moaning,

   All my shame with anguish owning;

   Spare, O God, thy suppliant groaning!


   Thou the sinful woman savedst;

   Thou the dying thief forgavest;

   And to me a hope vouchsafest.


   Worthless are my prayers and sighing,

   Yet, good Lord, in grace complying,

   Rescue me from fires undying!


   With thy favoured sheep O place me;

   Nor among the goats abase me;

   But to thy right hand upraise me.


   While the wicked are confounded,

   Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,

   Call me with thy saints surrounded.


   Low I kneel, with heart submission,

   See, like ashes, my contrition;

   Help me in my last condition.


   Ah! that day of tears and mourning!

   From the dust of earth returning

   Man for judgment must prepare him;

   Spare, O God, in mercy spare him!


   Lord, all pitying, Jesus blest,

   Grant them thine eternal rest.

69. Brief life is here our portion

   7.6.7.6 D

   [244]St. Alphege:

   Henry J. Gauntlett, 1852

   Latin; St. Bernard of Cluny, 1145;

   Tr. John Mason Neale, 1858


   Brief life is here our portion,

   Brief sorrow, short-lived care;

   The life that knows no ending,

   The tearless life is there!

   O happy retribution!

   Short toil, eternal rest,

   For mortals and for sinners

   A mansion with the blest!


   There grief is turned to pleasure;

   Such pleasure as below

   No human voice can utter,

   No human heart can know;

   And after fleshly weakness,

   And after this world's night,

   And after storm and whirlwind,

   Are calm, and joy, and light.


   And now we fight the battle,

   But then shall wear the crown

   Of full and everlasting

   And passionless renown;

   And he whom now we trust in

   Shall then be seen and known,

   And they that know and see him

   Shall have him for their own.


   And now we watch and struggle,

   And now we live in hope,

   And Sion in her anguish

   With Babylon must cope;

   But there is David's fountain,

   And life in fullest glow;

   And there the light is golden,

   And milk and honey flow.


   The morning shall awaken,

   The shadows flee away,

   And each true-hearted servant

   Shall shine as doth the day;

   For God our King and Portion,

   In fullness of his grace,

   We then shall see for ever,

   And worship face to face.


   O sweet and blessed country,

   The home of God's elect!

   O sweet and blessed country

   That eager hearts expect!

   Jesus, in mercy bring us

   To that dear land of rest

   Who art with God the Father,

   And Spirit, ever blest.


   Amen.

   C.M.

   [246]St. Stephen:

   William Jones, 1789

   Greek;

   Tr. John Brownlie, 1907


   The King shall come when morning dawns,

   And light triumphant breaks;

   When beauty gilds the eastern hills,

   And life to joy awakes.


   Not as of old a little child

   To bear, and fight, and die,

   But crowned with glory like the sun

   That lights the morning sky.


   O brighter than the rising morn

   When he, victorious, rose,

   And left the lonesome place of death,

   Despite the rage of foes;


   O brighter than that glorious morn

   Shall this fair morning be,

   When Christ, our King, in beauty comes,

   And we his face shall see.


   The King shall come when morning dawns,

   And earth's dark night is past;

   O haste the rising of that morn,

   The day that aye shall last;


   And let the endless bliss begin,

   By weary saints foretold,

   When right shall triumph over wrong,

   And truth shall be extolled.


   The King shall come when morning dawns,

   And light and beauty brings:

   Hail, Christ the Lord! Thy people pray,

   Come quickly, King of kings.


   Amen.

   While shepherds watched their flocks by night,

   All seated on the ground,

   The angel of the Lord came down,

   And glory shone around.


   "Fear not," said he, for mighty dread

   Had seized their troubled mind;

   "Glad tidings of great joy I bring

   To you and all mankind.


   "To you, in David's town, this day

   Is born of David's line,

   The Savior, who is Christ the Lord;

   "The heavenly Babe you there shall find

   To human view displayed,

   All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,

   And in a manger laid."


   Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith

   Appeared a shining throng

   Of angels praising God, who thus

   Addressed their joyful song:


   "All glory be to God on high

   And on the earth be peace;

   Good will henceforth from heaven to men

76. Christians, awake, salute the happy morn

   Six 10's

   [283]Yorkshire:

   John Wainwright, 1755

   John Byrom, 1750


   Christians, awake, salute the happy morn,

   Whereon the Savior of the world was born;

   Rise to adore the mystery of love,

   Which hosts of angels chanted from above;

   With them the joyful tidings first begun

   Of God incarnate and the Virgin's Son.


   Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,

   Who heard the angelic herald's voice: "Behold,

   I bring good tidings of a Savior's birth

   To you and all the nations upon earth.

   This day hath God fulfilled his promised word,

   This day is born a Savior, Christ the Lord."


   He spake, and straightway the celestial choir

   In hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire;

   The praises of redeeming love they sang,

   And heaven's whole orb with alleluias rang;

   God's highest glory was their anthem still,

   Peace upon earth, and unto men good will.


   To Bethlehem straight the happy shepherds ran,

   To see the wonder God had wrought for man;

   And found, with Joseph and the blessed Maid,

   Her Son, the Savior, in a manger laid;

   Amazed, the wondrous story they proclaim,

   The earliest heralds of the Savior's name.


   Let us, like these good shepherds, then employ

   Our grateful voices to proclaim the joy;

   Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss,

   From his poor manger to his bitter cross;

   Treading his steps, assisted by his grace,

   Till man's first heavenly state again takes place.


   Then may we hope, the angelic thrones among,

   To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song;

   He, that was born upon this joyful day,

   Around us all his glory shall display;

   Saved by his love, incessant we shall sing

   Of angels and of angel-men the King.

   Sheds the fullness of his grace.


   God comes down that man may rise,

   Lifted by him to the skies;

   Christ is Son of man that we

   Sons of God in him may be.

   With thy Spirit day by day,

   O little town of Bethlehem!

   How still we see thee lie;

   Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

   The silent stars go by;

   Yet in thy dark streets shineth

   The everlasting Light;

   The hopes and fears of all the years

   Are met in thee tonight.


   For Christ is born of Mary,

   And gathered all above,

   While mortals sleep, the angels keep

   Their watch of wondering love.

   O morning stars, together

   Proclaim the holy birth!

   And praises sing to God the King,

   And peace to men on earth.


   How silently, how silently,

   The wondrous gift is given!

   So God imparts to human hearts

   The blessings of his heaven.

   No ear may hear his coming,

   But in this world of sin,

   Where meek souls will receive him, still

   The dear Christ enters in.


   O holy Child of Bethlehem!

   Descend to us, we pray;

   Cast out our sin and enter in,

   Be born in us today.

   We hear the Christmas angels

   The great glad tidings tell;

   O come to us, abide with us,

   Our Lord Emmanuel!

   To touch their harps of gold:

   Peace on the earth, good-will to men,

   From heaven's all-gracious King;

   The world in solemn stillness lay

   To hear the angels sing.


   Still through the cloven skies they come,

   With peaceful wings unfurled;

   And still their heavenly music floats

   O'er all the weary world:

   Above its sad and lowly plains

   They bend on hovering wing,

   And ever o'er its Babel sounds

   The blessed angels sing.


   O ye, beneath life's crushing load,

   Whose forms are bending low,

   Who toil along the climbing way

   With painful steps and slow!

   Look now, for glad and golden hours

   Come swiftly on the wing:

   O rest beside the weary road,

   And hear the angels sing.


   For lo! the days are hastening on,

   By prophets seen of old,

   When with the evercircling years,

   Shall come the time foretold,

   When the new heaven and earth shall own

   The Prince of Peace their King,

   And the whole world send back the song

   Which now the angels sing.

   Thou didst leave thy throne and thy kingly crown,

   When thou camest to earth for me;

   But in Bethlehem's home was there found no room

   For thy holy nativity.

   O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!

   There is room in my heart for thee.


   Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,

   Proclaiming thy royal degree;

   But in lowly birth didst thou come to earth,

   And in great humility.

   O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!

   There is room in my heart for thee.


   The foxes found rest, and the birds had their nest

   In the shade of the forest tree;

   But thy couch was the sod, O thou Son of God,

   In the desert of Galilee.

   O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!

   There is room in my heart for thee.


   Thou camest, O Lord, with the living word,

   That should set thy people free;

   But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,

   They bore thee to Calvary.

   O come to my heart, Lord Jesus!

   Thy cross is my only plea.


   When the heavens shall ring, and the angels sing

   At thy coming to victory,

   Let thy voice call me home, saving, "Yet there is room

   There is room at my side for thee."

   And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,

   When thou comest and callest for me.

   The Son of God goes forth to war,

   Who best can drink his cup of woe,

   Triumphant over pain;

   Who patient bears his cross below,

   He follows in his train.


   The martyr first, whose eagle eye

   Could pierce beyond the grave;

   Who saw his Master in the sky,

   And called on him to save.


   Like him, with pardon on his tongue,

   In midst of mortal pain,

   He prayed for them that did the wrong:

   Who follows in his train?


   A glorious band, the chosen few,

   On whom the Spirit came:

   Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,

   And mocked the cross and flame.


   They met the tyrant's brandished steel,

   The lion's gory mane;

   They bowed their necks the death to feel:

   Who follows in their train?


   A noble army, men and boys,

   The matron and the maid,

   Around the Savior's throne rejoice,

   In robes of light arrayed.


   They climbed the steep ascent of heaven

   Through peril, toil, and pain:

   O God, to us may grace be given

   To follow in their train.

   And in thy word and in thy will

   To hear thy voice and know thy love;


   And when the toils of life are done,

   And nature waits thy just decree,

   To find our rest beneath thy throne,

   And look in certain hope to thee.


   To thee, O Jesus, Light of Light,

   Whom as their King the saints adore,

   Thou strength and refuge in the fight,

   Be laud and glory evermore.

   L.M.

   [314]Alstone:

   Christopher Edwin Willing, 1868

   Cecil Frances Alexander, 1850


   O Lord, the Holy Innocents

   Laid down for thee their infant life,

   And martyrs brave and patient saints

   Have stood for thee in fire and strife.


   We wear the cross they wore of old

   Our lips have learned like vows to make;

   We need not die; we cannot fight;

   What may we do for Jesus' sake?


   O day by day each Christian child

   Has much to do, without, within;

   A death to die for Jesus' sake,

   A weary war to wage with sin.


   When deep within our swelling hearts

   The thoughts of pride and anger rise,

   When bitter words are on our tongues,

   And tears of passion in our eyes;


   Then we may stay the angry blow,

   Then we may check the hasty word,

   Give gentle answers back again,

   And fight a battle for our Lord.


   With smiles of peace and looks of love,

   Light in our dwellings we may make,

   Bid kind good-humour brighten there,

   And do all still for Jesus' sake.


   There's not a child so weak and small

   But has his little cross to take,

   His little work of love and praise,

   That he may do for Jesus' sake.

   6.5, twelve lines

   [343]Valour:

   Arthur H. Mann, 1889

   Refrain

   Godfrey Thring (1873-)


   From the eastern mountains,

   Pressing on they come,

   Wise men in their wisdom

   To his humble home;

   Stirred by deep devotion,

   Hasting from afar,

   Ever journeying onward,

   Guided by a star.


   Light of Light that shineth

   Ere the worlds began,

   Draw thou near, and lighten

   Every heart of man.


   There their Lord and Savior

   Meek and lowly lay,

   Wondrous Light that led them

   Onward on their way,

   Ever now to lighten

   Nations from afar,

   As they journey homeward

   By that guiding star.


   Thou who in a manger

   Once hast lowly lain,

   Who dost now in glory

   O'er all kingdoms reign,

   Gather in the heathen,

   Who in lands afar

   Ne'er have seen the brightness

   Of thy guiding star.


   Gather in the outcasts,

   All who've gone astray,

   Throw thy radiance o'er them,

   Guide them on their way,

   Those who never knew thee,

   Those who've wandered far,

   Lead them by the brightness

   Of thy guiding star.


   Onward through the darkness

   Of the lonely night,

   Shining still before them

   With thy kindly light,

   Guide them, Jew and Gentile,

   Homeward from afar,

   Young and old together,

   By thy guiding star.


   Until every nation,

   Whether bond or free,

   'Neath thy starlit banner,

   Jesus, follows thee

   O'er the distant mountains

   To that heavenly home,

   Where no sin nor sorrow

   Evermore shall come.

   Came to rule his Israel.


   Fairer than the sun at morning

   Was the star that told his birth,

   To the world its God announcing

   Seen in fleshly form on earth.


   Eastern sages at his cradle

   Make oblations rich and rare;

   See them give, in deep devotion,

   Gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.


   Sacred gifts of mystic meaning:

   Incense doth their God disclose,

   Gold the King of kings proclaimeth,

   Myrrh his sepulcher foreshows.

   As with gladness men of old

   Did the guiding star behold,

   As with joy they hailed its light,

   Leading onward, beaming bright;

   So, most gracious Lord, may we

   Evermore be led to thee.


   As with joyful steps they sped

   To that lowly manger-bed;

   There to bend the knee before

   Him whom heaven and earth adore;

   So may we with willing feet

   Ever seek the mercy-seat.


   As they offered gifts most rare

   At that manger rude and bare;

   So may we with holy joy,

   Pure and free from sin's alloy,

   All our costliest treasures bring,

   Christ! to thee, our heavenly King.


   Holy Jesus! every day

   Keep us in the narrow way;

   And, when earthly things are past,

   Bring our ransomed souls at last

   Where they need no star to guide,

   Where no clouds thy glory hide.


   In the heavenly country bright,

   Need they no created light;

   Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,

   Thou its Sun which goes not down,

   There for ever may we sing

   Alleluias to our King.

   Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,

   Dawn on our darkness, and lend us thine aid;

   Star of the east, the horizon adorning,

   Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.


   Cold on his cradle the dewdrops are shining,

   Low lies his head with the beasts of the stall;

   Angels adore him in slumber reclining,

   Maker and Monarch and Savior of all.


   Shall we not yield him, in costly devotion,

   Odours of Edom, and offerings divine,

   Gems of the mountain, and pearls of the ocean,

   Myrrh from the forest, and gold from the mine?


   Vainly we offer each ample oblation,

   Vainly with gifts would his favour secure;

   Richer by far is the heart's adoration,

   Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.


   Brightest and best of the rolls of the morning,

   Dawn on our darkness, and lend us thine aid;

   Star of the east, the horizon adorning,

   Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.

   Manifest at Jordan's stream,

   Manifest in valiant fight,

   Quelling all the devil's might;

   Manifest in gracious will,

   Ever bringing good from ill;

   Anthems be to thee addressed,

   God in Man made manifest.


   Sun and moon shall darkened be,

   Stars shall fall, the heavens shall flee,

   Christ will then like lightning shine,

   All will see his glorious sign:

   All will then the trumpet hear;

   All will see the Judge appear;

   Thou by all wilt be confessed,

   God in Man made manifest.


   Grant us grace to see thee, Lord,

   Mirrored in thy holy word;

   May we imitate thee now,

   And be pure, as pure art thou;

   [402]St. Cecilia:

   Leighton G. Hayne, 1863

   Lewis Hensley, 1867


   Thy kingdom come, O God!

   Thy rule, O Christ, begin!

   Break with thine iron rod

   The tyrannies of sin!


   Where is thy reign of peace,

   And purity, and love?

   When shall all hatred cease,

   As in the realms above?


   When comes the promised time

   That war shall be no more,

   Oppression, lust, and crime

   Shall flee thy face before?


   We pray thee, Lord, arise,

   And come in thy great might;

   Revive our longing eyes,

   Which languish for thy sight.


   O'er heathen lands afar

   Thick darkness broodeth yet:

   Arise, O Morning Star,

   Arise, and never set.

   Watchman, tell us of the night,

   What its signs of promise are.

   Traveler, o'er yon mountain's height,

   See that glory-beaming star.

   Watchman, does its beauteous ray

   Aught of joy or hope foretell?

   Traveler, yes; it brings the day,

   Promised day of Israel.


   Watchman, tell us of the night;

   Higher yet that star ascends.

   Traveler, blessedness and light,

   Peace and truth its course portends.

   Watchman, will its beams alone

   Gild the spot that gave them birth?

   Traveler, ages are its own;

   See, it bursts o'er all the earth.


   Watchman, tell us of the night,

   For the morning seems to dawn.

   Traveler, darkness takes its flight,

   Doubt and terror are withdrawn.

   Watchman, let thy wanderings cease;

   Hie thee to thy quiet home.

   Traveler, lo! the Prince of Peace,

   Lo! the Son of God is come!

   O North, with all thy vales of green,

   Uplift the voice of psalms;

   Raise, ancient East, the anthem high,

   And let the youthful West reply.


   Lo, in the clouds of heaven appears

   God's well-beloved Son;

   He brings a train of brighter years;

   His kingdom is begun.

   He comes, a guilty world to bless

   With mercy, truth, and righteousness.


   O Father, haste the promised hour,

   When at his feet shall lie

   All rule, authority, and power,

   Beneath the ample sky;

   When he shall reign from pole to pole,

   The Lord of every human soul:


   When all shall heed the words he said

   Amid their daily cares,

   And by the loving life he led

   Shall seek to pattern theirs;

   And he who conquered death shall win

   The mightier conquest over sin.

   How beauteous were the marks divine

   That in thy meekness used to shine;

   That lit thy lonely pathway, trod

   In wondrous love, O Son of God!


   O who like thee, so calm, so bright,

   Thou Son of man, thou Light of Light;

   O who like thee did ever go

   So patient through a world of woe?


   O who like thee so humbly bore

   The scorn, the scoffs of men before?

   So meek, forgiving, Godlike, high,

   So glorious in humility!


   And all thy life's unchanging years,

   A man of sorrows and of tears,

   The cross, where all our sins were laid,

   Upon thy bending shoulders weighed.


   And death, that sets the prisoner free,

   Was pang and scoff and scorn to thee;

   Yet love through all thy torture glowed,

   And mercy with thy life-blood flowed.


   O in thy light be mine to go,

   Illuming all this way of woe;

   And give me ever on the road

   To trace thy footsteps, Son of God!


   Amen.

   Adapted from Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)

   James R. Woodford, 1868


   Not by thy mighty hand,

   Thy wondrous works alone,

   But by the marvels of thy word,

   Thy glory, Lord, is known.


   Forth from the eternal gates,

   Thine everlasting home,

   To sow the seed of truth below,

   Thou didst vouchsafe to come.


   And still from age to age,

   Thou, gracious Lord, hast been

   The Bearer forth of goodly seed

   The Sower still unseen.


   And thou wilt come again,

   And heaven beneath thee bow,

   To reap the harvest thou hast sown,

   Sower and Reaper thou.


   Watch, Lord, thy harvest field

   With thine unsleeping eye,

   The children of the Kingdom keep

   To thy Epiphany;


   That when, in thy great day,

   The tares shall severed be,

   We may be surely gathered in

   With all thy saints to thee.

   Alleluia, song of gladness,

   Voice of joy that cannot die;

   Alleluia is the anthem

   Ever dear to choirs on high;

   In the house of God abiding

   Thus they sing eternally.


   Alleluia thou resoundest,

   True Jerusalem and free;

   Alleluia, joyful mother,

   All thy children sing with thee;

   But by Babylon's sad waters

   Mourning exiles now are we.


   Alleluia cannot always

   Be our song while here below;

   Alleluia our transgressions

   Make us for a while forego:

   For the solemn time is coming

   When our tears for sin must flow.


   Therefore in our hymns we pray thee,

   Grant us, blessed Trinity,

   At the last to keep thine Easter

   In our home beyond the sky;

   There to thee for ever singing

   Alleluia joyfully.

   Where are crimes of blackest dye,

   There the saving sign display!


   To the weary and the worn

   Tell of realms where sorrows cease!

   To the outcast and forlorn

   Speak of mercy and of peace!


   Guard the helpless! seek the strayed!

   Comfort troubles! banish grief!

   In the might of God arrayed,

   Scatter sin and unbelief!


   Be the banner still unfurled,

   Still unsheathed the Spirit's sword,

   Till the kingdoms of the world

   Are the kingdom of the Lord!

   And the best, is love.

   [485]St. Andrew of Crete:

   Greek; St. Andrew of Crete;

   Tr. John Mason Neale, 1862


   Christian! dost thou see them

   On the holy ground,

   How the powers of darkness

   Rage thy steps around?

   Christian! up and smite them,

   Counting gain but loss;

   In the strength that cometh

   By the holy cross.


   Christian! dost thou feel then

   How they work within,

   Striving, tempting, luring,

   Goading into sin?

   Christian! never tremble;

   Never be downcast;

   Gird thee for the battle,

   Watch and pray and fast.


   Christian! dost thou hear them,

   How they speak thee fair?

   "Always fast and vigil?

   Always watch and prayer?"

   Christian! answer boldly:

   "While I breathe I pray!"

   Peace shall follow battle,

   Night shall end in day.


   "Well I know thy trouble,

   O my servant true;

   Thou art very weary,

   I was weary too;

   But that toil shall make thee

   Some day all mine own,

   And the end of sorrow

   Shall be near my throne."

   Refrain

   James J. Cummins, 1839


   Jesus, Lord of life and glory,

   Bend from heaven thy gracious ear;

   While our waiting souls adore thee,

   Friend of helpless sinners, hear:


   From the depths of nature's blindness,

   From the hardening power of sin,

   From all malice and unkindness,

   From the pride that lurks within,


   When temptation sorely presses,

   In the day of Satan's power,

   In our times of deep distresses,

   In each dark and trying hour,


   When the world around is smiling,

   In the time of wealth and ease

   Earthly joys our hearts beguiling,

   In the day of health and peace,


   In the weary hours of sickness,

   In the times of grief and pain,

   When we feel our mortal weakness,

   When all human help is vain,


   In the solemn hour of dying,

   In the awful judgment day,

   May our souls, on thee relying,

   Find thee still our hope and stay:


   By thy mercy,

   O deliver us, good Lord.


   Amen.

   Charlotte Elliott, 1836


   "Christian, seek not yet repose,"

   Hear thy guardian angel say;

   "Thou art in the midst of foes:

   Watch and pray!"


   Principalities and powers,

   Mustering their unseen array,

   Wait for thy unguarded hours:

   Watch and pray!


   Gird thy heavenly armour on,

   Wear it ever, night and day;

   Ambushed lies the evil one:

   Watch and pray!


   Hear the victors who o'ercame;

   Still they mark each warrior's way;

   All with one sweet voice exclaim:

   "Watch and pray!"


   Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,

   Him thou lovest to obey;

   Hide within thy heart his word:

   "Watch and pray!"


   Watch, as if on that alone

   Hung the issue of the day;

   Pray that help may be sent down:

   Watch and pray!

   Four 10's

   [492]Langran:

   James Langran, 1862

   Samuel J. Stone, 1866


   Weary of self, and laden with my sin,

   I look at heaven and long to enter in,

   But there no evil thing may find a home:

   And yet I hear a voice that bids me "Come."


   The while I fain would tread the heavenly way

   Evil is ever with me day by day;

   Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall:

   "Repent, confess, thou shalt be loosed from all."


   It is the voice of Jesus that I hear;

   His are the hands stretched out to draw me near,

   And his the blood that can for all atone,

   And set me faultless there before the throne.


   'Twas he who found me on the deathly wild,

   And he made me heir of heaven, the Father's child,

   And day by day, whereby my soul may live,

   Gives me his grace of pardon, and will give.


   O great Absolver, grant my soul may wear

   The lowliest garb of penitence and prayer

   That in the Father's courts my glorious

   May be the garment of thy righteousness.


   Yea, thou wilt answer for me, righteous Lord;

   Thine all the merits, mine the great reward;

   Thine the sharp thorns, and mine the golden crown;

   Mine the life won, and thine the life laid down.


   Amen.

   Savior! when in dust to thee

   Low we bow the adoring knee;

   When, repentant, to the skies

   Scarce we lift our weeping eyes,

   O by all thy pains and woe

   Suffered once for man below,

   Bending from thy throne on high,

   Hear our solemn litany!


   By thy helpless infant years,

   By thy life of want and tears,

   By thy days of sore distress

   In the savage wilderness,

   By the dread mysterious hour

   Of the insulting tempter's power;

   Turn, O turn a favouring eye,

   Hear our solemn litany!


   By the sacred grief that wept

   O'er the grave where Lazarus slept;

   By the boding tears that flowed

   Over Salem's loved abode;

   By the anguished sigh that told

   Treachery lurked within thy fold;

   From thy seat above the sky,

   Hear our solemn litany!


   By thine hour of dire despair,

   By thine agony of prayer,

   By the cross, the nail, the thorn,

   Piercing spear, and torturing scorn;

   By the gloom that veiled the skies

   O'er the dreadful sacrifice;

   Listen to our humble cry,

   Hear our solemn litany!


   By thy deep expiring groan,

   By the sad sepulchral stone,

   By the vault, whose dark abode

   Held in vain the rising God:

   O from earth to heaven restored,

   Mighty, reascended Lord,

   Listen, listen to the cry

   Of our solemn litany!


   Amen.

   Anon.

   James Hamilton, 1867


   O Jesus! Lord most merciful,

   Low at thy cross I lie;

   O sinner's Friend, most pitiful,

   Hear my bewailing cry.

   I come to thee with mourning,

   I come to thee in woe;

   With contrite heart returning,

   And tears that overflow.


   O gracious Intercessor!

   O Priest within the veil!

   Plead, for a lost transgressor,

   The blood that cannot fail.

   I spread my sins before thee,

   I tell them one by one;

   O for thy Name's great glory,

   Forgive all I have done!


   O by thy cross and passion,

   Thy tears and agony,

   And crown of cruel fashion,

   And death on Calvary;

   By all that untold suffering

   Endured by thee alone;

   O Priest! O spotless Offering!

   Plead for me and atone!


   And in this heart now broken,

   Reenter thou and reign;

   And say, by that dear token,

   I am absolved again;

   And build me up, and guide me,

   And guard me day by day;

   And in thy presence hide me,

   And keep my soul alway.


   Amen.

   W. Walsham How, 1867


   O Jesus, thou art standing

   In lowly patience waiting

   To pass the threshold o'er:

   Shame on us, Christian brothers,

   His Name and sign who bear;

   O shame, thrice shame upon us,

   To keep him standing there!


   O Jesus, thou art knocking:

   And lo! that hand is scarred,

   And thorns thy brow encircle,

   And tears thy face have marred:

   O love that passeth knowledge

   So patiently to wait!

   O sin that hath no equal,

   So fast to bar the gate!


   O Jesus, thou art pleading

   In accents meek and low:

   "I died for you, my children,

   And will ye treat me so?"

   O Lord, with shame and sorrow

   We open now the door:

   Dear Savior, enter, enter,

   And leave us nevermore.

   With broken heart and contrite sigh,

   A trembling sinner, Lord, I cry:

   Thy pardoning grace is rich and free:

   O God, be merciful to me.


   I smite upon my troubled breast,

   With deep and conscious guilt oppressed;

   Christ and his cross my only plea:

   O God, be merciful to me.


   Far off I stand with tearful eyes,

   Nor dare uplift them to the skies;

   But thou dost all my anguish see:

   O God, be merciful to me.


   Nor alms, nor deeds that I have done,

   Can for a single sin atone;

   To Calvary alone I flee:

   O God, be merciful to me.


   And when, redeemed from sin and hell,

   With all the ransomed throng I dwell,

   My raptured song shall ever be,

   God has been merciful to me.

   And close by thee to stay.


   As thou with Satan didst contend,

   And didst the victory win,

   To die to self, and chiefly live

   By thy most holy word.

   And through thy Passion-tide,

   Yea, evermore, in life and death,

   Jesus, and shall it ever be,

   A mortal man ashamed of thee?

   Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,

   Whose glories shine through endless days?


   Ashamed of Jesus! sooner far

   Let night disown each radiant star;

   Tis midnight with my soul, till he,

   Bright Morning Star, bid darkness flee.


   Ashamed of Jesus! O as soon

   Let morning blush to own the sun!

   He sheds the beams of light divine

   O'er this benighted soul of mine.


   Ashamed of Jesus! that dear Friend

   On whom my hopes of heaven depend!

   No, when I blush, be this my shame,

   That I no more revere his Name.


   Ashamed of Jesus! empty pride!

   I'll boast a Savior crucified;

   And O may this my portion be,

   My Savior not ashamed of me.

   For thee, not without hope, I mourn:

   I have an Advocate above,

   A Friend before the throne of love.


   O Jesus, full of truth and grace,

   More full of grace than I of sin;

   Yet once again I seek thy face:

   Open thine arms and take me in;

   And freely my backslidings heal,

   And love the faithless sinner still.


   Thou know'st the way to bring me back,

   My fallen spirit to restore;

   O for thy truth and mercy's sake,

   Forgive, and bid me sin no more:

   The ruins of my soul repair,

   And make my heart a house of prayer.

   Thou, O Christ, canst health impart,

   Binding up the bleeding heart.

   C.M.

   [511]St. Bernard:

   Cologne, 1741

   Cecil Frances Alexander, 1858


   When wounded sore the stricken soul

   Lies bleeding and unbound,

   One only hand, a piercèd hand,

   Can heal the sinner's wound.


   When sorrow swells the laden breast,

   And tears of anguish flow,

   One only heart, a broken heart,

   Can feel the sinner's woe.


   When penitence has wept in vain,

   Over some foul dark spot,

   One only stream, a stream of blood,

   Can wash away the blot.


   'Tis Jesus' blood that washes white,

   His hand that brings relief,

   His heart that's touched with all our joys,

   And feeleth for our grief.


   Lift up thy bleeding hand, O Lord;

   Unseal that cleansing tide;

   We have no shelter from our sin,

   But in thy wounded side.

   With many a conflict, many a doubt,

   Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,

   All glory, laud, and honor

   To thee, Redeemer, King!

   To whom the lips of children

   Made sweet hosannas ring.


   Thou art the King of Israel,

   Thou David's royal Son,

   Who in the Lord's Name comest,

   The King and Blessed One.


   The company of angels

   Are praising thee on high;

   And mortal men, and all things

   Created, make reply.


   The people of the Hebrews

   With palms before thee went:

   Our praise and prayers and anthems

   Before thee we present.


   To thee before thy Passion

   They sang their hymns of praise:

   To thee, now high exalted,

   Our melody we raise.


   Thou didst accept their praises;

   Accept the prayers we bring,

   Who in all good delightest,

   Thou good and gracious King.

   The royal banners forward go,

   The cross shines forth in mystic glow;

   Where he in flesh, our flesh who made,

   Our sentence bore, our ransom paid.


   There whilst he hung, his sacred side

   By soldier's spear was opened wide,

   To cleanse us in the precious flood

   Of water mingled with his blood.


   Fulfilled is now what David told

   In true prophetic song of old,

   How God the heathen's King should be;

   For God is reigning from the tree.


   O tree of glory, tree most fair,

   Ordained those holy limbs to bear,

   How bright in purple robe it stood,

   The purple of a Savior's blood!


   Upon its arms, like balance true,

   He weighed the price for sinners due,

   The price which none but he could pay,

   And spoiled the spoiler of his prey.


   To thee, eternal Three in One,

   Let homage meet by all be done:

   As by the cross thou dost restore,

   So rule and guide us evermore.

   Within a weary land;

   A home within the wilderness,

   A rest upon the way,

   From the burning of the noontide heat,

   And the burden of the day.


   Upon the cross of Jesus

   Mine eyes at times can see

   The very dying form of One

   Who suffered there for me;

   And from my smitten heart with tears

   These wonders I confess:

   The wonders of redeeming love,

   And my own worthlessness.


   I take, O cross, thy shadow

   For my abiding place;

   I ask no other sunshine than

   The sunshine of his face;

   Content to let the world go by,

   To know no gain nor loss,

   My sinful self my only shame,

   My glory all the cross.

   Rough wood thy throne;

   For us thy blood is shed,

   Us alone.


   No pillow under thee

   To rest thy head;

   Only the splintered cross

   Is thy bed.


   [Nails pierced thy hands and feet,

   Thy side the spear;

   No voice is nigh to say

   Help is near.


   Shadows of midnight fall,

   Though it is day:

   Thy friends and kinsfolk stand

   Far away.


   Loud is thy bitter cry;

   Sunk on thy breast

   Hangeth thy bleeding head

   Without rest.


   Loud scoffs the dying thief,

   Who mocks at thee:

   Can it, my Savior, be

   All for me?


   Gazing, afar from thee,

   Silent and lone,

   Stand those few weepers thou

   Callest thine own.


   I see thy title, Lord,

   Inscribed above;

   "Jesus of Nazareth,"

   King of Love.]


   What, O my Savior,

   Here didst thou see,

   Which made thee suffer and

   Die for me?


   [Child of my grief and pain,

   Watched by my love;

   I came to call thee to

   Realms above.


   I saw thee wandering

   Far off from me:

   In love I seek for thee;

   Do not flee.


   For thee my blood I shed,

   For thee alone;

   I came to purchase thee,

   For mine own.


   Weep thou not for my grief,

   Child of my love:

   Strive to be with me in

   Heaven above.]


   O I will follow thee,

   Star of my soul,

   Through the deep shades of life

   To the goal.


   Yea, let thy cross be borne

   Each day by me;

   Mind not how heavy, if

   But with thee.


   Lord, if thou only wilt,

   Make us thine own,

   Give no companion, save

   Thee alone.


   Grant through each day of life

   To stand by thee;

   With thee, when morning breaks

   Ever to be.


   Amen.

   cento.


   Resting from his work today,

   In the tomb the Savior lay,

   Still he slept, from head to feet

   Shrouded in the winding sheet,

   Lying in the rock alone,

   Hidden by the sealèd stone.


   Late at even there was seen

   Watching long the Magdalene;

   Early, ere the break of day,

   Sorrowful she took her way

   To the holy garden glade,

   Where her buried Lord was laid.


   So with thee, till life shall end,

   I would solemn vigil spend:

   Let me hew thee, Lord, a shrine

   In this rocky heart of mine,

   Where in pure embalmed cell

   None but thou may ever dwell.


   Myrrh and spices will I bring,

   True affection's offering;

   Close the door from sight and sound

   Of the busy world around;

   And in patient watch remain

   Till my Lord appear again.

   Fulfill thy promise, King of love, we pray!

   The third morn brightens; rise, and come away.


   No mouldering tomb shall hold thee in repose;

   No stone the ransom of the world enclose.


   Who holdest all things in thy hollowed hand,

   No rocky barrier can before thee stand.


   Cast off thy grave-clothes; let them there remain:

   Come forth to us, our All, our only gain.


   Creator, Fount of Life, thou knowest the grave;

   And thence returning, thou art strong to save.


   Light of the world, show us thy face once more,

   The day that died with thee, today restore.


   A countless people, from death's fetters free,

   Own thee Redeemer, join and follow thee.


   The shades of death are pierced, his laws undone,

   And trembling chaos flees the rising sun.

   Mighty victim from the sky,

   Hell's fierce powers beneath thee lie;

   Thou hast conquered in the fight,

   Thou hast brought us life and light:

   Now no more can death appall,

   Now no more the grave enthrall;

   Thou hast opened Paradise,

   And in thee thy saints shall rise.


   Easter triumph, Easter joy,

   Sin alone can this destroy;

   From sin's power do thou set free

   Souls new-born, O Lord, in thee.

   Hymns of glory and of praise,

   Risen Lord, to thee we raise;

   Holy Father, praise to thee,

   With the Spirit, ever be.


   Amen.

   He is risen, he is risen,

   Tell it out with joyful voice:

   He has burst his three days' prison;

   Let the whole wide earth rejoice:

   Death is conquered, man is free,

   Christ has won the victory.


   Come, ye sad and fearful-hearted,

   With glad smile and radiant brow:

   Lent's long shadows have departed;

   All his woes are over now,

   And the passion that he bore:

   Sin and pain can vex no more.


   Come, with high and holy hymning,

   Chant our Lord's triumphant lay;

   Not one darksome cloud is dimming

   Yonder glorious morning ray,

   Breaking o'er the purple east,

   Symbol of our Easter feast.


   He is risen, he is risen;

   He hath opened heaven's gate:

   We are free from sin's dark prison,

   Risen to a holier state;

   And a brighter Easter beam

   On our longing eyes shall stream.

   Forty days of Eastertide

   Thou didst visit oft thine own;

   Now by glimpses, Lord, descried,

   Handled now, and proved, and known:


   Known, most Merciful, yet veiled;

   Else before the awful sight

   Surely heart and flesh had failed,

   Smitten with exceeding light.


   Risen Master, fain would we,

   Sharing those unearthly days,

   Morn and eve, on shore and sea,

   Watch thy movements, mark thy ways;


   Catch by faith each glad surprise

   Of thy footsteps drawing nigh;

   Hear thy sudden greeting rise,

   "Peace be to you! It is I!"


   Secrets of thy kingdom learn,

   Read the vision open spread,

   Feel thy word within us burn,

   Know thee in the broken Bread.


   So thy glory's skirts beside,

   Gently led from grace to grace,

   We thy coming may abide,

   And adore thee face to face.


   Amen.

   Now glows the earth with painted flowers' array,

   Now Christ, from gloomy hell, comes triumphing,

   And field and grove with clover and leafage spring.


   The reign of death o'erthrown, he mounts on high,

   Sent forth with joyous praise from sea and sky.


   Loose now the captives, loose the prison door,

   The fallen, from the deep, to light restore.


   A countless people, from death's fetters free,

   Own thee Redeemer, join, and follow thee.


   Creator and Redeemer, Christ our Light!

   The One begotten of the Father's might;

   The Lord that all his foes o'ercame,

   The world, sin, death, and hell o'erthrew;

   And Jesus is the Conqueror's name.

   With all its grace is given;

   Their name, an everlasting name,

   Their joy, the joy of heaven.


   They suffer with their Lord below,

   They reign with Him above,

   Their profit and their joy to know

   The mystery of His love.


   The cross He bore is life and health,

   Though shame and death to Him:

   His people's hope, His people's wealth,

   Their everlasting theme.

   With sin and care oppressed;

   Lord, send thy promised Comforter,

   Thou art gone up on high;

   But Thou didst first come down,

   Through earth's most bitter agony,

   To pass unto Thy crown;

   And girt with griefs and fears

   Our onward course must be;

   But only let that path of tears

   Lead us at last to thee.


   Thou art gone up on high;

   But Thou shalt come again,

   With all the bright ones of the sky

   Attendant in Thy train.

   Among the sons of men;

   For me He bore the shameful cross,

   And carried all my grief.


   To Him I owe my life and breath,

   And all the joys I have;

   He makes me triumph over death,

   And saves me from the grave.

   Come, Thou Holy Spirit, come!

   And from Thy celestial home

   Shed a ray of light divine!

   Come, Thou Father of the poor!

   Come, Thou Source of all our store!

   Come, within our bosoms shine!


   Thou, of comforters the best;

   Thou, the soul's most welcome Guest;

   Sweet refreshment here below;

   In our labor, rest most sweet;

   Grateful coolness in the heat;

   Solace in the midst of woe.


   O most blessèd Light divine,

   Shine within these hearts of Thine,

   And our inmost being fill!

   Where thou art not, man hath naught,

   Nothing good in deed or thought,

   Nothing free from taint of ill.


   Heal our wounds, our strength renew;

   On our dryness pour Thy dew;

   Wash the stains of guilt away:

   Bend the stubborn heart and will;

   Melt the frozen, warm the chill;

   Guide the steps that go astray.


   On the faithful, who adore

   And confess Thee, evermore

   In Thy sevenfold gifts descend;

   Give them virtue's sure reward;

   Give them Thy salvation, Lord;

   Give them joys that never end.


   Amen.

   Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed

   His tender, last farewell,

   A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed

   With us to dwell.


   He came sweet influence to impart,

   A gracious, willing Guest,

   While He can find one humble heart

   Wherein to rest.


   And His that gentle voice we hear,

   Soft as the breath of even,

   That checks each fault, that calms each fear,

   And speaks of heaven.


   And every virtue we possess,

   And every victory won,

   And every thought of holiness

   Are His alone.


   Spirit of purity and grace,

   Our weakness, pitying, see;

   O make our hearts thy dwelling-place,

   See how we grovel here below,

   Fond of these earthly toys:

   Our souls, how heavily they go,

   To reach eternal joys.


   In vain we tune our lifeless songs,

   In vain we strive to rise:

   Hosannas languish on our tongues,

   And our devotion dies.

   Come, shed abroad a Savior's love,

   And that shall kindle ours.

   And make us know and choose thy way;

   Plant holy fear in every heart,

   That we from thee may ne'er depart.


   Lead us to Christ, the living Way,

   Nor let us from his precepts stray;

   Lead us to holiness, the road

   That we must take to dwell with God.


   Lead us to heaven, that we may share

   Fullness of joy for ever there;

   Lead us to God, our final rest,

   To be with him for ever blest.

   Teach our faltering tongues to speak;

   Hear us, Holy Spirit.


   Come to aid the souls who yearn

   More of truth divine to learn,

   And with deeper love to burn;

   German; Martin Luther, 1529;

   Tr. Frederick H. Hedge, 1852


   A mighty Fortress is our God,

   A Bulwark never failing;

   Our Helper he amid the flood

   Of mortal ills prevailing:

   For still our ancient foe

   Doth seek to work us woe;

   His craft and power are great,

   And, armed with cruel hate,

   On earth is not his equal.


   Did we in our own strength confide,

   Our striving would be losing;

   Were not the right man on our side,

   The man of God's own choosing:

   Dost ask who that may be?

   Christ Jesus, it is he;

   Lord Sabaoth his Name,

   From age to age the same,

   And he must win the battle.


   And though this world, with devils filled,

   Should threaten to undo us;

   We will not fear, for God hath willed

   His truth to triumph through us:

   The prince of darkness grim,

   We tremble not for him;

   His rage we can endure,

   For lo! his doom is sure,

   One little word shall fell him.


   That word above all earthly powers,

   No thanks to them, abideth;

   The Spirit and the gifts are ours

   Through him who with us sideth:

   Let goods and kindred go,

   This mortal life also;

   The body they may kill:

   God's truth abideth still,

   His kingdom is for ever.

214. God is our stronghold and our stay

   P.M.

   [835]Ein Feste Burg:

   Martin Luther, 1529

   Psalm 46

   Version by Elizabeth Wordsworth, 1903


   God is our stronghold and our stay,

   Our hope in tribulation;

   What though the mountains rock and sway

   To earth's long-hid foundation?

   What though the ocean roar,

   Fast gaining on the shore,

   The hurtling storm rage loud

   Beneath the thunder cloud?

   Our hearts are all untroubled.


   The might of water sinks to rest;

   How calm yon river glideth,

   God's city mirrored on its breast,

   The house where he abideth!

   Hushed be all strife and din!

   His presence dwells within,

   She standeth unremoved,

   By God himself beloved,

   Who helpeth her right early.


   In vain the heathen shout for war,

   In vain our foes assemble;

   The voice of God is heard from far,

   And earth itself shall tremble.

   He breaks the spear and bow,

   He lays the warrior low,

   The chariot burns with flame;

   Our trust is in his Name,

   And Jacob's God our refuge!


   Be still, the Lord is God alone,

   Let all the world adore him,

   And bending low before his throne,

   For pitying grace implore him.

   His kingdom is within,

   O'er hearts made pure from sin,

   Where love that casts out fear

   Exults to feel him near,

   The Lord of hosts our refuge.

   Charles Wesley, 1742


   Jesus, my strength, my hope,

   On Thee I cast my care;

   With humble confidence look up,

   And know Thou hear'st my prayer.

   Give me on Thee to wait,

   Till I can all things do;

   On Thee, almighty to create,

   Almighty to renew.


   Give me a true regard,

   A single, steady aim,

   Unmoved by threatening or reward,

   To Thee and Thy great Name;

   A jealous, just concern

   For Thine immortal praise;

   A pure desire that all may learn

   And glorify Thy grace.


   I rest upon Thy word;

   The promise is for me;

   My succour and salvation, Lord,

   Shall surely come from Thee:

   But let me still abide,

   Nor from my hope remove,

   Till Thou my patient spirit guide

   Into Thy perfect love.


   Amen.

216. God moves in a mysterious way

   C.M.

   [839]London New:

   Scottish Psalter, 1635

   [840]St. Anne:

   William Croft, 1708

   William Cowper, 1774


   God moves in a mysterious way

   His wonders to perform:

   He plants His footsteps in the sea

   And rides upon the storm.


   Deep in unfathomable mines,

   With never-failing skill,

   He treasures up His bright designs,

   And works His sovereign will.


   Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;

   The clouds ye so much dread

   Are big with mercy, and shall break

   In blessings on your head.


   Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,

   But trust Him for his grace;

   Behind a frowning providence

   He hides a smiling face.


   His purposes will ripen fast,

   Unfolding every hour:

   The bud may have a bitter taste,

   But sweet will be the flower.


   Blind unbelief is sure to err,

   And scan His work in vain;

   God is His own interpreter,

   And He will make it plain.

   Rock of ages, cleft for me,

   Let me hide myself in Thee;

   Let the water and the blood

   From Thy side, a healing flood,

   Be of sin the double cure,

   Save from wrath, and make me pure.


   Should my tears for ever flow,

   Should my zeal no languor know,

   All for sin could not atone,

   Thou must save, and Thou alone;

   In my hand no price I bring,

   Simply to Thy cross I cling.


   While I draw this fleeting breath,

   When mine eyelids close in death,

   When I rise to worlds unknown,

   And behold thee on thy throne,

   Rock of ages, cleft for me,

   Let me hide myself in Thee.

   Jesus, I die to Thee,

   Whenever death shall come;

   To die in Thee is life to me,

   In my eternal home.


   Whether to live or die,

   I know not which is best;

   To live in Thee is bliss to me,

   To die is endless rest.


   Living or dying, Lord,

   I ask but to be Thine;

   My life in Thee, Thy life in me,

   Makes heaven for ever mine.

   Let Thy love my heart inflame;

   Keep Thy fear before my sight;

   Be Thy smile my chief delight.


   Fountain of o'erflowing grace,

   Freely from Thy fullness give;

   Till I close my earthly race,

   May I prove it "Christ to live."


   Firmly trusting in Thy blood,

   Nothing shall my heart confound;

   Safely I shall pass the flood,

   Safely reach Emmanuel's ground.


   Thus, O thus, an entrance give

   To the land of cloudless sky;

   Having known it "Christ to live,"

   Let me know it "gain to die."

   Arthur S. Sullivan (1842-1900)

   Anna L. Waring, 1849


   My heart is resting, O my God,

   I will give thanks and sing;

   My heart is at the secret source

   Of every precious thing.


   Now the frail vessel Thou hast made,

   No hand but Thine shall fill;

   The waters of the earth have failed,

   And I am thirsty still.


   I thirst for springs of heavenly life,

   And here all day they rise;

   I seek the treasure of Thy love,

   And close at hand it lies.


   And a new song is in my mouth,

   To long-loved music set;

   Glory to Thee for all the grace

   I have not tasted yet.


   I have a heritage of joy,

   That yet I must not see;

   The hand that bled to make it mine

   Is keeping it for me.


   There is a certainty of love

   That sets my heart at rest;

   A calm assurance for today,

   That to be poor is best;


   A prayer, reposing on his truth,

   Who hath made all things mine,

   That draws my captive will to him,

   And makes it one with thine.

   Steps unto heaven;

   All that Thou sendest me

   In mercy given;

   Angels to beckon me

   Nearer, my God, to Thee,

   Nearer to Thee.


   Then with my waking thoughts

   Bright with Thy praise,

   Out of my stony griefs

   Bethel I'll raise;

   Nearer, my God, to Thee,

   Nearer to Thee.


   Or if on joyful wing,

   Cleaving the sky,

   Sun, moon, and stars forgot,

   Still all my song shall be,

   Nearer, my God, to Thee,

   Nearer to Thee.

   In heavenly love abiding,

   No change my heart shall fear,

   For nothing changes here.

   The storm may roar without me,

   My heart may low be laid;

   But God is round about me,

   And can I be dismayed?


   Wherever He may guide me,

   No want shall turn me back;

   My Shepherd is beside me,

   And nothing can I lack.

   His wisdom ever waketh,

   His sight is never dim;

   He knows the way He taketh,

   And I will walk with Him.


   Green pastures are before me,

   Which yet I have not seen;

   Bright skies will soon be o'er me,

   Where the dark clouds have been.

   My hope I cannot measure,

   The path to life is free;

   My Savior has my treasure,

   And He will walk with me.

   8.8.8.8.6

   [900]Mallett:

   Walter Henry Hall, 1918

   George Matheson, 1882


   O Love that wilt not let me go,

   I rest my weary soul in thee;

   I give thee back the life I owe,

   That in thine ocean depths its flow

   May richer, fuller be.


   O Light that followest all my way,

   I yield my flickering torch to thee;

   My heart restores its borrowed ray,

   That in thy sunshine's blaze its day

   May brighter, fairer be.


   O Joy that seekest me through pain,

   I cannot close my heart to thee;

   I trace the rainbow through the rain,

   And feel the promise is not vain

   That morn shall tearless be.


   O Cross that liftest up my head,

   I dare not ask to fly from thee;

   I lay in dust life's glory dead,

   And from the ground there blossoms red

   Life that shall endless be.


   Amen.

   C.M.

   [909]Tallis' Ordinal:

   Thomas Tallis, 1567

   Joseph Addison, 1712;

   Abbr.


   When all thy mercies, O my God,

   My rising soul surveys,

   Transported with the view, I'm lost

   In wonder, love, and praise.


   O how shall words with equal warmth

   The gratitude declare,

   That glows within my ravished heart?

   But thou canst read it there.


   Ten thousand thousand precious gifts

   My daily thanks employ;

   Nor is the least a cheerful heart,

   That tastes those gifts with joy.


   Through every period of my life

   Thy goodness I'll pursue;

   And after death, in distant worlds,

   The glorious theme renew.


   When nature fails, and day and night

   Divide thy works no more,

   My ever grateful heart, O Lord,

   Thy mercy shall adore.


   Through all eternity, to thee

   A joyful song I'll raise;

   But O eternity's too short

   To utter all thy praise!

   [911]Thy Life:

   George A. Macfarren, 1875

   Frances R. Havergal, 1858


   Thy life was given for me,

   Thy blood, O Lord, was shed,

   That I might ransomed be,

   And quickened from the dead;

   Thy life was given for me:

   What have I given for thee?


   Long years were spent for me

   In weariness and woe,

   That through eternity

   Thy glory I might know.

   Long years were spent for me:

   Have I spent one for thee?


   Thy Father's home of light

   Thy rainbow-circled throne,

   Were left for earthly night,

   For wanderings sad and lone.

   Yea, all was left for me:

   Have I left aught for thee?


   And thou hast brought to me,

   Down from thy home above,

   Salvation full and free,

   Thy pardon and thy love.

   Great gifts thou broughtest me:

   What have I brought to thee?


   O let my life be given,

   My years for thee be spent;

   World fetters all be riven,

   And joy with suffering blent;

   Thou gavest thyself for me:

   I give myself to thee.

   7.6.7.6 D.

   [913]Magdalena:

   John Stainer, 1868

   Frances R. Havergal, 1873


   I could not do without Thee,

   O Savior of the lost,

   Whose precious blood redeemed me

   At such tremendous cost;

   Thy righteousness, thy pardon,

   Thy precious blood, must be

   My only hope and comfort,

   My glory and my plea.


   I could not do without thee,

   I cannot stand alone,

   I have no strength or goodness,

   No wisdom of my own;

   But thou, beloved Savior,

   Art all in all to me,

   And weakness will be power

   If leaning hard on thee.


   I could not do without thee,

   For O the way is long,

   And I am often weary,

   And sigh replaces song:

   How could I do without thee?

   I do not know the way;

   Thou knowest, and thou leadest,

   And wilt not let me stray.


   I could not do without thee,

   O Jesus, Savior dear;

   E'en when my eyes are holden,

   I know that thou art near.

   How dreary and how lonely

   This changeful life would be,

   Without the sweet communion,

   The secret rest with thee!


   I could not do without thee;

   No other friend can read

   The spirit's strange deep longings,

   Interpreting its need;

   No human heart could enter

   Each dim recess of mine,

   And soothe, and hush, and calm it,

   O blessed Lord, but thine.


   I could not do without thee,

   For years are fleeting fast,

   And soon in solemn loneness

   The river must be passed;

   But thou wilt never leave me,

   And though the waves roll high,

   I know thou wilt be near me,

   And whisper, "It is I."


   Amen.

   8.7.8.7 D.

   [915]Beecher:

   John Zundel, 1870

   Frederick W. Faber, 1862;

   cento.


   There's a wideness in God's mercy

   Like the wideness of the sea;

   There's a kindness in his justice

   Which is more than liberty.

   There is welcome for the sinner,

   And more graces for the good;

   There is mercy with the Savior;

   There is healing in his blood.


   There is no place where earth's sorrows

   Are more felt than up in heaven;

   There is no place where earth's failings

   Have such kindly judgment given.

   There is plentiful redemption

   In the blood that has been shed;

   There is joy for all the members

   In the sorrows of the Head.


   For the love of God is broader

   Than the measure of man's mind;

   And the heart of the Eternal

   Is most infinitely kind.

   If our love were but more simple,

   We should take him at his word;

   And our lives would be all sunshine

   In the sweetness of the Lord.

   Eternal Light! Eternal Light!

   How pure that soul must be,

   When, placed within thy searching sight,

   It shrinks not, but with calm delight

   Can live, and look on thee.


   The spirits that surround thy throne

   May bear the burning bliss;

   But surely that is theirs alone

   Who, undefiled, have never known

   A fallen world like this.


   O how shall I, whose native sphere

   Is dark, whose mind is dim,

   Before the Ineffable appear,

   And on my naked spirit bear

   The uncreated beam?


   There is a way for man to rise

   To that sublime abode:

   An offering and a sacrifice,

   A Holy Spirit's energies,

   An Advocate with God:


   These, these prepare us for the sight

   Of holiness above:

   The sons of ignorance and night

   May dwell in the eternal Light,

   Through the eternal Love!

   I heard the voice of Jesus say,

   Come unto me and rest;

   Lay down Thy head upon my breast.

   I came to Jesus as I was,

   Weary, and worn, and sad;

   I found in him a resting-place,

   And he has made me glad.


   I heard the voice of Jesus say,

   Behold, I freely give

   The living water; thirsty one,

   Stoop down and drink, and live.

   I came to Jesus, and I drank

   Of that life-giving stream;

   My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,

   And now I live in him.


   I heard the voice of Jesus say,

   I am this dark world's light;

   Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,

   And all thy day be bright.

   I looked to Jesus, and I found

   In him my Star, my Sun;

   And in that light of life I'll walk

   Till traveling days are done.

   Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.

   His faithful follower I would be,

   For by his hand he leadeth me.


   Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,

   Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,

   By waters calm, o'er troubled sea,

   Still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.


   Lord, I would clasp thy hand in mine,

   Nor ever murmur nor repine;

   Content, whatever lot I see,

   Since 'tis my God that leadeth me.


   And when my task on earth is done,

   When, by thy grace, the victory's won,

   Dim tracts of time divide

   Thy voice comes strange o'er years of change;

   Comes faint and far thy voice

   From vales of Galilee;

   Thy vision fades in ancient shades;

   How should we follow thee?


   O heavy cross: of faith

   In what we cannot see!

   As once of yore thyself restore,

   And help to follow thee.


   If not as once thou cam'st

   In true humanity,

   Come yet as guest within the breast

   That burns to follow thee.

   In nearest nearness be:

   Lead us, O Father, in the paths of truth;

   While passion stains, and folly dims our youth,

   And age comes on, uncheered by faith and hope.


   Lead us, O Father, in the paths of right;

   Blindly we stumble when we walk alone,

   Involved in shadows of a darksome night,

   Only with thee we journey safely on.


   Lead us, O Father, to thy heavenly rest,

   However rough and steep the path may be,

   Through joy or sorrows as thou deemest best,

   Until our lives are perfected in thee.

   Confirm the tidings as they roll,

   And spread the truth from pole to pole.


   What though in solemn silence all

   Move round this dark terrestrial ball;

   What though no real voice nor sound

   Amidst their radiant orbs be found;

   In reason's ear they all rejoice,

   And utter forth a glorious voice;

   "The Hand that made us is divine."

255. O Worship the King, all glorious above

   10.10.11.11

   [978]Hanover:

   William Croft, 1708

   Psalm 104

   Robert Grant, 1833


   O Worship the King, all glorious above!

   O gratefully sing his power and his love!

   Our shield and defender, the Ancient of days,

   Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.


   O tell of his might! O sing of his grace!

   Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space.

   His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,

   And dark is his path on the wings of the storm.


   The earth, with its store of wonders untold,

   Almighty, thy power hath founded of old,

   Hath 'stablished it fast by a changeless decree,

   And round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.


   Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?

   It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;

   It streams from the hills; it descends to the plain,

   And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.


   Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,

   In thee do we trust, nor find thee to fail;

   Thy mercies, how tender! how firm to the end!

   Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!


   O measureless Might! ineffable Love!

   While angels delight to hymn thee above,

   The humbler creation, though feeble their lays,

   With true adoration shall sing to thy praise.


   Amen.

256. Songs of praise the angels sang

   Four 7's

   [980]Innocents:

   Arr. from G. F. Handel, 1728

   James Montgomery, 1819


   Songs of praise the angels sang,

   Heaven with alleluias rang,

   When Jehovah's work begun,

   When he spake and it was done.


   Songs of praise awoke the morn,

   When the Prince of Peace was born;

   Songs of praise arose when He

   Captive led captivity.


   Heaven and earth must pass away;

   Songs of praise shall crown that day:

   God will make new heavens and earth;

   Songs of praise shall hail their birth.


   And shall man alone be dumb,

   Till that glorious kingdom come?

   No; the Church delights to raise

   Psalms, and hymns, and songs of praise.


   Saints below, with heart and voice,

   Still in songs of praise rejoice;

   Learning here, by faith and love,

   Songs of praise to sing above.


   Borne upon their latest breath,

   Songs of praise shall conquer death

   Then, amidst eternal joy,

   Songs of praise their powers employ.

   Four 7's

   [982]St. Bees:

   John Bacchus Dykes, 1862

   Anonymous, 1800


   Sing, my soul, his wondrous love,

   Who, from yon bright throne above,

   Ever watchful o'er our race,

   Still to man extends his grace.


   Heaven and earth by him were made;

   All is by his scepter swayed;

   What are we that he should show

   So much love to us below?


   God, the merciful and good,

   Bought us with the Savior's blood,

   And, to make our safety sure,

   Guides us by his Spirit pure.


   Sing, my soul, adore his Name!

   Let his glory be thy theme:

   Praise him till he calls thee home;

   Trust his love for all to come.

   Father-like he tends and spares us;

   Well our feeble frame he knows;

   In his hand he gently bears us,

   Rescues us from all our foes.

259. Praise to the Holiest in the height

   C.M.

   [986]Gerontius:

   John B. Dykes, 1868

   John Henry Newman, 1865


   Praise to the Holiest in the height,

   And in the depth be praise;

   In all his words most wonderful,

   Most sure in all his ways!


   O loving wisdom of our God!

   When all was sin and shame,

   A second Adam to the fight

   And to the rescue came.


   O wisest love! that flesh and blood,

   Which did in Adam fail,

   Should strive afresh against the foe,

   Should strive and should prevail:


   And that a higher gift than grace

   Should flesh and blood refine;

   God's Presence and his very Self,

   And Essence all-divine.


   O generous love! that he who smote

   In Man for man the foe,

   The double agony in Man

   For man should undergo;


   And in the garden secretly,

   And on the cross on high,

   Should teach his brethren, and inspire

   To suffer and to die.


   Praise to the Holiest in the height,

   And in the depth be praise;

   In all his words most wonderful,

   Most sure in all his ways.

   Alt.


   O for a heart to praise my God,

   A heart from sin set free!

   A heart that's sprinkled with the blood

   So freely shed for me;


   A heart resigned, submissive, meek,

   My dear Redeemer's throne,

   Where only Christ is heard to speak,

   Where Jesus reigns alone;


   An humble, lowly, contrite heart,

   Believing, true, and clean;

   Which neither life nor death can part

   From him that dwells within.


   A heart in every thought renewed,

   And full of love divine,

   Perfect, and right, and pure, and good,

   A copy, Lord, of thine!


   Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;

   Come quickly from above;

   Write thy new Name upon my heart,

   Thy new, best name of Love.

   Thy reign extend world without end,

   Let praise from all to thee ascend.

   O could I speak the matchless worth,

   O could I sound the glories forth

   Which in my Savior shine,

   I'd soar, and touch the heavenly strings,

   And vie with Gabriel while he sings

   In notes almost divine.


   I'd sing the characters he bears,

   And all the forms of love he wears,

   Exalted on his throne:

   In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,

   I would to everlasting days

   Make all his glories known.


   O the delightful day will come

   When my dear Lord will bring me home,

   And I shall see his face;

   Then with my Savior, Brother, Friend,

   A blest eternity I'll spend,

   Triumphant in his grace.

   GENERAL ENDING

   Horatio Nelson, 1864


   From all thy saints in warfare, for all thy saints at rest,

   To thee, O blessed Jesus, all praises be addressed.

   Thou, Lord, didst win the battle that they might conquerors be;

   Their crowns of living glory are lit with rays from thee.


   Praise, Lord, for thine apostle, the first to welcome thee,

   The first to lead his brother the very Christ to see.

   With hearts for thee made ready, watch we throughout the year,

   Forward to lead our brethren to own thine Advent near.


   All praise for thine apostle, whose short-lived doubtings prove

   Thy perfect twofold nature, the fullness of thy love.

   On all who wait thy coming shed forth thy peace, O Lord,

   And grant us faith to know thee, true Man, true God, adored.


   Praise for the first of martyrs, who saw thee ready stand

   To aid in midst of torments, to plead at God's right hand.

   Share we with him, if summoned by death our Lord to own,

   On earth the faithful witness, in heaven the martyr crown.


   Praise for the loved disciple, exile on Patmos' shore;

   Praise for the faithful record he to thy Godhead bore,

   Praise for the mystic vision through him to us revealed.

   May we, in patience waiting, with thine elect be sealed.


   Praise for thine infant martyrs, by thee with tenderest love

   Called early from the warfare to share the rest above.

   O Rachel! cease thy weeping: they rest from pains and cares.

   Lord, grant us hearts as guileless and crowns as bright as theirs.


   Praise for the light from heaven, praise for the voice of awe,

   Praise for the glorious vision the persecutor saw.

   Thee, Lord, for his conversion, we glorify today;

   So lighten all our darkness with thy true Spirit's ray.


   Lord, thine abiding presence directs the wondrous choice;

   For one in place of Judas the faithful now rejoice.

   Thy Church from false apostles for evermore defend,

   And by thy parting promise be with her to the end.


   For him, O Lord, we praise thee, the weak by grace made strong,

   Whose labors and whose Gospel enrich our triumph song.

   May we in all our weakness find strength from thee supplied,

   And all, as fruitful branches, in thee, the Vine, abide.


   All praise for thine apostle, blest guide to Greek and Jew,

   And him surnamed thy brother; keep us thy brethren true,

   And grant us grace to know thee, the Way, the Truth, the Life;

   To wrestle with temptations till victors in the strife.


   The son of Consolation, moved by thy law of love,

   Forsaking earthly treasures, sought riches from above.

   As earth now teems with increase, let gifts of grace descend,

   That thy true consolations may through the world extend.


   We praise thee for the Baptist, forerunner of the Word,

   Our true Elias, making a highway for the Lord.

   Of prophets last and greatest, he saw thy dawning ray:

   Make us the rather blessed who love thy glorious day.


   Praise for thy great apostle, the eager and the bold;

   Thrice falling, yet repentant, thrice charged to keep thy Fold.

   Lord, make thy pastors faithful to guard their flocks from ill,

   And grant them dauntless courage, with humble, earnest will.


   For him, O Lord, we praise thee, who, slain by Herod's sword,

   Drank of thy cup of suffering, fulfilling thus thy word.

   Curb we all vain impatience to read thy veiled decree,

   And count it joy to suffer, if so brought nearer thee.


   All praise for thine apostle, the faithful, pure, and true,

   Whom underneath the fig tree thine eye all-seeing knew.

   Like him may we be guileless, true Israelites indeed,

   That thy abiding presence our longing souls may feed.


   Praise, Lord, for him whose Gospel thy human life declared,

   Who, worldly gains forsaking, thy path of suffering shared.

   From all unrighteous mammon O give us hearts set free,

   That we, whate'er our calling, may rise and follow thee.


   For that "beloved physician," all praise, whose Gospel shows

   The Healer of the nations, the Sharer of our woes.

   Thy wine and oil, O Savior, on bruised hearts deign to pour,

   And with true balm of Gilead anoint us evermore.


   Praise, Lord, for thine apostles, who sealed their faith today:

   One love, one zeal impelled them to tread the sacred way.

   May we with zeal as earnest the faith of Christ maintain,

   And, bound in love as brethren, at length thy rest attain.


   Apostles, prophets, martyrs, and all the sacred throng,

   Who wear the spotless raiment, who raise the ceaseless song;

   For these, passed on before us, Savior, we thee adore,

   And, walking in their footsteps, would serve thee more and more.


   Then praise we God the Father, and praise we God the Son,

   And God the Holy Spirit, eternal Three in One;

   Till all the ransomed number fall down before the throne,

   And honour, power, and glory ascribe to God alone.


   Amen.

   Jesus calls us; o'er the tumult

   Day by day his sweet voice soundeth,

   Saying, "Christian, follow me."


   As of old, Saint Andrew heard it

   By the Galilean lake,

   Turned from home, and toil, and kindred,

   Leaving all for his dear sake.


   Jesus calls us from the worship

   Of the vain world's golden store;

   From each idol that would keep us,

   Saying, "Christian, love me more."


   In our joys and in our sorrows,

   Days of toil and hours of ease,

   Still he calls, in cares and pleasures,

   "That we love him more than these."


   Jesus calls us: by thy mercies,

   Savior, make us hear thy call,

   Give our hearts to thine obedience,

   Serve and love thee best of all.

   Lord, teach thy Church the lesson,

   May in thy ransom share:


   When foes thy Church's power defy,

   Or slight thy sacred word,

   Or thee, true God and Man, deny,

   Grant them conversion, Lord.


   Grant that the light may round them shine;

   That, set from error free,

   They in thy word the truth divine,

   Thee in thy Church may see;


   That so, when our brief time is done,

   We may with them adore

   The Father, and coequal Son,

   And Spirit evermore.


   Amen.

   The traitor's secret fall;

   Our own ascended Master,

   Who heard his Church's cry,

   Elect in his foreknowledge,

   To fill the lost one's place;

   By hidden gifts of grace;

   He lifted up the poor,

   And set him with the Princes

   On high for evermore.


   Still guide thy Church, chief Shepherd,

   Her losses still renew;

   Be thy dread keys entrusted

   To faithful hands and true;

   Apostles of thy choosing

   May all her rulers be

   That each with joy may render

   His last account to thee!

   What thanks and praise to thee we owe,

   O Priest and Sacrifice divine,

   For thy dear saint through whom we know

   So many a gracious word of thine;


   Whom thou didst choose to tell the tale

   Of all thy manhood's toils and tears,

   And for a moment lift the veil

   That hides thy boyhood's spotless years.


   And still the Church through all her days

   Uplifts the strains that never cease,

   The blessèd Virgin's hymn of praise,

   The aged Simeon's words of peace.


   O happy saint! whose sacred page,

   So rich in words of truth and love,

   Pours on the Church from age to age

   This healing unction from above;


   The witness of the Savior's life,

   The great apostle's chosen friend

   Through weary years of toil and strife,

   And still found faithful to the end.


   So grant us, Lord, like him to live,

   Beloved by man, approved by thee,

   Till thou at last the summons give,

   And we, with him, thy face shall see.

   For all the saints, who from their labors rest,

   Who thee by faith before the world confessed,

   Thy Name, O Jesus, be for ever blessed,


   Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress, and their Might:

   Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;

   Thou, in the darkness drear, the one true Light.


   O may thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,

   Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,

   And win, with them, the victor's crown of gold.


   O blest communion, fellowship divine!

   We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;

   Yet all are one in thee, for all are thine.


   And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,

   Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,

   And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.


   The golden evening brightens in the west;

   Soon, soon to faithful warriors cometh rest;

   Sweet is the calm of Paradise the blest.


   But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;

   The saints triumphant rise in bright array;

   The King of glory passes on his way.


   From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,

   Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,

   Singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,


   Alleluia, Alleluia!

   Alleluia! hark, they sing,

   Praising loud their heavenly King.


   Who are these of dazzling brightness,

   These in God's own truth arrayed,

   Clad in robes of purest whiteness,

   Robes whose luster ne'er shall fade,

   Ne'er be touched by time's rude hand?

   Whence comes all this glorious band?


   These are they who have contended

   For their Savior's honour long,

   Wrestling on till life was ended,

   Following not the sinful throng:

   These, who well the fight sustained,

   Triumph by the Lamb have gained.


   These are they whose hearts were riven,

   Sore with woe and anguish tried,

   Who in prayer full oft have striven

   With the God they glorified:

   Now, their painful conflict o'er,

   God has bid them weep no more.


   These, like priests, have watched and waited,

   Offering up to Christ their will,

   Soul and body consecrated,

   Day and night they serve him still.

   Now in God's most holy place,

   Blest they stand before his face.

   Part of the host have crossed the flood,

   And part are crossing now.


   E'en now to their eternal home

   There pass some spirits blest;

   While others to the margin come,

   Endured the cross, despised the shame,

   Once they were mourning here below,

   And wet their couch with tears;

   They wrestled hard, as we do now,

   With sins, and doubts, and fears.


   I ask them whence their victory came;

   They, with united breath,

   Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,

   Their triumph to his death.


   They marked the footsteps that he trod,

   His zeal inspired their breast;

   And, following their incarnate God,

   Possess the promised rest.

   While the long cloud of witnesses

   He, Ransomer from death, and Light from shade

   Now gives his holy grace, his saints to aid.


   Approach ye then with faithful hearts sincere,

   And take the safeguard of salvation here.


   He, that his saints in this world rules and shields,

   To all believers life eternal yields;


   With heavenly bread makes them that hunger whole,

   Gives living waters to the thirsting soul.


   Alpha and Omega, to whom shall bow

   All nations at the doom, is with us now.

   Now, my tongue, the mystery telling

   Of the glorious Body sing,

   And the Blood, all price excelling,

   Which the Gentiles' Lord and King,

   Once on earth amongst us dwelling,

   Shed for this world's ransoming!


   Given for us and condescending

   To be born for us below,

   He with men in converse blending

   Dwelt, the seed of truth to sow,

   Till he closed with wondrous ending

   His most patient life of woe.


   That last night at supper lying,

   Mid the Twelve, his chosen band,

   Jesus, with the Law complying,

   Keeps the Feast its rites demand;

   Then, more precious food supplying,

   Gives himself with his own hand.


   Word-made-flesh true bread he maketh

   By his word his Flesh to be;

   Wine his Blood; which whoso taketh

   Must from carnal thoughts be free;

   Faith alone, though sight forsaketh,

   Shows true hearts the mystery.


   Therefore we, before him bending,

   This great Sacrament revere;

   Types and shadows have their ending,

   For the newer rite is here;

   Faith, our outward sense befriending,

   Makes our inward vision clear.


   Glory let us give and blessing

   To the Father and the Son,

   Honour, thanks, and praise addressing,

   While eternal ages run;

   Ever too his love confessing

   Who from Both with Both is One.

   As of old on earth he stood

   Lord of lords, in human vesture --

   In the Body and the Blood --

   He will give to all the faithful

   His own self for heavenly food.


   Rank on rank the host of heaven

   Spreads its vanguard on the way,

   As the Light of Light descendeth

   From the realms of endless day,

   That the powers of hell may vanish

   As the darkness clears away.


   At his feet the six-winged seraph;

   Cherubim with sleepless eye,

   Veil their faces to the Presence,

   As with ceaseless voice they cry,

   Alleluia, Lord most high.

   8.7.8.7.7.7

   [1350]Irby:

   Henry J. Gauntlett, 1858

   Cecil Frances Alexander, 1848


   Once in royal David's city

   Stood a lowly cattle shed,

   Where a mother laid her baby,

   In a manger for his bed:

   Mary was that mother mild,

   Jesus Christ her little child.


   He came down to earth from heaven,

   Who is God and Lord of all,

   And his shelter was a stable,

   And his cradle was a stall;

   With the poor, and mean, and lowly,

   Lived on earth our Savior holy.


   And, through all his wondrous childhood,

   He would honour and obey,

   Love, and watch the lowly maiden

   In whose gentle arms he lay;

   Christian children all must be

   Mild, obedient, good as he.


   For he is our childhood's pattern;

   Day by day like us he grew;

   He was little, weak, and helpless,

   Tears and smiles like us he knew,

   And he feeleth for our sadness,

   And he shareth in our gladness.


   And our eyes at last shall see him,

   Through his own redeeming love;

   For that child so dear and gentle

   Is our Lord in heaven above;

   And he leads his children on

   To the place where he is gone.


   Not in that poor lowly stable,

   With the oxen standing by,

   We shall see him; but in heaven,

   Set at God's right hand on high;

   When like stars his children crowned,

   All in white shall wait around.

   11.8.12.9

   [1352]Luke:

   Greek Folksong;

   Arr. William B. Bradbury, 1859;

   Harm. Winfred Douglas, 1918

   Jemima Luke, 1841


   I think when I read that sweet story of old,

   When Jesus was here among men,

   How he called little children as lambs to his fold,

   I should like to have been with them then.


   I wish that his hands had been placed on my head,

   That his arms had been thrown around me,

   And that I might have seen his kind look when he said,

   "Let the little ones come unto me."


   Yet still to his footstool in prayer I may go,

   And ask for a share in his love;

   And if I thus earnestly seek him below,

   I shall see him and hear him above,


   In that beautiful place he has gone to prepare

   For all who are washed and forgiven;

   And many dear children shall be with him there,

   For "of such is the kingdom of heaven."


   But thousands and thousands who wander and fall,

   Never heard of that heavenly home;

   I wish they could know there is room for them all,

   And that Jesus has bid them to come.

   C.M.

   [1354]Bishopthorpe:

   Jeremiah Clark, 1700

   Reginald Heber, 1812


   By cool Siloam's shady rill

   How fair the lily grows!

   How sweet the breath, beneath the hill,

   Of Sharon's dewy rose!


   Lo! such the child whose early feet

   The paths of peace have trod,

   Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,

   Is upward drawn to God.


   By cool Siloam's shady rill

   The lily must decay;

   The rose that blooms beneath the hill

   Must shortly fade away.


   And soon, too soon, the wintry hour

   Of man's maturer age

   Will shake the soul with sorrow's power,

   And stormy passion's rage.


   O thou whose infant feet were found

   Within thy Father's shrine,

   Whose years, with changeless virtue crowned,

   Were all alike divine,


   Dependent on thy bounteous breath,

   We seek thy grace alone,

   In childhood, manhood, age, and death,

   To keep us still thine own.


   Amen.

   Again the morn of gladness,

   The morn of light is here;

   The earth itself looks fairer,

   And heaven itself more near;

   The bells, like angel voices,

   Speak peace to every breast:

   And all the land lies quiet

   To keep the day of rest.


   Glory be to Jesus,

   Let all his children say;

   He rose again, he rose again,

   On this glad day.


   Again, O loving Savior,

   The children of thy grace

   Prepare themselves to seek thee

   Within thy chosen place.

   Our song shall rise to greet thee,

   If thou our hearts wilt raise;

   If thou our lips wilt open,

   Our mouth shall show thy praise.


   The shining choir of angels

   That rest not day or night,

   The crowned and palm-decked martyrs,

   The saints arrayed in white,

   The happy lambs of Jesus

   In pastures fair above--

   These all adore and praise him,

   Whom we too praise and love.


   The Church on earth rejoices

   To join with these today;

   In every tongue and nation

   She calls her sons to pray;

   Across the northern snow-fields,

   Beneath the Indian palms,

   She makes the same pure offering,

   And sings the same sweet psalms.


   Tell out, sweet bells, his praises!

   Sing, children, sing his Name!

   Still louder and still farther

   His mighty deeds proclaim,

   Till all whom he redeemèd

   Shall own him Lord and King,

   Till every knee shall worship,

   And every tongue shall sing,

   All things bright and beautiful,

   All creatures great and small,

   All things wise and wonderful,

   The Lord God made them all.


   Each little flower that opens,

   Each little bird that sings,

   He made their glowing colors,

   He made their tiny wings.


   The purple-headed mountain,

   The river running by,

   The sunset, and the morning

   That brightens up the sky,


   All things bright and beautiful,

   All creatures great and small,

   All things wise and wonderful,

   The Lord God made them all.


   The cold wind in the winter,

   The pleasant summer sun,

   The ripe fruits in the garden,

   He made them every one.


   The tall trees in the greenwood,

   The meadows where we play,

   The rushes by the water,

   We gather every day,


   He gave us eyes to see them,

   And lips that we might tell

   How great is God Almighty,

   Who has made all things well.

   Hushed was the evening hymn,

   The temple courts were dark,

   The lamp was burning dim

   Before the sacred ark,

   When suddenly a voice divine

   Rang through the silence of the shrine.


   The old man, meek and mild,

   The priest of Israel, slept;

   His watch the temple-child,

   The little Levite, kept;

   And what from Eli's sense was sealed,

   The Lord to Hannah's son revealed.


   O give me Samuel's ear,

   The open ear, O Lord,

   Alive and quick to hear

   Each whisper of thy word!

   Like him to answer at thy call,

   And to obey thee first of all.


   O give me Samuel's heart,

   A lowly heart, that waits

   Where in thy house thou art,

   Or watches at thy gates!

   By day and night, a heart that still

   Moves at the breathing of thy will.


   O give me Samuel's mind,

   A sweet, unmurmuring faith,

   Obedient and resigned

   To thee in life and death!

   That I may read with childlike eyes

   Truths that are hidden from the wise.

   [1379]Noel:

   English Folksong;

   Arr. Arthur S. Sullivan, 1874

   James Montgomery, 1816


   When Jesus left his Father's throne,

   He chose an humble birth;

   Like us, unhonoured and unknown,

   He came to dwell on earth.

   Like him may we be found below

   In wisdom's path of peace;

   Like him in grace and knowledge grow,

   As years and strength increase.


   Sweet were his words and kind his look,

   When mothers round him pressed;

   Their infants in his arms he took,

   And on his bosom blessed.

   Safe from the world's alluring harms,

   Beneath his watchful eye,

   Thus in the circle of his arms

   May we for ever lie.


   When Jesus into Salem rode,

   The children sang around;

   For joy they plucked the palms and strowed

   Their garments on the ground.

   Hosanna our glad voices raise,

   Hosanna to our King!

   Should we forget our Savior's praise,

   The stones themselves would sing.

   There's a Friend for little children

   This Friend is always worthy

   Of that dear Name he bears.

   A rest from every turmoil,

   From sin and sorrow free,

   Where every little pilgrim

   Shall rest eternally.


   There's a home for little children

   Above the bright blue sky,

   Where Jesus reigns in glory,

   A home of peace and joy;

   No home on earth is like it,

   Nor can with it compare;

   For every one is happy

   Nor could be happier there.


   There's a song for little children

   Above the bright blue sky,

   A song that will not weary,

   Though sung continually;

   A song which even angels

   Can never, never sing;

   They know not Christ as Savior,

   But worship him as King.


   There's a crown for little children

   Above the bright blue sky,

   And all who look for Jesus

   Shall wear it by and by;

   All, all above is treasured,

   And found in Christ alone:

   Lord, grant thy little children

   To know thee as their own.

   Thy sevenfold gifts impart,

   O Comforter most sweet:

   Inflame with zeal each lukewarm heart,

   And guide the trembling feet.


   With Pentecostal force

   Thy presence let us feel:

   With strength, who art thyself its source,

   Inspire us as we kneel.


   Confirm in us today

   The work that thou hast wrought;

   Illume the souls with love's pure ray

   Which Jesus' blood hath bought.


   No earth-forged arms we bear:

   Strength, weapons, all are thine:

   Accept each vow and hear each prayer,

   7.6.7.6.D.

   [1505]Come Unto Me:

   John Bacchus Dykes, 1875

   [1506]Jesu Dilectissime:

   R. H. McCartney (1844-1895)

   William C. Dix, 1867


   "Come unto me, ye weary,

   And I will give you rest."

   O blessed voice of Jesus,

   Which comes to hearts opprest!

   It tells of benediction,

   Of pardon, grace, and peace,

   Of joy that hath no ending,

   Of love that cannot cease.


   "Come unto me, ye wanderers,

   And I will give you light."

   O loving voice of Jesus,

   Which comes to cheer the night!

   Our hearts were filled with sadness,

   And we had lost our way,

   But he has brought us gladness,

   And songs at break of day.


   "Come unto me, ye fainting,

   And I will give you life."

   O cheering voice of Jesus,

   Which comes to aid our strife!

   The foe is stern and eager,

   The fight is fierce and long;

   But Thou hast made us mighty,

   And stronger than the strong.


   "And whosoever cometh,

   I will not cast him out."

   O welcome voice of Jesus,

   Which drives away our doubt!

   Which calls us, very sinners,

   Unworthy though we be

   Of love so free and boundless,

   To come, O Lord, to thee.


   Amen.

   Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.


   Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,

   Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure,

   Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,

   "Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure."


   Here see the Bread of Life; see waters flowing

   Forth from the throne of God, pure from above;

   Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing

   Earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.

   Cease toward the child she bare?

   Yes, she may forgetful be,

   Yet will I remember thee.


   "Mine is an unchanging love,

   Higher than the heights above,

   Deeper than the depths beneath,

   Free and faithful, strong as death.

   When the work of grace is done;

   Partner of my throne shalt be:

   Though dark my path, and sad my lot,

   Let me be still and murmur not,

   Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,


   What though in lonely grief I sigh

   For friends beloved, no longer nigh,

   Submissive still would I reply,


   If thou shoulds't call me to resign

   What most I prize, it ne'er was mine:

   I only yield thee what is thine;


   Let but my fainting heart be blest

   With thy good Spirit for its guest,

   My God, to thee I leave the rest;


   Renew my will from day to day,

   Blend it with thine, and take away

   All that now makes it hard to say,


   Then, when on earth I breathe no more

   The prayer oft mixed with tears before,

   I'll sing upon a happier shore,


   "Thy will be done!"

   Lord, it belongs not to my care

   Whether I die or live;

   To love and serve thee is my share,

   And this thy grace must give.


   If life be long, O make me glad

   The longer to obey;

   If short, no labourer is sad

   To end his toilsome day.


   Christ leads me through no darker rooms

   Than he went through before;

   And he that to God's kingdom comes

   Must enter by this door.


   Come, Lord, when grace hath made me meet

   Thy blessed face to see:

   For if thy work on earth be sweet,

   What will thy glory be?


   Then I shall end my sad complaints

   And weary, sinful days,

   And join with the triumphant saints

   That sing my Savior's praise.


   My knowledge of that life is small,

   The eye of faith is dim;

   But 'tis enough that Christ knows all,

   And I shall be with him.

   O with what joy they went away.


   Once more 'tis eventide, and we

   Oppressed with various ills draw near;

   What if thy form we cannot see?

   We know and feel that thou art here


   O Savior Christ, our woes dispel;

   For some are sick, and some are sad,

   And some have never loved thee well,

   And some have lost the love they had,


   And some have found the world is vain,

   Yet from the world they break not free,

   And some have friends who give them pain,

   Yet have not sought a friend in thee.


   And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,

   For none are wholly free from sin;

   And they who fain would love thee best

   Are conscious most of wrong within.


   O Savior Christ, thou too art Man;

   Thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried,

   Thy kind but searching glance can scan

   The very wounds that shame would hide.


   Thy touch has still its ancient power;

   No word from thee can fruitless fall;

   Hear, in this solemn evening hour,

   And in thy mercy heal us all.

   Thou knowest, Lord, the weariness and sorrow

   Of the sad heart that comes to thee for rest;

   Cares of today, and burdens of tomorrow,

   Blessings implored, and sins to be confessed;

   We come before thee at thy gracious word,

   And lay them at thy feet: thou knowest, Lord.


   Thou knowest all the past; how long and blindly

   On the dark mountains the lost wanderer strayed;

   How the Good Shepherd followed, and how kindly

   He bore it home, upon his shoulders laid;

   And healed the bleeding wounds, and soothed the pain,

   And brought back life, and hope, and strength again.


   Thou knowest all the present; each temptation,

   Each toilsome duty, each foreboding fear;

   All to each one assigned, of tribulation,

   Or to belovèd ones, than self more dear;

   All pensive memories, as we journey on,

   Longings for vanished smiles and voices gone.


   Thou knowest all the future; gleams of gladness

   By stormy clouds too quickly overcast;

   Hours of sweet fellowship and parting sadness,

   And the dark river to be crossed at last.

   O what could hope and confidence afford

   To tread that path, but this? Thou knowest, Lord.


   Thou knowest, not alone as God, all-knowing;

   As Man, our mortal weakness thou hast proved;

   On earth, with purest sympathies o'erflowing,

   O Savior, thou hast wept, and thou hast loved;

   And love and sorrow still to thee may come,

   And find a hiding-place, a rest, a home.


   Therefore we come, thy gentle call obeying,

   And lay our sins and sorrows at thy feet;

   On everlasting strength our weakness staying,

   Clothed in thy robe of righteousness complete:

   Our outward lips confess the Name

   All other names above;

   Love only knoweth whence it came,

   We may not climb the heavenly steeps

   To bring the Lord Christ down;

   In vain we search the lowest deeps,

   For him no depths can drown:


   But warm, sweet, tender, even yet

   A present help is he;

   And faith has still its Olivet,

   And love its Galilee.

   We touch him in life's throng and press,

   We would not mourn them, for we go to thee.

   Round the dear objects it has loved so long,

   And earth from earth can scarce unclasp its fingers;

   And fain would thither flee;

   My heart, O Sion, droops and yearns,

   When I remember thee.


   To thee, to thee I press,

   A dark and toilsome road;

   When shall I pass the wilderness,

   And reach the saints' abode?


   God of my life, be near:

   On thee my hopes I cast:

   O guide me through the desert here,

   And bring me home at last!

   When our heads are bowed with woe,

   Jesus, Son of Mary, hear!


   Thou our throbbing flesh hast worn,

   Thou our mortal griefs hast borne,

   When the solemn death-bell tolls

   For our own departing souls,

   When our final doom is near,

   Thou hast bowed the dying head,

   Thou the blood of life hast shed,

   Thou hast filled a mortal bier;

   Jesus, Son of Mary, hear!


   When the heart is sad within

   With the thought of all its sin,

   When the spirit shrinks with fear,

   Alt., 1867


   God of the living, in whose eyes

   Unveiled thy whole creation lies,

   All souls are thine; we must not say

   That those are dead who pass away,

   From this our world of flesh set free;

   We know them living unto thee.


   Released from earthly toil and strife,

   With thee is hidden still their life;

   Thine are their thoughts, their works, their powers,

   All thine, and yet most truly ours,

   For well we know, where'er they be,

   Our dead are living unto thee.


   Not spilt like water on the ground,

   Not wrapped in dreamless sleep profound,

   Not wandering in unknown despair

   Beyond thy voice, thine arm, thy care;

   Not left to lie like fallen tree;

   Not dead, but living unto thee.


   Thy word is true, thy will is just;

   To thee we leave them, Lord, in trust;

   And bless thee for the love which gave

   Thy Son to fill a human grave,

   That none might fear that world to see

   Where all are living unto thee.


   O Breather into man of breath,

   O Holder of the keys of death,

   O Giver of the life within,

   Save us from death, the death of sin;

   That body, soul, and spirit be

   For ever living unto thee!

   Afred Tennyson, 1889


   Sunset and evening star,

   And one clear call for me!

   And may there be no moaning of the bar

   When I put out to sea,

   But such a tide as moving seems asleep,

   Too full for sound and foam,

   When that which drew from out the boundless deep

   Turns again home.


   Twilight and evening bell,

   And after that the dark!

   And may there be no sadness of farewell

   When I embark;

   For, though from out our bourne of time and place

   The flood may bear me far,

   I hope to see my Pilot face to face

   When I have crossed the bar.

   Asleep in Jesus! O how sweet

   To be for such a slumber meet;

   With holy confidence to sing

   That death hath lost its painful sting!


   Asleep in Jesus! peaceful rest!

   Whose waking is supremely blest;

   No fear, no woe shall dim that hour

   That manifests the Savior's power.


   Asleep in Jesus! O for me

   May such a blissful refuge be!

   Securely shall my ashes lie,

   Waiting the summons from on high.


   Asleep in Jesus! far from thee

   Thy kindred and their graves may be;

   But there is still a blessed sleep,

   From which none ever wakes to weep.

   Land where my fathers died,

   Land of the pilgrims' pride,

   From every mountain side

   Let freedom ring.

   Sweet freedom's song:

   Let rocks their silence break,

   The sound prolong.

   O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,

   What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

   Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,

   O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?

   And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,

   Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

   O say does the Star-spangled Banner yet wave

   O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?


   O thus be it ever, when free men shall stand

   Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!

   Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land

   Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!

   Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,

   And this be our motto, "In God is our trust!"

   And the Star-spangled Banner in triumph shall wave

   O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

   8.7.8.7.D.

   [1663]Ton-y-Botel:

   Welsh Hymn Melody

   James Russell Lowell, 1845;

   cento.


   Once to every man and nation

   Comes the moment to decide,

   In the strife of truth with falsehood,

   For the good or evil side;

   Some great cause, God's new Messiah,

   Offering each the bloom or blight,

   And the choice goes by for ever

   'Twixt that darkness and that light.


   Then to side with truth is noble,

   When we share her wretched crust,

   Ere her cause bring fame and profit,

   And 'tis prosperous to be just;

   Then it is the brave man chooses,

   While the coward stands aside

   Till the multitude make virtue

   Of the faith they had denied.


   By the light of burning martyrs

   Jesus' bleeding feet I track,

   Toiling up new Calvaries ever

   With the cross that turns not back;

   New occasions teach new duties,

   Time makes ancient good uncouth;

   They must upward still and onward

   Who would keep abreast of truth.


   Though the cause of evil prosper,

   Yet 'tis truth alone is strong;

   Though her portion be the scaffold,

   And upon the throne be wrong,

   Yet that scaffold sways the future,

   And, behind the dim unknown,

   Standeth God within the shadow

   Keeping watch above his own.

   Julia Ward Howe, 1862


   Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;

   He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;

   He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword;

   His truth is marching on.

   Glory! glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.


   I have seen him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;

   They have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps;

   I have read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;

   His day is marching on.

   Glory! glory! Hallelujah! His day is marching on.


   I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel;

   "As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;"

   Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,

   Since God is marching on.

   Glory! glory! Hallelujah! Since God is marching on.


   He has sounded forth his trumpet that shall never call retreat;

   He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat;

   O be swift, my soul, to answer him: be jubilant, my feet!

   Our God is marching on.

   Glory! glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.


   In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born, across the sea,

   With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me;

   As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!

   While God is marching on.

   Glory! glory! Hallelujah! While God is marching on.

   C.M.

   [1699]St. Anne:

   William Croft, 1708

   Psalm 90

   Isaac Watts, 1719


   O God, our help in ages past,

   Our hope for years to come,

   Our shelter from the stormy blast,

   And our eternal home:


   Under the shadow of thy throne

   Thy saints have dwelt secure;

   Sufficient is thine arm alone,

   And our defense is sure.


   Before the hills in order stood,

   Or earth received her frame,

   From everlasting thou art God,

   To endless years the same.


   A thousand ages in thy sight

   Are like an evening gone;

   Short as the watch that ends the night

   Before the rising sun.


   Time, like an ever-rolling stream,

   Bears all its sons away;

   They fly, forgotten, as a dream

   Dies at the opening day.


   O God, our help in ages past,

   Our hope for years to come,

   Be thou our Guide while life shall last,

   And our eternal home.


   Amen.

   Our vows, our prayers, we now present

   Before thy throne of grace:

   Our wandering footsteps guide;

   Give us each day our daily bread,

   Till all our wanderings cease,

   And at our Father's loved abode

   Our souls arrive in peace!


   Such blessings from thy gracious hand

   For thy mercy and thy grace,

   Lo! our sins on thee we cast,

   Thee our perfect Sacrifice;

   And, forgetting all the past,

   Press towards our glorious prize.


   Dark the future; let thy light

   Guide us, bright and morning Star:

   Fierce our foes, and hard the fight;

   Arm us, Savior, for the war.


   In our weakness and distress,

   Rock of strength, be thou our stay;

   In the pathless wilderness

   Be our true and living way.


   Who of us death's awful road

   In the coming year shall tread,

   With thy rod and staff, O God,

   Comfort thou his dying bed.


   Keep us faithful, keep us pure,

   Keep us evermore thine own,

   Help, O help us to endure;

   Fit us for the promised crown.

   Father, let me dedicate

   All this year to thee,

   In whatever worldly state

   Thou wilt have me be:

   Not from sorrow, pain, or care

   Freedom dare I claim,

   This alone shall be my prayer,

   Glorify thy Name.


   Can a child presume to choose

   Where or how to live?

   Can a Father's love refuse

   All the best to give?

   More thou givest every day

   Than the best can claim,

   Nor withholdest aught that may

   Glorify thy Name.


   If in mercy thou wilt spare

   Joys that yet are mine;

   If on life, serene and fair,

   Brighter rays may shine;

   Let my glad heart, while it sings,

   Thee in all proclaim,

   And, whate'er the future brings,

   Glorify thy Name.


   If thou callest to the cross,

   And its shadow come,

   Turning all my gain to loss,

   Shrouding heart and home;

   Let me think how thy dear Son

   To his glory came,

   And in deepest woe pray on,

   Glorify thy Name.


   Amen.

   Samuel S. Wesley, 1864

   Samuel J. Stone, 1866


   The Church's one foundation

   Is Jesus Christ her Lord;

   She is his new creation

   By water and the word:

   From heaven he came and sought her

   To be his holy bride;

   With his own blood he bought her,

   And for her life he died.


   Elect from every nation,

   Yet one o'er all the earth,

   Her charter of salvation,

   One Lord, one faith, one birth;

   One holy Name she blesses,

   Partakes one holy food,

   And to one hope she presses,

   With every grace endued.


   Though with a scornful wonder

   Men see her sore opprest,

   By schisms rent asunder,

   By heresies distrest;

   Yet saints their watch are keeping,

   Their cry goes up, "How long?"

   And soon the night of weeping

   Shall be the morn of song.


   'Mid toil and tribulation,

   And tumult of her war,

   She waits the consummation

   Of peace for evermore;

   Till with the vision glorious

   Her longing eyes are blest,

   And the great Church victorious

   Shall be the Church at rest.


   Yet she on earth hath union

   With God the Three in One,

   And mystic sweet communion

   With those whose rest is won.

   O happy ones and holy!

   Lord, give us grace that we

   Like them, the meek and lowly,

   On high may dwell with thee.


   Amen.

   We love the place, O God,

   Wherein thine honour dwells;

   The joy of thine abode

   All other joy excels.


   We love the house of prayer,

   Wherein thy servants meet;

   For thou, O Lord, art there

   Thy chosen ones to greet.


   We love the sacred font,

   Wherein the holy Dove

   Bestows, as ever wont,

   His blessing from above.


   We love thine altar, Lord,

   Its mysteries revere;

   For there, in faith adored,

   We find thy presence near.


   We love thy holy word,

   The lamp thou gav'st to guide

   All wanderers home, O Lord,

   Home to their Father's side.


   Then let us sing the love

   To us so freely given,

   Until we sing above

   The triumph song of heaven!

   Four 10's

   [1790]National Hymn:

   George William Warren, 1892

   Alexander Pope, 1712


   Rise, crowned with light, imperial Salem, rise!

   Exalt thy towering head and lift thine eyes!

   See heaven its sparkling portals wide display,

   And break upon thee in a flood of day.


   See a long race thy spacious courts adorn:

   See future sons, and daughters yet unborn,

   In crowding ranks on every side arise,

   Demanding life, impatient for the skies.


   See barbarous nations at thy gates attend,

   Walk in thy light, and in thy temple bend:

   See thy bright altars thronged with prostrate kings,

   While every land its joyous tribute brings.


   The seas shall waste, the skies to smoke decay,

   Rocks fall to dust, and mountains melt away;

   But fixed his word, his saving power remains;

   Thy realms shall last, thy own Messiah reigns.

   [1792]Maidstone:

   Walter Bond Gilbert, 1862

   Psalm 84

   Henry F. Lyte, 1834


   Pleasant are thy courts above,

   In the land of light and love;

   Pleasant are thy courts below,

   In this land of sin and woe.

   O my spirit longs and faints

   For the converse of thy saints,

   For the brightness of thy face,

   For thy fullness, God of grace!


   Happy birds that sing and fly

   Round thy altars, O Most High!

   Happier souls that find a rest

   In a heavenly Father's breast!

   Like the wandering dove, that found

   No repose on earth around,

   They can to their ark repair

   And enjoy it ever there.


   Happy souls! their praises flow

   Ever in this vale of woe;

   Waters in the desert rise,

   Manna feeds them from the skies:

   On they go from strength to strength

   Till they reach thy throne at length,

   At thy feet adoring fall,

   Who hast led them safe through all.


   Lord, be mine this prize to win;

   Guide me through a world of sin;

   Keep me by thy saving grace;

   Give me at thy side a place.

   Sun and shield alike thou art;

   Guide and guard my erring heart.

   Grace and glory flow from thee;

   Shower, O shower them, Lord, on me!


   Amen.

   Glorious things of thee are spoken,

   Sion, city of our God;

   He whose word cannot be broken,

   Formed thee for his own abode;

   On the Rock of Ages founded,

   What can shake thy sure repose?

   With salvation's walls surrounded,

   Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.


   See, the streams of living waters

   Springing from eternal love,

   Well supply thy sons and daughters,

   And all fear of want remove.

   Who can faint, when such a river

   Ever will their thirst assuage?

   Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,

   Never fails from age to age.


   Round each habitation hovering,

   See the cloud and fire appear

   For a glory and a covering,

   Showing that the Lord is near.

   Thus deriving from their banner,

   Light by night, and shade by day,

   Safe they feed upon the manna,

   Which he gives them when they pray.


   Blest inhabitants of Sion,

   Washed in the Redeemer's blood!

   Jesus, whom their souls rely on,

   Makes them kings and priests to God.

   'Tis his love his people raises

   Over self to reign as kings:

   And as priests, his solemn praises

   Each for a thank-offering brings.

   Hear and receive thy Church's supplication,

   Lord God Almighty.


   See round thine ark the hungry billows curling!

   See how thy foes their banners are unfurling!

   Lord, while their darts envenomed they are hurling,

   Thou canst preserve us.


   Lord, thou canst help when earthly armour faileth;

   Lord, thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth;

   Lord, o'er thy rock nor death nor hell prevaileth:

   Grant us thy peace, Lord!


   Peace, in our hearts, our evil thoughts assuaging,

   Peace, in thy Church, where brothers are engaging,

   Peace, when the world its busy war is waging;

   Calm thy foes raging!


   Grant us thy help till backward they are driven;

   Grant them thy truth, that they may be forgiven;

   Grant peace on earth, and after we have striven,

   Peace in thy heaven.

   How purely hath thy speech come down

   From man's primeval youth;

   How grandly hath thine empire grown

   Of freedom, love, and truth!


   How gleam thy watchfires through the night

   With never-fainting ray!

   How rise thy towers, serene and bright,

   To meet the dawning day!

   In vain the drifting sands:

   Unharmed upon the eternal Rock

   The eternal city stands.

   O where are kings and empires now

   Of old, that went and came?

   But, Lord, thy Church is praying yet,

   A thousand years the same.


   We mark her goodly battlements,

   And her foundations strong;

   We hear within the solemn voice

   Of her unending song.


   For not like kingdoms of the world

   Thy holy Church, O God,

   Though earthquake shocks are threatening her,

   And tempests are abroad;


   Unshaken as eternal hills,

   Immovable she stands,

   A mountain that shall fill the earth,

   A house not made by hands.

   No more shall foes unclean invade,

   And fill thy hallowed walls with dread;

   No more shall hell's insulting host

   Their victory and thy sorrows boast.


   God from on high has heard thy prayer,

   His hand thy ruins shall repair:

   Nor will thy watchful Monarch cease

   To guard thee in eternal peace.

   Jesus, with thy Church abide,

   Be her Savior, Lord, and Guide,

   While on earth her faith is tried:


   Keep her life and doctrine pure,

   Help her, patient to endure,

   Trusting in thy promise sure:


   May her voice be ever clear,

   Warning of a judgment near,

   Telling of a Savior dear:


   All her fettered powers release,

   Bid our strife and envy cease,

   Grant the heavenly gift of peace:


   May she one in doctrine be,

   One in truth and charity,

   Winning all to faith in thee:


   May she guide the poor and blind,

   Seek the lost until she find,

   And the broken-hearted bind:


   Save her love from growing cold,

   Make her watchmen strong and bold,

   Fence her round, thy peaceful fold:


   May her priests thy people feed,

   Shepherds of the flock indeed,

   Ready, where thou call'st, to lead:


   Judge her not for work undone,

   Judge her not for fields unwon,

   Bless her works in thee begun:


   All that she has lost, restore,

   May her strength and zeal be more

   Than in brightest days of yore:


   Raise her to her calling high,

   Let the nations far and nigh

   Hear thy heralds' warning cry:


   May her lamp of truth be bright,

   Bid her bear aloft its light

   Through the realms of heathen night:


   May her scattered children be

   From reproach of evil free,

   Blameless witnesses for thee:


   May she holy triumphs win,

   Overthrow the hosts of sin,

   Gather all the nations in:


   May she soon all glorious be,

   Spotless and from wrinkle free,

   Pure, and bright, and worthy thee.


   We beseech thee, hear us.

   O Sion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,

   To tell to all the world that God is Light;

   That he who made all nations is not willing

   One soul should perish, lost in shades of night:


   Publish glad tidings; tidings of peace;

   Tidings of Jesus, Redemption and release.


   Behold how many thousands still are lying

   Bound in the darksome prison-house of sin,

   With none to tell them of the Savior's dying,

   Or of the life he died for them to win.


   'Tis thine to save from peril of perdition

   The souls for whom the Lord his life laid down;

   Beware lest, slothful to fulfill thy mission,

   Thou lose one jewel that should deck his crown.


   Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation

   That God, in whom they live and move, is Love:

   Tell how he stooped to save his lost creation,

   And died on earth that man might live above.


   Give of thy sons to bear the message glorious;

   Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way,

   Pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;

   And all thou spendest Jesus will repay.


   He comes again! O Sion, ere thou meet him,

   Make known to every heart his saving grace;

   Let none whom he hath ransomed fail to greet him,

   From Greenland's icy mountains,

   From India's coral strand,

   Where Afric's sunny fountains

   Roll down their golden sand;

   From many an ancient river,

   From many a palmy plain,

   They call us to deliver

   Their land from error's chain.


   What though the spicy breezes

   Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle;

   Though every prospect pleases,

   And only man is vile:

   In vain with lavish kindness

   The gifts of God are strown;

   The heathen in his blindness

   Bows down to wood and stone.


   Can we, whose souls are lighted

   With wisdom from on high;

   Can we to men benighted

   The lamp of life deny?

   Salvation, O salvation!

   The joyful sound proclaim,

   Till each remotest nation

   Has learnt Messiah's Name.


   Waft, waft, ye winds, his story,

   And you, ye waters, roll,

   Till, like a sea of glory,

   It spreads from pole to pole;

   Till o'er our ransomed nature,

   The Lamb for sinners slain,

   Redeemer, King, Creator,

   In bliss returns to reign.

   As year succeeds to year:

   God is working his purpose out,

   And the time is drawing near;

   Nearer and nearer draws the time,

   The time that shall surely be,

   When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God

   As the waters cover the sea.


   From utmost east to utmost west,

   Where'er man's foot hath trod,

   By the mouth of many messengers

   Goes forth the voice of God;

   Give ear to me, ye continents,

   Ye isles, give ear to me,

   That the earth may be filled with the glory of God

   As the waters cover the sea.


   What can we do to work God's work,

   To prosper and increase

   The brotherhood of all mankind,

   The reign of the Prince of Peace?

   What can we do to hasten the time,

   The time that shall surely be,

   When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God

   As the waters cover the sea.


   March we forth in the strength of God,

   With the banner of Christ unfurled,

   That the light of the glorious gospel of truth

   May shine throughout the world:

   Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin

   To set their captives free,

   That the earth may be filled with the glory of God

   As the waters cover the sea.


   All we can do is nothing worth,

   Unless God blesses the deed;

   Vainly we hope for the harvest-tide,

   Till God gives life to the seed;

   Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,

   The time that shall surely be,

   When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God

   As the waters cover the sea.


   Amen.

   That all the earth is now the Lord's.


   Let thrones and powers and kingdoms be

   Obedient, mighty God, to thee;

   And over land and stream and main

   Wave thou the scepter of thy reign.

   That not one rebel heart remains,

   But over all the Savior reigns!

   Icebound coasts give back the hymn.

   The hidden depths of many a heart.


   O give thine own sweet rest to me,

   That I may speak with soothing power

   A word in season, as from thee,

   To weary ones in needful hour.


   O fill me with thy fullness, Lord

   Until my very heart o'erflow

   In kindling thought and glowing word,

   Thy love to tell, thy praise to show.


   O use me, Lord, use even me

   Just as thou wilt, and when, and where;

   Until thy blessed face I see,

   Thy rest, thy joy, thy glory share.

   [1930]Hesperus:

   Henry Baker, 1866

   Emily Vernon Clark, 1891


   O God of mercy! hearken now:

   Before thy throne we humbly bow;

   With heart and voice to thee we cry

   For all on earth who suffering lie.


   We seek thee where thou dwell'st on high,

   Beyond the glittering, starry sky:

   We find thee where thou dwell'st below

   Beside the beds of want and woe.


   Be ours the hearts and hands to bless

   The sorrowing sons of wretchedness;

   Send thou the help we cannot give;

   Bid dying souls arise and live.


   O let the healing waters spring,

   Touched by thy pitying angel's wing;

   With quickening power new strength impart

   To palsied will, to withered heart.


   Where poverty in pain must lie,

   Where little suffering children cry,

   Bid us haste forth as called by thee,

   And in thy poor, thyself to see.


   Be thou, O God eternal, blest,

   Thy holy Name on earth confest!

   Echo thy praise from every shore

   For ever and for evermore.

   Holy offerings, rich and rare,

   Offerings of praise and prayer,

   Purer life and purpose high,

   Clasped hands, uplifted eye,

   Lowly acts of adoration

   To the God of our salvation;

   On his altar laid, we leave them.


   Christ, present them! God, receive them!


   Homage of each humble heart,

   Ere we from thy house depart;

   Worship fervent, deep and high,

   Adoration, ecstasy;

   All that childlike love can render

   Of devotion true and tender;

   On thine altar laid, we leave them:


   To the Father, and the Son,

   And the Spirit, Three in One,

   Though our mortal weakness raise

   Offerings of imperfect praise,

   Yet with hearts bowed down most lowly,

   Crying, Holy! Holy! Holy!

   On thine altar laid, we leave them:

   Help us ourselves to prove;

   O happy harbour of God's saints!

   O sweet and pleasant soil!

   In thee no sorrow can be found,

   Nor gloom, nor darksome night;

   But every soul shines as the sun;

   For God himself gives light.


   O my sweet home, Jerusalem,

   Thy joys when shall I see?

   The King that sitteth on thy throne

   In his felicity?


   Thy gardens and thy goodly walks

   Continually are green,

   Where grow such sweet and pleasant flowers

   As nowhere else are seen.


   Right through thy streets, with silver sound,

   The living waters flow,

   And on the banks, on either side,

   The trees of life do grow.


   Those trees for evermore bear fruit,

   And evermore do spring:

   There evermore the angels are

   And evermore do sing.

   What radiancy of glory!

   Death, like a narrow sea, divides

   Bright fields beyond the swelling flood

   Stand dressed in living green;

   So to the Jews fair Canaan stood,

   While Jordan rolled between.


   But timorous mortals start and shrink

   To cross the narrow sea;

   And linger, trembling on the brink,

   And fear to launch away.


   O could we make our doubts remove,

   Those gloomy doubts that rise,

   And see the Canaan that we love,

   With faith's illumined eyes:


   Could we but climb where Moses stood,

   And view the landscape o'er,

   Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,

   Should fright us from the shore.

   Fear not, brethren; joyful stand

   On the borders of your land;

   Jesus Christ, your Father's Son,

   Bids you undismayed go on.

518. Hark! the voice eternal

   6.5.,12 lines

   [2051]Vox Aeterna:

   Horatio Parker, 1903

   John Julian, 1882


   Hark! the voice eternal,

   Robed in majesty,

   Calling into being

   Earth and sea and sky;

   Hark! in countless numbers

   All the angel-throng

   Hail creation's morning

   With one burst of song.

   High in regal glory,

   'Mid eternal light,

   Reign, O King immortal,

   Holy, infinite.


   Bright the world and glorious,

   Calm both earth and sea,

   Noble in its grandeur

   Stood man's purity;

   Came the great transgression,

   Came the saddening fall,

   Death and desolation

   Breathing over all.

   Still in regal glory,

   'Mid eternal light,

   Reigned the King immortal,

   Holy, infinite.


   Long the nations waited,

   Through the troubled night,

   Looking, longing, yearning,

   For the promised light.

   Prophets saw the morning

   Breaking far away,

   Minstrels sang the splendour

   Of that opening day;

   Whilst in regal glory,

   'Mid eternal light,

   Reigned the King immortal,

   Holy, infinite.


   Brightly dawned the Advent

   Of the newborn King,

   Joyously the watchers

   Heard the angels sing.

   Sadly closed the evening

   Of his hallowed life,

   As the noontide darkness

   Veiled the last dread strife.

   Lo! again in glory,

   'Mid eternal light,

   Reigns the King immortal,

   Holy, infinite.


   Lo! again he cometh,

   Robed in clouds of fight,

   As the Judge eternal,

   Armed with power and might.

   Nations to his footstool

   Gathered then shall be;

   Earth shall yield her treasures,

   And her dead, the sea.

   Till the trumpet soundeth,

   'Mid eternal light,

   Reign, thou King immortal,

   Holy, infinite.


   Jesus! Lord and Master,

   Prophet, Priest, and King,

   To thy feet, triumphant,

   Hallowed praise we bring.

   Thine the pain and weeping,

   Thine the victory;

   Power, and praise, and honour,

   Be, O Lord, to thee.

   High in regal glory,

   'Mid eternal light,

   Reign, O King immortal,

   Holy, infinite.


   Amen.

   Ancient of Days, who sittest, throned in glory;

   To thee all knees are bent, all voices pray;

   Thy love has blessed the wide world's wondrous story,

   With light and life since Eden's dawning day.


   O Holy Father, who hast led thy children

   In all the ages, with the Fire and Cloud,

   Through seas dry-shod, through weary wastes bewildering,

   To thee, in reverent love, our hearts are bowed.


   O Holy Jesus, Prince of Peace and Savior,

   To thee we owe the peace that still prevails,

   Stilling the rude wills of men's wild behavior,

   And calming passion's fierce and stormy gales.


   O Holy Ghost, the Lord and the Life-giver,

   Thine is the quickening power that gives increase.

   From thee have flowed, as from a pleasant river,

   Our plenty, wealth, prosperity, and peace.


   O Triune God, with heart and voice adoring,

   Praise we the goodness that doth crown our days;

   Pray we that thou wilt hear us, still imploring

   Thy love and favour, kept to us always.


   Amen.

   Hearts and voices heavenward raise:

   Sing to God a hymn of gladness,

   Sing to God a hymn of praise:

   He, who on the cross a victim,

   For the world's salvation bled,

   Jesus Christ, the King of glory,

   Now is risen from the dead.


   Now the iron bars are broken,

   Christ from death to life is born,

   Glorious life, and life immortal,

   On this holy Easter morn:

   Christ has triumphed, and we conquer

   By his mighty enterprise,

   We with him to life eternal

   By his resurrection rise.


   Christ is risen, Christ, the first-fruits

   Of the holy harvest-field,

   Which will all its full abundance

   At his second coming yield:

   Then the golden ears of harvest

   Will their heads before him wave,

   Ripened by his glorious sunshine

   From the furrows of the grave.


   Christ is risen, we are risen!

   Shed upon us heavenly grace,

   Rain and dew and gleams of glory

   From the brightness of thy face:

   That, with hearts in heaven dwelling,

   We on earth may fruitful be,

   And by angel hands be gathered,

   And be ever, Lord, with thee.


   Alleluia! Alleluia!

   Glory be to God on high;

   Alleluia to the Savior

   Who has won the victory;

   Alleluia to the Spirit,

   Fount of love and sanctity;

   Alleluia! Alleluia!

   To the Triune Majesty.

   Christopher Wordsworth, 1862


   See the Conqueror mounts in triumph;

   See the King in royal state,

   Riding on the clouds, his chariot,

   To his heavenly palace gate!

   Hark! the choirs of angel voices

   Joyful alleluias sing,

   And the portals high are lifted

   To receive their heavenly King.


   Who is this that comes in glory,

   With the trump of jubilee?

   Lord of battles, God of armies,

   He hath gained the victory!

   He who on the cross did suffer,

   He who from the grave arose,

   He has vanquished sin and Satan;

   He by death has spoiled his foes.


   While he raised his hands in blessing,

   He was parted from his friends

   While their eager eyes behold him,

   He upon the clouds ascends;

   He who walked with God and pleased him,

   Preaching truth and doom to come,

   He, our Enoch, is translated

   To his everlasting home.


   Now our heavenly Aaron enters,

   With his blood, within the veil;

   Joshua now is come to Canaan,

   And the kings before him quail;

   Now he plants the tribes of Israel

   In their promised resting-place;

   Now our great Elijah offers

   Double portion of his grace.


   Thou hast raised our human nature

   On the clouds to God's right hand:

   There we sit in heavenly places,

   There with thee in glory stand.

   Jesus reigns, adored by angels;

   Man with God is on the throne;

   Mighty Lord, in thine Ascension,

   We by faith behold our own.

   On to victory,

   Jesus, King of glory,

   Throned above the sky,

   When the shadows lengthen,

   Show us, Lord, thy way;

   Through the darkness lead us

   To the heavenly day.

   When our course is finished,

   Ended all the strife,

   Grant us with the faithful

   Palms and crowns of life.

   Hear us, thou that broodedst

   O'er the wat'ry deep,

   Waking all creation

   From its primal sleep;

   Holy Spirit, breathing

   Breath of life divine,

   Breathe into our spirits,

   Blending them with thine.


   Light and Life immortal!

   Hear us as we raise

   Hearts, as well as voices,

   Mingling prayer and praise.


   When the sun ariseth

   In a cloudless sky,

   May we feel thy presence,

   Holy Spirit, nigh;

   Shed thy radiance o'er us,

   Keep it cloudless still,

   Through the day before us,

   Perfecting thy will.


   When the fight is fiercest

   In the noontide heat,

   Bear us, Holy Spirit,

   To our Savior's feet;

   There to find a refuge

   Till our work is done,

   There to fight the battle

   Till the battle's won.


   If the day be falling

   Sadly as it goes,

   Slowly in its sadness

   Sinking to its close,

   May thy love in mercy,

   Kindling, ere it die,

   Cast a ray of glory

   O'er our evening sky.


   Morning, noon, and evening,

   Whensoe'er it be,

   Grant us, gracious Spirit,

   Quickening life in thee:

   Life that gives us, living,

   Life of heavenly love,

   Life that brings us, dying,

   Life from heaven above.

PART I

   Verse 1 ends here; the other verses continue;

PART II

   (Sung to Dierdre)

   (Sung to St. Patrick)

   Irish; St. Patrick (372-466);

   Tr. Cecil Frances Alexander, 1885


   I Bind unto myself today

   The strong Name of the Trinity,

   By invocation of the same,

   The Three in One and One in Three.


   I bind this day to me for ever,

   By power of faith, Christ's Incarnation;

   His baptism in Jordan river;

   His death on cross for my salvation;

   His bursting from the spicèd tomb;

   His riding up the heavenly way;

   His coming at the day of doom:

   I bind unto myself today.


   I bind unto myself the power

   Of the great love of cherubim;

   The sweet 'Well done' in judgment hour;

   The service of the seraphim;

   Confessors' faith, apostles' word,

   The patriarchs' prayers, the prophets' scrolls;

   All good deeds done unto the Lord,

   And purity of virgin souls.


   I bind unto myself today

   The virtues of the star-lit heaven,

   The glorious sun's life-giving ray,

   The whiteness of the moon at even,

   The flashing of the lightning free,

   The whirling wind's tempestuous shocks,

   The stable earth, the deep salt sea,

   Around the old eternal rocks.


   I bind unto myself today

   The power of God to hold and lead,

   His eye to watch, his might to stay,

   His ear to hearken to my need;

   The wisdom of my God to teach,

   His hand to guide, his shield to ward;

   The word of God to give me speech,

   His heavenly host to be my guard.


   Christ be with me, Christ within me,

   Christ behind me, Christ before me,

   Christ beside me, Christ to win me,

   Christ to comfort and restore me,

   Christ beneath me, Christ above me,

   Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,

   Christ in hearts of all that love me,

   Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.


   I bind unto myself the Name,

   The strong Name of the Trinity;

   By invocation of the same,

   The Three in One, and One in Three.

   Of whom all nature hath creation;

   Eternal Father, Spirit, Word:

   Praise to the Lord of my salvation,

   Salvation is of Christ the Lord.

   Deep in adoration

   Bending low the knee:

   Thou for our redemption

   Cam'st on earth to die:

   Thou, that we might follow,

   Hast gone up on high.


   Great, and ever greater,

   Are thy mercies here;

   True and everlasting

   Are the glories there,

   Where no pain or sorrow,

   Toil or care, is known,

   Where the angel legions

   Circle round thy throne.


   Clearer still, and clearer,

   Dawns the light from heaven,

   In our sadness bringing

   News of sins forgiven;

   Life has lost its shadows;

   Pure the light within;

   Thou hast shed thy radiance

   On a world of sin.


   Brighter still, and brighter,

   Glows the western sun,

   Shedding all its gladness

   O'er our work that's done;

   Time will soon be over,

   Toil and sorrow past,

   May we, blessèd Savior,

   Find a rest at last!


   Onward, ever onward,

   Journeying o'er the road

   Worn by saints before us,

   Journeying on to God!

   Leaving all behind us,

   May we hasten on,

   Backward never looking

   Till the prize is won.


   Bliss, all bliss excelling,

   When the ransomed soul,

   Earthly toils forgetting,

   Finds its promised goal;

   Where in joys unheard of

   Saints with angels song,

   Never weary raising

   Praises to their King.

   At the Name of Jesus

   Every knee shall bow,

   King of glory now;

   Tis the Father's pleasure

   We should call him Lord,

   Who from the beginning

   Was the mighty Word.


   At his voice creation

   Sprang at once to sight,

   All the angel faces,

   All the hosts of light,

   Thrones and dominations,

   Stars upon their way,

   All the heavenly orders,

   In their great array.


   Humbled for a season,

   To receive a Name

   From the lips of sinners,

   Unto whom he came,

   Faithfully he bore it

   Spotless to the last,

   Brought it back victorious,

   When from death he passed;


   Bore it up triumphant,

   With its human light,

   Through all ranks of creatures,

   To the central height:

   To the throne of Godhead,

   To the Father's breast,

   Filled it with the glory

   Of that perfect rest.


   In your hearts enthrone him;

   There let him subdue

   All that is not holy,

   All that is not true:

   Crown him as your Captain

   In temptation's hour;

   Let his will enfold you

   In its light and power.


   Brothers, this Lord Jesus

   Shall return again,

   With his Father's glory,

   With his angel train;

   For all wreaths of empire

   Meet upon his brow,

   And our hearts confess him

   King of Glory now.

   Far o'er yon horizon

   Rise the city towers,

   Where our God abideth;

   That fair home is ours:

   O thou God of love!


   If with honest-hearted

   Love for God and man,

   Day by day thou find us

   Doing what we can,

   Thou who giv'st the seedtime

   Wilt give large increase,

   Crown the head with blessings,

   Fill the heart with peace.


   On our way rejoicing

   Gladly let us go;

   Conquered hath our Leader,

   Vanquished is our foe!

   Christ without, our safety;

   Christ within, our joy;

   Who, if we be faithful,

   Can our hope destroy?


   Unto God the Father

   Joyful songs we sing;

   Unto God the Savior

   Thankful hearts we bring;

   Unto God the Spirit

   Bow we and adore,

   On our way rejoicing

   Now and evermore!

   P.M.

   [2088]To Victory:

   Joseph Barnby, 1872

   (The refrain is sung before and after each verse.)

   Refrain

   Gerard Moultrie, 1867


   We march, we march to victory!

   With the cross of the Lord before us,

   With his loving eye looking down from the sky,

   And his holy arm spread o'er us.


   We come in the might of the Lord of light,

   In reverent train to meet him;

   And we put to flight the armies of night,

   That the sons of the day may greet him.


   Our sword is the Spirit of God on high,

   Our helmet is his salvation,

   Our banner, the cross of Calvary,

   Our watchword, the Incarnation.


   And the choir of angels with song awaits

   Our march to the golden Sion;

   For our Captain has broken the brazen gates,

   And burst the bars of iron.


   Then onward we march, our arms to prove,

   With the banner of Christ before us,

   With his eye of love looking down from above,

   And his holy arm spread o'er us.

   The day of march has come;

   Henceforth in fields of conquest

   Thy tents shall be our home:

   Through days of preparation

   Thy grace has made us strong,

   And now, O King Eternal,

   We lift our battle-song.


   Lead on, O King Eternal,

   Till sin's fierce war shall cease,

   And holiness shall whisper

   The sweet Amen of peace;

   For not with swords loud clashing,

   Nor roll of stirring drums,

   But deeds of love and mercy,

   The heavenly kingdom comes.


   Lead on, O King Eternal:

   We follow, not with fears;

   For gladness breaks like morning

   Where'er thy face appears;

   Thy cross is lifted o'er us;

   We journey in its light:

   The crown awaits the conquest;

   Lead on, O God of might.

   Gleams and burns the guiding light:

   Brother clasps the hand of brother,

   Stepping fearless through the night.


   One, the light of God's own presence,

   O'er his ransomed people shed,

   Chasing far the gloom and terror,

   Brightening all the path we tread:

   One, the object of our journey,

   One, the faith which never tires,

   One, the earnest looking forward,

   One, the hope our God inspires.


   One, the strain the lips of thousands

   Lift as from the heart of one;

   One the conflict, one the peril,

   One, the march in God begun:

   One, the gladness of rejoicing

   On the far eternal shore,

   Where the One Almighty Father

   Reigns in love for evermore.


   Onward therefore, pilgrim brothers,

   Onward, with the cross our aid!

   Bear its shame, and fight its battle,

   Till we rest beneath its shade!

   Soon shall come the great awaking;

   Soon the rending of the tomb;

   Then the scattering of all shadows,

   And the end of toil and gloom!

   All beside but loss.


   He who gladly barters

   All on earthly ground;

   He who, like the martyrs,

   Says, "I will be crowned";

   He whose one oblation

   Is a life of love,

   Knit in God's salvation.

   To the blest above.


   Shame upon you, legions

   Of the heavenly King,

   Citizens of regions

   Around the great white throne,

   With harpers harping on their harps

   To him that sat thereon:

   "Salvation, glory, honour!"

   I heard the song arise,

   As through the courts of heaven it rolled

   In wondrous harmonies.


   From every clime and kindred,

   And nations from afar,

   As serried ranks returning home

   In triumph from a war,

   I heard the saints upraising,

   The myriad hosts among,

   In praise of him who died and lives,

   Their one glad triumph song.


   I saw the holy city,

   The New Jerusalem,

   Come down from heaven, a bride adorned

   With jeweled diadem;

   The flood of crystal waters

   Flowed down the golden street;

   And nations brought their honours there,

   And laid them at her feet.


   And there no sun was needed,

   Nor moon to shine by night,

   God's glory did enlighten all,

   The Lamb himself the light;

   And there his servants serve him,

   And, life's long battle o'er,

   Enthroned with him, their Savior, King,

   They reign for evermore.


   O great and glorious vision!

   The Lamb upon his throne;

   O wondrous sight for man to see!

   The Savior with his own:

   To drink the living waters

   And stand upon the shore,

   Where neither sorrow, sin, nor death

   Shall ever enter more.


   O Lamb of God who reignest!

   Thou bright and morning Star,

   Whose glory lightens that new earth

   Which now we see from far!

   O worthy Judge eternal!

   When thou dost bid us come,

   Then open wide the gates of pearl

   And call thy servants home.

   Like silver lamps in a distant shrine,

   The stars are sparkling bright;

   For the Son of Mary is born tonight.

   The gloom is past,

   And the morn at last

   Is coming with orient light.


   No earthly songs are half so sweet

   As those which are filling the skies,

   And never a palace shone half so fair

   As the manger-bed where our Savior lies;

   No night in the year

   Is half so dear

   As this which has ended our sighs.


   The stars of heaven still shine as at first

   They gleamed on this wonderful night;

   The bells of the city of God peal out,

   And the angels' song still rings in the height,

   And love still turns

   Where the Godhead burns,

   Hid in flesh from fleshly sight.


   Faith sees no longer the stable floor,

   The pavement of sapphire is there,

   The clear light of heaven streams out to the world,

   And the angels of God are crowding the air,

   And heaven and earth,

   Through the spotless birth,

   Are at peace on this night so fair.

   [2144]Mauburn:

   T. Tertius Noble, 1918

   Latin, Jean Mauburn, 1494;

   Tr. Elizabeth Charles, 1858


   Dost thou in a manger lie,

   Who hast all created,

   Stretching infant hands on high,

   Savior, long awaited?

   If a monarch, where thy state?

   Where thy court on thee to wait?

   Royal purple, where?

   Here no regal pomp we see;

   Naught but need and penury:

   Why thus cradled here?


   Pitying love for fallen man

   Brought me down thus low;

   For a race deep lost in sin,

   Came I into woe.

   By this lowly birth of mine,

   Sinner, riches shall be thine,

   Matchless gifts and free;

   Willingly this yoke I take,

   And this sacrifice I make,

   Heaping joys for thee.


   Fervent praise would I to thee

   Evermore be raising;

   For thy wondrous love to me

   Thee be ever praising.

   Glory, glory be for ever

   Unto that most bounteous Giver,

   And that loving Lord!

   Better witness to thy worth,

   Purer praise than ours on earth,

   Angels' songs afford.


   Amen.

551. The first Nowell the angel did say

   P.M.

   [2146]The First Nowell:

   Traditional English;

   pub. 1833

   Refrain

   Traditional


   The first Nowell the angel did say

   Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;

   In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep,

   On a cold winter's night that was so deep.


   Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,

   Born is the King of Israel.


   They lookèd up and saw a star

   Shining in the east, beyond them far,

   And to the earth it gave great light,

   And so it continued both day and night.


   And by the light of that same star

   Three wise men came from country far;

   To seek for a king was their intent,

   And to follow the star wherever it went.


   This star drew nigh to the northwest,

   O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,

   And there it did both stop and stay

   Right over the place where Jesus lay.


   Then entered in those wise men three

   Full reverently upon their knee,

   And offered there in his presence

   Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.


   Then let us all with one accord

   Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;

   That hath made heaven and earth of naught,

   And with his blood mankind hath bought.

   Joy fills our inmost hearts today!

   The royal Child is born;

   And angel hosts in glad array

   His advent keep this morn.

   Rejoice, rejoice! the incarnate Word

   Has come on earth to dwell;

   No sweeter sound than this is heard,

   Emmanuel, Emmanuel.


   Low at the cradle throne we bend,

   We wonder and adore;

   And feel no bliss can ours transcend,

   No joy was sweet before.

   Rejoice, rejoice! the incarnate Word

   Has come on earth to dwell;

   No sweeter sound than this is heard,

   Emmanuel, Emmanuel.


   For us the world must lose its charms

   Before the manger shrine,

   When, folded in thy mother's arms,

   We see thee, Babe divine.

   Rejoice, rejoice! the incarnate Word

   Has come on earth to dwell;

   No sweeter sound than this is heard,

   Emmanuel, Emmanuel.


   Thou Light of uncreated Light,

   Shine on us, holy Child;

   That we may keep thy birthday bright,

   With service undefiled.

   Rejoice, rejoice! the incarnate Word

   Has come on earth to dwell;

   No sweeter sound than this is heard,

   Emmanuel, Emmanuel.

   [2150]The Wise Men:

   Berthold Tours, 1881

   Cecil Frances Alexander, 1853


   Saw you never, in the twilight,

   When the sun had left the skies,

   Up in heaven the clear stars shining

   Through the gloom, like silver eyes?

   So of old the wise men, watching,

   Saw a little stranger star,

   And they knew the King was given,

   And they followed it from far.


   Heard you never of the story

   How they crossed the desert wild,

   Journeyed on by plain and mountain

   Till they found the holy Child?

   How they opened all their treasure,

   Kneeling to that infant King;

   Gave the gold and fragrant incense,

   Gave the myrrh in offering?


   Know ye not that lowly baby

   Was the bright and morning Star?

   He who came to light the Gentiles,

   And the darkened isles afar?

   And we, too, may seek his cradle;

   There our hearts' best treasures bring;

   Love, and faith, and true devotion

   For our Savior, God, and King.

   John Henry Hopkins, Jr., 1867


   We three kings of Orient are,

   Bearing gifts we traverse afar,

   Field and fountain,

   Moor and mountain,

   Following yonder star.


   O star of wonder, star of night,

   Star with royal beauty bright;

   Westward leading,

   Still proceeding,

   Guide us to thy perfect light.


   Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,

   Gold I bring to crown him again,

   King for ever,

   Ceasing never

   Over us all to reign.


   Frankincense to offer have I,

   Incense owns a Deity nigh,

   Prayer and praising,

   All men raising,

   Worship him, God on high.


   Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume

   Breathes a life of gathering gloom;

   Sorrowing, sighing,

   Bleeding, dying,

   Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.


   Glorious now behold him arise,

   King, and God, and Sacrifice,

   Heav'n sings Alle-

   luia: Alle-

   luia the earth replies.

   O sons and daughters, let us sing!

   The King of heaven, the glorious King,

   O'er death today rose triumphing.


   That Easter morn, at break of day,

   The faithful women went their way

   To seek the tomb where Jesus lay.


   An angel clad in white they see,

   Who sat, and spake unto the three,

   "Your Lord doth go to Galilee."


   That night the apostles met in fear;

   Amidst them came their Lord most dear,

   And said, "My peace be on all here."


   When Thomas first the tidings heard,

   How they had seen the risen Lord,

   He doubted the disciples' word.


   "My pierced hands, O Thomas, see;

   My hands, my feet, I show to thee;

   Not faithless, but believing be."


   No longer Thomas then denied,

   He saw the feet, the hands, the side;

   "Thou art my Lord and God," he cried.


   How blest are they who have not seen,

   And yet whose faith has constant been,

   For they eternal life shall win.


   On this most holy day of days,

   To God your hearts and voices raise,

   In laud, and jubilee, and praise.

   God hath sent his angels to the earth again,

   Bringing joyful tidings to the sons of men;

   They who first, at Christmas, thronged the heavenly way,

   Now beside the tomb-door, sit on Easter Day.


   Angels sing his triumph, as you sang his birth,

   "Christ, the Lord, is risen. Peace, goodwill on earth."


   In the dreadful desert, where the Lord was tried,

   There the faithful angels gathered at his side;

   And when in the garden, grief and pain and care

   Bowed him down with anguish, they were with him there.


   Yet the Christ they honor is the same Christ still,

   Who, in light and darkness, did his Father's will;

   And the tomb deserted shineth like the sky,

   Since he passed out from it into victory.


   God has still His angels, helping, at his word,

   All his faithful children, like their faithful Lord;

   Soothing them in sorrow, arming them in strife,

   Opening wide the tomb-doors, leading into life.

   Made the glorious marvel known.

   On thy waiting Church be poured!

   Once thou on thy Church didst shower

   Mighty signs and words of power;


   Humbler things we ask thee now,

   Gifts of heaven to men below;

   Grant our burdened heart release,

   Grant thine own abiding peace.

   He leadeth me! O blessed thought, [3762]t2.t225.h245-p0.6

   He who would valiant be, [3763]t2.t29.h117-p0.6

   Heal me, O my Savior, heal, [3764]t2.t210.h137-p0.6

   Hear us, thou that broodedst, [3765]t6.t61.h524-p0.6

   Here, O my Lord, I see thee face to face, [3766]t3.t33.h334-p0.6

   His are the thousand sparkling rills, [3767]t2.t212.h156-p0.6

   Holy Father, cheer our way, [3768]t1.t13.h16-p0.6

   Holy Father, great Creator, [3769]t2.t221.h210-p0.6

   Holy Spirit, Lord of love, [3770]t3.t39.h371-p0.6

   Holy Spirit, Truth divine, [3771]t3.t39.h373-p0.6

   Holy offerings, rich and rare, [3772]t5.t54.h504-p0.6

   Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty, [3773]t2.t221.h205-p0.6

   Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord, [3774]t2.t221.h208-p0.6

   Hosanna to the living Lord, [3775]t2.t21.h53-p0.6

   How beauteous were the marks divine, [3776]t2.t28.h108-p0.6

   How bright appears the Morning Star, [3777]t2.t28.h98-p0.6

   How bright these glorious spirits shine, [3778]t2.t246.h302-p0.6

   How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, [3779]t2.t222.h212-p0.6

   How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds, [3780]t2.t223.h232-p0.6

   How wondrous and great, [3781]t2.t226.h254-p0.6

   Hushed was the evening hymn, [3782]t3.t36.h359-p0.6

   I Bind unto myself today, [3783]t6.t61.h525-p0.6

   I am not worthy, holy Lord, [3784]t3.t33.h323-p0.6

   I could not do without Thee, [3785]t2.t224.h239-p0.6

   I do not ask, O Lord, that life may be, [3786]t3.t311.h385-p0.6

   I heard a sound of voices, [3787]t6.t61.h542-p0.6

   I heard the voice of Jesus say, [3788]t2.t224.h242-p0.6

   I hunger and I thirst, [3789]t3.t33.h325-p0.6

   I look to thee in every need, [3790]t3.t311.h397-p0.6

   I love thy kingdom, Lord, [3791]t3.t31.h315-p0.6

   I sought the Lord, and afterward I knew, [3792]t3.t311.h398-p0.6

   I think when I read that sweet story of old, [3793]t3.t36.h350-p0.6

   Immortal Love, for ever full, [3794]t3.t311.h404-p0.6

   In heavenly love abiding, [3795]t2.t222.h224-p0.6

   In his own raiment clad, [3796]t2.t213.h163-p1.6

   In his temple now behold him, [3797]t2.t231.h273-p0.6

   In the cross of Christ I glory, [3798]t2.t212.h152-p0.6

   In the hour of trial, [3799]t2.t212.h147-p0.6

   In token that thou shalt not fear, [3800]t3.t34.h344-p0.6

   Inspirer and hearer of prayer, [3801]t1.t14.h34-p0.6

   It came upon the midnight clear, [3802]t2.t22.h71-p1.4,
   [3803]t2.t22.h79-p0.6

   Jerusalem the golden, [3804]t5.t56.h511-p0.6

   Jerusalem! high tower thy glorious walls, [3805]t6.t61.h543-p0.6

   Jerusalem, my happy home, [3806]t5.t56.h514-p0.6

   Jesus, crowned with all renown, [3820]t2.t217.h181-p0.6

   Jesus, from thy throne on high, [3821]t3.t38.h368-p0.6

   Jesus, gentlest Savior, [3822]t3.t33.h322-p0.6

   Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all, [3824]t2.t223.h228-p0.6

   Jesus, my Savior, look on me, [3825]t3.t311.h390-p0.6

   Jesus, my strength, my hope, [3826]t2.t222.h215-p0.6

   Jesus, still lead on, [3827]t4.t43.h449-p0.6

   Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me, [3828]t3.t36.h360-p0.6

   Jesus, the very thought of thee, [3829]t3.t31.h316-p0.6

   Jesus, thou Joy of loving hearts, [3830]t3.t33.h328-p0.6

   Jesus, thy boundless love to me, [3831]t2.t223.h229-p0.6

   Jesus, to thy table led, [3832]t3.t33.h327-p0.6

   Jesus, with thy Church abide, [3833]t5.t52.h473-p0.6

   Joy because the circling year, [3834]t7.t71.h561-p0.6

   Joy dawned again on Easter-Day, [3835]t7.t71.h556-p0.6

   Joy fills our inmost hearts today, [3836]t7.t71.h552-p0.6

   Joy to the world! the Lord is come, [3837]t2.t28.h101-p0.6

   Judge eternal, throned in splendour, [3838]t4.t42.h432-p0.6

   Just as I am, without one plea, [3839]t2.t210.h139-p0.6

   King of saints, to whom the number, [3840]t2.t241.h287-p0.6

   Lamp of our feet, whereby we trace, [3841]t2.t21.h60-p0.6

   Lead on, O King Eternal, [3842]t6.t61.h534-p0.6

   Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom, [3845]t2.t225.h244-p0.6

   Let all mortal flesh keep silence, [3846]t3.t33.h339-p0.6

   Let saints on earth in concert sing, [3847]t2.t246.h299-p0.6

   Let the song go round the earth, [3848]t5.t53.h485-p0.6

   Let thy Blood in mercy poured, [3849]t3.t33.h340-p0.6

   Light's abode, celestial Salem, [3852]t5.t56.h507-p0.6

   Like silver lamps in a distant shrine, [3853]t7.t71.h548-p0.6

   Lo! what a cloud of witnesses, [3854]t2.t246.h300-p0.6

   Not by thy mighty hand, [3904]t2.t28.h109-p0.6

   Now from the altar of my heart, [3905]t1.t13.h27-p0.6

   Rejoice, rejoice, believers, [3998]t2.t21.h61-p0.6

   Rejoice, the Lord is King, [3999]t6.t61.h521-p0.6

   Rejoice, ye pure in heart, [4000]t6.t61.h537-p0.6

   Resting from his work today, [4001]t2.t215.h165-p0.6

   Revive thy work, O Lord, [4002]t4.t44.h452-p0.6

   Ride on! ride on in majesty, [4003]t2.t212.h145-p0.6

   Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, [4004]t4.t43.h444-p0.6

   Rise up, O men of God, [4005]t5.t54.h492-p0.6

   Rise, crowned with light, imperial Salem, rise, [4006]t5.t51.h466-p0.6

   Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings, [4007]t2.t29.h114-p0.6

   Rock of ages, cleft for me, [4008]t2.t222.h217-p0.6

   Round the Lord in glory seated, [4009]t2.t221.h207-p0.6

   Safe upon the billowy deep, [4010]t3.t314.h417-p0.6

   Safely through another week, [4011]t1.t15.h46-p0.6

   Savior! when in dust to thee, [4012]t2.t210.h130-p0.6

   Savior, again to thy dear Name we raise, [4013]t1.t15.h50-p0.6

   Savior, blessed Savior, [4014]t6.t61.h527-p0.6

   Savior, breathe an evening blessing, [4015]t1.t13.h24-p0.6

   Savior, like a shepherd lead us, [4016]t3.t36.h355-p0.6

   Savior, source of every blessing, [4017]t2.t224.h243-p0.6

   Savior, sprinkle many nations, [4018]t5.t53.h478-p0.6

   Savior, teach me, day by day, [4019]t3.t36.h354-p0.6

   Savior, when night involves the skies, [4020]t1.t14.h39-p0.6

   Savior, who thy flock art feeding, [4021]t3.t34.h343-p0.6

   Saw you never, in the twilight, [4022]t7.t71.h553-p0.6

   See the Conqueror mounts in triumph, [4023]t6.t61.h522-p0.6

   See the destined day arise, [4024]t2.t212.h146-p0.6

   Shepherd of souls, refresh and bless, [4025]t3.t33.h324-p0.6

   Shout the glad tidings, exultingly sing, [4026]t2.t22.h75-p0.6

   Silent night, holy night, [4027]t7.t71.h546-p0.6

   Sinful, sighing to be blest, [4028]t2.t210.h140-p0.6

   Sing Alleluia forth in duteous praise, [4029]t2.t226.h265-p0.6

   Sing, O sing, this blessed morn, [4030]t2.t22.h77-p0.6

   Sing, my soul, his wondrous love, [4031]t2.t226.h257-p0.6

   Softly now the light of day, [4032]t1.t13.h19-p0.6

   Soldiers of Christ, arise, [4033]t3.t35.h346-p0.6

   Soldiers of the cross, arise, [4034]t2.t29.h115-p0.6

   Songs of praise the angels sang, [4035]t2.t226.h256-p0.6

   Songs of thankfulness and praise, [4036]t2.t27.h96-p0.6

   Soon may the last glad song arise, [4037]t5.t53.h484-p0.6

   Spirit blest, who art adored, [4038]t2.t220.h204-p0.6

   Spirit divine, attend our prayers, [4039]t2.t219.h202-p0.6

   Spirit of mercy, truth, and love, [4040]t2.t219.h197-p0.6

   Stand up, stand up, for Jesus, [4041]t6.t61.h538-p0.6

   Stars of the morning, so gloriously bright, [4042]t2.t243.h289-p0.6

   Sun of my soul, thou Savior dear, [4043]t1.t13.h20-p0.6

   Sunset and evening star, [4044]t3.t312.h412-p0.6

   Sweet is the work, my God, my King, [4045]t1.t15.h44-p0.6

   Sweet the moments, rich in blessing, [4046]t2.t212.h157-p0.6

   Tarry with me, O my Savior, [4047]t1.t13.h31-p0.6

   Teach us what thy love has borne, [4048]t2.t211.h142c-p0.6

   Ten thousand times ten thousand, [4049]t6.t61.h541-p0.6

   Tender Shepherd, thou hast stilled, [4050]t3.t313.h414-p0.6

   The Church's one foundation, [4051]t5.t51.h464-p0.6

   The God of Abraham praise, [4052]t2.t226.h253-p0.6

   The King of love my Shepherd is, [4053]t3.t33.h326-p0.6

   The King shall come when morning dawns, [4054]t2.t21.h70-p0.6

   The Lord my pasture shall prepare, [4055]t3.t31.h317-p0.6

   The Son of God goes forth to war, [4056]t2.t23.h85-p0.6

   The ancient law departs, [4057]t2.t26.h88-p0.6

   The cross is on our brow, [4058]t3.t39.h369-p0.6

   The day is gently sinking to a close, [4059]t1.t13.h13-p0.6

   The day is past and gone, [4060]t1.t13.h21-p0.6

   The day is past and over, [4061]t1.t13.h23-p0.6

   The day of resurrection, [4062]t2.t216.h171-p0.6

   The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended, [4063]t1.t13.h29-p0.6

   The first Nowell the angel did say, [4064]t7.t71.h551-p0.6

   The grave itself a garden is, [4065]t2.t215.h166-p0.6

   The head, that once was crowned with thorns, [4066]t2.t218.h188-p0.6

   The morning light is breaking, [4067]t5.t53.h479-p0.6

   The radiant morn hath passed away, [4068]t1.t13.h14-p0.6

   The royal banners forward go, [4069]t2.t212.h144-p0.6

   The saints of God! their conflict past, [4070]t2.t246.h294-p0.6

   The shadows of the evening hours, [4071]t1.t13.h22-p0.6

   The son of Consolation!, [4072]t2.t236.h281-p0.6

   The spacious firmament on high, [4073]t2.t226.h252-p0.6

   The strife is o'er, the battle done, [4074]t2.t216.h173-p0.6

   The sun is sinking fast, [4075]t1.t13.h17-p0.6

   The voice that breathed o'er Eden, [4076]t3.t310.h383-p0.6

   The world is very evil, [4077]t2.t21.h68-p0.6

   There is a blessed home, [4078]t5.t56.h515-p0.6

   There is a green hill far away, [4079]t2.t212.h159-p0.6

   There is a land of pure delight, [4080]t5.t56.h513-p0.6

   There's a Friend for little children, [4081]t3.t36.h363-p0.6

   There's a wideness in God's mercy, [4082]t2.t224.h240-p0.6

   Thine for ever! God of love, [4083]t3.t39.h370-p0.6

   This is the day of light, [4084]t1.t15.h45-p0.6

   Those eternal bowers, [4085]t6.t61.h540-p0.6

   Thou art coming, O my Savior, [4086]t2.t21.h67-p0.6

   Thou art gone up on high, [4087]t2.t218.h189-p0.6

   Thou art my hiding-place, O Lord, [4088]t3.t311.h403-p0.6

   Thou art the Way, to thee alone, [4089]t2.t235.h279-p0.6

   Thou didst leave thy throne and thy kingly crown, [4090]t2.t22.h83-p0.6

   Thou hidden love of God, whose height, [4091]t2.t223.h227-p0.6

   Thou knowest, Lord, the weariness and sorrow, [4092]t3.t311.h402-p0.6

   Thou say'st, Take up thy cross, [4093]t2.t225.h246-p0.6

   Thou, who at thy first Eucharist didst pray, [4094]t3.t33.h337-p0.6

   Thou, whose almighty word, [4095]t2.t28.h104-p0.6

   Three in One, and One in Three, [4096]t1.t14.h38-p0.6

   Through Him, who all our sickness felt, [4097]t5.t54.h505-p0.6

   Through the day thy love has spared us, [4098]t1.t13.h15-p0.6

   Through the night of doubt and sorrow, [4099]t6.t61.h539-p0.6

   Thy kingdom come! on bended knee, [4100]t2.t21.h56-p0.6

   Thy kingdom come, O God, [4101]t2.t28.h105-p0.6

   Thy life was given for me, [4102]t2.t224.h238-p0.6

   Thy way, not mine, O Lord, [4103]t3.t311.h394-p0.6

   To the Name of our salvation, [4104]t2.t26.h89-p0.6

   To thee our God we fly, [4105]t2.t217.h182-p0.6

   Triumphant Sion, lift thy head, [4106]t5.t51.h472-p0.6

   Wake, awake, for night is flying, [4107]t2.t21.h62-p0.6

   Watchman, tell us of the night, [4108]t2.t28.h106-p0.6

   We build our school on thee, O Lord, [4109]t3.t37.h366-p0.6

   We come unto our fathers' God, [4110]t4.t41.h424-p0.6

   We give thee but thine own, [4111]t3.t32.h319-p0.6

   We love the place, O God, [4112]t5.t51.h465-p0.6

   We march, we march to victory, [4113]t6.t61.h533-p0.6

   We plow the fields, and scatter, [4114]t4.t41.h423-p0.6

   We praise thy Name, O Lord most High, [4115]t2.t239.h284-p0.6

   We praise thy grace, O Saviour, [4116]t2.t234.h278-p0.6

   We sing the glorious conquest, [4117]t2.t230.h271-p0.6

   We sing the praise of him who died, [4118]t2.t212.h160-p0.6

   We three kings of Orient are, [4119]t7.t71.h554-p0.6

   We walk by faith, and not by sight, [4120]t2.t229.h270-p0.6

   We would see Jesus; for the shadows lengthen, [4121]t3.t311.h406-p0.6

   Weary of self, and laden with my sin, [4122]t2.t210.h129-p0.6

   Weary of wandering from my God, [4123]t2.t210.h136-p0.6

   Welcome, happy morning! age to age shall say, [4124]t2.t216.h169-p0.6

   What thanks and praise to thee we owe, [4125]t2.t244.h292-p0.6

   When Christ was born of Mary free, [4126]t7.t71.h547-p0.6

   When I survey the wondrous cross, [4127]t2.t212.h154-p0.6

   When Jesus left his Father's throne, [4128]t3.t36.h362-p0.6

   When all thy mercies, O my God, [4129]t2.t224.h237-p0.6

   When morning gilds the skies, [4130]t1.t14.h37-p0.6

   When our heads are bowed with woe, [4131]t3.t312.h409-p0.6

   When wilt thou save the people?, [4132]t5.t54.h501-p0.6

   When wounded sore the stricken soul, [4133]t2.t210.h138-p0.6

   Where cross the crowded ways of life, [4134]t5.t54.h494-p0.6

   While shepherds watched their flocks by night, [4135]t2.t22.h71-p0.6

   While thee I seek, protecting Power, [4136]t1.t14.h35-p0.6

   Who are these in bright array, [4137]t2.t246.h298-p0.6

   Who are these like stars appearing, [4138]t2.t246.h296-p0.6

   With broken heart and contrite sigh, [4139]t2.t210.h133-p0.6

   With the sweet word of peace, [4140]t3.t314.h419-p0.6

   Ye Christian heralds, go, proclaim, [4141]t4.t44.h453-p0.6

   Ye holy angels bright, [4142]t2.t226.h264-p0.6

   Ye servants of the Lord, [4143]t4.t44.h456-p0.6

   Ye watchers and ye holy ones, [4144]t2.t226.h266-p0.6
