DEATH'S DUEL

   PSALM LXVIII. 20, in fine.

   And unto God the Lord belong the issues of death (i.e. from death).

   BUILDINGS stand by the benefit of their foundations that sustain and
   support them, and of their buttresses that comprehend and embrace them,
   and of their contignations that knit and unite them. The foundations
   suffer them not to sink, the buttresses suffer them not to swerve, and
   the contignation and knitting suffers them not to cleave. The body of
   our building is in the former part of this verse. It is this: He that
   is our God is the God of salvation; ad salutes, of salvations in the
   plural, so it is in the original; the God that gives us spiritual and
   temporal salvation too. But of this building, the foundation, the
   buttresses, the contignations, are in this part of the verse which
   constitutes our text, and in the three divers acceptations of the words
   amongst our expositors: Unto God the Lord belong the issues from death,
   for, first, the foundation of this building (that our God is the God of
   all salvation) is laid in this, that unto this God the Lord belong the
   issues of death; that is, it is in his power to give us an issue and
   deliverance, even then when we are brought to the jaws and teeth of
   death, and to the lips of that whirlpool, the grave. And so in this
   acceptation, this exitus mortis, this issue of death is liberatio á
   morte, a deliverance from death, and this is the most obvious and most
   ordinary acceptation of these words, and that upon which our
   translation lays hold, the issues from death. And then, secondly, the
   buttresses that comprehend and settle this building, that he that is
   our God is the God of all salvation, are thus raised; unto God the Lord
   belong the issues of death, that is, the disposition and manner of our
   death; what kind of issue and transmigration we shall have out of this
   world, whether prepared or sudden, whether violent or natural, whether
   in our perfect senses or shaken and disordered by sickness, there is no
   condemnation to be argued out of that, no judgment to be made upon
   that, for, howsoever they die, precious in his sight is the death of
   his saints, and with him are the issues of death; the ways of our
   departing out of this life are in his hands. And so in this sense of
   the words, this exitus mortis, the issues of death, is liberatio in
   morte, a deliverance in death; not that God will deliver us from dying,
   but that he will have a care of us in the hour of death, of what kind
   soever our passage be. And in this sense and acceptation of the words,
   the natural frame and contexture doth well and pregnantly administer
   unto us. And then, lastly, the contignation and knitting of this
   building, that he that is our God is the God of all salvations,
   consists in this, Unto this God the Lord belong the issues of death;
   that is, that this God the Lord having united and knit both natures in
   one, and being God, having also come into this world in our flesh, he
   could have no other means to save us, he could have no other issue out
   of this world, nor return to his former glory, but by death. And so in
   this sense, this exitus mortis, this issue of death, is liberatio per
   mortem, a deliverance by death, by the death of this God, our Lord
   Christ Jesus. And this is Saint Augustine's acceptation of the words,
   and those many and great persons that have adhered to him. In all these
   three lines, then, we shall look upon these words, first, as the God of
   power, the Almighty Father rescues his servants from the jaws of death;
   and then as the God of mercy, the glorious Son rescued us by taking
   upon himself this issue of death; and then, between these two, as the
   God of comfort, the Holy Ghost rescues us from all discomfort by his
   blessed impressions beforehand, that what manner of death soever be
   ordained for us, yet this exitus mortis shall be introitus in vitam,
   our issue in death shall be an entrance into everlasting life. And
   these three considerations: our deliverance à morte, in morte, per
   mortem, from death, in death, and by death, will abundantly do all the
   offices of the foundations, of the buttresses, of the contignation, of
   this our building; that he that is our God is the God of all salvation,
   because unto this God the Lord belong the issues of death.

   First, then, we consider this exitus mortis to be liberatio à morte,
   that with God the Lord are the issues of death; and therefore in all
   our death, and deadly calamities of this life, we may justly hope of a
   good issue from him. In all our periods and transitions in this life,
   are so many passages from death to death; our very birth and entrance
   into this life is exitus à morte, an issue from death, for in our
   mother's womb we are dead, so as that we do not know we live, not so
   much as we do in our sleep, neither is there any grave so close or so
   putrid a prison, as the womb would be unto us if we stayed in it beyond
   our time, or died there before our time. In the grave the worms do not
   kill us; we breed, and feed, and then kill those worms which we
   ourselves produced. In the womb the dead child kills the mother that
   conceived it, and is a murderer, nay, a parricide, even after it is
   dead. And if we be not dead so in the womb, so as that being dead we
   kill her that gave us our first life, our life of vegetation, yet we
   are dead so as David's idols are dead. In the womb we have eyes and see
   not, ears and hear not. There in the womb we are fitted for works of
   darkness, all the while deprived of light; and there in the womb we are
   taught cruelty, by being fed with blood, and may be damned, though we
   be never born. Of our very making in the womb, David says, I am
   wonderfully and fearfully made, and such knowledge is too excellent for
   me, [1] for even that is the Lord's doing, and it is wonderful in our
   eyes; [2] ipse fecit nos, it is he that made us, and not we ourselves,
   [3] nor our parents neither. Thy hands have made and fashioned me round
   about, saith Job, and (as the original word is) thou hast taken pains
   about me, and yet (says he) thou dost destroy me. Though I be the
   masterpiece of the greatest master (man is so), yet if thou do no more
   for me, if thou leave me where thou madest me, destruction will follow.
   The womb, which should be the house of life, becomes death itself if
   God leave us there. That which God threatens so often, the shutting of
   a womb, is not so heavy nor so discomfortable a curse in the first as
   in the latter shutting, nor in the shutting of barrenness as in the
   shutting of weakness, when children are come to the birth, and no
   strength to bring forth. [4]

   It is the exaltation of misery to fall from a near hope of happiness.
   And in that vehement imprecation, the prophet expresses the highest of
   God's anger, Give them, O Lord, what wilt thou give them? give them a
   miscarrying womb. Therefore as soon as we are men (that is, inanimated,
   quickened in the womb), though we cannot ourselves, our parents have to
   say in our behalf, Wretched man that he is, who shall deliver him from
   this body of death? [5] if there be no deliverer. It must be he that
   said to Jeremiah, Before I formed thee I knew thee, and before thou
   camest out of the womb I sanctified thee. We are not sure that there
   was no kind of ship nor boat to fish in, nor to pass by, till God
   prescribed Noah that absolute form of the ark. [6] That word which the
   Holy Ghost, by Moses, useth for the ark, is common to all kind of
   boats, thebah; and is the same word that Moses useth for the boat that
   he was exposed in, that his mother laid him in an ark of bulrushes. But
   we are sure that Eve had no midwife when she was delivered of Cain,
   therefore she might well say, Possedi virum à Domino, I have gotten a
   man from the Lord, [7] wholly, entirely from the Lord; it is the Lord
   that enabled me to conceive, the Lord that infused a quickening soul
   into that conception, the Lord that brought into the world that which
   himself had quickened; without all this might Eve say, my body had been
   but the house of death, and Domini Domini sunt exitus mortis, To God
   the Lord belong the issues of death. But then this exitus à morte is
   but introitus in mortem; this issue, this deliverance, from that death,
   the death of the womb, is an entrance, a delivering over to another
   death, the manifold deaths of this world; we have a winding-sheet in
   our mother's womb which grows with us from our conception, and we come
   into the world wound up in that winding-sheet, for we come to seek a
   grave. And as prisoners discharged of actions may lie for fees, so when
   the womb hath discharged us, yet we are bound to it by cords of hestae,
   by such a string as that we cannot go thence, nor stay there; we
   celebrate our own funerals with cries even at our birth; as though our
   threescore and ten years' life were spent in our mother's labour, and
   our circle made up in the first point thereof; we beg our baptism with
   another sacrament, with tears; and we come into a world that lasts many
   ages, but we last not. In domo Patris, says our Saviour, speaking of
   heaven, multae mansiones, divers and durable; so that if a man cannot
   possess a martyr's house (he hath shed no blood for Christ), yet he may
   have a confessor's, he hath been ready to glorify God in the shedding
   of his blood. And if a woman cannot possess a virgin's house (she hath
   embraced the holy state of marriage), yet she may have a matron's
   house, she hath brought forth and brought up children in the fear of
   God. In domo Patris, in my Father's house, in heaven, there are many
   mansions; [8] but here, upon earth, the Son of man hath not where to
   lay his head, [9] saith he himself. Nonne terram dedit filiis hominum?
   How then hath God given this earth to the sons of men? He hath given
   them earth for their materials to be made of earth, and he hath given
   them earth for their grave and sepulchre, to return and resolve to
   earth, but not for their possession. Here we have no continuing city,
   [10] nay, no cottage that continues, nay, no persons, no bodies, that
   continue. Whatsoever moved Saint Jerome to call the journeys of the
   Israelites in the wilderness, [11] mansions; the word (the word is
   nasang) signifies but a journey, but a peregrination. Even the Israel
   of God hath no mansions, but journeys, pilgrimages in this life. By
   what measure did Jacob measure his life to Pharaoh? The days of the
   years of my pilgrimage. [12] And though the apostle would not say
   morimur, that whilst we are in the body we are dead, yet he says,
   perigrinamur, whilst we are in the body we are but in a pilgrimage, and
   we are absent from the Lord: [13] he might have said dead, for this
   whole world is but an universal churchyard, but our common grave, and
   the life and motion that the greatest persons have in it is but as the
   shaking of buried bodies in their grave, by an earthquake. That which
   we call life is but hebdomada mortium, a week of death, seven days,
   seven periods of our life spent in dying, a dying seven times over; and
   there is an end. Our birth dies in infancy, and our infancy dies in
   youth, and youth and the rest die in age, and age also dies and
   determines all. Nor do all these, youth out of infancy, or age out of
   youth, arise so, as the phoenix out of the ashes of another phoenix
   formerly dead, but as a wasp or a serpent out of a carrion, or as a
   snake out of dung. Our youth is worse than our infancy, and our age
   worse than our youth. Our youth is hungry and thirsty after those sins
   which our infancy knew not; and our age is sorry and angry, that it
   cannot pursue those sins which our youth did; and besides, all the way,
   so many deaths, that is, so many deadly calamities accompany every
   condition and every period of this life, as that death itself would be
   an ease to them that suffer them. Upon this sense doth Job wish that
   God had not given him an issue from the first death, from the womb,
   Wherefore thou hast brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had
   given up the ghost, and no eye seen me! I should have been as though I
   had not been. [14] And not only the impatient Israelites in their
   murmuring (would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land
   of Egypt), [15] but Elijah himself, when he fled from Jezebel, and went
   for his life, as that text says, under the juniper tree, requested that
   he might die, and said, It is enough now, O Lord, take away my life.
   [16] So Jonah justifies his impatience, nay, his anger, towards God
   himself: Now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me, for it is
   better to die than to live. [17] And when God asked him, Dost thou well
   to be angry for this? he replies, I do well to be angry, even unto
   death. How much worse a death than death is this life, which so good
   men would so often change for death! But if my case be as Saint Paul's
   case, quotidiè morior, that I die daily, that something heavier than
   death fall upon me every day; if my case be David's case, tota die
   mortificamur; all the day long we are killed, that not only every day,
   but every hour of the day, something heavier than death fall upon me;
   though that be true of me, Conceptus in peccatis, I was shapen in
   iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me (there I died one
   death); though that be true of me, Natus filius irae, I was born not
   only the child of sin, but the child of wrath, of the wrath of God for
   sin, which is a heavier death: yet Domini Domini sunt exitus mortis,
   with God the Lord are the issues of death; and after a Job, and a
   Joseph, and a Jeremiah, and a Daniel, I cannot doubt of a deliverance.
   And if no other deliverance conduce more to his glory and my good, yet
   he hath the keys of death, [18] and he can let me out at that door,
   that is, deliver me from the manifold deaths of this world, the omni
   die, and the tota die, the every day's death and every hour's death, by
   that one death, the final dissolution of body and soul, the end of all.
   But then is that the end of all? Is that dissolution of body and soul
   the last death that the body shall suffer (for of spiritual death we
   speak not now). It is not, though this be exitus à morte: it is
   introitus in mortem; though it be an issue from manifold deaths of this
   world, yet it is an entrance into the death of corruption and
   putrefaction, and vermiculation, and incineration, and dispersion in
   and from the grave, in which every dead man dies over again. It was a
   prerogative peculiar to Christ, not to die this death, not to see
   corruption. What gave him this privilege? Not Joseph's great proportion
   of gums and spices, that might have preserved his body from corruption
   and incineration longer than he needed it, longer than three days, but
   it would not have done it for ever. What preserved him then? Did his
   exemption and freedom from original sin preserve him from this
   corruption and incineration? It is true that original sin hath induced
   this corruption and incineration upon us; if we had not sinned in Adam,
   mortality had not put on immortality [19] (as the apostle speaks), nor
   corruption had not put on incorruption, but we had had our
   transmigration from this to the other world without any mortality, any
   corruption at all. But yet since Christ took sin upon him, so far as
   made him mortal, he had it so far too as might have made him see this
   corruption and incineration, though he had no original sin in himself;
   what preserved him then? Did the hypostatical union of both natures,
   God and man, preserve him from this corruption and incineration? It is
   true that this was a most powerful embalming, to be embalmed with the
   Divine Nature itself, to be embalmed with eternity, was able to
   preserve him from corruption and incineration for ever. And he was
   embalmed so, embalmed with the Divine Nature itself, even in his body
   as well as in his soul; for the Godhead, the Divine Nature, did not
   depart, but remained still united to his dead body in the grave; but
   yet for all this powerful embalming, his hypostatical union of both
   natures, we see Christ did die; and for all his union which made him
   God and man, he became no man (for the union of the body and soul makes
   the man, and he whose soul and body are separated by death as long as
   that state lasts, is properly no man). And therefore as in him the
   dissolution of body and soul was no dissolution of the hypostatical
   union, so there is nothing that constrains us to say, that though the
   flesh of Christ had seen corruption and incineration in the grave, this
   had not been any dissolution of the hypostatical union, for the Divine
   nature, the Godhead, might have remained with all the elements and
   principles of Christ's body, as well as it did with the two
   constitutive parts of his person, his body and his soul. This
   incorruption then was not in Joseph's gums and spices, nor was it in
   Christ's innocency, and exemption from original sin, nor was it (that
   is, it is not necessary to say it was) in the hypostatical union. But
   this incorruptibleness of his flesh is most conveniently placed in
   that; Non dabis, thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption;
   we look no further for causes or reasons in the mysteries of religion,
   but to the will and pleasure of God; Christ himself limited his
   inquisition in that ita est, even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in
   thy sight. Christ's body did not see corruption, therefore, because God
   had decreed it should not. The humble soul (and only the humble soul is
   the religious soul) rests himself upon God's purposes and the decrees
   of God which he hath declared and manifested, not such as are conceived
   and imagined in ourselves, though upon some probability, some
   verisimilitude; so in our present case Peter proceeds in his sermon at
   Jerusalem, and so Paul in his at Antioch. [20] They preached Christ to
   have been risen without seeing corruption, not only because God had
   decreed it, but because he had manifested that decree in his prophet,
   therefore doth Saint Paul cite by special number the second Psalm for
   that decree, and therefore both Saint Peter and Saint Paul cite for it
   that place in the sixteenth Psalm; [21] for when God declares his
   decree and purpose in the express words of his prophet, or when he
   declares it in the real execution of the decree, then he makes it ours,
   then he manifests it to us. And therefore, as the mysteries of our
   religion are not the objects of our reason, but by faith we rest on
   God's decree and purpose--(it is so, O God, because it is thy will it
   should be so)--so God's decrees are ever to be considered in the
   manifestation thereof. All manifestation is either in the word of God,
   or in the execution of the decree; and when these two concur and meet
   it is the strongest demonstration that can be: when therefore I find
   those marks of adoption and spiritual filiation which are delivered in
   the word of God to be upon me; when I find that real execution of his
   good purpose upon me, as that actually I do live under the obedience
   and under the conditions which are evidences of adoption and spiritual
   filiation; then, so long as I see these marks and live so, I may safely
   comfort myself in a holy certitude and a modest infallibility of my
   adoption. Christ determines himself in that, the purpose of God was
   manifest to him; Saint Peter and Saint Paul determine themselves in
   those two ways of knowing the purpose of God, the word of God before
   the execution of the decree in the fulness of time. It was prophesied
   before, said they, and it is performed now, Christ is risen without
   seeing corruption. Now, this which is so singularly peculiar to him,
   that his flesh should not see corruption, at his second coming, his
   coming to judgment, shall extend to all that are then alive; their
   hestae shall not see corruption, because, as the apostle says, and says
   as a secret, as a mystery, Behold I shew you a mystery, we shall not
   all sleep (that is, not continue in the state of the dead in the
   grave), but we shall all be changed in an instant, we shall have a
   dissolution, and in the same instant a redintegration, a recompacting
   of body and soul, and that shall be truly a death and truly a
   resurrection, but no sleeping in corruption; but for us that die now
   and sleep in the state of the dead, we must all pass this posthume
   death, this death after death, nay, this death after burial, this
   dissolution after dissolution, this death of corruption and
   putrefaction, of vermiculation and incineration, of dissolution and
   dispersion in and from the grave, when these bodies that have been the
   children of royal parents, and the parents of royal children, must say
   with Job, Corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, Thou art my
   mother and my sister. Miserable riddle, when the same worm must be my
   mother, and my sister and myself! Miserable incest, when I must be
   married to my mother and my sister, and be both father and mother to my
   own mother and sister, beget and bear that worm which is all that
   miserable penury; when my mouth shall be filled with dust, and the worm
   shall feed, and feed sweetly[369] [22] upon me; when the ambitious man
   shall have no satisfaction, if the poorest alive tread upon him, nor
   the poorest receive any contentment in being made equal to princes, for
   they shall be equal but in dust. One dieth at his full strength, being
   wholly at ease and in quiet; and another dies in the bitterness of his
   soul, and never eats with pleasure; but they lie down alike in the
   dust, and the worm covers them. [23] In Job and in Isaiah, [24] it
   covers them and is spread under them, the worm is spread under thee,
   and the worm covers thee. There are the mats and the carpets that lie
   under, and there are the state and the canopy that hang over the
   greatest of the sons of men. Even those bodies that were the temples of
   the Holy Ghost come to this dilapidation, to ruin, to rubbish, to dust;
   even the Israel of the Lord, and Jacob himself, hath no other
   specification, no other denomination, but that vermis Jacob, thou worm
   of Jacob. Truly the consideration of this posthume death, this death
   after burial, that after God (with whom are the issues of death) hath
   delivered me from the death of the womb, by bringing me into the world,
   and from the manifold deaths of the world, by laying me in the grave, I
   must die again in an incineration of this flesh, and in a dispersion of
   that dust. That that monarch, who spread over many nations alive, must
   in his dust lie in a corner of that sheet of lead, and there but so
   long as that lead will last; and that private and retired man, that
   thought himself his own for ever, and never came forth, must in his
   dust of the grave be published, and (such are the revolutions of the
   grave) be mingled with the dust of every highway and of every dunghill,
   and swallowed in every puddle and pond. This is the most inglorious and
   contemptible vilification, the most deadly and peremptory nullification
   of man, that we can consider. God seems to have carried the declaration
   of his power to a great height, when he sets the prophet Ezekiel in the
   valley of dry bones, and says, Son of man, can these bones live? as
   though it had been impossible, and yet they did; the Lord laid sinews
   upon them, and flesh, and breathed into them, and they did live. But in
   that case there were bones to be seen, something visible, of which it
   might be said, Can this thing live? But in this death of incineration
   and dispersion of dust, we see nothing that we call that man's. If we
   say, Can this dust live? Perchance it cannot; it may be the mere dust
   of the earth, which never did live, never shall. It may be the dust of
   that man's worm, which did live, but shall no more. It may be the dust
   of another man, that concerns not him of whom it was asked. This death
   of incineration and dispersion is, to natural reason, the most
   irrecoverable death of all; and yet Domini Domini sunt exitus mortis,
   unto God the Lord belong the issues of death; and by recompacting this
   dust into the same body, and remaining the same body with the same
   soul, he shall in a blessed and glorious resurrection give me such an
   issue from this death as shall never pass into any other death, but
   establish me into a life that shall last as long as the Lord of Life
   himself.

   And so have you that that belongs to the first acceptation of these
   words (unto God the Lord belong the issues of death); That though from
   the womb to the grave, and in the grave itself, we pass from death to
   death, yet, as Daniel speaks, the Lord our God is able to deliver us,
   and he will deliver us.

   And so we pass unto our second accommodation of these words (unto God
   the Lord belong the issues of death); that it belongs to God, and not
   to man, to pass a judgment upon us at our death, or to conclude a
   dereliction on God's part upon the manner thereof.

   Those indications which the physicians receive, and those presagitions
   which they give for death or recovery in the patient, they receive and
   they give out of the grounds and the rules of their art, but we have no
   such rule or art to give a presagition of spiritual death and damnation
   upon any such indication as we see in any dying man; we see often
   enough to be sorry, but not to despair; we may be deceived both ways:
   we use to comfort ourself in the death of a friend, if it be testified
   that he went away like a lamb, that is, without any reluctation; but
   God knows that may be accompanied with a dangerous damp and
   stupefaction, and insensibility of his present state. Our blessed
   Saviour suffered colluctations with death, and a sadness even in his
   soul to death, and an agony even to a bloody sweat in his body, and
   expostulations with God, and exclamations upon the cross. He was a
   devout man who said upon his death-bed, or death-turf (for he was a
   hermit), Septuaginta annos Domino servivisti, et mori times? Hast thou
   served a good master threescore and ten years, and now art thou loth to
   go into his presence? Yet Hilarion was loth. Barlaam was a devout man
   (a hermit too) that said that day he died, Cogita te hodie caepisse
   servire Domino, et hodie finiturum, Consider this to be the first day's
   service that ever thou didst thy Master, to glorify him in a
   Christianly and a constant death, and if thy first day be thy last day
   too, how soon dost thou come to receive thy wages! Yet Barlaam could
   have been content to have stayed longer forth. Make no ill conclusions
   upon any man's lothness to die, for the mercies of God work momentarily
   in minutes, and many times insensibly to bystanders, or any other than
   the party departing. And then upon violent deaths inflicted as upon
   malefactors, Christ himself hath forbidden us by his own death to make
   any ill conclusion; for his own death had those impressions in it; he
   was reputed, he was executed as a malefactor, and no doubt many of them
   who concurred to his death did believe him to be so. Of sudden death
   there are scarce examples be found in the Scriptures upon good men, for
   death in battle cannot be called sudden death; but God governs not by
   examples but by rules, and therefore make no ill conclusion upon sudden
   death nor upon distempers neither, though perchance accompanied with
   some words of diffidence and distrust in the mercies of God. The tree
   lies as it falls, it is true, but it is not the last stroke that fells
   the tree, nor the last word nor gasp that qualifies the soul. Still
   pray we for a peaceable life against violent death, and for time of
   repentance against sudden death, and for sober and modest assurance
   against distempered and diffident death, but never make ill conclusions
   upon persons overtaken with such deaths; Domini Domini sunt exitus
   mortis, to God the Lord belong the issues of death. And he received
   Samson, who went out of this world in such a manner (consider it
   actively, consider it passively in his own death, and in those whom he
   slew with himself) as was subject to interpretation hard enough. Yet
   the Holy Ghost hath moved Saint Paul to celebrate Samson in his great
   catalogue, [25] and so doth all the church. Our critical day is not the
   very day of our death, but the whole course of our life. I thank him
   that prays for me when the bell tolls, but I thank him much more that
   catechises me, or preaches to me, or instructs me how to live. Fac hoc
   et vive, there is my security, the mouth of the Lord hath said it, do
   this and thou shalt live. But though I do it, yet I shall die too, die
   a bodily, a natural death. But God never mentions, never seems to
   consider that death, the bodily, the natural death. God doth not say,
   Live well, and thou shalt die well, that is, an easy, a quiet death;
   but, Live well here, and thou shalt live well for ever. As the first
   part of a sentence pieces well with the last, and never respects, never
   hearkens after the parenthesis that comes between, so doth a good life
   here flow into an eternal life, without any consideration what so
   manner of death we die. But whether the gate of my prison be opened
   with an oiled key (by a gentle and preparing sickness), or the gate be
   hewn down by a violent death, or the gate be burnt down by a raging and
   frantic fever, a gate into heaven I shall have, for from the Lord is
   the cause of my life, and with God the Lord are the issues of death.
   And further we carry not this second acceptation of the words, as this
   issue of death is liberatio in morte, God's care that the soul be safe,
   what agonies soever the body suffers in the hour of death.

   But pass to our third part and last part: As this issue of death is
   liberatio per mortem, a deliverance by the death of another.
   Sufferentiam Job audiisti, et vidisti finem Domini, says Saint James
   (v. 11), You have heard of the patience of Job, says he: all this while
   you have done that, for in every man, calamitous, miserable man, a Job
   speaks. Now, see the end of the Lord, sayeth that apostle, which is not
   that end that the Lord proposed to himself (salvation to us), nor the
   end which he proposes to us (conformity to him), but see the end of the
   Lord, says he, the end that the Lord himself came to, death, and a
   painful and a shameful death. But why did he die? and why die so? Quia
   Domini Domini sunt exitus mortis (as Saint Augustine, interpreting this
   text, answers that question), [26] because to this God our Lord
   belonged the issues of death. Quid apertius diceretur? says he there,
   what can be more obvious, more manifest than this sense of these words?
   In the former part of this verse it is said, He that is our God is the
   God of salvation; Deus salvos faciendi, so he reads it, the God that
   must save us. Who can that be, says he, but Jesus? For therefore that
   name was given him because he was to save us. And to this Jesus, says
   he, this Saviour, [27] belong the issues of death; Nec oportuit eum de
   hac vita alios exitus habere quam mortis: being come into this life in
   our mortal nature, he could not go out of this life any other way but
   by death. Ideo dictum, says he, therefore it is said, to God the Lord
   belonged the issues of death; ut ostenderetur moriendo nos salvos
   facturum, to show that his way to save us was to die. And from this
   text doth Saint Isidore prove that Christ was truly man (which as many
   sects of heretics denied, as that he was truly God), because to him,
   though he were Dominus Dominus (as the text doubles it), God the Lord,
   yet to him, to God the Lord belonged the issues of death; oportuit eum
   pati; more cannot be said than Christ himself says of himself; These
   things Christ ought to suffer; [28] he had no other way but death: so
   then this part of our sermon must needs be a passion sermon, since all
   his life was a continual passion, all our Lent may well be a continual
   Good Friday. Christ's painful life took off none of the pains of his
   death, he felt not the less then for having felt so much before. Nor
   will any thing that shall be said before lessen, but rather enlarge the
   devotion, to that which shall be said of his passion at the time of due
   solemnization thereof. Christ bled not a drop the less at the last for
   having bled at his circumcision before, nor will you a tear the less
   then if you shed some now. And therefore be now content to consider
   with me how to this God the Lord belonged the issues of death. That
   God, this Lord, the Lord of life, could die, is a strange
   contemplation; that the Red Sea could be dry, that the sun could stand
   still, that an oven could be seven times heat and not burn, that lions
   could be hungry and not bite, is strange, miraculously strange, but
   super-miraculous that God could die; but that God would die is an
   exaltation of that. But even of that also it is a super-exaltation,
   that God should die, must die, and non exitus (said Saint Augustine),
   God the Lord had no issue but by death, and oportuit pati (says Christ
   himself), all this Christ ought to suffer, was bound to suffer; Deus
   ultimo Deus, says David, God is the God of revenges, he would not pass
   over the son of man unrevenged, unpunished. But then Deus ultionum
   libere egit (says that place), the God of revenges works freely, he
   punishes, he spares whom he will. And would he not spare himself? he
   would not: Dilectio fortis ut mors, love is strong as death; [29]
   stronger, it drew in death, that naturally is not welcome. Si
   possibile, says Christ, if it be possible, let this cup pass, when his
   love, expressed in a former decree with his Father, had made it
   impossible. Many waters quench not love. [30] Christ tried many: he was
   baptised out of his love, and his love determined not there; he mingled
   blood with water in his agony, and that determined not his love; he
   wept pure blood, all his blood at all his eyes, at all his pores, in
   his flagellation and thorns (to the Lord our God belonged the issues of
   blood), and these expressed, but these did not quench his love. He
   would not spare, nay, he could not spare himself. There was nothing
   more free, more voluntary, more spontaneous than the death of Christ.
   It is true, libere egit, he died voluntarily; but yet when we consider
   the contract that had passed between his Father and him, there was an
   oportuit, a kind of necessity upon him: all this Christ ought to
   suffer. And when shall we date this obligation, this oportuit, this
   necessity? When shall we say that began? Certainly this decree by which
   Christ was to suffer all this was an eternal decree, and was there any
   thing before that that was eternal? Infinite love, eternal love; be
   pleased to follow this home, and to consider it seriously, that what
   liberty soever we can conceive in Christ to die or not to die; this
   necessity of dying, this decree is as eternal as that liberty; and yet
   how small a matter made he of this necessity and this dying? His Father
   calls it but a bruise, and but a bruising of his heel [31] (the serpent
   shall bruise his heel), and yet that was, that the serpent should
   practise and compass his death. Himself calls it but a baptism, as
   though he were to be the better for it. I have a baptism to be baptized
   with, [32] and he was in pain till it was accomplished, and yet this
   baptism was his death. The Holy Ghost calls it joy (for the joy which
   was set before him he endured the cross), [33] which was not a joy of
   his reward after his passion, but a joy that filled him even in the
   midst of his torments, and arose from him; when Christ calls his
   calicem a cup, and no worse (Can ye drink of my cup) [34] , he speaks
   not odiously, not with detestation of it. Indeed it was a cup, salus
   mundo, a health to all the world. And quid retribuam, says David, What
   shall I render to the Lord? [35] Answer you with David, Accipiam
   calicem, I will take the cup of salvation; take it, that cup is
   salvation, his passion, if not into your present imitation, yet into
   your present contemplation. And behold how that Lord that was God, yet
   could die, would die, must die for our salvation. That Moses and Elias
   talked with Christ in the transfiguration, both Saint Matthew and Saint
   Mark [36] tells us, but what they talked of, only Saint Luke; Dicebant
   excessum ejus, says he, They talked of his disease, of his death, which
   was to be accomplished at Jerusalem. [37] The word is of his exodus,
   the very word of our text, exitus, his issue by death. Moses, who in
   his exodus had prefigured this issue of our Lord, and in passing Israel
   out of Egypt through the Red Sea, had foretold in that actual prophecy,
   Christ passing of mankind through the sea of his blood; and Elias,
   whose exodus and issue of this world was a figure of Christ's
   ascension; had no doubt a great satisfaction in talking with our
   blessed Lord, de excessu ejus, of the full consummation of all this in
   his death, which was to be accomplished at Jerusalem. Our meditation of
   his death should be more visceral, and affect us more, because it is of
   a thing already done. The ancient Romans had a certain tenderness and
   detestation of the name of death; they could not name death, no, not in
   their wills; there they could not say, Si mori contigerit, but si quid
   humanitas contingat, not if or when I die, but when the course of
   nature is accomplished upon me. To us that speak daily of the death of
   Christ (he was crucified, dead, and buried), can the memory or the
   mention of our own death be irksome or bitter? There are in these
   latter times amongst us that name death freely enough, and the death of
   God, but in blasphemous oaths and execrations. Miserable men, who shall
   therefore be said never to have named Jesus, because they have named
   him too often; and therefore hear Jesus say, Nescivi vos, I never knew
   you, because they made themselves too familiar with him. Moses and
   Elias talked with Christ of his death only in a holy and joyful sense,
   of the benefit which they and all the world were to receive by that.
   Discourses of religion should not be out of curiosity, but to
   edification. And then they talked with Christ of his death at that time
   when he was in the greatest height of glory, that ever he admitted in
   this world, that is, his transfiguration. And we are afraid to speak to
   the great men of this world of their death, but nourish in them a vain
   imagination of immortality and immutability. But bonum est nobis esse
   hic (as Saint Peter said there), It is good to dwell here, in this
   consideration of his death, and therefore transfer we our tabernacle
   (our devotions) through some of those steps which God the Lord made to
   his issue of death that day. Take in the whole day from the hour that
   Christ received the passover upon Thursday unto the hour in which he
   died the next day. Make this present day that day in thy devotion, and
   consider what he did, and remember what you have done. Before he
   instituted and celebrated the sacrament (which was after the eating of
   the passover), he proceeded to that act of humility, to wash his
   disciples' feet, even Peter's, who for a while resisted him. In thy
   preparation to the holy and blessed sacrament, hast thou with a sincere
   humility sought a reconciliation with all the world, even with those
   that have been averse from it, and refused that reconciliation from
   thee? If so, and not else, thou hast spent that first part of his last
   day in a conformity with him. After the sacrament he spent the time
   till night in prayer, in preaching, in psalms: hast thou considered
   that a worthy receiving of the sacrament consists in a continuation of
   holiness after, as well as in a preparation before? If so, thou hast
   therein also conformed thyself to him; so Christ spent his time till
   night. At night he went into the garden to pray, and he prayed
   prolixious, he spent much time in prayer, how much? Because it is
   literally expressed, that he prayed there three several times, [38] and
   that returning to his disciples after his first prayer, and finding
   them asleep, said, Could ye not watch with me one hour, [39] it is
   collected that he spent three hours in prayer. I dare scarce ask thee
   whither thou wentest, or how thou disposedst of thyself, when it grew
   dark and after last night. If that time were spent in a holy
   recommendation of thyself to God, and a submission of thy will to his,
   it was spent in a conformity to him. In that time, and in those
   prayers, was his agony and bloody sweat. I will hope that thou didst
   pray; but not every ordinary and customary prayer, but prayer actually
   accompanied with shedding of tears and dispositively in a readiness to
   shed blood for his glory in necessary cases, puts thee into a
   conformity with him. About midnight he was taken and bound with a kiss,
   art thou not too conformable to him in that? Is not that too literally,
   too exactly thy case, at midnight to have been taken and bound with a
   kiss? From thence he was carried back to Jerusalem, first to Annas,
   then to Caiaphas, and (as late as it was) then he was examined and
   buffered, and delivered over to the custody of those officers from whom
   he received all those irrisions, and violences, the covering of his
   face, the spitting upon his face, the blasphemies of words, and the
   smartness of blows, which that gospel mentions: in which compass fell
   that gallicinium, that crowing of the cock which called up Peter to his
   repentance. How thou passedst all that time thou knowest. If thou didst
   any thing that needest Peter's tears, and hast not shed them, let me be
   thy cock, do it now. Now, thy Master (in the unworthiest of his
   servants) looks back upon thee, do it now. Betimes, in the morning, so
   soon as it was day, the Jews held a council in the high priest's hall,
   and agreed upon their evidence against him, and then carried him to
   Pilate, who was to be his judge; didst thou accuse thyself when thou
   wakedst this morning, and wast thou content even with false
   accusations, that is, rather to suspect actions to have been sin, which
   were not, than to smother and justify such as were truly sins? Then
   thou spentest that hour in conformity to him; Pilate found no evidence
   against him, and therefore to ease himself, and to pass a compliment
   upon Herod, tetrarch of Galilee, who was at that time at Jerusalem
   (because Christ, being a Galilean, was of Herod's jurisdiction), Pilate
   sent him to Herod, and rather as a madman than a malefactor; Herod
   remanded him (with scorn) to Pilate, to proceed against him; and this
   was about eight of the clock. Hast thou been content to come to this
   inquisition, this examination, this agitation, this cribration, this
   pursuit of thy conscience; to sift it, to follow it from the sins of
   thy youth to thy present sins, from the sins of thy bed to the sins of
   thy board, and from the substance to the circumstance of thy sins? That
   is time spent like thy Saviour's. Pilate would have saved Christ, by
   using the privilege of the day in his behalf, because that day one
   prisoner was to be delivered, but they choose Barabbas; he would have
   saved him from death, by satisfying their fury with inflicting other
   torments upon him, scourging and crowning with thorns, and loading him
   with many scornful and ignominious contumelies, but they regarded him
   not, they pressed a crucifying. Hast thou gone about to redeem thy sin,
   by fasting, by alms, by disciplines and mortifications, in way of
   satisfaction to the justice of God? That will not serve that is not the
   right way; we press an utter crucifying of that sin that governs thee:
   and that conforms thee to Christ. Towards noon Pilate gave judgment,
   and they made such haste to execution as that by noon he was upon the
   cross. There now hangs that sacred body upon the cross, rebaptized in
   his own tears, and sweat, and embalmed in his own blood alive. There
   are those bowels of compassion which are so conspicuous, so manifested,
   as that you may see them through his wounds. There those glorious eyes
   grew faint in their sight, so as the sun, ashamed to survive them,
   departed with his light too. And then that Son of God, who was never
   from us, and yet had now come a new way unto us in assuming our nature,
   delivers that soul (which was never out of his Father's hands) by a new
   way, a voluntary emission of it into his Father's hands; for though to
   this God our Lord belonged these issues of death, so that considered in
   his own contract, he must necessarily die, yet at no breach or battery
   which they had made upon his sacred body issued his soul; but emisit,
   he gave up the ghost; and as God breathed a soul into the first Adam,
   so this second Adam breathed his soul into God, into the hands of God.

   There we leave you in that blessed dependency, to hang upon him that
   hangs upon the cross, there bathe in his tears, there suck at his
   wounds, and lie down in peace in his grave, till he vouchsafe you a
   resurrection, and an ascension into that kingdom which He hath prepared
   for you with the inestimable price of his incorruptible blood. Amen.
