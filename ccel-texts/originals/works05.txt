SERMON LXXXV.

  THE SIN AND DANGER OF ADDING TO THE DOCTRINE OF THE GOSPEL.

   But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto
   you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As
   we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel
   unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accursed.--Gal. i. 8,
   9.

   BEFORE I come to handle the words, for the better understanding of
   them, I shall give a brief account of the occasion of them, which was
   this:--some false apostles had made a great disturbance in the churches
   planted by the apostles of Christ, by teaching that it was necessary
   for Christians, not only to embrace and entertain the doctrines and
   precepts of the Christian religion, but likewise to he circumcised, and
   keep the law of Moses. Of this disturbance, which was raised in the
   Christian church, yon have the history at large, Acts xv. and as in
   several other churches, so particularly in that of Galatia, these false
   apostles and seducers had perverted many, as appears by this Epistle;
   in the beginning whereof St. Paul complains, that those who were
   seduced into this error, of the necessity of circumcision, and keeping
   the law of Moses, had, by this new article of faith, which they had
   added to the Christian religion, quite altered the frame of it, and
   made the gospel another thing from that which our Saviour delivered,
   and commanded his apostles to teach all nations.

   For he tells us (ver. 6. of this chapter), that he "marvelled, that
   they were so soon removed from him that called them by (or through) the
   grace of Christ, unto another gospel," that is so different from that
   which they had been instructed in by those who first preached the
   gospel unto them: for the making of any thing necessary to salvation,
   which our Saviour in his gospel had not made so, he calls another
   gospel. "I marvel, that ye are so soon removed from him that called you
   by the grace of Christ, unto another gospel; which is not another," ho
   ouk estin allo, which is no other thing, or by which I mean nothing
   else, "but that there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the
   gospel of Christ;" as if he had said, When I say that ye are removed to
   another gospel, I do not mean that ye have renounced Christianity, and
   are gone over to another religion; but that ye are seduced by those who
   have a mind to pervert the gospel of Christ, by adding something to it,
   as a necessary and essential part of it, which Christ hath not made so:
   this the apostle calls a perverting or overthrowing of the gospel;
   because, by thus altering the terms and conditions of it, they made it
   quite another thing from what our Saviour delivered it.

   And then at the eighth and ninth verses he denounceth a terrible
   anathema against those, whoever they should be, yea, though it were an
   apostle, or an angel from heaven, who by thus "perverting the gospel of
   Christ" (that is, by making any thing necessary to be believed or
   practised, which our Saviour in his gospel hath not made so), should in
   effect "preach another gospel;" "but though we, or an angel from
   heaven, preach any other gospel unto you, than that which we have
   preached unto you, let him be anathema," an accursed thing. And then,
   to express his confidence and vehemency in this matter, and to shew
   that he did not speak this rashly and in a heat, but upon due
   consideration, he repeats it again in the next verse, "As we said
   before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto
   you, than that ye have received, let him be accursed."

   From the words thus explained by the consideration of the context, and
   of the main scope and design of this Epistle, these following
   observations do naturally arise:

   First, That the addition of any thing to the Christian religion, as
   necessary to be believed and practised in order to salvation, is a
   perverting the gospel of Christ, and preaching another gospel.

   Secondly, That no pretence of infallibility is sufficient to authorize
   and warrant the addition of any thing to the Christian doctrine, as
   necessary to be believed and practised in order to salvation.

   Thirdly, That Christians may judge and discern when such additions are
   made.

   Fourthly, and consequently, That since the declaration of the gospel,
   and the confirmation of it, there is no authority in the Christian
   church to impose upon Christians any thing as of necessity to
   salvation, which the gospel hath not made so.

   Fifthly, That there is no visible judge (how infallible soever he may
   pretend to be) to whose definitions and declarations in matters of
   faith and practice, necessary to salvation, we are bound to submit,
   without examination, whether these things be agreeable to the gospel of
   Christ, or not.

   Sixthly, and lastly, Whosoever teacheth any thing as of necessity to
   salvation, to be believed or practised, besides what the gospel of
   Christ hath made necessary, doth fall under the anathema here in the
   text, because, in so doing, he perverteth the gospel of Christ, and
   preacheth another gospel. Now the apostle expressly declares, that
   "though we (that is, he himself, or any of the apostles), or an angel
   from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you, than what we have
   preached unto you, let him be accursed; as we said before, so say I now
   again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you, than that ye have
   received, let him be accursed."

   I. That the addition of any thing to the Christian religion, as
   necessary to be believed or practised in order to salvation, is a
   perverting of the gospel of Christ, and preaching another gospel.

   This is evident from the instances here given in this Epistle; for the
   apostle chargeth the false apostles with perverting the gospel of
   Christ, and preaching another gospel, upon no other account, but
   because they added to the Christian religion, and made circumcision,
   and the keeping of the law of Moses, an essential part of the Christian
   religion, and imposed upon Christians the practice of these things, and
   the belief of the necessity of them, as a condition of eternal
   salvation.

   That this was the doctrine of those false teachers, we find expressly:
   (Acts xv. 1.) "And certain men which came down from Judea, taught the
   brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses,
   ye cannot be saved;" and (ver. 24.) in the letter written by the
   apostles and elders at Jerusalem, to the churches abroad, there is this
   account given of it; "Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which
   went out from us, have troubled you with words, subverting your souls,
   saying ye must be circumcised, and keep the law, to whom we gave no
   such commandment." Where you see that this doctrine is declared to be
   of pernicious consequence, tending to subvert the souls of men, and
   likewise to be an addition to the doctrine of the gospel which was
   delivered by the apostles, who here with one consent declare, that they
   had given "no such commandment;" that is, had delivered no such
   doctrine as this, nor put any such yoke upon the necks of Christians;
   but on the contrary had declared, that the death of Christ having put
   an end to the Jewish dispensation, there was now no obligation upon
   Christians to observe the law of Moses.

   And from the reason of the thing it is very plain, that the addition of
   any thing to the Christian religion, as necessary to be believed or
   practised in order to salvation, which the gospel hath not made so, is
   preaching another gospel; because it makes an essential change in the
   terms and conditions of the gospel-covenant, which declares salvation
   unto men upon such and such terms, and no other. Now to add any other
   terms to these, as of equal necessity with them, is to alter the
   condition of the covenant of the gospel, and the terms of the Christian
   religion, and consequently to preach another gospel, by declaring other
   terms of salvation, than Christ in his gospel hath declared, which is
   to pervert the gospel of Christ.

   II. No pretence of infallibility is sufficient to authorize and warrant
   the addition of any thing to the Christian doctrine, as necessary to be
   believed or practised, in order to salvation. After the delivery of the
   gospel by the Son of God, and the publication of it to the world by his
   apostles, who were commissioned and inspired by him to that purpose,
   and the confirmation of all, by the greatest and most unquestionable
   miracles that ever were, no person whatever that brought any other
   doctrine, and declared salvation to men on any other terms than those
   which are declared in the gospel, was to be credited, what pretence
   soever he should make to a Divine commission or an infallible
   assistance. The apostle makes a supposition as high as can be: "Though
   we (says he) or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you,
   than that which we have preached unto you, let him be an anathema." If
   the apostles themselves, who were divinely commissioned, and infallibly
   assisted in the preaching of the gospel, should afterwards make any
   addition to it, or declare any other terms of salvation, than those
   which are declared in the gospel which they had already published to
   the world, they ought not to be regarded.

   And the reason is plain; because, what claim soever any person may make
   to infallibility, and what demonstration soever he may give of it, we
   cannot possibly believe him, if he contradict himself, and deliver
   doctrines which do plainly clash with one another: for if he spake true
   at first, I can not believe him, declaring the contrary afterwards: and
   if he did not speak true at first, I cannot believe him at all; because
   he can give no greater proof of his Divine commission, and infallible
   assistance and inspiration, than he did at first.

   And the reason is the same, if an angel from heaven should come and
   preach a contrary doctrine to that of the gospel, he were not to be
   believed neither; because he could bring no better credentials of his
   Divine commission and authority, than those had who published the
   gospel; and, consequently, he ought not to be credited in any thing
   contrary to what they had published before. For though a man were never
   so much disposed to receive a revelation from God, and to submit his
   faith to it, yet it is not possible for any man to believe God against
   God himself; that is, to believe two revelations, plainly contradictory
   to one another, to be from God; and the reason of this is very obvious,
   because every man doth first, and more firmly, believe this proposition
   or principle, that contradictions cannot be true, than any revelation
   whatsoever; for if contradictions may be true, then no revelation from
   God can signify any thing, because the contrary may be equally true,
   and so truth and falsehood be all one.

   The apostle indeed only makes a supposition, when he says, "though we
   or an angel from heaven preach any other doctrine unto you;" but by
   this supposition he plainly bars any man, or company of men, from
   adding to the Christian religion any article of faith, or point of
   practice, as of necessity to salvation, which the gospel hath not made
   so: I say, any man, or company of men, whatever authority or
   infallibility they may lay claim to; because they cannot pretend to a
   clearer commission, and greater evidence of infallible assistance, than
   an apostle, or an angel from heaven, and yet the text tells us, that
   would not be a sufficient warrant to preach another gospel; it might,
   indeed, bring in question that which they had preached before, but
   could not give credit and authority to any thing plainly contrary to
   it, and inconsistent with it.

   III. Christians may judge and discern when another gospel is preached,
   when new articles of faith, or points of practice not enjoined by the
   gospel, are imposed upon Christians. This the apostle supposeth every
   particular church, and, for aught I know, every particular Christian,
   that is duly instructed in the Christian religion, to be a competent
   judge of, and to be sufficiently able to discern when another gospel is
   preached, and new terms and conditions, not declared in the gospel, are
   added to the Christian religion; for if they be not able to judge of
   this, the apostle does in vain caution them against the seduction of
   those who perverted the doctrine of Christ, and endeavoured to remove
   them from him that had called them by the grace of Christ, unto another
   gospel.

   It may perhaps be said, that there was no need that they should be able
   to discern and judge of the doctrines of those false teachers; it was
   sufficient for them to believe the apostle concerning the doctrines of
   those seducers, when he declared to them the falsehood and pernicious
   consequence of them. But the apostle speaks to them upon another
   supposition, which does necessarily imply, that they were able to
   discern and judge what doctrines were agreeable to the gospel, and what
   not; for he puts the case, that if he himself, or any of the apostles,
   or an angel from heaven, should preach to them another doctrine,
   contrary to that of the gospel, they ought to reject it with
   detestation; but this doth necessarily suppose them able to judge, when
   such doctrines were preached, and consequently, that all things
   necessarily to be believed and practised by all Christians, are clearly
   and plainly declared in the gospel; all the doctrines whereof are now
   contained in the Holy Scriptures, in which all things necessary to
   faith and a good life are so plainly delivered, that any sober and
   inquisitive person may learn them from thence: and the meanest
   capacity, by the help and direction of their guides and teachers, may
   be instructed in them.

   And this is not only the principle of protestants, but the express and
   constant doctrine of the ancient fathers of the church, whatever the
   church of Rome, for the maintaining of her usurped authority over the
   consciences of men, pretends to the contrary. And if this were not so,
   that men are able to discern and judge which are the doctrines of the
   gospel and what is contrary to them, the doctrine of the gospel was in
   vain preached, and the Holy Scriptures containing that doctrine were
   written to no purpose.

   Some things in Scripture are granted to be obscure and difficult, on
   purpose to exercise the study and inquiries of those who have leisure
   and capacity for it; but all things necessary are sufficiently plain;
   otherwise it would be impossible to judge when another gospel is
   preached, which the apostle here supposeth the Galatians capable of
   doing. For if the revelation of the gospel be not sufficiently plain,
   in all things necessary to be believed and practised, then Christians
   have no rule whereby to judge what doctrines are agreeable to the
   gospel, and what not, for an obscure rule is of no use; that is, in
   truth, is no rule to those to whom it is obscure.

   I proceed to the fourth observation, which is plainly consequent from
   those laid down before; namely, that since the declaration of the
   gospel, and the confirmation given to it, there is no authority in the
   Christian church to impose upon Christians any thing, as of necessity
   to salvation, which the gospel hath not made so.

   The commission given by our Lord and Saviour to his apostles, was to
   preach the gospel to all nations (or, as St. Matthew expresses it), to
   go and teach all nations to observe all things whatsoever he had
   commanded them; and this is that which we call the gospel, viz. that
   doctrine which Christ commanded to preach and publish to the world;
   and, if the apostles themselves had exceeded their commission, and
   added any other points of faith or practice to those which our Saviour
   gave them in charge to teach and publish to the world, they had, in so
   doing, been guilty of that which St. Paul here in the text chargeth the
   false apostles with, viz. of preaching another gospel. And if the
   apostles had no authority to add any thing to the gospel, much less can
   any others pretend to it, since they have neither so immediate a
   commission, nor such a miraculous power to give testimony to them, that
   "they are teachers come from God."

   Now this doctrine of the gospel, which the apostles preached to the
   world, is that which Christians are so often, and so earnestly by the
   apostles in all their epistles, exhorted to continue in, and not to
   suffer themselves to be shaken in mind by every wind of new doctrine;
   because that which the apostles had delivered to them, was the entire
   doctrine of the gospel, which was never to receive any addition or
   alteration. This is that which St. Peter calls "the holy commandment
   which was delivered unto them." (2 Pet. ii. 21.) "It had been better
   for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they
   have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them;"
   speaking, in all probability, of those who were seduced by the errors
   of the Gnostics, from the purity of the Christian doctrine delivered to
   them by the apostles. This, likewise, St. Paul calls "the common
   faith;" (Titus i. iv.) and St. Jude, (ver 3.) "the common salvation;"
   that is, the doctrine which contains the common terms of our salvation,
   and "the faith which was once delivered to the saints;" that is, by the
   apostles of our Lord, who published the gospel; once delivered, that
   is, once for all, so as never afterwards to admit of any change or
   alteration. This faith he exhorts Christians "earnestly to contend
   for," against those several sects of seducers, which were crept into
   the Christian church, and did endeavour, by several arts, to pervert
   the gospel of Christ, and to deprave the faith delivered by the
   apostles.

   So that the doctrine of the gospel published by the apostles is fixed
   and unalterable; and there can be no authority in the church to make
   any change in it, either by taking from it, or adding any thing to it,
   as necessary to be believed or practised in order to salvation.

   5. It follows likewise from the foregoing observations, that there is
   no visible judge (how much soever he may pretend to infallibility), to
   whose determination and decision, in matters of faith and practice
   necessary to salvation, Christians are bound to submit, without
   examination, whether those things be agreeable to the doctrine of the
   gospel, or not.

   When our Saviour appeared in the world, though he had authority enough
   to exact belief from men, yet, because there was a standing revelation
   of God made to the Jews, he appeals to that revelation, as well as to
   his own miracles, for the truth of what he said, and offered himself
   and his doctrine to be tried by the agreeableness of it to the
   Scriptures of the Old Testament, and the predictions therein concerning
   him. And this was but reasonable; it being impossible for any man to
   receive two revelations, as from God, without liberty to examine
   whether they be agreeable to, and consistent with, one another. In like
   manner the apostles of our Lord and Saviour, though they were guided
   and assisted by an infallible Spirit, and had an immediate commission
   from Christ to preach the doctrine of the gospel, did not require from
   men absolute submission to their doctrines and dictates, without
   examination of what they delivered, whether it were agree able to that
   Divine revelation which was contained in the ancient Scriptures.

   This was St. Paul's constant custom and way of teaching among the Jews,
   who had received the revelation of the Old Testament; he did not
   dictate to them by virtue of his infallibility, "but reasoned with them
   out of the Scriptures," and required their belief no further than what
   he said should, upon examination, appear agreeable to the Scriptures.
   So we find, Acts xvii. 2, 3. "And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto
   them (speaking of the Jews), and three sabbath days reasoned with them
   out of the Scriptures, opening and alleging, that Christ must needs
   have suffered and risen again from the dead, and that this Jesus, whom
   I preach unto you, is the Christ." And (chap. xviii. 28.) "he mightily
   convinced the Jews, and that publicly, shewing, by the Scriptures, that
   Jesus was the Christ." And St. Paul was so far from reproving them for
   examining his doctrine by the Scriptures, that he commended it, as an
   argument of a noble and generous mind in the Bereans, that they did not
   give full assent to his doctrine, till, upon due search and
   examination, they were satisfied that what he had said was agreeable to
   the Scriptures, (chap. xvii. 11, 12.) where, speaking of the Bereans,
   it is said, "That these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in
   that they received the word, with all readiness of mind, and searched
   the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so; therefore many of
   them believed;" that is, because upon search they found what he
   delivered to be agreeable to the Scriptures; and it was not a slight,
   but diligent and deliberate search, they took time to examine things
   thoroughly; for it is said, "they searched the Scriptures daily." And
   here, in the text, St. Paul puts the case, that if he, or any other of
   the apostles, concerning whose Divine commission and assistance they
   were so fully satisfied, should deliver any thing to them contrary to
   the gospel, which they had formerly preached, they were to reject it
   with the greatest abhorrence and detestation; and this necessarily
   supposeth a liberty to examine what was delivered, even by those whom
   they believed to be infallibly assisted, and a capacity to discern and
   judge whether what they said was agreeable to the gospel at first
   delivered to them or not.

   And, after this, shall any person or church (what claim soever they may
   make to infallibility), assume to themselves an authority to dictate in
   matters of faith, and that their dictates ought to be received with an
   absolute submission, and without liberty to examine whether they be
   agreeable to "the faith once delivered to the saints;" and though they
   add new articles to the Christian faith, and of which there is not the
   least footstep or intimation in any of the ancient creeds of the
   Christian church, and do plainly impose upon Christians the practice
   and belief of several things as necessary to salvation, which the
   gospel never declared to be so, yet no body shall judge of this, but
   every man ought, with out more ado, to believe blindfold, and to resign
   up his understanding and judgment to the directions of this infallible
   judge?

   But surely this is not the reasonable obedience of faith, but the
   forced submission of slaves to the tyranny of their masters. Christians
   are expressly forbid to call any man father or master upon earth,
   because we have one Father and Master in heaven. Now to make an
   absolute submission of our understandings to any upon earth, so as,
   without examination, to receive their dictates in matters of faith, is
   surely, if any thing can be so, to call such a person father or master,
   because a greater submission than this we cannot pay to our Father who
   is in heaven, even to God himself. I come now to the

   Sixth and last observation from the text; that whosoever teacheth any
   thing, as of necessity to salvation to be believed or practised,
   besides what the gospel of Christ hath made necessary, does fall under
   the anathema here in the text; because they that do so, do, according
   to the mind of St. Paul, pervert the gospel of Christ, and preach
   another gospel. For the reason why he chargeth the false apostles with
   preaching another gospel, and those that were seduced by them, as being
   "removed from him that called them by the grace of Christ unto another
   gospel," is plainly this--that they had changed the terms of the
   Christian religion, by adding new articles to it which were not
   contained in the gospel; that is, by making it necessary to believe it
   to be so, because they taught so. Now St. Paul expressly declares this
   to be "preaching another gospel," because they plainly altered the
   terms of salvation declared in the gospel, and made that to be
   necessary to the salvation of men, which the gospel had not made so.

   And whatever person or church does the same, does incur the same guilt,
   and falls under the anathema and censure here in the text; yea, though
   he were an apostle, or an angel; and I am sure no bishop or church in
   the world can pretend either to an equal authority or infallibility
   with an apostle, or an angel from heaven.

   Let us then hear what St. Paid declares in this case, and consider
   seriously with what earnestness and vehemency he declares it: "Though
   we (says he) or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you,
   than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we
   said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel
   unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accursed." St. Paul,
   you see, is very earnest in this matter, and very peremptory; and
   therefore I cannot but think this declaration of his to be more
   considerable, and every way more worthy of our regard and dread, than
   all the anathemas of the council of Trent, which, in direct affront and
   contempt of this anathema of St. Paul, hath presumed to add so many
   articles to the Christian religion, upon the counterfeit warrant of
   tradition, for which there is no ground or warrant from the Scripture,
   or from any ancient creed of the Christian church.

   And, for the truth of this, I appeal to the creed of Pope Pius IV.
   compiled out of the definitions of the council of Trent; by which
   council, the pope only is authorized to interpret the true sense and
   meaning of the canons and decrees of that council; and, consequently,
   his interpretations must be of equal force and authority with that of
   the council itself. So that whatsoever he hath put into his new creed
   for an article of faith, ought to be received with the same pious
   affection and veneration, as if the creed had been compiled by the
   council itself; because the pope, it seems, and nobody else,
   understands the true meaning of that council, at least is thought fit
   to declare it. And therefore one may justly wonder at the presumption
   of those, who, after this declaration of the council, have taken upon
   them to expound the catholic faith, and to represent that religion to
   us as it is defined in that council; because if there be any
   controversy about the meaning of its definitions (as there have been a
   great many, even betwixt those who were present at the council when
   those definitions were made), none but the pope himself can certainly
   tell the meaning of them.

   Now in this creed of Pope Pius, there are added, to the ancient creed
   of the Christian church, twelve or thirteen new articles; as concerning
   purgatory, transubstantiation, the worship of images, the invocation of
   saints, the communion in one kind, and that the church of Rome is the
   mother and mistress of all churches, and that there is no salvation to
   be had out of it, and several other points; all which have either no
   foundation in Scripture, or are plainly contrary to it, and none of
   them ever esteemed as articles of faith in the ancient Christian church
   for the first live hundred years; and yet they are now obtruded upon
   Christians, as of equal necessity to salvation, with the twelve
   articles of the Apostles Creed; and this under a pretence of
   infallibility, which St. Paul tells us would not have justified an
   apostle, or an angel from heaven, in making such additions to the
   Christian religion, and the imposing any thing as necessary to
   salvation, which is not so declared by the gospel of Christ.

   And all that they have to say for this, is, that we do not pretend to
   be infallible: but there is a necessity of an infallible judge to
   decide these controversies, and to him they are to be referred. Which
   is just as if, in a plain matter of right, a contentious and confident
   man should desire a reference, and contrive the matter so as to have it
   referred to himself, upon a sleeveless pretence, without any proof or
   evidence, that he is the only person in the world that hath authority
   and infallible skill to decide. all such differences. Thus the church
   of Rome would deal with us in things which are as plain as the
   noon-day; as, whether God hath forbidden the worship of images in the
   second commandment? whether our Saviour did institute the sacrament in
   both kinds? whether the people ought not to read the Scriptures, and to
   have the public service of God in a known tongue? these, and the like,
   they would have us refer to an infallible judge; and when we ask who he
   is, they tell us that their church, which hath imposed these things
   upon Christians, and made these additions to the gospel of Christ, is
   that infallible judge. But if she were as infallible, as she pretends
   to be, even as an apostle, or an angel from heaven, St. Paul hath
   denounced an anathema against her for preaching another gospel, and
   making those things necessary to the salvation of men which are not
   contained in the gospel of Christ.

   The inference from all this discourse, in short, is this; that we
   should "contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints,
   "and not suffer ourselves, by the confident pretences of seducers, to
   be removed from him that hath called us through the grace of Christ
   unto another gospel. The necessary doctrines of the Christian religion,
   and the common terms of salvation, are so plain, that if any man be
   ignorant of them it is his own fault; and if any go about to impose
   upon us any thing as of necessity to be believed and practised in order
   to salvation, which is not declared to be so in the Holy Scriptures,
   which contain the true doctrine of the gospel, what authority soever
   they pretend for it, yea, though they assume to themselves to be
   infallible; the apostle hath plainly told us what we are to think of
   them; for he hath put the case as high as is possible here in the text,
   when he says, "though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
   gospel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be
   accursed."

   I will conclude all with that counsel which the Spirit of God gives to
   the churches of Asia: (Rev. iii. 3.) "Remember therefore how thou hast
   received and heard, and hold fast;" and, (chap. ii. 10.) "Fear none of
   those things which thou shalt suffer: be thou faithful unto the death,
   and I will give thee a crown of life."

SERMON LXXXVI.

  HONESTY THE BEST PRESERVATIVE AGAINST DANGEROUS MISTAKES IN RELIGION.

   If any man do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
   God, or whether I speak of myself.--John vii. 17.

   SINCE there are so many different opinions and apprehensions in the
   world about matters of religion, and every sect and party does with so
   much confidence pretend, that they, and they only, are in the truth;
   the great difficulty and question is, by what means men may be secured
   from dangerous errors and mistakes in religion. For this end, some have
   thought it necessary that there should be an infallible church, in the
   communion whereof every man may be secured from the dangers of a wrong
   belief. But it seems God hath not thought this necessary; if he had, he
   would have revealed this very thing more plainly than any particular
   point of faith what soever. He would have told us expressly, and in the
   plainest terms, that he had appointed an infallible guide and judge in
   matters of faith, and would likewise have told us as plainly who he
   was, and where we might find him, and have recourse to him upon all
   occasions; because the sincerity of our faith depending upon him, we
   could not be safe from mistake in particular points, without so plain
   and clear a revelation of this infallible judge, that there could be no
   mistake about him; nor could there be an end of any other controversies
   in religion, unless this infallible judge (both that there is one, and
   who he is) were out of controversy. But neither of these are so: it is
   not plain, from Scripture, that there is an infallible judge and guide
   in matters of faith; much less is it plain who he is: and therefore we
   may certainly conclude, that God hath not thought it necessary that
   there should be an infallible guide and judge in matters of faith;
   because he hath revealed no such thing to us: and that bishop, and that
   church, who only have arrogated infallibility to themselves, have given
   the greatest evidence in the world to the contrary; and have been
   detected and stand convinced in the greatest errors: and it is in vain
   for any man, or company of men, to pretend to infallibility, so long as
   the evidence that they are deceived is much greater and clearer than
   any proof they can produce for their infallibility.

   If then God hath not provided an infallible guide and judge in matters
   of faith, there is some other way whereby men may be secured against
   dangerous and damnable errors in religion, and whereby they may discern
   truth from imposture, and what doctrines are from God, and what not;
   and this our Saviour declares to us here in the text, namely, that an
   honest and sincere mind, and a hearty desire to do the will of God, is
   the best preservative against fatal errors and mistakes in matters of
   religion; ea'n tis the'le poiein. "If any man desire to do his will, he
   shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
   myself."

   There are two dangerous mistakes in religion: to reject any thing which
   really comes from God; and to receive and entertain any thing which
   comes front God, which doth not really come from him.

   First, To reject any thing which really comes from God. This mistake
   the Jews frequently fell into, when they rejected the true prophets
   which God from time to time sent to them, slighting their message, and
   persecuting their persons: but they miscarried most fatally and
   remarkably in their contempt of the true Messias, that great prophet
   whom they had so long expected, and whom God sent, at last, to bring
   salvation to them; but when he came, they knew him not, nor would
   receive him, but used him with all the despite and contempt imaginable,
   not as a teacher come from God, but as a deceiver and imposter.

   Now the danger of rejecting any thing that comes from God consists in
   this, that it cannot be done without the highest affront to the Divine
   Majesty. To reject a Divine message or revelation is to op pose God,
   and fight against him. So our Saviour tells the Jews, that in despising
   him, they despised him that sent him.

   Secondly, There is also another dangerous mistake, on the other hand,
   in entertaining any thing as a revelation from God, which is not really
   from him. And this likewise the Jews were frequently guilty of, in
   receiving the false prophets, which spake in the name of the Lord, when
   he had not sent them. And this is commonly the temper of those who
   reject the truth, greedily to swallow error and delusion. So our
   Saviour tells us of the Jews: (John v. 43.) "I am come in my Father's
   name, and ye receive me not; if another shall come in his own name, him
   ye will receive." This prediction of our Saviour's concerning the Jews
   was fully accomplished; for, after they had rejected him, who gave such
   abundant evidence that he was the true Messias and a teacher sent from
   God, they received others who really came in their own names, and ran
   after those who pretended to be the Messias, and were, in great
   numbers, destroyed with them. And this is very just with God, that
   those who receive not the truth in the love of it, should be given up
   to strong delusions, to believe lies.

   Now these being the two great dangerous mistakes in religion which men
   are liable to, my work at this time shall be to shew, how a sincere
   desire and endeavour to do the will of God, is a security to men
   against both those dangers; and it will appear to be so, upon these two
   accounts:

   I. Because he, who sincerely desires and endeavours to do the will of
   God, is hereby better qualified and disposed to make a right judgment
   of spiritual and Divine things.

   II. Because God's providence is more especially concerned to secure
   such persons from dangerous errors and mistakes in things which concern
   their eternal salvation. These shall be the two heads of my following
   discourse.

   First, Because he, who sincerely desires and endeavours to do the will
   of God, is hereby better qualified and disposed to make aright judgment
   of spiritual and Divine things, and that for these two reasons:

   1. Because such a person has a truer notion of God and Divine things.

   2. Because he is more impartial in his search and inquiry after truth.

   1. Because such a person hath a truer notion of God and Divine
   things.--No man is so likely to have clear and true apprehensions of
   God, as a good man, because he hath transcribed the Divine perfections
   in his own mind, and is himself in some measure and decree what God is.
   And for this reason it is, that the Scripture so often lays the
   foundation of all Divine knowledge in the practice of religion: (Job
   xxviii. 28.) "The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from
   evil, is understanding:" and, (Psal. cxi. 10.) "The fear of the Lord is
   the beginning of wisdom," that is, the principle and foundation of it;
   "a good understanding have all they that do his commandments:" whereas
   the vice and lusts of men darken their reason and distort their
   understandings, and fill the mind with gross and sensual apprehensions
   of things, and thereby render men unfit to discern those truths which
   are of a spiritual nature and tendency, and altogether indisposed to
   receive them. For though the vices of men be properly seated in their
   wills, and do not possess their understandings, yet they have a bad
   influence upon them; as fumes and vapours from the stomach are wont to
   affect the head.

   Nothing, indeed, is more natural to the mind and understanding of men,
   than the knowledge of God; but we may abuse our faculties, and render
   them unfit for the discerning even of their proper objects.

   When men, by wicked practices, have rendered themselves unlike to God,
   they will not love to retain the knowledge of him in their minds, but
   will become vain in their imaginations concerning him. What clouds and
   mists are to the bodily eye, that the lusts and corruptions of men are
   to the understanding: they hinder it from a clear perception of
   heavenly things; the pure in heart, they are best qualified for the
   sight of God.

   Now, according as a man's notions of God are, such will be his
   apprehensions of religion. All religion is cither natural, or revealed:
   natural religion consists in the belief of a God, and in right
   conceptions and apprehensions concerning him, and in a due reverence
   and observance of him, and in a ready and cheerful obedience to those
   laws which he hath imprinted upon our nature; and the sum of our
   obedience consists in our conformity to God, and an endeavour to be
   like him. For, supposing God to have made no external revelation of his
   mind to us, we have no other way to know his will, but by, considering
   his nature and our own; and, if so, then he that resembles God most is
   like to understand him best, because he finds those perfections in some
   measure in himself, which he contemplates in the Divine nature; and
   nothing gives a man so sure a notion of things as practice and
   experience. Every good man is, in some degree, partaker of a Divine
   nature, and feels that in himself which he conceives to be in God: so
   that this man does experience what others do but talk of; he sees the
   image of God in himself, and is able to discourse of him from an in
   ward sense and feeling of his excellency and perfections.

   And as for revealed religion, the only design of that is, to revive and
   improve the natural notions which we have of God, and all our
   reasonings about Divine revelation are necessarily gathered by our
   natural notions of religion: and therefore, he that sincerely
   endeavours to do the will of God, is not apt to be imposed upon by the
   vain and confident pretences of Divine revelation; but if any doctrine
   be proposed to him, which pretends to come from God, he measures it by
   those steady and sure notions which he hath of the Divine nature and
   perfections; and by those he will easily discern whether it be worthy
   of God or not, and likely to proceed from him: he will consider the
   nature and tendency of it, and whether it be (as the apostle expresses
   it) "a doctrine according to godliness;" such as is agree able to the
   Divine nature and perfections, and tends to make us like to God: if it
   be not, though an angel from heaven should bring it, he will not
   receive it: if it be, he will not reject it upon every idle pretence
   and frivolous exception that prejudiced and ill-minded men may make
   against it; but, after he is satisfied of the reasonableness and purity
   of the doctrine, he will accept of such evidence and confirmation of
   it, as is fit for God to give to his own revelations; and if the person
   that brings it hath an attestation of miracles (which is necessary in
   case it be a new doctrine), and if he carry on no earthly interest and
   design by it, but does by his life and actions make it evident that he
   aims at the glory of God and the good of men; in this case a good man,
   whose mind is free from passion and prejudice, will easily assent that
   this man's doctrine is of God, and that he does not speak of himself.
   This was the evidence which our Saviour offered to the Jews in
   vindication of himself and his doctrine: (John vii. 18.) "He that
   speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his
   glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in
   him;" as if he had said, hereby may you distinguish one that really
   comes from God from an impostor--if any man seek his own glory, you may
   conclude that God hath not sent him, but whatever he pretends that he
   speaks of himself; but he who, by his life, and the course of his
   actions, demonstrates that he seeks the honour of God, and not any
   interest and advantage of his own, the same is true, and there is no
   unrighteousness in him; that is, no falsehood or design to deceive (for
   so the word adiki'a does some times signify), you may conclude such an
   one to be no deceiver or impostor. And if any man sincerely desires and
   endeavours to do the will of God, he may, by such marks and characters
   as these, judge of any doctrine that pretends to be from God, whether
   it be so or not. This is the first reason; because he that sincerely
   desires and endeavours to do the will of God, hath the truest notion of
   God and of Divine things.

   2. Such a person is more impartial in his search and inquiry after
   truth, and therefore more likely to find it, and to discern it from
   error. He that hath an honest mind, and sincerely endeavours to do the
   will of God, is not apt to be swayed and biassed by any interest or
   lust: for his great interest is to please God, and he makes all his
   other interests and concernments to stoop and yield to that. But if a
   man be governed by any earthly interest or design, he will measure all
   things by that; and is not at liberty to entertain any thing that
   crosses it, and to judge equally of any doctrine that is opposite to
   his interest. This our Saviour gives for a reason, why the great
   rabbies and teachers among the Jews did not believe and embrace his
   doctrine: (John v. 44.) "How can ye believe, which receive honour one
   of another?" If men have any other design in religion than to please
   God, and to advance his honour and glory in the world, no wonder if
   they be apt to reject the most Divine truths; because these are
   calculated not to approve us to men, but to God.

   And as vain-glory, and a desire of the applause of men, so likewise
   doth every other lust make a man partial in his judgment of things, and
   clap a false bias upon his understanding, which carries it off from
   truth, and makes it to lean towards that side of the question which is
   most favourable to the interest of his lusts. A vicious man is not
   willing to entertain those truths which would cross and check him in
   his course: he hath made the truth his enemy, and therefore he thinks
   himself concerned to oppose it, and rise up against it: the light of it
   offends him, and therefore he shuts his eyes that he may not see it.
   Those holy and pure doctrines, which are from God, reprove the lusts of
   men, and discover the deformity of them; and therefore no wonder if bad
   men be so hard to be reconciled to them. This account our Saviour
   likewise gives of the fierce enmity of the Jews to him, and his
   doctrine: (John iii. 19, 20.) "Light is come into the world, and men
   loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil; for
   every one that hath done evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
   light, lest his deeds should be reproved."

   The vicious inclinations of men are a dead weight upon their
   understandings, and able to draw down the scales against the clearest
   truths: for though it be absolutely in no man's power to believe, or to
   disbelieve what he will, yet men's lives have many times a great
   influence upon their understandings, to make assent easy or difficult;
   and as we are forward to believe what we have a mind to, so are we very
   backward and slow in yielding our assent to any thing that crosseth our
   inclinations. Men that allow themselves in ungodliness and worldly
   lusts, will not easily believe those doctrines which charge men so
   strictly with all manner of holiness and purity.

   This is the way which the devil hath always used to "blind the eyes of
   men, that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ might not shine
   into them." And certainly the most effectual way to keep men in
   infidelity is to debauch them in their lives; therefore the apostle
   gives this as the reason of the infidelity of men in the last times: (2
   Thess. ii. 12.) "They believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
   unrighteousness." When men once abandon themselves to lewd and vicious
   practices, infidelity be comes their interest, because they have no
   other way to defend and excuse a wicked life, but by denying the truth
   which opposeth it and finds fault with it.

   That man only stands fair for the entertainment of truth, who is under
   the dominion of no vice or lust; because he hath nothing to corrupt or
   bribe him, to seduce him, or draw him aside in his inquiry after truth;
   he hath no interest but to find the truth, and follow it; he is
   inquiring after the way to heaven and eternal happiness, and he hath
   the indifferency of a traveller which is not inclined to go this way
   rather than another; for his concernment is to find out the right way,
   and to walk in it: such an indifferency of mind hath every good man,
   who sincerely desires to do the will of God; he stands ready to receive
   truth, when sufficient evidence is offered to convince him of it;
   because he hath no manner of concernment that the contrary proposition
   should be true. As in mathematics, a man is ready to give his assent to
   any proposition that is sufficiently demonstrated to him, because he
   hath no inclination or affection to one side of the question more than
   to the other; all his design and concernment is to find out the truth
   on which side soever it lies; and he is like to find it, because he is
   so indifferent and impartial. But if a man be biassed by any lust, and
   addicted to any vicious practice, he is then an interested person, and
   concerned to be partial in his judgment of things, and is under a great
   temptation to infidelity when the truths of God are proposed to him;
   because, whatever the evidence for them he, he cannot but be unwilling
   to own the truth of that doctrine which is so contrary to his
   inclination and interest. If the affections and interests of men were
   as deeply concerned, and as sensibly touched, in the truth of
   mathematical propositions, as they are in the principles of morality
   and religion, we should find, that, when a proposition stood in their
   way and lay cross to their interest, though it were never so clearly
   demonstrated, yet they would raise a dust about it, and make a thousand
   cavils, and fence even against the evidence of a demonstration; they
   would palliate their error with all the skill and art they could; and,
   though the absurdity of it was never so great and palpable, yet they
   would hold it fast against all sense and reason, and face down mankind
   in the obstinate defence of it; for we have no reason to doubt, but
   that they, who in matters of religion will believe directly contrary to
   what they see, would, if they had the same interests and passions to
   sway them in the case, believe contrary to the clearest mathematical
   demonstration; for where there is an obstinate resolution not to be
   convinced, all the reason and evidence in the world signifies nothing.

   Whereas he that is biassed by no passion or interest, but hath an
   honest mind, and is sincerely desirous to do the will of God, so far as
   he knows it, is likely to judge very impartially concerning any
   doctrines that are proposed to him: for, if there be not good evidence
   that they are from God, he hath no reason to deceive himself in giving
   credit to them; and if there be good evidence that they are Divine, he
   hath no interest or inclination to reject them; for it being his great
   design to do the will of God, he is glad of all opportunities to come
   to the knowledge of it that he may do it.

   Thus you see how a sincere desire and endeavour to obey the will of God
   does secure men against fatal errors and mistakes in matters of
   religion; because such persons are hereby better disposed to make a
   right judgment of Divine things, both because they have truer and surer
   notions of God and religion, and are more impartial in their search and
   inquiry after truth. This is the first account.

   II. Another reason why they, who sincerely desire to do the will of
   God, have a great security in discerning truth from error, is, because
   the providence of God is more especially concerned to preserve such
   persons from dangerous errors and mistakes in things which concern
   their eternal salvation. When men are of a teachable temper, God loves
   to reveal himself and his truth to them; and such is an humble and
   obedient frame of mind: (Psal. xxv. 9.) "The meek will he guide in
   judgment; the meek will he teach his way." The proper disposition of a
   scholar is to be willing to learn; and that which in religion we are to
   learn is, "what is the good and acceptable will of God," that we may do
   it, for practice is the end of knowledge. "If you know these things
   (says our blessed Lord), happy are ye if ye do them." It is necessary
   to know the will of God; but we are happy only in the doing of it: and
   if any man be desirous to do the will of God, his goodness is such,
   that he will take effectual care to secure such an one against
   dangerous and fatal errors. he that hath an honest mind, and would do
   the will of God if he knew it, God will not suffer him to remain
   ignorant of it, or to be mistaken about it, in any necessary points of
   faith and practice.

   St. Paul is a wonderful instance of the goodness of God in this kind.
   He was undoubtedly a man of a very honest mind; he had entertained the
   Jewish religion, as revealed by God, and been bred in it; and out of a
   blind reverence and belief of his teachers, who rejected Christ and his
   doctrine, he likewise opposed and persecuted them with a mighty zeal
   and an honest intention, being verily persuaded (as he himself tells
   us), that he ought to do what he did against the name of Jesus of
   Nazareth; he was under a great prejudice upon account of his education,
   and, according to the heat of his natural temper, transported with
   great passion: but because he did what he did ignorantly and in
   unbelief, God was pleased to shew mercy to him, and, in a miraculous
   manner, to convince him of the truth of that religion which he
   persecuted. He was sincerely desirous to do the will of God, and
   therefore God would rather work a miracle for his conversion, than
   suffer him to go on in so fatal a mistake concerning the Christian
   religion.

   And as the providence of God doth concern itself to secure good men
   from dangerous errors and mistakes in matters of religion; so by a just
   judgment he gives up those, who allow themselves in vicious practices,
   to error and infidelity. And this is the meaning of that passage of the
   prophet, (Isa. vi. 10.) so often cited by our Saviour, and applied to
   the Jews, of "making the heart of that people fat, and their ears
   heavy, and closing their ryes, lest they should understand and be
   converted." So again, (Isa. lxvi. 3, 4.) God threatens the people of
   Israel, that, because they were wicked and abominable in their lives,
   he would abandon them, and give them over to a spirit of delusion;
   "they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their
   abominations; I also will choose their delusions." God is said to
   choose those things for us, which he permits us to fall into: so (Rom.
   i. 28.) God is said to give over the abominable heathen to a reprobate
   mind. "As they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave
   them over, eis adokimon noun, to an injudicious and undiscerning mind."
   When men abandon themselves to wickedness and impiety, God withdraws
   his grace from them; and, by his secret and just judgment, they are
   deprived of the faculty of discerning between truth and error, between
   good and evil. 2 Thess. ii. 10, 11, 12, it is said, that "the man of
   sin should come with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that
   perish, because they received not the love of the truth, that they
   might be saved:" and that "for this cause God would send them strong
   delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned
   who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." And
   it is just with God, that men of vicious inclinations and practices
   should be exposed to the cheat of the grossest and vilest impostors.
   God's providence is concerned for men of honest minds, and sincere
   intentions: but if men take pleasure in unrighteousness, God takes no
   further care of them, but delivers them up to their own hearts lusts,
   to be seduced into all those errors into which their own vain
   imaginations, and their foolish hearts, are apt to lead them.

   Thus have I endeavoured, as briefly as I could, to shew, that an honest
   mind, that sincerely desires and endeavours to do the will of God, is
   the best security against fatal errors and mistakes in matters of
   religion; both because it disposeth a man to make a true judgment of
   Divine things, and because the providence of God is more especially
   concerned for the security of such persons.

   There remains an objection to be answered, to which this discourse may
   seem liable; but this, together with the inferences which may be made
   from this discourse, I shall refer to another opportunity.

SERMON LXXXVII.

  HONESTY THE BEST PRESERVATIVE AGAINST DANGEROUS MISTAKES IN RELIGION.

   If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it
   be of God, or whether I speak of myself.--John vii. 17.

   I MADE entrance into these words the last day; in which our Saviour
   declares to us, that an honest and sincere mind, and a hearty desire
   and endeavour to do the will of God, is the best security and
   preservative against dangerous errors and mistakes in matters of
   religion; ean tis thele poiein, "If any man desire to do his will, he
   shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
   myself."

   Now there are (I told you) two great mistakes in religion: to reject
   any thing which really is from God; and to receive and entertain any
   thing as from God, which is not really from him. And therefore, I
   proposed, from this text, to shew how a sincere desire and endeavour to
   do the will of God, is a security to men against both these dangers;
   namely, upon these two accounts.

   First, Because he, who sincerely desires and endeavours to do the will
   of God, is hereby better qualified and disposed to make a right
   judgment of spiritual and Divine things; and that for these two
   reasons.

   I. Because such a person hath a truer notion of God and Divine things.
   He that resembleth God most is like to understand him best, because he
   finds those perfections, in some measure, in himself, which he
   contemplates in the Divine nature; and nothing gives a man so sure a
   notion of things as practice and experience.

   II. Because such a person is more impartial in his search and inquiry
   after truth, and, therefore, more likely to find it, and to discern it
   from error. That man only stands fair for the entertainment of truth,
   who is under the power and dominion of no vice or lust, because he hath
   nothing to corrupt or bribe him, to seduce him and draw him aside in
   his inquiry after truth: he hath no manner of concernment that the
   contrary proposition should be true, having the indifferency of a
   traveller, and no other interest but to find out the right way to
   heaven, and to walk in it. But if a man be biassed by any lust, and
   addicted to any vicious practice, he is then an interested person, and
   concerned to make a partial judgment of things, and is under a great
   temptation to infidelity when the truths of God are proposed to him;
   because, whatever the evidence for them be, he cannot but be unwilling
   to own the truth of those doctrines which are so contrary to his
   inclination and interest.

   Secondly, Another reason why they, who sincerely desire to do the will
   of God, have a greater security in discerning truth from error, is,
   because the providence of God is more especially concerned to preserve
   such persons from dangerous errors and mistakes, in things which
   concern their eternal salvation. When men are of a teachable temper, of
   a humble and obedient frame of mind, God loves to reveal himself and
   his truth to them; (Psal. xxv. 9.) "The meek will he guide in judgment,
   and the meek will he teach his way." The proper disposition of a
   scholar is to be willing to learn; and that which in religion we are to
   learn, is, "what is the good and acceptable will of God, that we may do
   it;" for practice is the end of knowledge: "If ye know these things
   (saith our Saviour) happy are ye if ye do them." It is necessary to
   know the will of God, but we are only happy in the doing of it; and if
   any man be desirous to do the will of God, his goodness is such that he
   will take effectual care to secure such an one against dangerous and
   fatal errors. He that hath an honest mind, and would do the will of God
   if he knew it, God will not suffer him to remain ignorant of it, or to
   be mistaken about it in any necessary point of faith or practice. Thus
   far I have gone.

   I shall now proceed to remove an objection, to which this discourse may
   seem liable, and then draw some inferences from the whole.

   After all that hath been said, some, perhaps, may ask, Is every good
   man secure from all error and mistake in matters of religion? This is a
   mighty privilege indeed: but do not we find the contrary in experience?
   that an honest heart and a weak head do often meet together?

   For answer to this, I shall lay down these following propositions:

   First, That if there were any necessity that a good man should be
   secured from all manner of error and mistake in religion, this probity
   of mind, and sincere desire to do the will of God, is the best way to
   do it; because such a temper and disposition of mind gives a man the
   best advantages to discern betwixt truth and error, and God is most
   likely to reveal his will to such persons. But there is no necessity of
   this, because a man may be a good man, and go to heaven,
   notwithstanding a great many mistakes in religion about things not
   necessary. For while we are in this imperfect state, "we know but in
   part," and see many things very imperfectly: but when we shall come
   into a more perfect state, "that which is imperfect shall be done
   away;" the light of glory shall scatter all those mists and clouds
   which are now upon our understandings, and hinder us from a clear sight
   and judgment of things: we shall then see God, and other things, as
   they are; and be freed from all that ignorance, and those many childish
   mistakes, which we are liable to here below; and till then, it is not
   necessary that we should be secured from them. Humility, under a sense
   of our ignorance, is better for us than infallibility would be.

   Secondly, This temper and disposition of mind which I have been
   speaking of, is a certain security against fatal mistakes in religion,
   and a final continuance in such errors as would prove damnable; and
   this is all that this discourse pretends to, or our Saviour hath
   promised in this text. And considering the goodness of God, nothing is
   more improbable, than that an honest mind that seeks impartially after
   truth should miss of it, in things that are fundamentally necessary to
   salvation. And if we could suppose such a man to fall into such an
   error, either it would not be fundamental to him, having not been,
   perhaps, proposed to him with sufficient evidence, and would be
   forgiven him upon a general repentance for all sins and errors known or
   unknown, or he would not be permitted to continue in it; but the
   providence of God would find out some way or other to convince him of
   his error, and to bring him to the acknowledgment of the truth, that he
   might be saved. God would rather speak to him immediately from heaven
   (as he did to St. Paul), than suffer him to continue in such an error
   as would infallibly carry him to hell.

   Thirdly, There is no such depth of judgment and subtilty of wit
   required, to discern between gross and damnable errors in religion, and
   necessary and saving truth, but that an ordinary capacity may be able
   to do it. There is so plain a line drawn between great truth and gross
   errors, that it is visible to every capacity; and an ordinary
   understanding, that is not under a violent prejudice, or blinded by
   some vice or fault of the will, may easily discern it. Indeed, in
   matters of lesser moment or concernment, and which have no such
   considerable and immediate influence upon the practice of a holy life,
   the difference betwixt truth and error is not always so gross and
   sensible as to be obvious to every unprejudiced eye. But we have all
   the reason in the world to believe, that the goodness and justice of
   God is such, as to make nothing necessary to be believed by any man,
   which, by the help of due instruction, may not be made sufficiently
   plain to a common understanding. God hath so tender a care of good men,
   who sincerely love him and his truth, that we may reasonably presume,
   that he will not leave them under an unavoidable mistake concerning
   those matters upon which their eternal salvation does depend. The Judge
   of all the world will do right; and then we may certainly conclude,
   that he will not condemn any man for no fault, and make him for ever
   miserable, for falling into an error, which, with all his care and
   diligence, he could not possibly either discern or avoid.

   Fourthly, God hath made abundant provision for our security from fatal
   and dangerous errors in religion, by these three ways:

   I. By an infallible rule, sufficiently plain in all things necessary.

   II. By sufficient means of instruction to help us to understand this
   rule.

   III. By an infallible promise of security from dangerous errors and
   mistakes, if, with an honest mind and due diligence, we apply ourselves
   to understand this rule, and make use of the means of instruction which
   God hath provided for that purpose.

   I. God hath given us an infallible rule, sufficiently plain in all
   things necessary. He hath given ns the Holy Scriptures, which were
   given at first by Divine inspiration; i. e. by men infallibly assisted
   in the writing of them, and therefore must needs be an infallible rule;
   and all Scripture divinely inspired, "is profitable for doctrine, for
   reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness," as St. Paul
   tells us, 2 Tim. iii. 16. speaking there of the books of the Old
   Testament; and there is the same reason as to the inspired writings of
   the New.

   Now, if the Scriptures be an infallible rule, and "profitable for
   doctrine and instruction in righteousness;" i. e. to teach us to
   believe and do; it follows of necessity that they are sufficiently
   plain in all things necessary to faith and a good life, other wise they
   could not be useful "for doctrine and instruction in righteousness;"
   for a rule that is not plain to us in these things, in which it is
   necessary for us to be directed by it, is of no use to us; that is, in
   truth, it is no rule. For a rule must have these two properties; it
   must be perfect, and it must be plain. The Scriptures are a perfect
   rule, because the writers of them, being Divinely inspired, were
   infallible. And they must likewise be plain; other wise, though they be
   never so perfect, they can be of no more use to direct our faith and
   practice, than a sun-dial in a dark room is to tell us the hour of the
   day; for though it be never so exactly made, unless the sun shine
   clearly upon it, we had as good be without it. A rule that is not plain
   to us, what ever it may be in itself, is of no use at all to us, till
   it be made plain and we understand it.

   II. God hath likewise provided sufficient means of instruction to help
   us to understand this rule. It is not necessary that a rule should be
   so plain that we should perfectly understand it at first sight; it is
   sufficient, if it be so plain that those of better capacity and
   understanding may, with due diligence and application of mind, come to
   the true knowledge of it, and those of a lower and more ordinary
   capacity by the help and instruction of a teacher. Euclid's "Elements"
   is a book sufficiently plain to teach a man geometry; but yet not so
   plain that any man at first reading should understand it perfectly; but
   that, by diligent reading, by a due application, and steady attention
   of mind, a man of extraordinary sagacity and understanding may come to
   understand the principles and demonstrations of it; and those of a more
   ordinary capacity, with the help of a teacher, may come to the
   knowledge of it. So, when we say that the Scriptures are plain, in all
   things necessary to faith and a good life, we do not mean that every
   man, at first hearing or reading of these things in it, shall perfectly
   understand them; but, by diligent reading and consideration, if he be
   of good apprehension and capacity, he may come to a sufficient
   knowledge of them; and if he be of a meaner capacity, and he willing to
   learn, he may, by the help of a teacher, be brought to under hand them
   without any great pains; and such teachers God hath appointed in his
   church for this very purpose, and a succession of them to continue to
   the end of the world.

   In a word, when we say the Scriptures are plain to all capacities, in
   all things necessary, we mean, that any man of ordinary capacity, by
   his own diligence and care, in conjunction with the helps and
   advantages which God hath appointed, and in the due use of them, may
   attain to the knowledge of every thing necessary to his salvation; and
   that there is no book in the world more plain, and better fitted to
   teach a man any art or science, than the Bible is, to direct and
   instruct men in the way to heaven; and it is every man's fault if he be
   ignorant of any thing necessary for him to believe, or do, in order to
   his eternal happiness.

   III. Good men are likewise secured from fatal errors in religion, by
   the infallible promise of God, if so be that, with honest minds and due
   diligence, they apply themselves to the understanding of this rule, and
   make use of the means of instruction which God hath provided for that
   purpose. God hath promised to guide and "teach the humble and meek;"
   that is, such as are of a submissive and teachable temper, desirous and
   diligent to be instructed in the truth. (Prov. ii. 2, 3, 4, 5.) "If
   thou incline thine ear to wisdom, and apply thine heart to
   understanding; if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice
   for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her
   as for hid treasures, then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord,
   and find the knowledge of God." And here, in the text, our Saviour
   assures us, that if any man be desirous to do his will, "he shall know
   of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether he spake of himself;"
   i. e. he shall be able to discern the doctrines which are from God.

   This is the provision which God hath made for our security from fatal
   mistakes in religion; and this is, in all respects, a better security,
   and more likely to guide and conduct us safely to heaven, than any
   infallible church; and that for these reasons.

   First, Because it is much more certain that God hath made this
   provision which I have mentioned, than that there is an infallible
   church appointed and assisted by him to this purpose. That the
   Scriptures are an infallible and adequate rule, and sufficiently plain
   in all things necessary, I have already proved; and I add further, that
   this was the constant judgment of the ancient church, and so declared
   by the unanimous consent of the fathers of it for many ages; and that
   all councils, in their determinations of faith, proceeded upon this
   rule, till the second council of Nice.

   I have likewise proved, that God hath provided a succession of pastors
   and teachers in his church, to instruct us in this rule; and that we
   have God's infallible promise for our security from dangerous errors
   and mistakes, if, with an honest mind and due diligence, we apply
   ourselves to understand this rule, and make use of the means of
   instruction which God hath provided for that purpose.

   But that there is an infallible church, appointed and assisted by God,
   to declare and determine matters of faith, and to be an infallible
   interpreter of Scripture, is not certain; because there is no clear and
   express text of Scripture to that purpose, that any church whatsoever,
   much less that the church of Rome, hath this power and privilege.

   Nay, I add further, that it is impossible, according to the principles
   of the church of Rome, that this should be proved from Scripture;
   because, according to their principles, we cannot know either which are
   the true books of Scripture, or what is the true sense of Scripture,
   but from the authority and infallible declaration of that church. And
   if so, then the infallibility of the church must be first known and
   proved, before we can either know the Scriptures or the sense of them;
   and yet till we know the Scriptures, and the sense of them, nothing can
   be proved by them. Now, to pretend to prove the infallibility of their
   church by Scripture, and at the same time to declare, that which are
   the true books of Scripture, and what is the true sense of them, can
   only be proved by the infallible authority of their church, is a plain
   and shameful circle, out of which there is no way of escape; and,
   consequently, that God hath appointed an infallible church is
   impossible, according to their principles, ever to be proved from
   Scripture, and the thing is capable of no other proof. For that God
   will infallibly assist any society of men, is not to be known, but by
   Divine revelation. So that, unless they can prove it by some other
   revelation than that of Scripture (which they do not pretend to), the
   thing is not to be proved at all. Yes, they say, by the notes and marks
   of the true church; but what those marks are must either be known from
   Scripture, or some other Divine revelation, and then the same
   difficulty returns: besides that, one of the most essential marks of
   the true church must be the profession of the true faith; and then it
   must first he known which is the true faith, before we can know which
   is the true church; and yet they say, that no man can learn the true
   faith but from the true church; and this runs them unavoidably into
   another circle as shameful as the other. So that which way soever they
   go to prove an infallible church, they are shut up in a plain circle,
   and must either prove the Scriptures by the church, and the church by
   the Scriptures; or the true church by the true faith, and the true
   faith by the true church.

   Secondly, This provision and security which I have mentioned is more
   human, better accommodated and suited to the nature of man; because k
   doth not suppose and need a standing and perpetual miracle, as the
   other way of an infallible church doth. All inspiration is supernatural
   and miraculous; and this infallible assistance which the church of Rome
   claims to herself, must either be such as the apostles had, which was
   by immediate inspiration, or something equal to it, and alike
   supernatural: but God does not work miracles without need, or continue
   them when there is no occasion for them. When God delivered the law to
   the people of Israel, it was accompanied with miracles, and the
   prophets, which he sent to them from time to time, had an immediate
   inspiration; but their supreme judicature, or their general council,
   which they call the Sanhedrin, was not infallibly assisted in the
   expounding of the law, when doubts and difficulties arose about it; no,
   nor in judging of true and false prophets; but they determined this,
   and all other emergent cases, by the standing revelation and rule of
   their written law; and that they were not infallibly assisted, is
   evident from the great errors they fell into, in "making void the
   commandments of God by their tradition," and in their rejecting and
   crucifying the true Messias and the Son of God.

   In like manner the apostles and first teachers of the Christian
   religion were immediately inspired and assisted in the publishing of
   the Christian doctrine, and for the speedy and more effectual
   propagating and planting of it in the world, in despite of the violent
   prejudices that were against it, and the fierce opposition that was
   made to it. But when this was done, this miraculous and extraordinary
   assistance ceased, and God left the Christian religion to be preserved
   and continued by more human and ordinary ways; the doctrines of it
   being committed to writing, for a standing rule of faith and practice
   in all ages, and an order of men appointed to instruct people in those
   doctrines, with a promise to secure both teachers and people, that
   sincerely desire to know and do the will of God, from all fatal errors
   and mistakes about things necessary to their eternal salvation; and
   this is a provision more likely to be made by God, and better suited to
   the nature of man, than the perpetual and needless miracle of an
   inspired, or any otherwise infallible church.

   Thirdly, This way is likewise more agreeable to the nature of religion
   and the virtue of faith. The design of an infallible church is to
   secure all that continue in the communion of it, against all
   possibility of error in matters of faith. The question now is not,
   whether an infallible church would do this? but whether that church
   which arrogates infallibility to itself does not pretend to do this?
   And if they could do it, it would not be agreeable to the nature of
   religion and the virtue of faith. For faith, which is the principle of
   all religious actions, would be no virtue, if it were necessary. A true
   and right belief can be no virtue, where a man is infallibly secured
   against error. There is the same reason of virtuous and criminal
   actions; and as there can be no crime or fault in doing what a man
   cannot help, so neither can there be any virtue. All virtuous actions
   are matter of praise and commendation; and therefore it can be no
   virtue in any man, because it deserves no commendation, to believe and
   own that the sun shines at noon-day when he sees it does so. No more
   would it be a virtue in any man, and deserve praise, to believe aright,
   who is in a church wherein he is infallibly secured against all errors
   in matters of faith. Make any thing necessary, and impossible to be
   otherwise, and the doing of it ceases to be a virtue. God hath so
   framed religion, that the evidence of truth, and the means of coining
   to the knowledge of it, as to be a sufficient security to men of honest
   minds and teachable tempers against all fatal and final mistakes
   concerning things necessary to salvation; but not so, that every man
   that is of such a church should be infallibly secured against all
   errors in matters of faith; and this on purpose to try the virtue and
   disposition of men, whether they will be at the pains to search for
   truth, and when it is proposed to them with sufficient evidence, though
   not by an infallible hand, they will receive it in the love of it, that
   they may be saved.

   Fourthly, This is as much security against errors in matters of faith,
   as God hath provided against sin and vice in matters of practice; and,
   since a right belief is only in order to a good life, a man would be
   hard put to it, to give a wise reason why God should take greater care
   for the infallible security of men's faith than of their obedience. The
   reason pretended why God should make such infallible provision for a
   right faith, is, for the better security of men's eternal salvation and
   happiness. Now the virtues of a good life have a more direct and
   immediate influence upon that than the most orthodox belief. The end of
   the commandment (i. e. of the declaration of the gospel) is charity. In
   the Christian religion, that which mainly avails to our justification
   and salvation is, "a faith that worketh by charity," and the keeping of
   the commandments of God. "He that heareth these sayings of mine and
   doth them (saith our blessed Lord), I will liken him to a wise man that
   built his house upon a rock;" and again, "not every one that saith unto
   me, Lord, Lord, (i. e. makes profession of faith in me) shall enter
   into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father
   which is in heaven;" and again, "if ye know these things, happy are ye,
   if ye do them." And the apostle St. Peter exhorts Christians to "add to
   their faith knowledge, and virtue, and godliness, and brotherly
   kindness, and charity, that so an abundant entrance may be ministered
   to them, into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ." So that the virtues of a good life have the greatest influence
   upon our salvation, and the main stress of Christianity is to be laid
   there. And, therefore, whatever reason can be as signed why God should
   provide for the infallible security of our faith, is much stronger why
   an equal provision should be made to secure holiness and obedience of
   life; because, without this, faith cannot infallibly attain its end,
   which is the salvation of our souls. But this, it is granted, God hath
   not done, and experience shews it; and therefore it is unreasonable to
   suppose that he hath done the other. It is sufficient that, in both
   kinds, he hath done that which is sufficient to make us capable of
   happiness, if we be not wanting to ourselves; the rest he hath left to
   the sincerity of our endeavours; expecting we, on our part, "should
   work out our salvation with fear and trembling, and give all diligence
   to make our calling and election sure." And if God hath made such
   provision by the gospel for all that enjoy the light and advantage of
   it, that none can miscarry without their own fault, then both his
   goodness and wisdom are sufficiently acquitted, without an infallible
   guide and judge in matters of faith; and that irreverent way of arguing
   in the canon law might well have been spared--that of necessity there
   must be an infallible judge of controversies in religion; aliter
   dominus non videretur fuisse discretus, "otherwise God would not seem
   to have ordered matters discreetly,"

   But what infallible security soever they have, in the church of Rome,
   as to matters of faith, they are certainly the worst provided, of
   wholesome and safe directions for the consciences and lives of men, of
   any church in the world. No religion, that I know of in the world, ever
   had such lewd and scandalous casuists. Witness the moral divinity of
   the Jesuits, which hath been so exposed to the world, not only by those
   of our religion, but by their own writers also. Nor is this mischief
   only confined to that order; their casuists in general, and even the
   more ancient of them, who writ before the order of Jesuits appeared in
   the world, have given such a liberty and loose to great immorality in
   several kinds, as is infinitely to the reproach of the best and purest
   religion in the world. Insomuch that Sir Thomas More himself, who was a
   great zealot for that religion, could not forbear to make a loud
   complaint of it, and to pass this severe censure upon the generality of
   their casuists: "That their great business seemed to be, not to keep
   men from sin, but to teach them quam prope ad peccatum liceat accedere
   sine peccato: how near to sin they might lawfully come without
   sinning." In the mean time the consciences of men are not like to be
   well directed, when, instead of giving men plain rules for government
   of their hearts and lives, and clear resolutions of the material doubts
   which frequently occur in human life, they entangle them in niceties
   and endless scrupulosities, teaching them to split hairs in divinity,
   and how, with great art and cunning, they may avoid the committing of
   any sin, and yet come as near to it as possible. This is a thing of a
   most dangerous consequence to the souls of men; and if men be but once
   encouraged to pass to the utmost bounds of what is lawful, the next
   step will be into that which is unlawful.

   So that unless faith without works will save men, notwithstanding the
   infallible security which they pretend to give men of a sound and right
   belief (if it were really as much as they talk of), the salvation of
   men would still be in great hazard and uncertainty, for want of better
   and safer directions for a good life, than are ordinarily to be met
   with in the casuistical writings of that church; especially if we
   consider that the Scriptures are locked up from the people in an
   unknown tongue, where the surest and plainest directions for a good
   life are most plentifully to be had; insomuch, that a man had better
   want all the volumes of casuistical dignity, that ever were written in
   the world, than to be without the Bible; by the diligent studying of
   which book alone, he may sooner learn the way to heaven than by all the
   books in the world without it.

   Fifthly and lastly, This provision which God hath made, is, when all is
   done, as good a security against fatal errors and mistakes in religion,
   as an infallible church could give, if there were one; and it is as
   good a way to prevent and put an end to controversies in religion, so
   far as it is necessary that they should be prevented, and have an end
   put to them. And these are the two great reasons why an infallible
   judge is so importunately demanded and insisted upon. I shall speak to
   these distinctly and severally; but, because they will require a longer
   discourse than the time will allow, I shall not enter upon them at
   present, but refer them to another opportunity.

SERMON LXXXVIII.

  HONESTY THE BEST PRESERVATIVE AGAINST DANGEROUS MISTAKES IN RELIG1ON.

   If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it
   be of God, or whether I speak of myself.--John vii. 17.

   WHEN I made entrance into these words, I proposed from this text:--

   First, To shew that an honest and sincere mind, and a hearty desire and
   endeavour to do the will of God, is the greatest security and best
   preservative against dangerous errors and mistakes in matters of
   religion.

   In the next place, I proceeded to remove an objection to which my
   discourse upon this subject might seem liable. Some, perhaps, might
   ask, Is every good man then secure from all error and mistake in
   matters of religion? This is a mighty privilege indeed. But do we not
   find the contrary in experience, that an honest heart and a weak head
   do often meet together? For answer to this, I laid down several
   propositions.

   By the last of which I shewed, that God hath made abundant provision
   for our security from fatal and dangerous errors in religion, both by
   the infallible rule of the Holy Scripture, and by sufficient means of
   instruction to help us to understand this rule, and by his infallible
   promise of assisting us, if, with honest minds and a due diligence, we
   apply ourselves to the understanding of this rule, and the use of these
   means. And this, I told you, was in all respects a better security, and
   more likely to conduct us safe to heaven, than any infallible church
   whatsoever; and that for five reasons, four of which I have already
   treated of, and now proceed to the fifth, and last, viz.

   Because this provision which I have shewn God hath made, is both as
   good a security against fatal errors and mistakes in religion, as an
   infallible church could give, if there were one: and it is likewise as
   good a way to prevent and put an end to controversies in religion, so
   far as it is necessary they should be prevented, or have an end put to
   them. And these are the two great reasons why an infallible judge is so
   importunately demanded and insisted upon. I shall speak to these two
   points distinctly and severally.

   First, Because this is as good a security against fatal errors and
   mistakes in religion, as an infallible church could give, if there were
   one. For an infallible church, if there were such an one upon earth,
   could not infallibly secure particular Christians against errors in
   faith any other way than by the definition and declaration of those who
   are infallible in that church. And there are but three that pretend to
   it: either the pope, or a general council, or the pope and a general
   council agreeing in the same definitions. Not the pope by himself, nor
   the general council without the pope; because the church, which
   pretends to infallibility, is not agreed that either of these alone is
   infallible, and therefore their definitions can be no certain, much
   less infallible, foundation of faith; no, not to that church which
   pretends to infallibility. So that, if there be an infallible oracle in
   that church, it must be the pope and council in conjunction, or the
   definition of a council confirmed by the pope. Now in that case, either
   the council was infallible in its definitions, before they had the
   pope's confirmation, or not. If the council was infallible in its
   definitions, before they had the pope's confirmation, then the council
   alone, and of itself, was infallible (which a great part of the church
   of Rome deny), and then it needed not the pope's confirmation to make
   it infallible: or else a general council is not infallible in its
   definitions before they receive the pope's confirmation, and then the
   pope's confirmation cannot make it so; for that, which was not
   infallibly defined by the council, cannot be made infallible by the
   pope's confirmation.

   But there is another difficulty yet: it is a maxim generally received,
   and that even in the Roman church, "That the definitions of a general
   council, confirmed by the pope, are not obligatory, unless they be
   received by the universal church;" from whence these two great
   inconveniences will unavoidably follow:--

   I. That no man is obliged to believe such definitions, till he
   certainly know that they are received by the universal church; which
   how he should certainly, much less infallibly, know, I cannot
   understand; unless he either speak with all the Christians in the
   world, or the representatives of all particular churches return back
   and meet again in council, to declare, that the universal church hath
   received their definitions; which, I think, was never yet done.

   II. It will follow, that the definitions of a general council,
   confirmed by the pope, are not infallible till they be received by the
   universal church; for if they were infallible without that, they would
   be obligatory without it; because an infallible definition, if we know
   it to be so, lays an obligation to believe it, whether it be received
   by the universal church or not. And if such definitions are not
   infallible till they be received by the universal church, they cannot
   become infallible afterwards; because, if the definitions were not
   infallible before, they cannot be received as such by the universal
   church, nor, by the mere reception of them, be made to be infallible
   definitions, if they were not so before.

   But if we should pass, over all these difficulties, there is a greater
   yet behind, and that is, supposing the definitions of general councils
   confirmed by the pope to be infallible, particular Christians cannot be
   secured infallibly from error without the knowledge of those
   definitions. And there are but two ways imaginable of conveying this
   knowledge to them: either by the living voice of their particular
   pastors, whom they are implicitly to believe in these matters; but
   particular pastors are fallible (as they themselves grant), and
   therefore their words can neither be an infallible foundation of faith,
   nor an infallible means of conveying it; and it is unreason able, they
   say, for men that own themselves to be fallible, to require an implicit
   belief to be given to them; or else the knowledge of the definitions of
   councils must be conveyed to particular Christians by writing; and if
   so, then there will only be an infallible rule, but no living
   infallible judge. And if an infallible rule will serve the turn, we
   have the Scriptures, which we are sure are infallible, and therefore at
   least as good as any other rule. But they say that the definitions of
   councils give us an infallible interpretation of Scripture, and
   therefore are of greater advantage to us. But do not the definitions of
   councils sometimes also need explication, that we may know the certain
   sense of them, with out which we cannot know the doctrines defined?
   Yes, certainly, they need explication as much as Scripture, if there be
   any difference about the meaning of them; and there have been, and
   still are, great differences among those of their own church about the
   meaning of them. And if the explications of general councils need
   themselves to be explained, then there is nothing got by them, and we
   are but where we were before: for differences about the meaning of the
   definitions of general councils, make as great difficulties and
   uncertainties in faith as the differences about the meaning of
   Scripture:

   Well, but the people have the living voice of their particular pastors
   to explain the definitions of councils to them. But this does not help
   the matter neither; for these two reasons.

   1. Because particular pastors have no authority to explain the
   definitions of general councils. The council of Trent hath, by express
   decree, reserved to the pope, and to him only, the power to explain the
   definitions of the council, if any difference arise about the meaning
   of them. So that, if there be any difference about the true sense and
   meaning of any of the definitions of the council, particular pastors
   have no authority to explain them; and where there is no doubt or
   difference about the meaning of them, there is no occasion for the
   explication of them.

   2. But suppose they had authority to explain them, this can be no
   infallible security to the people, that they explain them right; both
   because particular pastors are fallible; and likewise, because we see,
   in experience, that they differ in their explications; witness the
   bishop of Condom's exposition of the catholic faith, and of the
   definitions of the council of Trent, which is, in many material points,
   very different from that of Bellarmine, and many other famous doctors
   of that church. And, which is more, witness the many differences
   betwixt Ambrosius, Catharinus, and Dominicus à Soto, about the
   definitions of that council, in which they were both present and heard
   the debates, and themselves bore a great part in them. Now if they, who
   were present at the framing of the definitions of that council, cannot
   agree about the meaning of them, much less can it be expected from
   those that were absent.

   Secondly, This provision which I have mentioned, is likewise as good a
   way to prevent and put an end to controversies in religion, so far as
   it is necessary they should be prevented, or have an end put to them,
   as any infallible church would be, if there were one: and this is
   another reason why an infallible church is so much insisted upon, that
   there may be some way and means for a final decision of controversies,
   which the Scriptures cannot be, because they are only a dead rule,
   which can end no controversy without a living judge ready at hand, to
   interpret and apply that rule upon emergent occasions.

   It is not necessary that all controversies in religion should either be
   prevented or decided: this the church, which pretends to be infallible,
   cannot pretend to have done; because there are manifold controversies,
   even in the church of Rome herself, concerning matters of religion,
   which still remain undecided; and, in their commentaries upon
   Scripture, many differences about the sense of several texts concerning
   which she hath not thought fit to give an infallible interpretation.
   And where their popes, and several of their general councils, have
   thought fit to meddle with Scripture, they have applied and interpreted
   texts more improperly and absurdly than even their private doctors. And
   which is more, in differences about points of faith, which are
   pretended on both sides to be fundamental, this church hath not thought
   fit to put an end to them by her infallible decision, after two hundred
   years brandling about them. For instance, in that fierce and long
   difference about the immaculate conception of the blessed Virgin,
   which, on both sides, is pretended to be an article of faith, and for
   which contrary revelations of their canonized saints are so frequently
   pretended; and yet neither pope, nor general council, have thought fit
   to exert their infallibility for the decision of this controversy. So
   that if their church had this talent of infallibility ever committed to
   them, they have with the slothful servant laid it up in a napkin; and,
   according to our Saviour's rule, have long since forfeited it, for not
   making use of it.

   And whereas it is pretended that the Scripture is but a dead rule,
   which can end no controversies without a living judge ready at hand, to
   interpret and apply that rule upon emergent occasions; the same
   objection lies against them, unless a general council, which is their
   living judge, were always sit ting. For the definitions of their
   councils in writing are liable to the same and greater objections, than
   the written rule of the Scriptures.

   The sum of all is this. In differences about lesser matters, mutual
   charity and forbearance will secure the peace of the church, though the
   differences remain undecided; and in greater matters, an infallible
   rule searched into with an honest mind and due diligence, and with the
   help of good instruction, is more likely to extinguish and put an end
   to such differences than any infallible judge, if there were one;
   because a humble and honest mind is more likely to yield to reason,
   than a perverse and cavilling temper is to submit to the sentence of an
   infallible judge, unless it were backed with an inquisition. The church
   of Rome supposeth herself infallible, and yet, notwithstanding that,
   she finds that some question and deny her infallibility, and then her
   sentence signifies nothing. And of those who own it, many dispute the
   sense and meaning of her sentence; and whether they deny the
   infallibility of her sentence, or dispute the sense of it, in neither
   of these cases will it prove effectual to the deciding of any
   difference.

   But after all this provision which we pretend God hath made for honest
   and sincere minds, do we not see that men fall into dangerous and
   damnable errors, who yet cannot, without great uncharitableness, be
   supposed not to be sincerely desirous to know the truth, and to do the
   will of God?

   To this I shall briefly return these two things.

   I. That the same errors are not equally damnable to all. The innocent
   and (humanly speaking) almost invincible prejudices of education in
   some persons even against a fundamental truth; the different capacities
   of men, and the different means of conviction afforded to them; the
   greater and lesser degrees of obstinacy, and a faulty will in opposing
   the truths proposed to them; all these, and perhaps several other
   considerations besides, may make a great difference in the guilt of
   men's errors, and the danger of them.

   II. When all is done the matter must be left to God, who only knoweth
   the hearts of all the children of men. We cannot see into the hearts of
   men, nor know all their circumstances, and how they may have provoked
   God to forsake them, and give them up to error and delusion, "because
   they would not receive the truth in the love of it, that they might be
   saved." And as, on the one hand, God will consider all men's
   circumstances, and the disadvantages they were under for coming to the
   knowledge of the truth, and make allowance to men for their invincible
   errors, and forgive them upon a general repentance: so, on the other
   hand, he who sees the insincerity of men, and that the errors of their
   understandings did proceed from gross faults of their lives, will deal
   with them accordingly. But if men be honest and sincere, God, who hath
   said "if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine," will
   certainly be as good as his word.

   It now remains only to draw some inferences from this discourse, and
   they shall be these three:

   First, From this text, and what hath been discoursed upon it, we may
   infer how slender and ill-grounded the pretence of the church of Rome
   to infallibility is; whether they place it in the pope, or in a general
   council, or in both. The last is the most general opinion; and yet it
   is hard to understand how infallibility can result from the pope's
   confirmation of a general council, when neither the council was
   infallible in framing its definitions, nor the pope in confirming them.
   If the council were infallible in framing them, then they needed no
   confirmation: if they were not, then infallibility is only in the pope
   that confirms them, and then it is the pope only that is infallible.
   But no man that reads these words of our Saviour, "if any man will do
   his will he shall know of the doctrine," would ever imagine that the
   bishop of Rome (whoever he shall happen to be) was secured from all
   fatal errors in matters of faith, much less that he were endowed with
   an infallible spirit, in judging what doctrines are from God, and what
   not. For it cannot be denied, but that many of their popes have been
   notoriously wicked and vicious in their lives: nay, Bellarmine himself
   acknowledged), that, for a succession of fifty popes together, there
   was not one pious and virtuous man that sat in that chair; and some of
   their popes have been condemned and deposed for heresy; and yet, for
   all this, the pope, and the governing part of that church, would hear
   the world in hand that he is infallible. But if this saying of our
   Saviour be true, that "if any man will do his will, he shall know of
   his doctrine, whether it be of God;" then every honest man, that
   sincerely desires to do the will of God, hath a fairer pretence to
   infallibility, and a clearer text for it, than is to be found in the
   whole Bible for the infallibility of the bishop of Rome. What would the
   church of Rome give, that there were but as express a text in Scripture
   for the infallibility of their popes, as this is for the security of
   every good man in his judgment of doctrines; which makes infallibility
   needless? What an insufferable noise, and what endless triumphs would
   they make upon it, if it had been any where said in the Bible, that if
   any man be bishop of Rome, and sit in St. Peter's chair, he shall know
   of my doctrine whether it be of God? Had there been such a text as
   this, we should never have been troubled with their impertinent
   citation of texts, and their remote and blind inferences, from Pasce
   Oves, and super hanc petram; "Feed my sheep;" "and upon this rock will
   I build my church;" to prove the pope's infallibility. And yet no man
   of sense or reason ever extended the text I am speaking to, so far as
   to attempt to prove from it the infallibility of every good man, but
   only his security from fatal errors and mistakes in religion. The
   largest promises that are made in Scripture of security from error and
   mistake about Divine things, are made to good men, who sincerely desire
   to do the will of God. And if this be so, we must conclude several
   popes to have been the farthest from infallibility of any men in the
   world. And, indeed, there is not a more compendious way to persuade men
   that the Christian religion is a fable, than to set up a lewd and
   vicious man for the oracle of it.

   Nay, I will go farther yet; that there are no other promises made in
   Scripture of direction or assistance, or security from mistake, to any
   church; but the same are made in as full and express terms to every
   good man that sincerely desires to know the truth, and to practise it.
   Is it promised to the church, or to the pastors of it, "I will be with
   you always?" And hath not our Saviour promised the same to every one
   that is obedient to his word? (John xiv. 23.) If any man love me, he
   will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come unto
   him, and make our abode with him?" And does not the apostle apply the
   same promise to every good Christian: (Heb. xiii. 5.) "I will never
   leave thee, nor forsake thee?" For where is the difference between
   these expressions, "I will be with you," and "I will make my abode with
   him;" "I will be with you always," and "I will never leave thee, nor
   forsake thee?" Is it not promised to the church, that "the Spirit shall
   lead her into all truth?" And is not the same promise made to every
   good man? (John xiv. 21.) "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth
   them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, shall be loved of
   my Father; and I will love him, and I will manifest myself to him;"
   that is, God will reveal his will to those that love him, and keep his
   commandments. Hath God promised to build his church upon a rock? And
   doth not our Saviour use the same metaphor concerning every man that
   doth the will of God? (Matth. vii. 24.) "Whosoever heareth these
   sayings of mine, and doth them, is like a wise man that built his house
   upon a rock." So that if to be built upon a rock signifies
   infallibility, it belongs to every good man who sincerely practiseth
   what he knows, as much as to any church.

   When men are enabled by God to work miracles for the confirmation of
   the doctrines which they deliver, there is great reason to believe that
   they are infallibly assisted in the delivery of those doctrines; but
   without this, it is the vainest thing in the world for any person or
   church to pretend to it, because they offer no evidence fit to satisfy
   any man that they are so assisted: and I do not hear that the pope,
   among all his privileges, does pretend to the power of miracles.

   Secondly, From hence, likewise, we may infer the great reason of error
   and infidelity in the world. If any man be an infidel, it is not the
   fault of his understanding, but of his will; it is not because there is
   not sufficient evidence that the Christian religion is from God, but
   because men's interests and lusts make them partial and incompetent
   judges of matters of religion. The evidence of the Christian religion
   is such as recommends it to every man's reason and conscience; so that
   (as St. Paul argues) "If the gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are
   lost; in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that
   believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
   the image of God, should shine unto them." (2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.)

   If men did but stand indifferent for the entertainment of truth, and
   were not swayed by the interest of any lust or passion, I am confident
   that no man that hath the gospel fairly proposed to him would continue
   an infidel. If men did but truly live up to the principles of natural
   religion, they would easily be convinced that the Christian religion,
   which is so suitable thereto, is from God.

   Thirdly and lastly, What hath been said is a great argument and
   encouragement to obedience and holiness of life. Do we desire not to be
   mistaken about the mind of God? let us heartily endeavour to do his
   will. If we would not be seduced by the error of the wicked, let us
   take heed of their vicious practices. The best way certainly to
   preserve a right judgment in matters of religion, is to take great care
   of a good life. God's goodness is such, that he will not suffer any
   man's judgment to be betrayed into a damnable error, without some vice
   and fault of his will. The principles of natural religion are born with
   us, and imprinted upon our minds, so that no man can be ignorant of
   them, nor need to be mistaken about them; and as for those revelations
   which God hath made of himself to the world, he hath been pleased to
   accompany them with so much evidence, that an honest and sincere mind
   may easily discern them from error and imposture. So our Saviour hath
   assured us, that if any man desire to do his will, "he shall know of
   the doctrine whether it be of God."

   On the other hand, if we see any oppose the clear truth, or depart from
   it, and embrace gross errors and delusions, we may almost certainly
   conclude that there is some worldly interest or lust at the bottom of
   it. So our Saviour has likewise told us, that the reason why "men love
   darkness rather than light," is, "because their deeds are evil; and
   every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light,
   lest his deeds should be reproved." I will conclude this whole
   discourse with St. Peter's exhortation, the 2d of Pet. iii. 17, 18. "Ye
   therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, be ware, lest
   ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your
   own steadfastness. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord
   and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory, both now and for ever.
   Amen."

SERMON LXXXIX.

  THE NATURE OF COVETOUSNESS.

   And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a
   man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
   possesseth.--Luke xii. 15.

   AMONG all the irregular appetites of men, there is none that is more
   common and unreasonable, and of a more universal bad influence upon the
   hearts and lives of men, than this of covetousness; and therefore, in
   speaking of this vice, I shall strike at the root of a great many
   others; even of apostacy from God's truth and religion, of which
   covetousness, and the love of this present world, is one of the most
   common causes. So that if I can contribute any thing to the cure of
   this great distemper of men's minds, I "hall, in .so doing, remove that
   which is the cause and occasion of a great part of the evils and
   mischiefs which are in the world. And to this end I have pitched upon
   these words of our blessed Saviour to his hearers: "And he said unto
   them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man's life
   consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."

   In which words are these three things observable:

   First, The manner of the caution which our Saviour here gives, "Take
   heed and beware;" he doubles it, to shew the great need and concernment
   of it.

   Secondly, The matter of the caution, or the vice which our Saviour here
   warns his hearers against, and that is covetousness: "Take heed, and
   beware of covetousness."

   Thirdly, The reason of this caution, "because a man's life consisteth
   not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth." Human life is
   sustained by a little, and therefore abundance is not necessary either
   to the support or comfort of it. It is not a great estate and vast
   possessions that make a man happy in this world; but a mind that is
   equal to its condition, whatever it be.

   First, The manner of the caution which our Saviour here gives, "Take
   heed and beware." This is a peculiar kind of caution, and no where
   else, or upon any other occasion that I know of, used in Scripture; in
   which, for the greater emphasis and weight, the words of caution are
   doubled, as if the matter were of so much concernment, that no caution
   about it could be too much, to signify to us both the great danger of
   this sin of covetousness, and the great care men ought to use to
   preserve themselves from it.

   I. The great danger of this sin; how apt we are to fall into this vice,
   and of how pernicious a consequence it is to those in whom it reigns.

   1. How apt are we to fall into this vice: and, excepting those vices
   which are immediately founded in a man's natural temper and
   constitution, there is none that men have a more universal propension
   to than this of covetousness. For there are two things which human
   nature docs more especially desire to be secured against, which are
   want and contempt: and riches seem to be a certain remedy against both
   these evils. And because men think they can never be sufficiently
   secured against these, therefore their desire of riches grows endless
   and insatiable; so that, unless men be very jealous and watchful over
   themselves, this desire will grow upon them, and enlarge itself beyond
   all bounds.

   2. As men are very apt to fall into this vice, so is it of very
   pernicious consequence to those in whom it reigns. The mischief of it
   is very great and very extensive: so Paul tells us, (1 Tim. vi. 8, 9,
   10.) where he presseth men to be contented with a small competency of
   the things of this life, because of the great danger and mischief of a
   covetous mind; "having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.
   But they that will be rich (that is, they that are bent and resolved
   upon being rich) fall into temptation and a snare, and into many
   foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
   perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil." But this I
   shall speak more fully to, when I come to shew the great evil and
   unreasonableness of this vice.

   II. This earnest kind of caution, as it signifies the great danger of
   this sin of covetousness, so likewise the great care that men ought to
   use to preserve themselves from it; for the greater the danger is in
   any kind, so much the greater care should be used for the avoiding of
   it. Men are not so solicitously concerned to defend themselves against
   a slight mischief; but when a terrible one threatens us, we should be
   continually upon our guard against it, and summon all our strength and
   force to resist it. Thus much for the manner of the caution.

   I proceed to the second thing to be considered in the text; viz. the
   matter of the caution, or the vice which our Saviour here warns his
   hearers against, and that is covetousness; "Take heed, and beware of
   covetousness." And in speaking of this, I shall consider these two
   things:

   I. Wherein the nature of this vice consists.

   II. I shall endeavour to shew the great evil and unreasonableness of
   it. I shall be large in both.

   I. For the nature of this vice of covetousness. The shortest
   description that I can give of it is this: that it is an inordinate
   desire and love of riches; but when this desire and love are
   inordinate, is not so easy to be determined. And therefore, that we may
   the better understand what the sin of covetousness is, which our
   Saviour doth so earnestly caution against, it will be requisite to
   consider more particularly wherein the vice and fault of it doth
   consist; that, whilst we are speaking against covetousness, we may not
   under that general word condemn any thing that is commendable or
   lawful. To the end, then, that we may the more clearly and distinctly
   understand wherein the nature of this vice doth consist, I shall

   First, Endeavour to shew what is not condemned under this name of
   covetousness, either in Scripture or according to right reason: and,

   Secondly, What is condemned by either of these, as a plain instance or
   branch of this sin.

   First, What things are not condemned under the name of covetousness,
   either in Scripture or according to right reason, which yet have some
   appearance of it; namely, these three things:

   1. Not a provident care about the things of this present life.

   2. Not a regular industry and diligence for the obtaining of them: nor,

   3. Every degree of love and affection to them. I mention these three,
   because they may all seem to be condemned by Scripture, as parts or
   degrees of this vice, but really are not.

   1. Not a provident care about the things of this present life. This,
   indeed, seems to be condemned in Scripture as a branch of covetousness;
   namely, in our Saviour's sermon upon the mount, (Matth. vi. 25.) "Take
   no thought for your life, what ye shall rat, or what ye shall drink;
   nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on." Here our Saviour seems to
   forbid all care, even about the necessaries of life, meat, and drink,
   and clothing, much more about the delights and conveniences of it. But
   this is not absolutely, and in ordinary cases, intruded by our Saviour
   to be condemned, as I shall shew by and by under the next head.

   2. Neither is a regular industry and diligence for the obtaining of
   these things condemned in Scripture; though this also seems to be
   prohibited by our Saviour, in the same chapter, (ver. 26.) "Behold the
   fowls of the air. for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather
   into barns, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them;" and, (ver. 28.)
   "Why take ye thought for raiment? consider the lilies of the field, how
   they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin." In which words our
   Saviour seems to intimate, that. we ought to depend upon the providence
   of God for food and raiment, and to use no more industry for the
   obtaining of them than the fowls of the air do, or the lilies of the
   field: and the same may seem to be collected out of this chapter of St.
   Luke; for after our Saviour had in my text cautioned them against
   covetousness, and spoken to them a parable to that purpose, of "a rich
   man who enlarged his barns, and laid up goods for many years," he
   infers from thence, (ver. 22.) that men should take no thought for the
   things of this life, nor use any industry about them: "And he said unto
   his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life,
   what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on."

   Now, to avoid all inconvenience from our Saviour's words, I think that
   it is commonly said by interpreters, that he does here only condemn a
   distrustful and anxious care about the things of this life, and an
   over-solicitous industry and diligence for the obtaining of them; but
   that he allows a prudent care and regular industry about these things:
   and this were very well said, if it would agree with the scope and
   design of our Saviour's discourse; but the instances which he gives of
   the fowls of the air, and the lilies of the field, which are
   sufficiently provided for without any care and industry of theirs, and
   which he seems to set before us for a pattern; "Behold (says he) the
   fowls of the air:" I say, these instances which he gives, seem to
   exclude even all regular and ordinary care and diligence about these
   things.

   What shall we say then, that our Saviour in tended by his religion to
   take men off from all labour and industry in their callings? This seems
   to be unreasonable; and indeed so it certainly were, if our Saviour had
   given this for a standing and ordinary rule to all Christians; and not
   only so, but contrary to the apostle's doctrine, who constantly charged
   Christians to labour with great diligence in their callings, that they
   might be able to provide for themselves and their families.

   But this discourse of our Saviour's was not in tended for a general and
   standing rule to all Christians; but only designed for his disciples,
   to take them oft from all care about the things of this life, that they
   might attend upon his person, and wholly give up themselves to that
   work to which he had called them. And therefore St. Luke takes notice,
   that, after he had cautioned his hearers in general against
   covetousness, he applies himself particularly to his disciples, and
   tells them, that he would have them so far from this vice of
   covetousness, that they should not so much as use that ordinary care
   and industry about the things of this life, which is not only lawful,
   but necessary for men in all ordinary cases, (ver. 22.) "And he said
   unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your
   life, what ye shall eat." And this agrees very well with the direction
   which our Saviour gave to his disciples, when he first sent them forth
   to preach: (Matth. x. 9.) "Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass,
   in your purses, neither coat nor scrip;" which no man ever understood
   as a general law to all Christians, but as a particular precept to the
   apostles at that time.

   And, if this be our Saviour's meaning, there is then no reason to think
   that this caution against covetousness does forbid men to use a
   provident care and regular industry about the things of this life.

   3. Nor is every degree of love and affection to the things of this
   world condemned in Scripture, as any branch or part of this vice of
   covetousness; but such a love of the things of this world as is truly
   consistent with the love of God, and a due and a serious care of our
   souls, is allowed both by Scripture and reason. St.. John indeed seems
   to condemn all love of the world, and of the things of it, as utterly
   inconsistent with the love of God; (1 John ii. 15.) "Love not the
   world, neither the things that are in the world; if any man love the
   world, the love of the Father is not in him:" but this is according to
   the Hebrew phrase and manner of speaking, to forbid things absolutely,
   which are to be understood only comparatively. So Matth. vi. 19. "Lay
   not up for yourselves treasures upon earth; but lay up for yourselves
   treasures in heaven;" i. e. be not so solicitous for the good things of
   this world, as for the glory and happiness of the next. And, (Luke xii.
   4.) "Be not afraid of them that kill the body;" that is, fear them not
   so much as "him that can destroy both body and soul in hell:" and,
   (Luke xiv. 20.) "If any man come unto me, and hate not his father and
   mother, and all that he hath;" that is, if he do not love me more than
   all these things, "he cannot be my disciple:" and, (John vi. 27.)
   "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth
   to everlasting life;" that is, labour not so much for the one as for
   the other--be not so solicitous about the things of this life as about
   the great concernments of eternity. So likewise (Coloss. iii. 2.) "Set
   your affections on things above, not on things on the earth;" i. e. set
   them more on things above, than on earthly things. So here, "Love not
   the world, neither the things of the world;" that is, do not overvalue
   them, do not love them so much as not to be able to part with them for
   Christ; for if any man thus love the world, he does not love God as he
   ought. So that when the Scripture commands us not to love the world,
   this is to be understood comparatively, that we should not love these
   things in comparison of God, and the great concernments of another
   world: but it does not forbid us to love these things in a due decree,
   and with a due subordination to those things which are more excellent,
   and of infinitely greater concernment to us. For nothing can be more
   inconsistent than to recommend to men diligence in their worldly
   callings and employments (as the Scripture frequently does), and that
   in order to the attaining of the good things of this life; and yet to
   forbid us to love these things at all. For if men have no degree of
   love to them, the best argument to diligence for the obtaining of them
   would be taken away. Besides that, we are commanded in Scripture to be
   thankful to God for bestowing on us the blessings of this life, and we
   are to love him upon this account. Now can any man love the giver for
   bestowing such gifts upon him, which, if he does as he ought, he must
   not love?

   You see then what those are which the Scripture does not condemn as any
   branch or degree of this vice of covetousness; a provident care and a
   regular industry, and such a degree of love to the things of this
   world, as is consistent with the love of God and the care of our soul.

   Secondly , I come now to shew what is condemned in Scripture under the
   name of covetousness; and by this we shall best understand wherein the
   nature of this sin doth consist. Now covetousness is a word of a large
   signification, and comprehends in it most of the irregularities of
   men's minds, either in desiring, or getting, or in possessing, and
   using an estate. I shall speak to each of these severally.

   I. Covetousness, in the desire of riches, consists in an eager and
   insatiable desire after the things of this world. This the Scripture
   condemns, though it be free from injustice, as it seldom happens to be.
   This insatiable desire of wealth, God plainly condemns by his prophet:
   (Isa. v. 8.) "Woe unto them that join house to house, and lay field to
   field, till there be no place, that they may he placed alone in the
   midst of the earth." And this is that which our Saviour here in the
   text seems to have a more particular respect to, when he cautions men
   against the sin of covetousness, as appears both from the reason which
   he gives of this caution, and from the parable whereby he illustrates
   it. From the reason which he gives of this caution, "Take heed, and
   beware of covetousness; for the life of man doth not consist in the
   abundance of the things which he possesseth." As if he had said, Take
   great care to set some bounds to your desires after the things of this
   world. For whatever men may imagine, it is certain, in experience, that
   it is not the abundance of outward things which makes the life of man
   happy. Wealth and content do not always dwell together; nay, so far
   from that, that perhaps they very seldom meet.

   And the parable likewise which follows upon this caution, doth
   sufficiently shew this to be our Saviour's meaning; for he illustrates
   what he was speaking of, by a rich man whose desire of wealth was never
   satisfied, but he was continually increasing his estate and enlarging
   his barns, to make more room still for his fruits, that he might "lay
   up goods in store for many years." The parable does not so much as
   intimate any indirect and unjust ways of gain which this man used to
   increase his estate, but condemns his insatiable desire and thirst
   after more; so that even this alone is covetousness, and a great fault,
   though it were attended with no other; because it is unreasonable and
   without end.

   II. There is covetousness likewise in getting an estate; and the vice
   or evil of this kind of covetousness consists chiefly in these three
   things.

   1. In the use of unlawful and unjust ways to get or increase an estate.
   He is a covetous man, who, by the greediness of gain, is tempted to do
   any unjust action, whether it be in the way of fraud and deceit, or of
   violence and oppression. And this, perhaps, is that which is most
   frequently in Scripture called covetousness. And this I take to be the
   meaning of the tenth commandment, "Thoushalt not covet;" wherein is
   forbidden all unjust desire of that which is another man's, and all
   unjust endeavours and attempts to deprive him of it. For so our Saviour
   renders it, Mark x. 19. where he says to the young man that came to be
   directed by him, what good thing he should do, that he might inherit
   eternal life--"Thou knowest the commandments, do not commit adultery,
   do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness;" and then,
   instead of the tenth commandment, "Thou shalt not covet," or rather by
   way of explication of it, he adds, me apostereses, defraud not; as if
   he had said in a word, Be not injurious to thy neighbour in any kind,
   in desiring or endeavouring to deprive him of any thing that is his. As
   the Romans in their laws were wont to comprehend those crimes, which
   had no proper name, by the general name of stellionatus and dolus
   malus; so here in the decalogue, after God had instanced in the chief
   and most common sorts of injuries which men are guilty of towards their
   neighbour, as murder, adultery, theft, bearing of false witness; he
   sums up all the rest, which could not so easily be reckoned
   particularly, in this short and general prohibition, "Thou shalt not
   covet;" that is, thou shalt not be injurious to thy neighbour in any
   kind; in his wife, or servant, or house, or cattle, "or any thing that
   is his." Covetousness, or any inordinate desire of that which is our
   neighbour's, being commonly the root and parent of all those kind of in
   juries.

   And for the same reason St. Matthew, instead of the tenth commandment,
   puts this general precept, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,"
   as being the sense of it in other words: (Matt. xix. 18, 19.) "Thou
   shalt do no murder, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not
   steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, honour thy father and thy
   mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." And this command
   of loving our neighbour as ourselves, our Saviour elsewhere tells us,
   was the sum of the duties of the second table; and it is the same in
   sense with that precept of our Saviour, (Matt. vii. 12.) "Therefore all
   things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so
   to them." That is, as thou wouldest have no man to be injurious to thee
   in any thing, so be not thou to any other man in any kind. And the
   apostle (Rom. xiii. 8, 9, 10.) shews us upon what account this general
   precept, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself," is the sum of the
   second table. "He that loveth another hath fulfilled the law; for this,
   thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not
   steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet; and if
   there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this
   saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." And then he
   adds, in the next words, "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour;
   therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." That is, he that truly
   loves his neighbour will not be injurious to him in any kind: therefore
   love is the sum of the law.

   The design of all this is to shew, that he that is injurious to his
   neighbour in his estate in any kind is properly guilty of the sin of
   covetousness, which is forbidden in the tenth commandment. So that all
   arts of fraud and oppression, whereby men endeavour to get and increase
   an estate by the injury of their neighbour, is a branch of the sin of
   covetousness.

   2. The vice of covetousness in getting wealth, does likewise consist in
   an anxious and tormenting care about obtaining the things of this life.
   The regular and due temper of a man's mind about the things of this
   world, is to commit ourselves to the providence of God in the use of
   honest and lawful endeavours, and to refer the success of all to his
   good pleasure; and whatsoever is beyond this, is a branch from the evil
   root of covetousness. We distrust the providence of God, when, after we
   had used our best endeavours, and begged his blessing upon them, we
   torment ourselves about the issue and event of things. And as this is
   sinful, so it is vain and to no purpose. Diligence in our business is
   the way to get an estate; but no man was ever the richer for tormenting
   himself because he is not so. The reason why men seek the things of
   this world, and take pains to get them, is to make life convenient and
   comfortable; and consequently, he that torments himself about the
   getting of these things contradicts himself, in his own design, because
   he makes his life miserable, that he may make it comfortable.

   3. The sin of covetousness in getting, consists in seeking the things
   of this life, with the neglect of things infinitely better, and which
   are of far greater and nearer concernment to us. He is a covetous man,
   who so minds the world, as to neglect God and his soul; who is so busy
   and intent upon making provision for this life, as to take no care of
   the other; so concerned for a few days of his pilgrimage here, as to
   have no consideration and regard for his eternal abode in another
   world. God allows us to provide for this life, and considers the
   necessities which do continually press us while we are in the body: but
   while we are making provision for these dying bodies, he expects that
   we should remember that we have immortal souls: which, since they are
   to have an endless duration in another world, ought to be provided for
   with far greater care. It is an inordinate desire of riches, when men
   so lay out all their care and industry for the obtaining of them, as if
   nothing else were to be regarded, as if no consideration at all were to
   be had of another world, and of that better part of ourselves which is
   to continue and live for ever. All desires and endeavours after riches,
   which take men off from the business of religion and the care of their
   souls, which allow men neither the leisure and opportunity, nor the
   heart and affection to love God and to serve him, are to be referred to
   the sin of covetousness, which is hero condemned by our Saviour in the
   text.

   III. There is covetousness likewise in possessing or using an estate;
   and this consists chiefly in these three things:

   First, When men are sordid towards themselves, and cannot find in their
   hearts to use and enjoy what they possess; are continually adding to
   their estate, without any design of enjoyment; and take infinite pains
   to raise a huge fortune, not that they may use it, but that they may be
   said to have it. This is a degree of covetousness even beyond that of
   the rich man in the parable after the text: for he, it seems, after he
   had enlarged his barns to his mind, and laid up goods for many years,
   designed at last to have taken his ease, and have fallen to the
   enjoyment of what he had gotten; "to have eat and drank, and to have
   been merry;" and this, though it proved but a foolish design in the
   issue, he being cut off in that very instant when he was come to the
   point of satisfaction and enjoyment; yet it is infinitely more
   reasonable, than to take great pains to get an estate with a full
   resolution never to be the better for it.

   Secondly, Men are covetous in keeping an estate, when they do not use
   it charitably; when they can not find in their hearts to spare any
   thing out of their abundance to the relief of those who are in want.
   Though a man get an estate without covetousness, and have a heart to
   enjoy it, yet so far he is covetous, as he is uncharitable. He loves
   money more than he ought, who, having enough to spare, chooseth rather
   to keep it than to do good with it, and to use it to one of the
   principal ends for which God gives an estate.

   Thirdly, They likewise are covetous who place their chief trust and
   happiness in riches, who (as the expression is, Job. xxxi. 24.) "make
   gold their hope, and say to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence." And
   this is the reason why covetousness is so often in Scripture called
   idolatry; because the covetous man sets up his riches in the place of
   God, putting his trust and confidence in them, and setting his whole
   heart upon them, loving them as he should love God only, with all his
   heart, and soul, and strength: and therefore mammon, which signifies
   riches, is in Scripture represented as a deity, and the covetous man,
   as a servant or worshipper of mammon.

   So that in Scripture he is a covetous man who placeth his chief
   felicity in a great fortune, and would venture to lose any thing rather
   than to part with that; who will quit his religion, and violate his
   conscience and run the hazard of his soul, rather than forfeit his
   estate, or the hopes of advancing it to his mind.

   And this, in times of trial and difficulty, is the great temptation to
   which the covetous man is exposed. When a man may not only save
   himself, but get considerable advantage by departing from the truth;
   and in changing his religion, may have a good sum of money to boot, or,
   which is equal to it, a good place; this to a covetous mind is a very
   strong temptation, and almost irresistible. When error and delusion can
   bid so high, and offer so good terms, no wonder if it gain some
   proselytes among the covetous and ambitious part of mankind. This the
   apostle gives warning of, as a great temptation to rich men in times of
   suffering: (1 Tim. vi. 9, 10.) "They that will be rich, fall into
   temptation and a snare: for the love of money is the root of all evil;
   which while some have lusted after, they have erred from the faith."
   The young man in the gospel is a sad in stance of this kind, who chose
   rather to leave Christ than to part with his great possessions. And
   such an one was Demas, who forsook the apostles, and Christianity
   itself, to cleave to this present world.

   Thus I have done with the first thing I proposed to speak to, the
   nature of this vice, which our Saviour in the text cautions men so
   earnestly against; "Take heed, and beware of covetousness." I shall now
   proceed, in the second place, to shew the evil and unreasonableness of
   this vice: but that shall be the subject of another discourse.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XC.

  THE EVIL AND UNREASONABLENESS OF COVETOUSNESS.

   And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a
   mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
   possesseth.--Luke xii. 15.

   I HAVE made entrance into a discourse upon these words, in which I told
   you there are three things observable.

   First, The manner of the caution which our Saviour here gives, "Take
   heed and beware."

   Secondly, The matter of the caution, or the sin which our Saviour here
   warns his hearers against, "Take heed, and beware of covetousness:"
   and,

   Thirdly, The reason of this caution, because "a man's life consisteth
   not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."

   In discoursing of the second of these, viz. the matter of the caution,
   I proposed,

   1. To consider wherein the nature of this vice of covetousness does
   consist.

   2. To shew the evil and unreasonableness of it. The first of these I
   have dispatched, and now go on to the second; viz. To shew the great
   evil and unreasonableness of the vice of covetousness.

   Now covetousness will appear to be very evil and unreasonable upon
   these following accounts.

   I. Because it takes men off from religion and the care of their souls.

   II. Because it tempts men to do many things which are inconsistent with
   religion and directly contrary to it.

   III. Because it is an endless and insatiable desire.

   IV. Because the happiness of human life doth not consist in riches.

   V. Because riches do very often contribute very much to the misery and
   infelicity of men.

   First, Covetousness takes men off from religion and the care of their
   souls. The covetous man is wholly intent upon this world; and his
   inordinate desire after these things, makes him to neglect God and the
   eternal concernments of his soul. He employs all his time, and care,
   and thoughts about these temporal things; and his vehement love and
   eager pursuit of these things steals away his heart from God, robs him
   of his time, and of all opportunities for his soul, and diverts him
   from all serious thoughts of another world and the life to come. And
   the reason of this is that which our Saviour gives: (Matt. vi. 24.) "No
   man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love
   the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye
   cannot serve God and mammon." No man can serve two masters so different
   as God and the world are; because they will give cross commands, and
   enjoin contrary things. God calls upon us to mind the duties of his
   worship and service, to have a serious regard to religion, and a
   diligent care of our souls: but the cares of the world, and the
   importunity of business, and an eager appetite of being rich, call us
   off from these Divine and spiritual employments, or disturb us in them.
   God calls upon us to be charitable to those that are in want, to be
   willing to distribute, and ready to communicate to the necessities of
   our brethren: but our covetousness pulls us back, and hales us another
   way, and checks all merciful and charitable inclinations in us. God
   calls us to self-denial, and suffering, for the sake of him and his
   truth, and commands us to prefer the keeping of faith and a good
   conscience to all worldly considerations whatsoever: but the world
   inspires us with other thoughts, and whispers to us "to save ourselves,
   not to be righteous over much;" and rather to trust God with our souls,
   than men with our bodies and estates.

   If we set our hearts and affections strongly upon any thing, they will
   partake of the object which they are conversant about; for where our
   treasure is (as our Lord hath told us) there will our hearts be also.
   If a great estate be our chief end and design, if riches be our
   treasure and our happiness, our hearts will be found among the stuff.
   We cannot bestow our affections freely upon two objects. We cannot
   intensely love God and the world; for no man can have two ultimate
   ends, two principal designs. Our riches may increase; but if we set our
   hearts upon them, and give them the chief place in our affections, we
   may make them our lord and master. What ever we make our ultimate end,
   we give it a sovereignty and empire over us; we put ourselves under its
   dominion, and make ourselves subject to all its commands. So that if it
   "bid us go, we must go; come, we must come; do this, we must do it;
   because we are under authority:" the world is our master, and we are
   its slaves. Now he that is under the rule and dominion of this master,
   must with draw his obedience from God, and, in many cases, decline
   obedience to his laws.

   This worldly covetous disposition was that which made those in the
   parable to make so many excuses, when they were invited to the supper:
   (Luke xiv. 18.) "One had bought a farm, and he could not come: another
   had bought so many yoke of oxen, and therefore he desired to be
   excused." Riches do so fill the covetous man's heart, and the cares of
   the world so possess his mind, that he hath no room left in his soul
   for any other guests: Intus existens prohibet alienum, "that which is
   full already can receive no more." The covetous man's heart is taken up
   with such things as keep out God, and Christ, and better things. "If
   any man love the world, and the things of it," to this degree, St. John
   tells us, that "the love of the Father is not in him." In the parable
   of the sower, (Matth. xiii. 7.) our Saviour represents to us, the cares
   of the world, which choke the word of God, by thorns which sprung up
   among the seed, and stifled the growth of it. The cares of the world
   will not suffer the word of God to take deep root in our hearts, and to
   have any permanent effect upon them: and, (Ezek. xxxiii. 31.) God gives
   this as a reason why the people of Israel would not hearken to the
   words of his prophet--because their hearts were upon the world. "They
   come unto thee (says God there to the prophet) as the people cometh,
   and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but
   they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but
   their hearts goeth after their covetousness." A heart that is deeply
   engaged in the world, will stand out against all the invitations, and
   promises, and threatenings of God's word. When the word of God invites
   such persons, it is like making love to those who have already fixed
   their hearts and affections elsewhere; the promises and threatenings of
   the gospel signify but very little to such men, because their hearts
   are set upon worldly things, and all their affections are bent that
   way; all their hopes and desires are worldly; to be rich and abound in
   wealth; and all their fears are of poverty and loss. Now such a man can
   only be moved with the promises and threatenings of temporal things;
   for no promises have any effect upon us, but such as are of some good
   which we care for and value: nor are any threatenings apt to move us,
   but such as are of some evil which we dread and are afraid of. And
   therefore, when eternal life, and the happiness of another world, are
   offered to a worldly-minded man, he does not desire it, he is not at
   all sensible of the value of it; the man's heart is full already of
   other hopes and desires, and "the full soul loatheth the honeycomb."
   Promise to such a man the kingdom of heaven, and the pleasures of God's
   presence, and the joys of eternity, this does not signify to such a man
   any good or happiness that he is sensible of, or knows how to relish.
   And, on the other hand, threaten him with the loss of God, and an
   eternal separation from that fountain of happiness, and with the
   unspeakable anguish and torments of a long eternity; these things,
   though they be terrible, yet they are at a distance, and the covetous
   man is inured to sense, and is only to be moved with things present and
   sensible; he can not extend his fears so far as another world, so long
   as he finds himself well and at ease as to the things of this present
   life.

   If we would affect such a man, we must offer to his consideration
   something that is fit to work upon him; threaten him with breaking open
   his house, and rifling his coffers, and carrying away his full bags;
   with questioning his title to his estate, or starting a precedent
   mortgage, or something of the like nature: these things indeed are
   dreadful and terrible to him; now you speak intelligibly to him, and he
   understands what you mean: tell him of a good bargain, or an
   advantageous purchase, offer him decently a good bribe, or give him
   notice of a young heir that may be circumvented and drawn in, then you
   say something to him that is worthy of his regard and attention; the
   man may be tempted by such offers and promises as these: but discourse
   to him with the tongue of men and angels, of the excellency of virtue
   and goodness, and of the necessity of it, to the obtaining of a glory
   and happiness that shall never have bounds nor end; and "Lo! thou art
   unto him as a lovely song of one that bath a pleasant voice, and can
   play well upon an instrument; for he hears thy words, but he will not
   do them;" as the prophet expressed) it, (Ezek. xxxiii. 32.) Such
   discourses as these they look upon as tine talk, or a melodious sound,
   that vanisheth into air, but leaves no impression behind it. Perhaps
   even these dull and stupid kind of men are affected a little for the
   present with the liveliness of the romance, and the poetical vein of
   the preacher; but these things pass away like a tale that is told, but
   have no lasting effect upon them. So effectually doth covetousness and
   the love of this present world obstruct all those passages, through
   which the consideration of religion and heavenly things should enter
   into our minds.

   Secondly, As covetousness hinders men from religion, and takes them off
   from a due care of their souls; so it many times tempts and engageth
   men to do many things contrary to religion, and inconsistent with it:
   it is the natural source and fountain of a great many evils, and the
   parent of most of the worst of vices. He that will engage deep in the
   world, must use much more guard and caution than most men do, to do it
   without sin. How many temptations is the covetous man exposed to in the
   getting, and in the securing, and in the spending, and enjoying of a
   great estate? It is no easy task to reckon them up, and much more
   difficult to escape or resist them, and yet each of these temptations
   brings him into the dangers of a great many sins. For,

   I. In the getting of an estate he is exposed to all those vices which
   may seem to be serviceable to this design. Nothing has been the cause
   of more and greater sins in the world than covetousness, and making
   haste to be rich. It is Solomon's observation, (Prov. xxviii. 20.) "He
   that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent." He does not say he
   cannot be innocent, but he speaks as if there were all the probability
   in the world that he will not prove to be so; but, being in so much
   haste, will almost unavoidably fall into a great many oversights and
   faults. And the heathen poet makes the same observation in more words:


   Inde fere scelerum causae, nec plura venena

   Miscuit, aut ferro grassatur saepius ullum

   Humanae mentis vitium, quam saeva cupido

   Immodici Census: nam dives qui fieri vult,

   Et cito vult fieri; sed quae reverentia legum,

   Quis metus aut pudor est unquam properantis avari?

   " This," says he, "is the cause of most sins: nor is there any vice of
   which the mind of man is capable, that hath been guilty of more murders
   and poisonings, than a furious desire of immoderate wealth; for he that
   will be rich, will make haste to be so: and what reverence of laws,
   what fear of shame, was ever seen in any man that was in haste to be
   rich?" And this is the sense of what the apostle says concerning this
   vice of covetousness, this peremptory resolution of being rich: (1 Tim.
   vi. 9, 10.) "They that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare,
   and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction
   and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil." If this
   vice of covetousness once reign in us, if we have once fixed our end,
   and set up this resolution with ourselves that we will be rich, we
   shall then make every thing stoop and submit to this design. A covetous
   man will make his principles and his conscience to bend to his
   resolution of being rich, and to bow to that interest. The eager desire
   of riches makes men to pursue them in indirect and uncharitable ways,
   by falsehood and perjury, by under mining and overreaching, by
   dissembling and flattery, by corrupting and embasing of commodities, by
   false weights and measures, by taking fees with both hands, by making
   use of their power and wit to oppress and defraud their brother, by
   imposing upon his ignorance and simplicity, or by making a prey of his
   poverty and necessity.

   Covetousness many times makes men cruel and unjust; nay, it makes them
   guilty of the worst sort of cruelty and oppression. For (as one says
   well) the covetous man oppresseth his neighbour not for any good to
   himself; for he does not enjoy what he tears and rends from others; so
   that he is of that most hateful kind of beasts of prey that kill other
   creatures, not to eat them, but that they may see them lie dead by
   them. Lions and wolves kill out of hunger; but the covetous man, like a
   serpent or scorpion, stings and bites others to death, not for his
   need, but for his pleasure and recreation. Covetousness is the parent
   of the most monstrous sins; because it fixeth a man in a resolution of
   getting an estate by any means. If falseness and deceit, violence and
   oppression, will further this end, the ear nest desire of the end
   tempts men to use any sort of means whereby the end may be compassed;
   and though a man may have some averseness from them at first, yet that
   wears off by degrees, and the strong desire of the end reconciles a man
   at last to the love and liking of the means, how wicked and
   unwarrantable soever. Covetousness tempted Achan to steal the accursed
   thing, and Gehazi to lie to the prophet, and Ahab to oppress and murder
   Naboth. Nay, a small sum tempted the covetous mind of Judas to betray
   his Master and his Saviour. And how do many men every day strain their
   consciences to get an estate, and hazard their own souls for money; nay
   exchange their souls, which are of more value than the whole world, for
   a very small portion of it?

   II. There are likewise many other temptations which a covetous man is
   exposed to in the keeping and securing an estate when he hath got it. A
   covetous and worldly-minded man, when it comes to the trial, is in
   great danger of quitting his religion, and "making shipwreck of faith
   and a good conscience." When his estate comes to be in hazard, he is
   very apt to fall off from the truth; it is a hundred to one but in
   these circumstances he will choose rather to violate his conscience
   than to forfeit his estate. What the devil falsely said of Job is true
   of the covetous man: "He does not serve God for nought." Upon these
   terms it was that Christ and the young man parted; "he had great
   possessions," and it troubled him to part with them. When Demas was
   brought to the trial, and put to it, whether he would stick to the
   profession of the gospel or his worldly possessions? he quitted St.
   Paul and declared for the world: (2 Tim. iv. 10.) "Demas hath forsaken
   me, having loved this present world." So far had his covetous humour
   besotted him, as to make him prefer his present interest in these
   temporal things before those eternal rewards which the gospel offered.

   III. There are likewise many temptations which men are exposed to in
   the enjoying and spending of a great estate. It is hard to have a great
   estate and not to be mastered by the love of it; not to have our cares
   and thoughts, our hearts and affections swallowed up by it. It is no
   easy thing for a man that hath riches not to overvalue them, and love
   them more than he ought; not to be puffed up by them, and so place his
   trust and confidence in them: (Prov. xviii. 11.) "The rich man's wealth
   is his strong city, and as a high wall in his own conceit." The
   covetous man setteth up his riches in the place of God, and is apt "to
   fall down before his golden calf and worship it: to say to the gold,
   Thou art my hope, and to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence: to
   rejoice because his wealth is great, and because his hand hath gotten
   much."

   Riches are a great temptation to irreligion and atheism. Upon this
   account Agur wisely prays to God for a moderate estate, because of the
   danger of both the extremes of riches and poverty; because of the great
   and violent temptations which men are exposed to in both these
   conditions: (Prov. xxx. 8, 9.) "Give me neither poverty nor riches, but
   feed me with food convenient for me." Why not riches? "Lest I be full
   and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord?" And much more do riches tempt
   men to pride and insolence towards others: (Prov. xviii. 23.) "The poor
   useth entreaties, but the rich answereth roughly." Men's spirits are
   commonly blown up and bloated with their fortunes, and their pride, and
   stomach, and passion, do usually increase in proportion to their
   wealth.

   And many times riches tempt men to luxury and intemperance, and all
   manner of excess. Rich men have a mighty temptation to allow themselves
   all manner of unlawful pleasures; because he who hath a great estate is
   furnished with that to which hardly any thing can be denied. And this
   is not inconsistent with a covetous humour; for there are, many times,
   men who are covetous in getting, for no other end and reason but that
   they may spend it upon their lusts. As covetousness sometimes starves
   other vices, so sometimes it serves them, and is made subordinate to a
   man's ambition, or lust, or some other reigning vice. There is no such
   absolute inconsistency between riches and virtue, but that it is
   possible that a man that is very rich may be very good. But yet, if we
   consult experience, I doubt it will be found a true observation, that,
   there are but very few rich men who are not insupportable, either for
   their vanity or their vices; so that our Saviour had reason for that
   severe question: "How hard is it for a rich man to enter into the
   kingdom of God?" And well might he upon this account pronounce the poor
   (the poor in estate, as well as the poor in spirit) blessed, as we find
   he does: (Luke vi. 20.) "Blessed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom
   of God." They oftener enter there than the rich.

   Thirdly, Covetousness is likewise evil and unreasonable, because it is
   an endless and insatiable desire. A covetous mind may propose to itself
   some certain bounds and limits; and a man may think that when he is
   arrived to such an estate, and hath raised his fortune to such a pitch,
   that he will then sit down, contented and satisfied, and will seek
   after no more. But he deceives himself in this mat ter; for when he
   hath attained to that which he proposed to himself, he will be never
   the nearer being satisfied. So Solomon tells us: (Eccles. v. 10.) He
   that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that
   loveth abundance with increase; for no degree of wealth can satisfy a
   covetous mind. He may think so beforehand, that if he had so much it
   would be enough; but when he hath attained it he will be still reaching
   after more; for covetousness is a disease of the mind, and an unnatural
   thirst which is inflamed by that which should quench it. Every desire
   that is natural is satisfied and at rest, when it hath once obtained
   the thing it desired. If a man be hungry, he is satisfied when he hath
   eaten; or if he be thirsty, his thirst is allayed and quenched when he
   hath drank to such a proportion as nature doth require; and if he eat
   and drink beyond this measure, nature is oppressed, and it is a burden
   to him. But covetousness is not the thirst of nature, but of a diseased
   mind. It is the thirst of a fever, or of a dropsy; the more a man
   drinks the more he desires, and the more he is inflamed. In like
   manner, the more the covetous man increaseth his estate, the more his
   desires are enlarged and extended, and he finds continually new
   occasions and new necessities; and every day as he grows richer, he
   discovers new wants; and a new poverty to be provided against, which he
   did not think of before, comes into his mind: Et minus haec optat, qui
   non habet; "and he that is without these things covets them less than
   he that hath them." So far is a covetous man's attaining to riches from
   giving him satisfaction, that he who hath scarce any thing at all is
   many times much nearer to contentment than he that hath got so much;
   nay, so unreasonable is this appetite, as to desire more, even when the
   man knows not how to bestow what he hath already. This Solomon observed
   long since (for the vices and humours of men are much the same in all
   ages), Eccles. iv. 8. "There is one alone, and there is not a second;
   yea, he hath neither child nor brother; yet is there no end of all his
   labours, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, neither saith he,
   For whom do I labour and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity,
   yea, it is a sore travail." And indeed what can be greater vanity and
   folly, than to be at certain pains and labour all the days of a man's
   life, and yet to be uncertain all the while for whom it is that he
   drudgeth and taketh all these pains?

   And if this be the nature of this vice, the more it gets still to covet
   the more, then nothing can be more unreasonable than to think to
   gratify this appetite; because, at this rate, the man can never be
   contented, because he can never have enough; nay, so far is it from
   that, that every new accession to his fortune sets his desires one
   degree farther from rest and satisfaction; for a covetous mind having
   no bounds, it is very probable that the man's desire will increase much
   faster than his estate; and then the richer he is, still the poorer,
   because he is still the less contented with his condition. However, it
   is impossible that the man's desire should ever be satisfied; for
   desire being always first, if the man's desire of riches advanceth and
   goes forward as fast as riches follow, then it is not possible for
   riches ever to overtake the desire of them, no more than the hinder
   wheels of a coach can overtake those which are before; because, as they
   were at a distance at first setting out, so let them go never so far or
   so fast, they keep the same distance still.

   So that it is the vainest thing in the world for a man to design his
   own satisfaction by the perpetual increase of his fortune, because
   contentment doth not arise from the abundance of what a man hath, but
   it must spring from the inward frame and temper of our minds; and the
   true way to it is not to enlarge our estate, but to contract our
   desires; and then it is possible that a man's money and his mind may
   meet; otherwise the pursuit is endless, and the farther a man follows
   contentment, it will but flee so much the farther from him; and when he
   hath attained the estate of a prince, and a revenue as great as that of
   France or the Turkish empire, he shall be farther from being satisfied
   than when he began the world, and had no more beforehand than would
   just pay for his next meal.

   I should now have proceeded to the fourth thing, whereby the
   unreasonableness of covetousness doth appear; because the happiness of
   human life doth not consist in riches. And this is the argument which I
   shall more especially insist upon, because it is that which our Saviour
   useth here in the text to take men off from this vice: "The life of man
   consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth." And
   this, certainly, is one of the best and most reasonable considerations
   in the world, to moderate men's affections towards these things. Every
   reasonable desire propounds some end to itself. Now to what purpose
   should any man desire to increase his wealth so vastly beyond the
   proportion of his necessities and real occasions? What benefit and
   advantage would it be to any man to have a hundred times more than he
   knows what to do withal? But I shall not enlarge upon this argument at
   present, but refer it to another opportunity.

SERMON XCI.

  THE EVIL AND UNREASONABLENESS OF COVETOUSNESS.

   And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a
   mans life consisteth not in the^ abundance of the things which he
   possesseth.--Luke xii. 15.

   AFTER I had, in my first discourse upon this subject, given you an
   account of the nature of the vice of covetousness, I proceeded in the
   next place to represent the great evil and unreasonableness of it.

   First, Because it takes men off from religion and the care of their
   souls.

   Secondly, Because it tempts men to many things which are inconsistent
   with religion, and directly contrary to it.

   Thirdly, Because it is an endless and insatiable desire. Thus far I
   have gone; I proceed to the

   Fourth thing, whereby the unreasonableness of covetousness will yet
   farther appear: namely, because the happiness of human life doth not
   consist in riches and abundance. And this I shall insist upon somewhat
   the more largely, because it is the argument which our Saviour makes
   use of here in the text, to take men off from this sin: "The life of
   man consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
   Therefore, take heed, and beware of covetousness." And this, certainly,
   is one of the best and most reasonable considerations in the world to
   moderate our affections to wards these things. For every reasonable
   desire propounds some end to itself. Now to what purpose should any man
   desire to increase his wealth so vastly, and beyond the proportion of
   his necessities and real occasions? What benefit and advantage can it
   be to any man, to have a hundred or perhaps a thousand times more than
   he knows what to do withal?

   And as for the other world, no man ever pretended that the heaping up
   riches here would be useful to him there; "riches will not deliver him
   in the day of wrath." No man was ever so senseless as to imagine that
   he could take his estate along with him into the other world; or if he
   could, that heaven was to be bought with money; or that a great estate,
   or a great many lordships, would recommend him to the favour of God. It
   is true, indeed, a man may so use riches in this world, as thereby to
   promote and further his happiness in the next. But then it is likewise
   as true, that a man may so demean himself in a poor and low condition
   as thereby to render himself as acceptable to God, and capable of as
   great a reward, as the richest man can do. The poor woman's two mites,
   cheerfully given to pious and charitable uses, will go as far in the
   other world, and find as great a reward there, as the rich man's
   thousands of gold and silver. And a man may be as truly generous and
   charitable out of a little, as out of the greatest fortune. Besides
   that, the poor man's contentedness in a mean condition is more
   admirable in itself, and more valuable with God, than for a rich man to
   be so. So that the great use of riches respects this world, and the
   best use of them is in ways of charity; and the poor man's charity,
   though it cannot be of so great an extent in the effects of it, yet in
   the degree of its virtue and merit it may be equal to it.

   Now the two great designs of men, in regard to this world, are these:

   1. To maintain and support our lives as long as we can.

   2. To make our lives as truly happy and comfortable as we can.

   To the first of these ends, namely, the support of our lives, a very
   little will suffice; and it is not much that is necessary to the other,
   to render our lives as truly comfortable as this world can make them;
   so that a vast estate is not necessary to either of these ends; for a
   man may live by having what is necessary, and may live comfortably by
   having that which is convenient.

   No man lives the longer by having abundance; it is many times an
   occasion of shortening a man's life by ministering to excess and
   intemperance, but seldom of prolonging it. And, setting aside the vain
   fancy and conceit of men, no man lives the more happily for having more
   than he hath real use and occasion for.

   These two heads I shall at present speak to, to make out the full force
   of this reason which our Saviour here useth; namely, that "a man's life
   consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."

   I. That riches do not contribute to the support of our lives; nor,

   II. To the happiness and comfort of them. That is, they are not
   necessary to either of these ends. For by riches, I mean whatever is
   beyond a competency of those things which are requisite to the real
   uses and occasions of human life.

   First, Riches and abundance do not contribute to the support of our
   lives. And this our Saviour very well represents to us in the parable,
   immediately after the text, of the rich man who was continually
   increasing his estate, so that "he had goods laid up for many years;"
   but he lived not one jot the longer for being provided of the
   conveniences of life for so long a time beforehand; for whilst he was
   blessing himself as if he had secured his happiness sufficiently for
   this world, he was uncertain of his continuance in it; God having
   decreed to take him out of this world, at that very time when he had
   determined to enter upon the enjoyment of those things which he had
   been so long laying up. God says to him, "Thou fool, this night shall
   thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall those things be
   which thou hast provided?" that is, what good then will all these
   things do thee, when thou hast no further use of and occasion for them?
   So that if he had been the poorest man in the world, and had not been
   provided for the next meal, he might have lived as long as he did with
   all his stores. You see, then, that in this sense, "a man's life
   consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."
   For, notwithstanding all his great barns, and the abundance of fruits
   he had stowed in them, he did not live one jot the longer than the
   poorest man might have done.

   Secondly, Nor do riches contribute to the happiness and comfort of our
   lives. Happiness is not to be bought and purchased together with great
   lord ships; it depends upon a great many causes, among which a
   competency of the things of this world is one; but riches and abundance
   is none of them. The happiness of this world consists in these two
   things.

   1. In the enjoyment of good. And,

   2. In a state of freedom from evil.

   Now riches do not necessarily make a man happy in either of these
   respects.

   First, For the enjoyment of good, a competent estate suitable to the
   condition and station in which God hath set us in this world, will give
   a man what ever nature and reason can desire, and abundance cannot make
   a man happier. If a man had a hundred times more than he needed, he
   could but enjoy it according to the capacity of a man; for if he
   consulted his own happiness, and would truly enjoy what he hath, he
   must eat and drink within the bounds of temperance and health, and must
   wear no more clothes than are for his convenience. It is true he hath
   wherewithal to put on a new suit every day, which is to be uneasy all
   the days of his life; and may drink, if he pleases, every time out of a
   new cup, which would be a vain expense and a great trouble to his
   servants, without any manner of convenience to himself.

   But then if riches fall into the covetous man's hands they can be no
   happiness to him, because he hath no heart to enjoy them. He hath
   indeed the estate of a rich man, but he wants the comfort of it,
   because he hath the mind of a poor man, and enjoyment is all the
   felicity that is in a great fortune; what we enjoy is ours, but what we
   lay up is, from that time, not ours but somebody's else. He that heaps
   up riches, and enjoys them not, is rich only for his heir, but a beggar
   for himself.

   We are apt to pity poor men, and too apt to despise them; but surely no
   man's condition is more to be deplored than his, who starves himself in
   the midst of plenty, and being surrounded with the blessings of God
   turns them into the greatest curse; for it is a much greater curse, not
   to use an estate when one has it, than not to have it. It is like a
   plentiful table without an appetite.

   But it may be it is a great happiness to have a great estate, though a
   man never use it; the pleasure of seeing it and telling it over may be
   like the removing of billets; which may warm a man as much as if he had
   spent and consumed them. But this is real, and the other only
   imaginary. I doubt not many covetous men take a great deal of pleasure
   in ruminating upon their wealth, and in recounting what they have; but
   they have a great deal of tormenting care and fear about it, and if
   they had not, it is very hard to understand where the reason able
   pleasure and happiness lies of having things to no end. It is, at the
   best, like that of some foolish birds, which, they say, take pleasure
   in stealing money that they may hide it; as if it were worth the while
   for men to take pains to dig silver out of the earth, for no other
   purpose but to melt it down and stamp it, and bury it there again.

   But many necessities may happen, which we can not foresee, and it is
   good to provide against them. There is nothing so bad, but something
   may be said in excuse of it; and I do not deny, but that a provident
   cure against the common accidents of human life is very commendable;
   but it is unreasonable to think of providing against all possibilities,
   which it is impossible either to foresee or prevent. It is very
   possible, that after a man hath gotten the greatest estate imaginable,
   he may lose it all by some fatal accident; and then to what purpose was
   all this provision made, when that, which was so long a time a getting
   and laying up, is lost at once?

   Besides that, it is not easy to conceive what necessity can happen to a
   covetous man to give him an occasion of using his estate; he cannot
   find in his heart to bestow it upon himself in such things as are
   convenient, nay almost necessary for the support of his life; for no
   man can feed his servants more penuriously than he does himself; all
   the religion he values himself upon, is a strict observance of the
   Lessian diet which he recommends to those few that can deny themselves
   to dine with him, in hopes to make better meals upon his estate when he
   is gone. And if he be so penurious to himself, the necessities of
   others are not like to move him to be liberal. I can but imagine one
   occasion that could tempt such a man to lay out what he hath; namely,
   when one part of his estate is in danger, to spend the other to secure
   it. And yet, even in that case, if his cause were not very clear and
   good, he would go nigh to lose it, using it as he does himself; that
   is, by starving it. And if this be all, then a man had as good be
   without an estate, and save himself the trouble either of getting it or
   securing it; for if it were all gone, he might live as well as he does,
   and that with half the care and pains.

   Secondly, The happiness of this world consists in a state of freedom
   from evil. Now the great evils that men are liable to in this world are
   such as are incident to them, either in the course of their lives or at
   the time of their death; and riches do not contribute to men's
   happiness by freeing them from either of these. I shall speak to these
   severally.

   I. Not from the evils which are incident to men in the course of their
   lives. These are of two kinds, inward or outward.

   1. Inward evils, by which I mean those of the mind; and our greatest
   troubles are from within, from the anxiety of our minds and the guilt
   of our consciences, from the vicious inclinations of our wills, and the
   irregularity and disorders of our passions. Now riches were an
   admirable thing indeed, and worth our coveting, if they would help to
   cure these distempers of our minds; but they are the least fitted for
   such a purpose of any thing in the world; for not he that hath the
   greatest estate, but he that hath the fewest and most reasonable
   desires, and the best governed passions and the most virtuous
   inclinations, is the happiest man, and dwells nearest to satisfaction.
   Nemo malus felix, "no bad man can be happy," though he were possessed
   of the whole world; because he hath that within him which frets and
   discontents him, which galls his spirit and keeps his mind restless and
   uneasy; and he that does not enjoy himself can enjoy nothing else.

   Did but men know how much happiness hath been enjoyed by many a pious
   and virtuous man in a mean fortune, how quiet and easy their minds have
   been, how much fuller of joy and pleasure, than the heart of any
   covetous worldling ever was in his most prosperous estate, and when his
   corn, and .wine, and oil abounded; did we, I say, but know this we
   should not envy the men of mighty fortunes. Nam neque divitbus
   contingunt gaudia solis; "Rich men are not the only happy people in the
   world." If they be not good as well as rich, happiness is a greater
   stranger to their dwellings than to the cottages of poorer men.

   Now riches are so far from helping to make men good, that they are one
   of the greatest temptations to them in the world to be otherwise; which
   is the reason why our Saviour says, it is so very hard for a rich man
   to enter into the kingdom of heaven; because, considering the powerful
   and almost irresistible temptations of a great estate, and the
   impotency and weakness of human nature to govern itself in a plentiful
   fortune, it is very hard for a rich man to be so good as he ought, it
   requires a great force and firmness of resolution, a very solid and
   vigorous constitution of mind, to bear a great fortune, and not to be
   corrupted by it; and a man hath never more reason to implore God's
   gracious help and assistance, and to consult his own best and coolest
   thoughts, to know what he ought to do, and how he ought to demean
   himself, than when the outward blessings of this life flow in amain
   upon him; felicitate corrumpimur, "nothing sooner debaucheth men than
   prosperity;" and he is a very happy man whom wealth and a good fortune
   do not make licentious and dissolute; because these tempt men with the
   power and opportunity to do all the ill that their wicked hearts can
   design or desire.

   The temptation of riches, and the power that goes along with them, is
   so forcible and prevalent, that the devil, who is a sagacious spirit,
   and hath great and long experience in this kind, when he was making the
   experiment, whether Christ was a mere man or the Son of God, reserved
   this for his last temptation, resolving, if that would not do, to try
   him no farther. After he had assaulted him in several kinds, he
   represents to him at last that which was sufficient to have surfeited
   two of the most insatiable desires of human nature, ambition and
   covetousness, even "all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
   them, in a moment (or point) of time;" he brings all the rays of this
   glory to one point, that the temptation might kindle and take hold the
   sooner; and says to him, "all this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall
   down and worship me." He supposed, with great probability, that, if he
   were but a mere man, the strongest and most resolved mind would bend
   and yield to so dazzling a temptation as this; but when he saw that
   this temptation was rejected, he found himself baffled and gave him
   over; since this did not move him, he concluded now that he was the Son
   of God indeed, and that it was in vain to tempt him any farther.

   From all this it appears, that riches are so far from making men
   virtuous, that nothing is more dangerous to virtue than a full
   condition, if men have not a great degree of grace, as well as
   discretion, to manage it. Solomon tells us, that the prosperity of
   fools destroyeth them.

   And yet how do most of us court this temptation, and are forward to
   thrust and venture ourselves upon it? there are a great many other
   things, in which most men make a right judgment of themselves, and will
   readily acknowledge that they are altogether unfit for them. Every man
   will not take upon him to be a physician, or a lawyer, to prescribe
   medicines in dangerous cases, and to give counsel to men in knotty and
   difficult points about their estates; but every man thinks himself fit
   enough to be rich, and sufficiently qualified to manage a great estate
   if he can but get it; when perhaps there are few things in the world,
   which men are more insufficient for, than to wield and govern a great
   fortune, nor wherein there is greater danger of miscarriage. It is not
   every body's talent to be wealthy and wise, rich and innocent.

   2. As for the outward evils of this life, such as want and contempt,
   bodily pains and diseases, unhappiness in friends and relations, a
   great estate is by no means a sufficient security or remedy to a
   covetous man against these.

   (1.) As for want. And surely one would think, that if riches were good
   for any thing they are a very proper remedy against this evil, and a
   most certain and infallible cure of it; but experience tells us quite
   otherwise. Socrates was wont to say, that, "To want nothing is the
   privilege of the Deity, and proper to God alone; but to stand in need
   of as few things as may be, is the privilege of a wise and good man,
   and a state of happiness next to that of God himself; because he that
   hath the fewest wants is the most easily supplied, and is next to him
   that is self-sufficient." Now a man of moderate desires hath infinitely
   fewer wants than a covetous man; and because his desires are moderate,
   a moderate estate will satisfy them: but the wants of a covetous mind
   are never to be supplied, because it hath ordered the matter so
   cunningly as to want even that which it hath: such a man does not get
   riches to supply his wants, but is content to want that he may be rich;
   insomuch that he hath not the heart to use his estate for the supply of
   his real necessities. How many do almost starve themselves in the midst
   of plenty and abundance? There is no greater sign of poverty than to be
   deeply in debt: now the covetous man lives and dies in debt to himself.
   Some men have been so shamefully penurious and stingy to themselves as
   even to die to save charges, which yet perhaps is the most generous
   thing they ever did in their whole lives, in respect to the world;
   because by this means somebody may come to the enjoyment of their
   estates; and that great dunghill which they have been so long in raking
   together, may by this means come to be spread abroad for the public
   benefit.

   So that if a covetous man were possessed of the wealth of both the
   Indies, all this would not free him from want. A poor man's wants may
   be satisfied, when he hath obtained what he wants: but the covetous man
   labours of an incurable want; because he wants that which he hath, as
   well as that which he hath not.

   (2.) As for contempt, riches will not secure a covetous man against
   this neither; nay, so far is it from that, that he is commonly more
   ridiculous and despised for living poor in the midst of abundance, than
   if he were really so. Did I say really so? He is the most really poor
   of all other men. For, as one says well, "The rich poor man is
   emphatically poor."

   (3.) Neither will riches free men from bodily illness and pain. The
   rich are liable to as many diseases, and as sharp pains, as the poor,
   and they have commonly less patience to bear them than the poor;
   because they have not been inured to other sorts of evils. They that
   have been accustomed to labour, are generally best fitted to bear pain;
   the rich are commonly more tender and delicate, and have a quicker
   sense of pain, more matter, and greater quantity of humours to feed a
   disease, and to in flame it to a greater height.

   I must not here forget that there is a sort of rich men, I mean the
   penurious mix is, who starve themselves move than the poor, and fare
   many times more hardly; and, for this reason, though they be not in
   danger of the diseases that come from intemperance and a plentiful
   table, yet they are liable to the diseases which proceed from starving
   and emptiness; which the physicians say are more dangerous than the
   other: so that neither the prodigal nor the niggardly rich man is
   secured from bodily pains and diseases by a great estate.

   (4.) Neither will riches secure a man from being unhappy in his friends
   and relations. A great estate will not make a man's children either
   more dutiful or wise than the children of meaner persons; and if they
   be not so, his estate cannot be so great a happiness to him, as they
   may prove an affliction. Solomon tells us, that the very fear and
   apprehension of this did very much embitter the fruit of all his
   labour; and he seems to speak it sensibly, and very probably with a
   melancholy reflection upon his son Rehoboam: (Eccles. ii. 18, 19.)
   "Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun, because I
   should leave it unto the man that shall be after me; and who knows
   whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? Yet shall he have rule over
   all my labour, wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed
   myself wise under the sun." "Who knows whether he shall be a wise man
   or a fool?" he seems to speak doubtfully: but he had a very shrewd
   guess what kind of man his son would make; for he speaks more
   despondingly in the next words: (ver. 20, 21.) "Therefore I went about
   to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the
   sun;" that is, when I thought seriously of it, I began to think, that
   all the pains I had taken to get an estate would be but to little
   purpose; "for there is a man (saith he) whose labour is in wisdom, and
   in knowledge, and in equity (that is, who by wise and honest means hath
   raised a great estate); yet to a man that hath not laboured therein
   (that is, to a man who is endowed with none of these qualities) shall
   he leave it for his portion; this also is vanity, and a great evil."

   And as for friends, though the rich man have many that will call
   themselves so, yet he had al most as good have none; for he can hardly
   ever know whether they be so or not, unless he chance to fall into
   poverty; and then, indeed, the change of his condition may give him
   that advantage and opportunity, which Otherwise he is never like to
   have, of discerning between his friends and his flatterers. Thus you
   see that riches are no security against the most considerable evils
   which attend us in the course of our lives.

   II. When we come to die, nothing will minister less comfort to us, at
   that time, than a great estate. It is then a very small pleasure to a
   man to reflect how much he hath gotten in the world, when he sees that
   he must leave it; nay, like the young man in the gospel, he goes away
   so much the more "sorrowful, because he hath great possessions." All
   the things of this world seem very inconsiderable to a man, when he
   approaches to the confines of the other: for when he sees that he must
   leave this world, then he would fain make a virtue of necessity, and
   begins to change his apprehensions of these things, and to have very
   slight and mean thoughts of them, when he is convinced he can enjoy
   them no longer. What the philosopher was wont to say of the pleasures
   of this world, is as tin. of riches, and all the other enjoyments of
   it; that, "if they did but put on the same countenance, and look with
   the same face, when they come to us, that they will do when they turn
   from us, and take their leave of us, we should hardly entertain them."

   Now if a man have placed his chief happiness in this world, as the
   covetous man does in his riches, his great trouble, when he comes to
   die, will be, that he must leave them. Nothing could be more severely
   said to the covetous man, than that which God says to the rich man in
   the parable: "Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee,
   and then whose shall these things be?" For of all things in the world,
   such men cannot endure to think of parting with these things, or that
   what they have got, with such great care and labour, should come to the
   possession of another.

   And therefore, when we are so hot and eager in the pursuit of these
   things, we should do well to consider how they will appear to us in a
   dying hour. And this consideration well imprinted upon our minds would
   make us very careful, to treasure up other kind of comforts to
   ourselves against such a time, and to labour after those things which
   we shall never grow out of conceit withal, but shall value them to the
   last, and then most of all when we come to die, and leave this world.
   For as a poet of our own says excellently,


   'Tis not that which first we love;

   But what dying we approve.

   Thus I have done with the fourth thing, whereby the evil and
   unreasonableness of covetousness doth appear; namely, that the
   happiness of human life doth not consist in a great estate; "the life
   of man doth not consist in the abundance of the things which he
   possesseth." The great ends of religion, and covetousness are very
   different. The great end which religion proposeth to itself is
   happiness; but the great end which covetousness proposeth is riches;
   which are neither a necessary nor a probable means of happiness. I
   should now have proceeded to the fifth and last particular; namely,
   that riches are so far from being the happiness of human life, that
   they usually contribute very much to our misery and sorrow; as will
   appear, if we consider these four things.

   First, The labour and care which covetous men are at in the getting of
   a great estate.

   Secondly, The anxiety of keeping it, together with the fears of losing
   it.

   Thirdly, The trouble and vexation of losing it; and,

   Fourthly, The dreadful and heavy account which every man must give of a
   great estate. But these particulars, together with the application of
   this whole discourse, I shall refer to another opportunity.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XCII.

  THE EVIL AND UNREASONABLENESS OF COVETOUSNESS.

   And he said unto them, Take heed and beware of covetousness; for a mans
   life consist eth not in the abundance of the things which he
   possesseth.--LUKE xii. 15.

   IN my two last discourses on this subject, I have represented the evil
   and unreasonableness of the vice of covetousness in four particulars. I
   proceed now to the fifth and last particular, whereby I told you the
   evil and unreasonableness of it would appear; viz.

   That riches are so far from being the happiness of human life, that
   they usually contribute very much to our misery and sorrow; as will
   evidently appear, if we consider these four things:

   First, The labour and care which the covetous man is at in getting of a
   great estate.

   Secondly, The anxiety of keeping it, together with the fears of losing
   it.

   Thirdly, The trouble and vexation of having lost it.

   Fourthly, The heavy and dreadful account which every man must give of a
   great estate.

   First, The labour and care which the covetous man hath in getting a
   great estate. He that will be rich must sweat for it, and refuse no
   pains and trouble; he must "rise up early and lie down late, and eat
   the bread of carefulness." A slave that digs in the mines, or rows in
   the galleys, is not a greater drudge than some covetous worldlings are;
   only, with this difference, that the covetous man thinks that he
   labours and takes all these pains for himself; whereas the slave
   understands the matter more truly, and thinks that he does it for
   another.

   But besides the pains he takes, he is full of care and anxiety. How is
   he, through the greedy desire of having, racked between the hopes of
   getting and the fear of missing what he seeks? The apostle observes
   what tormenting cares accompany this vice: (1 Tim. vi. 10.) "The love
   of money (saith he) is the root of all evil;" not only of the evil of
   sin, but of the evil likewise of trouble and disquiet. For it follows,
   "which, while some coveted after, they have pierced themselves through
   with many sorrows:" variety of troubles attend them that will be rich.

   Secondly, If we consider the anxiety of keeping what they have got,
   together with the fear of losing it again, this is another great part
   of a covetous man's infelicity. The rich man here in the parable after
   the text, when he saw his estate coming upon him so fast, cries out,
   "what shall I do?" Poor man! who would not pity his condition, to see
   him put to this difficulty and distress, and to hear him make as heavy
   a moan as the poorest man could do! Now that he hath a plentiful
   harvest, and his crop hath answered, if it were possible, his covetous
   desire, he is in a great deal of perplexity, and almost at his wits end
   how to dispose of it: he was horribly afraid lest any of it should be
   lost for want of a secure place to store it up in: "what shall I do,
   because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?" Where was the
   difficulty of this? Why, he was loath to lose his fruits, and he was
   loath to lay out money to secure them. But, upon farther consideration,
   he resolves of the two evils to choose the least: "and he said, This
   will I do, I will pull down my barns and build greater, and there will
   I bestow all ray fruits and my goods." But why could he not let the
   barns he had stand, and build more? No, that he did not think so well,
   he loved to see all his good things at one view, and what a goodly show
   they would make together. Besides that, it is the humour of
   covetousness, when it breaks out into expense, to over-do; the miser's
   buildings are like his feasts, always extravagant. The covetous man (as
   to the business of expense) is like a coward as to lighting, he
   declines it as long as he can; but when he is pushed to the last
   necessity, he grows desperate and lays about him.


   Tantis parta malis, cura majore metuque

   Servantur; misera est magni custodia census.

   Riches, which are got with so much trouble, are not kept without
   greater fear and care. A covetous man is in nothing more miserable,
   than in the anxiety and care of disposing and securing what he hath
   got. When a man's desires are endless, his cares and fears will be so
   too.

   Thirdly, As great an evil as any of the former, is, the vexation of
   having lost these things. If by any accident the man happens to be
   deprived of them, then he takes on heavily, hangs down his head and
   mourns, "as a man would do for his first-born;" and is ready to cry out
   with Micah, "they have taken away my gods, and what have I more?" Upon
   every little loss the covetous man is undone, though he have a hundred
   times more left than he knows what to do withal. So deeply are the
   hearts of earthly-minded men many times pierced with earthly losses, as
   with Rachel to "refuse to be comforted." Nay, St. Paul observes, that
   "the sorrow of the world sometimes worketh death/ (2 Cor. vii. 10.)

   Fourthly, But the saddest consideration of all is, that heavy and
   dreadful account that must one day be given both of the getting and
   using of a great estate. They that have got an estate by fraud and
   falsehood, or by oppression and grinding the face of the poor, may read
   their doom at large: (James v. 1-5.) "Go to now ye rich men, weep and
   howl for your miseries that shall come upon you; your riches are
   corrupted, and your garments moth-eaten; your gold and silver are
   cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and
   shall eat your flesh as it were fire: ye have heaped treasure together
   for the last days. Behold the hire of the labourers which have reaped
   down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth, and the
   cries of them which have reaped, are entered into the ears of the Lord
   of Sabbaoth; ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton,
   ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter."

   And we must be accountable likewise for the using of our estates. God
   gives them to us in trust, and the greater they are the more we are to
   account for; so much as we need is ours, but beyond what will support
   us, and be a convenient provision for our families, in the rank God
   hath placed them; all that is given to us, that we may give it lo
   others . and indeed it is not ours; we are the proprietors of it in
   respect of men, but in respect of God we are but trustees and stewards,
   and God will require an account of us how we have disposed of it.

   And can there be a more reigning madness among men, than to take care
   only to increase their account more and more by receiving much; whereas
   our great care and concernment should be to clear our account, by
   laying out what we receive, according to the trust reposed in us? How
   much we shall receive of the things of this world, is in the care and
   will of our Master; but our care and fidelity are seen in laying it out
   as we ought. Among men (says one) it is well enough if a steward can
   give an account of so much laid out, and so much in cash, and upon this
   he shall have his discharge: but we cannot this way clear our account
   with God; for it is not offering him his own again that will satisfy
   him, as we may learn from the parable of the talents. So that upon the
   whole matter, we should be so far from envying the rich, that we should
   rather envy the safety and happiness of those who are not en trusted
   with such dangerous blessings, and who are free from the temptations of
   a plentiful fortune, and the curse of a covetous mind, and from the
   heavy account of a great estate.

   I come now, in the last place, to make some application of this
   discourse to ourselves.

   I. Let our Saviour's caution take place with us, let these words of his
   sink into our minds: "Take heed and beware of covetousness." Our
   Saviour, I told you, doubles the caution, that we may double our care.
   It is a sin very apt to steal upon us, and slily to insinuate itself
   into us under the specious pretence of industry in our callings, and a
   provident care of our families: but however it may be coloured over, it
   is a great evil dangerous to ourselves, and mischievous to the world.
   Now to kill this vice in us, besides the considerations beforementioned
   taken from the evil and unreasonableness of it, I will urge these three
   more:

   1. That the things of this world are uncertain.

   2. That our lives are as uncertain as these things: and,

   3. That there is another life after this.

   1. The uncertainty of the things of this world. This should very much
   cool our affections toward them, that, after all our care and diligence
   for the obtaining of them, we are not sure to enjoy them; we may be
   deprived of them by a thousand accidents. This consideration Solomon
   urgeth, to take men off from an over-eager pursuit of these things:
   (Prov. xxiii. 5.) "Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for
   riches certainly make to themselves wings, they fly away as an eagle
   towards heaven." After we have sat brooding over an estate many years,
   it may all on a sudden, before we are aware, take wing and "fly away,
   like an eagle towards heaven," soaring suddenly out of our sight, and
   never to return again.

   And the same argument St. Paul useth, to take off men's affections from
   the world, (1 Cor. vii. 31.) because "the fashion of this world passeth
   away;" para'gei to' schema tou ko'smou tou'tou. He Compares the things
   of this world to a scene which is presently changed, and vanisheth
   almost as soon as it appears. Now, seeing these things are so
   uncertain, we should take heed how we fix our hearts too much upon
   them; we should not make love to any thing that is so fickle and
   inconstant as this world is. We should be afraid to contract too near
   and intimate a friendship with any thing which will forsake us, after
   we have courted it with so much importunity, and purchased it with so
   much pains, and endeavoured to secure it with so much caution and
   tenderness.

   2. Our lives are as uncertain as these things. If our estates remain
   with us, we are continually in danger of being removed from them. And
   (as one says) it is folly to build our hopes upon a match, where both
   parties are so uncertain and inconstant. Why should we place our
   dearest affections upon things, which we are sure not to enjoy one
   moment? "Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be taken from thee, and
   then whose shall those things be?" I remember Seneca tells us a real
   story, just answerable to the rich man in the parable, of an
   acquaintance of his, who by long and great industry had arrived to a
   vast estate; and, just when he began to enjoy it, after one of the
   first good meals which, perhaps, he ever made in his life, that very
   night his soul was taken from him; for presently after supper he died.
   In ipso actu bene sedentium rerum, in ipso procurrentis fortunae
   impetu. "In the height of his prosperity, and in the full career of his
   good fortune."

   But if we live to enjoy for any time what we have got, we should
   remember that our life is but a passage through the world, and that we
   are but "pilgrims and strangers in the world as all our fathers were,
   that we have here no abiding place, no continuing city," but are
   travelling towards our own country. And why should we load ourselves
   whilst we are upon our journey, and cumber ourselves with those things
   which will be of no use to us there, where we are going.

   But the great wonder of all is, that this vice should so strongly
   reign, and even grow upon men in old age, and get strength as weakness
   creeps upon us. This very thought, that we are to die, should work in
   us a great indifferency towards the things of this world. But when men
   are convinced they cannot live long, and that every step they take they
   are in danger of stumbling into the grave, this, one would think,
   should wean our affections from this world; and yet, usually, none take
   so fast hold of it, and embrace it so kindly, as old men; like friends,
   who, though they know they must leave one another, yet are loath to
   part. Do we not see many pursue these things with as much eagerness and
   appetite when they are leaving the world, as if they Mere to stay in it
   a hundred years longer? so that, in this sense also, they are children
   again, and are as fond of these toys as if they were just beginning the
   world, and setting out for their whole life.

   3. There is another life after this to be seriously thought on, and
   provided for with great care; and did men firmly believe this, they
   would not, with Martha, "busy themselves about, the many things, but
   would mind the one thing necessary," and, with Mary, "choose that
   better part," which could not be taken from them. They would overlook
   the trifles of this world, and scarce take notice of" the things which
   are seen," but be only intent upon "the things which are not seen;
   because the things which are seen are but temporal, but the things
   which are not seen are eternal." The great concernments of another
   world would employ their utmost care and their best thoughts.

   Whilst we are in this world, we should remember that this is not our
   home, nor the place of our rest; and therefore, as men do in an inn, we
   should make a shift with those indifferent accommodations which the
   world will afford us, and which we can have upon easy terms, without
   too much trouble and stir, because we are not to continue long here;
   and. in the mean time, we should cheer up ourselves with the thoughts
   of the pleasure and the plenty of our Father's house, and of that full
   contentment and satisfaction which we shall meet withal, when we come
   to those everlasting habitations.

   So that our great care should be to provide for eternity. If we have
   unbounded desires, let us place them upon such objects as are worthy of
   them. Let us earnestly covet the best things, and seek after the true
   riches. We should so mind the world, as to make heaven our great care;
   as to make sure to "provide ourselves bags that wax not old; a treasure
   in the heavens, that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither
   moth corrupteth," as our Saviour adviseth. (Luke xii. 33.) To the same
   purpose is the counsel of St. Paul: (1 Tim. vi. 17, 18, 19.) "Charge
   them that are rich in this world, that they be rich in good works,
   willing to distribute, ready to communicate, laying up for themselves a
   good foundation (or, as the word theme'lios may also be rendered, a
   good treasure) against the time which is to come, that they may lay
   hold of eternal life."

   I have told you, that all these things will fail in a short space; we
   shall either be stripped of them, or separated from them when we come
   to die, and shall look over to that vast eternity which we must shortly
   enter upon; this world, and all the enjoyments of it, will then be as
   nothing to us, and we shall be wholly taken up with the thoughts of
   another world, and be heartily sorry that the things of this world have
   taken up so much of our time and care, and that the great and weighty
   concernments of all eternity have been so little minded and regarded by
   us. Now seeing all these things shall be, pardon me, if I earnestly beg
   of you, in the midst of all your worldly cares, to have some
   consideration for your immortal souls, which are in no wise provided
   for by a great estate, but are designed for nobler enjoyments than this
   world can afford. When you are inking care to feed and clothe these
   dying bodies, remember that better part of yourselves which is to live
   for ever. Let not all your inquiry be, "What shall I eat? or what shall
   I drink? or wherewithal shall I be clothed?" But sometimes ask
   yourselves this question, "What shall I do to be saved?" I have an
   immortal spirit, it is but lit some care should be taken of that, to
   train it up to eternity, and to make it "fit to be made partaker of an
   inheritance among them that are sanctified."

   The firm belief and serious consideration of the great things of
   another world, cannot surely but cool the heat of our affections
   towards these dying and perishing things, and make us resolved not to
   do any thing whereby we may violate the peace of our consciences, or
   forfeit our interest and happiness in another world.

   II. By way of remedy against this vice of covetousness, it is good for
   men to be contented with their condition. This the apostle prescribes
   as the best cure of this vice, (Heb. xiii. 5.) "Let your conversation
   be without covetousness, and be content with such things as ye have;"
   arkou'menoi tois parousin, being contented with the present, and
   thinking that sufficient. A covetous man cannot enjoy tin present for
   fear of the future; either out of fear that he shall come to want, or
   out of a sickness and uneasiness of mind, which makes that nothing
   pleaseth him; but, if we could bring our minds to our condition, and be
   contented with what we have, we should not be so eager and impatient
   after more.

   This contentedness with our present condition doth not hinder, but that
   men, by providence and industry and lawful endeavours, may lay the
   foundation of a more plentiful fortune than they have at present. For
   provided a man use no indirect and dishonest ways to increase his
   estate, and do not torment himself with anxious cares; do neither make
   himself guilty, nor miserable, that he may be rich; provided he do not
   neglect better things, to attain these, and have not an insatiable
   appetite towards them; provided he do not idolize his estate, and set
   his heart upon these things; and if he can find in his heart to enjoy
   them himself, and to be charitable to others; nothing hinders but that
   he may be contented with his present condition, and yet take all fair
   opportunities, which the providence of God puts into his hands, of
   enlarging his fortune. It is a good character which the poet gives of
   Aristippus:


   Onmis Aristippum decuit color, et status, et res;

   Tentantem majora, fere praesentibus aequum.

   "Every state and condition became him; for though he endeavoured after
   more, yet his mind was al ways in a manner equal to his present
   condition."

   But if a man be discontented with the present, and restless because he
   hath no more, the whole world will not satisfy him; and if God should
   raise him from one step to another, he would never think his fortune
   high enough, and in every degree of it would be as little contented as
   he was at first. Our Saviour represents this sort of men by the rich
   man here in the parable, who, when his barns were full f and ready to
   crack, his mind was not filled; therefore he pulls them down and builds
   greater; and if he had lived till these had been full, they must have
   gone down too, and he would still have built greater. So that though he
   designed when he had raised his estate to such a pitch, to have set
   down and taken his ease, yet his covetous humour would have been
   stirring again, and still have stepped in between him and contentment,
   and for ever have hindered him from arriving at it.

   III. By way of direction, I would persuade those who are rich to be
   charitable with what they have. If God hath blessed us with abundance,
   and we would not be like this rich man here in the parable, we must lay
   out of our estates, in ways of piety and charity, for the public good,
   and for the private relief of those who are in want; for that is the
   apo'dosis, or moral of the parable; so "is he that layeth up treasures
   for himself, and is not rich towards God." So shall he be; such an
   issue of his folly may every one expect (to be taken away from his
   estate before he comes to enjoy it), who "layeth up treasures for
   himself, but is not rich towards God;" but does not lay up riches with
   God. How is that? by works of mercy, and charity. This our Saviour
   calls "laying up for ourselves treasure in heaven;" (Matth. vi. 20.)
   and at the 33d verse of this chapter, he calls giving of alms,
   "providing for ourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the
   heavens which faileth not:" they who do thus, who "are rich in good
   works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate/ are said to "lay up
   for themselves a good treasure against the time which is to come, that
   they may lay hold on eternal life," (1 Tim. vi. 18, 19.) Extra fortunam
   est quicquid donatur; "Whatsoever we give to the poor is safely
   disposed, and put out of the of fortune, because it is laid up in
   heaven, where we may expect the return and recompence of it." Charity
   to our poor brethren is a certain way of transmitting our riches into
   the other world to make way for our reception there. So our Lord tells
   us: (Luke xvi. 9.) "I say unto you, make to yourselves friends of the
   mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye shall fail (that is, when you
   shall leave this world and the enjoyments of it), they may receive you
   into everlasting habitations."

   At the great day of judgment, when we shall all appear before God, and,
   according to our Saviour's representation of the proceedings of that
   day, shall hear him thus expostulating with men, "I was hungry, and ye
   gave me no meat; thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; naked, and ye
   clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not;" what would
   we then give, how much of our estates, if we had them then at our
   command, would we not be willing to part withal, to have that
   comfortable sentence passed upon us, "Come ye blessed of my Father,
   inherit the kingdom prepared for you, before the foundation of the
   world!" But if we be found among those who would spare nothing out of
   their abundance to any charitable use and purpose; I have not the heart
   to tell you how miserable the condition of such persons will be, and
   how dreadful a doom will be passed upon them.

   It is a sad consideration, that there are some persons in the world who
   seem to be only defective in this duty; like the young man in the
   gospel, who lacked but this one thing to make him perfect; he had kept
   the commandments from his youth, and preserved himself from those gross
   sins which the law did plainly forbid; and yet, for want of this one
   thing, he parted from his Saviour, and, for any thing we know, fell
   short of eternal life. There are many who are very devout and
   religious, much in prayer and fasting, and all the other frugal
   exercises of piety, which cost them no money; but yet are very
   defective in alms and charity, which in Scripture are so frequently
   joined with the fasting and prayers of good men; and, by this means,
   all their devotion and diligence in the other parts of religion is
   lost, and will not bring them to heaven. And is it not great pity, that
   they who are not far from the kingdom of God should fall short of it?
   that they who in most other things bid so fair for heaven, should break
   with God upon this single point?

   I know men have several ways to deceive their own hearts, and to defend
   themselves against all these assaults.

   First, They say, they are injurious to no man in not being charitable.
   And it is true, that in human courts the poor can have no action
   against the rich for want of charity to them; but yet, for all that,
   they do injuriously detain that which doth not of right belong to them.
   They are cruel and hard hearted, and they are guilty of a high breach
   of trust in respect of God, whose stewards they are, and who hath dealt
   so liberally with them in the things of this life, on purpose to oblige
   them to be so to others. That which thou storest up, without regard to
   the necessities of others, is unlawfully detained by thee, since God
   intended it should have been for bread to the hungry, and clothes to
   the naked, and for help and relief of those who are ready to perish.
   For why art thou rich, and another poor; but that thou mightest
   exercise thy charity upon those fitting objects which the providence of
   God presents to thee? It had been easy for God (since "the earth is
   his, and the fulness thereof") so to have contrived things, that every
   man should have had a sufficiency, and have been in a moderate
   condition; but then a great many virtues would have been shut out of
   the world, and lost for want of opportunity to exercise them. Where
   then had been the poor man's patience, and the rich man's pity, and the
   contentedness of men of moderate fortune?

   Secondly, Men say that they have children to provide for. And do so, in
   God's name, for he al lows us to do it liberally; but unless their
   condition and wealth set them above an ordinary calling, do not choose
   so to provide for them, as to take them off from all employment, lest
   you put them in the ready way to be undone; have a care of leaving them
   no other business, but to spend what you have left them; if you do so,
   they will in all probability do that work very effectually, and make as
   much haste to be poor, as you did to make them rich. If men could be
   but contented to do that which is best for their children, they might
   do a great deal better for themselves, by disposing what they have to
   spare in charity.

   Thirdly, Others would fain excuse themselves from this duty, at
   present, by telling what they intend to do when they come to die; that
   is, when they can keep what they have no longer. It seems, then, thou
   wilt leave it to thy executor to do good in thy stead. This shews thou
   hast no great heart to the business, when thou deferrest it as long as
   ever thou canst. But why wilt thou trust another with the disposal of
   thy charity, rather than thyself? This is hardly to offer either a
   reasonable, or a living sacrifice to God, to do good only when we are
   dead. It is well that God hath made all men mortal, and that it is
   appointed for all men once to die; otherwise some men would never do
   good at all.

   Wherefore, setting aside these, and all other excuses, which will not
   be admitted, nor will any of us have the face to plead them at the day
   of judgment; I say, setting aside all excuses whatsoever, let us
   resolve to do good with what we have whilst we can; and to that end let
   us lay aside some portion of what God hath blessed us withal, for the
   uses of piety and charity, and let it bear some decent proportion to
   what God hath given us.

   There is never want of proper objects for our largest charity, and now
   less than ever. Besides these at home, which present themselves to us
   in great numbers every day, God hath sent us many from abroad, who call
   loud upon us for our pity and help, both as they are reduced to the
   greatest extremity, and are sufferers in the best cause, that of our
   common religion, which ought now to be dearer to us than ever. Let us
   shew mercy now, as we expect mercy from others, in any day of our
   distress in this world, and as ever we hope, whenever we come to appear
   before the judgment-seat of Christ, to find mercy with the Lord in that
   day.

   Consider what I have said upon this argument, and let this
   extraordinary kind of caution, which our Saviour here gives, make a
   deep impression upon your minds; "Take heed, and beware of
   covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the
   things which he possesseth."

SERMON XCI1I.

  RELIGION, OUR FIRST AND GREAT CONCERNMENT.

   But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and Ids righteousness; and all
   these things shall be added unto you.--Matt. vi. 33.

   IN the latter part of this chapter, our Saviour doth, in a long
   discourse, caution his disciples against an inordinate care about the
   things of this life, which he concludes with a strict charge to make
   religion their first and great concernment, and above all things to
   take care to secure to themselves the happiness of another life; "But
   seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness," &c. In the
   handling of which words, I shall do these four things.

   First, I shall explain what is here meant by the "kingdom of God, and
   his righteousness."

   Secondly, What by seeking of these.

   Thirdly, I shall lay down some necessary and plain directions, which if
   we observe, we cannot miscarry in this matter.

   Fourthly, I shall set before you some of the most proper and powerful
   motives and encouragements to the minding of this great interest and
   concernment: among which, I shall particularly consider the argument or
   encouragement here used in the text, "and all these things shall be
   added unto you."

   First, I shall explain to you what is here meant by "the kingdom of
   God, and his righteousness."

   I. What is meant by the "kingdom of God." And there are two famous
   acceptations of this phrase, and both of them very frequent in the New
   Testament. Sometimes it is used to signify the state of the gospel, or
   the Christian religion, which by the Jews was called the kingdom of
   God, or the kingdom of the Messias. (Mark i. 15.) "The kingdom of God
   is at hand;" that is, the state or dispensation of the gospel is now
   approaching, and ready to take place. (Luke xvii. 20.) The pharisees
   demanding of our Saviour, "when the kingdom of God should come?" that
   is, when the reign of the Messias should commence; he answers them,
   "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation;" that is, not with any
   temporal pomp and splendour, so as to draw the eyes of people after it,
   as the Jews did vainly imagine; but "the kingdom of God, ento`s umon
   estin, is among you," not within you, as our translation hath
   improperly rendered it; the kingdom of God (he tells them) is already
   come unto you, the Messias is among you, and ye are not aware of him.
   In the like sense this phrase is used, Matt. xxi. 43. "The kingdom of
   God (that is, the gospel) shall be taken from you, and given to a
   nation, bringing forth the fruits thereof." And so likewise the phrase
   of "the kingdom of heaven" is used, Matt, xi. 11. where, speaking of
   John the Baptist, our Saviour saith, that, "among them that were born
   of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist;" that
   is, there was no greater person than he, under the Jewish dispensation;
   "and yet he that is least in the kingdom of heaven," that is, under the
   dispensation of the gospel, "is greater than he."

   Now, though this sense of "the kingdom of God" be not wholly excluded
   in the text, yet there is another sense of this phrase very usual
   likewise in the Scripture, and which is more agreeable to the scope of
   our Saviour's argument and discourse; and so it signifies that future
   state of happiness and glory which good men shall be advanced to in
   another world, in opposition to this life and the enjoyments of it,
   which our Saviour had before forbidden his disciples to be so
   solicitous about. "Take ye no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or
   what shrill we drink? or wherewithal shall we be clothed?" And then it
   follows in direct opposition to this inordinate and solicitous care
   about worldly things, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness." That is, be not so solicitous about the conveniences
   and necessaries of this life, as about the happiness of the other, and
   the means to it. And this sense of this phrase of "the kingdom of God"
   is so very frequent in the New Testament, that I shall not need to give
   particular in stances of it.

   II. What is meant by righteousness; "Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
   and his righteousness." Righteousness, in the strictest and most proper
   sense of the word, signifies the particular virtue of justice; and very
   frequently in the Old Testament it is used for charity to the poor, or
   alms-giving: (Psal. xxxvii. 25, 26.) "I have been young, and now am
   old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging
   bread; he is ever merciful, and lendeth;" and, (Psal. cxii. 9.) "He
   hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness endureth
   for ever." But righteousness, in its largest and most extended sense,
   comprehends all the virtues of a good man; and so it signifies here in
   the text, and in many other places of Scripture.

   So that "the kingdom of God, and his righteousness," comprehends the
   whole business of religion our last end, which is eternal life and
   happiness in another world, and the way and means to this end; which is
   righteousness, or that universal goodness which God requires of us, and
   whereof he himself is a pattern and example to us; for which reason it
   is called "his righteousness." And in this sense of our last end, and
   the way and means to it, the kingdom of heaven, and righteousness, are
   used in another place, even of this sermon of our Saviour's upon the
   mount: (Matt. v. 20.) "Except your righteousness shall exceed the
   righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
   into the kingdom of heaven;" where righteousness is made the necessary
   means and condition of eternal life. I proceed, in the

   Second place, to explain what is meant by seeking "first the kingdom of
   God, and his righteousness/ And this signifies the greatest intention
   of mind, and earnestness of endeavour about the business of religion,
   in order to our attaining of eternal happiness, such a seriousness and
   earnestness of endeavour as earthly-minded men use about the things of
   this world. "For after all these things (says our Saviour, immediately
   after the text), do the gentiles seek;" ta` e'thne epizetei, which
   words signify an intense care and vigorous endeavour; "But seek ye
   first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;" that is, be ye, who
   profess yourselves Christians, as intent upon the business of religion,
   and the salvation of your souls, as the heathen, who are in a great
   measure ignorant of God and another life, are about the things of this
   life.

   And here are two things to be explained.

   I. What is here meant by seeking "the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness;" and,

   II. What by seeking them in the first place.

   For the first: A sincere and earnest seeking of "the kingdom of God,
   and his righteousness," does imply in it these four things.

   1. A fixed design and resolution as to the end; that we do not only
   propound to ourselves the eternal happiness and salvation of our souls,
   as our chief end, but that we be immoveably fixed upon it; and always
   have it in our aim and design; that here we set up our resolution, if
   it be possible, to be happy for ever; that we have this end always in
   our eye, and be firmly resolved to do all that we can towards attaining
   it.

   Not that we are obliged always actually to think upon it; but to have
   it frequently in our minds, and habitually to intend and design it, so
   as to make it the scope of all our endeavours and actions, and that
   every thing we do be either directly and immediately in order to it, or
   some way or other subservient to this design, or however not
   inconsistent with it; like the term and end of a man's journey, towards
   which the traveller is continually tending, and hath it always
   habitually in his intention, though he doth not always think of it
   every step that he takes; and though he be not always directly
   advancing and moving towards it, yet he never knowingly goes out of the
   way. And though he bait and lodge by the way, and does many other
   things which do not directly set him forward, yet they are all
   subservient to his journey, or in prosecution of it; or at least no
   wilful deviations from it. Thus it should be with us, while we are so
   journing in this world; our fixed aim and design should be to get to
   heaven, and thither we should he continually tending in our desires and
   endeavours.

   And if this resolution he deeply rooted and fixed in our minds, it will
   govern all our actions, and keep them steady to their main end.
   Whereas, if we he uncertain and unresolved upon our great end, and be
   divided between the happiness of the next life, and the present
   enjoyments of this, we shall be fickle and unsteady in all our motions.
   He that hath two ends, can pursue neither vigorously, but while he is
   moving towards the one, he leans and inclines to the other; and, like a
   needle between two loadstones, is always in a doubtful and trembling
   condition; inclines to both, but is constant to neither: and this is
   the meaning of that aphorism of St. James, "the double-minded man is
   unstable in all his ways." He that is unresolved as to his main end
   hath two minds, and ran prosecute nothing vigorously: but if our mind
   be once fixed and resolved, that will determine and govern all our
   motions, and inspire us with diligence, and zeal, and perseverance, in
   the prosecution of our end.

   2. Seeking "the kingdom of God, and his righteousness," implies
   incessant care and diligence as to the means; that we make religion our
   business, and exercise ourselves in the duties of it, both in public
   and private, at proper times and seasons, with the same seriousness and
   application of mind as men do in their callings and professions, for
   the gaining of wealth and preferment; especially on the Lord's-day,
   which God hath taken to himself, and set apart for the duties of his
   worship and service. Not that we are excused from minding religion at
   other times; but that those, who are pressed and straitened by the
   necessary cares of this life, may be sure to mind it then, and may have
   no colour of excuse for the neglect of it at that time, which God hath
   allotted for that very purpose, and which it is unlawful to employ
   about our worldly affairs. God expects that we should serve him at
   other times, that we should live in an habitual sense of him, and (as
   Solomon expresseth it, Prov. xxiii. 17.) "Be in the fear of the Lord
   all the day long;" so as to be careful not to offend or transgress in
   any thing, and so as to redeem all opportunities for the exercise of
   piety and devotion; but this day he peremptorily challenged! to
   himself, and expects we should employ it in his service, and dedicate
   it to religion, to the contemplation of God and heavenly things, and
   the care of our immortal souls, with the same seriousness and diligence
   as we do, upon other days, "labour for the bread that perisheth;" and
   the less leisure we have upon other days for this purpose, the more
   entirely should we devote and consecrate this day to the purposes and
   duties of religion.

   Not but that our whole life, and all the actions of it, should be under
   the government of religion, and directed by the laws and rules of it;
   and it should be our continual care and endeavour to please God in all
   things; and we should take as much pains, and be as heartily concerned
   to be good men, as the men of the world are to grow rich and great in
   this world; nay, so much more, by how much it is a better and nobler
   design to improve in grace and virtue, than to prosper and thrive in
   our temporal estate; and we do not in good earnest "seek the kingdom of
   God and his righteousness," if this be not our great study and
   endeavour, to subdue our lusts and govern our passions; and, in a word,
   to reform whatever is amiss in the inward frame and temper of our
   minds, and in our outward conversation. And, indeed, nothing does
   require greater diligence, and attention, and care, than for a man to
   become truly and thoroughly good, to be meek, and humble, and patient,
   and contented, and resigned to the will of God in every condition; to
   be peace able, and charitable, and placable, and ready to forgive:
   these are great and difficult things, and what ever we think, not the
   work of a wish, or the effect of a sudden resolution before the
   receiving of the holy sacrament; no, nor the fruit of frequent and
   fervent prayer, without the hearty concurrence of our own care and
   endeavour to render our lives such, as we pray God by his grace to
   assist and enable us to be.

   3. Seeking "the kingdom of God, and his righteousness," does further
   imply zeal and earnestness in the pursuit of this design; and this is a
   degree above diligence; for zeal is an ardour and fervency of mind in
   the prosecution of a thing for which we are greatly concerned, and
   which we vehemently desire to obtain; it is the hottest and most
   intense degree of our affection towards any thing of our desire and
   love, mixed with anger at every thing that stands in our way, and
   hinders us from obtaining what we seek after; such a heat as ambition
   doth commonly inspire men withal, in the pursuit of power and
   preferment. Such ought to be the temper of our minds, and the edge of
   our spirits, in "the kingdom of God," as does usually men in seeking
   the kingdoms of this world and the glory of them. We must remember,
   that it is a kingdom which we seek for, and aspire after; not like the
   unstable and tottering kingdoms of this world, but "a kingdom which
   cannot be shaken," as the apostle calls it.

   So that the greatness of the design, and the excellency of what we seek
   after, will justify and warrant the highest degree of a discreet zeal
   and fervour in the prosecution of it; and therefore no wonder that the
   Scripture, in this matter, useth words that import the greatest
   vehemency and earnestness, bidding us to "strive to enter in at the
   strait gate," to labour and watch, to run, and wrestle, and fight, and,
   in a word, to "give all diligence to make our calling and election
   sure."

   Lastly, Seeking "the kingdom of God, and his righteousness," does imply
   patience and perseverance in our endeavours after them, and that we
   never cease our pursuit of them until we have obtained them; and this,
   notwithstanding all the difficulties and discouragements, the
   opposition and persecution, that we meet with "for righteousness'
   sake:" for this we must expect and reckon upon beforehand, to encounter
   many difficulties and find many discouragements in the ways of
   religion; for "strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to
   life," as our Lord himself hath told us: nay, we must count to be
   grievously "persecuted for righteousness sake," and, if God see it good
   for us, to pass through many tribulations before we shall "enter into
   the kingdom of God;" and therefore we had need to be armed with a great
   deal of patience, and a very firm and obstinate resolution, to enable
   us to bear up, and to hold out against all these; for this is a
   necessary qualification for our seeking "the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness." So our Lord hath told us, (Matth. x. 22.) "he that
   endureth to the end shall be saved;" if we hope to receive the "crown
   of life," we must "be faithful to the death." (Rev. ii. 10.) And to the
   same purpose, St. Paul declares, (Rom. ii. 7.) that they only shall be
   made partakers of eternal life, "who, by patient continuance in
   well-doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality."

   You see what is meant by "seeking the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness; that is, let this be your main and principal design, so
   as to take place of all others in your esteem and affections, in your
   aim and endeavour; in comparison of this, mind nothing else, not the
   comforts and conveniences, no, not the necessaries of life, "what ye
   shall eat, and what ye shall drink, and wherewithal ye shall be
   clothed." These, you see, our Saviour instanceth in before the text, as
   not to be regarded and taken care of, when they come in competition
   with "the kingdom of God, and his righteousness." And our Saviour tells
   us elsewhere, that not only none of the comforts and necessaries of
   life are to be valued against him and his religion, but that even
   temporal life itself, as dear as it is to us, is to be parted withal,
   and given up, rather than to quit the profession of his truth and
   religion. (Matth. x. 37, 38.) "He that loveth father or mother more
   than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more
   than me, is not worthy of me." He instanceth in the nearest relations,
   those towards whom we have the most tender and relenting affections,
   and yet he tells us, that the consideration of his truth and religion
   ought to take place of these, nay, even of life itself; for so it
   follows, and "he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is
   not worthy of me." St. Luke expresseth it more strongly and vehemently;
   (Luke xiv. 26.) "If any man come to me (that is, take upon him the
   profession of my religion) and hate not his father, and mother, and
   wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life
   also, he cannot be my disciple." When these come in competition with
   our religion, and the great interest of our eternal salvation, we are
   to regard and value them no more than if they were the objects of our
   hatred; but to set aside all consideration of affection to them, so far
   as it would tempt us from constancy in our religion, and the care of
   our souls.

   So that when our Saviour bids us "first to seek the kingdom of God, and
   his righteousness/ his meaning is, that religion, and the concernments
   of our souls, and the eternal happiness of them in another world,
   should be our first and chief care; and that all other things should be
   made subordinate and subservient to this great design, and be no
   farther minded by us than they really are so: for that which is our
   great end, will subdue all other things, and bring them into subjection
   to it, and will reject them, and throw them aside, if they be
   inconsistent with it. If heaven be our utmost aim, and in order to
   that, it be our great study and endeavour to be righteous and holy,
   this resolution and design, sincerely entertained, will overrule all
   other considerations, and make all the things of this world to stoop
   and give way to that which is our chief end, the eternal happiness and
   salvation of our souls. And thus have I done with the second thing I
   proposed; namely, what is meant by "seeking the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness;" and what by "seeking them first."

   I proceed, in the third place, to lay down some plain rules for our
   direction and furtherance "in seeking the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness;" that is, in the great business of religion.

   First, Let us always live under a lively and powerful sense of another
   world: that we are placed here in this world but for a little while,
   and that wholly in order to our preparation for a better and happier
   life. Let this thought be often in your minds:--that eternity is the
   most considerable duration, and the next world the place of our
   everlasting abode, where we must dwell and continue for over; and,
   therefore, our present state is but of little moment and consideration
   to us, but only in order to our future and everlasting condition. We
   may please ourselves here, for a little while, with toys and trifles,
   with dreams and shadows of pleasure and happiness, and may be exercised
   with some troubles and afflictions for a short space, "for a moment,"
   as the apostle calls it; "our light afflictions, which are but for a
   moment;" and so, indeed, it is, compared with all eternity: but the
   substantial and durable happiness or misery remain for men in the other
   world, and will certainly be their portion, according as they have
   demeaned themselves in this world.

   Now, the serious consideration of this cannot fail to put us upon
   vigorous preparations for another world, and to make us wholly intent
   upon our eternal concernments, and to resolve, whatever becomes of us
   in this world, to take effectual care that we may be happy for ever. He
   that firmly believes the immortality of his soul, and a life after
   death, which will never have an end, must needs take into consideration
   his whole duration, and bend all his care and thoughts how he may avoid
   the greatest and most lasting misery, and secure to himself an
   immortality of bliss and happiness.

   Secondly, Let us always be under a conviction of the absolute and
   indispensable necessity of holiness and righteousness, as the only way
   and means whereby the kingdom of God is to be attained, and that
   holiness and happiness are not to be separated, the one being a
   necessary condition and qualification for the other; and, consequently,
   that it is the vainest thing in the world for any man to hope to enter
   into the kingdom of God, without endeavouring after his righteousness;
   there is so strong a connexion between them, that a man may as
   reasonably expect to be well and at ease without health, as to be happy
   without holiness; for this makes us like to God, and our likeness and
   conformity to God, is that alone which can make us capable of the
   blessed sight and enjoyment of God. We must be partakers of the Divine
   nature, in order to our participation of the Divine blessedness. And
   the consideration of this will effectually engage us to seek the
   righteousness of God, without which we shall never enter into his
   kingdom; and to follow holiness, "without which no man shall see the
   Lord."

   Thirdly, Let us always remember that righteousness is of a great
   extent, and comprehends in it all goodness; it takes in all the duties
   of religion, and the practice of all of them; it is a complication of
   all graces and virtues, of all the parts and ingredients, of all the
   duties and offices of a good man., To denominate a man righteous, all
   causes must concur; all the essential principles and parts of religion
   and goodness must meet together; knowledge and practice, faith and good
   works, right opinions and real virtues, an orthodox profession and a
   holy life, abstaining from sin and doing of righteousness, purity of
   heart and unspotted manners, godliness and honesty, the bridling of our
   tongue and the government of our passions, "and, above all things,
   charity, which is the bond of perfection."

   For righteousness is our conformity to the law of God, as
   unrighteousness and sin is the transgression of it. Now this, if it be
   real and sincere, will be uniform and universal, equally respecting all
   the laws of God, and every part of our known duty, and will not content
   itself with an especial regard to one or two precepts of the law,
   though never so considerable, and then allow itself in the neglect and
   violation of the rest; no, nor with the observation of the duties of
   one table of the law, if it overlook the other; no, nor with obedience
   to all the commandments of God, one only excepted. St. James hath put
   this very case, and determined it, that "he that shall keep the whole
   law, save only that he offend in one point, is guilty of all;" that is,
   he is not sincere in his obedience to the rest; and therefore, if we
   seek the righteousness of God, our righteousness must be universal; as
   he that hath called us is holy, so must we be holy in all manner of
   conversation, in the tenor of our actions, and the whole course of our
   lives: and anyone reigning sin and vice, any gross and notorious defect
   in the virtues of a good life, will spoil all our righteousness, and
   will effectually shut us out of the kingdom of heaven.

   Fourthly, Let us wisely subordinate the several parts and duties of
   religion to one another, according to the intrinsical worth and value
   of them, that so we may mind every part of religion in its due place,
   and according to the true nature and importance of it. Knowledge and
   faith are in order to practice, and a good life; and signify nothing
   unless they produce that; the means of religion, such as prayer and
   fasting, diligent reading and hearing the word of God, reverent and
   devout receiving of the blessed sacrament, are of less account and
   value than that which is the end of all these, which is to make us
   inwardly and really good, and fruitful in all the works of
   righteousness, which, by Jesus Christ, are to the praise and glory of
   God. And therefore, the means of religion, which I have mentioned, are
   to be regarded and used by us in order to the attaining of these ends,
   without which they are mere formality and hypocrisy; and, instead of
   finding acceptance with God, they are an abomination to him, and his
   soul hates them.

   And so, likewise, the circumstances of religion are less considerable
   than the substantial means and instruments of it. And, therefore, all
   rites and ceremonies are, in religion, of less consideration than the
   substance of God's worship, and ought always to be subordinate to it.
   In like manner the moral duties of religion, comprehended under the two
   great commandments, of the love of God and our neighbour, because they
   are of eternal and in dispensable obligation, are to be preferred to
   matters of mere positive institution; and where they cannot stand
   together, that which is positive ought to be set aside, and to give
   way, for the present, to that which is moral and good in its own
   nature, and not only because it is commanded and enjoined; for, in this
   case, God hath expressly declared that he "will have mercy and not
   sacrifice." Upon which ground our Saviour declares, that the law of the
   sabbath ought to give place to works of mercy. Upon the same account
   peace and charity are to be valued above matters of nicety and scruple,
   of doubtful dispute and controversy; because the former are
   unquestionably good, the latter doubtfully and uncertainly so.

   All these things ought to be considered, and are of great moment to
   make a man sincerely and wisely religious. For men may keep a great
   stir about some parts of religion, and be very careful and diligent,
   zealous and earnest about the means and instruments of religion, and in
   the exercises of piety and devotion, and yet be destitute of the power
   and life of it, and fall short of that inward, and real, and
   substantial righteousness, which alone can qualify us for the kingdom
   of God.

   The fifth and last direction I would give is this--That we have a
   particular regard to the great duty of charity, or alms-giving, this
   being very frequently in Scripture called righteousness, as being an
   eminent part of religion, and a great evidence of the truth and
   sincerity of our piety. And this our Saviour particularly directs to,
   as the way to the kingdom of God. (Luke xii.33.) After this general
   exhortation to seek the kingdom of God, he instanceth in charity, as
   the direct way to it: u Give alms, provide for yourselves bags that wax
   not old, a treasure in the heavens which faileth not." And else where
   our Saviour speaks of this grace and virtue, as that which, above all
   others, will make way for our admission into heaven: (Luke xvi. 9.) "I
   say unto you, make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
   unrighteousness, that, when ye fail, they may receive you (or ye may be
   received) into everlasting habitations." And St. Paul calls it, "laying
   up in store for ourselves a good foundation; or (as the word may better
   be rendered in this place) "a good treasure against the time to come,
   that we may lay hold on eternal life: (1 Tim. vi. 19.) St. James speaks
   of it as a main and most essential part of religion, and the great
   evidence of a true and sincere piety. (Jam. i. 27.) "Pure religion, and
   undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless
   and widows in their affliction." Finally, our Lord instanceth in this,
   as the very thing which will admit us into, or shut us out of, heaven;
   by the performance whereof we shall be absolved, and for the neglect
   whereof we shall be condemned in the judgment of the great day. (Matth.
   xxv.) So that this part of righteousness or religion, ought, in a more
   especial manner, to be regarded by us, because, upon the performance or
   neglect of this duty, our eternal happiness doth so much depend.

   The fourth and last thing only remains to be spoken to; which is, to
   set before you the most proper and powerful motives and encouragements
   to the minding of this great interest and concernment. But this will be
   the subject of another discourse.

SERMON XCIV.

  RELIGION, OUR FIRST AND GREAT CONCERNMENT.

   But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all
   these things shall be added unto you.--Matt. vi. 33.

   THESE words, which I began to discourse upon the last day, are a strict
   charge and command to all Christians, to mind the business of religion
   in the first place, and to take all imaginable care to secure the
   happiness of another life; "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and
   his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." In
   the handling of which argument,

   First, I explained what is meant by "the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness."

   Secondly, I shewed what is meant by seeking these, and what by seeking
   them first.

   Thirdly, I laid down some rules for our direction and furtherance in
   this great business.

   I shall now proceed to represent to you, in the

   Fourth and last place, some of the most proper and powerful arguments
   and encouragements, to engage us to the minding of this great interest
   and concernment; amongst which I shall, in the last place, particularly
   consider the encouragement here given in the text, "Seek ye first the
   kingdom; of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be
   added unto you."

   First, My first argument shall be from the worth excellency of the
   things we seek, "the kingdom of God and his righteousness," which are
   certainly the greatest and best things we can seek. "The kingdom of
   God" is the eternal salvation of our souls, everlasting life and
   happiness in another world, which, to animate our endeavours, and to
   tempt our ambition the more, are set forth to us under the notion of a
   kingdom. And what will not men do to obtain that? what pains will they
   not take? what hazards will they not run? what difficulties will they
   not grapple with and break through, if they can, to come tea kingdom?
   which, when they have obtained, they are exposed to as many, and
   commonly to more cares and fears, to greater difficulties and dangers
   in the keeping, than they were for the getting of it: and yet all this
   men will do for a corruptible crown, for one of the petty kingdoms and
   principalities of this world, which are continually tottering and ready
   to be overturned by open violence, or to be undermined by secret
   treachery. But "the kingdom" which I am speaking of, and persuading you
   and myself to seek after, is not like the kingdoms of men, and of this
   world; it is called "the kingdom of God," to signify to us the
   excellency and stability of it; as much beyond any of the kingdoms of
   this world, as the heavens are high above the earth, and as God is
   greater than man; "a kingdom which cannot be shaken, a crown which
   fadeth not away," a sceptre which cannot be wrested from us.

   But to quit the metaphor, and speak to the thing: "The kingdom of God"
   imports the eternal salvation of our souls; I say of our souls, which,
   both in respect of the dignity of their nature and I heir immortal
   duration, are infinitely more valuable than any of the perishing things
   of this world, and ought to be Hindi dearer to us. Other things art;
   without us, they neither constitute our being, nor are essential to our
   happiness; but our souls are ourselves, and the loss of them is our
   utter ruin and destruction. So that nothing is to be regarded by us
   with equal care and concernment as the salvation of our immortal souls;
   that is, that we may be rescued from eternal misery, and everlastingly
   happy in another world. And can we be at too much cost and pains upon
   such a design, to escape so dismal a condition, so dreadful a ruin, as
   that of body and soul to all eternity? Can any man be concerned enough
   to bring about so great a good to himself? or, can he purchase it too
   dear, whatever he give or part with for it? a good so desirable and so
   durable as our being happy for ever. When we purchase the things of
   this world, the riches and honours of it, at the expense of so much
   time, and care, and trouble, we pay dear for trifles and fancies; but
   eternal happiness is a jewel of so inestimable a price, that a wise
   merchant will have it at any rate, and sell all that he hath to
   purchase it.

   Of such value is "the kingdom of God;" and next to it is righteousness,
   which is the only way and means whereby this kingdom is to be attained,
   and therefore to be sought by us with the greatest diligence and
   earnestness: for that which is the only means to a great and desirable
   end, and which alone can make us capable of that end, and which in
   truth is a degree of it, is valuable next to the end, and almost
   equally with it; and such is righteousness in respect of "the kingdom
   of God;" it is the only means to it, it is that alone which qualifies
   us, and makes us capable of happiness; nay, it is an essential
   ingredient into it, and that which does in a great measure constitute
   the happiness of heaven; for that temper of mind, that conformity and
   likeness to God, which holiness and righteousness brings us to, is the
   true foundation of our happiness, and, according to the best
   apprehensions we have now of it, is the very formal cause and essence
   of our blessedness. So St. John tells us: (1 John iii. 2.) "It doth not
   yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when he shall appear, we
   shall be like him;" that is, we do not now distinctly understand
   wherein the happiness of the next life consists, we are not able to
   frame a clear and perfect idea of it; but this we know, in general,
   that it consists in our likeness to God, in a conformity to the moral
   perfections of the Divine nature, which are expressed by the name of
   purity and holiness; and therefore every one that hopes for the
   happiness of heaven must endeavour after holiness: "Every man that hath
   this hope in him must purify himself, oven as he is pure."

   So that the things which I am pressing you to seek after are most
   effectually recommended, by telling you what they are; "the kingdom of
   God" is eternal life and happiness, and "his righteousness" is
   universal holiness and goodness, without which no man is qualified for
   this blessed state. Now if there be any thing better than goodness, any
   thing more desirable than a happiness which hath no bounds, nor no end;
   do not mind them, nor look after them; but if there be not, then
   certainly these are worthy of the care and endeavour of our whole life.

   Secondly, Another consideration that should very much excite, and
   quicken our endeavour and diligence, in seeking these things, is the
   difficulty of obtaining them.. This, I confess, is no encouragement,
   but it is a very good motive and argument to whet our industry in
   seeking these things, when we plainly see that they are not to be had
   upon other terms. And this consideration our Saviour useth to quicken
   us to strive and to contend earnestly for eternal life: (Matt. vii.
   14.) "Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth
   to life, and few there be that find it." And, (Luke xiii. i24.) "Strive
   to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to
   enter in, and shall not be able."

   Seeking here, in opposition to striving;, is a faint and weak
   endeavour, which will not carry us through this narrow and difficult
   passage; and this is the reason why many miscarry, who made some
   attempts towards heaven; but they do not strive, they do not put forth
   any vigorous endeavours to get thither.

   Now the difficulty of attaining eternal happiness ariseth from the
   difficulty of the way and means to it; and it is then fore hard to
   attain "the kingdom of God," because it is hard to attain "his
   righteousness." As desirable as it is, it must be acknowledged very
   difficult for a man to raise himself to that temper and disposition of
   mind, so to subdue his lusts, and govern his passions, to bridle his
   tongue, and order all the actions of his life, as is necessary to
   qualify him for happiness, and to make him fit to be admitted into "the
   kingdom of God."

   And this difficulty is chiefly in ourselves, but greatly increased by
   temptation and opposition from without. Chiefly, I say, in ourselves,
   from the strong bias of our evil and corrupt inclinations, and the
   strong power of vicious habits and customs, which, when they are grown
   inveterate, do tyrannize over us, and make us perfect slaves, and lead
   ns captive at their pleasure; so that our nature must be quite changed,
   and, as the apostle expresseth it, we must be "renewed in the spirit of
   our minds," our souls must be new moulded and fashioned, we must be, as
   it were, created and born again, before we can "enter into the kingdom
   of God." In this our Saviour is positive and peremptory: (John iii. 3.)
   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot
   see the kingdom of God." This difficulty, indeed, is greatest at first,
   but it is considerable afterwards, until a thorough change be made, and
   new inclinations planted in us, and the contrary habits of grace and
   virtue be superinduced.

   And that which increaseth the difficulty is out ward temptation and
   opposition from the world and the devil; which to withstand and resist,
   requires great courage and resolution, great watchfulness and guard
   over ourselves. But yet, for our comfort, these difficulties are not
   insuperable to that grace and assistance which God is always ready to
   afford to us upon so good an occasion, and to so good a purpose;
   "greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world." And this,
   I am sure, is matter of great encouragement to us, that, though the
   difficulty of working out our salvation be great, yet, if we do in good
   earnest set about it, God is ready to assist and second our sincere
   endeavours, "to work in us both to will and to do of his own goodness,"
   and so to prevent us with his gracious favour, and to further us with
   his continual aid, that finally by his mercy we may obtain eternal
   life.

   Thirdly, Another powerful argument to care and diligence, is, the fatal
   danger of miscarriage in a matter of so great concernment. We may do
   many things in religion, and take some pains to get to heaven, and yet
   fall short of it. The rich young man in the gospel, our Saviour tells
   us, was "not far from the kingdom of God;" and he broke with our
   Saviour only upon one point--he was too much addicted to the world, and
   loath to part with his great possessions, and distribute them in
   charity to the poor; and thereupon he left our Saviour, and, for any
   thing we can find, never returned to him again.

   If the world govern and bear sway in our hearts, if we mind earthly
   things first, and make these our chief care and design, the kingdom of
   God and his righteousness shall not be added unto us; if we will not
   mind them in the first place, they are too good to be accessaries.

   And if upon any one point we miscarry, either out of love to the world,
   or affection to any other lust or vice that we are loath to part
   withal, our miscarriage is fatal, and the ruin which we bring upon
   ourselves irreparable; for the soul once lost, is lost for ever. If we
   have neglected the opportunity of working out our own salvation, while
   we are in this world, it will never return into our power again; death
   will shut the door against us, and we shall never see the kingdom of
   God.

   Fourthly, It is a mighty encouragement to us to consider, that, if we
   sincerely seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, there is not
   only a fair probability of obtaining them, but all the security We can
   desire. Men may be in good earnest for the things of this world, may
   love them with nil their hearts and souls (as we see too many do) and
   seek them with all their might and strength; and yet, after all their
   endeavours, may be shamefully frustrated and disappointed of their end.
   There are many examples of this kind daily before our eyes, and yet men
   are not discouraged from seeking these things. A fair probability, nay,
   almost a possibility of attaining them, is enough to a worldly-minded
   man to drudge and toil for them. Why, the same affection, the same
   zeal, the same unwearied endeavour to please God, and to save our
   souls, would infallibly bring us to heaven. It was a sad but true
   saying of Cardinal Wolsey, when he was leaving the world, "Had I been
   but as careful to please God, as I have been to serve my prince, he
   would not have forsaken me now in the time of my grey hairs."

   Nay, it is to be hoped, that less diligence and care about the
   concernments of our souls and another life, than many men use about the
   things of this life, will secure our eternal happiness, or else it is
   to be feared that but very few would be saved: and who would not place
   his industry, and endeavour upon a design in which he is sure not to
   miscarry, if he do but heartily and in good earnest pursue it?
   especially when it will be of infinite greater advantage to him, than
   any design he can propound to himself for this world. If a man may be
   certainly happy for ever, upon the same or easier terms, than he can
   ordinarily compass any of those little designs which men propose to
   themselves in this world, who would not seek that which is most worthy
   the having, and which he is surest to maintain?

   Fifthly and lastly, The encouragement here in the text is not
   inconsiderable; that if we "seek the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness, all these things shall be added unto us." This certainly
   is a very tempting consideration; for who would not be glad to
   reconcile the enjoyment of this world with the hopes of heaven and
   eternal happiness? But men do not generally like our Saviour's
   method--they would seek the things of this world in the first place,
   and get to heaven at last; they would be content to seek the one, and
   have the other cast in and conferred upon them without their seeking.
   But this will not be granted, this way will not do. And yet our Saviour
   has gone as far as one would think could in reason be desired; he hath
   promised, that if we will make religion, and the salvation of our
   souls, our first and chief care, that "all these things shall be added
   unto us." So that the design of going to heaven, and being happy for
   ever, is no ways inconsistent with a competent portion of the things of
   this life. Godliness (the apostle tells us) "hath the promise of this
   life, and of that which is to come." The business of religion, the
   practice of a holy and virtuous life, is no hinderance to a man's
   thriving in his temporal estate: nay, in many respects, it is apt to
   promote and advance it; by engaging us to diligence in our calling, and
   by deriving the blessing of God upon our honest and lawful endeavours;
   by obliging us to the strict and constant practice of truth, and
   justice, and fidelity, in all our dealings and commerce, which are the
   best way to establish a clear and solid reputation, and good esteem
   among men, which is an unspeakable advantage in business, and, at the
   long run, one of the best and most lasting instruments of prosperity
   and success.

   Besides that, religion frees a man from those passions and vices which
   do naturally tend to dissipate and ruin men's estates; as intemperance
   and lewdness, which are every way chargeable vices, and do not only
   take men off from business, and render them unfit for it; but waste
   their estates, and bring many other inconveniences upon their persons
   and families. Religion makes men meek and peaceable, and inoffensive in
   word and deed, which is a great security against chargeable suits and
   contentions, and all sorts of injuries and affronts from others. Among
   all the beatitudes of our Saviour, he only promiseth temporal happiness
   to meekness: "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
   They who provoke and offend nobody, are likely to be least disturbed
   and disquieted by others in their possessions and enjoyments; "Who will
   harm you, (saith the apostle, 1 Peter iii. 13.) if ye be followers of
   that which is good?" Some may be so perverse as to persecute a man for
   his goodness; but it rarely happens; most men have not only a kindness,
   but a veneration for true goodness.

   By all these ways religion naturally tends to the temporal prosperity
   of men, and the promoting of their welfare and happiness even in this
   world; besides that, the providence of God is very peculiarly concerned
   for good men, and a special blessing at tends them in all their
   undertakings. So that, excepting the case of persecution (which God
   will particularly consider and reward in another world), the religious
   and good man, who sincerely "seeks the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness," stands as fair, and is upon as good terms for all the
   lawful enjoyments of this world, as he that makes it his only design to
   be rich and great in this world; nay, as to the necessaries of this
   life, and a competency of outward things, he hath a much greater and
   better security from the providence and promise of God, than the men of
   the world have by all their care and pains.

   Besides that, he hath this considerable advantage, by minding these
   things only as accessaries, that, if he miss of them, he hath something
   better to support him in the want of them; being secure of a happiness
   which this world can neither give nor take from him. But now the
   worldly man, if he be defeated in his designs, is of all men most
   miserable, because he hath nothing else to comfort him, nothing else to
   trust to; he fails of his hopes as to this world, and hath done what in
   him lies to make his case desperate as to the other.

   Upon all these considerations and encouragements, you see how
   reasonable it is that we should make religion, and the concernment of
   another life, our great care and business. And yet, how are these
   neglected by the greatest part of mankind! and by the best of us (God
   knows) not minded as they ought, and as they deserve! What can we say
   for ourselves in excuse of so intolerable a folly? There are two or
   three things which men commonly pretend, if not in justification, yet
   in mitigation and excuse, of this great neglect.

   First, They pretend great difficulties and discouragements in the ways
   of religion. This I have already acknowledged to be true, so far as to
   awaken our care, and to whet our industry; but by no means to make us
   despond and give over all care of so great a concernment, because of
   the difficulties it is at tended withal. Men who have no mind to a
   thing, are apt to imagine great difficulties in the attaining of it,
   and to magnify them in their fancies beyond reason. As the people of
   Israel, when they were to enter into Canaan (which was the type of the
   kingdom of heaven), represented the inhabitants of the land, whom they
   were to conquer, more terrible than in truth they were; reporting to
   one another, that the land was full of giants, and sons of Anak, men of
   prodigious stature, and cities walled up to heaven. And this the wise
   man observes to be the perpetual excuse of the slothful; when they have
   no mind to a thing, they say "there is a lion in the way;" that is,
   they fancy to themselves dangers and terrors which are not. Thus men
   who are averse from religion, and have no mind to be at the trouble and
   pains to get to heaven, are apt to complain of the monstrous and
   insuperable difficulties of religion, and how hard it is for a man to
   mortify his lusts, and subdue his appetites, and govern his passions,
   and to do all those things which are necessary to bring him to heaven.
   Well! it is acknowledged to be difficult, and is it not so to get an
   estate, and to rise to any thing in this world? The true pains which
   men take about these things, shew that they are difficult; only when
   men have a mind to a thing, and their heart is set upon it, they do not
   stand to complain of the difficulty, but buckle to it, and grapple with
   it.

   Is religion difficult? And what is not so, that is good for any thing?
   Is not the law a difficult and crabbed study? Does it not require great
   labour, and perpetual drudging, to excel in any kind of knowledge, to
   be master of any art or profession? In a word, is there any thing in
   the world worthy the having, that is to be gotten without pains? And is
   eternal life and glory the only slight and inconsiderable thing that is
   not worth our care and industry? Is it fit that so great a good should
   be exposed to the faint and idle wishes, to the cheap and lazy
   endeavours of slothful men? For, what reason, nay, with what
   conscience, can he bid less for heaven and eternal life, than men are
   contented to give for the things of this world; things of no value in
   comparison, not worthy the toiling for, not sure to be attained by all
   our endeavours; things which perish in the using, and which, when we
   have them, we are liable to be deprived of by a thousand accidents? One
   fit of a fever may shatter our understandings, and confound all our
   knowledge, and turn us into fools and idiots; an inundation or a fire
   may sweep away and devour our estates; a succession of calamities may,
   in a few hours, make the richest and greatest man as poor as Job, and
   set him upon a dunghill.

   But be the difficulty what it will of attaining "the kingdom of God,
   and his righteousness," they are to be sought at any rate; because they
   are absolutely necessary, and we miserable and undone if we have them
   not. And therefore, not to dissemble in the matter, the difficulties of
   religion are considerable; but then they are much greater at first, and
   will every day abate and grow less, and the work by degrees will become
   easy, and turn into pleasure and delight: a pleasure so great, as none
   knows but he that hath it; and he that hath it, would not exchange it
   for all the sensual pleasures and enjoyments of this world.

   Secondly, Others pretend want of time for the minding of so great a
   work. And it is very true, that all persons have not equal leisure for
   this purpose; some are much more straitened than others, and more taken
   up with the necessary cares of this life; but God hath put no man upon
   this hard necessity, that for want of time he shall be forced to
   neglect his body and his health, his family and estate, to save his
   soul. And yet, if any man were brought to this distress, it were well
   worth his while to secure his eternal salvation, though it were with
   the neglect and loss of all other things. But those who are most
   straitened for time, have so much as is absolutely necessary; for there
   is a considerable part of religion which does not require time, but
   resolution and care: not to commit sin, not to break the laws of God,
   not to be intemperate, "to make no provision for the flesh to fulfil
   the lusts thereof," does not spend time, but saves it for better
   purposes; so that every man hath time not to do that which he ought not
   to do: and for the positive part of religion, whether it consists in
   the exercise of our minds, or in the external acts of religion, no man
   is so distressed, but he hath time to think of heaven and eternity;
   time to love God, to esteem him, and delight in him above all things.
   And this a man may do very frequently, and very acceptably, while he is
   labouring and travailing about his worldly affairs, while his hand is
   upon the plough his heart may be with God; and while he converseth here
   upon earth, his thoughts and affections may be in heaven. Every man
   hath time to pray to God every day, for his mercy and forgiveness, for
   his grace and assistance, for his preservation and support, and to
   thank him heartily for all his blessings and benefits. And a little
   time seriously employed in this kind, would have the same acceptance
   with God, as the more solemn and longer devotions of those who have
   more leisure and opportunities for them. To be sure, we have all of us
   time to serve God upon his own day, and to employ it wholly in the
   exercises of piety, and the care and consideration of our souls.

   But this, when all is said, is the case but of a very few; most of us
   have no colour for this complaint; Non inopes temporis, sed prodigi
   sumus (as Seneca says), "We are not poor, but prodigal of our time, and
   lavish it away profusely upon folly and vanity." Our vices and lusts,
   our pleasures and diversions, consume and divert those precious hours,
   which should be employed to these better purposes; nay, many times time
   oppresseth us, and is a burden to us, and lies upon our hands, and we
   know not how to get rid of it; and yet we choose rather to let it run
   waste, than to bestow it upon religion, and the care of our souls;
   insomuch, that I fear this will be the condition of many, that when
   they were at a loss what to do with their time, and knew not how to
   spend it, they would not lay it out upon that which was best and most
   necessary; for this surely is the very best use that can be made of
   time, to prepare and provide for eternity.

   Thirdly, Others pretend it will be time enough to mind these things
   hereafter. But this (as bad excuses seldom hang together, and agree
   with one another) directly contradicts the former pretence, which
   supposeth so much time necessary, and more than many have to spare; and
   yet now they would make us believe that a very little time will suffice
   for this work, and that it may be done at any time, even just when we
   are going out of this world. But this, of all other, is the strangest
   interpretation of seeking "the kingdom of God, and his righteousness"
   first, to put it off to the very last. This surely is a greater error
   on the other hand, to think that the business of religion is so quickly
   to be dispatched, and that the great work of our lives can be crowded
   into so narrow a corner of it, that the time of sickness and old age,
   nay, the hour of death, well employed to this purpose, will be
   sufficient. Alas! what can we then do that is good for any thing? that
   can in reason be thought either acceptable to God, or available for
   ourselves? When we have not sense and understanding enough to dispose
   of our temporal concernments, and to make our wills, do we think we
   shall be fit to repent of the sins and miscarriages of our whole lives,
   and to make our peace with God? Every man must not expect to have
   Saul's fortune, who, when he was wearied with seeking his father's
   asses, met with a kingdom. We must not think, when we are tired with
   pursuing the follies and vanities of this world, to retire into heaven,
   and to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
   heaven.

   Our Saviour hath taken care to caution us against this desperate folly,
   by a parable to this very purpose, of the foolish virgins; who, having
   trifled away their time till the bridegroom was coming, and neglected
   to get oil into their lamps (by which we are to understand all those
   good preparations and dispositions which are necessary to qualify us
   for the kingdom of God); I say, having neglected their opportunity of
   getting this oil, while they were looking after it too late, the door
   was shut against them; they thought to have repaired all at last, by
   borrowing of others, and supplying themselves that way.

   And thus many deceive themselves, hoping to be supplied out of another
   store, when they have no grace and goodness of their own; out of the
   treasure of the church, from the redundant merit of the saints, and
   their works of supererogation; of which some believe (I know not for
   what reason) that there is a great stock which the pope may dispose of,
   to supply those who have taken no care to get oil into their lamps. But
   I know not for what reason works of supererogation are supposed; the
   wise virgins knew not of any merit they had to spare; it was the
   foolish virgins only that entertained this senseless conceit. I am sure
   the parable insinuates the quite contrary; that the best and holiest
   persons (which are represented by the wise virgins) have nothing to
   spare for the supply of others, who have been careless of their souls;
   "the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are
   gone out; but the wise answered, saying, Not so, lest there be not
   enough for us and you; but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
   yourselves. It seems they had no works of supererogation that they knew
   of; but they do ironically send them to a market that was set up
   somewhere, and where these things were pretended to be sold: but how
   they sped the conclusion of the parable tells us, that, whilst they
   were running about in great haste to make this purchase of the merits
   and good works of others, the bridegroom came, and the wise virgins
   that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the rest were
   shut out.

   And there are those likewise among ourselves, who, having been careless
   to qualify themselves for the kingdom of God, hope to be supplied out
   of the infinite treasure of Christ's merits: but this also is a vain
   hope. For though there be merit enough in the death and sufferings of
   Christ to save all mankind, yet no man can lay claim thereto who does
   not perform the conditions of the gospel.

   Others think, by sending for the minister, when the physician hath
   given them over, to receive in a few hours such advice and direction,
   as will do their business as effectually as if they had minded religion
   all their lives long; and that a few devout prayers said over them,
   when they are just embarking for another world, will, like a magic
   wind, immediately waft them over into the regions of bliss and
   immortality.

   But let us not deceive ourselves; we may defer the business so long,
   till we shall get nothing by our late application to God, and crying to
   him, "Lord, Lord, open unto us," but that severe answer, "Depart from
   me, ye workers of iniquity, I know not whence ye are." If we would not
   have this our doom, let us "first seek the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness," that so, "having our fruit unto holiness, our end may
   be everlasting life."

SERMON XCV.

  THE WISDOM OF RELIGION.

   I have seen an end of all perfection; but thy commandment is exceeding
   broad.--Psal. cxix. 90.

   THIS psalm seems to have a great deal more of poetical number and skill
   in it, than at this distance from the time and age in which it was
   written, we can easily understand; the main scope and design of it is
   very plain and. obvious; namely, to magnify the law of God, and the
   observation of its precepts, as that wherein true religion doth mainly
   consist. And, indeed, if we attentively read and consider it, every
   part of this psalm does with great variety of expression, and yet very
   little difference of the sense, des cant upon the same ground; viz. the
   excellency and perfection of the law of God. And the words of the text
   seem to be as full and comprehensive of the sense and design of the
   whole psalm, as any one sentence in it; "I have seen an end of all
   perfection; but thy commandment is exceeding broad."

   These words are variously rendered and under stood by interpreters, who
   yet in this variety do very much conspire and agree in the same sense.
   The Chaldee paraphrase renders the words thus: "I have seen an end of
   all things, about which I have employed my care; but thy commandment is
   very large." The Syriac version thus: "I have seen an end of all
   regions and countries (that is, I have found the compass of this
   habitable world to be finite and limited); but thy commandment is of a
   vast extent." Others explain it thus: "I have seen an end of all
   perfection;" that is, of all the things of this world, which men value
   and esteem at so high a rate; of all worldly wisdom and knowledge, of
   wealth, and honour, and greatness, which do all perish and pass away;
   "but thy law is eternal, and still abideth the same;" or, as the
   Scripture else where expresseth it, "the word of the Lord endureth for
   ever."

   Thy law; that is, the rule of our duty natural and revealed; or, in a
   word, religion, which consists in the knowledge and practice of the
   laws of God, is of greater perfection than all other things which are
   so highly valued in this world; for the perfection of it is infinite,
   and of a vast influence and extent; it reacheth to the whole man, to
   the happiness of body and soul; to our whole duration, both in this
   world and the next; of this life, and of that which is to come. And
   this will clearly appear, if we consider the reasonableness and the
   wisdom of religion, which consists in the knowledge of God, and the
   keeping of his laws.

   First, The reasonableness of religion, which is able to give a very
   good account of itself, because it settles the mind of man upon a firm
   basis, and keeps it from rolling in perpetual uncertainty; whereas
   atheism and in6delity wants a stable foundation; it centres no where
   but in the denial of God and religion, and yet substitutes no
   principle, no tenable and constituent scheme of things, in the place of
   them; its whole business is to unravel all things, to unsettle the mind
   of man, and to shake all the common notions and received principles of
   mankind; it bends its whole force to pull down and to destroy, but lays
   no foundation to build any thing upon in the stead of that which it
   pulls down.

   It runs upon that great absurdity which Aristotle (who was always
   thought a great master of reason) does every where decry, as a
   principle unworthy of a philosopher; namely, a progress of causes in
   infinitum, and without end; that this was the cause of that, and a
   third thing of that, and so on without end, which amounts to just
   nothing; and finally resolves an infinite number of effects into no
   first cause; than which nothing can be more unskilful and bung ling,
   and less worthy of a philosopher. But this I do not intend at present
   to insist upon, having treated largely on the same subject upon another
   [1] occasion. I shall therefore proceed, in the

   Second place, to consider the wisdom of religion. "The fear of the Lord
   is wisdom," so saith the psalmist; it is true wisdom indeed, it is the
   beginning of wisdom, caput sapientiae, the top and perfection of all
   wisdom. Here true wisdom begins, and upon this foundation it is raised
   and carried on to perfection; and I shall, in my following discourse,
   endeavour to make out these two things:

   First, That true wisdom begins and is founded in religion, in the fear
   of God, and in the keeping of his commandments.

   Secondly, That this is the perfection of wisdom; there is no wisdom
   without this, nor beyond it.

   First, True wisdom begins and is founded in religion, and the fear of
   God, and regard to his laws. This is the first principle of wisdom, and
   the foundation upon which the whole design of our happiness is to be
   built. This is, in the first place, to be supposed, and to be taken
   into consideration in all the designs and actions of men: this is to
   govern our whole life, and to have a main influence upon all the
   affairs and concernments of it. As the first principle of human
   society, and that which is to run through the whole frame of it, is the
   public good; this was always to be taken into consideration, and to
   give law to all laws and constitutions about it: so religion is the
   first principle of human wisdom, by which all our actions are to be
   conducted and governed; and all wisdom which does not begin here, and
   lay religion for its foundation, is preposterous, and begins at the
   wrong end; and is just as if, in the forming of human society, every
   one in the settlement of the constitution, and the framing of laws,
   should have an eye to his own private and particular advantage, without
   regard to the public good, which is the great end of society, and the
   rule and measure of government and laws, and, in the last issue and
   result of things, the only way to procure the settled welfare, and to
   secure the lasting interests of particular persons, so far as that is
   consistent with the public good. And it would be a very preposterous
   policy to go about to found human society upon any other terms, and
   would certainly end in mischief and confusion.

   And such is all the wisdom of men, in relation to their true happiness,
   which does not begin with religion, and lay its foundation there: which
   does not take into consideration God and his providence, and a future
   state of rewards and punishments after this life. All wisdom which does
   not proceed upon a supposition of the truth and reality of these
   principles, will certainly end in shame and disappointment, in misery
   and ruin; because it builds a house upon the sand, which when it comes
   to be tried by stress of weather, and assaulted by violent storms, will
   undoubtedly fall, and the fall of it will be great.

   And this error every man commits who pursues happiness by following his
   own inclination, and gratifying his irregular desires, without any
   consideration of God, and of the restraint which his laws have laid
   upon us, not for his own pleasure but for our good. For when all things
   are duly considered, and all accounts cast up, it will appear, upon a
   just calculation of things, that all the restraints which the laws of
   God lay upon men are highly reasonable, and greatly for their benefit
   and advantage, and do not abridge us of any pleasure or happiness; but
   are wise and merciful provisions of heaven, to prevent our harm and
   mischief; so that we are not wise, if we act without regard to God, and
   his laws, and are not willing to be governed by him, who loves us
   better than we do ourselves, and truly designs our happiness, and
   commands us nothing but what directly tends to it. For the laws of God
   are not arbitrary constitutions, and mere in stances of sovereign will
   and power; but wise rules and means to procure and advance our
   happiness.

   And, in like manner, all that wisdom which men use to compass their
   worldly designs, of riches and greatness, without consideration of the
   providence of God, and dependance upon it for the success of our
   affairs, is all perfect folly and mistake. For though the design be
   never so well laid and vigorously prosecuted, and no means, which human
   wisdom can devise for the attaining of our end, have been omitted by
   us; yet, if we leave God out of the account, we forget that which is
   principal, and signifies more to the success of any design, than all
   other things put together. For if God favours our designs, the most
   improbable shall take effect; and if he blow upon them, the most likely
   shall miscarry. Whenever he pleaseth to interpose to cross the counsels
   and designs of men, "the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to
   the strong; neither yet bread to the wise, nor riches to men of
   understanding, nor favour to men of skill; but time and chance happens
   to all."

   So that it is great folly not to consider the providence of God in all
   our designs and undertakings, not to implore his favour and blessing,
   without which nothing that we take in hand can pros per. That which is
   principal to any purpose, ought to be considered in the first place,
   nothing being to be attempted either without or against it. And such is
   the providence of God in all human affairs; it is more considerable to
   the promoting or hindering of any event, than all things in the world
   besides; and therefore all policy, which sets aside God and his
   providence is vain; because there is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor
   counsel, against the Lord.

   So likewise all that wisdom which only considers and regards this short
   life, and the narrow concernments of it, and makes provision only for
   our welfare in this world; and therefore can only be tempted with the
   hopes of temporal advantages, and terrified only with the danger of
   temporal evils and sufferings; but hath no sense of an immortal spirit
   within us, no prospect of a life after death, no consideration of a
   happy or miserable eternity, of rewards and punishments, infinitely
   greater than all the temptations and terrors of time and sense: I say,
   all this is a preposterous and pernicious wisdom, and proceeds upon a
   false supposition, and a quite contrary scheme of things to what really
   is; and consequently, our whole life, and all the designs and actions
   of it, do run upon a perpetual mistake, and a false stating of our own
   case; and whatever we do pursuant to this mistake is foolish and
   hurtful, and so far from conducing to our true interest, that it is all
   either besides it or contrary to it; because we act upon a supposal
   only of this life, and a being only in this world, and that there is
   nothing either to be feared or hoped for beyond it; and being thus
   grossly mistaken, we set our hearts only upon temporal things, and
   study our present security and satisfaction; and, in all our counsels
   and actions, are swayed only by the consideration of temporal good and
   evil, of the present ease and pleasure, the disturbance and pain of our
   fleshly and sensual parts; without any sense of our own immortality,
   and of that everlasting state which remains for us in another world.

   But there is (my brethren) most certainly, there is another life after
   this; we are not beasts, if we do not make ourselves so; and if we die,
   we shall not die like them, neither shall our last end be like theirs.
   For whatever we may think or wish, it shall not be in our power to
   extinguish our own beings when we have a mind to be rid of them, and to
   choose whether or no we shall live for ever.

   And if this be a false scheme of things which we have framed to
   ourselves, and proceed upon (as undoubtedly it is), then our whole life
   is one great error, and a perpetual mistake, and we are quite wrong in
   all that we design to do. Our wisdom hath begun at the wrong end, and
   we have made a false calculation and account of things, and have put
   our case otherwise than it is; and the farther we proceed upon this
   mistake, our miscarriage will be so much the more fatal in the issue.
   But if our wisdom begin at the right end, and our case be truly stated,
   that God hath put into these frail and mortal bodies of ours immortal
   spirits that shall live for ever; and hath sent us into this world to
   sojourn here for a little while, and to be disciplined and trained up
   for eternity; and that, after a short proof and trial of our obedience,
   we shall be translated into an everlasting state of unspeakable
   happiness or misery, according as we have demeaned ourselves in this
   world; if we believe this to be truly our case, our interest is then
   plainly before us, and we see where our happiness lies, and what
   remains for us to do, in order to the obtaining of it, and what we are
   to expect to suffer if we do it not.

   Now this foundation being laid, it is evident, that the best thing we
   can do for ourselves, is to provide for our future state, and to secure
   the everlasting happiness of another life. And the best way to do that
   is, to live in obedience to those laws which our Maker and our
   sovereign hath prescribed to us; and according to which he will one day
   sentence us to eternal rewards or punishments.

   It is evident, likewise, that all our sensual appetites and desires are
   to be bounded by the rules of reason and virtue, which are the laws of
   God; and that no present ease and pleasure, trouble and suffering, are
   to be considered and regarded by us, in competition with the things
   which are eternal; and that sin is of all other the greatest evil, and
   most mischievous to our main interest, and therefore with all possible
   care to be avoided; and that the favour of God is to be sought, and the
   salvation of our souls to be provided for, at any pains and expense
   whatsoever, and even with the hazard and loss of our dearest interests
   in this world, yea, and of life itself.

   And now, if this matter hath been rightly stated, then religion and the
   fear of God is the first principle and foundation of true wisdom, and
   that which we are to consider, and take along with us in all the
   designs and actions of our lives; and all wisdom which does not begin
   here is preposterous, and will prove folly in the issue.

   Secondly, As religion is the beginning of wisdom, so it is the
   perfection of it; it is the highest point of wisdom in which we can be
   instructed: "The fear of the Lord (says Solomon, Prov. xv. 33.) is the
   instruction of wisdom." "A good understanding (says David, Psal. cxi.
   10.) have all they that do his commandments." The practice of religion
   is the perfection of wisdom; and he understands himself best who lives
   most according to the laws of God. And this I might shew, by instancing
   in particular virtues, the practice whereof is much wiser, and every
   way more for our interest, than the contrary vices; but this is too
   large an argument to engage in, and therefore I shall content myself at
   present, briefly to shew, that the chief characters and proper ties of
   wisdom do all meet in religion, and agree to it.

   The first point of wisdom is to understand our true interest, and to be
   right in our main end; and in this religion will best instruct and
   direct us. And if we be right in our main end, and true to the interest
   of it, we cannot miscarry: but if a man mistake in this, he errs
   fatally, and his whole life is vanity and folly.

   Another property of wisdom is to be steady and vigorous in the
   prosecution of our main end; to oblige us hereto religion gives us the
   most powerful arguments--the glorious happiness, and the dismal misery
   of another world.

   The next point of wisdom is, to make all things stoop and become
   subservient to our main end. And wherever religion bears sway, it will
   make all other things subordinate to the salvation of our souls, and
   the interests of our everlasting happiness; as the men of this world
   make every thing to submit and give way to their covetous, and
   ambitious, and sensual designs.

   Another part of wisdom is to consider the future, and to look to the
   last end and issue of things. It is a common folly among men to be so
   intent upon the present, as to have little or no regard to the future,
   to what will be hereafter. Men design and labour for this present life,
   and their short continuance here in this world, without taking into
   serious consideration their main duration, and their eternal abode in
   another world. But religion gives us a clear prospect of a life after
   death, and overlooks time, and makes eternity always present to us, and
   minds us of making timely provision and preparation for it. It takes
   into consideration our whole duration, and inspires us with wisdom, to
   look to the end of things, and to what will be hereafter, as well as to
   what is present.

   It is likewise a great property of wisdom to se cure the main chance,
   and to run no hazard in that. And this religion directs us to take care
   of, because the neglect of it will prove fatal.

   Another mark of wisdom is, to lay hold of opportunities, those
   especially which, when they are once past, will never return again.
   There are some seasons wherein great things may be done, which, if they
   be let slip, are never to be retrieved. A wise man will lay hold of
   these, and improve them: and religion inculcates this principle of
   wisdom upon us, that this life is the opportunity of doing great things
   for ourselves, and of making ourselves for ever; this very day and hour
   may, for aught we know, be the last and only opportunity of repentance,
   and making our peace with God: therefore "to-day, whilst it is called
   to-day," let us set about this necessary work, "lest any of us be
   hardened through the deceitfulness of sin;" to-morrow it may be too
   late to begin it, and the justice of God may cut us off whilst we are
   wilfully delaying it; and the opportunities of saving our immortal
   souls may vanish, and be for ever hid from our eyes.

   The next property of wisdom is, to foresee dangers, and to take timely
   care to prevent them. "The prudent man (saith Solomon) foreseeth the
   evil, and hideth himself;" that is, shelters and secures himself
   against it; "but the simple pass on and are punished;" that is, the
   evil overtakes them, and their folly is punished in their fatal ruin.
   Now, the greatest danger is from the greatest power; even from "Him who
   is able to save and to destroy:" "I will tell you (says the wisdom of
   God) whom ye shall fear: fear him who, after he hath killed, can
   destroy both body and soul in hell."

   Again, another main point of wisdom is, to do as little as we can to be
   repented of, trusting rather to the wisdom of prevention, than to that
   of remedy. Religion first teacheth men innocency, and not to offend;
   but in case we do (as in many things we offend all), it then directs us
   to repentance as the only remedy. But this certainly is folly to sin in
   hopes of repentance; that is, first to make work for repentance, and
   then run the hazard of it; for we may certainly sin, but it is not
   certain that we shall repent. And if it were, yet it is great folly to
   lay in beforehand, and to make work for trouble; Nae tu stultus
   homuncio es, qui malis veniam precari, quam non peccare, was a wise
   saying of old Cato: "Thou art (says he) a silly man indeed, who
   choosest rather to ask forgiveness, than not to offend." If a man had
   the best remedy in the world, he would not make himself sick to try the
   virtue of it; and it is a known comparison, and a very fit one, that
   repentance is tabula post naufragium, "a plank after shipwreck." But I
   am greatly afraid that thousands of souls, who have trusted to it, have
   perished before they could get to land, with this plank in their arms.

   The last character of wisdom I shall mention is, in all things to
   consult the peace and satisfaction of our own minds, without which
   nothing else can make us happy: and this, obedience to the laws of God
   does naturally procure. "Great peace have they (says David) that love
   thy law, and nothing shall offend them." "The work of righteousness
   (says the prophet) shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness
   quietness and assurance for ever." The fear of God, and the keeping of
   his commandments, is the best preservative against the troubles of a
   guilty conscience, and the terrifying apprehensions of a future
   judgment. And this is the great wisdom of religion; that whosoever
   liveth according to the rules and precepts of it, prevents the chief
   causes of discontent, and lays the surest foundation of a perpetual
   satisfaction of mind, a jewel of inestimable price, which none knows
   but he that has it, and he that hath it knows the value of it too well
   to part with it for the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season,
   and which always prove bitterness in the end, and, for the little
   sweetness which they yielded, leave a terrible sting behind them.

   Thus I have briefly represented the reasonableness and wisdom of
   religion. It is of infinite perfection, and of a vast influence and
   extent; it reacheth to the whole man, the happiness of soul and body;
   and to our whole duration, the happiness of this world and the next;
   for godliness, that is, true religion and piety, hath the promise of
   this life, and of that which is to come.

   But, now, where are the effects of true religion, in the full compass
   and extent of it, to be found? such real effects as do, in any measure,
   bear a proportion to the power and perfection of their cause? for
   nothing, certainly, is more excellent and amiable in its definition
   than true religion is; but, alas! how imperfect is it in the subject! I
   mean in us, who ought to shew forth the power and perfection of it, in
   the practice and actions of our lives, the best demonstration of the
   excellent frame and temper of our minds.

   What a conflict and struggling do the best men find between their
   inclination and their duty! how hard to reconcile our practice and our
   knowledge, and to make our lives to agree with the reason of our minds,
   and the clear conviction of our consciences! How difficult for a man,
   in this dangerous and imperfect state, to be, in any measure, either so
   wise or good as he ought! How rare is it for a man to be good-natured,
   gentle, and easy to be entreated, without being often betrayed into
   some weakness and sinful compliances, especially in the bad company of
   our betters! How next to impossible is it to be strict and severe in
   our lives, without being sour! to govern our lives with that perpetual
   caution, and to maintain that evenness of temper, as not to be
   sometimes peevish and passionate! and, when we are so, not to be apt to
   say with Jonah, "we do well to be angry!"

   There are two precepts in the New Testament, that seem to me to be the
   nicest of all other, and hardest to be put in practice. One is that of
   our blessed Saviour, "be wise as serpents, and innocent as doves." How
   hard is it to hit upon the just temper of wisdom and innocency; to be
   wise, and hurt nobody; to be innocent, without being silly! The other
   is that of the apostle, "be angry and sin not." How difficult is
   this--never to be angry but upon just cause! and, when the cause of our
   anger is just, not to be transported beyond due bounds, either as to
   the degree of our anger, or as to the duration and continuance of it:
   this is so very nice a matter, that one would be almost tempted to
   think, that this were, in effect, a prohibition of anger in any case:
   "be ye angry, and sin not:" be ye so, if ye can, with out sin. I
   believe whosoever observes it, will find that it is as easy to suppress
   this passion at any time, as to give way to it, without offending in
   one kind or other. But to proceed,

   How hard a matter is it to be much in company, and free in
   conversation, and not to be infected by it? to live in the midst of a
   wicked world, and yet to keep ourselves free from the vices of it? to
   be temperate in the use of things pleasing, so as neither to injure our
   health, nor to lose the use of our reason, nor to offend against
   conscience? to fast often, without being conceited of it, and
   bargaining, as it were, with God for some greater liberties in another
   kind; and without censuring those who do not tie up themselves to our
   strict rules, cither of piety or abstinence? when, perhaps, they have
   neither the same opportunities of doing it, nor the same reason to do
   it that we have; nay, perhaps, have a much bet ter reason for not doing
   just as we do: for no man is to prescribe to others his own private
   method, either of fasting or of devotion, as if he were the rule, and
   his example a kind of proclamation, en joining all his neighbours the
   same days of lasting and prayer which he himself, for reasons best
   known to himself, thinks fit to observe.

   And, then, how hard is it to be cheerful without being vain? and grave
   and serious, without being morose? to be useful and instructive to
   others in our conversation and discourse, without assuming too much
   authority to ourselves? which is not the best and most effectual way of
   doing good to others; there being something in the nature of man which
   had rather take a hint and intimation from another, to advise himself,
   and would rather choose to imitate the silent good example which they
   see in another, than to have either his advice or his example imposed
   upon them.

   How difficult is it to have a mind equal to every condition, and to be
   content with mean and mode rate things? to be patient in adversity, and
   humble in prosperity, and meek upon sudden and violent provocations? to
   keep our passions free from getting head of our reason, and our zeal
   from outrunning our knowledge? to have a will perfectly submitted and
   resigned to the will of God, even when it lies cross and thwart to
   ours, so that whatever pleases God should please us? to be resolute
   when our duty happens to be difficult and dangerous; or even to believe
   that to be our duty (though it certainly be so) which is very
   inconvenient for us to do? to hold out and be unwearied in well-doing?
   to be careful to preserve our lives, and yet, upon a great occasion,
   and whenever God calls for them, to be content to lay them down?

   To be wise and innocent; men in understanding, and yet in malice
   children? to have many great virtues, and not to want that which gives
   the great lustre to them all, I mean real and unaffected modesty and
   humility? In short,

   How difficult is it to have regard to all God's commandments, and to
   hate every evil and false way? to have our duty continually in our eye,
   and ready to be put into practice upon every proper occasion? to have
   God and the consideration of another world always before us, present to
   our minds, and operative upon our practice? to live as those that know
   they must die, and to have our thoughts perpetually awake, and intent
   upon the great and everlasting concernments of our immortal souls?

   These are great things, indeed, easy to be talked of, but hard to be
   done; nay, not to be done at all without frequent and fervent prayer to
   God, and the continual aids and supplies of his grace; not with out an
   earnest endeavour on our parts, a vigorous resistance of temptations,
   and many a sore conflict with our own perverse wills and sensual
   inclinations; not without a perpetual guard and watchfulness over our
   lives, and our unruly appetites and passions.

   Little do inexperienced men, and those who have taken no great pains
   with themselves, imagine, what thought and consideration, what care and
   attention, what resolution and firmness of mind, what diligence and
   patient continuance in well-doing, are requisite lo make a truly good
   man; such an one as St. Paul describes, that is, "perfect and entire,
   and wanting nothing;" that follows God fully, and fulfils every part of
   his duty, having "a conscience void of offence towards God and towards
   man." Who is there among us, that is either wise enough for his own
   direction, or good enough for the peace and satisfaction of his own
   mind; that is so happy as to know his duty, and to do it; as to have
   both the understanding and the, will to do in all things as he ought?

   After our best care, and all our pains and endeavours, the most of us
   will still find a great many defects in our lives, and cannot but
   discern great and manifold imperfections in our very best duties and
   services; insomuch, that we shall be forced to make the same
   acknowledgment concerning them, which Solomon does concerning the
   imperfection of all things under the sun; "that which is crooked cannot
   be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered." And,
   when all is done, we have all of us reason to say, not only that "we
   are unprofitable servants, having done nothing but what was our duty to
   do;" but have cause likewise, with great shame and confusion of face,
   to acknowledge that we have been in many respects wicked and slothful
   servants; and so very far from having done what was our duty to do,
   that the greatest part of the good which the most of us have done, is
   the least part of the good which we might and ought to have done.

   The practice of religion, in all the parts and in stances of our duty,
   is work more than enough for the best and greatest mind, for the
   longest and best ordered life, "the commandment of God is exceeding
   broad;" and an obedience, in any good measure equal to the extent of
   it, extremely difficult. And, after all, as the man in the gospel said,
   with tears, to our Saviour, concerning the weakness of his own faith,
   "Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief." (Mark ix. 24.) So the best of
   men may say, and say it with tears too, concerning every grace and
   virtue wherein they excel most; "Lord, I aspire, I endeavour after it,
   be thou pleased to assist my weakness, and to help me by thy grace
   continually to do better."

   The sum of all is this: if we be careful to do our best, and make it
   the constant and sincere endeavour of our lives to please God, and to
   keep his commandments, we shall be accepted of him: for God values this
   more than "whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices," more than "thousands
   of rams, and ten thousands of rivers of oil;" because this is an
   essential part of religion, "To love God with all our hearts, and
   minds, and strength, and to love our neighbours as ourselves." The
   duties comprehended in these two great commandments, sincerely
   practised by us (though with a great deal of imperfection), will
   certainly be acceptable in the sight of God, in and through the merits
   and mediation of "Jesus Christ the righteous." "Blessed are they (saith
   St. John very plainly, in the conclusion of that obscure book of his
   Revelation), blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may
   have right to the tree of life." (Rev. xxii. 14.)

   I speak now to a great many who are at the upper end of the world, and
   command all the pleasures and enjoyments of it; but the time is coming,
   and (whether we think of it or not) is very near at hand, when we shall
   see "an end of all perfection," and of all that is desirable upon
   earth, and upon which men are apt to value themselves so much in this
   world; and then nothing but religion, and the conscience of having done
   our duty to God and man, will stand us in stead, and yield true comfort
   to us. When we are going to leave the world, how shall we then wish
   that we had made religion the great business of our lives; and, in the
   day of God's grace and mercy, had exercised repentance, and made our
   peace with God, and prepared ourselves for another world; that, after
   our departure hence, we might be admitted into "the presence of God,
   where is fulness of joy, and at whose right hand are pleasures for
   evermore?"

   Let no man, therefore, of what rank or condition soever he be in this
   world, think himself too great to be good, and too wise to be
   religious, and to take care of his immortal soul, and his everlasting
   happiness in another world; since nothing but this will approve itself
   to be true wisdom at the last. All other things will have an end with
   this life; but religion and the fear of God is of a vast extent, and
   hath an influence upon our whole duration; and, after the course of
   this life is ended, will put us into the secure possession of a
   happiness, which shall never have an end.

   I will conclude this whole discourse with those words of our blessed
   Saviour, "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them." Which
   thou, who art the eternal spring of truth and goodness, grant that we
   may all know and do in this our day, for thy mercies' sake in Jesus
   Christ; to whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and
   glory, dominion and power, now and for ever. Amen.

SERMON XCVI.

  THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE PROMISES OF THE GOSPEL.

   Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that
   by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature.--2 Pet. i. 4.

   THE connexion of these words with the former is somewhat obscure, but
   it seems to be this: the apostle had, in the verse before, said, that
   "the Divine power of Christ hath, by the knowledge of the gospel, given
   us all things that pertain to life and godliness;" that is, by the
   knowledge of the gospel, w are furnished with all advantages which
   conduce to make men happy in the next life, and religious in this; and
   then it follows, "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and
   precious promises.--"Whereby;" this seems to refer to the whole of the
   foregoing verse; as if it had been said, Christ, by the gospel, hath
   given to us all things that conduce to our future happiness; and, in
   order thereto, all things which tend to make men holy and good. Or
   else, life and godliness are, by a Hebraism frequent in the New
   Testament, put for a godly life. And then, among all those things which
   conduce to a godly life, the apostle instanceth in the promises of the
   gospel, which do so directly tend to make men "partakers of a Divine
   nature."

   In the handling of these words, I shall,

   First, Consider the promises here spoken of; "Whereby are given unto us
   exceeding great and precious promises."

   Secondly, The influence which these promises ought to have upon us;
   "that by these ye might be made partakers of a Divine nature."

   First, We will consider the promises which are here spoken of; "Whereby
   are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises." And, because
   the chief promises of the gospel are here intended, I shall take
   occasion from this text to handle the doctrine of the promises, which
   is frequently discoursed of in divinity, but not always so clearly
   stated. And to this purpose it will be proper to take into
   consideration these four things:

   I. What the promises are which are here spoken of; "Whereby are given
   unto us promises."

   II. Why they are said to be so great and precious; "exceeding great and
   precious promises."

   III. We will consider the tenor of these promises.

   IV. When men are said to have a right to them, so as they might apply
   them to themselves. These four heads will comprehend what I have to say
   upon this argument.

   I. What the promises are which the apostle here speaks of; "Whereby are
   given unto us promises." And, no doubt, the apostle here intends those
   great and excellent promises which Christ hath made to us in the
   gospel. So that to satisfy ourselves in this inquiry, we need only to
   consider, what are the principal promises of the gospel. Now the great
   promises of the gospel are these three.

   1. The promise of the free pardon and forgiveness of our sins, upon our
   faith and repentance.

   2. The promise of God's grace and Holy Spirit to assist our obedience.

   3. The promise of eternal life to reward it.

   1. The promise of the pardon and forgiveness of our sins, upon our
   faith and repentance. The gospel hath made full and clear promises to
   this purpose; that if we believe the gospel, and will forsake our sins,
   and amend our wicked lives, all that is past shall he forgiven us, and
   that Christ died for this end, to obtain for us remission of sins in
   his blood. The light of nature, upon consideration of the mercy and
   goodness of God, gave men good hopes that, upon their repentance, God
   would forgive their sins, and turn away his wrath from them. But
   mankind was doubtful of this, and therefore they used expiatory
   sacrifices to appease the offended Deity. The Jewish religion allowed
   of no expiation, but for le gal impurities and involuntary
   transgressions, such as proceeded from ignorance and inadvertency; but
   not for sins of presumption, and such as were committed with a high
   hand. If men sinned wilfully, there was no sacrifice appointed by the
   law for such sins. But the grace of the gospel justifies us from the
   greatest sins, upon our faith and sincere repentance. So St. Paul tells
   the Jews: (Acts xiii. 38, 39.) "Be it known unto you therefore, men and
   brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of
   sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from
   which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses." There was no
   general promise of pardon, nor way of expiation, under the law; perfect
   remission of sins is clearly revealed and ascertained to us only by the
   gospel.

   2. Another great promise of the gospel is, the promise of God's grace
   and Holy Spirit to assist our obedience. Our blessed Saviour hath
   promised that "our heavenly Father will give his Holy Spirit to them
   that ask him." It is true, indeed, there was a peculiar promise of the
   Holy Ghost to the apostles and Christians of the first ages, which is
   not now to be expected; namely, an extraordinary and miraculous power,
   whereby they were qualified to publish the gospel to the world, and to
   give confirmation to it. But now that the Christian religion is
   propagated and settled in the world, the great end and use of these
   miraculous gifts is ceased: but yet the Spirit of God doth still concur
   with the gospel, and work upon the minds of men, to excite and assist
   them to that which is good. And though this operation be very secret,
   so as we cannot give an account of the manner of it, yet the effects of
   it are very sensible; and this influence of God's Holy Spirit is common
   to all Christians in all ages of the world. This proposition is
   universally true, and in all ages and times--"If any man hath not the
   Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."

   It must be acknowledged, that the Spirit doth not now work upon men in
   that sudden and sensible manner, as it did in the first times of
   Christianity; because then men were strongly possessed with the
   prejudices of other religions, which they had been brought up in; and
   therefore, as more outward means of conviction were then necessary, so
   likewise a more powerful internal operation of the Spirit of God upon
   the minds of men, to concur and bear down those prejudices, and to
   subdue them to the obedience of faith. Hut now the principles of
   religion and goodness are more gradually instilled into the minds of
   men, by the gentle degrees of pious instruction and education; and with
   these means the Spirit of God concurs in a more human way, which is
   more suited and accommodated to our reason, and offers less violence to
   the nature of men. So that this promise of God's Holy Spirit is now
   made good to us, as the necessity and circumstances of our present
   state do require. God does not use such extraordinary means for the
   producing of those effects, which may be accomplished in a more
   ordinary way. The assistance of God's Holy Spirit is still necessary to
   men, to incline and enable them to that which is good; but not in that
   manner and degree that it was necessary at first: because, the
   prejudices against Christianity are not now so great, and many of those
   advantages which were necessarily wanting at first, are now supplied in
   an ordinary way; and therefore it is not reasonable now to expect the
   same extraordinary operation of the Spirit of God upon the minds of
   men, which we read of in the first beginnings of Christianity.

   3. There is likewise the promise of eternal life to reward and crown
   our obedience. And this the Scripture speaks of as the great promise of
   the gospel: (1 John ii. 25.) "This is the promise which he hath
   promised us, even eternal life." And upon this account, the new
   covenant of the gospel is preferred before the old covenant of the law,
   because it is established upon better promises. All the special and
   particular promises of the law were of temporal good things, and these
   were the great encouragements that were given to obedience, under that
   imperfect dispensation: but now "godliness hath not only the promise of
   the life that now is, but of that which is to come;" as the apostle
   tells us, 1 Tim. iv. 8. The gospel hath clearly revealed to us a happy
   state of immortality after this life, of which men had but very obscure
   and doubtful apprehensions. So the apostle tolls us: (2 Tim. i. 10.)
   "That it is now made manifest, by the appearance of our Saviour Jesus
   Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality
   to light, through the gospel." Holy men had good hopes of it before;
   but they had no sure, distinct apprehensions of it, no such full
   assurance concerning it, no such clear and express promises of it, as
   the gospel hath given us.

   Thus you see what those great promises are which the gospel hath given
   us; namely, the promise of the free pardon and forgiveness of our sins,
   upon our faith and repentance; the promise of God's grace and Holy
   Spirit to assist our obedience; and the promise of eternal life and
   happiness to reward it. These are the three eminent promises of the
   gospel, and, in all probability, those which the apostle here calls
   "great and precious promises;" which brings me to the

   II. Second thing which I propounded to consider; namely, why they are
   said to be "exceeding great and precious, ta` me'gista kai` ti'mia
   epange'lmata, the greatest and the most valuable promises." And to
   satisfy us that they are such, the very consideration of the blessings
   and benefits that they carry in them will be sufficient: if we consider
   the condition that mankind was in, when God was pleased to make these
   gracious declarations to us, we shall see great reason to set a high
   value upon every one of these promises. Mankind was extremely
   degenerated, all flesh had corrupted its ways, and the whole world was
   guilty before God, and liable to all that misery which the sinner had
   reason to apprehend from the incensed justice of the Almighty. We had
   forfeited that happiness to which our immortal nature was designed,
   and, which made our condition more sad, we were without strength to
   recover ourselves out of it, by our repentance for what was past (if
   God would have accepted of it), and by our future obedience. Now the
   promises of the gospel offer relief to us in all these respects, and
   there by obviate all the difficulties and discouragements which mankind
   lay under.

   The gracious promise of pardon frees us from guilt, and secures us from
   the terrible wrath of God, which our guilty consciences did so much
   dread; and without this promise, mankind would have been under the
   greatest doubts and discouragements. For when men are afraid their sins
   are greater than will be forgiven them, they are apt to fall into
   despair, and despair is an effectual bar to repentance; for when men
   think their condition is desperate, they care not what they do.

   And the promise of God's grace and Holy Spirit, to assist and enable us
   to do our duty, does fully answer all the discouragements and
   objections from our own weakness, and the power of temptation. We may
   do all things through Christ strengthening us: and how weak soever we
   are of ourselves, we are "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
   might." If God be for us, who, or what, can stand against us? The devil
   is a very powerful enemy, and much too strong for flesh and blood to
   encounter in its own strength; but there is another principle in the
   world, which is mightier and more powerful than he, the Holy Spirit of
   God, who is always ready to help, when we do not repulse and refuse his
   assistance; "Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the
   world," says the apostle, 1 John iv. 4. The Spirit of God dwells in all
   those who are willing to admit him, and is ever ready to assist those
   who comply with his blessed motions, and do vigorously put forth their
   own endeavours.

   And then the promise of eternal life, that answers all the difficulties
   of our obedience, and sets us above any thing that the world can
   threaten us withal, for our constancy to God and his truth. A wise man
   will be content to suffer any thing, or to quit any thing, upon terms
   of far greater advantage: and what greater consideration can be offered
   to encourage our constancy and obedience, than an eternity of
   happiness? So that the apostle had reason to call these "exceeding
   great and valuable promises;" so valuable, that if any one of them had
   been wanting, our redemption and recovery had either been absolutely
   impossible, or extremely difficult. I proceed to the

   III. Third thing I propounded, which was to consider the tenour of
   these promises; that is, whether God hath made them absolutely to us,
   with out requiring any thing to be done on our part, or upon certain
   terms and conditions to be performed by us. That God may (if he please)
   make an absolute promise of any blessing or benefit to us, there is no
   doubt; and that find's grace does prevent many, and is beforehand with
   them, is as little to be doubted: the Spirit of God goes along with the
   gospel, moving and inclining men to yield obedience to it, many times
   before any inclination and disposition thereto on their parts. But as
   to this promise of God's grace and Holy Spirit, the great question is,
   not about the first motion of it, but the continuance of this
   assistance, and the increase of it; and this, I think, may safely be
   affirmed, is promised only conditionally, as also the pardon of sin,
   and eternal life. And concerning each of these, the matter may quickly
   be decided, by plain texts of Scripture.

   Concerning the promise of the grace and assistance of God's Holy
   Spirit, the Scripture takes notice of two conditions. First, That we
   beg it earnestly of God: and this our Saviour expresseth by asking,
   seeking, and knocking, which signifies the importunity of our requests;
   our heavenly Father will give his Holy Spirit to them that thus ask it.
   And then, secondly, That we improve and make use of the grace which God
   affords us: "To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath
   not shall be taken away, even that which he seems to have." That is (as
   appears plainly from the scope of the parable), to him that useth that
   grace and those advantages which God affords him, more shall be given;
   but from him that makes no use of them, and, therefore, is as if he had
   them not, shall be taken away that which he but seems to have, because
   he makes no use of it.

   Concerning the pardon of sins: the Scripture plainly suspends that upon
   the general condition of repentance, and the change of our lives;
   "Repent, that your sins may be forgiven you:" and upon the condition of
   our forgiving others; "If ye forgive men their trespasses, then will
   your heavenly Father also forgive you; but if you forgive not men their
   trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses," says our
   Saviour. (Matt. vi. 14, 15.)

   And then the promise of eternal life, is every where in Scripture
   suspended upon the condition of faith and repentance, and perseverance
   in well-doing. "He that believes (says our Saviour) shall be saved;"
   which, indeed, implies the whole condition of the gospel. "He that
   believes;" that is, he that effectually assents to the doctrine of
   Christ, and is so persuaded of the truth of it, as to live according to
   it, shall be saved. But if obedience were not included in the Scripture
   notion of faith, yet the Scripture elsewhere expressly makes it the
   condition of our eternal salvation. (Heb. v. 9.) Christ is there said
   to be "the author of eternal salvation to them that obey him;" thereby
   implying, that none shall be saved by Christ, but those that obey the
   gospel. (Heb. xii. 14.) . "Follow holiness, without which no man shall
   see the Lord." (Rom. ii. 7, 8, 9.) "To them who by patient continuance
   in well-doing seek for glory, and honour, and immortality," God will
   give "eternal life; but to them that are contentious, and obey not the
   truth (that is the gospel), but obey unrighteousness, indignation and
   wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth
   evil."

   I cannot well imagine what can reasonably be answered to such plain
   texts; but I will tell you what is commonly answered; namely, that God
   gives the condition which he requires, and therefore, though these
   promises run into a conditional form, yet in truth they are absolute;
   because he that makes a promise to another, upon a condition which he
   will also perform, doth in effect make an absolute promise. As if a man
   promised another such an estate, upon condition he pay such a sum for
   it, and does promise withal to furnish him with that sum, this in
   effect amounts to an absolute promise of the estate.

   And this is very well argued, if the case were thus. Hut God hath no
   where, promised to work the condition in us without the concurrence of
   our own endeavours. God may, and oftentimes doth, prevent men by his
   grace; but he hath no where promised to give his Holy Spirit but to
   them that ask it of him. And he hath no where promised to continue his
   grace and assistance to us, unless we will use our sincere endeavours;
   nay, in case we do not, he hath threatened to take away his grace and
   assistance from us. And if this be so, then the promises of the gospel
   do not only seem to be conditional, but are really so. And it is a
   wonder that any man should doubt of this, who considers how frequently,
   in the New Testament, the gospel is represented to us under the notion
   of a covenant; such a covenant, in the very nature of it, doth imply a
   mutual obligation between the parties that enter into it. But if the
   gospel contain only blessings which are promised on God's part, without
   any thing required to be done and performed on our part, in order to
   the obtaining of those blessings, then the gospel is nothing else but a
   promise, or deed of gift, making over certain benefits and blessings to
   us; but can, in no propriety of language in the world, be called a
   covenant: but if there be some things required on our part, in order to
   our being made partakers of the promises which God hath made to us (as
   the Scripture every where tells us there is), then the promises are
   plainly conditional. To instance in the promise of forgiveness of sins;
   "Repent, that your sins may be blotted out;" that is, upon this
   condition, that ye repent of your sins, they shall be forgiven, and not
   otherwise. Can there be any plainer condition in the world than this,
   in those words of our Saviour? "If ye forgive men their trespasses,
   your heavenly Father will also forgive your trespasses; but if ye
   forgive not their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive
   your trespasses."

   This is so far from being any prejudice to the freeness of God's grace,
   who is infinitely gracious in offering such great blessings to us upon
   any condition that we can perform; that it were one of the absurdest
   things in the world, to imagine that God should grant to men
   forgiveness of sins and eternal life, let them behave themselves as
   they will.

   IV. The last thing I proposed for the explaining of this doctrine of
   the promises of God, was, to consider when men may be said to have a
   right to these promises, so as to be able upon good grounds to apply
   them to themselves: and the answer to this is very plain and easy;
   namely, when they find the conditions of these promises in themselves,
   and not till then.

   When a man hath truly repented of his sins so as to forsake them, and
   lead a new life; and when he does from his heart forgive those that
   have offended him, and hath laid down all animosity against them, and
   thoughts of revenge; then hath he a right to the promise of pardon and
   forgiveness, and may apply to himself in particular what the Scripture
   saith in general, that God will "blot out all his transgressions, and
   remember his iniquities no more." When a man doth constantly and
   earnestly implore the assistance of God's Holy Spirit, and is ready to
   yield to the motions of it, and does faithfully make use of that
   strength and assistance which God affords him, then he may expect the
   continuance of his grace, and further degrees of it. When a man makes
   it the constant and sincere endeavour of his life, to please God, and
   to walk in all the ordinances and commandments of the Lord blameless,"
   and is effectually taught by the grace of God to "deny ungodliness and
   worldly lusts, and to live soberly, and righteously, and godly in this
   present world," then he may with comfort and joy "wait for the blessed
   hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour
   Jesus Christ;" then he may with confidence depend upon God, "in sure
   and certain hope of that eternal life which God, that cannot lie, hath
   promised." When he can say with St. Paul, "I have fought a good fight,
   I have finished my course, I have kept the faith;" then he may likewise
   triumph as he did, "henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
   righteousness, which God the righteous Judge shall give me in that
   day."

   Upon these terms, and in these cases, men may upon good grounds apply
   to themselves "these exceeding great and precious promises" of the
   gospel; and so far as any man is doubtful and uncertain of the
   performance of the conditions which the gospel requires, so far he must
   necessarily question his right and title to the blessings promised. And
   if any man think this doctrine too uncomfortable, and be willing to
   reject it upon this account, I shall only say this, that men may cheat
   themselves if they please, but most certainly they will never find any
   true and solid comfort in any other. This is a plain and sensible
   account of a man's confidence and good hopes in the promises of God;
   but for a man to apply any promise to himself, before he finds the
   condition in himself, is not faith, but either fancy or presumption.

   And, therefore, it is a very preposterous course which many take, to
   advise and exhort men, with so much earnestness, to apply the promises
   of God to themselves, and to tell them that they are guilty of great
   unbelief in not doing it. That which is proper to exhort men to is, to
   endeavour to perform the condition upon which God hath promised any
   blessing to us; and when men find the condition in themselves, they
   will, without any great persuasion, take comfort from the promise, and
   apply it to themselves; but till they discern the condition in
   themselves, it is impossible for a man that understands himself to
   apply the promise to himself; for till the condition be performed, he
   hath no more right to the promise than if such a promise had never been
   made. And it is so far from being a sin in such a man to doubt of the
   benefit of such a promise, that it is his duty to do so; and no man
   that understands himself and the promises of God can possibly do
   otherwise.

   Therefore, it is a vain and groundless trouble which perplexeth many
   people, that they cannot apply the promises of God to themselves;
   whereas, the true ground of their trouble should be this, that they
   have not been careful to perform the condition of those promises which
   they would apply to themselves: the other is an endless trouble; let
   them but look to the condition, and the promise will apply itself. I
   speak all this on purpose to free men from those perplexities wherewith
   many have entangled themselves by false apprehensions of the promises
   of God, either as if they were not made to us upon certain conditions
   to be performed by us, or as if any man could comfortably apply them to
   himself, before he hath performed those conditions, upon which God hath
   made such promises. For if men will believe that which is not true, or
   expect things upon such terms as they are not to be had, they may
   trouble themselves eternally, and all the world cannot help it.

   I have now done with the first thing I propounded to speak to; namely,
   the promises which are here spoken of. The second thing (viz.) what
   influence these promises ought to have upon us, "that by them we may be
   made partakers of the Divine nature," I shall reserve to another
   opportunity.

SERMON XCVII.

  THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF THE PROMISES OF THE GOSPEL.

   Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that
   by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature.--2 Pet. i. 4.

   I MADE entrance into these words the last day, in the handling whereof
   I proposed to do these two things:--

   First, To consider the promises here spoken of: "Whereby are given unto
   us exceeding great and precious promises."

   Secondly, The influence which these promises Ought to have upon us:
   "that by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature."

   The first of these I have done with, and proceed now to the

   Second, viz. The influence which these promises ought to have upon us:
   "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that
   by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature." Not that we can
   partake of the essence and nature of God, as some have blasphemously
   affirmed, pretending, in their canting and senseless language, to be
   Godded with God and Christed with Christ. In this sense it is
   impossible for us to "partake of the Divine nature;" for this would be
   for men to become gods, and to be advanced to the state and perfection
   of the Deity. But the word phu'sis doth frequently, in Scripture,
   signify a temper and disposition; and to be "partakers of a Divine
   nature" is to be of a Divine temper and disposition, to have our
   corrupt natures rectified and purged from all sinful lusts and
   irregular passions, and from all vicious and corrupt affections; and
   therefore it follows in the text: "Having escaped the corruption that
   is in the world through lust; and, besides this, giving all diligence,
   add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge
   temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and
   to godliness brotherly-kindness, and to brotherly-kindness charity." So
   that we are "made partakers of a Divine nature," as the apostle here
   explains it, these two ways: by cleansing ourselves from the lusts of
   the flesh, which the apostle here calls the "corruption or defilement
   which is in the world through lust;" and by a diligent endeavour after
   all Christian graces and virtues, faith, and temperance, and patience,
   a sincere love of the brethren, and an universal charity and good-will
   towards all men.

   And that this is the proper influence and efficacy of the great
   promises of the gospel upon the hearts and lives of men, the apostle
   St. Paul fully declares to us: (2 Cor. vii. 1.) "Having, therefore,
   these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all
   filthiness of the flesh and spirit;" that is, from the lusts of the
   flesh, and of uncleanness, and from all evil and corrupt affections of
   the mind, such as wrath, envy, malice, hatred, strife, revenge,
   cruelty, pride, and the like; "perfecting holiness in the fear of God;"
   that is, continually aspiring still more and more after further degrees
   of holiness, and virtue, and goodness, which are the great perfections
   of the Divine nature. And thus, by a constant and sincere endeavour "to
   cleanse ourselves from all impurity of flesh and spirit," and by
   "practising all the virtues of a good life," we shall, by degrees,
   raise and advance ourselves to a godlike temper and disposition,
   imitating in all our actions the goodness, and mercy, and patience, and
   truth, and faithfulness of God, and all those other perfections of the
   Divine nature, which are comprehended under the term of holiness. This
   is that which the apostle here calls "partaking of a Divine nature;"
   or, as our blessed Saviour expresseth it, "to he perfect, as our Father
   which is in heaven is perfect."

   This the gospel designs to raise us to; and one of the great
   instruments whereby this is effected, are those "exceeding great and
   precious promises" which I have insisted upon; and they are capable of
   (fleeting it these two ways:--

   First, By way of internal efficacy and assistance; and,

   Secondly, By way of external motive and argument: both these ways some
   or other of these promises have a mighty influence upon us (if we he
   not wanting to ourselves) to raise us to a godlike temper and
   disposition; that is, to the greatest perfection of virtue and goodness
   which we are capable of in this life.

   First, By way of internal efficacy and assistance. And this influence
   the promise of God's Holy Spirit, and of his gracious help and
   assistance thereof, hath upon the minds of men, inclining them to that
   which is good, and enabling them to do it. For the Holy Spirit is
   promised to us, in consideration and commiseration of that impotency
   and weakness which we have contracted in that degenerate and depraved
   condition into which mankind is sunk; to help us, who are without
   strength, to recover ourselves out of that evil and miserable state
   into which, by wilful transgression, we are fallen; to "quicken us who
   are dead in trespasses and sins (as the Scripture expresseth the
   condition of unregenerate persons), to raise us to a new life," and to
   cherish this principle of spiritual life, which is commonly weak at
   first, and to carry it through all discouragements and oppositions; to
   excite us continually to our duty, and to enable us to the most
   difficult parts of obedience, such as are most contrary to our natural
   inclinations, and against the grain of flesh and blood; to bear down
   the strength of sin and temptation; and in all our conflicts with the
   world, the flesh, and the devil, and all the powers of darkness, to
   make us victorious over them; and, in a word, to be a principle within
   us more mighty and powerful than the lusts and inclinations of our evil
   hearts, than the most obstinate and inveterate habits of sin and vice,
   and than all the temptations and terrors of sense. So that if we w ill
   make use of this assistance, and lay hold of this strength which God
   affords us in the gospel, and (as the apostle expresseth it) "be
   workers together with God," we need not despair of victory and success;
   for our strength will continually increase, and the force and violence
   of our lusts will be abated; God will give us more grace, and we shall
   "walk from strength to strength," and "our path will be (as Solomon
   says of the way of the righteous') as the light which shines more and
   more unto the perfect day."

   For the Holy Spirit of God conducts and manageth this great work of our
   sanctification and salvation, from first to last, by opening our hearts
   to let in the light of Divine truth upon our minds, by representing to
   us with advantage such arguments and considerations as are apt to
   persuade us to embrace it and yield to it; by secret and gentle
   reprehensions softening our hard hearts, and bending our stiff and
   stubborn wills to a compliance with the will of God and our duty. And
   this is that great work which the Scripture calls our regeneration and
   sanctification, the "turning us from darkness to light, and from the
   power of Satan unto God," a new creation and a resurrection from the
   death of sin to the life of holiness. And then by leading mid directing
   us in the ways of holiness and obedience, by quickening our devotion,
   and stirring up in us holy desires and dispositions of soul, rendering
   us fit to draw near to God in prayer, with a due sense of our own wants
   and unworthiness, and an humble confidence in the goodness of God, that
   he Mill grant us those good things that we ask of him, in supporting
   and comforting us in all our afflictions and sufferings especially for
   truth and righteousness sake; and by sealing and confirming to us the
   blessed hopes of eternal life. Thus the Spirit of God carries on the
   work of our sanctification, and makes us partakers of a Divine nature,
   by way of inward efficacy and assistance.

   Secondly, The promises of the gospel are apt likewise to have a mighty
   influence upon us by way of motive and argument, to engage and
   encourage us to "cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and
   spirit, and to perfect holiness in the fear of God." For,

   First, A full pardon and indemnity for what is past, is a mighty
   encouragement for us to return to our duty, and a forcible argument to
   keep us to it for the future. For since God, who hath been so highly
   injured and affronted by us, is so willing and ready to forgive us, as
   not only to provide and purchase for us the means of our pardon, by the
   grievous sufferings of his dear Son, but to offer it so freely, and
   invite us so earnestly to accept of it, and to be reconciled to him;
   the consideration of this ought in all reason, ingenuity, and
   gratitude, to melt us into sorrow and repentance for our sins, and a
   deep sense of the evil of them, and to inflame our hearts with a mighty
   love to God, and our blessed Redeemer, "who hath loved us, and washed
   us from our sins in his own blood;" and to make us extremely unwilling,
   nay, most firmly resolved never more to offend that merciful and
   gracious God, who is so slow to punish, and so forward to forgive; and
   effectually to engage us to a dutiful, and constant, and cheerful
   obedience to God's holy laws and commandments, lest by our wilful
   transgression and violation of them, we should run ourselves into a
   deeper guilt, and aggravate our condemnation. Now that by the tender
   mercies of our God we are made whole, we should be infinitely afraid to
   sin any more, lest worse things should come to us; lest we relapse into
   a more incurable state, and bring a heavier load of guilt and misery
   upon ourselves.

   Secondly, The promise of God's grace and Holy Spirit is, likewise, a
   very powerful argument and encouragement to holiness and goodness,
   engaging us to "cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and
   spirit," that our souls and minds may be a fit temple for the Holy
   Ghost, which will not dwell in an impure soul: and likewise encouraging
   us hereto by this consideration, that we have so unerring a guide to
   counsel and direct us, so powerful an assistant to "strengthen us with
   all might in the inner man, to stand by us in all our conflicts with
   sin and Satan, and make us (as the apostle expresseth it) "more than
   conquerors" over all our spiritual enemies. For though we be weak, and
   our lusts strong, our enemies many, and temptations mighty and violent;
   yet we need not be disheartened, so long as we know that God is with
   us, and the grace of his Holy Spirit sufficient for us, against all the
   strength of sin and hell; though our duty be hard, and our strength
   small, yet we cannot fail of success, if we be sure that the omnipotent
   grace of God is always ready to second our sincere, though never so
   weak, endeavours. So that, when we see all the enemies of our salvation
   drawn up in array against us, we may encourage ourselves, as the
   prophet Elisha did his servant, when he told him, that an host
   compassed the city with horses and chariots, and said, "Alas! my
   master, how shall we do?" And "he answered, Fear not, for they that be
   with us, are more than they that be with them;" (2 Kings vi. 10.) or,
   as Hezekiah comforted the people, when they were afraid of the mighty
   force of the King of Assyria: (2 Chron. xxxii. 7, 8.) "Be strong and
   courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the King of Assyria, nor for
   all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with
   him. With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God, to
   help us, and to fight for us." This is the case of every Christian; the
   force that is against us is finite and limited; but the Almighty God is
   on our side, and fights for us; and every one of us may say with St.
   Paul, (Phil. iv. 13.) "I can do all things through Christ which
   strengtheneth me."

   Thirdly, The promise of eternal life and happiness, if duly weighed and
   considered, hath a mighty force in it, to take us off from the love and
   practice of sin, and to encourage our obedience and patient continuance
   in well-doing. The assurance of enjoying unspeakable and endless
   happiness in another world, and of escaping extreme and eternal misery,
   is a consideration of that weight, as one would think could not fail of
   its efficacy upon us, to put all temptations to sin out of countenance,
   and to bear down before us all the difficulties and discouragements in
   the way of our duty. And if this make no impression upon us, if heaven
   and hell be of no weight with us, it will be in vain to use any other
   arguments, which, in comparison of this, are but as the very small dust
   upon the balance. For if, on the one hand, the hopes of perfect
   comfort, and joy, and felicity, perpetual in duration, and vast beyond
   all imagination, such as "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath
   entered into the heart of man to conceive:" and if, on the other hand,
   the dread of the terrible wrath of God, and of the vengeance of eternal
   fire, together with the insupportable torments of a guilty conscience,
   and the perpetual stings of bitter remorse and anguish for the wilful
   folly of our wicked lives, and the rage of horrible despair of ever
   getting out of so miserable a state; if neither of these
   considerations, if both of them will not prevail upon us to cease to be
   evil, and to resolve to be good, that we may obtain one of these
   conditions, and may escape the other; there is no hope that any words
   that can be used, any arguments and considerations that can be offered,
   should work upon us, or take place with us. He that is not to be
   tempted by such hopes, nor to be terrified by such fears, is proof
   against all the force of persuasion in the world.

   And thus I have done with the two things which I proposed to consider
   from these words; the nature of these promises, and the influence they
   are apt, and ought, to have upon us, to raise us to the perfection of
   virtue and goodness, which the apostle here calls our being partakers
   of a Divine nature. All that now remains is, to make some useful
   reflections upon what hath been discoursed upon these two heads.

   First of all, If we expect the blessings and benefits of these
   exceeding great and precious promises of the gospel, we must be careful
   to perform the conditions which are indispensably required on our
   parts. It is a great mistake, and of very pernicious consequence to the
   souls of men, to imagine that the gospel is all promises on God's part,
   and that our part is only to believe them, and to rely upon God for the
   performance of them,. and to be very confident that he will make them
   good, though we do nothing else but only believe that he will do so.
   That the Christian religion is only a declaration of God's good-will to
   us, without any expectation of duty from us: this is an error which one
   could hardly think could ever enter into any who have the liberty to
   read the Bible, and do attend to what they read and find there.

   The three great promises of the gospel are very expressly contained in
   our Saviour's first sermon upon the Mount. There we find the promise of
   blessedness often repealed; but never absolutely made, but upon certain
   conditions, and plainly required on our parts; as repentance, humility,
   righteousness, mercy, peaceableness, meekness, patience. Forgiveness of
   sins is likewise promised; but only to those that make a penitent
   acknowledgment of them, and ask forgiveness for them, and are ready to
   grant that forgiveness to others, which they beg of God for themselves.
   The gift of God's Holy Spirit is likewise there promised; but it is
   upon condition of our earnest and importunate prayer to God. The gospel
   is every where full of precepts, enjoining duty and obedience on our
   part, as well as of promises on God's part, assuring blessings to us;
   nay, of terrible threatenings also if we disobey the precepts of the
   gospel. St. Paul gives us the sum of the gospel in very few and plain
   words, declaring upon what terms we may expect that salvation which the
   gospel offers to all men: (Tit. ii. 11, 12, 13, 14.) "The grace of God
   which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men; teaching us, that,
   denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and
   righteously, and godly in this present world, looking for that blessed
   hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour
   Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
   iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works." And then he adds, "these things speak, and exhort, and rebuke
   with all authority;" intimating, that though men were very averse to
   this doctrine, it ought to be inculcated with great authority and
   earnestness, and those who opposed and despised it, to be severely
   rebuked: and with great reason, because the contrary doctrine does most
   effectually undermine and defeat the whole design of the Christian
   religion.

   Secondly, From hence we learn, that if the promises of the gospel have
   not this effect upon us, to make us partakers of a Divine nature, it is
   our own fault, and because we are wanting to ourselves. God is always
   ready to do his part, if we do not fail in ours. There is a Divine
   power and efficacy goes along with the gospel, to make way for the
   entertainment of it in the hearts of men, where they put no bar and
   obstacle to it. But if men will resist the motions of God's blessed
   Spirit, and quench the light of it, and obstinately hold out against
   the force of truth, God will withdraw his grace and Holy Spirit from
   them. The gospel would raise us to the perfection of all virtue and
   goodness, and the promises of it are admirably fitted to relieve the
   infirmities and weakness of human nature, and to renew us "after the
   image of God, in righteousness and true holiness;" to take us off from
   sin and vice, and to allure us to goodness, and to assist and encourage
   us iii the practice of it: but if we will not comply with the gracious
   design of God in the gospel, and suffer these promises to have their
   due influence and efficacy upon us, we wilfully deprive ourselves of
   all the blessings and benefits of it; we "reject the counsel of God
   against ourselves," and "receive the grace of God in vain;" and, by
   rejecting and despising his promises, we provoke him to execute his
   threatenings upon us.

   Thirdly and lastly, If the promises of the Christian religion are apt
   in their own nature to work this great effect upon us, to make us like
   to God, and to bring us to so near a resemblance of the Divine
   perfections, to make us good, and just, and merciful, and patient, and
   "holy in all manner of conversation, to purge us from our iniquities,
   and to make us a peculiar and excellent people, zealous of good works;"
   I say, if this be the proper tendency of the gospel, and the promises
   of it, how doth this upbraid the degenerate state of the Christian
   world at this day, which does so abound in all kind of wickedness and
   impiety; so that we may cry out as he did, upon reading the gospel;
   Profecto aut hoc non est evangelium; aut nos non sumus evangelici;
   "Either this is not the gospel which we read, and the Christian
   religion which we profess; or we are no Christians." We are so far from
   that pitch of goodness and virtue which the Christian religion is apt
   to raise men to, and which the apostle here calls the Divine nature,
   that a great part of us are degenerated into beasts and devils,
   wallowing in abominable and filthy lusts, indulging ourselves in those
   devilish passions of malice and hatred, of strife and discord, of
   revenge and cruelty, of sedition and disturbance of the public peace,
   to that degree, as if the grace of God had never appeared to us to
   teach us the contrary. And therefore, it concerns all those who have
   the face to call themselves Christians, to demean themselves at another
   rate, and for the honour of their religion, and the salvation of their
   own souls, to have their "conversation as becometh the gospel of
   Christ;" and by departing from the vicious practices of this present
   evil world, to do what in them lies to prevent the judgments of God
   which hang over us; or if they cannot do that, to "save themselves from
   this untoward generation."

SERMON XCVIII.

  THE SUPPORT OF GOOD MEN UNDER THEIR SUFFERINGS FOR RELIGION.

   Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of Go l, commit
   the, keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful
   Creator.--1 Pet. iv. 19.

   THIS Epistle was written by St. Peter, who was the apostle of the
   circumcision to the dispersed Jews, who were newly converted to
   Christianity; and the design of it is to confirm and establish them in
   the profession of it; and to instruct them how they ought to demean
   themselves towards the heathen, or gentiles, among whom they lived;
   and, more particularly, to arm and prepare them for those sufferings
   and persecutions, which he foretels would shortly overtake them for the
   profession of Christianity, that, when they should happen, they might
   not be surprised and startled at them, as if some strange and
   unexpected thing were to come upon them; at the 12th verse of this
   chapter--"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial
   which is to try you;" that is, do not wonder, and he not astonished at
   it; as if "some strange thing happened unto you."

   And then he instructs them more particularly, how they ought to behave
   themselves under those trials and sufferings, when they should happen;
   not only with patience, which men ought to exercise under all kind of
   sufferings, upon what account and cause soever; but with joy and
   cheerfulness, considering the glorious example and reward of them:
   (ver. 13.) "But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
   sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also
   with exceeding joy:" and at the 14th verse he tells them, that besides
   the encouragement of so great an example, and so glorious a reward,
   they should be supported and assisted in a very extraordinary manner by
   the Spirit of God resting upon them in a glorious manner, as a
   testimony of the Divine power and presence with them: (ver. 14.) "If ye
   be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of
   glory and of God resteth upon you;" or as it is in the best copies,
   "for the Spirit of glory and of power, even the Spirit of God, resteth
   upon you;" that is, the glorious power of the Divine Spirit is present
   with you, to comfort and bear up your spirits under these sufferings.
   But then he cautions them, to take great care that their sufferings be
   for a good cause, and a good conscience: (ver. 15.) "But let none of
   you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer;" (that is,
   as an offender in any kind against human laws, made to preserve the
   peace and good order of the world:) "or as a busy-body in other men's
   matters;" (that is, as a pragmatical person, that meddles out of his
   own sphere, to the disquiet and disturbance of human society:) for to
   suffer upon any of these accounts, would be matter of shame and
   trouble, but not of joy and comfort; but if they suffered upon account
   of the profession of Christianity, this would be no cause of shame and
   reproach to them; but they ought rather to give God thanks for calling
   them to suffer in so good a cause, and upon so glorious an account:
   (ver. 16.) "Yet if any man suffer as a Christian (if that be his only
   crime) let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf;
   for the time is come, that judgment must begin at the house of God;
   (that is, the wise and just providence of God, hath so ordered it at
   this time, for very good reasons and ends, that the first calamities
   and sufferings .should fall upon Christians, the peculiar people and
   church of God, for their trial, and a testimony to the truth of that
   religion, which God was now planting in the world:) and if it first
   begin at us (that is, at us Jews, who were the ancient people of God,
   and have now embraced and entertained the revelation of the gospel),
   what shall the end be of them, that obey not the gospel of Christ?
   (that is, how much more severely will God deal with the rest of the
   Jews who have crucified the Son of God, and still persist in their
   infidelity and disobedience to the gospel:) and if the righteous
   scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?" (that
   is, if good men be saved with so much difficulty, and must through so
   many tribulations "enter into the kingdom of God," what will become of
   all ungodly and impenitent sinners? where shall they appear? how shall
   they be able to stand in the judgment of the great day?) From the
   consideration of all which, the apostle makes this inference or
   conclusion, in the last verse of this chapter: "Wherefore, let them
   that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their
   souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator."

   Thus you see the connexion and dependence of these words upon the
   apostle's foregoing discourse. I shall explain the several expressions
   in the text, and then handle the main points contained in them.

   The expressions to be explained are these: what is meant by those "that
   suffer according to the will of God;" what by "committing the keeping
   of our souls to God, as unto a faithful Creator;" and what by
   "well-doing."

   First, What is meant by "suffering according to the will of God." This
   may be understood of suffering in a good cause, such as God will
   approve; but this is not so probable, because this is mentioned
   afterwards, in the following expressions of "committing the keeping of
   our souls to God in well doing;" that is, in suffering upon a good
   account: and therefore the plain and genuine sense of this expression
   seems to be this; that those who, according to the good pleasure of
   God's will, and the wise dispensation of his providence, are appointed
   to suffer for his cause, should demean themselves so and so: "let them
   that suffer according to the will of God;" that is, those whom God
   thinks fit to call to suffering. And this agrees very well with the
   like expression, (chap. iii. of this Epistle, ver. 17.) "For it is
   better, if the will of God be so, (that is, if God have so appointed
   it, and think it fit) that ye suffer for well-doing, than for
   evil-doing."

   Secondly, What is here meant by "committing the keeping of our souls to
   God, as to a faithful Creator." That is, to deposit our lives, and all
   that belongs to us; in a word, ourselves, in the hands and custody of
   his merciful care and providence who made us, and therefore we may be
   sure will faithfully keep what we commit to him: for, as we are his
   creatures, he is engaged to take care of us, and will not abandon the
   work of his own hands. Besides that, he hath promised to be more
   especially concerned for good men, to support them in their sufferings
   for a good cause, and to reward them for it; "and he is faithful that
   hath promised."

   And therefore, there is great reason and great encouragement, in all
   our sufferings for God's cause and truth, to commit our souls to his
   care and custody; our souls, that is (as I said before) our lives, and
   all that belongs tons; in a word, ourselves: for so the word soul is
   frequently used both in the Old and New Testament: (Psal. vii. 5.) "Let
   the enemy persecute my soul, and take it;" that is, my life; for so it
   follows in the next words: "yea, let him trend down my life upon the
   earth." And, (Psal. liv. 3.) "Oppressors seek after my soul/ And,
   (Psal. lix. 3.) "They lay in wait for my soul;" that is, my life. And,
   (Psal. xvi. 10.) "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;" my soul, that
   is, myself; thou wilt not suffer me to remain in the grave, and under
   the power of death, but wilt raise me up to life again. And so likewise
   in the New Testament: (Mark viii. 33.) "Whosoever will save his life
   shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the
   gospel's, the same shall save it." The same word which is here rendered
   life, in the very next verse is rendered soul: "For what shall it
   profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
   that is, his life. And so, likewise (John xii. 25.) "He that loveth his
   life, shall lose it: and he that hateth his life in this world (in the
   original the word signifies soul), he that hateth his life in this
   world (that is, who neglecteth and exposeth his life in this world, for
   the sake of Christ), shall keep it unto life eternal." And, (Luke ix.
   25.) that which the other evangelist renders by the word soul, or life,
   he renders himself: "For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole
   world and lose himself?" and so here, in the text, to commit "the
   keeping of our souls to God," is to commit ourselves to his care and
   providence.

   Thirdly, What is here meant by "committing ourselves to him in
   well-doing:" by "well-doing" is here meant, a fixed purpose and
   resolution of doing our duty, notwithstanding all hazards and
   sufferings; which is called by St. Paul, (Rom. ii. 7.) "a patient
   continuance in well-doing." It signifies, some times, acts of goodness
   and charity; but in this Epistle it is taken in a larger sense, for
   constancy and resolution in the doing of our duty; as chap. ii. 15.
   "For so is the will of God, that with well-doing (that is, by a
   resolute constancy in a good course) ye may put to silence the
   ignorance of foolish men." And, (ver. 20.) "But if when ye do well, and
   suffer for it;" that is, if when ye "suffer for well-doing, ye take it
   patiently, this is acceptable with God." And (chap. iii. ver. 6.) "As
   long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement;" that is,
   are resolute and constant in doing your duty, notwithstanding all
   threatenings and terrors. And, (ver. 17.) "For it is better, if the
   will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing;"
   that is, for your religion and constancy in so good a cause, as
   Christians, and not as criminals, upon any other account.

   So that the plain meaning of the words is, as if the apostle had
   said--Wherefore, being forewarned of suffering and persecution for the
   cause of religion, the sum of my direction and advice upon the whole
   matter is this--that since it is the will of God that ye should suffer
   upon this account, commit yourselves, in the constant discharge of your
   duty, and a good conscience, to the particular care and providence of
   Almighty God, as your "faithful Creator."

   And now I come to handle the particular points contained in the words;
   and they are these three:

   First, That when men do suffer really and truly for the cause of
   religion, they may, with confidence, commit themselves (their lives and
   all that is dear to them) to the particular and more especial care of
   the Divine Providence.

   Secondly, Always provided, that we do nothing contrary to our duty and
   a good conscience; for this the apostle means, by "committing ourselves
   to God, in well-doing." If we step out of the way of our duty, or do
   any thing contrary to it, God's providence will not be concerned for
   us, to bear us out in such sufferings.

   Thirdly, I shall consider what ground of comfort and encouragement the
   consideration of God, as "a faithful Creator," affords to us in all our
   sufferings for a good cause and a good conscience.

   First, When men do suffer really and truly for the cause of religion
   and God's truth, they may, with confidence and good assurance, commit
   themselves (their lives and all that is dear to them), to the
   particular and more especial care of his providence. In the handling of
   this, I shall consider these three things:

   I. When men may be said to suffer really and truly for the cause of
   religion; and when not.

   II. Mow far they may rely upon the providence of God, to bear them out
   in these sufferings.

   III. What ground and reason there is to expect the more particular and
   especial care of God's providence, in case of such sufferings.

   I. When men may be said to suffer really and truly for the cause of
   religion, and God's truth; and when not. In these cases,

   First, When men suffer for not renouncing the true religion, and
   because they will not openly declare against it, and apostatize from
   it. But it will be said that, in all these cases, the question is--What
   is the true religion? to which I answer; that all discourses of this
   nature, about suffering for religion, do suppose the truth of some
   religion or other. And, among Christians, the truth of the Christian
   religion is taken for granted, wherever we speak of men's suffering
   persecution for it. And the plainest case among Christians is, when
   they are persecuted, because they will not openly deny and renounce the
   Christian religion. And this was generally the case of the primitive
   Christians; they were threatened with tortures and death, because they
   would not renounce Jesus Christ and his religion, and give
   demonstration thereof, by offering sacrifices to the heathen gods.

   Secondly, Men do truly suffer for the cause of religion, when they are
   persecuted only for making an open profession of the Christian
   religion, by joining in the assemblies of Christians for the worship of
   God; though they be not urged to deny and disclaim it, but only to
   conceal and dissemble the profession of it, so as to forbear the
   maintenance and defence of it upon fitting occasions, against the
   objections of those who are adversaries of it. For to conceal the
   profession of it, and to decline the defence of it when just occasion
   is offered, is to be ashamed of it, which our Saviour interprets to be
   a kind of denial of it, and is opposed to the confessing of him before
   men: (Matt. x. 32, 33.) "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him
   will I also confess before my Father which is in heaven: but whoso ever
   shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which
   is in heaven." And this, by St. Mark, is expressed by being ashamed of
   Christ; that is, afraid and ashamed to make an open profession of him
   and his religion; (Mark viii. 38.) "Whosoever therefore shall be
   ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful
   generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh
   in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels."

   And this, likewise, was the case of the primitive Christians under the
   moderate emperors, when the persecution of them was not so hot as to
   drive them to a denial of Christ, provided they would be contented to
   conceal and dissemble their religion; in that case they did not hunt
   them out, nor prosecute them to renounce their religion, if they made
   no discovery of themselves. But yet, they who suffered, because they
   would not conceal their profession of Christianity, did truly suffer
   for the cause of religion.

   Thirdly, Men do likewise truly suffer for the cause of religion, when
   they suffer for not betraying it by any indirect and unworthy means;
   such as among the primitive Christians was the delivering up their
   Bibles to the heathen, to be burnt and destroyed by them: for to give
   up that holy Book, which is the great instrument of our religion, is,
   in I effect, to give up Christianity itself, and consent to the utter
   extirpation of it.

   And such, likewise, is the case of those who suffer in any kind for not
   contributing to break down the fences of religion in any nation, where
   the providence of God hath given it a legal establishment and security;
   or, in a word, for refusing to countenance and further any design which
   visibly tends to the ruin of religion: for to destroy religion, and to
   take away that which hinders the destruction of it, are, in effect,
   much the same thing.

   Fourthly, Men do truly suffer for the cause of religion, when they
   suffer for the maintenance and defence of any necessary and fundamental
   article of it, though they be not required to renounce the whole
   Christian religion; for what St. Paul says of the article of the
   resurrection of the dead, is true of any other necessary article of the
   Christian religion, that the denial of it is a subversion of the whole
   Christian faith; because it tends directly to the overthrowing of
   Christianity, being a wound given to it in a vital and essential part.
   And this was the case of those who, in any age of Christianity, have
   been persecuted by the heretics, for the defence of any article of
   Christianity.

   And I cannot but observe, by the way, that, after the heathen
   persecutions were ceased, persecution was first begun among the
   Christians by heretics; and hath since been taken up, and carried much
   beyond that bad pattern, by the church of Rome; which, besides a
   standing inquisition in all countries, which are entirely of that
   religion (a court, the like whereto, for the clancular and secret
   manner of proceeding, for the unjust and arbitrary rules of it, for the
   barbarous usage of men's persons, and the cruelty of its torments, to
   extort confessions from them, the sun never saw erected under any
   government in the world, by men of any religion whatsoever); I say,
   which, besides this court, hath by frequent croisadoes for the
   extirpation of heretics, and by many bloody massacres in France and
   Ireland, and several other places, destroyed far greater numbers of
   Christians, than all the ten heathen persecutions; and hath of late
   revived, and to this very day continues the same or greater cruelties,
   and a fiercer persecution of protestants, if all the circumstances of
   it be considered, than was ever yet practised upon them; and yet whilst
   this is doing almost before our eyes, in one of our next neighbour
   nations, they have the face to complain of the cannibal laws and bloody
   persecutions of the church of England, and the confidence to set up for
   the great patrons of liberty of conscience, and enemies of all
   compulsion and force, in matters of religion.

   Fifthly, Men do truly suffer for the cause of God and religion, when
   they suffer for asserting and maintaining the purity of the Christian
   doctrine and worship; and for opposing and not complying with those
   gross errors and corruptions, which superstition and ignorance had, in
   a long course of time, brought into the Christian religion. Upon this
   account many good people suffered, in many past ages, for resisting the
   growing errors and corruptions of the church of Rome; which at first
   crept in by degrees, but at last broke in like a mighty flood, which
   earned down all before it, and threatened ruin and destruction to all
   that opposed them. Upon this account, also, infinite numbers suffered
   among the Waldenses and Albigenses, in Bohemia, and in Eng land, and in
   most other countries in this western part of Christendom. And they who
   suffered, upon this account, suffered in a good cause, and for the
   testimony of the truth.

   Sixthly and lastly, Men do truly suffer for the cause of religion, when
   they suffer for not disclaiming and renouncing any clear and undoubted
   truth of God whatsoever; yea, though it be not a fundamental point and
   article of religion.

   And this is the case of those many thousands, who ever since the fourth
   council of Lateran, which was in the year 1215 (when transubstantiation
   was first defined to be an article of faith, and necessary to salvation
   to be believed), were persecuted with fire and sword, for not
   understanding those words of our Saviour, "this is my body" (which are
   so easily capable of a reasonable sense), in the absurd and impossible
   sense of transubstantiation. And though this disowning of this
   doctrine, be no express and direct article of the Christian religion,
   yet it is a fundamental article of right reason and common sense:
   because the admitting of transubstantiation, does undermine the
   foundation of all certainty whatsoever, and does more immediately shake
   the very foundation of Christianity itself. Yea, though the Christian
   religion were no ways concerned in this doctrine, yet out of reverence
   to reason and truth, and a just animosity and indignation at confident
   nonsense, a man of an honest and generous mind, would as soon be
   brought to declare or swear, that twice two do not make four, but five,
   as to profess his belief of transubstantiation.

   And though all truths are not of equal consequence and concernment, yet
   all truth is of God; and, for that reason, though we are not obliged to
   make an open profession of all truths, at all times, yet we are bound
   not to deny or renounce any truth, nor to make profession of a known
   falsehood or error: for it is merely because of the intrinsical evil of
   the thing, that it is impossible for God to lie; and the Son of God
   thought it worth his coining into the world, and laying down his life,
   to bear witness to the truth. So he himself tells us, (John xviii. 37.)
   "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that
   I should bear witness to the truth."

   Thus I have shewn you in these plain instances (to which most other
   cases may be reduced), when men may be said to suffer truly for the
   cause of religion and truth.

   1 shall mention two or three cases wherein men may seem to suffer for
   the cause of religion, but can not truly be said to do so.

   First, When men rashly expose themselves to danger, and run upon
   sufferings for the sake of religion. Thus several of the primitive
   Christians voluntarily exposed themselves when they were not called in
   question, and in the heat of their affection and zeal for God and
   religion, offered themselves to martyrdom, when none inquired after
   them. This, in the gracious interpretation of God, who, knowing the
   sincerity of their zeal, was pleased to overlook the indiscreet
   forwardness and rashness of it, might be accepted for a kind of
   martyrdom; but cannot in reason be justified, so as to be fit to be
   made a pattern, and to be recommended to our imitation. For though God
   may be pleased to excuse the weakness of a well-meaning zeal, yet he
   can approve no thing but what is reasonable.

   To suffer cheerfully for the cause of God and his truth, when he calls
   us to fight this good fight of faith, and to "resist unto blood;" and
   when we are reduced to that strait, that we must either die for God and
   his truth, or deny them; to suffer, I say, in this case with courage
   and patience, is one of the noblest of all the Christian virtues. But
   to be perfect volunteers, and to run ourselves upon sufferings, when we
   are not called to them, looks rather like the sacrifice of fools; which
   though God may mercifully excuse, and pardon the evil of the action,
   for the good meaning of it; yet he can never perfectly approve and
   accept of it. But I think there is little need now-a-days to caution
   men against this rashness; it is well if they have the grace and
   resolution to suffer when it is their duty, and when they are called to
   it.

   Secondly, Nor can men be truly said to suffer for the cause of
   religion, when they suffer not for their faith, but their fancy, and
   for the wilful and affected error of a mistaken conscience. As when men
   suffer for indifferent things, which, in heat and passion, they call
   superstition and idolatry; and for their own false opinions in
   religion, which they mistake for fundamental articles of the Christian
   faith. In this case, their mistake about these things will not change
   the nature of them, nor turn their sufferings into martyrdom: and yet
   many men have certainly suffered for their own mistakes. For as men may
   be so far deluded, as to think they do God good ser vice when they kill
   his faithful servants; so likewise may they be so far deceived, as to
   sacrifice their lives, and all that is dear to them, to their own
   culpable errors and mistakes. But this is zeal without knowledge, not
   "the wisdom which descends from above," but that which comes from
   beneath, and is like the fire of hell, which is heat without light.

   Thirdly and lastly, Nor can men truly be said to suffer from the cause
   of God and religion, when they suffer for the open profession and
   defence of truths not necessary. For though a man be obliged to make an
   open profession of all fundamental and necessary truths; yet he is
   under no such obligation to make profession of truths not necessary at
   all times; and, unless he be called to deny them, he is not bound
   either to declare or defend them; he may hold his peace, at other
   times, and be silent about them, especially when the open profession of
   them will probably do no good to others, and will certainly do hurt to
   ourselves; and the zealous endeavour to propagate such truths will be
   to the greater prejudice of charity, and the disturbance of the public
   peace of the church.

   It was a good saying of Erasmus (if we understand it as, I believe, he
   meant it, of truths not necessary) Adeo invisae sunt mihi discordiae,
   ut veritas etiam contentiosa displiceat: "I am (says he) so perfect a
   hater of discord, that I am even displeased with truth, when it is the
   occasion of contention." As a man is never to deny truth, so neither is
   he obliged to make an open profession of truths not necessary at all
   times; and if he suffer upon that account, he cannot justify it to his
   own prudence, nor have comfort in such sufferings, because he brings
   them needlessly upon himself; and no man can have comfort, but in
   suffering for doing his duty.

   And thus I have done with the first thing I proposed to inquire into;
   namely, when men may be truly said to suffer for the cause of religion.

   I proceed now to the

   Second inquiry; namely, how far men may rely upon the providence of God
   to bear them out in such suffering?

   To which I answer: that provided we do what becomes us, and is our duty
   on our part, the providence of God will not be wanting on his part, to
   bear us out in all our sufferings for his cause, one of these three
   ways.

   First, To secure us from that violent degree of temptation and
   suffering, which would be too strong for human strength and patience;
   or,

   Secondly, In case of such extraordinary temptation and trial, to give
   us the extraordinary supports and comforts of his Holy Spirit; or else,

   Thirdly, In case of a temporary fall and miscarriage, to raise us up by
   repentance, and a greater resolution and constancy under sufferings. I
   shall speak severally to these.

   First, Either the providence of God will not be wanting to secure us
   from that violent degree of temptation and suffering, which would be
   too strong for human strength and patience to bear. And this is a great
   security to good men, against the fears of final miscarriage, after all
   their labours, and pains, and sufferings in a religious course, by
   being over borne at last by the assault of a very violent and powerful
   temptation. Not but that the best of men ought always to have a prudent
   distrust of themselves, so as to keep them from security; according to
   the apostle's caution and counsel: "be not high-minded, but fear; and
   let him that stands, take heed lest he fall;" because, till we come to
   heaven, we shall never be out of the danger and possibility of falling;
   but yet, for all this, we may hope, by the sincerity and firmness of
   our resolution, under the usual influences of God's grace, to acquit
   ourselves like men, in ordinary cases of temptation and suffering.

   And, to this end, we should represent to ourselves those "exceeding
   great and precious promises" which he hath made to good men, and his
   merciful providence, which continually watcheth over them, and steers
   their course for them in this world, among those many rocks which they
   are in danger to split upon; that he is able to stablish us in the
   truth, and to keep us from falling; "to present us faultless before the
   presence of his glory with exceeding joy, and to preserve us to his
   heavenly kingdom;" and that, if we do not forsake him, and forfeit his
   care and protection, he will "keep us by his mighty power through faith
   unto salvation;" either by his merciful foresight and prevention of
   those temptations which would, probably, be too hard for us; or, if he
   thinks fit they should befal us, by supporting us under them in an
   extraordinary manner.

   For I doubt not but that the best men do owe their security and
   perseverance in goodness, much more to the merciful providence of God,
   preventing the assaults of violent and dangerous temptations, than to
   the firmness and constancy of their own resolutions. For there are very
   few persons of so firm and resolute virtue, but that one time or other
   a temptation might assault them upon such a disadvantage, as would, in
   all probability, not only stagger them, but bear them down. Now herein
   the providence of God towards good men is very remarkable, in securing
   them from those temptations which are too strong for them to grapple
   withal; like a kind and tender father, who, if he be satisfied of the
   dutiful disposition of his child towards him, will not try his
   obedience to the utmost, nor permit too strong a temptation to the
   contrary to come in his way. So the Psalmist represents God's tender
   regard and consideration of the frailty and infirmity of his children:
   (Psal. ciii. 13, 14.) "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the
   Lord pitieth them that fear him: for he knoweth our frame, he
   remembereth that we are but dust;" that is, he considereth us as men,
   and deals with us accordingly. Provided we be sincere, he will not
   suffer us to be set upon by temptations that are too big for us. And
   therefore our blessed Saviour makes it one of the petitions of that
   excellent prayer, which he hath recommended to us; "Lead us not into
   temptation;" that is, we should every day beg of God, that his
   providence would keep us out of the way of great and dangerous
   temptations, as knowing that this will be a greater security to us,
   than any strength and resolution of our own.

   Secondly, Or in case of such violent and extraordinary temptations, the
   providence of God will not be wanting to give us the extraordinary
   support and comfort of his Holy Spirit, to bear us up under them. The
   providence of God did take care of good men in all ages, and did afford
   comfort to them under great trials and sufferings; but God never made
   so express and general a promise of this to all good men, as he hath
   done by the Christian religion. Never was so constant a presence and
   influence of the Divine Spirit vouchsafed and assured to men, under any
   dispensation, as that of the gospel; wherein the Spirit of God is
   promised to all that sincerely embrace the Christian religion, to
   reside and dwell in them; not only to all the purposes of
   sanctification and holiness, but of support and comfort under the
   heaviest pressures and sufferings. For which reason the gospel is
   called the ministration of the Spirit; and is, upon this account, said
   to be more glorious than any other revelation which God had ever made
   to mankind.

   We are naturally apt to be very much disheartened and cast down at the
   apprehension of great sufferings, from the consideration of our own
   weakness and frailty; but the Spirit of Christ dwells in all true
   Christians, and the same glorious power, which raised up Jesus from the
   dead, works mightily in them that believe. St. Paul useth very high
   expressions about this matter: (Eph. i. 19.) "That ye may know, (saith
   he, speaking to all Christians) what is the exceeding greatness of his
   power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty
   power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and
   set him at his own right hand." So that every Christian is endowed with
   a kind of omnipotence, being able (as St. Paul speaks of himself) to do
   and to endure all things, "through Christ strengthening him." Of
   ourselves we are very weak, and the temptations and terrors of the
   world are very powerful; but there is a principle residing in every
   true Christian that is able to bear us up against the world, and the
   power of all its temptations. "Whatsoever is born of God (saith St.
   John) overcometh the world; for greater is he that is in you, than he
   that is in the world." The Holy Spirit of God, which dwells in all true
   Christians, is a more powerful principle of resolution, and courage,
   and patience, under the sharpest trials and sufferings, than the evil
   spirit which rules in the world is, to stir up and set on the malice
   and rage of the world against ns. "Ye are of God, little children;" he
   speaks this to the youngest and weakest Christians. "Ye are of God,
   little children, and have overcome; because greater is he that is in
   you, than he that is in the world." The malice and power of the devil
   is very great; but the goodness and power of God is greater. And
   therefore, in case of extraordinary temptation, good men, by virtue of
   this promise of God's Holy Spirit, may expect to be borne up and
   comforted in a very extraordinary and supernatural manner, under the
   greatest tribulations and sufferings for righteousness sake.

   And this was in a very signal and remarkable manner afforded to the
   primitive Christians, under those fierce and cruel persecutions to
   which they were exposed. And this may still be expected, in like cases
   of extraordinary sufferings, for the testimony of God's truth. "If ye
   be reproached (saith St. Peter in this 4th chap. ver. 14.) for the name
   of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth
   upon you." The Spirit of God is here promised to strengthen and support
   all that suffer for the name of Christ, in a very conspicuous and
   glorious manner, according to that prayer of St. Paul, (Colossians i.
   11.) that Christians might be "strengthened with all might, according
   to God's glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering, with
   joyfulness." For when God is pleased to exercise good men with trials
   more than human, and such sufferings as are beyond the common rate of
   human strength and patience to bear, he hath engaged himself to endue
   and assist them with more than human courage and resolution. So St.
   Paul tells the Corinthians, who had not then felt the utmost rage of
   persecution: (1 Cor. x. 13.) "No temptation or trial hath yet befallen
   you but what is common to man; that is, nothing but what is frequently
   incident to human nature, and what by human strength, with an ordinary
   assistance of God's grace, may be grappled withal. But, in case God
   shall call you to extraordinary sufferings, "he is faithful that hath
   promised, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,
   but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be
   able to bear it;" that is, as he hath ordered and appointed so great a
   temptation or trial to befal you, so he will take care that it shall
   have a happy issue, by enabling you to bear it, by affording you grace
   and strength equal to the violence and power of the temptation. For as
   he is said to fall into temptation, that is conquered by it; so he is
   said to get out of it, or escape it, who is enabled to bear it, and in
   so doing gets the better of it. And for this we may rely upon the
   faithfulness of God, who hath promised that we shall not be tried above
   our strength, either not above the strength which we have, or not above
   the strength which he will afford us in such a case.

   And why then should we be daunted at the apprehension of any suffering
   whatsoever, if we be secured that our comfort shall be increased in
   proportion to our trouble, and our strength in proportion to the
   sharpness and weight of our sufferings? or else,

   Thirdly, In case of temporary falling, the providence and goodness of
   God will give them the grace and opportunity of recovering themselves
   from their fall by repentance. For the providence of God may sometimes,
   for wise ends and reasons, see it fit to leave good men to their own
   frailty, and to faint and fall shamefully under sufferings, so as to
   renounce and deny the truth: sometimes to punish their vain confidence
   in themselves, as in the case of Peter, who declared more resolution,
   and bore it out with a greater confidence than any of the disciples,
   when he said to our Saviour, "though all men forsake thee, yet will not
   I;" and yet after this he fell more shamefully than any of the rest, so
   as to deny his Master with horrid oaths and imprecations; and this,
   though our Saviour had prayed particularly for him, "that his faith
   might not fail." From which instance we may learn, that God doth not
   engage himself absolutely to secure good men from falling, in case of a
   great temptation and trial; but if they be sincere, he will not permit
   them to fall finally, though he may suffer them to miscarry grievously
   for a time, to convince them of the vanity of their confidence in
   themselves and their own strength.

   Sometimes God may suffer good men to fall, in order to their more
   glorious recovery, and the greater demonstration and triumph of their
   faith and constancy afterwards; which was the case of that happy
   instrument of our Reformation here in England, Archbishop Cranmer; who,
   after he had been so great a champion of the Reformation, was so
   overcome with fear, upon the apprehension of his approaching
   sufferings, as to subscribe those errors of the church of Rome, which
   he had so stoutly op posed a great part of his life: but he did not
   long continue in this state, but by the grace of God, which had not
   forsaken him, was brought to repentance; and when he came to suffer,
   gave such a testimony of it, and of his faith and constancy, as was
   more glorious, and more to the confirmation of the faith of others,
   than a simple martyrdom could have been, if he had not fallen; for when
   he was brought to the stake, he put his right hand (with which he had
   signed the recantation) into the fire, and with an undaunted constancy
   held it there, till it was quite burnt, for a testimony of his true
   repentance for that foul miscarriage; and when he had done, gave the
   rest of his body to be burnt, which he endured with great courage and
   cheerfulness to the last. So that he made all the amends possible for
   so great a fault; and the goodness of God, and the power of his grace,
   was more glorified in his repentance and recovery than if he had never
   fallen.

   But what shall we say when, notwithstanding these promises of
   extraordinary comfort and support, in case of extraordinary sufferings,
   so great numbers are seen to faint in the day of trial, and to fall off
   from their steadfastness? Of which there were many sad instances among
   the primitive Christians; and have likewise been, of late, in our own
   times, and in places nearer to us. This, I confess, is a very
   melancholy consideration; but yet, I think, is capable of a sufficient
   answer.

   And, first of all, let this be established for a firm and undoubted
   principle, that God is faithful to his promise; and therefore we ought
   much rather to suppose, in all these cases, that there is some default
   on our part, than any failure and unfaithfulness on God's part. Thus
   St. Paul determines, in a like case, when the promise of God seemed not
   to be made good to the Jews, he lays the blame of it on their unbelief,
   but acquits God of any unfaithfulness in his promise: (Rom. iii. 3, 4.)
   "For what if some did not believe, shall their unbelief make the faith
   (or fidelity) of God without effect? God forbid: yea, let God be true,
   but every man a liar." This, I confess, does not answer the difficulty;
   but yet it ought to incline and dispose us to interpret what can fairly
   be offered for the removal of it, with all the favour that may be on
   God's side. I say, then,

   Secondly, That when good men fall, in case of extraordinary temptation,
   and recover again by repentance, and give greater demonstration,
   afterwards, of their constancy and resolution in the cause of God and
   his truth, the faithfulness of God, in his promises, is sufficiently
   vindicated, as in the cases I mentioned; because the promise of God is
   not ab solute that good men shall be preserved from falling; but that
   the temptation shall have a happy issue, and that they shall not
   finally miscarry. For promises of this nature are to be interpreted by
   us, and understood as we do our Saviour's prayer for Peter before his
   fall, that his faith should not fail finally; but though he fell
   through too much confidence in himself, he should, through the grace of
   God assisting him, be enabled to recover by repentance.

   Thirdly, The sincerity or insincerity of men, in the profession of the
   true religion, is a thing which we cannot certainly know, because we do
   not see into men's hearts; but He, who knows the heart, and tries the
   spirits of men in a balance, cannot be deceived in this matter; and
   where men are not sincere, the promise of God is not concerned to
   hinder them from discovering themselves; and the fall of such persons
   is no reflection upon the faith fulness of God. And it is reasonable
   enough to presume, that this may be the case of not a few; and that
   (like Simon Magus), after they have made a very solemn profession of
   Christianity, their hearts may not be right in the sight of God.

   Fourthly, If we put the case at the hardest, that some that were very
   sincere, after they have held out a great while, under the extremity of
   torments, have at last fainted under them, and yielded to the malice
   and cruelty of their persecutors; and, in this amazement and
   distraction, have not long after expired, without any testimony of
   their repentance: in this case, both reason and charity ought to
   restrain us from passing any very positive and severe sentence upon the
   state of such persons. For what do we know, but God, whose goodness
   will certainly make all the allowance to human frailty that reason can
   require (for he knows whereof we are made, and "remembers that we are
   but dust;" he mercifully considers every man's case, and weighs all the
   circumstances of it in an exact balance); I say, who can tell, but
   that, in such a case as I have mentioned, God may graciously be pleased
   to accept such a degree of constant suffering of great torments, for so
   long a time, for a true martyrdom, and not expect a more than human
   patience and resolution, where he is not pleased to afford more than
   human strength and support; and whether he may not look upon their
   failing and miscarriage, at last, in the same rank with the
   indeliberate actions of men in a frenzy, and beside themselves.

   And thus, God may be said, "with the temptation to make a way to
   escape," or to give a happy issue to it; since they were enabled to
   bear it, till, being distracted by their torments, their understandings
   were thrown off the hinges, and incapable of exercising any deliberate
   acts of reason. And, with out some such equitable consideration of the
   case of such persons, it will be very hard to reconcile some
   appearances of things with the goodness of God and the faithfulness of
   his promise.

   However, it will become us to abstain from all uncharitableness and
   peremptory censure of the final estate of sue h persons, especially
   till we ourselves have given greater and better testimony of our
   constancy; and, in the mean time, to leave them to the righteous and
   merciful sentence of their Master and ours, to whose judgment we must
   all stand or fall.

   I am sure it will very ill become those, who, by the providence of God,
   have escaped those sufferings, and are at present out of danger
   themselves, to sit in judgment upon those who are left to endure this
   terrible conflict; and have, perhaps, held out as long or longer than
   they themselves would have done in the like circumstances. Let us
   rather earnestly beg of the God of all grace and patience, that he
   would endue us with a greater measure of patience and constancy, if he
   see fit to call us to the exercise of it, and (which we lawfully may,
   after the example of our blessed Saviour) that, if it be his will, he
   would "let this cup pass from us," and not try us with the like
   sufferings, "lest we also be weary, and faint in our minds." I come now
   to the

   III. Third and last inquiry which I proposed: What ground and reason
   there is for good men to expect the more peculiar and especial care of
   God's providence in case of such sufferings.

   The providence of God extends to all his creatures, according to that
   of the psalmist: "the Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are
   over all his works." But he exerciseth a more peculiar providence
   towards mankind; and more peculiar yet towards those who study to
   please him by obeying his laws and doing his will. He that is assured
   of his own heart that he loves God, and would do or suffer any thing
   for him, can have no cause to doubt but that God loves him, and is
   concerned for his happiness. No man was ever afraid of God that was not
   conscious to himself that he had offended him, and, by the wilful
   breach of his laws, had put himself out of the care of his providence.
   But, on the contrary, if our hearts give us this testimony, that we
   have made it our sincere endeavour to please him, we are naturally apt
   to have good assurance and confidence of his favour and good-will
   towards us. This comfort the mind of every good man is apt to give him,
   from his own reason, and the natural notions which he hath of God.

   But, to free us from all doubt in this matter, God himself hath told us
   so, and given us plentiful assurance of it in his word: (Psal. xi. 7.)
   "The righteous Lord loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold
   the upright;" that is, he will be favourable unto them: (Psal. xxxiii.
   18.) "Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him; upon them
   that hope in his mercy." The eye of God signifies his watchful care and
   providence over good men. So that, besides the sure and well-grounded
   reasonings from the essential perfections of the Divine nature, the
   mercy and goodness of God, "we have a more sure word" of promise in the
   express declarations of God's word, and more particularly in the case
   of great temptations and sufferings. For can we think that the
   Scripture saith in vain, "Wait on the Lord, and be of good courage, and
   he shall strengthen thine heart? Many are the afflictions of the
   righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of all? The steps of a good
   man are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his ways: though he
   fall, he shall not utterly be cast down, for the Lord upholdeth him
   with his hand? The salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord; he is
   their help in time of trouble?" The same promises we find in the New
   Testament: "All things shall work together for good to them that love
   God. God is faithful, who hath promised that he will not stiffen you to
   be tempted above what ye are able, but will with the temptation make a
   way to escape." And, to mention no more, "Hold fast the profession of
   your faith without wavering; he is faithful that hath promised;" viz.
   to support you under sufferings, and to reward them.

   Thus much for the first point; namely, that when, men do suffer truly
   for the cause of religion, they may, with confidence, commit themselves
   to the more peculiar care of the Divine Providence.

SERMON XCIX.

  THE SUPPORT OF GOOD MEN UNDER THEIR SUFFERINGS FOR RELIGION.

   Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit
   the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful
   Creator.--1 Pet. iv. 19.

   FROM these words I proposed to consider these three points:

   First, That when men do suffer really and truly for the cause of
   religion, they may, with confidence, commit themselves (their lives,
   and all that is dear to them) to the peculiar and more especial care of
   the Divine Providence.

   Secondly, This we may do, always, provided that we be careful of our
   duty, and do what is required on our part; and that neither to avoid
   sufferings, nor to rescue ourselves out of them, we do any thing
   contrary to our duty and a good conscience; for this is the meaning of
   committing ourselves to God in well-doing.

   Thirdly, To shew what ground of comfort and encouragement the
   consideration of God, under the notion of "a faithful Creator," does
   afford to us, under all our sufferings for a good cause and a good
   conscience.

   The first of these points I have treated on, at large, in my former
   discourse; I proceed now to the

   Second, namely, When, in all our sufferings for the cause of religion,
   we may, with confidence and good assurance, commit ourselves to the
   peculiar and more especial care of God's providence: this is to be
   understood, always provided that we be careful of our duty, and do what
   is required on our part; and that neither to avoid sufferings, nor to
   rescue ourselves out of them, we do any thing contrary to our duty and
   a good conscience. And this, I told you, was the meaning of committing
   ourselves to God in well-doing: for if we either neglect our duty, or
   step out of the way of it by doing things contrary to it, the
   providence of God will not be concerned to bear us out in such
   sufferings. So that in our sufferings for the cause of God and
   religion, to commit ourselves to him in well doing, may reasonably
   comprehend in it these following particulars:

   1. Provided always, that we neglect no lawful means of our preservation
   from sufferings, or our deliverance out of them: in this case, men do
   not commit themselves to the providence of God, but cast themselves out
   of his care and protection; they do not trust God, but tempt him, and
   do, as it were, try whether he will stand by us when we desert
   ourselves, and bring us out of trouble when we would take no care,
   would use no endeavours to prevent it. If we will needlessly provoke
   trouble, and run ourselves upon sufferings; if we will neglect
   ourselves, and the lawful means of our preservation; if we will give
   up, and part with those securities of our religion which the providence
   of God and the laws of our country have given us; if we ourselves will
   help to pull down the fence which is about us; if we will disarm
   ourselves, and by our own act expose ourselves naked and open to danger
   and sufferings; why should we think, in this case, that God will help
   us, when we would not help ourselves by those lawful ways which the
   providence of God hath put into our hands?

   All trust in God, and dependance upon his providence, does imply that
   we join prayer and endeavour together; faith in God, and a prudent and
   diligent use of the means: if we lazily trust the providence of God,
   and so cast all our care upon him, as to take none at all ourselves,
   God will take no care of us. In vain do we rely upon the wisdom, and
   goodness, and power of God; in vain do we importune and tire Heaven
   with our prayers to help us against our enemies and persecutors, if we
   ourselves will do nothing for ourselves; in vain do we hope that God
   will maintain and defend our religion against all the secret
   contrivances and open assaults of our enemies, if we, who are united in
   the profession of the same religion, and in all the essentials of faith
   and worship, will for some small differences in lesser matters, which
   are of no moment, in comparison of the things wherein we are agreed: I
   say, if for such slight matters we will divide and fall out among
   ourselves; if, when the enemy is at the gates, we will still pursue our
   heats and animosities, and will madly keep open those breaches which
   were foolishly made at first, what can we expect, but that the common
   enemy should take the advantage and enter in at them; and, whilst we
   are so unseasonably and senselessly contending with one another, that
   they should take the opportunity which we give them to destroy us all.

   2. Provided, likewise, that we do not attempt our own preservation or
   deliverance from suffering, by evil and unlawful means: we must do
   nothing that is contrary to our duty and to a good conscience, nor
   comply with any thing, or lend a helping hand thereto, that apparently
   tends to the ruin of our religion, neither to divert nor put off
   sufferings for the present, nor to rescue ourselves from under them;
   because we cannot with confidence commit ourselves to the providence of
   God, but in well-doing.

   This is an eternal rule, from whence we must in no case depart: that
   men must do nothing contrary to the rules and precepts of religion, no,
   not for the sake of religion itself: we must not break any law of God,
   nor disobey the lawful commands of lawful authority, to free ourselves
   from any sufferings whatsoever; because the goodness of no end can
   sanctify evil means and make them lawful: we must not speak deceitfully
   for God, nor lie, no, not for the truth; nor kill men, though we could
   thereby do God and religion the greatest service. And though all the
   casuists in the world should teach the contrary doctrine (as they
   generally do in the church of Rome), yet I would not doubt to op pose
   to all those the single authority of St. Paul, who expressly condemns
   this principle, and brands it for a damnable doctrine--that evil may be
   done by us that good may come. (Rom. iii. 8.) "And not as we be
   slanderously reported, and, as some affirm, that we say, Let us do evil
   that good may come, whose damnation is just." St. Paul, it seems,
   looked upon it as a most devilish calumny to insinuate that the
   Christian religion gives the least countenance to such damnable
   doctrines and doings as these; and pronounceth their damnation to be
   just, who either teach any such principle, as the doctrine of
   Christianity, or practise according to it.

   Let those look to it, who teach that a right intention and a good end
   will render things, which are otherwise evil and unlawful, not only
   lawful to be done by us, but in many cases meritorious; especially
   where the good of the church and the extirpation of heresy are more
   immediately concerned. Of this nature are the doctrines of equivocation
   and mental reservation, and the lawfulness of such artificial ways of
   lying to avoid the danger of the law, when they are brought before
   heretical magistrates; and this is the common doctrine of the most
   learned casuists of all orders in the church of Rome: and such,
   likewise, are their doctrines of the lawfulness of extirpating heretics
   by the most barbarous and bloody means, and of breaking faith with
   them, though given by emperors and princes in the most public and
   solemn manner: both which are the avowed doctrines of their general
   councils, and have frequently been put in practice, to the destruction
   of many millions of Christians, better and more righteous than
   themselves. But we "have not so learned Christ," who have heard him,
   and been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus. They, who are rightly
   instructed in the Christian religion, are so far from thinking it
   lawful to do any thing that is evil to bring others under suffering,
   that they do not allow it in any case whatsoever; no, not for the cause
   of God and religion, and to free themselves from the greatest
   sufferings that can be inflicted upon them.

   .3. Provided, also, that we do trust the providence of God, and do
   indeed commit ourselves to it; relying upon his wisdom and goodness,
   and entirely submitting and resigning up ourselves to his will and
   disposal, both as to the degree and the duration of our sufferings;
   believing that he will do that for us which, upon the whole matter, and
   in the final issue and result of things, will be best for us. That
   blessing wherewith Moses, the man of God, blessed the people of Israel
   before his death, doth belong to all good men in all ages: "He loveth
   his people, and all his saints are in his hand." (Deut. xxxiii. 3.)
   Innumerable are the promises in Scripture concerning the merciful
   providence and goodness of God towards those who trust in him, and
   "hope in his mercy." (Psal. xxxii. 10.) "Many sorrows shall be to the
   wicked; but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him
   about." (Psal. xxxiii. 18-22.) "Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon
   them that fear him; upon them that hope in his mercy: to deliver their
   soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waiteth for
   the Lord: he is our help and our shield. For our heart shall rejoice in
   him: because we have trusted in his holy name. Let thy mercy, O Lord,
   be upon us, according as we hope in thee." (Psal. xxxiv. 22.) "The Lord
   redeemeth the soul of his servants, and none of them that trust in him
   shall be desolate." (Psal. xxxvii. 39, 40.) "But the salvation of the
   righteous is of the Lord; he is their strength in the time of trouble.
   And the Lord shall help them and deliver them: he shall deliver them
   from the wicked, and save them because they trust in him." (Psal. xxxi.
   19.) "O how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
   that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee
   before the sons of men." (Psal. lv. 22.) "Cast thy burden upon the
   Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to
   be moved." (Psal. cxxv. i.) "They that trust in the Lord shall be as
   mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever." (Isa. xxvi.
   3, 4.) "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
   thee, because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for
   in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength."

   4. Provided yet further, that we pray earnestly to God for his gracious
   help and assistance, for his merciful comfort and support under
   sufferings; that he would be pleased to strengthen our faith, and to
   increase and lengthen out our patience, in proportion to the degree and
   duration of our sufferings.

   All the promises which God hath made to us are upon this condition,
   that we earnestly seek and sue to him for the benefit and blessing of
   them. (Psal. l. 15.) "Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will
   deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." (Ezek. xxxvi. 37.) After a
   great deliverance, and many blessings promised to them, this condition
   is at last added, "Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be
   inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them." And this,
   likewise, is the tenor of the promises of the New Testament: (Matt.
   vii. 7.) "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
   knock, and it shall be opened unto you." And in this very case that lam
   speaking of, God expects that we should apply ourselves to him for
   spiritual wisdom and grace, to behave ourselves under sufferings as we
   ought: Jam. i. 2, 3, 4. Where speaking" of the manifold temptations the
   Christians would be exercised withal, he directs them to pray to God
   for wisdom to demean themselves under persecutions, with patience, and
   constancy, and cheerfulness. "My brethren, account it all joy, when you
   fall into divers temptations; (meaning the temptations and trials of
   suffering in several kinds) knowing this, that the trial of your faith
   worketh patience. But let patience have its perfect work." And because
   this is a very difficult duty, and requires a great deal of spiritual
   skill, to demean ourselves under sufferings as we ought, therefore he
   adds in the next words, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,
   that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be
   given him."

   And this earnest application we are to make to God, for his grace and
   seasonable help in time of need; not to put him in mind of his promise,
   but to testify our dependance upon him, and expectation of all good
   from him. And we must likewise use great importunity in our prayers to
   God, to assist us and stand by us in the day of trial, and the hour of
   temptation. And therefore our Saviour heaps up several words, to denote
   the great earnestness and importunity which we ought to use in prayer,
   bid ding us to ask, and seek, and knock. And, to shew that he lays more
   than ordinary weight upon this matter, and to encourage our
   importunity, he spake two several parables to this purpose: the first,
   (Luke xi. 5.) of the man who by mere importunity prevailed with his
   friend to rise at midnight to do him a kindness, which our Saviour
   applies to encourage our importunity in prayer: (ver. 9.) "And I say
   unto you, ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
   knock, and it shall be opened unto you." The other is the parable of
   the importunate widow and unjust judge, related by the same evangelist,
   (Luke xviii. 1.) with this preface to it; and "he spake a parable unto
   them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint."
   And, to speak the truth, they seem, at first sight, two of the oddest
   of all our Saviour's parables; as if the design of them were to
   insinuate to us, that God is to be prevailed upon by the mere
   importunity of our prayers to grant our requests: but our blessed
   Saviour, who best knew his own meaning, tells us, that all that he
   designed by it, was only to signify, that we "ought always to pray, and
   not to faint;" that is, to "continue instant in prayer," and not to
   give over after once asking, as if we despaired of prevailing. Not that
   mere importunity prevails with God to give us those things which he is
   otherwise unwilling to grant; but because it becomes us to be fervent,
   and earnest, to testify our faith and confidence in the goodness of
   God, and the deep sense we have of our own weakness, and wants, and
   unworthiness; and, likewise, that we set a true value upon the
   blessings and favours of God, as worth all the earnestness and
   importunity we can use: and, in this decent and sober sense, the
   success of our prayers may truly be said to depend upon our
   importunity; not that it is necessary to move God to grant our
   requests, but that it becomes us to be thus a fleeted, that we may be
   the more fitly qualified for the grace and mercy which God is willing
   to confer upon us.

   I have been the longer upon this, to give us a right notion of this
   matter, and that we may the more distinctly understand the true reason
   why our Saviour does require so much earnestness and importunity of
   prayer on our part; not at all to work upon God, and to dispose him to
   shew mercy to us (for that he is always inclinable to, whenever we are
   fit for it), but only to dispose and qualify us to receive the grace
   and mercy of God with greater advantage to ourselves.

   5. Provided, moreover, that we be not confident of ourselves, and of
   the force and strength of our resolution. We know not ourselves, nor
   the frailty mid weakness of our own revolution, till we are tried. It
   is wise advice which Solomon gives us, and never more seasonable than
   in the day of trial: (Prov. iii. 5, 6, 7.) "Trust in the Lord with all
   thine heart, and lean not to thine own understanding; in all thy ways
   acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths; be not wise in thine
   own eyes;" that is, be not conceited and confident of thine own wisdom
   and strength, or ability in any kind; there is a secret providence of
   God, which mingles itself with the actions and spirits of men, and
   disposeth of us unknown to ourselves; and what we think to be the
   effect of our own strength and resolution, of our own wisdom and
   contrivance, proceeds from a higher cause, which, unseen to us, does
   steer and govern us. So the wise man observes: (Prov. xx. 24.) "Man's
   goings are of the Lord, how can a man then understand his own ways?"
   And therefore we have reason every one to say with the prophet: (Jer.
   x. 23.) "O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is
   not in man that walketh to direct his steps." Our feet will soon slip,
   if God do not uphold us by his hand. Remember how shamefully the chief
   of our Lord's disciples miscarried, by too much confidence in
   himself--I mean St. Peter; in whose fall we may all see our own
   frailty: if God do but permit the devil to have the winnowing of us,
   there will be a great deal of chaff found in the best of us. What St.
   Paul said of himself, (2 Cor. xii. 10.) "When I am weak, then am I
   strong;" we shall all find true, when it comes to the trial: we are
   then strongest, when, in a just sense of our own weakness, we rely most
   upon the strength and power of God.

   6. Provided furthermore, that, according to our ability, we have been
   much in the exercise of alms and charity. For well-doing, or doing
   good, is sometimes taken in a narrower sense, not improper here to be
   mentioned, though perhaps not so particularly intended here in the text
   for works of charity and alms. As, (Heb. xiii. 16.) "But to do good,
   and to communicate (that is, to the necessities of the poor) forget
   not, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased." This kind of
   well-doing is a special preservative in times of evil; there is no kind
   of grace or virtue to which there are in Scripture more special
   promises made, of our protection and preservation from evil and
   suffering, of support and comfort under them, and deliverance out of
   them, than to this of a charitable and compassionate consideration of
   those who labour under want or suffering. (Psal. xxxvii. 3.) "Trust in
   the Lord, and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou
   shalt be fed:" and (ver. 19.) speaking of righteous or merciful men,
   "they shall not be ashamed in the evil time, and in the days of famine
   they shall be satisfied." (Psal. xli. 1, 2.) "Blessed is he that
   considereth the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble; the
   Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed
   upon the earth; and thou wilt not deliver him into the will of his
   enemies."

   There are, likewise, in the apocryphal books, excellent sayings for the
   encouragement of charity, as that which will be particularly considered
   and rewarded to us in the times of danger and distress, in the days of
   affliction and suffering. (Tob. iv. 7-10.) "Give alms of thy substance,
   and turn not thy face from any poor man, and the face of God shall not
   be turned away from thee; if thou hast abundance, give alms
   accordingly; if thou hast but a little, be not afraid to give according
   to that little, for thou layest up for thyself a good treasure against
   the day of necessity, because that alms do deliver from death, and
   suffereth not to come into darkness." (Ecclus. iii. 31.) Speaking of
   him that gives alms, and is ready to do kindness to others: "He is
   mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falleth he shall
   find a stay." And, (chap. xxix. 11, 12, 13.) "Lay up thy treasure
   according to the commandment of the Most High, and it shall bring thee
   more profit than gold; shut up alms in thy store-houses, and it shall
   deliver thee from all affliction; it shall fight for thee against thine
   enemies, better than a mighty shield and strong spear."

   I have often said it, and am verily persuaded of it, that one of the
   best signs of God's mercy and favour to this poor nation is, that God
   hath been pleased, of late years, to stir up so general a disposition
   in men to works of alms and charity, and thereby to revive the
   primitive spirit of Christianity, which so eminently abounded in this
   grace, and taught those who believed in God to be "careful to maintain
   and practise good works." And nothing gives me greater hopes that God
   hath mercy still in store for us, than that men are so ready to shew
   mercy: there are great objects to exercise our charity upon in this
   time of the general suspension of trade and business, from an
   apprehension of approaching troubles; by reason whereof, both the
   numbers and necessities of our poor are greatly and daily increased
   among us; and, besides, the poor of our own nation, God has sent us
   great numbers from abroad, I mean those who are fled hither for shelter
   from that violent storm of persecution which hath lately fallen upon
   them for the cause of our common religion. According to the compassion
   we shew to them, we may expect that God will either preserve us from
   the like sufferings, or graciously support us under them. What do we
   know but that God is now trying us, and hath purposely put this
   opportunity into our hands of preventing, or mitigating, or shortening,
   our own sufferings, according as we extend our charity and pity to
   those who have suffered so deeply for the cause of God and his truth?

   7. Provided, in the last place, and above all, that we be sincere in
   our religion, and endeavour to be universally good, and "holy in all
   manner of conversation," and "to abound in all the fruits of
   righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of
   God." This is the largest sense of well-doing, and the most necessary
   of all the rest, to prepare us for sufferings, and to give us courage
   and constancy under them; and likewise to engage the providence of God
   to a tender care of us, and concernment for us, if he shall see it fit
   to bring us into a state of suffering.

   But if we live in open contempt and violation of God's laws, if we make
   no conscience of our ways and actions, we cannot possibly have any
   well-grounded trust and confidence in God; for he hates all the workers
   of iniquity, and his providence sets itself against them for evil. Bad
   men draw many mischiefs and inconveniences upon themselves, as the
   natural consequences of their actions; but, besides this, the vengeance
   of God haunts and pursues evil-doers; and his just providence many
   times involves them in many difficulties and dangers, besides and
   beyond the natural course of things. "Upon the wicked (says David) he
   will rain snares:" so that, as ever we expect the comfortable effects
   of the Divine care and providence, we must live in a dutiful obedience
   to God's holy will and laws.

   Bad men may make a profession of the true religion, and may in some
   sort believe it, though they do not live according to it; and yet,
   perhaps, for all this, out of a mere generosity and obstinacy of mind,
   they cannot bear to be threatened and terrified out of the profession
   of the truth; and will endure a great deal of trouble and
   inconveniences before they will renounce it, knowing themselves to be
   so far in the right that they stand for the truth, and hoping, perhaps,
   thereby to make some amends for their bad practice. But, when all is
   done, nothing gives a man true courage and resolution like the
   testimony of our own hearts, concerning our own sincerity, and the
   conscience of well-doing. And, on the contrary, he that hath not the
   resolution and patience to mortify his lusts, and to restrain his
   appetites, and to subdue his irregular passions for the sake of God and
   religion, will not easily bring himself to submit to great sufferings
   upon that account. There is considerable difficulty in the practice of
   religion, and the resolute course of a holy life; but surely it is much
   easier to live as religion requires we should do, than to lay down our
   lives for it; and (as I have told you upon another occasion), he that
   cannot prevail with himself to live like a saint, will much more hardly
   be persuaded to die a martyr. I proceed to the

   Third point, namely, What ground of comfort and encouragement the
   consideration of God, under the notion of a faithful Creator, does
   afford to us, under all our sufferings, for a good conscience and a
   good cause. "Let them that suffer according to the will of God commit
   the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful
   Creator." And in this I shall be very brief.

   And this is a firm ground of comfort and encouragement to us, under all
   our sufferings for God, to consider him as the Author of our beings, or
   as it is expressed in the text, as "a faithful Creator;" one that is
   not fickle and inconstant in his affection and kindness to his
   creatures, but is true to his own design, and will not abandon and
   forsake the work of his own hands: so great a benefit as that of our
   beings, freely conferred upon us, is but an earnest of God's further
   kindness to us, and future care of us; if, by our ill carriage towards
   him, we do not render ourselves unworthy and incapable of it; that we
   are God's creatures, is a demonstration that he hath a kindness for us:
   if he had not, he would never hare made us; as it is excellently said
   in the Wisdom of Solomon: (chap. xi. 23, 24.) "Thou hast mercy upon
   all, for thou lovest all the things that are, and abhorrest nothing
   which thou hast made; for never wouldst thou have made any thing if
   thou hadst hated it." And, (ver. 26.) "Thou sparest all, for they are
   thine, O Lord, thou lover of souls."

   To whom then may we with so much confidence commit ourselves, as to him
   who freely gave us our being? From whom may we expect so tender a
   regard and consideration of our case, and all the circumstances of it,
   as from this great founder and benefactor? For he that made us knows
   our frame, and whereof we are made, and how much we are able to bear;
   he considers our strength, or rather our weakness, and what courage and
   resolution he hath endued us withal, and what comfort and support we
   stand in need of in the day of tribulation. And as they who make armour
   are wont to try that which they think to be good and well-tempered with
   a stronger charge not to break and hurt it, but to prove and praise it,
   so God exerciseth those whom he hath fitted and tempered for it, with
   manifold temptations, "that the trial of their faith," as St. Peter
   expresseth it, (1 Pet. i. 7.) "being much more precious than of gold
   tried in the fire, may be found unto praise, and honour, and glory, at
   the appearing of Jesus Christ."

   So that this consideration, that we are God's creatures, does (as I may
   say) oblige him in faithfulness to his own act, and in consequence of
   his bringing us into being at first, to be concerned for us after
   wards, so as never to abandon us, nor quite to take away his
   loving-kindness and mercy from us, till we are good for nothing, and do
   in a manner cease to be what he made us, that is, reasonable creatures.
   A person or people must have proceeded to the utmost degree of
   degeneracy, when God will consider them no longer as his creatures, nor
   shew any pity or favour to them; things must be come to extremity, when
   God deals thus with us, as he threatened the people of Israel: (Isaiah
   xxvii. 11.) "When the boughs are withered, they shall be broken off,
   and set on fire; for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he
   that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them
   will shew them no favour."

   And now I have done with the three points which I proposed to handle
   from this text; and the discourse which I have made upon them, does all
   along apply itself, by directing us how we ought to commit ourselves to
   the providence of God in all cases of danger and suffering, especially
   for the cause of God and his truth; viz. in the faithful discharge of
   our duty and a good conscience, and by a firm trust and confidence in
   the wisdom and goodness of the Divine Providence, not doubting but that
   he who made us, and knows our frame, will have a tender care of us, and
   "not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able."

   And as to our present danger, and that terrible storm which threatens
   us, let us pray to God, if it be his will, to divert it; but if
   otherwise he hath determined, to tit and prepare us for it. And let us
   be fervent and earnest in our prayers to him, not that he is moved by
   our importunity, but that we may thereby be qualified and made fit to
   receive the mercy which we beg of him.

   And let us take this occasion to do that which we should have done
   without it, to break off our sins by repentance, and to turn every one
   of us from the evil of our ways; that hereby we may render God
   propitious to us, and put ourselves under the more immediate care and
   protection of his providence; that we may prevent his judgments, and
   turn away his wrath and displeasure from us, as he did once from a
   great and sinful city and people, upon their sincere humiliation and
   repentance, (Jonah iii. 10.) where it is said of the people of Nineveh,
   that "God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and
   God repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto them, and he
   did it not." Above all, let us be sincere in the profession of our
   religion, and conscientious in the practice of it; no thing will bear
   us up under great trials and sufferings, like "the testimony of a good
   conscience, void of offence towards God and towards men."

   I will conclude this whole discourse with those apostolical blessings
   and prayers: (Col. i. 10, 11.) "That ye may walk worthy of the Lord,
   unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, strengthened with
   all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience, and
   long-suffering, with joyfulness." And, (2 Thess. ii. 16, 17.) "Now our
   Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, who hath loved us,
   and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
   comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work. To him be
   glory and dominion for ever and ever." Amen.

SERMON C.

  OF THE WORK ASSIGNED TO EVERY MAN, AND THE SEASON FOR DOING IT.

   1 must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night
   cometh, when no man can work.--Johnix. 4.

   THESE words our blessed Saviour spake of himself, whilst he was upon
   earth; in which he tells us, that he was sent by God into the world,
   and had a certain work and employment appointed him during his abode in
   it. A great work indeed! to instruct, and reform, and save mankind. A
   work of great labour and pains, and patience, not to be done in a short
   time; and yet the time for doing it was not long after he came into the
   world: it was a good while before he began it; and, after he began it,
   the time of working was not long before the night came, and put an end
   to it: "I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
   night cometh, when no man can work."

   But this which our Saviour here speaks of himself, and which properly
   belongs to him, and no other, may yet be accommodated to every man,
   with some allowance for the difference and disproportion. For though
   every man be not sent by (Jud into the world after so peculiar a
   manner, and upon so particular and vast a design; yet upon a general
   account, every man is sent by God into this world, and hath a work
   given him to do in it, which he is concerned vigorously to mind, and to
   prosecute with all his might. And though every man be not sent to save
   the whole world, as the Son of God was, yet every man is sent by God
   into the world, to work out his own salvation, and to take care of
   that, in the first place, and then to promote the salvation of others,
   as much as in him lies. So that every one of us may, in a very good
   sense, accommodate these words of our Saviour to himself: "I must work
   the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when
   no man can work."

   I shall therefore, at this time, take the liberty to handle these words
   according to this moral accommodation of them, and apply what our
   Saviour here says of himself, to every man that cometh into the world;
   and this I shall do, by shewing these three things:

   First, That every man hath a work assigned him to do in this world, by
   him that sent him into it; and may in some sense say, as our blessed
   Saviour did of himself, "I must work the works of him that sent me."

   Secondly, That there is a certain and limited time for every man to do
   this work in. "While it is day."

   Thirdly, That after this season is expired, there will be no further
   opportunity of working. "The night cometh, when no man can work."

   First, Every man hath a work assigned him to do in this world, by him
   that sent him into it, and may in some sense say, as our blessed
   Saviour did of himself, "I must work the works of him that sent me."
   God, who made man a reasonable creature, and hath endowed him with
   faculties, whereby he is capable of knowing and serving him, hath
   appointed him a work and service suitable to these faculties; and,
   having infused an immortal soul into this earthly body, hath certainly
   designed him for a state beyond this life, in which he shall be for
   ever happy or miserable, according as he useth and demeans himself in
   this world.

   So that the work which every one of us hath to do in this world, is to
   prepare and fit ourselves for that eternal duration which remains for
   us after death. For the life which we live now in this world, is a time
   of exercise, a short state of probation and trial, in order to a
   durable and endless state, in which we shall be immutably fixed in
   another world. This world into which we are now sent for a little
   while, is, as it were, God's school, in which immortal spirits, clothed
   with flesh, are trained and bred up for eternity: and therefore the
   best, the only sure way to be happy for ever, is so to improve the
   short and uncertain time of this life, that we may approve ourselves to
   God in this world, and enjoy him in the next: or (as St. Paul
   expresseth it) that "having our fruit unto holiness, our end may be
   everlasting life."

   And this work consists in these three things:

   I. In the care of our own salvation.

   II. In doing what we can to promote the salvation of others.

   III. And, in order to both these, in the careful improvement and good
   husbandry of our time.

   I. In the care of our own salvation. And this consists in two things:

   1. In the worship of Almighty God.

   2. In the careful and conscientious practice and obedience of his holy
   laws.

   1. The care of our own salvation consists in the pious and devout
   worship of Almighty God; that we honour him, and pay him that homage
   and respect, which is due from creatures to him that made them, and is
   the great Sovereign and Judge of the world; that we have an inward
   reverence and esteem of him, and that we express this by all solemn
   external acknowledgments of him; as by praying to him for the supply of
   our wants; by praising him for all the blessings and benefits which we
   hare received at his hands; and that we set apart constant and solemn
   times for the performance of these duties; and that, when we are
   employed in them, we be serious and hearty, and attentive to what we
   are about, and perform every part of Divine worship with those
   circumstances of reverence and respect, which may testify our awful
   sense of the Divine Majesty, and our inward and profound veneration of
   him, with whom we have to do: and this is that which is directly and
   properly religion.

   2. This care of our own salvation does consist, likewise, in the
   conscientious and constant obedience and practice of all God's holy
   laws, in the conformity of our lives and actions to the laws which he
   hath given us, whether they be natural, or written upon our hearts, or
   made known to us by the revelation of his word; that we govern our
   passions by reason, and moderate ourselves in the use of sensual
   delights, -so as not to transgress the rules of temperance and
   chastity; that we demean ourselves to wards others, and converse with
   them with justice and fidelity, with kindness and charity.

   These are the sum of the Divine laws, and the heads of our duty towards
   ourselves and others; all which are more powerfully enforced upon us by
   the revelation of the gospel, and the plain promises and threatenings
   of it; the faith of Christ being the most firm and effectual principle
   both of piety to wards God, and of universal obedience to all his
   particular commands.

   And this is the great work which God hath sent us to do in the world.
   So the wise man sums up our duty: (Eccles. xii. 13.) "Fear God, and
   keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man." The fear and
   reverence of the Divine Majesty is the great foundation and principle
   of religion; but obedience to God's laws is the life and practice of
   it. God does not expect that we should spend the greatest part of our
   time in the immediate acts of religion, and in the solemn duties of his
   worship and service; but only that we should allot a fitting proportion
   of our time to these, according to the circumstances of our condition
   in this world, and the example of holy and good men that are in the
   like circumstances with ourselves. For such is the goodness of God,
   that he does not only allow us to provide for the necessaries and
   conveniences of this life, but hath made it our duty so to do. It is
   one of the precepts of the gospel, which the apostle chargeth the
   bishops and teachers of the gospel to inculcate frequently upon
   Christians, "that they which have believed in God, should be careful to
   maintain good works;" that is, to employ themselves in the works of an
   honest calling: for necessary uses; that is, for the support of their
   families, and the relief of those who are in want and necessity. And
   the apostle lays great weight and stress upon this as a very great
   duty: (Tit. iii. 8.) "This is a faithful saying, and these things I
   will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God,
   might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
   profitable unto men;" that is, of general benefit and advantage to
   mankind.

   So that no man's calling is a hinderance to religion, but a part of it;
   and by performing the duties of piety in their proper seasons, and
   spending the rest of our time in any honest and useful employment, we
   may make our whole life a perpetual serving of God; we may glorify God
   in our eating and drinking, and in all other lawful and useful actions
   of life. In serving the occasions and necessities of life with sobriety
   and temperance, and in managing our worldly commerce with justice and
   integrity, we may serve God, and perform consider able duties of
   religion.

   So that provided we do nothing that is sinful, and manage the actions
   and concernments of this life with a due regard and subserviency to the
   great interests of eternity, we may do the work of God all the while we
   are providing for ourselves, and employed in the works of an honest
   calling: for God, who hath designed this life in order to the other,
   considers the necessities of our present state, and allows us to make
   provision for it.

   There are some persons, indeed, whose birth and condition sets them
   above the common employments of life, and the works of an ordinary
   calling: but these also have a work given them to do: for God hath sent
   no man into the world to no purpose, and only to take his pastime
   therein; neque enim ita generati sumus a natura, ut ad ludum et jocum
   facti esse videamur; sed ad severitatem potius, et quaedam studia
   graviora atque majora: "For we are not (says Tully de offic. lib. 1.)
   so framed by nature, as if we were made for sport and jest, but for
   more serious employments, and for greater and weightier business;" and
   those who are tied to no particular calling, may allow so much larger
   portions of their time to religion, and the service of God: and God
   likewise expects from them, that they should be useful to mankind in
   some higher and nobler way, according to the publicness of their
   station and influence. Such persons may be serviceable to their
   country, and the affairs of government, and in the care of public
   justice, and may employ their time in preparing and rendering
   themselves more fit for this service. They may find a great deal of
   work to do in the good government of their families, and in the prudent
   care and management of their estates, and in reconciling differences
   among their neighbours, and in considering the necessities of the poor,
   and providing for their supply.

   So that, besides the proper work of religion, and the more immediate
   service of God, every man in the world, how exempt soever his condition
   be from the common care and drudgery of human life, may find work
   enough wherein he may usefully employ all his time, and provide for his
   own, and for the common benefit of mankind; and God expects it as a
   duty from such, that every man should employ himself in some work or
   other, suitable to the station in which God hath placed him in this
   world.

   II. The work which God hath given us to do in the world, consists in
   doing what we can to further and promote the salvation of others. This
   chiefly lies upon us, who are the ministers of God, and to whom the
   word of reconciliation is committed. We are more especially
   commissioned and appointed for this work, and are ambassadors for
   Christ, to beseech men in his stead to be reconciled to God. We are
   sent by God in a more peculiar manner, and appointed for this very
   work, to watch for men's souls, and to be instruments and means of
   their eternal happiness. And therefore we who are sent by God in a more
   peculiar manner, and have this work as signed to do in the world, ought
   to be very vigorous and industrious in it: and this, whether we
   consider the nature of our employment, or the glorious reward of it.

   1. If we consider the nature of our employment, both in respect of the
   honour and the happiness of it. It is the most honourable work that
   mortal man can be employed in; it is the same in kind, and in the main
   end and design of it, with that of the blessed angels; for we also are
   "ministering spirits, sent forth" by God to minister for the good of
   those "who shall be heirs of salvation." We are the messengers and
   ambassadors of God to men, sent to treat with them about the terms of
   their peace and reconciliation with God, to offer salvation to them,
   and to direct them to the best ways and means of procuring it. Nay, we
   have the honour to be employed in the very same work that the Son of
   God was, when he was upon the earth, "to seek and to save them that are
   lost;" and "to call sinners to repentance;" and to carry on that work,
   whereof he himself laid the foundation, when he was in the world. And
   what greater honour can be put upon the sons of men, than to help
   forward that glorious design and undertaking of the Son of God for the
   salvation of mankind?

   And it is an employment no less happy than honourable; it is not to
   drudge about the mean and low concernments of this life, a perpetual
   toil and care about "what we shall eat and drink, and wherewithal we
   shall be clothed," which is the business of a worldly employment; but
   it is a direct and immediate "seeking the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness," and a continual endeavour to promote these. It does not
   consist in the labour of our body, and in bodily toil; but in the
   delightful exercise of our minds, about the best and noblest objects,
   God, and heaven, and eternity; in an earnest and faithful endeavour, by
   all wise ways and means, to gain souls to God, and to turn sinners from
   the errors of their ways, and to prevent their eternal ruin and
   destruction; and, next to the procuring of our own happiness, to be
   instrumental to the happiness of others, which is certainly the most
   pleasant and noble work that we can possibly be employed in; especially
   if we consider that, by the very nature of our employment we do at the
   same time, and by the very same means, carry on both these designs, of
   the salvation of ourselves and others. So St. Paul tells Timothy, when
   he exhorts him, upon this very consideration, to give himself wholly to
   this blessed work; because, says he, "in doing this, thou shalt both
   save thyself, and them that hear thee." (1 Tim. iv. 16.) And when two
   of the greatest and best designs in the world, our own happiness in the
   salvation of others, do so happily meet in one, and are jointly carried
   on by the same labour: this ought to be a great spur and incitement to
   us, to be vigorous and unwearied, and "abundant in the work of the
   Lord;" and a mighty encouragement to us "to preach the word, to be
   instant in season, and out of season," and "to be examples to others,
   in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity;"
   as St. Paul chargeth Timothy in the most solemn and awful manner,
   "before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and
   the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom." (1 Tim. iv. 12. and 2 Tim.
   iv. 1.) And then,

   2. If we consider the glorious reward of this work; if we be faithful
   and industrious in it, it will advance us to a higher degree of glory
   and happiness in the other world. "They that be wise (says the prophet,
   Dan. xii. 3.) shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they
   that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever." They
   that are industrious in this work, as they are worthy of double honour
   in this world, so they shall shine with a double glory and lustre
   in^the other.

   But though this work of promoting the salvation of others be chiefly
   incumbent upon those whose office it is to attend upon this very thing,
   yet we are all of us concerned in it; according to the advantages and
   opportunities we have for it. Every man is concerned to help forward
   the salvation of his brother, and not to let him perish, if he can help
   it; and it is in every man's power to contribute something to this
   blessed work of saving others, by seasonable counsel and advice, by
   kind and gentle reproof, but especially by a holy and exemplary
   conversation, by a shining virtue, which hath a silent power of
   persuasion, and I know not what secret charm and attraction to draw and
   allure others to the imitation of it.

   III. And in order to both these, the saving of ourselves and others,
   this work which God hath given us to do in the world, consists in the
   careful use and good husbandry of our time; for without this, neither
   the one nor the other can be promoted and carried on to any purpose.
   Time is the season and opportunity of carrying on of any work, and for
   that reason is one of the most valuable things; and yet nothing is more
   wastefully spent, and more prodigally squandered away by a great part
   of mankind than this, which, next to our immortal souls, is of all
   other things most precious; because, upon the right use or abuse of our
   time, our eternal happiness or misery does depend. Men have generally
   some guard upon themselves, as to their money and estates, and will not
   with eyes open suffer others to rob and deprive them of it: but we will
   let any body almost rob us of our time; and are contented to expose
   this precious treasure to every body's rapines and extortion, and can
   quietly look on, whilst men thrust in their hands, and take it out by
   whole handfuls, as if it were of no greater value than silver was in
   Solomon's days, no more than "the stones in the street." And yet when
   it is gone, all the silver and gold in the world cannot purchase and
   fetch back the least moment of it, when perhaps we would give all the
   world for a very small part of that time, which we parted with upon
   such cheap and easy terms.

   Good God! what a stupid and senseless prodigality is this! do we
   consider what we do, when we give away such large portions of our time
   to our ease and pleasure, to diversion and idleness, to trilling and
   unprofitable conversation, to the making and receiving of impertinent
   visits, and the usual and almost inseparable attendants thereof,
   spiteful observations upon them that are present, and slandering and
   backbiting those that are absent, (for the great design of most people
   in visits, is not to better one another, but to spy and make faults,
   and not to mend them; to get time off their hands, to shew their fine
   clothes, and to recommend themselves to the mutual contempt of one
   another, by a plentiful impertinence;) when we part with it by
   wholesale in sleep and dressings, and can spend whole mornings between
   the comb and the glass, and the after noon at plays, and whole nights
   in gaming, or in riot, and lewdness, and intemperance; in all which,
   people commonly waste their money and their time together!

   Nay, how do even the best of us misplace this precious treasure; and
   though we do not employ it to wicked purposes, and in works of
   iniquity, yet we do not apply it to the best and noblest use--to the
   glory of God, and the good and salvation of men; by thus laying out
   this treasure, we might "lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven," and
   help others on in the way thither.

   Thus our blessed Saviour employed his precious time, in "going about
   doing good," in all kinds and upon all occasions, healing the bodies
   and enlightening the minds, and saving the souls of men: this was his
   business, and this was his delight; it was his "meat and drink," and
   his very life, he spent himself in it, and sacrificed his ease, and his
   safety, and his life, to these great ends for which he came into the
   world: he considered the goodness and the greatness of his work, and
   the little time he had to do it in, which made him incessantly
   industrious in it, and to run the race which was set before him with
   great speed, and to "work while it is day," because he knew the night
   would come "when no man can work." And this brings me to the

   Second thing I observed from the text; namely, that there is a certain
   and limited time for every man to do this work in; "while it is day--I
   must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day." And this
   day comprehends all the opportunities of our life, which will be soon
   over, and therefore had need to be well spent. A great part of our rife
   is past before the season of working begins: it is a great while before
   the use of our reason begins, and we come to have our senses exercised
   to discern between good and evil; before our understandings are ripe
   for the serious consideration of God and religion, and for the due care
   of our souls, and for the eternal concernment of another world; so that
   this first part of our life is in a great measure useless and
   unprofitable to us, in regard to our great design. For infancy and
   childhood are but the dawnings of this day, and no fit time to work in;
   and youth, which is as the morning of this day, though it is the flower
   of our time, and the most proper season of all other for the
   remembrance of God and the impressions of religion; yet it is usually
   possessed by vanity and vice; the common custom and practice of the
   world, hath devoted this best part of our age to the worst employments,
   to the service of sin and of our lusts. How very few are there that lay
   hold of this opportunity, and employ it to the best purposes? And yet
   the following course of our lives doth in a great measure depend upon
   it; for most persons do continue and hold on in the way in which they
   set out at first, whether it be good or bad. And those who neglect to
   improve this first opportunity of their lives, do seldom recover
   themselves afterwards. God's grace may seize upon men in any part of
   their lives; but, according to the most ordinary methods of it, the
   foundations and principles of religion and virtue are most commonly
   laid in a pious and virtuous education. This is the great opportunity
   of our lives, which settleth and fixeth most men, either in a good or
   bad course; and the fortune of their whole lives does usually follow
   it, and depend upon it.

   It is true, indeed, our day continues many times a great while longer,
   and we are to work while it continues^ and it is never too late to
   begin to do well, and to enter upon a good course; but there is no such
   proper and advantageous season for the beginning of this work, as in
   our youth and tender years. "This is the accepted time, this is the day
   of salvation." God's grace is then most forward and ready to assist us;
   and we are then least of all in disposed for the receiving of the
   impressions of it; and the impressions of it do then go deepest into
   our minds, and are most lasting and durable. But if we neglect this
   opportunity, we provoke God, by degrees, to withdraw his grace, and to
   take away his Holy Spirit from us, and by degrees we settle in vicious
   habits, and are every day more and more hardened through the
   deceitfulness of sin. It is never too late to work while the day lasts;
   but the sooner we begin this work, and set about it in good earnest,
   the easier we shall find it; if we defer it late, every step. will be
   up the hill, and against the grain.

   Thirdly, After this season is expired, there will be no further
   opportunity of working; when this day is once at an end, then cometh
   the night "when no man can work." The night is a time unfit for work,
   when we can hardly do any thing, if we had never so great mind to it;
   and there is such a night coining upon every one of us, and woe be to
   us if we have our work to do when the night overtakes us.

   There is usually an evening before this night, when it will be very
   difficult for us, and next to impossible, to do this work; and this is
   the time of sickness and old age, in which men are commonly unlit for
   any work, but most of all, that which requires the whole force and
   vigour of our minds, the business of religion. If we attempt this work
   then, we shall go very heartlessly about it, and do it very
   imperfectly, and be forced to slubber it over, and to huddle it up in
   great haste and confusion, and so as we can hardly hope that God will
   accept it. For how unfit are men to do any thing, when they are full of
   the sense of their own infirmities, and life itself is become so great
   a burden to them, that they are hardly able to stand under it! How
   incapable shall we then be of doing the greatest and most momentous
   work of our lives, when our faculties are almost quite spent and worn
   out, and all the powers of life are decayed in us; when our
   understandings are dark and dull, our memories frail and treacherous,
   and our hearts hard and "deceitful above all things!" When sickness and
   old age overtake us, we shall then find to our sorrow, that "sufficient
   for that day is the evil thereof;" we shall have need then of nothing
   else to do, but to bear our infirmities with patience and decency; and
   it is well if we can rally together, of the broken forces of our
   reason, so much as may be a sufficient guard to us against peevishness
   and discontent; we had need then have nothing else to do, but to be old
   and weak, to be sick and die.

   Besides, how can we expect that God should accept of any work that we
   do at such a time? With what face can we put off God with the dregs of
   our life? or how can we hope that he will be pleased with the service
   of those years, which we ourselves "take no pleasure in? if we offer
   the lame in sacrifice, is it not evil? and if we offer the blind, is it
   not evil? offer it now to thy governor, and see if he will be pleased
   with thee."

   And sickness is commonly as bad a time as old age, and usually
   encumbered with greater difficulties, and clogged with more
   indispositions. If a violent distemper seize upon us, it many times
   takes away the use of our reason, and deprives us of all opportunity of
   consideration; it makes us both insensible of the danger of our
   condition, and incapable of using the means to avoid it. And if we have
   neglected religion before, and have put off the great work of our life
   to the end of it, our opportunity is irrecoverably lost; for there is
   nothing to be done in religion when our reason is once departed from
   us; the night is then come indeed, and darkness hath overtaken us; and
   though we be still alive, yet are we as unfit for any work, as if we
   were naturally dead.

   And this is no such rare and extraordinary case; for it happens to
   many; and every man that wilfully defers the work of religion and
   repentance to a dying hour, hath reason to fear that he shall be thus
   surprised in his sin and security, and by the just judgment of God
   deprived of all the opportunity of life and salvation, while he is yet
   in the land of the living.

   But if God be more merciful unto us, and visit us with such a sickness
   as leaves us the use of our understandings, yet all that we do in
   religion, at such a time, proceeds from so violent a cause, from the
   present (error of death, and the dreadful apprehension of that eternal
   misery which is just ready to swallow us up, that it is one of the
   hardest things in the world, not only for others, but even for
   ourselves, to know whether our resolutions, and this sudden and hasty
   fit of repentance, be sincere or not: for it is natural, and almost
   unavoidable, for a man to repent, and be sorry for what he hath done,
   when he is going to execution; but the great question is, what this man
   would do if his life were spared? whether his repentance would hold
   good, and he would become a new man, and change his former course of
   life, or relapse into it again? And it is by no means certain that he
   would not be as bad as he was before: because we see many, who, when
   they lie upon a sick bed, give all imaginable testimony of a deep
   sorrow, and a hearty repentance for their sins, who yet, upon their
   recovery, return to their former sins with a greater appetite, and make
   themselves ten times more the children of wrath than they were before.
   So that all the work that we can do at such a time ought not to be much
   reckoned upon, and can give us little or no comfort; because it is so
   infinitely uncertain whether it be real and sincere, and whether the
   effect of so violent a cause would last and continue if the cause were
   removed. Therefore we should "work while it is day;" for whatever we do
   in this evening of our lives, will be done with great difficulty, and
   with very doubtful success.

   But, besides this evening, there is a night coming, "when no man can
   work: death will seize upon us, and then our state will be
   irrecoverably concluded: after that it will be impossible for us to do
   any thing towards our own salvation, or to have any thing done for us
   by others; the prayers of the living will not avail the dead; "as the
   tree falls, so it lies; there is no wisdom, nor counsel, nor device in
   the grave" whither we are going; therefore, according to the counsel of
   the wise man, "what our hand findeth to do, let us do it with our
   might."

   This counsel concerns all ages and persons. I will apply it to the
   young, in the words of the wise preacher: (Eccles. xii. 1.) "Remember,
   now, thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come
   not, nor the years draw nigh, when them shalt say, I have no pleasure
   in them." To them who are in the vigour of their age, in the words of
   the prophet, (Isa. lv. 6.) "Seek the Lord while he may be found, call
   ye upon him while he is near." And, to them that are old, in the words
   of another prophet, (Jer. xiii. 16.) "Give glory to the Lord your God,
   before he causeth darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark
   mountains, and while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of
   death, and make it gross darkness." And let us, every one of us, of
   what age or condition soever, apply it to ourselves, in the words of
   our blessed Saviour here in the text: "I must work the works of him
   that sent me while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work."

SERMON CI.

  OF THE GREAT DUTIES OF NATURAL RELIGION, WITH THE WAYS AND MEANS OF KNOWING
  THEM.

   Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high
   God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a
   year old?

   Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands
   of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the
   fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

   He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
   require of thee, but, to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
   humbly with thy God?--Micah vi. 6, 7, 8.

   IN the beginning of this chapter, the prophet tells the people of
   Israel, that the Lord had a controversy with them; and, that he might
   direct them how to take up this quarrel, he brings in one making this
   inquiry in the name of the people: "Wherewith shall I come before the
   Lord, and how myself before the high God: That is, by what kind of
   worship or devotion may I address myself to him in the most acceptable
   manner? by what means may I hope to appease his displeasure? To satisfy
   this inquiry, he first instanceth in the chief kinds of sacrifices and
   expiations that were in use among the Jews and heathens: "Shall I come
   before him with burnt-offerings?" the constant sacrifice that was
   offered to God by way of acknowledgment of his dominion over the
   creatures; "with calves of a year old?" which was the sin-offering
   which the high-priest offered for himself. Or, will he rather accept of
   those great and costly sacrifices which were offered upon solemn and
   public occasions, such as that was which Solomon offered at the
   dedication of the temple? "Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of
   rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?" Or, if none of these
   will do, shall I try to atone him, after the manner of the heathen, by
   the dearest thing in the world, the first-born of my children? "Shall I
   give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the
   sin of my soul?" If God was to be appeased at all, surely, they
   thought, it must be by some of these ways; for, beyond these, they
   could imagine nothing of greater value and efficacy.

   But the prophet tells them, that they were quite out of the way in
   thinking to pacify God upon these terms? that there are other things
   which are much better and more pleasing to him than any of these
   sacrifices. For some of them were expressly for bidden by God, as "the
   offering up of our children;" and, for the rest, they were not good in
   themselves, but merely by virtue of their institution, and because they
   were commanded. But the things which he would recommend to them are
   such as are good in their own nature, and required of us by God upon
   that account. "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
   the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to
   walk humbly with thy God?"

   So that in these words you have,

   First, An inquiry which is the best way to appease God when he is
   offended? "Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself
   before the high God?"

   Secondly, The way that men are apt to take in this case; and that is,
   by some external piece of religion and devotion; such as were
   sacrifices both among Jews and heathens. "Shall I come before him with
   burnt-offerings," &c. By which question the prophet intimates, that men
   are very apt to pitch upon this course.

   Thirdly, The course which God himself directs to, and which will
   effectually pacify him. "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and
   what doth the Lord thy God require of thee," &c.

   The first being a mere question, there needs no more to be said of it;
   only, that it is a question of great importance: what is the most
   effectual way to appease God when we have offended him? For who can
   bear his indignation; and who can stand before him when once he is
   angry? Let us consider, then, in the

   Second place, The way that men are apt to take to pacify God; and that
   is, by some external piece of religion and devotion; such as were
   sacrifices among the Jews and heathens. "Shall I come before him with
   burnt-offering?" This is the way which men are most apt to choose. The
   Jews, you see, pitched upon the external parts of their religion; those
   which were most pompous and solemn; the richest and most costly
   sacrifices; so they might but keep their sins they were well enough
   content to offer up any thing else to God; they thought nothing too
   good for him, provided he would not oblige them to become better.

   And thus it is among ourselves, when we apprehend God is displeased
   with us, and his judgments are abroad in the earth, we are content to
   do any thing but to learn righteousness; we are willing to submit to
   any kind of external devotion and humiliation, to fast and pray, to
   afflict ourselves and to cry mightily unto God; things some of them
   good in themselves, but the least part of that which God requires of
   us.

   And as for the church of Rome, in case of public judgments and
   calamities, they are the most inquisitive and (as they pretend) the
   most skilful people in the world to pacify God; and they have a
   thousand solemn devices to this purpose. I do not wrong them by
   representing them inquiring after this manner: "Shall I go before a
   crucifix, and bow myself to it, as to the high God? And because the
   Lord is a great King, and it is, perhaps, too much boldness and
   arrogancy to make immediate addresses always to him; to which of the
   saints or angels shall I go to mediate for me, and intercede on my
   behalf? Will the Lord be pleased with thou sands of paternosters, or
   with ten thousands of Ave-Marias? Shall the host travel in procession,
   or my self undertake a tedious pilgrimage? Or shall I list myself a
   soldier for the holy war, or for the extirpation of heretics? Shall I
   give half my estate to a convent for my transgression, or chastise and
   punish my body for the sin of my soul?" Thus men deceive themselves,
   and will submit to all the extravagant severities that the petulancy
   and folly of men can devise and impose upon them. And, indeed, it is
   not to be imagined, when men are once under the power of superstition,
   how ridiculous they may be, and yet think themselves religious! how
   prodigiously they may play the fool, and yet believe they please God;
   what cruel and barbarous things they may do to themselves and others,
   and yet be verily persuaded they do God good service.

   And what is the mystery of all this, but that men are loath to do that,
   without which nothing else that we do is acceptable to God? They hate
   to be reformed; and for this reason they will be content to do any
   thing rather than be put to the trouble of mending themselves: every
   thing is easy in comparison of this task, and God may have any terms of
   them, so he will let them be quiet in their sins, and excuse them from
   the real virtues of a good life. And this brings me to the

   Third thing which I principally intended to speak to: The course which
   God himself directs to, and which will effectually pacify him. "He hath
   shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of
   thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
   God?" In the handling of which I shall

   First, Consider those several duties which God here requires of us, and
   upon the performance of which he will be pacified towards us.

   Secondly, By what ways and means God hath discovered these duties to
   us, and the goodness of them: "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is
   good," &c.

   I. We will briefly consider the several duties which God here requires
   of us, and upon the performance of which he will be pacified towards
   us. "What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love
   mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"

   It was usual among the Jews to reduce all the duties of religion to
   these three heads: justice, mercy, and piety; under the first two,
   comprehending the duties which we owe to one another; and, under the
   third, the duties which we owe to God.

   1. Justice. And I was going to tell you what it is, but I considered
   that every man knows it as well as any definition can explain it to
   him. I shall only put you in mind of some of the principal instances of
   it, and the several virtues comprehended under it. And,

   First, Justice is concerned in the making of laws, that they be such as
   are equal and reasonable, useful and beneficial, for the honour of God
   and religion, and for the public good of human society; this is a great
   trust, in the discharge of which, if men be biassed by favour or
   interest, and drawn aside from the consideration and regard of the
   public good, it is a far greater crime, and of worse consequence, than
   any private act of injustice between man and man.

   And, then, justice is also concerned in the due execution of laws;
   which are the guard of private property, the security of public peace
   and of religion and good manners. And,

   Lastly, In the observance of laws and obedience to them; which is a
   debt that every man owes to human society.

   But more especially, justice is concerned in the observance of those
   laws, whether of God or man, which respect the rights of men, and their
   mutual commerce and intercourse with one another. That we use honesty
   and integrity in all our dealings, in opposition to fraud and deceit;
   truth and fidelity, in opposition to falsehood and breach of trust;
   equity and good conscience, in opposition to all kind of oppression and
   exaction. These are the principal branches and instances of this great
   and comprehensive duty of justice; the violation whereof is so much the
   greater sin, because this virtue is the firmest bond of human society,
   upon the observation whereof the peace and happiness of mankind does so
   much depend.

   2. Mercy, which does not only signify the in ward affection of pity and
   compassion towards those that are in misery and necessity, but the
   effects of it, in the actual relief of those whose condition calls for
   our charitable help and assistance; by feeding the hungry, and clothing
   the naked, and visiting the sick, and vindicating the oppressed, and
   comforting the afflicted, and ministering ease and relief to them if it
   be in our power. And this is a very lovely virtue, and argues more
   goodness in men than mere justice doth. For justice is a strict debt;
   but mercy is favour and kindness. And this, perhaps, may be the reason
   of the different expressions in the text, that when God barely commands
   us to do justly, he requires we should love mercy; that is, take a
   particular pleasure and delight in the exercise of this virtue, which
   is so proper and agreeable to mankind, that we commonly call it
   humanity; giving it its name from our very nature. In short, it is so
   excellent a virtue that I should be very sorry that any religion should
   be able to pretend to the practice of it more than our own.

   3. Piety; "To walk humbly with thy God." "To walk humbly in the fear of
   the Lord;" so the Chaldee paraphrase renders these words. And (his
   phrase may comprehend all those acts of religion which refer
   immediately to God; a firm belief of his being and perfections; an
   awful sense of him as the dread Sovereign and righteous Judge of the
   world; a due regard to his service, and a reverent behaviour of
   ourselves towards him in all acts of worship and religion, in
   opposition to atheism and a profane neglect and contempt of God and
   religion; a new and monstrous kind of impiety! which of late years hath
   broke in upon us, and got head among us, not only contrary to the
   example of former ages, but in despite of the very genius and temper of
   the nation, which is naturally devout and zealous in religion.

   Or else this phrase of "walking humbly with God," may refer more
   particularly to the posture and condition of the people of Israel at
   that time, who were fallen under the heavy displeasure of God for their
   sins. And then the duty required is, that being sensible how highly God
   hath been offended by us, by the general corruption and viciousness of
   the age, which, like a leprosy, hath spread itself almost over the
   whole body of the nation, and by that open lewdness and those insolent
   impieties which are daily committed amongst us; I say, that, being
   deeply sensible of this, we do, with all humility, acknowledge our sins
   to God, and repent of them, and implore his mercy and forgiveness, and
   resolve by his grace to turn every one from the evil of our ways, and
   from the wickedness that is in our hands; which God grant we may every
   one do this day [2] according to the pious design and intention of it.
   And, if we be sincere in this resolution, "who can tell but God will
   turn and repent, and turn away his anger from us, that we perish not."
   Nay, we have great reason to believe, that he will be pacified towards
   us. So he hath declared: (Isa. i. 10.) "Wash ye, make you clean, put
   away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil,
   learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the
   fatherless, plead for the widow: come now, and let us reason together,
   saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white
   as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." But
   if we continue unreformed, God will say to us, as he does there to the
   people of Israel, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices
   unto me? your calling of assemblies I cannot away with, it is iniquity,
   even the solemn meeting; and when ye spread forth your hands, I will
   hide mine eyes from you; when ye make many prayers, I will not hear."
   To which, let me add that excellent saying of the son of Sirach to this
   purpose: (Ecclus. xxxiv. 25, 26.) "He that washeth himself after the
   touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what availeth his
   washing? So is it with a man that fasteth for his sins, and goeth again
   and doth the same things. Who will hear his prayer, or what doth his
   humbling profit him?"

   II. Let us consider by what ways and means God hath made known those
   duties to us, and the goodness and the obligation of them. "He hath
   shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of
   thee?" I shall mention five ways whereby God hath discovered this to
   us.

   1. By a kind of natural instinct.

   2. By natural reason.

   3. By the general vote and consent of mankind.

   4. By external revelation.

   5. By the inward dictates and motions of God's Spirit upon the minds of
   men.

   First, By a kind of natural instinct, by which I mean a secret
   impression upon the minds of men, whereby they are naturally carried to
   approve some things as good and fit, and to dislike other things, as
   having a native evil and deformity in them. And this I call a natural
   instinct, because it does not seem to proceed so much from the exercise
   of our reason, as from a natural propension and inclination, like those
   instincts which are in brute creatures of natural affection and care
   toward their young ones. And that these inclinations are precedent to
   all reason and discourse about them, evidently appears by this, that
   they do put forth themselves every whit as vigorously in young persons
   as in those of riper reason; in the rude and ignorant sort of people,
   as in those who are more polished and refined. For we see plainly that
   the young and ignorant have as strong impressions of piety and
   devotion, as true a sense of gratitude and justice and pity, as the
   wiser and more knowing part of mankind. A plain indication that the
   reason of mankind is prevented by a kind of natural instinct and
   anticipation concerning the good or evil, the comeliness or deformity
   of these things. And though this do not equally extend to all the
   instances of our duty, yet as to the great lines and essential parts of
   it, mankind hardly need to consult any other oracle than the mere
   propensions and inclinations of their nature: as, whether we ought to
   reverence the Divine nature, to be grateful to those who have conferred
   benefits upon us, to speak the truth, to be faithful to our promise, to
   restore that which is committed to us in trust, to pity and relieve
   those that are in misery, and in all things to do to others as we would
   have them do to us. And this will further appear, if we consider these
   two things:

   1. That men are naturally innocent or guilty to themselves, according
   to what they do in these things. So the apostle tells us: (Rom. ii. 14,
   15.) "When the gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
   things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto
   themselves, and do shew the effect of the law written in their hearts,
   their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts, by turns,
   (that is, according as they do well or ill) accusing or excusing them."
   There is a secret comfort in innocence, and a strange pleasure and
   satisfaction in being acquitted by our own minds for what we do. But,
   on the contrary, when we contradict these natural dictates, what
   uneasiness do we find in our own breasts? Nay, even before the fact is
   committed, our conscience is strangely disquieted at the thoughts of
   it. When a man does but design to do a bad thing, he is as guilty to
   himself as if he had committed it. Of this we have a considerable
   instance, in the first violence that was offered to nature: (Gen. iv.
   6.) "The Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth, and why is thy
   countenance fallen?" The very thought of that wickedness which he did
   but then design, did disorder his mind, and make a change in his very
   countenance. Guilt is the natural concomitant of heinous crimes; which
   so soon as ever a man commits, his spirit receives a secret wound,
   which causeth a great deal of smart and anguish. For guilt is restless,
   and puts the mind of man into an unnatural working and fermentation,
   never to be settled again but by repentance. "The wicked are like the
   troubled sea when it cannot rest;" which plainly shews that the mind of
   man hath a kind of natural sense of good and evil; because, whenever we
   offend against nature, our consciences are touched to the quick, and we
   receive a sting into our soul, which shoots and pains us, whenever we
   reflect upon what we have done. I appeal to that witness, which every
   man carries in his breast, whether this be not true.

   2. Men are naturally full of hopes and fears, according as they follow
   or go against these natural dictates. A good conscience is apt to fill
   men with confidence and good hopes. It does not only give ease, but
   security to the mind of man, against the dread of invisible powers, and
   the fearful apprehensions of a future judgment. Whereas guilt fills men
   with dismal apprehensions of danger, and continual misgivings
   concerning their own safety. Thus it was with Cain, after he had slain
   his brother: "It shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me
   shall slay me." Nay, when a man hath done a secret fault, which none
   can accuse him of, yet then is he haunted with the terrors of his own
   mind, and cannot be secure in his own apprehensions: which plainly
   shews, that men are conscious to themselves, when they do well, and
   when they do amiss; and that the same natural instinct which prompts
   men to their duty, fills them with good hopes when they have done it,
   and with secret fears and apprehensions of danger when they have done
   contrary to it.

   Secondly, God shews man what is good, by natural reason; and that two
   ways: by the convenience of things to our nature; and by their tendency
   to our happiness and interest.

   First, Reason shews us the convenience of things to our nature; and
   whatever is agreeable to the primitive design and intention of nature,
   that we call good; whatever is contrary thereto, we call evil. For
   example, to honour and love God. It is natural to honour great power
   and perfection, and to love goodness wherever it is. So, likewise,
   gratitude is natural, to acknowledge benefits received, and to be ready
   to requite them; and the contrary is monstrous, and universally
   abhorred; and there is no greater sign that any thing is contrary to
   nature, than if it be detested by the whole kind. It is agreeable also
   to nature to be just, and to do to others as we would have them to do
   to us; for this is to make our own natural inclinations and desires the
   rule of our dealing with others, and to be merciful; for no man that
   hath not divested himself of humanity, ran be cruel and hard-hearted to
   others, without feeling a pain in himself.

   Secondly, Reason shews us the tendency of these things to our happiness
   and interest. And, indeed, the notion of good and evil does commonly
   refer to the consequences of things; and we call that good, which will
   bring some benefit and advantage to us, and that evil which is likely
   to produce some mischief and inconvenience j and by this rule reason
   discovers to us that these duties are good.

   To begin with piety towards God. Nothing can more evidently tend to our
   interest, than to make him our friend, upon whose favour our happiness
   depends. So likewise for gratitude: it is a virtue, to which, if nature
   did not prompt us, our intent would direct us; for every man is ready
   to place benefits there where he may hope for a thankful return.
   Temperance does apparently conduce to our health, which, next to a good
   conscience, is the most pleasant and valuable thing in the world;
   whereas the intemperate man is an open enemy to himself, and
   continually making assaults upon his own life. Mercy and pity are not
   more welcome to others, than they are delightful and beneficial to
   ourselves; for we do not only gratify our own nature and bowels, by
   relieving those who are in misery, but we provoke mankind by our
   example to the like tenderness, and do prudently bespeak the
   commiseration of others towards us, when it shall be our turn to stand
   in need of it. And, if we be wise enough, our reason will likewise
   direct us to be just, as the surest art of thriving in this world; it
   gives a man a reputation, which is a powerful advantage in all the
   affairs of this world; it is the shortest and easiest way of
   dispatching business, the plainest, and least entangled; and though it
   be not so sudden a way of growing rich, as fraud and oppression, yet it
   is much surer and more lasting, and not liable to those terrible
   back-blows and after-reckonings, to which estates got by injustice are.

   And natural reason does not only shew us that these things are good,
   but that the Lord requires them of us; that is, that they have the
   force and obligation of laws: for there needs nothing more to make any
   thing a law, than a sufficient declaration that it is the will of God;
   and this God hath sufficiently signified to mankind by the very frame
   of our natures, and of those principles and faculties which he hath
   endued us withal; so that, whenever we act contrary to these, we
   plainly disobey the will of him that made us, and violate those laws
   which he hath enacted in our natures, and written upon our hearts.

   And this is all the law that the greatest part of mankind were under,
   before the revelation of the gospel. From Adam to Moses, the world was
   al most solely governed by the natural law; which seems to be the
   meaning of that hard text, (Rom. v. 13.) "For until the law sin was in
   the world;" that is, before the law of Moses was given, men were
   capable of offending against some other law, for otherwise sin could
   not have been imputed to them; for "sin is not imputed where there is
   no law." And then it follows: "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
   Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of
   Adam's transgression;" that is, during that space from Adam to Moses,
   men sinned against the natural law, and were liable to death upon that
   account, though they had not offended against an express revelation
   from God, as Adam had done; for that the apostle seems to mean, by
   sinning after the similitude of Adam's transgression.

   Thirdly, God hath shewn us what is good by the general vote and consent
   of mankind. Not that all mankind do agree concerning virtue and vice;
   but that as to the greater duties of piety, justice, mercy, and the
   like, the exceptions are but few in comparison, and not enough to
   infringe a general consent. And of this I shall offer to you this
   threefold evidence.

   1. That these virtues are generally praised and held in esteem by
   mankind, and the contrary vices generally reproved and evil spoken of.
   Now to praise any thing, is to give testimony to the goodness of it;
   and to censure any thing, is to declare that we believe it to be evil.
   And if we consult the history of all ages, we shall find, that the
   things which are generally praised in the lives of men, and recommended
   to the imitation of posterity, are piety and devotion, gratitude and
   justice, humanity and charity; and that the contrary to these are
   marked with ignominy and reproach: the former are commended even in
   enemies, and the latter are branded even by those who had a kindness
   for the persons that were guilty of them. So constant hath mankind
   always been in the commendation of virtue, and in the censure of vice.
   Nay, we find not only those who are virtuous themselves giving their
   testimony and applause to virtue, but even those who are vicious; not
   out of love to goodness, but from the conviction of their own minds,
   and from a secret reverence they bear to the common consent and opinion
   of mankind. And this is a great testimony, because it is the testimony
   of an enemy extorted by the mere light and force of truth.

   And, on the contrary, nothing is more ordinary than for vice to reprove
   sin, and to hear men condemn the like, or the same things in others,
   which they allow in themselves. And this is a clear evidence, that vice
   is generally condemned by mankind, that many men condemn it in
   themselves; and those who are so kind as to spare themselves, are very
   quick-sighted to spy a fault in any body else, and will censure a bad
   action done by another with as much freedom and impartiality as the
   most virtuous man in the world.

   As to this consent of mankind about virtue and vice, the Scripture
   frequently appeals. As when it commands us "to provide things honest in
   the sight of all men; and by well-doing to put to silence the ignorance
   of foolish men;" intimating, that there are some things so confessedly
   good, and owned to be such by so general a vote of mankind, that the
   worst of men have not the face to open their mouths against them. And
   it is made the character of a virtuous action, if it be lovely and
   commendable, and "of good report: (Phil. iv. 8.) Whatsoever things are
   lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue,
   if there be any praise," make account of these things; intimating to
   us, that mankind do generally concur in the praise and commendation of
   what is virtuous.

   2. Men do generally glory and stand upon their innocency, when they do
   virtuously; but are ashamed, and out of countenance, when they do the
   contrary. Now glory and shame are nothing else but an appeal to the
   judgment of others, concerning the good or evil of our actions. There
   are, indeed, some such monsters as are impudent in their impieties, but
   these are but few in comparison. Generally mankind is modest; the
   greatest part of those who do evil are apt to blush at their own
   faults, and to confess them in their countenance, which is an
   acknowledgment that they are not only guilty to themselves that they
   have done amiss, but that they are apprehensive that others think so.
   For guilt is a passion respecting ourselves, but shame regards others.
   Now it is a sign of shame, that men love to conceal their faults from
   others, and commit them secretly, in the dark, and without witnesses,
   and are afraid even of a child or a fool: or, if they be discovered in
   them, they are solicitous to excuse and extenuate them, and ready to
   lay the fault upon any body else, or to transfer their guilt, or as
   much of it as they can, upon others. All which are certain tokens that
   men are not only naturally guilty to themselves, when they commit a
   fault, but that they are sensible also what opinions others have of
   these things.

   And, on the contrary, men are apt to stand upon their justification,
   and to glory when they have done well. The conscience of a man's own
   virtue and integrity lifts up his head, and gives him confidence before
   others, because he is satisfied they have a good opinion of his
   actions. What a good face does a man naturally set upon a good deed!
   And how does he sneak when he hath done wickedly, being sensible that
   he is condemned by others, as well as by himself! No man is afraid of
   being upbraided for having dealt honestly or kindly with others, nor
   does account it any calumny or reproach to have it reported of him that
   he is a sober and chaste man. No man blusheth when he meets a man with
   whom he hath kept his word and discharged his trust: but every man is
   apt to do so, when he meets one with whom he has dealt dishonestly, or
   who knows some notorious crime by him.

   3. Vice is generally forbidden and punished by human laws; but against
   the contrary virtues there never was any law. Some vices are so
   manifestly evil in themselves, or so mischievous to human society, that
   the laws of most nations have taken care to discountenance them by
   severe penalties. Scarce any nation was ever so barbarous as not to
   maintain and vindicate the honour of their gods and religion by public
   laws. Murder and adultery, rebellion and sedition, perjury and breach
   of trust, fraud and oppression, are vices severely prohibited by the
   laws of most nations: a clear indication what opinion the generality of
   mankind, and the wisdom of nations, have always had of these things.

   But now against the contrary virtues there never was any law. No man
   was ever impeached for living "soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
   present world:" a plain acknowledgment, that mankind always thought
   them good, and never were sensible of the inconvenience of them; for
   had they been so, they would have provided against them by laws. This
   St. Paul takes notice of as a great commendation of the Christian
   virtues: "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
   gentleness, kindness, fidelity, meekness, temperance; against such
   there is no law:" the greatest evidence that could be given that these
   things are unquestionably good in the esteem of mankind--"against such
   there is no law." As if he had said, turn over the law of Moses, search
   those of Athens, and Sparta, and the twelve tables of the Romans, and
   those innumerable laws that have been added since, and you shall not,
   in any of them, find any of those virtues that I have mentioned
   condemned and forbid den: a clear evidence that mankind never took any
   exception against them, but are generally agreed about the goodness of
   them.

   Fourthly, God hath shewn us what is good by external revelation. In
   former ages of the world, God revealed his will to particular persons
   in an extraordinary manner, and more especially to the nation of the
   Jews; the rest of the world being, in a great measure, left to the
   conduct of natural light, lint, in these latter ages, he hath made
   public revelation of his will by his Son: and this, as to the matter of
   our duty, is the same in substance with the law of nature; for our
   Saviour comprehends all under these two general heads--the love of God
   and of our neighbour. The apostle reduceth all to three; sobriety,
   justice, and piety: "The grace of God, that brings salvation, hath
   appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly
   lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
   world." So that, if we believe the apostle, the gospel teacheth us the
   very same things which nature dictated to men before; only it hath made
   a more perfect discovery of them. So that, whatever was doubtful and
   obscure before is now certain and plain; the duties are still the same,
   only it offers us more powerful arguments, and a greater assistance to
   the performance of those duties; so that we may now much better say,
   than the prophet could in his days, "He hath shewed thee, O man, what
   is good; and what it is that the Lord requires of thee."

   Fifthly and lastly, God shews us what is good by the motions of his
   Spirit upon the minds of men. This the Scripture assures us of, and
   good men have experience more especially of it; though it be hard to
   give an account of it, and to say what motions are from the Spirit of
   God, and what from our own minds; for "as the wind blows where it
   listeth, and we hear the sound of it, but know not whence it comes, nor
   whither it goes;" so are the operations of the Spirit of God upon the
   minds of men secret and imperceptible.

   And thus I have done with the three things I propounded to speak to.
   All that now remains is to make some inferences from what hath been
   said, by way of application.

   First, Seeing God hath so abundantly provided that we should know our
   duty, we are altogether inexcusable if we do not do it. Because "he
   hath shewed thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of
   thee;" therefore, "thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art,"
   who livest in a contradiction to this light. God hath acquainted us
   with our duty by such ways as may most effectually both direct and
   engage us to the practice of it; we are prompted to it by a kind of
   natural instinct, and strong impressions upon our minds of the
   difference of good and evil; we are led to the knowledge, and urged to
   the practice of it, by our nature, and by our reason, and by our
   interest, and by that which is commonly very prevalent among men, the
   general voice and consent of mankind; and by the most powerful and
   governing passions in human nature, by hope, and by fear, and by shame;
   by the prospect of advantage, by the apprehension of danger, and by the
   sense of honour; and, to take away all possible excuse of ignorance
   from us, by an express revelation from God, the clearest and most
   perfect that ever was made to the world. So that, whenever we do
   contrary to our duty, in any of these great instances, we offend
   against all these, and do, in the highest degree, fall under the heavy
   sentence of our Saviour: "This is the condemnation, that light is come
   into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light."

   Secondly, You see hence what are the great duties of religion, which
   God mainly requires of us, and how reasonable they are; piety towards
   God, and justice and charity towards men; the knowledge whereof is
   planted in our nature, and grows up with our reason. And these are
   things which are unquestionably good, and against which we can have no
   exception; things that were never reproved nor found fault with by
   mankind, neither our nature nor our reason riseth up against them, or
   dictates any thing to the contrary. We have all the obligation, and we
   have all the encouragement to them, and are secure on all hands in the
   practice of them. In the doing of these things, there is no danger to
   us from the laws of men, no fear of displeasure from God, no offence or
   sting from our own minds.

   And these things, which are so agreeable to our nature, and our reason,
   and our interest, are the great things which our religion requires of
   us, more valuable in themselves, and more acceptable to God than "whole
   burnt-offerings and sacrifices," more than "thousands of rams, and ten
   thousands of rivers of oil; "more than if we offered to him "all the
   beasts of the forest, and the cattle upon a thousand hills." We are not
   to neglect any institution of God; but, above all, we are to secure the
   observance of those great duties to which we are directed by our very
   nature, and tied by the surest and most sacred of all other laws, those
   which God hath riveted in our souls, and written upon our hearts: and
   that mankind might have no pretence left to excuse them from these, the
   Christian religion hath set us free from those many positive and
   outward observances, that the Jewish religion was encumbered withal;
   that we might be wholly intent upon these great duties, and mind
   nothing in comparison of the real and substantial virtues of a good
   life.

   Thirdly, You see, in the last place, what is the best way to appease
   the displeasure of God towards a sinful nation. God seems to have as
   great a controversy with us, as he had with the people of Israel, and
   his wrath is of late years most visibly gone out against us; and
   proportionably to the full measure of our sins, it hath been poured out
   upon us in full vials. How have the judgments of God followed us? And
   how close have they followed one another? What fearful calamities have
   our eyes seen? enough to make the ears of every one that hears them to
   tingle. What terrible and hazardous wars have we been engaged in? What
   a raging pestilence did God send among us, that swept away thousands
   and ten thousands in our streets? What a dreadful and fatal fire, that
   was not to be checked and resisted in its course, till it had laid in
   ashes one of the greatest and richest cities in the world? What
   unseasonable weather have we had of late? as if for the wickedness of
   men upon the earth, the very ordinances of Heaven were changed, and
   summer, and winter, seed time, and harvest, had forgotten their
   appointed seasons. And, which is more and sadder than all this, what
   dangerous attempts have been made upon our religion, by the restless
   adversaries of it?

   And now, surely, after all this is come upon us for our sins, it is
   time for us to look up to him that smites us, and to think of taking up
   this quarrel. It is time to inquire as they do in the text:
   "Wherewithal shall we come before the Lord, and bow ourselves before
   the high God?" And we are apt to take the same course they did, to
   endeavour to appease God by some external devotion. We have now betaken
   ourselves to prayer and fasting, and it was very fit, nay necessary we
   should so do; but let us not think this is all God expects from us.
   These are but the means to a further cud, to oblige us for the future
   to the practice of a good life. The outward profession of religion is
   not lost amongst us, there appears still in men a great and commendable
   zeal for the reformed religion, and there hath been too much occasion
   for it; but that which God chiefly expects from us, is reformed lives.
   Piety and virtue are, in a great measure, gone from among us, the
   manners of men are strangely corrupted, the great and weighty things of
   the law are neglected, justice and mercy, temperance and chastity,
   truth and fidelity; so that we may take up David's complaint, "Help,
   Lord! for the righteous man ceaseth, for the faithful fail from among
   the children of men."

   And till the nation be brought back to a sober sense of religion, from
   an airy and fantastical piety, to real and unaffected devotion, and
   from a factious contention about things indifferent, to the serious
   practice of what is necessary; from our violent heats and animosities,
   to a more peaceable temper; and by a mutual condescension, on all
   sides, to a nearer and stronger union among ourselves; till we recover
   in some measure our ancient virtue and integrity of manners, we have
   reason to fear that God will still have a controversy with us,
   notwithstanding all our noise and zeal about religion.

   This is the true, this is the only course to appease the indignation of
   God, and to draw down his favour and blessing upon a poor distracted
   and gasping nation. "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what
   doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
   to walk humbly with thy God?"

   I have but one word more, and that is, to put you presently upon the
   practice of one of these duties that I have been persuading you to, and
   that is, mercy and alms to the poor. If what I have al ready said have
   had its effect upon you, I need not use any other arguments; if it have
   not, I have hardly the heart to use any. I shall only put you in mind
   again, that God values this above all our external devotion, "he will
   have mercy rather than sacrifice;" that this is the way to find mercy
   with God, and to have our prayers speed in heaven; and without this,
   all our fasting and humiliation signifies nothing. And to this purpose
   I will only read to you those plain and persuasive words of the
   prophet, which do so fully declare unto us the whole duty of this day,
   and particularly urge us to this of charity: (Isa. lviii. 5-9.) "Is it
   such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? Is
   it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes
   under him? "Wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day unto the
   Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of
   wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go
   free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the
   hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?
   when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not
   thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the
   morning, and thy salvation shall spring forth speedily, and thy
   righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall be
   thy rereward. Then thou shall call, and the Lord shall answer; thou
   shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am."

SERMON CII.

  INSTITUTED RELIGION NOT INTENDED TO UNDERMINE NATURAL.

   But go ye and learn what that meaneth; I will have mercy, and not
   sacrifice.--Matt. ix. 13.

   ONE of the most successful attempts that have been made upon religion,
   by the devil and his instruments, hath been by setting the laws of God
   at variance with themselves, and by dashing the several parts of
   religion, and the two tables of the law against one another, to break
   all in pieces, and, under a pretence of advancing that part of religion
   which is instituted and revealed, to undermine and destroy that which
   is natural, and of primary obligation.

   To manifest and lay open the mischievous consequences of this design, I
   shall at this time (by God's assistance) endeavour to make out these
   two things:

   First, That natural religion is the foundation of all instituted and
   revealed religion.

   Secondly, That no revealed or instituted religion was ever designed to
   takeaway the obligation of natural duties, but to confirm and establish
   them.

   And to this purpose, I have chosen these words of our Saviour for the
   foundation of my following discourse: "But go ye and learn what that
   meaneth; I will have mercy, and not sacrifice." The occasion of which
   words was briefly this: the pharisees found fault with him for keeping
   company, and eating with publicans and sinners. He owns the thing which
   they objected to him, and endeavours to vindicate himself from any
   crime or fault in so doing; and that these two ways:

   1. By telling them that it was allowed to a physician, and proper for
   his office and profession, to converse with the sick, in order to their
   cure and recovery. He may abstain, if he pleaseth, from the
   conversation of others; but the sick have need of him, and are his
   proper care, and his business and employment lies among them: "he said
   unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are
   sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance:
   they, who were already good, needed not to be called upon to amend and
   reform their lives; and they that were so conceited of their own
   righteousness, as the pharisees were, and so confident that they were
   sound and whole, would not admit of a physician, and thereby rendered
   themselves incapable of cure; and therefore he did not apply himself to
   them; but to the publicans and sinners, who were acknowledged, on all
   hands, both by themselves and others, to be bad men; so that it could
   not be denied, to be the proper work of a spiritual physician to
   converse with such persons.

   2. By endeavouring to convince them of their ignorance of the true
   nature of religion, and of the rank and order of the several duties
   thereby required; "But go ye and learn what that meaneth; I will have
   mercy, and not sacrifice;" which saying is quoted by him out of the
   prophet Hosea, (chap. vi. 6.) "I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and
   the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings;" which text our Saviour
   cites and applies upon two several occasions; the considering and
   comparing of which will give full light to the true meaning of it.

   The first is here in the text, upon occasion of the pharisees finding
   fault with him, for conversing with publicans and sinners; the other
   is, (Matt. xii. 7.) where the pharisees blaming the disciples of our
   Saviour for plucking the ears of corn on the sabbath-day, our Saviour
   tells them, "If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and
   not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless;" that is, if
   they had understood the true nature of religion, and what duties of it
   are chiefly and in the first place to be regarded, they would not have
   been so forward to censure this action of his disciples.

   So that the plain meaning of this saying is this: that, in comparing
   the parts of religion and the obligation of duties together, those
   duties which are of moral and natural obligation are most valued by
   God, and ought to take place of those which are positive and ritual. "I
   will have mercy, and not sacrifice;" that is, rather than sacrifice,
   according to the true meaning of this Hebrew phrase, which is to be
   understood in a comparative sense, as is evident from the text itself,
   in Hosea--"I desired mercy, and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God
   rather than burnt-offerings;" if they cannot be observed together, let
   sacrifice be neglected, and the work of mercy be done.

   And the reason of this seems very plain; because shewing mercy, or
   doing good in any kind, is a prime instance of those moral duties,
   which do naturally and perpetually oblige; but sacrifice is an instance
   of positive and ritual observances, and one of the chief of the kind:
   so that when moral duties and ritual observances come in competition,
   and do clash with one another, the observation of a rite, or positive
   institution, is to give way to a moral duty; and it is no sin, in that
   case, to neglect the observation of such a rite, yea, though it were
   commanded and appointed by God himself. And though this may seem to be
   a breach of the letter of the law, yet it is according to the true mind
   and meaning of the law; it being a tacit condition implied in all laws
   of a ritual and positive nature, provided the observance of them be not
   to the hinderance and prejudice of any duty, which is of a higher and
   better nature; in that case, the obligation of it does for that time
   give way and is suspended.

   And this will appear to be the true meaning of this rule, by comparing
   more particularly the in stances to which our Saviour applies it. His
   disciples passing through the corn on the sabbath-day, and being
   hungry, plucked the ears and did eat: this our Saviour doth justify to
   be no breach of the law of the sabbath; because, in that case, and in
   such circumstances, it did not oblige: for the disciples being called
   to attend upon our Saviour, to be instructed by him in the things which
   concerned the kingdom of God; that is, in the doctrine of the gospel,
   which they were to publish to the world this attendance hindered them
   from making necessary provisions against the sabbath, they, in
   obedience to their Master, being intent upon a better work; but that
   they might not starve, the necessities of nature must be provided for;
   and therefore it was fit, that the law of the sabbath, which was but
   positive and ritual, should give way to an act of mercy and
   self-preservation: "if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have
   mercy, and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless."

   And the reason is the same as to any instrumental part of religion, by
   which I mean any thing which may be a means to promote piety and
   goodness; as prayer, hearing the word of God, keeping good company, and
   avoiding bad; the duties of this kind, our Saviour here in the text
   (where he likewise applies this rule), compares with moral duties. To
   avoid the company of vicious and wicked persons, is a good means to
   preserve men from the contagion of their vices, and was always esteemed
   a duty among prudent men, both Jews and heathens, and is no wise
   disallowed by our Saviour: but yet not so a duty as to hinder a greater
   duty, nor so strictly and perversely to be insisted upon, as if one
   ought not to converse with bad men in any case, or upon any account, no
   not for so great and good an end as to reclaim them from their vices.
   In this case we ought to consider, that our first and highest
   obligation is to moral duties, comprehended under the love of God and
   our neighbour; among which, one of the chief is to do good to men, and
   to shew mercy and pity to those that are in misery; and the greatest
   good that one man can do to another, is to be instrumental to reclaim
   him from the evil and error of his way; because this is "to save his
   soul from death;" and we cannot imagine that God ever intended, by any
   rule of prudence or positive constitution of the Jewish law, so to
   forbid their accompanying with bad and scandalous men, that it should
   be unlawful to converse with them in order to their recovery and
   amendment; "Go ye and learn what that meaneth; I will have mercy, and
   not sacrifice."

   And St. Paul was of the same mind in the precepts he gives concerning
   avoiding the company of scandalous Christians: (2 Thess. iii. 14, 15.)
   "And if any man obey not our word by tins epistle, note that man, and
   have no company with him, that he may be ashamed; yet count him not as
   an enemy, but admonish him as a brother." St. Paul qualifies his
   precept, lest Christians should mistake it, and fall into the Jewish
   extreme, not to converse with those whom they esteemed scandalous and
   wicked, upon any account whatsoever, no not in order to their amendment
   and reformation. The bond of intimacy and friendship with bad men ought
   to be broken, and yet the bond of common humanity may be as strong as
   ever. It is one thing to discountenance bad men, to bring them to
   shame, and a sense of their fault; and quite another thing to abandon
   them to ruin: and, even in case of notorious heresy, or wickedness of
   life, it is one thing to cut them off from the society and communion of
   Christians; and quite another, to cut them off from human society, to
   cut their throats, and to extirpate them out of the world.

   And yet the matter was carried thus far by the furious zeal of the
   Jews, when Christianity first appeared in the world; they thought that
   no mercy in such cases was the best that could be done, and the best
   sacrifice that could be offered to Almighty God; and this pattern hath
   been since not only closely followed, but out-done by the doctrines and
   practices of the church of Rome; as we have too much reason to remember
   upon this day. [3]

   But to proceed in the farther explication of the text, the meaning
   whereof, in short, is this: that the ritual and instrumental parts of
   religion, and all laws and duties concerning them, are of less value
   and esteem with God, than those which are of a moral nature, especially
   the great duties and offices of piety and humanity, of the love of God
   and of our neighbour. And, if we consider the matter well, we shall see
   the reason of it to be very plain; because natural and moral duties are
   approved of God, for themselves and for their own sake, upon account of
   their own natural and intrinsical goodness; but the ritual and
   instrumental parts of religion are only pleasing to God in order to
   these, and so far as they tend to beget and promote them in us; they
   are not naturally good in themselves, but are instituted and appointed
   by God for the sake of the other; and therefore great reason there is
   that they should be subordinate, and give way to them, when they come
   in competition with one another.

   For this is a known rule, which takes place in all laws, that laws of
   less importance should give way to those that are of greater; quoties
   leges ex circumstantia colliduntur, ita ut utraque servari non potest,
   servanda est lex potior: "Whenever two laws happen to be in such
   circumstances as to clash with one another, so that both of them cannot
   be observed, that law which is better and of greater consequence is to
   be kept." And Tully gives much the same rule in this matter: "In
   comparing of laws (says he) we are to consider which law is most useful
   and just, and reasonable to be observed." From whence it will follow,
   that when two laws, or more, or how many soever they be, cannot be
   observed, because they clash with one another; ea maxime conservanda
   putetur, quae ad maximas res pertinere videatur: "It is reasonable that
   that law should be observed, which is of greatest moment and
   concernment."

   By what hath been said, we may learn what is the meaning of this
   saying, which our Saviour more than once cites out of the prophet; "I
   will have mercy, and not sacrifice."

   From the words thus explained, I shall take occasion to prosecute the
   two propositions which I mentioned before; namely,

   First, That natural religion is the foundation of instituted and
   revealed religion.

   Secondly, That no instituted religion was ever designed to take away
   the obligation of natural duties; but is intended to establish and
   confirm them. And both these are sufficiently grounded in the reason of
   our Saviour's discourse from this rule, "I will have mercy, and not
   sacrifice."

   I. That natural religion is the foundation of instituted and revealed
   religion; and all revealed religion does suppose, and take for granted,
   the clear and undoubted principles and precepts of natural religion,
   and builds upon them. By natural religion, I mean obedience to the
   natural law, and the performance of such duties as natural light,
   without any express and supernatural revelation, doth dictate to men.
   These lie at the bottom of all religion, and are the great and
   fundamental duties which God requires of all mankind; as, that we
   should love God, and behave ourselves reverently towards him; that we
   should believe his revelations; and testify our dependance upon him, by
   imploring his aid and direction in all our necessities and distresses;
   and acknowledge our obligations to him for all the blessings and
   benefits which we receive; that we should moderate our appetites, in
   reference to the pleasures and enjoyments of this world, and use them
   temperately and chastely; that we should be just and upright in all our
   dealings with one another; true to our word, and faithful to our trust,
   and in all our words and actions observe that equity towards others,
   which we desire they should use towards us; that we should be kind and
   charitable, merciful and compassionate, one towards another; ready to
   do good to all, and apt not only to pity, but to relieve them in their
   misery and necessity. These, and such like, are those which we call
   moral duties; and they are of eternal and perpetual obligation, because
   they do naturally oblige, without any particular and express revelation
   from God. And these are the foundation of revealed and instituted
   religion, and all revealed religion does suppose them, and build upon
   them; for all revelation from God supposeth us to be men, and alters
   nothing of those duties to which we were naturally obliged before. And
   this will clearly appear if we consider these three things:

   1. That the Scripture every where speaks of these as the main and
   fundamental duties of the Jewish religion.

   2. That no instituted service of God, no positive part of religion, was
   ever acceptable to him, when these were neglected.

   3. That the great design of the Christian religion, was to restore and
   reinforce the practice of the natural law.

   1 . That the Scripture every where speaks of these as the main and
   fundamental duties of the Jewish religion. When our Saviour was asked,
   which was the first and great commandment of the law; he answered,
   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
   soul, and with all thy strength; and thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself." One would have expected he would have given quite another
   answer, and have pitched upon some of those things which were so much
   magnified among the Jews, and which they laid so much weight upon; that
   he should have instanced in sacrifice, or circumcision, or the law of
   the sabbath: but he overlooks all these as inconsiderable in
   comparison, and instances only in those two great heads of moral
   duty--the love of God and our neighbour; which are of natural and
   perpetual obligation, and comprehend under them all other moral duties.

   And these are those which our Saviour calls "the law and the prophets,"
   and which he says he came not "to destroy, but to fulfil." (Matt. v.
   17-20.) "Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I
   am not come to destroy, but to fulfil: for verily I say unto you, until
   heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from
   the law till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of
   these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called
   the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach
   them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I
   say unto you, that, except your righteousness shall exceed the
   righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
   into the kingdom of heaven."

   That our Saviour doth not here speak of the judicial or ceremonial law
   of the Jews, but of the duties of the moral law, will, I think, be very
   plain, from these following considerations:

   First, That the judicial or ceremonial laws of the Jews were to pass
   away, and did so, not long after; but this law which our Saviour speaks
   of, was to be perpetual, and immutable; for he tells us that heaven and
   earth should pass away, but one jot or one tittle of this law should
   not pass.

   Secondly, The observation of the law our Saviour speaks of, consisted
   in such things as the scribes and pharisees neglected; for he tells his
   disciples, upon this occasion, that except their righteousness did
   exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, they should "in
   no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." But now the scribes and
   pharisees were the most accurate and punctual people in the world, in
   observing the precepts of the judicial and ceremonial law; they were so
   far from taking away any thing from these observances, that they had
   added to them, and enlarged them, by in numerable traditions of their
   own; so exact were they, that they would "pay tithe of mint, and anise,
   and cummin," as our Saviour observes; but then they were extremely
   defective in moral duties: they were unnatural to their parents, and
   would pretend that their estates were consecrated to God; that, under
   this pretence of positive religion, they might excuse themselves from a
   natural duty, and let their parents starve for God's sake; they were
   covetous, and unjust, and devoured widows houses; in a word, our
   Saviour tells us, they neglected "the weightier matters of the law,
   mercy, judgment, and the love of God," and keeping faith with men: so
   that it is in these things, that our Saviour means, that our
   righteousness must" exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
   pharisees," viz. in the practice of moral duties, which were neglected
   by them; and, consequently, it is the moral law which our Saviour came
   to confirm and establish.

   Thirdly, If we consider the instances which our Saviour gives in his
   following discourse, by which we may best judge what he means. He
   instances in murder, and adultery, and perjury, which are undoubtedly
   forbidden by the natural law; and then he instances in several
   permissions which were indulged to them for the hardness of their
   hearts, but yet did intrench upon the dictates of right reason, and the
   first and original constitution of things; as the permission of divorce
   upon every slight occasion, and of revenge, and retaliation of
   injuries.

   Fourthly, If we consider that, by "the law and the prophets" our
   Saviour means that which was principally designed and ultimately
   intended by them; which was the observation of moral duties; which as
   they were written in the two tables by the immediate finger of God
   himself, so are chiefly inculcated by the prophets. And so we find this
   phrase of "the law and the prophets" elsewhere used by our Saviour,
   when he mentions that great rule of equity, that--we should do to
   others as we would have them do to us. (Matt. vii. 12.) "Therefore all
   things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
   them: for this is the law and the prophets." But how was this "the law
   and the prophets," when this rule was never so much as mentioned in
   either? our Saviour means, that this is the foundation of all those
   duties of justice and mercy, which are so much inculcated in "the law
   and the prophets."

   So that our Saviour makes the observation of moral duties to be the
   principal design of the Jewish law, and as it were the foundation of
   it; and therefore he calls moral duties, ta` Baru'era tou no'mou, "the
   weightier matters of the law." (Matt. xxiii. 23.) "But ye (says he to
   the scribes and pharisees) have neglected the weightier things of the
   law, judgment, and mercy, and fidelity." The scribes and pharisees
   busied themselves chiefly about ritual observances; but our Saviour
   tells them, that those other were the most considerable and important
   duties of the law, and lay at the bottom of the Jewish religion. And
   much the same enumeration the prophet makes, where he compares
   sacrifices and these moral duties together: (Mic. vi. 6, 7, 8.)
   "Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high
   God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a
   year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
   thou sands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my
   transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath
   shewed thee, Oman, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of
   thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
   God?" He had required sacrifices, but had no regard to them in
   comparison with these.

   2. No instituted service of God, no positive part of religion
   whatsoever, was ever acceptable to God, when moral duties were
   neglected; nay, so far from being acceptable to him, that he rejects
   them with disdain and abhorrence. To this purpose there are almost
   innumerable passages in the prophets, (Isa. i. 11, &c.) "To what
   purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? When ye come to
   appear before me, who hath required this at your hands, to tread my
   courts? Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me;
   the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away
   with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting; and when ye spread forth
   your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: when ye make many prayers,
   I will not hear." What is the reason of all this? because they were
   defective in the moral duties of religion; so it follows; "your hands
   are full of blood; wash ye, make ye clean; put away the evil of your
   doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek
   judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the
   widow; come now and let us reason together, saith the Lord;" implying
   that, till they had respect to moral duties, all their external worship
   and sacrifices signified nothing. And so likewise, (Isa. lxvi. 3.) he
   tells them that nothing could be more abominable than their sacrifices,
   so long as they allowed themselves in wicked practices; "he that
   killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if
   he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered
   swine's blood; and he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol;
   yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in
   their abominations." And to mention but one text more out of the Old
   Testament, (Jer. vii. 4, 5.) "Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The
   temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are
   these. Throughly amend your ways and doings, throughly execute judgment
   between a man and his neighbour; oppress not the stranger, the
   fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood." If they did
   not practise these duties, and forbear those sins, all the reverence
   for the temple and worship of God signifies nothing. You see, in the
   Jewish religion, what it was that was acceptable to God for itself and
   its own sake; viz. the practice of moral duties; and that all
   instituted religion, that did not promote and further these, or was
   destitute of them, was abominable to God. And under the gospel our
   Saviour prefers a moral duty before any gift we can offer to God, and
   will have it to take place, (Matt. v. 23, 24.) "If thou bring thy gift
   unto the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught
   against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way;
   first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."

   But it should seem by this, and what hath been said before, that God
   prefers goodness and righteousness to men, before his own worship: and
   obedience to the precepts of the second table, before obedience to
   those of the first.

   But this does but seem so; all that can be collected from this passage
   of our Saviour, or any thing that hath been already said, are only
   these two things.

   1. That God prefers the practice of the moral duties of the second
   table, before any instituted worship, such as sacrifice was; and before
   obedience to the laws of religion, which are merely positive, though
   they do immediately concern the worship of God.

   2. That if we neglect the duties of the second table, of goodness and
   righteousness towards men, God will not accept of our obedience to the
   precepts of the first, nor of any act of religious worship that we can
   perform. This our Saviour means when he says, "Leave there thy gift
   before the altar; first be reconciled to thy brother, then come and
   offer thy gift;" intimating that, so long as we bear a revengeful mind
   towards our brethren, God will not accept of any gift or sacrifice that
   we can offer to him; or, indeed, of any act of religious worship that
   we can perform.

   3. The great design of the Christian religion is to restore and
   reinforce the practice of the natural law, or, which is all one, of
   moral duties; and therefore our Saviour begins his first sermon, by
   promising blessedness to the practice of these duties; of purity, and
   meekness, and righteousness, and peaceableness, and mercifulness, and
   patience, and submission to the will of God, under persecutions and
   sufferings for righteousness sake; and tells us (as I shewed before)
   that he came not to release men from the practice of these duties, but
   to oblige them thereto more effectually; and that as these were "the
   law and the prophets," that is, the main duties and the foundation of
   the Jewish religion, so were they much more to be so of the Christian.
   This the Scriptures of the New Testament do every where declare to be
   the great design of the gospel, and the Christian religion, to instruct
   us in these duties, and to engage us effectually to the practice of
   them. In that known and excellent text, (Tit. ii. 11, 12.) "The grace
   of God (which is in and by the doctrine of the gospel) hath appeared to
   all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
   should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world." And
   herein St. James tells us, the true nature, and the force and virtue of
   the Christian religion doth consist: (James i. 27.) "Pure religion, and
   undefiled before God and the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless
   and the widows in their affliction, and to keep ourselves unspotted
   from the world." And, (chap. iii. 17.) "The wisdom which is from above
   (that is, that heavenly and Divine knowledge revealed to us by the
   gospel) hath these properties, and is apt to produce these effects; it
   is first pure, and then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated,
   full of mercy and of good fruits.

   And the planting of these dispositions in us is that which the
   Scripture calls the new creature, and the image of God. (Eph. iv. 20,
   &c.) The apostle, speaking there of the vices and lusts wherein the
   gentiles lived, tells Christians that they were otherwise instructed by
   the gospel: "But you have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have
   heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: that
   ye put off, concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is
   corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit
   of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is
   created in righteousness and true holiness;" or (as the words perhaps
   may be better rendered )in the holiness of truth; for it immediately
   follows: "Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
   neighbour."

   And this is that which the apostle elsewhere makes to be all in all in
   the Christian religion. "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth
   any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature." (Gal. vi. 15.)
   Which the apostle in the chapter before expresseth thus: "In Christ
   Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but
   faith which worketh (or is inspired) by charity." And yet more
   expressly: (1 Cor. vii. 19.) "Circumcision is nothing, and
   uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God."
   By the comparing of which texts, it appears that the main thing in
   Christianity is the practice of moral duties; and this is the new
   creature, and this the proper effect of the Christian faith, to produce
   these virtues in us. And, indeed, the great design of the Christian
   religion, and every thing in it, of the love of God in giving his Son
   to die for us, of the pardon of our sins and justification in his
   blood, of all the promises and threatenings of the gospel, and of the
   assistance therein promised, is to engage and encourage, and enable to
   the practice of moral duties.

   And thus I have done with the first thing I proposed to speak to;
   namely, that natural religion is the foundation of instituted and
   revealed religion; and all revealed religion does suppose it, and
   builds upon it. I proceed to the

   II. Second, namely, That no revealed and instituted religion was ever
   designed to take away the obligation of natural duties, but was
   intended to confirm and establish them. And this also will be evident,
   if we consider these three things:

   1. That all revealed religion calls men to the practice of natural
   duties. This the Jewish religion did. The first laws which God gave
   them, and which he distinguished from the rest, by writing them in
   tables of stone with his own finger, were the precepts of the moral
   law. And the great business of the prophets, whom God raised up among
   them, from time to time, was to reprove not so much their defects in
   their sacrifices, and in the duties of instituted worship, as the
   breach of the natural law by their vices and immoralities; and to
   threaten them with the judgments of God, if they did not reform and
   amend their faults.

   And now, under the gospel, the preceptive part of it is almost wholly
   made up of moral duties; namely, those which are comprehended under
   those two great commandments, of the love of God and our neighbour. In
   the Christian religion there is very little that is merely positive and
   instituted, besides the two sacraments, and praying to God in the name
   and mediation of Jesus Christ.

   2. The most perfect revelation that ever God made to mankind (I mean
   that of the Christian religion), doth furnish us with the best help and
   advantages for the performance of moral duties; it discovers our duty
   more clearly to us; it offers us the greatest assistance to enable us
   to the performance of it; it presents us with the most powerful motives
   and arguments to engage us thereto; so that this revelation of the
   gospel is so far from wakening the obligation of natural duties, that
   it confirms and strengthens it, and urgeth us more forcibly to the
   practice of them.

   3. The positive rites and institutions of revealed religion are so far
   from intrenching upon the laws of nature, that they were always
   designed to be subordinate and subservient to them; and, whenever they
   come in competition, it is the declared will of God, that positive
   institutions should give way to natural duties; and this I have shewn
   to be plainly the meaning of this saying in the text, "I will have
   mercy, and not sacrifice." If circumstances be such that one part of
   religion must give place, God will have the ritual and instituted part
   to give way to that which is natural and moral.

   It is very frequent in Scripture, when the duties of natural religion
   and rites of Divine institution come in competition, to slight and
   disparage these in comparison of moral duties, and to speak of them as
   things which God hath no pleasure in; and which, in comparison with the
   other, he will hardly own that he hath commanded. "When ye come to
   appear before me, who hath required this at your hands?" (Isa. i. 12.)
   "Thou desirest not sacrifice, thou delightest not in burnt-offerings."
   (Psal. li. 16.) "Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or
   ten thousands of rivers of oil? He hath shewed thee, O man, what is
   good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to
   love mercy?"

   But God no where makes any comparison to the disadvantage of natural
   duties; he never derogated from them in any case; he never said he
   would have such a thing, and not mercy; or that he had rather such a
   rite of religion should be performed, than that men should do the
   greatest good, and shew the greatest charity to one another. It is no
   where made a question, will the Lord be pleased that we deal justly
   every man with his neighbour, and speak the truth one to another? that
   we be kind and tender-hearted, and ready to forgive? that we be willing
   to distribute and give alms to those that are in need? There is no
   question as this put in Scripture; nay, it is positive in these
   matters, that "with such sacrifices God is well pleased." I instance in
   this virtue more especially of kindness and compassion, because it is
   one of the prime instances of moral duties; as sacrifice is put for all
   the ritual and instituted part of religion, and this disposition of
   mind our Saviour makes the root of all moral duties; "love is the
   fulfilling of the law:" and the apostle speaks of it as the great end
   and scope of the gospel; "the end of the commandment is charity." And
   this temper and disposition of mind he advanceth above knowledge, and
   faith, and hope; "the greatest of these is charity;" and without this
   he will not allow a man to be any thing in Christianity: this he makes
   our highest perfection and attainment, and that which abides and
   remains in the future state: "charity never fails."

   This our Saviour most effectually recommends to us, both in his
   doctrine and by his example; this he presseth as a peculiar law of his
   religion, and the proper mark and character of a disciple. This he
   requires us to exercise towards those who practise the contrary towards
   us; "to love our enemies, and to do good to them that hate us." And of
   this he hath given us the greatest example that ever was: "when we were
   enemies to him," he loved us so as hardly ever any man did his friend,
   so as "to lay down his life for us;" and he instituted the sacrament
   for a memorial of his love to mankind, and to put us in mind how we
   ought to love one another.

   And now the application of what hath been said upon this argument, to
   the occasion of this day, is very obvious; and there are two very
   natural inferences from it.

   First, From what hath been said upon this argument, it plainly appears
   what place natural and moral duties ought to have in the Christian
   religion: and, of all natural duties, mercy and goodness. This is so
   primary a duty of human nature, so great and considerable a part of
   religion, that all positive institutions must give way to it; and
   nothing of that kind can cancel the obligation of it, nor justify the
   violation of this great and natural law. Our blessed Saviour, in his
   religion, hath declared no thing to the prejudice of it; but, on the
   contrary, hath heightened our obligation to it as much as is possible,
   by telling us, that "the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives,
   but to save them."

   So that they know not what manner of spirit they are of who will kill
   men to do God service; and, to advance his cause and religion in the
   world, will break through all obligations of nature, and civil society,
   and disturb the peace of mankind.

   Nor did our Saviour, by any thing in his religion, design to release
   men from the obligation of natural and civil duties. He had (as one
   would imagine) as much power as the pope, but yet he deposed none of
   the princes of this world, nor did absolve their subjects from their
   fidelity and obedience to them, for their opposition to his religion:
   he assumed no such power to himself (no, not in ordine ad spiritualia),
   nor, that ever we read of, did he give it to any other. Whence, then,
   comes his pretended vicar to have this authority? And yet the horrid
   attempt of this day was first designed, and afterwards carried on, in
   prosecution of the pope's bull of excommunication; and was not so much
   the effect of the despair and discontent of that party, here in
   England, as the natural consequence of their doctrines of extirpating
   heretics and deposing kings, and absolving subjects from their
   allegiance to them.

   No zeal for any positive institution in religion can justify the
   violation of the natural law, the precepts whereof are of primary and
   indispensable obligation. The pope's supremacy is not so clear as the
   duty of obedience to civil government; nor is transubstantiation so
   plainly revealed in Scripture, as it is, both in nature and Scripture,
   that we should "do no murder." And yet how many thousands have been put
   to death, because they could not understand this hard word, and believe
   this impossible thing! And yet, if the supremacy of the pope were
   clearly of Divine right, and the doctrine of transubstantiation as
   plain as the institution of the sacrament, yet, these being but
   positive matters in religion, there would be no reason to kill men for
   not understanding and believing these things; nay, it would be contrary
   to religion to do it; because the law of mercy and humanity, which is
   the law of nature, ought not to be violated for the promoting of any
   positive institution; and God hath plainly said, that "he will have
   mercy rather than sacrifice;" yea, rather than the sacrifice of the
   mass, if it were, what they pretend it is, the offering of the natural
   body and blood of Christ; because it would be needless: for
   propitiation of sin being once made by Christ's offering himself once
   for all upon the cross, there needs no more sacrifice for sin. Nay, I
   will go further yet: I had rather never administer the sacrament, nor
   ever receive it, than take away any man's life about it; because the
   sacrament is but a positive rite and institution of the Christian
   religion, and God prefers mercy, which is a duty of natural religion,
   before any rite or institution whatsoever. Besides that, all acts of
   malice and cruelty are directly contrary to the particular nature and
   design of this blessed sacrament, which is to commemorate the
   sufferings of the Son of God for our sakes, and to give us an example
   of the greatest love that ever was, and thereby to excite us to the
   imitation of it.

   2. What hath been said, gives us a right notion and character of that
   church and religion, which prefers the positive rites and institutions
   of religion, and the observance of them, to those duties which are of
   natural and eternal obligation, mercy and goodness, fidelity and
   justice; and which, for the sake of a pretended article of religion, or
   rite of worship (which, if it were certain that they were revealed and
   instituted by God, are yet merely positive), will break the greatest of
   God's commandments, and teach men so.

   It is too plain to be denied, that the principles and precepts of
   natural religion were never so effectually undermined, and the morality
   of the Christian religion never so intolerably corrupted and debauched,
   by any thing that ever had the face of religion in the world, as by the
   allowed doctrines and practices of the church of Rome; and this out of
   a blind and furious zeal for some imaginary doctrines and rites of the
   Christian religion; which, at the hot, are of mere positive
   institution, and of the same rank among Christians, that sacrifices
   were in the Jewish religion. For which we need go no further for an
   instance, than in the occasion of this day's solemnity; upon which day
   (about fourscore years ago), there was designed a mighty sacrifice
   indeed, the greatest and richest burnt-offering that ever was pretended
   to be offered up to Almighty God, by those of any religion whatsoever;
   not the blood of bulls and goats, but of king, and princes, and nobles,
   more in value than "thousands of rams, and ten thousands of rivers of
   oil;" than "all the beasts of the forest, and the cattle upon a
   thousand hills."

   Here was a prodigious sacrifice indeed; but w here was mercy? the thing
   God chiefly desires, and which, above all other things, is acceptable
   to him: no mercy, not even to those of their own religion, whom these
   nice and tender casuists, after a solemn debate of the case, had
   resolved to involve in the same common destruction with the
   rest;--rather no mercy, than that this sacrifice, which their mad zeal
   had prompted them to, should be omitted.

   To conclude: they that can do such inhuman things, and think them to be
   religion, do not understand the nature of it, but had need to be taught
   the first rudiments of natural religion; that natural duties are not to
   be violated upon pretence; no, not for the sake of positive
   institutions; because natural religion is the foundation of that which
   is instituted; and, therefore, to violate any natural duty, for the
   sake of that which is instituted, is for religion to undermine and blow
   up itself! Let those who do such things, and teach men so, go and learn
   what that meaneth "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice."

SERMON CIII.

  CHRISTIANITY DOTH NOT DESTROY, BUT PERFECT, THE LAW OF MOSES.

   Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I am not
   come to destroy, but to fulfil.--Matt. v. 17.

   THERE is no saying in the whole gospel which the Jews did so frequently
   object to the Christians as this of our blessed Saviour, as if his
   words and actions were plainly repugnant and contrary to one another:
   for when it is evident, say they, that he took away so many ceremonies,
   purifications, distinctions of meats, sacrifices, judicial laws, and
   many other things; yet he says, he came not "to destroy the; law or the
   prophets;" so that it is plain that he did throw down the law of Moses,
   and in so doing contradicted his own saying, that he did not intend "to
   destroy the law. To clear our Saviour's words of this objection, it
   will be requisite to consider the scope and design of his discourse in
   this chapter, by which we shall fully understand the sense and meaning
   of these words in the text.

   Our Saviour, in this sermon (which contains the sum and substance of
   his religion) doth earnestly recommend to his disciples and followers,
   and strictly enjoins the perfect practice of, all goodness and virtue,
   declaring to them, that he came to bring in and establish that
   righteousness which the Jewish religion indeed aimed at, but, through
   the weakness and imperfection of that dispensation, was not able to
   effect and accomplish. And to take away all suspicion of a design to
   contradict the former revelations of God, made to the Jews by Moses and
   the prophets, or to destroy their Divine authority, by carrying on a
   design contrary to them; I say to prevent any imagination of this kind,
   he does here, in the text, expressly declare the contrary: "Think not,"
   &c. intimating that some either did, or at least might be apt to
   suspect, that his design was to destroy the obligation of the law, and
   to undermine the authority of Moses and the prophets: to free them from
   this jealousy, he declares plainly, that he had no such thought and
   intention--it was far from him.

   "I come not to destroy," katalusai, to abrogate, or dissolve the law,
   to encourage men to the breach and violation of it; for the word is of
   the same sense with luein, at the nineteenth verse. "Whoso ever shall
   break one of these least commandments;" and with katargesai, (Rom. iii.
   31.) ?nomon oun katargoumen; "Do we then make void the law by faith?"
   which is the same question with that of the same apostle, (Gal. iii.
   21.) "Is the law then against the promises of God?" that is, are the
   law and gospel contrary? do they contradict one another? So that the
   meaning of our Saviour's declaration is this: that he was not come to
   dissolve and abrogate and make void the law, or to encourage men to the
   breach of it; that the precepts of his religion were in no wise
   contrary to those of the law and the prophets, did not thwart and
   oppose them, or any ways contradict the main design and intention of
   the law and the prophets, that is, of the Jewish religion; for so "the
   law and the prophets" do frequently signify: (Matt, vii. 12.)
   "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
   ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets;" that is,
   this is the main scope and intention of what your religion, contained
   in "the law and the prophets," teacheth concerning your duty to one
   another. So, likewise, (Matt. xxii. 40.) "On these two commandments
   hang all the law and the prophets;" that is, this is the sum of all the
   duties of religion; to these two laws, all that the Jewish religion
   teacheth may be referred. "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil;" to
   carry on the same design which was intended by the Jewish religion, and
   to perfect and accomplish it; to supply all the defects and weaknesses
   and imperfections of that dispensation: this is the plain meaning of
   this caution and declaration of our Saviour's--"Think not, &c.

   For the clearing of this matter, viz. That the design of our Saviour's
   doctrine and religion is not contrary to those former revelations,
   which God made to the Jews by Moses and the prophets; this will
   evidently appear, whether we consider the prophecies and predictions of
   the Old Testament, or the laws and precepts therein contained.

   First, The prophecies and predictions of the Old Testament: our Saviour
   came not to contradict and overthrow these; but to fulfil them. The
   chief predictions of "the law and the prophets" were concerning the
   Messias and his spiritual kingdom. In the law it was foretold,
   that--God would raise to them a prophet like unto Moses, whom they
   ought to hear and obey; and to him all the prophets of the Old
   Testament gave witness--foretelling the time of his coming, his
   extraction, the manner and circumstances of his birth, the purity and
   efficacy of his doctrine, the actions and miracles of his life, his
   passion, death, and burial, with the particular circumstances of them,
   his resurrection from the dead, and his ascension into heaven, and
   exaltation at the right hand of God; so that this part of "the law and
   prophets" he did accomplish and fulfil in a most eminent and remarkable
   manner: all things that the prophets had foretold, concerning the
   Messias, were punctually made good in the person, and actions, and
   sufferings of our Saviour.

   Secondly, As to the laws and precepts of the Jewish religion, the
   doctrine and the laws of Christianity did not clash with them; nor
   properly abrogate them, and make them void, especially as to the moral
   precepts, which were the very life and spirit, the ultimate scope and
   design of that religion; nay, so far was it from doing so, that the
   main and proper intention of Christianity, was to clear and establish
   that which was the main design of "the law and prophets," to perfect
   the law in this part, and to raise and advance morality to its highest
   pitch, to supply all the defects and imperfections of the Jewish
   religion, and to make men much better than that weak and imperfect
   institution was able to do. This was the great design of Christianity;
   and it is very probable that our Saviour had a principal if not a sole
   respect to the precepts of the moral law, when he here says, that "he
   came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to perfect and fulfil
   them;" as I shall have occasion by and by to shew more at large.

   But that we may give a full answer to the objection of the Jews against
   this saying of our Saviour's, I shall shew that he did not come to
   thwart and contradict, and properly to abrogate and make void the
   Jewish law, in any part of it, neither the civil and judicial, nor the
   ritual and ceremonial, much less the moral and natural precepts of it.
   This is more than I think to be absolutely necessary, to reconcile this
   saying of our Saviour with the rest of his doctrine and actions; for
   though he had properly abrogated the ceremonial law, and in no sense
   fulfilled it; yet, notwithstanding this, it may be true, that "he came
   not to destroy the law and the prophets;" that is, to destroy the
   obligation of moral duties, which he speaks of in this chapter, and
   elsewhere declares to be the ultimate scope, the sum and substance of
   "the law and the prophets;" for if the ceremonial law was not designed
   by God to be perpetual, but to give way to a more perfect dispensation;
   then our Saviour did no way thwart and contradict "the law and the
   prophets;" by abrogating the ceremonial law, at that time, when God
   designed that a period should be put to it. But yet, for the fuller
   satisfaction to this objection, I shall shew that our Saviour did not
   properly abrogate any part of the Jewish law, no, not the ritual and
   ceremonial part of it; but did fulfil it.

   First, Not their civil and judicial laws. These, in the original
   intention of them, were not laws designed for mankind, but suited and
   fitted to the disposition and temper, the condition and circumstances,
   of a particular people and nation; to these our Saviour taught
   obedience, and paid it himself, and never did any thing contrary to
   them, nor in the least weaken the obligation of them; but they
   continued in full force, until that nation and commonwealth was
   dissolved. So that these laws were no way impeached or abrogated by the
   Christian religion; but they fell for want of a subject to exercise
   their power upon, and because the people that were to be governed by
   them were destroyed or dissipated; and though they neither are, nor
   ever were, obligatory to other nations, as given by Moses, and as they
   were the peculiar laws of a particular nation; yet the natural reason
   and equity of them, so far as it concerned mankind, is duly considered
   and regarded by us, and many of these laws are adopted into the laws of
   most Christian nations. It is plain, then, that this part of the Jewish
   law received no prejudice by Christianity, but continued in full force,
   so long as that nation and commonwealth lasted, which was to be
   governed by it.

   Secondly, As to the ritual and ceremonial part of the Jewish law, which
   consisted in circumcision, and purifications, and sacrifices, in
   distinction of meats, and times, and innumerable other rites and
   observances; this was not properly abrogated and made void by the
   coming of Christ, but fulfilled and made good by him. The rites and
   ceremonies of the law, were the types and shadows of those future good
   things which were promised under the gospel; a kind of rude draught of
   a better and more perfect institution, which was designed, and at last
   finished and perfected by the Christian religion. This account the
   apostle gives of the legal rites and observances: (Col. ii. 10, 17.)
   "Let no man judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a holy-day,
   or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of
   things to come, but the body is of Christ; "that is, he is the
   substance and reality of all those things, which were shadowed and
   figured by those legal observances. And so the apostle to the Hebrews
   calls the priests and sacrifices of the law, the "examples and shadows
   of heavenly things, (chap. viii. 5.) and (so chap. x. 1.) "the law
   having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the
   things; "that is, being but an obscure type, and not a perfect
   representation of the blessings and benefits of the gospel, which we
   now have in truth and reality. Now reason will tell us, that the laws
   concerning these types and shadows, were only to continue till the
   substance of the things signified by them should come, and that they
   would be of no longer use, when that more perfect institution, which
   was figured by them, should take place, and then they would expire, and
   become void of themselves; because the reason and use of them ceasing,
   they must necessarily fall.

   But they did not expire immediately upon the coming of Christ, and
   therefore he himself submitted to these laws, so long as they continued
   in force; he was circumcised, and presented in the temple, and
   performed all other rites required by the law; that first covenant to
   which these laws and ordinances belonged, continuing in force till the
   ratification of the second covenant by the death of Christ, and then
   these laws expired, or rather were fulfilled, and had their
   accomplishment in the sacrifice of Christ, which made all the
   sacrifices and other rites of the Jewish religion needless, and of no
   use for the future; Christ having, by this "one sacrifice of himself,
   perfected for ever them that are sanctified," as the same apostle
   speaks. (Heb. x. 14.) So that Christ did not properly abrogate and
   repeal those ritual and ceremonial laws; but they, having continued as
   long as they were designed to do, and there was any use of them, they
   abated and ceased of themselves.

   And that the death of Christ was the time of their expiration, because
   then the new covenant took place, St. Paul expressly tells us: (Eph.
   ii. 15.) "having abolished or voided in his flesh the law of
   commandments contained in ordinances;" and this, (ver. 16.) he is said
   to have done by his cross; and y more plainly, (Col. ii. 14.) "blotting
   out the handwriting of ordinances, which was against us, and took it
   out of the way, nailing it to his cross."

   So that ye see that even the ceremonial law was not so properly
   abrogated by the sacrifice and death of Christ, but rather had its
   accomplishment, and attained its end, in the sacrifice of Christ; which
   by the eternal efficacy of it to the expiation of sin, and the
   purifying of our consciences, hath made all the sacrifices and
   washings, and other rites of the ceremonial law, for ever needless and
   superfluous.

   Thirdly, But especially as to the moral law, and those precepts which
   are of natural and perpetual obligation, our Saviour did not come
   either to dissolve, or to lessen and slacken the obligation of them.

   And of this I told you our Saviour doth principally, if not solely,
   speak here in the text, as will appear to any one that shall
   attentively consider the scope of his discourse. In the beginning of
   his sermon he promiseth blessing to those, and those only, who were
   endowed with those virtues which are required by the precepts of the
   moral law, or comprehended in them; and then he tells them, that
   Christians must be very eminent and conspicuous for the practice of
   them: (ver. 16.) "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see
   your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven: "and then
   he cautions them not to entertain any such imaginations, as if he
   intended to dissolve the obligation of the law, and to free men from
   the practice of moral duties, which probably some might have suggested
   against him: "Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the
   prophets; 1 as if he had said--you cannot entertain any such conceit,
   if you consider that the precepts, of which I inculcate upon you, and
   those virtues, the practice whereof I recommend to you, are the same
   which are contained in the law and the prophets. So that I am so far
   from crossing the main design of the law and the prophets, and taking
   away the obligation of moral duties enjoined by the Jewish religion,
   that I come purposely to carry on the same design to further
   perfection, to give a more perfect and clear law, and to give a greater
   enforcement and encouragement to the practice of moral duties: these
   were always the sum and substance of religion, the ultimate design of
   the law and the prophets; and therefore I am so far from discharging
   men from the obligation of the moral precepts of the law, that I come
   to bind them more strongly upon you. And, "verily I say unto you," that
   is, I solemnly declare, "that whosoever shall break one of these least
   commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in
   the kingdom of heaven;" that is, he shall in no wise enter therein. You
   think the scribes and pharisees very pious and excellent men, and to
   have attained to a high pitch of righteousness; "but I say unto you,
   that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
   scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of
   heaven." And then he instanceth in several precepts of the moral law,
   which in the letter of them, especially as they were interpreted by the
   teachers of the law among the Jews, were very much short of that
   righteousness and perfection which he now requires of his disciples and
   followers. So that his whole discourse is about precepts and
   obligations of the moral law, and not a word concerning the ritual and
   ceremonial law; which makes me very prone to think, that our Saviour's
   meaning in the text is this, that his religion was so far from
   thwarting and op posing that which was the main design of "the law and
   the prophets," that is, of the Jewish religion, that the principal
   intention of Christianity was to advance the practice of goodness and
   virtue, by strengthening the obligation of moral duties, and giving us
   a more perfect law and rule of life, and offering better arguments and
   greater encouragements to the obedience of this law. Therefore, for the
   fuller explication and illustration of this matter, I shall endeavour
   to clear these three points:

   First, That the main and ultimate design of "the law and the prophets,"
   was to engage men to the practice of moral duties; that is, of real and
   substantial goodness.

   Secondly, That the law of Moses, or the dispensation of the Jewish
   religion, was comparatively very weak and insufficient to this purpose.

   Thirdly, That the Christian religion hath supplied all the defects, and
   weaknesses, and imperfections of that dispensation. These three
   particulars will fully clear our Saviour's meaning in this text.

   First, That the main and ultimate design of "the law and the prophets,"
   was to engage men to the practice of moral duties; that is, of real and
   substantial goodness, consisting in those virtues which our Saviour
   mentions at the beginning of this sermon; humility, and meekness, and
   mercy, and righteousness, and purity, and peaceableness. This our
   Saviour more than once tells us was the sum and substance, the main
   scope and design of the whole doctrine of "the law and the prophets:"
   (Matt. vii. 12.) "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men
   should do unto yon, do ye even so unto them; for this is the law and
   the prophets." (And Matt. xxii. 40.) That the love of God and our
   neighbour, those two great commands, to which all moral duties are
   reduced, are the two great hinges of the Jewish religion; on these two
   hang all "the law and the prophets." St. Paul calls love, "the
   fulfilling of the whole law;" (Rom. xiii. 10.) St. James, "the perfect
   and the royal law," as that which hath a sovereign influence upon all
   parts of religion. And therefore the apostle (Rom. iii. 21.) tells us,
   that this more perfect righteousness which was brought in by the
   gospel, or the Christian religion, is witnessed by "the law and the
   prophets." And, indeed, the prophets every where do slight and
   undervalue the ritual and ceremonial part of religion, in comparison of
   the practice of moral duties: (Isa. i. 11.) "To what purpose is the
   multitude of your sacrifices unto me? bring no more vain oblations;
   your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth." But what then
   are the things that are acceptable to God? He tells us at the 1 6th
   verse: "Wash ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from
   before mine eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment,
   relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow." And
   by the prophet Jeremiah, God tells that people, that the business of
   sacrifices was not the thing primarily designed by God, but obedience
   to the moral law; the ritual law came in upon occasion, for the
   prevention of idolatry, and by way of condescension to the temper of
   that people; and thus Maimonides and the learned Jews understood these
   words: (Jer. vii. 22, 23.) "I spake not unto your fathers, nor
   commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt,
   concerning burnt-offerings and sacrifices; but this thing commanded I
   them, saying, Obey my voice, and walk in all the ways that I have
   commanded, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people." So
   likewise, in the prophet Hosea, God plainly prefers the moral before
   the ritual part of religion, as that which was principally designed and
   intended by him: (Hos. vi. 6.) "I desired mercy and not sacrifice; and
   the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings; "but most plainly and
   expressly, (Mic. vi. 6.) "Wherewith shall I come before the Lord? Shall
   I come before him with burnt-offerings? will the Lord be pleased with
   thousands of rams, and ten thousand of rivers of oil? He hath shewed
   thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but
   to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
   "These, it seems, were the great things which God stood upon, and
   required of men even under that imperfect dispensation; and these are
   the very things which the Christian religion doth so strictly enjoin
   and command; so that this righteousness, which the gospel requires, was
   witnessed to by "the law and the prophets." I proceed to the

   Second point, That the law of Moses, or the dispensation of the Jewish
   religion, was comparatively very weak, and insufficient to make men
   truly good, and for the promoting of real and inward righteousness: it
   gave laws, indeed, to this purpose, but those not so clear and perfect,
   or at least not so clearly understood, as they are now under the
   gospel; and it made no express promises of inward grace and assistance,
   to quicken and strengthen us in the doing of our duty; it made no
   explicit promises of any blessing and reward to the doing of our duty
   beyond this life; so that the best and most powerful arguments and
   encouragements to obedience, were either wholly wanting, or very
   obscurely revealed under this dispensation.

   And this insufficiency of the Jewish dispensation, both to our
   justification and sanctification, to the reconciling of us to God, and
   the making of us really good, the apostle frequently inculcates in the
   New Testament: (St. Paul, Acts xiii. 38, 39.) "Be it known unto you,
   therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you
   the forgiveness of sins, and by him all that believe are justified from
   all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses;
   and, (Rom. viii. 3.) "What the law could not do, in that it was weak
   through the flesh;" that is, by reason of the carnality of that
   dispensation, consisting in the purification of the body: (Gal. iii.
   21.) he calls it a law unfit to give life: "If there had been a law
   which could have given life, verily righteousness had been by the law."
   And the apostle to the Hebrews, (chap. viii. 6, 7, 8, &c.) finds fault
   with the dispensation of the law, for the lowness and meanness of its
   promises, being only of temporal good things; and for want of
   conferring an inward and a powerful principle to enable men to
   obedience; "but now hath he obtained (speaking of Christ) a more
   excellent ministry, by how much, also, he is the mediator of a better
   covenant, which was established upon better promises; for if that first
   covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for
   a second;" and this second and better covenant, he tells us, was
   foretold by the prophets of the Old Testament; for, finding fault with
   them, he saith, "Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make
   a new covenant with the house of Israel, and the house of Judah; not
   according to the covenant which I made with their fathers. For this is
   the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those
   days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their minds, and write
   them in their hearts. And (chap. x. 1. 4.) he shews the inefficacy of
   their sacrifices for the real expiation of sin: "The law having but a
   shadow of good things to come, and not the lively representation of the
   things themselves, can never, with those sacrifices, which they offered
   year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect; for it is
   not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins."

   I should now have proceeded to the third particular; namely, that the
   Christian religion hath supplied all the defects, and weakness, and
   imperfection of the Jewish dispensation; but that I shall not now enter
   upon, but make one plain inference from the substance of what I have
   already discoursed upon this argument.

   If our Saviour came not to dissolve and loosen the obligation of moral
   duties, but to confirm and establish it, and to enforce and bind the
   practice of these duties more strongly upon us, then they do widely and
   wilfully mistake the design of Christianity, who teach that it
   dischargeth men from the obligation of the moral law, which is the
   fundamental and avowed principle of the antinomian doctrine, but
   directly contrary to this declaration of our Saviour in the text: "That
   he came not to destroy the law and the prophets," but to perfect and
   fulfil them; (for to take away the obligation of a law, is plainly to
   destroy and make it void;) and contrary to the apostle's solemn
   resolution of this matter: (Rom. iii. 31.) "Do we then make void the
   law through faith?" that is, does the gospel destroy and take away the
   obligation of the law? "God forbid; yea, we establish the law; the
   Christian religion is so far from designing or doing any such thing,
   that it gives new strength and force to it.

   But surely they that teach this doctrine, did never duly consider that
   terrible threatening of our Saviour, after the text, which seems to be
   so directly levelled at them: "Whosoever shall break one of these least
   commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in
   the kingdom of heaven;" for how can men more effectually teach the
   violation, not only of the least, but of the greatest of God's
   commandments, than by declaring that the gospel hath set men free from
   the obligation of the moral law? which is, in effect, to say, that
   Christians may act contrary to all the duties of morality; that is, do
   the most impious things in the world without any offence against God;
   and, not withstanding this, continue to be his children, and highly in
   the favour of God.

   And all the security they have against this impious consequence is,
   that weak and slender pretence, that gratitude and love to God will
   preserve them from making this ill use of the grace of the gospel, and
   oblige them to abstain from sin, and to endeavour to please God as much
   as any law could do. But then they do not consider the nonsense of
   this: for there can be no such thing as sin, if the obligation of the
   law be taken away; for "where there is no law there can be no
   transgression," as the apostle, and common reason likewise, tell us; so
   that the law being removed and taken away, all actions become
   indifferent, and one thing is not more a sin, or offence against God,
   than another. And what, then, is it they mean, that gratitude will
   oblige men to, or preserve them from? when there can be no such thing
   as sin or duty, as pleasing or offending God, if there be no law to
   oblige us to the one, or restrain us from the other.

   And what is, if this be not, "to turn the grace of God into
   wantonness," and to make Christian liberty a cloak for all sorts of
   sins? A man cannot do a greater despite to the Christian religion, nor
   take a more effectual course to bring it into contempt, and to make it
   to be hissed out of the world, than to represent it as a lewd and
   licentious doctrine, which gives men a perfect discharge from all the
   duties of morality, and obligeth them only to believe confidently, that
   Christ hath purchased for them a liberty to do what they will; and
   that, upon these terms, and no other, they are secured of the favour of
   God in this world, and eternal salvation in the other. This is the sum,
   and the plain result, of the antinomian doctrine, the most pernicious
   heresy, and most directly destructive of the great end and design of
   Christianity, that ever yet was broached in the world. "But ye have not
   so learned Christ," if so be ye have heard him, and have been taught by
   him, "as the truth is in Jesus; that ye put off, concerning your former
   conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful
   lusts; and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on
   the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
   holiness."

SERMON CIV.

  CHRISTIANITY DOTH NOT DESTROY, BUT PERFECT THE LAW OF MOSES.

   Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I am not
   come to destroy, but to fulfil.--Matt. v. 17.

   I HAVE considered this saying of our Saviour's with respect to the
   moral law, and those precepts which are of natural and perpetual force,
   and that our Saviour did not come either to dissolve or loosen the
   obligation of them; for the illustration of which, I propounded to
   clear these three points:

   First, That the main and ultimate design of "the law and the prophets,"
   was to engage men to the practice of royal duties; that is, of real and
   substantial goodness.

   Secondly, That the law of Moses, or the dispensation of the Jewish
   religion, was comparatively very weak and insufficient to make men
   truly good, and ineffectual to promote and reward real righteousness.
   These two points I have spoken to. I shall now proceed to the

   Third, namely, That the Christian religion doth supply all the defects,
   and weaknesses, and imperfections of the Jewish dispensation.

   The Jewish religion had very considerable advantages above the mere
   light of nature, which was all that the heathen world had to conduct
   them to wards eternal happiness; the Jews had the knowledge of the one
   true God, and very signal and particular testimonies of the Divine
   Providence, which did naturally tend to beget in them good hopes of a
   future life, and the rewards of another world; they had the natural law
   revealed, and the main precepts of it written with God's own hand, and
   by Moses delivered to them; by which means they had a more certain and
   distinct knowledge of their duty: they had prophets frequently sent to
   them, to admonish them of their duty, and to exhort them to repentance,
   and to warn them of approaching judgments. They had good encouragement
   given to hope for the pardon of sin, by God's appointment of several
   ways^of expiation; which, how unlikely soever they were to be available
   to the effectual expiation of sin, yet they did signify, that the
   Divine nature was placable, and did seem to figure some more effectual
   way, designed by God for that purpose, that should be exhibited in due
   time. And, finally, they had most express promises and threatenings of
   temporal blessings and judgments, to en courage them in their
   obedience, and to deter them from the transgression of God's laws.
   These advantages the Jews plainly had above the rest of the world; God
   did not deal so with other nations, neither had the heathen such a
   knowledge of God's laws.

   But notwithstanding this, the Jewish religion was very short and
   defective, very weak and ineffectual to the great end of righteousness
   and true holiness, and to raise men to that perfection of goodness, of
   which human nature, through the grace of God, is capable; and therefore
   there wanted a more perfect institution, to supply the defects, and
   weakness, and imperfection even of that Divine revelation which God had
   made to the Jews, and really to effect and accomplish that which the
   Jewish religion attempted and aimed at, and was but, as I may say,
   rudely begun, under that imperfect institution. And this the gospel, or
   the Christian religion revealed by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
   hath fully effected, as will evidently appear by a particular survey
   and consideration of the main defects of the Jewish religion, which I
   shall shew to be all perfectly made up by the revelation of the gospel,
   and the doctrine of Christianity, in these following particulars.

   First, It was a great defect of the Jewish religion, that a
   considerable part of it was merely external, concerning the
   purification of the body and the flesh, and only figurative of that
   inward purity and real righteousness, which renders men truly good, and
   like to God; for which reason the Jewish institution is by the apostle
   to the Hebrews called the law of a carnal commandment: (Heb. vii. 16;
   and chap. ix. 10.) is said to consist only (that is chiefly) "in meats
   and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances imposed on them
   until the time of reformation;" that is, till the Messias should come
   and give such laws as should really tend to reform the hearts and lives
   of men; and therefore these laws and ordinances are called poor pitiful
   elements, and the rudiments of the world, fitted rather for children in
   understanding and goodness, than to bring men to any maturity and
   perfection in goodness. All their rites of purification did only
   sanctify to the purifying of the flesh; but did not purge the
   conscience from dead works, as the apostle to the Hebrews speaks,
   (chap. ix. 13, 14.) "they could not make those that performed and
   observed them perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;" (ver. 9.) that
   is, these laws had no effect upon the minds of men, to make them really
   better, to cure them of their moral defects and impurities, their sins
   and vices.

   But the Christian institution doth perfectly supply this defect, by
   taking us off from those carnal and external observances, and
   principally requiring that we "worship God in spirit and in truth;" by
   giving us such laws as wholly tend to advance real and substantial
   goodness, purity and holiness of heart and life, such as mainly tend to
   reform the minds and manners of men, and to make us like to that holy
   and perfect Being whom we worship: and besides an external, humble, and
   reverent demeanour of ourselves in the worship of God, (to which
   natural religion doth likewise direct,) Christianity hath only
   instituted two solemn external rites; viz. baptism, and the Lord's
   supper; whereby we solemnly oblige ourselves to the practice of all
   virtue and goodness; I say only these two, that, by the multitude of
   external observances, Christians might not be taken off from the
   minding of the real and substantial duties of religion.

   And therefore the church of Rome have extremely abated and weakened the
   force of Christianity upon the hearts and lives of men, by amusing them
   with external rites, which they have multiplied to that excessive
   degree, as to make the yoke of Christ really heavier than that of
   Moses, and the Christian religion a more external and carnal
   commandment than that of the law; and by this means have diverted and
   taken off the minds of men from the main design of Christianity,
   insomuch that they are so employed and taken up with matters of
   external ceremony, that they have no leisure to think of being good
   men, and to mind the great and substantial duties and virtues of the
   Christian life; so that they have spoiled the Christian religion of one
   of its chief excellences and perfections, I mean the simplicity of its
   worship, which they have now en cumbered with so many foolish and
   frivolous rites and observances, as do not only render it more
   burthensome, but less apt to make men inwardly and substantially good,
   than even Judaism itself. This is so true and so visible, that the
   wiser and better sort of them have complained of it for several ages,
   and still do, as much as they dare for fear of the inquisition, or some
   other censure.

   Secondly, Another defect of the law of Moses was, that it did not give
   encouragement enough to repentance, by declaring and assuring to us any
   certain way and method for the expiation and forgiveness of sin. This
   the rites of all religions aimed at, and pretended to; but were very
   ineffectual to that end. The heathen sacrifices, and all the cruel and
   barbarous rites belonging to them, did all pretend to be so many ways
   of appeasing the offended Deity, and of making atonement and expiation
   for sin: and the sacrifices of the Jews were instituted by God himself,
   to make an external and legal expiation, and to be the types and
   shadows of a better and more perfect sacrifice, which should really
   expiate sin: but even this was very darkly and imperfectly discovered
   to them; besides that, the expiations of the law did only extend to the
   least sort of sins, those of ignorance and inadvertency, but not at all
   to presumptuous sins, and such as were committed with n high hand, nor
   to wilful and deliberate sins, except in some very few and rare cases
   particularly mentioned in the law; so that though a great part of the
   religious rites, both of the pagan and Jewish religion, aimed at the
   expiation of sin, yet were they really ineffectual to that end; and,
   upon the whole matter, mankind, though they conceived good hope of
   God's mercy and forgiveness in case of repentance, ("Who can tell if
   God will turn and repent, and turn away from his anger?") yet they were
   unacquainted with any certain and effectual means to that purpose.

   It remains, then, that this great blessing of the forgiveness of sins,
   was never sufficiently declared and assured to mankind, but through
   Jesus Christ in the gospel. So St. Paul expressly asserts: (Acts xiii.
   38, 39.) "Be it known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that
   through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins, and by
   him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could
   not be justified by the law of Moses." The gospel hath provided an
   expiation for all sins in general, and that by a sacrifice of
   inestimable value,--the blood of the Son of God. And this is a mighty
   encouragement to repentance, and one most effectual means to reclaim
   men from their sins, to be assured that they are indemnified for what
   is past. And this the apostle means when he says, (Gal. iii. 13.) that
   "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse
   for us;" that is, whereas the law left sinners, as to those sins which
   stood most in need of pardon, under a curse, having provided no
   expiation for them, Christ hath redeemed them from that curse by making
   a general expiation for sin; and in this sense it is that the author to
   the Hebrews says, (chap. ix. 15.) that Christ died for the redemption
   of the transgressions that were under the first covenant; that is, for
   those sins for which the covenant of the law had provided no way of
   forgiveness; and therefore St. John says emphatically, (1 John i. 7.)
   that "the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin."

   Thirdly, The law did not afford sufficiently plain and certain rules
   and directions for a good life. As the corruption and degeneracy of
   mankind grew worse, so the light of nature waxed dimmer and dimmer, and
   the rule of good and evil was more doubtful and uncertain, and that in
   very consider able instances of our duty. The law of Moses was peculiar
   to the Jews: and even to them, who only had the benefit and advantage
   of it, it did not give clear and perfect light and direction as to
   moral duties, and those things which are of an eternal and immutable
   reason and goodness. And therefore our Saviour in this sermon explains
   it to a greater perfection than it was understood to have among the
   Jews, or the letter of it seemed to intend, and hath not only forbidden
   several things permitted by that law, as divorce and retaliation of
   injuries; but hath heightened our duty in several instances of it,
   requiring us to love our enemies, and to forgive the greatest injuries
   and provocations, though never so often repeated, and not only not to
   revenge them, but to requite them with good turns; which were not
   understood by mankind to be laws before; but yet, when duly considered,
   are very agreeable to right reason, and the sense of the wisest and
   best men. So that the Christian religion hath not only fixed and
   determined our duty, and brought it to a greater certainty, but hath
   raised it to a greater perfection, and rendered it every way fit to
   bring the minds of men to a more Divine temper, and a more reasonable
   and perfect way of serving God, than ever the world was instructed in
   before.

   Fourthly, The promises and threatenings of the law were only of
   temporal good and evil things, which are, in comparison of the endless
   rewards and punishments of another world, but very languid and faint
   motives to obedience. Not but that the Jews under the law had such
   apprehensions of their own immortality, and of a future state of
   happiness and misery after this life, as natural light suggested to
   them; which was in most but a wavering and uncertain persuasion, and
   consequently of small efficacy to engage men to their duty; but the law
   of Moses added little or nothing to the clearness of those natural
   notions concerning a future state, and the strengthening of this
   persuasion in the minds of men; it did rather suppose it, than give any
   new force and life to it. And for this reason more particularly the
   apostle tells us, that the law was but weak to make men good; because
   it did not work strongly enough upon the hopes and fears of men by the
   weight of its promises, and the terror of its threatenings; and that
   for this weakness and imperfection of it, it was removed, and a more
   powerful and awakening dispensation brought in the place of it: (Heb.
   vii. 18, 19.) "For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment
   that was before (that is, of the Jewish law) for the weakness and
   unprofitableness thereof; for the law made nothing perfect, but the
   bringing in of a better hope did;" that is, the covenant of the gospel,
   which promiseth eternal life. And, (chap. viii. 6.) for this reason,
   more especially, the apostle says, that Christ had "obtained a more
   excellent ministry, being the Mediator of a better covenant, which was
   established upon better promises." And (Rom. i. 16, 18.) St. Paul tells
   us, that for this reason "the gospel is the power of God unto
   salvation," because "therein the wrath of God is revealed from heaven,
   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men." The clear
   revelation of a future judgment, was that which made the gospel so
   proper and so powerful an instrument for the salvation of men. The
   great impiety of mankind, and their impenitency in it, was not so much
   to be wondered at before, while the world was, in a great measure,
   ignorant of the infinite danger of a wicked life; and therefore God is
   said, in some sort, to overlook it; "but now he commands all men every
   where to repent, because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge
   the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof
   he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from
   the dead." (Acts xvii. 30, 31.) The clear discovery and perfect
   assurance of a future judgment, calls loudly upon all men to leave
   their sins and turn to God.

   Fifthly, The covenant of the law had no spiritual promises contained in
   it of the grace and assistance of God's Holy Spirit for the mortifying
   of sin, and enabling men to their duty, and supporting them under
   sufferings; but the gospel is full of clear and express promises to
   this purpose. Our Saviour hath assured us, that "God will give his Holy
   Spirit to them that ask him," (Luke xi. 13.) and this the apostle tells
   us is actually conferred upon all true Christians, those who do
   sincerely embrace and believe the gospel: (Rom. viii. 9.) "If any man
   have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his." Hence the gospel is
   called, by the same apostle, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
   Jesus:" (ver. 2, of that chap.) "The law of the Spirit of life in
   Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death;" and in
   the next words he tells us, that herein manifestly appeared the
   weakness of the law, that it left men destitute of this mighty help and
   advantage (at least to any special promise of it): "What the law could
   not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son
   in the likeness of sinful flesh, and, by making him a sacrifice for
   sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law
   might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the
   Spirit;" that is, that that righteousness which the law aimed at and
   signified, but was too weak to effect, might be really accomplished in
   us, "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit;" that is, who
   are acted and assisted by a higher and better principle than men either
   have in nature, or the carnal dispensation of the law did endow men
   withal. And because of this great defect the law is said to be a state
   of bondage and servitude; and, on the contrary, the gospel, by reason
   of this mighty advantage, is called a state of adoption and liberty:
   (ver. 15.) "For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage, but the
   Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father;" and (2 Cor. iii. 17.)
   "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." And to this very
   thing St. Paul appeals, as that whereby men might judge whether the law
   or the gospel were the more excellent and powerful dispensation: (Gal.
   iii. 2.) "This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the
   works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?" As if he had said let
   this one thing determine that whole matter; were ye made partakers of
   this great privilege and blessing of the Spirit, while ye were of the
   Jewish religion, or since ye became Christians? And (ver. 14.) he calls
   it "the blessing of Abraham;" that is, the blessing promised to all
   nations by Abraham's seed, namely, the Messias; "that the blessing of
   Abraham might come on the gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might
   receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."

   And then, for the supporting us under afflictions, the gospel promiseth
   an extraordinary assistance of God's Holy Spirit to us: (1 Pet. iv.
   14.) "If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the
   Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you."

   But were there no good men under the dispensation of the law? Yes,
   certainly there were, and they were so by the grace and assistance of
   God's Holy Spirit; but then this was an effect of the Divine goodness,
   but not of any special promise, contained in that covenant, of Divine
   grace and assistance to be conferred on all those that were admitted
   into it. But thus it is in the new covenant of the gospel, and
   therefore the law is called "a dead letter," "the oldness of the
   letter," and "the ministration of the letter;" in opposition to the
   gospel, which is called the "ministration of the Spirit." And this the
   apostle lays special weight upon, as a main difference between these
   two covenants, that the first gave an external law, but the new
   covenant offers inward grace and assistance to enable men to obedience,
   and hath an inward and powerful efficacy upon the minds of men,
   accompanying the ministration of it: (Heb. viii. 7-10.) "For if that
   first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been
   sought for the second. For finding fault with them he saith, Behold the
   days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the
   house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, not according to the
   covenant which I made with their fathers, &c. For this is the covenant
   which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the
   Lord; I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in their
   hearts."

   And of this inward grace and assistance we are further secured, by the
   powerful and prevalent and perpetual intercession of our High Priest
   for sinners at the right hand of God; not like the inter cession of the
   priests under the law, who, being sinners themselves, were less fit to
   intercede for others; but "we have an High Priest that is holy, harm
   less, undefiled, and separate from sinners; who, by the eternal Spirit
   offered himself without spot to God," to purchase for us those
   blessings which he intercedes for. The priests under the law were
   intercessors upon earth; but "Christ is entered into heaven itself, now
   to appear in the presence of God for us." (Heb. ix. 24.) The priests
   under the law were removed from this office by death; but Christ,
   because he continues for ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood, and is
   an everlasting advocate and intercessor for us, in the virtue of his
   most meritorious sacrifice continually presented to his Father, where
   he is always at the right hand of God, to present our prayers to him,
   and to obtain pardon of our sins, and grace to help in time of need,
   and by his intercession in heaven, to procure all those blessings to be
   actually conferred upon us, which he purchased for us by his blood upon
   earth; "wherefore he is able to save to the utmost all those that come
   to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them," as
   the same apostle speaks, Heb. vii. 25.

   And thus I have, as briefly as well I could, shewed how the Christian
   religion doth supply all the weaknesses and imperfections of the Jewish
   religion; and, consequently, does in no wise contradict or interfere
   with the great design of the law and the prophets, but hath perfected
   and made up whatever was weak or wanting in that institution, to make
   men truly good; or, as the expression is in the prophet Daniel, "to
   bring in everlasting righteousness;" that is, to clear and confirm
   those laws of holiness and righteousness, which are of indispensable
   and eternal obligation.

   And if this be the great design of our Saviour's coming, and the
   Christian doctrine be every way fitted to advance righteousness and
   true holiness, and to make us as excellently good as this imperfect
   state of mortality will admit, since it hath many advantages
   incomparably beyond any religion or institution that ever was in the
   world, both in respect of the perfection of its laws, and the force of
   its motives and arguments to repentance and a holy life, and in respect
   of the encouragements which it gives, and the examples which it sets
   before us, and the powerful assistance which it offers to us, to en
   able us "to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,
   and to perfect holiness in the fear of God;" what a shame is this to
   us, who are under the power of this excellent institution, if the
   temper of our minds, and the tenor of our conversation, be not in some
   measure answerable to the gospel of Christ! The greater helps and
   advantages we have of being good, the greater things may justly be
   expected from us; for "to whomsoever much is given, of him much shall
   be required."

   Christianity is the fulfilling of the righteousness of the law, by
   walking not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, by mortifying the
   deeds of the flesh, and by bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit,
   which are "love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
   fidelity, meekness, and temperance." The righteousness of faith doth
   not consist in a barren and effectual life of the gospel, in a mere
   embracing of the promises of it, and relying upon Christ for salvation;
   in "a faith without works," which is dead; but in "a faith which
   worketh by love," in becoming "new creatures, "and in "keeping the
   commandments of God, the righteousness of faith speaking on this wise."
   "This is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son
   Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment;" (1 John
   iii. 23.) and "this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth
   God, love his brother also," (1 John iv. 21.) "That we approve the
   things that are excellent, being filled -with the fruits of
   righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of
   God," (Phil. i. 10, 11.) "Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
   are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
   whatsoever things are lovely, what soever things are of good report, if
   there be any virtue, if there be any praise, mind these things," (chap.
   iv. 8.)

   And then, considering what abundant provision the gospel hath made for
   our attainment of everlasting salvation, we are altogether without
   excuse, if we perish. Since God hath raised up so mighty a salvation
   for us; how shall we escape? If we die in our sins, it is not because
   God would not forgive them, but because we would not repent and be
   saved; the fault is all our own, and we owe it wholly to ourselves, if
   we be lost and undone for ever. If when life and death, heaven and
   hell, are so plainly set before us, eternal misery and perdition fall
   to our lot and portion, it is not because we were not warned of our
   danger, or because happiness and the things of our peace were hid from
   our eyes, but because we have made death and destruction our obstinate
   and final choice.

   "But, beloved, I hope better things of you, and things which accompany
   salvation, though I thus speak. Only let your conversation be as
   becometh the gospel of Christ;" and if we be careful to perform the
   conditions which the gospel requires on our part, we shall not fail to
   be made "partakers of that eternal life, which God, that cannot lie,
   hath promised to us, for his mercy's sake in Jesus Christ."

SERMON CV.

  OF THE NATURE OF REGENERATION, AND ITS NECESSITY, IN ORDER TO JUSTIFICATION
  AND SALVATION.

   For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature.--Galat. vi. 15.

   THERE are two Epistles of St. Paul, namely, that to the Romans, and
   this to the Galatians, which are principally and particularly designed
   to confute a false persuasion, which had prevailed amongst many
   Christians, especially those who were converted from Judaism--that it
   was not enough for men to embrace and confess the Christian religion,
   unless they kept the law of Moses, or at least submitted to that great
   precept of circumcision; the neglect whereof, among all the affirmative
   precepts of the law, was only threatened with excision, or being cut
   off from among the people. And of the prevalency of this error, and the
   great disturbance which it made in the Christian church, we have a
   particular account, Acts xv. where a general council of the apostles is
   called, and a letter written, in their names, to all the Christian
   churches, to rectify their apprehensions in this matter (ver. 24. of
   that chapter): "Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out
   from us, have troubled you with words, subverting your souls saying, Ye
   must be circumcised, and keep the law; to whom we gave no such
   commandment," &c.

   And upon this occasion likewise it was, that St. Paul wrote this
   Epistle to the Galatians, as likewise that to the Romans; in the former
   of which, after he had at large confuted this error, (which he calls
   the preaching of another gospel, than what the apostles had preached,
   and the Christians first received;) in the beginning of the fifth
   chapter he exhorts them to assert the liberty, which Christ had
   purchased for them, from the obligation of the law of Moses: (ver. 1,
   2.) "Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made
   us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Behold, I
   Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you
   nothing;" not that hereby he condemneth circumcision, as a thing evil
   in itself; for God never instituted or commanded any thing that was so;
   but he opposeth the opinion of the necessity of it to our justification
   and salvation, when the gospel had so plainly taken away the obligation
   and use of it; and consequently to affirm still the necessity of it,
   was really to renounce Christianity. For if Judaism was still the way
   to salvation, Christianity was to no purpose; and if Christianity be
   now the way, then the obligation to the Jewish religion was ceased. To
   avoid the force of this reasoning, it was not enough for the false
   apostles to say (as it seems they did) that Christians were not obliged
   universally to the whole law of Moses, but principally to the law of
   circumcision; because circumcision being the sign and badge of that
   covenant, whoever took that upon him, did thereby own his obligation to
   the whole law: (ver. 3, 4.) "For I testify again to every man that is
   circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law: Christ is become
   of no effect to you, whosoever of you are justified by the law, ye are
   fallen from grace;" that is, whoever of you expect and profess to be
   justified by the law of Moses, ye take away the necessity and use of
   the Christian religion; and are fallen from grace; that is, do in
   effect renounce the gospel; for "we, through the Spirit, wait for the
   hope of righteousness by faith," (ver. 5.) we by the Spirit, in
   opposition to circumcision, which was in the flesh, do expect to be
   justified by the belief of the gospel. "For in Jesus Christ neither
   circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision;" (ver. 6.) that
   is, now under the dispensation of the gospel by Christ Jesus, it
   signifies nothing to a man's justification or salvation, whether he be
   circumcised, or not circumcised, whether he be a Jew or a gentile. All
   that the gospel requires as necessary to these purposes, is, that we
   perform the conditions of the gospel, that so we may be capable of
   being made partakers of the blessings of it.

   Now as the great blessing and benefit of the gospel is variously
   expressed, as, by the forgiveness of our sins, by our acceptance with
   God, or (which comprehends both) by our justification, sometimes by
   adoption, and our being made the sons and children of God, sometimes by
   redemption, and (which is the consummation of all) by salvation and
   eternal life: I say, as the blessing and benefit of the gospel is, in
   Scripture, expressed to us by these several terms, which do in effect
   all signify the same thing; so our duty, and the condition the gospel
   requires on our part, is likewise as variously expressed; sometimes,
   and that very frequently, by the word faith, as being the great source
   and principle of all religious acts and performances; but then this
   faith must not be a bare assent and persuasion of the truth of the
   gospel, but such an effectual belief as expresseth itself in suitable
   acts of obedience and holiness, such as the apostle here calls pistis
   di' agapes energoumene, "a faith which worketh by love," a faith that
   is inspired and acted, or rather consummate and made perfect by charity
   (for so the word doth often signify), and then this phrase will be just
   of the same importance with that of St. James: (chap. ii. 22.) "By
   works is faith made perfect." Sometimes, and that also very frequently,
   the condition of the gospel is expressed by words which signify the
   change of our state, as by repentance, conversion, regeneration,
   renovation, sanctification, the new creature, and the new man, which
   expressions are all so well known, that I need not refer to particular
   texts; sometimes the condition of the gospel is expressed by the
   visible and sensible effects of this inward change in our outward life
   and actions; as, namely, by obedience and keeping the commandments of
   God. So (Heb. v. 9.) Christ is said to be "the author of eternal
   salvation to them that obey him;" where obedience is plainly put for
   the whole condition of the gospel, the performance whereof entitles us
   to eternal life and happiness.

   Now that by these various expressions, one and the same thing is
   certainly intended and meant, viz. the condition of the gospel; that
   which is required on our part, in order to our full and perfect
   justification and acceptance with God, is evident beyond all denial; by
   comparing the three different ways whereby St. Paul doth express the
   same proposition for sense and substance; in which he tells us what it
   is that will avail to our justification under the gospel; that is,
   according to the terms of the Christian religion; that is, neither here
   nor there, that it signifies nothing whether a man be circumcised or
   not, but that we be so qualified as the gospel requires, that the
   conditions upon which the blessings of the gospel are promised be found
   in us. And there are three texts wherein the same thing is plainly
   intended in three very different expressions. (Gal. v. 6.) "In Jesus
   Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but
   faith, which is consummate, or made perfect by charity." (Gal. vi. 15.)
   "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision: but a new creature." (1 Cor. vii. 19.) "Circumcision is
   nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: but the keeping of the
   commandments of God." It is evident, that in these three texts the
   apostle designs to say the same thing; and consequently, that faith
   which is made perfect by charity, and the new creature, and keeping of
   the commandments of God, are the same in sense and substance, viz. the
   condition of our justification and acceptance with God under the
   covenant of the gospel, or in the Christian religion.

   I shall at present, by God's assistance, handle the second of these
   texts. "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision: but a new creature." And here the condition of the
   gospel is expressed to us, by the change of our state, which in
   Scripture is called our regeneration, or becoming new creatures, and
   new men. Circumcision was but an outward sign and mark upon the body,
   and the flesh, though it did indeed prefigure and typify the inward
   circumcision of the heart, the giving of men new hearts, and new
   spirits, under the more perfect dispensation of the gospel: but now in
   Jesus Christ, that is in the Christian religion, the presence or the
   want of this outward mark will avail nothing to our justification: but
   that which was signified by it, the renovation of our hearts and
   spirits, our becoming new creatures, is now the condition of our
   justification and acceptance with God.

   The false apostles, indeed, did lay great stress upon the business of
   circumcision, not so much out of zeal to the law of Moses, as to avoid
   persecution: (ver. 12.) "They constrain you to be circumcised, only
   lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ." For, at
   that time, though the Christians were persecuted, yet the Jews by the
   Roman edicts had the free exercise of their religion, and therefore
   they gloried in this external mark of circumcision, because it exempted
   them from suffering; but St. Paul gloried in his sufferings for Christ,
   and the marks of that upon his body, (ver. 14.) "God forbid that I
   should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ;" and (ver.
   17.) "I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus." He tells them,
   what necessities soever they might pretend of circumcision, either for
   their justification or salvation, the true ground of all was to save
   themselves from temporal sufferings; and that in the Christian religion
   it signifieth nothing to recommend them to the favour of God, whether
   they were circumcised or not; nothing would be available to this
   purpose, but the renovation and change of their hearts and lives. "For
   in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision; but a new creature,; kaine` kti'sis, a new creation, to
   intimate the greatness of the change, which Christianity, thoroughly
   entertained, made in men.

   Having thus cleared the occasion and meaning of these words, I come now
   to consider the particulars contained in them; namely, these two
   things.

   First, That the gospel had taken away the obligation of the law of
   Moses. "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision."

   Secondly, That, according to the terms of the Christian religion,
   nothing will avail to our justification and acceptance with God, but
   the real renovation of our hearts and lives; "neither circumcision nor
   uncircumcision: but a new creature."

   I. That the gospel hath taken away the obligation of the law of Moses.
   In Christ Jesus, that is, now under the dispensation of the gospel,
   "neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision." There was
   never any general obligation upon mankind to this rite of circumcision,
   but only upon the seed of Abraham; but yet upon the preaching of the
   gospel, many of the Jewish Christians would have brought the gentiles
   under this yoke; pretending that Christianity was but a superstructure
   upon the law of Moses, which, together with the gospel, was to be the
   religion of the whole world; and there was some colour for this,
   because our Saviour himself submitted to this rite, and was
   circumcised; which the apostle takes notice of in the 4th chap, of this
   Epistle, (ver. 4.) "When the fulness of time was come, God sent forth
   his Son, made of a woman, made under the law;" that is, circumcised.
   And it is true, indeed, that our blessed Saviour was circumcised; but.
   not to signify to us the perpetuity of circumcision, and the
   continuance of it under the Christian religion, but for a quite
   different end; as a testimony of his obedience to that law, which,
   though afterwards it was to expire, yet was to be obeyed whilst it was
   in force, by all that were born under it; he was "made under the law,"
   and it be came him, who came to teach mankind obedience to the laws of
   God, "to fulfil all righteousness" himself: and therefore the apostle,
   in this .Epistle, where he takes notice of this, that Christ was "made
   under the law," gives this reason of it, that he might be the fitter to
   free those who were under it from the servitude of it; he was "made
   under the law, that he might redeem them that were under the law;" and
   that those who were in the condition of servants before, might be set
   at liberty, and "receive the adoption of sons."

   But how did his being "made under the law," qualify him "to redeem
   those who were under the law?" Thus--by submitting to it himself, he
   shewed that he owned the authority of it, and that he had no malice nor
   enmity against it; or, as he himself expresses it, that he "came not to
   destroy the law, but to fulfil it." And being fulfilled, and having
   served the time and end for which God intended it, it expired of
   itself; like a law which is not made for perpetuity, but limited to a
   certain period. And our blessed Saviour, who came with greater
   authority than Moses, and gave greater testimony of his Divine
   authority, had sufficient power to declare the expiration of it; and by
   commissioning his disciples, before and after his death, to preach the
   gospel to the whole world, he put an end to that particular law and
   dispensation, which only concerned the Jewish nation, by giving a
   general law to all mankind.

   So that from the death of our Saviour, and his ascension into heaven,
   upon which followed the general publication of the gospel, the law of
   Moses ceased; and, according to our Saviour's express appointment,
   proselytes were to be admitted into the Christian church only by
   baptism, and not by circumcision. And if circumcision, which was the
   sign of that covenant, was laid aside, then the whole obligation of
   that law and covenant which God had made with the Jews was also ceased.
   It was once, indeed, the mark of God's chosen and peculiar people; but
   now that God hath revealed himself to the whole world by his Son, and
   offers salvation to all mankind, gentiles as well as Jews, "the wall of
   separation is broken down," and circumcision, which was the mark of
   distinction between Jews and gentiles, is taken away; and therefore, he
   is said to have "made peace by his cross," and to have "blotted out and
   taken away the hand-writing of ordinances, nailing it to his cross;"
   that is, from the time of his death, to have taken away the obligation
   of the law of Moses, though it was a good while after, before the Jews
   were wholly weaned from the veneration and use of it.

   Nay, it was some time before the apostles were clearly convinced that
   the gospel was to be preached to the gentiles; this being one of those
   truths, which our Saviour promised after his departure, his Spirit
   should lead them into the perfect knowledge of; and then they were
   fully instructed, that the law of Moses was expired, and that it was no
   longer necessary to the salvation of men, that they should be
   circumcised and keep that law. And though it was once enjoined by God
   himself to the Jews, and their obedience to it was necessary to their
   acceptance with God; yet now, by Christ Jesus, God hath offered
   salvation to men upon other terms; and whether they were circumcised or
   not, was of no moment to their justification or salvation one way or
   other; but provided they performed the condition of this new covenant
   of the gospel, they were all alike capable of the Divine favour and
   acceptance.

   But I proceed to that which I mainly intend to prosecute from these
   words; and that is the

   II. Second particular in the text; namely, that according to the terms
   of the gospel, and the Christian religion, nothing will avail to our
   justification and acceptance with God, but the real renovation of our
   hearts and lives; "neither circumcision nor uncircumcision: but a new
   creature." For the full explication of this, I shall do these three
   things.

   First, Shew what is implied in this phrase of "a new creature."

   Secondly, That this is the great condition of our justification and
   acceptance with God, and that it is the same in substance with "faith
   perfected by charity," and with "keeping the commandments of God."

   Thirdly, That it is very reasonable it should be so.

   1. What is implied in this phrase of "a new creature." It is plain, at
   first sight, that it is a metaphorical expression of that great and
   thorough change which is made in men by the gospel, or the Christian
   religion. The Scripture sets forth to us this change by a great variety
   of expressions; by conversion, and turning from our iniquities unto
   God; by repentance (h signifies a change of our mind and resolution,
   and is in Scripture called repentance from dead works, and repentance
   unto life); by regeneration, or being born again; by resurrection from
   the dead, and rising to newness of life; by sanctification, and being
   washed and cleansed from all filthiness and impurity; which three last
   metaphors are implied in baptism, which is called regeneration. (Tit.
   iii. 5.) "According to his mercy he saved us by the washing of
   regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;" and our being "born
   again of water and the Holy Ghost;" (John iii. 3.) "Except a man be
   born again," &c. and (ver. 5.) "Except a man be born of water and of
   the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;" and "the
   purifying of our consciences;" (Heb. x. 22.) "Having our hearts
   sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure
   water;" and "the answer of a good conscience towards God;" (1 Pet. iii.
   21.) "Baptism doth now save us; not the putting away of the filth of
   the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God;" and
   finally, our being "baptized into the death and resurrection of
   Christ;" (Rom. vi. 3, 4.) "Know ye not that so many of us as were
   baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? therefore we
   are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was
   raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
   should walk in newness of life." And lastly, this change is set forth
   to us by renovation, and our being made new creatures and new men; (2
   Cor. v. 17.) "Therefore, if any man be in Christ/ that is, professeth
   himself a Christian, "he is a new creature; old things are passed away,
   behold all things are become new." And so likewise, (Ephes. iv. 22, 23,
   24.) this great change is expressed by "putting off, concerning the
   former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the
   lusts of deceit; and being renewed in the spirit of our minds, and
   putting on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and
   true holiness." The expression is very emphatical, "renewed in the
   spirit of our minds;" that is, in our very minds and spirits, to
   signify to us that it is a most inward and thorough change, reaching to
   the very centre of our souls and spirits. And Coloss. iii. 9, 10, 11.
   it is represented much after the same manner; "Seeing ye have put off
   the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man, which is
   renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him, where
   there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,
   barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Christ is all and in all."
   Which is the same with what the apostle says here in the text, that "in
   Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature;" that is, these external marks and
   differences signify nothing: but this inward change, "the new
   creature--Christ formed in us;" this in the Christian religion is all
   in all.

   But that we may the more clearly understand the just importance of this
   metaphor of "a new creature," or a new creation, I shall,

   First, Consider what it doth certainly signify, by comparing this
   metaphorical phrase with other plain texts of Scripture.

   And, secondly, That it doth not import what some would extend it to, so
   as to found doctrines of great consequence upon the single, strength of
   this, and the like metaphors in Scripture, without any manner of
   countenance from plain texts.

   First, I shall consider what this metaphor doth certainly import, so as
   to be undeniably evident from other more clear and full texts of
   Scripture; namely, these two things:

   1. The greatness of this change.

   2. That it is effected and wrought by a Divine power:

   1. The greatness of this change; it is called kaine' kti'sis, a new
   creation; as if the Christian doctrine, firmly entertained and
   believed, did, as it were, mould and fashion men over again,
   transforming them into a quite other sort of persons, than what they
   were before, and made such a change in them, as the creating power of
   God did, in bringing this beautiful and orderly frame of things out of
   their dark and rude chaos. Thus the apostle represents it: (2 Cor. iv.
   6.) "God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness (alluding to
   the first creation), hath shined into our hearts, to give the light of
   the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." We are
   translated from one extreme to another; (Acts xxvi. 18.) when our Lord
   sends Paul to preach the gospel to the gentiles, he tells him what a
   change it would make in them, by "opening their eyes, and turning them
   from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God." And St.
   Peter expresses the change which Christianity makes in men, by their
   being "called out of darkness into a marvellous light; (1 Pet. ii. 9.)
   And so St. Paul, (Eph. v. 8.) "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are
   ye light in the Lord."

   And, indeed, wherever the doctrine of Christ hath its full effect, and
   perfect work, it makes a mighty change both in their inward principles
   and outward practice; it darts a new light into their minds, so that
   they see things otherwise than they did before, and forms a different
   judgment of things from what they did before; it endues them with a new
   principle, and new resolutions, gives them another spirit, and another
   temper, a quite different sense and gust of things from what they
   formerly had. And this inward change of their minds necessarily
   produceth a proportionable change in their lives and conversations, so
   that the man steers quite another course, acts after another rate, and
   drives on quite other designs from what he did before.

   And this is remarkably seen in those who are reclaimed from impiety and
   profaneness to religion, and from a vicious to a virtuous course of
   life. The change is great and real in all; but not so sensible and
   visible in some, as others; in those who are made good by the
   insensible steps of a pious and virtuous education; as in those who are
   translated out of a quite contrary state, and "turned from the power of
   Satan unto God," and "translated out of the kingdom of darkness, into
   the kingdom of Christ;" which was the case of the heathen world, in
   their first conversion to Christianity.

   2. This change is effected and wrought by a Divine power, of the same
   kind with that which created the world, and raised up Christ Jesus from
   the dead; two great and glorious instances of the Divine power; and to
   these the Scripture frequently alludes, when it speaks of this new
   creation. "God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
   shined into our hearts. Like as Christ was raised from the dead by the
   glory of the Father, so we also are raised to newness of life," saith
   St. Paul. (Rom. vi. 4.) And to the same purpose the same apostle
   speaks, (Ephes. i. 19, 20.) "And that ye may know what is the exceeding
   greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the
   operation of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he
   raised him from the dead." So that our renovation, and being made new
   creatures, is an instance of the same glorious power, which exerted
   itself in the first creation of things, and in the resurrection of our
   Lord Jesus Christ from the dead; but not altogether after the same
   manner, as I shall shew under the next head.

   I should now, in the second place, proceed to shew, that this metaphor
   of a new creation doth not import what some men would extend it to, so
   as to found doctrines of great consequence upon the single strength of
   this and other like metaphors of Scripture, without any manner of
   countenance and confirmation from plain texts. But this I reserve to
   another discourse.

SERMON CVI.

  OF THE NATURE OF REGENERATION, AND ITS NECESSITY, IN ORDER TO JUSTIFICATION
  AND SALVATION.

   For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature.--Galat. vi. 15.

   IN these words are contained these two things:--

   First, That the gospel hath taken away the obligation of the law,
   having taken away the sign of that covenant, which was circumcision.

   Secondly, That, according to the terms of the gospel, and the Christian
   religion, nothing will avail to our justification and acceptance with
   God, but the real renovation of our hearts and lives. For the full
   explication of this, I propounded to do these three things:

   I. To shew what is implied in this phrase of "a new creature."

   II. That this is the great condition of our justification and
   acceptance with God, and that it is the same in sense and substance
   with those other expressions, in the two parallel texts, of "faith
   perfected by charity," and "keeping the commandments of God."

   III. That it is very reasonable that this should be the condition of
   our justification, and acceptance to the favour of God.

   I began with the first of these; viz. To shew what is implied in this
   phrase of "a new creature;" as to which I shewed,

   First, What this metaphor doth certainly import, so as to be undeniably
   evident from other more clear and full texts of Scripture; namely, the
   greatness of this change, and that it is effected by a Divine power. I
   now proceed,

   Secondly, To shew, that it doth not import what some would extend it
   to, and that so as to found doctrines of great consequence upon the
   mere and single strength of this and other like metaphors of Scripture,
   without any manner of countenance and confirmation from plain texts:
   such doctrines as these three.

   1. That as the creation was by an irresistible act of the Divine power,
   so is this new creation, or conversion of a sinner.

   2. That as creatures were merely passive in their being made, and
   contributed nothing at all to it, no more do we to our conversion and
   regeneration.

   3. That as the creation of the several ranks and kinds of creatures was
   in an instant, and effected by the powerful word of God, only saying,
   let such and such things be, and immediately they were; so this new
   creation, or the work of regeneration, is in an instant, and admits of
   no degrees.

   Concerning these three doctrines, of great moment and consequence in
   divinity, I shall shew, with all the clearness and brevity I can, that
   they are built solely upon metaphors of Scripture, tortured and
   strained too far, without any real ground or foundation from Scripture
   or reason; nay, contrary to the tenor of the one and the dictates of
   the other; nay, indeed, contrary to the general experience of the
   operation of God's grace upon the minds of men in their conversion.

   First, It is pretended, that as the creation was by an irresistible act
   of the Divine power, so is the new creation, or the conversion of a
   sinner; and this is solely argued from the metaphorical expressions of
   Scripture concerning conversion; such as being "called out of darkness
   into light," alluding to that powerful word of God, which in the first
   creation "commanded the light to shine out of darkness; being
   quickened, and raised to a new life;" and from this metaphor here in
   the text of a new creation.

   But surely it is a dangerous thing in divinity, to build doctrines upon
   metaphors, especially if we strain them to all the similitudes which a
   quick and lively imagination can find out; whereas some one obvious
   thing is commonly intended in the metaphor, and the meaning is absolved
   and acquitted in that, and it is folly to pursue it into all those
   similitudes which a good fancy may suggest. When our Saviour says, that
   "he will come as a thief in the night," it is plain what he means; that
   the day of judgment will surprise the careless world, when they least
   look for it, that "he will come at an hour when they are not aware;"
   and though ho resemble his coming to that of "a thief in the night,"
   yet here is nothing of robbery in the case. So here, when the change
   which Christianity makes in men is called a new creation, this only
   imports the greatness of the change, which by the power of God's grace
   is made upon the hearts and lives of men; and the metaphor is
   sufficiently absolved in this plain sense and meaning of it, agreeable
   to the literal expressions of Scripture concerning this thing; and
   there is no need that this change should in all other respects answer
   the work of creation; and consequently, there is no necessity that it
   should be effected in an irresistible manner, or that we should he
   altogether passive in this change, and that we should no ways concur to
   it by any act of our own, or that this work should be done in an
   instant, and admit of no steps and degrees.

   It is not necessary that this change should be effected in an
   irresistible manner. God may do so, when he pleaseth, without any
   injury to his creatures; for it is certainly no wrong to any man to be
   made good and happy against his will; and I do not deny, but that God
   sometimes does so. The call of the disciples to follow Christ, seems to
   have been a very sudden and forcible impression upon their minds,
   without any appearing reason for it; for it is not reasonable for any
   man to leave his calling, and follow every one that bids him do so. The
   conversion of Saul, from a persecutor of Christianity to a zealous
   preacher of it, was certainly effected, if not in an irresistible, yet
   in a very forcible and violent manner. The conversion of three thousand
   at one sermon, when the Holy Ghost descended in a visible manner upon
   the apostles, was certainly the effect of a mighty and overpowering
   degree of God's grace. And the like may be said of the sudden
   conversion of so many persons from heathenism, and great wickedness and
   impiety of life, to the sincere profession of Christianity, by the
   preaching of the apostles afterwards.

   But that this is not of absolute necessity, nor the ordinary method of
   God's grace, to work upon the minds of men in so overpowering, much
   less in an irresistible manner, is as plain as any thing of that nature
   can be, both from experience, and the reason of the thing, and the
   constant tenor of the Scripture. We find that many (perhaps the
   greatest part) of those that are good are made so by the insensible
   steps and degrees of a religious education, and having been never
   vicious, can give no great account of any sensible change, only that,
   when they came to years of understanding, they considered things more;
   and the principles that were instilled into them in their younger years
   did put forth themselves more vigorously at that time, as seeds sprout
   out of the ground after they have a good while been buried and laid hid
   in the earth.

   And it is contrary to reason, to make an irresistible act of Divine
   power necessary to our repentance and conversion; because this
   necessarily involves in it two things which seem very unreasonable.

   First, That no man repents upon consideration and choice, but upon mere
   force and violent necessity, which quite takes away the virtue of
   repentance, whatever virtue there may be in the consequent acts of a
   regenerate state.

   Secondly, It implies that the conversion and repentance of those upon
   whom God doth not work irresistibly is impossible, which is the utmost
   can be said to excuse the impenitency of men, by taking it off from
   their own choice, and laying it upon the impossibility of the thing,
   and an utter disability in them to choose and do otherwise.

   And it is, likewise, contrary to the constant tenor of the Bible, which
   supposeth that men do very frequently resist the grace and Holy Spirit
   of God. It is said of the pharisees, by our Saviour, (Luke vii. 30.)
   that "they rejected the counsel of God against themselves;" that is,
   the merciful design of God for their salvation. And of the Jews, (Acts
   vii. 51.) that "they always resisted the Holy Ghost. So that some
   operations of God's grace and Holy Spirit are resistible, and such as,
   if men did not resist them, would be effectual to bring them to faith
   and repentance, else why are the pharisees said to reject "the counsel
   of God against themselves," that is, to their own ruin? implying, that
   if they had not rejected it, they might have been saved; and if they
   had, it had been without irresistible grace; for that which was offered
   to them, was actually resisted by them. Other texts plainly shew, that
   the reason of men's impenitency and unbelief is not any thing wanting
   on God's part, but on theirs; as those known texts, wherein our Saviour
   laments the case of Jerusalem, because they obstinately brought
   destruction upon themselves: (Luke xix. 42.) "Jf thou hadst known in
   this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace:" intimating, that
   they might have known them, so as to have prevented that desolation
   which was coming upon them, and was a forerunner of their eternal ruin:
   "but now they are hid from thine eyes;" intimating, that then God gave
   them up to their own blindness and obstinacy; but the time was, when
   they might have "known the things of their peace;" which cannot be upon
   the supposition of the necessity of an irresistible act of God's grace
   to their conversion and repentance; because then without that they
   could not have repented, and if that had been afforded to them, they
   had infallibly repented. So likewise, in that other text, (Matt. xxiii.
   37.) "Oh! Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee,
   even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and you would
   not." And, in John, v. 40. "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have
   life." He "would have gathered them," and they "would not;" he would
   have given them life, but they would not come to him. Are these serious
   and compassionate expostulations and declarations of our Saviour's
   gracious intention towards them, any ways consistent with an
   impossibility of their repentance? which yet must be said, if
   irresistible grace be necessary thereto; for then repentance is
   impossible without it, and that it was not afforded to them is plain,
   because they did not repent. The same may be said of that solemn
   declaration of God, (Ezek. xxxiii. 11.) "As I live, saith the Lord God,
   I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn
   from his way and live." Can it be said that God hath no pleasure in the
   death of sinners, and yet be true, that he denies, to the greatest part
   of them, that grace which is necessary to their repentance? Upon this
   supposition, how can it be true, that, "if the mighty works that were
   done in Chorazin and Bethsaida had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they
   would have repented," (Matt. xi. 21.) since irresistible grace did not
   accompany those miracles? for if it had, Chorazin and Bethsaida had
   repented, and without it Tyre and Sidon could not repent.

   The same difficulty is in those texts, wherein God is represented as
   expecting the repentance and conversion of sinners; and our Saviour
   wondering at their unbelief and hardness of heart, and upbraiding them
   with it, (Isa. v. 4.) "What could I have done more to my vineyard, that
   I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring
   forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes! Mark vi. 6, it is said, our
   Saviour marvelled at the unbelief of the Jews; and, (chap. xvi. 14.)
   that he "upbraided his disciples with their unbelief and hardness of
   heart." But why should the repentance of sinners be expected, or their
   unbelief marvelled at, or indeed be upbraided to them, by him who knew
   it impossible to them, without an irresistible power and grace, which
   he knew likewise was not afforded to them? neither God nor man have
   reason to wonder that any man does not do that, which, at the same
   time, they certainly know he cannot do.

   The bottom of all that is said to avoid this pressing difficulty is
   this,--that this impotence and disability of sinners is their sin, and
   therefore cannot be pleaded in their excuse, for their impenitency; but
   God may still justly require that of them which they had once a natural
   power to do, but wilfully forfeited and lost it; they had this power in
   Adam, and forfeited it by his disobedience.--To shew how slight this
   evasion is, I need not run into that argument, how far we are guilty of
   the sin of our first parents. That by that first transgression and
   disobedience all mankind suffers, and our natures are extremely
   corrupted and depraved, cannot be denied; but the corruption of our
   natures is a thing very different from personal guilt, strictly and
   properly so called. I will take the business much shorter; and granting
   that mankind had in Adam a natural power to have continued obedient to
   the laws of God, yet, since "by one man sin entered into the world,"
   and "all are now sinners," here is an obligation to repentance as well
   as to obedience, and men shall be condemned for their impenitency. I
   ask now, whether in Adam we had a power to repent? It is certain Adam
   had not this power, and therefore I cannot see how we could lose it,
   and forfeit it in him. Adam, indeed, had a natural power not to have
   sinned, and so not to have needed repentance; but no power to repent in
   the state of innocency; because, in that state, repentance was
   impossible, because there could be no occasion for it. He had it not
   after his fall, because by that he forfeited all his power to that
   which is spiritually good. It is said, indeed, he had it in innocency,
   but forfeited it by his fall; so that he had it when there was no
   occasion or possibility for the exercise of it, and lost it when there
   was occasion for it: or if he did not lose it by his fall, we have it
   still, and then there is no need of any supernatural, much less
   irresistible, grace to repentance; so that our impotency, as to the
   particular duty of repentance, can not be charged upon us as our fault,
   not so much as upon the account of original sin.

   But the want of this power is the consequent and just punishment of our
   first transgression. Be it so; but if this impotency still remain in
   all those to whom God doth not afford his irresistible grace, how comes
   the grace offered in the gospel to aggravate the impenitency of men,
   and increase their condemnation? for if it be no remedy against this
   impotency, how comes it to inflame the guilt of impenitency? or how is
   it grace to offer mercy to those upon their repentance, who are out of
   a possibility of repenting; and yet, to punish them more severely for
   their impenitency after this offer made to them, which they cannot
   accept without that grace which God is resolved not to afford them? If
   this be the case, the greatest favour had been to have had no such
   offer made to them; and it had been happier for mankind, that the grace
   of God had not appeared to all men, but only to those who shall
   irresistibly be made partakers of the benefit of it.

   Secondly, Another doctrine grounded upon this metaphor of a new
   creation, is, that we are merely passive in the work of conversion and
   regeneration, and contribute nothing to it; that God does all, and we
   do nothing at all; and this follows from the former, especially if we
   allow the metaphor as far as it will carry us. For as the first
   creation of things was by an irresistible act of the Divine power, so
   the things that were made were only passive in their creation; and, as
   they could make no resistance, so neither could they contribute any
   thing to their being what they are. And this doctrine is not only
   argued from the metaphor of a new creation, but from several other
   metaphors used in Scripture, to describe our natural state; as, namely,
   darkness, blindness, and our being dead in trespasses and sins; from
   whence it is inferred, that we contribute no more to our renovation,
   than darkness doth to the introduction of light, than a blind man can
   do to the recovery of his sight, or a dead man to his own resurrection;
   but are wholly passive in this work. And to countenance this notion,
   they make great advantage of the character which is given in Scripture
   of the most degenerate heathen, taking it for granted, that their
   condition is the true standard of a natural and unregenerate state; and
   to this purpose they insist particularly upon that description of the
   gentile idolaters, (Eph. iv. 18, 19.) "Having the understanding
   darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance
   that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts; who being
   past feeling, had given themselves over to lasciviousness; to work all
   uncleanness with greediness." Which is, indeed, a description of men in
   their natural state, but not of all; but of such as by the worst sort
   of vicious practices of the grossest idolatry, and most abominable
   lewdness, were degenerated to the utmost, so that their condition
   seemed desperate, without a miraculous and extraordinary grace of God,
   which was probably afforded to many of these. In like manner they argue
   the common condition of mankind, from the description which is given of
   the wickedness of men, before God brought the flood upon them: (Gen.
   vi. 5.) "God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
   that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually." This they make the character of all men, in their natural
   state, whereas this is a description of an extraordinary degeneracy of
   men, signifying that the world was then extremely bad, and depraved to
   the highest degree; for God gives this as a reason why he was resolved
   to drown the world, and "to destroy man from the face of the earth,"
   because "their wickedness was grown to so great a height." But if this
   were a description of the natural state of mankind, this could be no
   particular reason for bringing a flood upon the world at that time,
   there being the same reason for it, for fifteen hundred years before,
   and ever will be the same reason to the end of the world; that is, that
   men are naturally corrupted and depraved. Surely they consider the
   Scripture very superficially, that interpret it at this rate!

   It is true, that the nature of man is sadly corrupted and depraved; but
   not so bad as, by vicious practices and habits, it may be made; all men
   are not equally at the same distance from the grace of God; some are
   nearer to the kingdom of God than others, and less force and violence
   will serve to rescue them from the power of Satan, and to transplant
   them into the kingdom of Christ. The prevalency and dominion of sin
   makes an unregenerate state, as the prevalency of grace puts a man into
   a regenerate state. An unregenerate man is not necessarily as bad as is
   possible, no more than it is necessary to a regenerate state, that a
   man be perfectly good; so that it is a great mistake to argue the
   common condition of all mankind, from the descriptions that are given
   in the Scripture of the worst of men; and therefore, if it were granted
   that irresistible grace were necessary for the conversion of such, it
   will not follow that the same is necessary to all.

   All unregenerate men are not equally devoid of a sense of God, and
   spiritual things; they have many convictions of what they ought to be
   and do, and under those convictions are very capable of persuasion,
   which dead men are not. The grace of God is necessary to the conversion
   of a sinner; but it is not necessary that he should be only passive in
   this work. Experience tells us the contrary, that we can do something,
   that we can co operate with the grace of God; and the Scripture tells
   us the same, and makes it an argument and encouragement to us "to work
   out our own salvation, because God works in us both to will and to do
   of his own goodness;" (Phil. ii. 12, 13.) Besides that, it is the
   greatest and justest discouragement in the world, to all endeavours of
   repentance and reformation, to tell men that they can do nothing in it.
   He that is sure of this, that he can do nothing in this work, is a fool
   if he make any attempt to be come better, because he struggles with an
   impossibility; and if the work will be done at all, it will be done
   without him, and he neither can nor ought to have any hand in it. But
   will any metaphor bear men out against so palpable an absurdity as
   this?

   And yet, after all, there is no force in these metaphors, to prove what
   they aim at by them. For if to be dead in sin signifies an utter
   impotency to goodness, then to be dead to sin must, on the contrary,
   signify an impossibility of sinning; for just as the unregenerate man
   is dead in sin, so he that is regenerate is said in Scripture to be
   dead to sin: but yet the best of regenerate men, notwithstanding they
   are dead to sin, and alive to God, do offend in many things, and too
   frequently fall into sin. Why then should the metaphor be so strong on
   the one side, that a man, who is said to be dead in sin, should not be
   able so much as to co-operate with the grace of God in the work of
   repentance and conversion?

   In short, if this be true, that men in an unregenerate and unconverted
   state are perfectly dead, and have no more sense of spiritual things
   than a dead man hath of natural objects, then all precepts and
   exhortations to repentance, and all promises and threatenings to argue
   and persuade men thereto are vain, and to no purpose; and it would be
   every whit as proper and reasonable for us to preach in the churchyard,
   over the graves of dead men, as in the church to the unregenerate;
   because they can no more act and move towards their own recovery, out
   of a state of sin and death, than the dead bodies can rise out of their
   graves.

   But it is said, that the end of exhortations and promises is not to
   declare to men their power, but their duty. But if they be insensible,
   it is to as little purpose to declare to them their duty, as their
   power. Besides, it will be a hard thing to convince men that any thing
   is their duty, which at the same time we declare to them to be out of
   their power.

   But this is Pelagianism, to say that of ourselves we can repent and
   turn to God. And who says we can of ourselves do this, besides the
   Pelagians? we affirm the necessity of God's grace hereto, and withal
   the necessity of our co-operating with the grace of God. We say that
   without the powerful excitation and aid of God's grace, no man can
   repent and turn to God; but we say likewise, that God can not be
   properly said to aid and assist those who do nothing themselves.

   But men can do more than they do, and therefore are justly condemned:
   not in the work of conversion sure; if they can do nothing at all. But
   they can do more by way of preparation towards it. Suppose they do all
   they can towards it, will this save them, or will God upon this
   irresistibly work their conversion? No, they say, notwithstanding any
   preparatory work that we can do, conversion may not follow; how then
   does this mend the matter?

   But still they say the fault is in men's want of will, and not of
   power; "you will not come unto me, that ye might have life." But can
   they will to come? no, that they cannot neither. Why then it is still
   want of power that hinders them. The offer of life is a very gracious
   offer to them that are guilty, and liable to death, as we all are; but
   not if the condition be utterly impossible to us, though the
   impossibility springs from our own fault, as I will plainly shew by a
   fair instance. A prince offers a pardon to a traitor fast locked in
   chains, if he will come to him and submit himself; but if he be still
   detained in chains, and the prince do not some way or other help him to
   his liberty, it is so far from being a favour to offer him a pardon
   upon these terms, that it is a cruel derision of his misery, to say to
   him, You will not come to me that you may be pardoned; and this
   notwithstanding that his being cast into chains was the effect of his
   own crime and fault; the application is obvious. I should now proceed
   to answer an objection or two, and then to give a clear state of this
   matter, so as is most agreeable to Scripture, and the attributes and
   perfections of God; but this I shall reserve for another discourse.

SERMON CVII.

  OF THE NATURE OF REGENERATION, AND ITS NECESSITY, IN ORDER TO JUSTIFICATION
  AND SALVATION.

   For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature.--Galat. vi. 15.

   THE point which I am upon from these words is, that, according to the
   terms of the gospel, nothing will avail to our justification, but the
   real renovation of our hearts and lives.

   For the full explication of this, I propounded to shew,

   First, What is implied in this expression of the "new creature."

   Secondly, That this is the great condition of our justification and
   acceptance with God.

   Thirdly, That it is highly reasonable that this should be the condition
   of our justification.

   In speaking to the first of these, I have shewed, first, what this
   metaphor doth certainly import; and secondly, that it doth not import
   what some would extend it to, whereon to found such doctrines as these:

   First, That as the creation was an irresistible act of the Divine
   power, so is this new creation, or the conversion of a sinner.

   Secondly, As creatures were merely passive in their being made, and
   contributed nothing at all to it, no more do we in our conversion and
   regeneration.

   Thirdly, That as the creation of the several kinds and ranks of
   creatures was effected in an instant, by the powerful word of God,
   saying, Let such and such things be, and immediately they were; so this
   new creation is in an instant, and admits of no degrees.

   The first of these I have considered, and entered upon the second;
   namely, that as the creatures were merely passive in their being made,
   and contributed nothing at all thereto, no more do we in our conversion
   and regeneration.

   This I told yon does plainly make void all the precepts and
   exhortations, and all the promises and threatenings of Scripture, to
   argue and persuade men to repentance.

   That which remains to be done upon this argument, is,

   First, To answer an objection or two, which are commonly urged by the
   assertors of this doctrine, that we are merely passive in the work of
   conversion.

   Secondly, To give a clear state of this matter, so as is most agreeable
   to Scripture, and the attributes and perfections of God. For the

   First, The objections are these three:

   1. That if we be not merely passive in the work of regeneration and
   conversion, we ascribe the whole glory of this work to ourselves, and
   not to God.

   Or, secondly, We do, however, extenuate or lessen the grace of God, if
   there be any active concurrence and endeavours of our own towards this
   change.

   Thirdly, They ask St. Paul's question, "Who maketh thee to differ?" and
   think it impossible to be answered, if the efficacy of God's grace do
   depend upon our concurrence and compliance with it. These are all the
   material objections I know; to every one of which I hope to give a very
   clear and sufficient answer.

   1st Objection. If we be not merely passive in the work of regeneration
   and conversion, we ascribe the whole glory of this work to ourselves,
   and not to God. But that I certainly know this objection is commonly
   made, and have seen it in very consider able authors, I could not
   believe that men of so good sense could make it. For this is to say,
   that if we do any thing in this work, though we acknowledge that what
   we do in it, we do by the assistance of God's grace, we ascribe it
   wholly to ourselves, and rob God altogether of the glory of his grace;
   or, in plainer terms, it is to say, that though we say God does never
   so much, and we but very little in this work, yet if we do not say that
   God does all, and we nothing at all, we take the whole work to
   ourselves, and say God does nothing at all; which let any one that
   considers what we say, judge whether we say so or no.

   The Scripture, which never robs God of the glory of his grace, does I
   am sure ascribe our conversion and repentance, our regeneration and
   sanctification to several causes; to the Holy Spirit of God, to his
   ministers, to his word, and to ourselves. To the Holy Spirit of God, as
   the principal author, and efficient. Hence we are said "to be born of
   the Spirit, to be sanctified by the renewing of the Holy Ghost. To the
   ministers of God, as the instruments of our conversion. Hence they are
   said "to turn men to righteousness, to convert a sinner from the evil
   of his ways, to save souls from death, to pave themselves, and them
   that hear them; to be our spiritual fathers, and to beget us in
   Christ." To the word of God, as the subordinate means and instruments
   of our conversion. Hence we are said "to be begotten by the word of
   truth, to be sanctified by the truth." And lastly, to ourselves, as
   concurring some way or other to this work. Hence we are said "to
   believe and repent, to turn from our evil ways, and to turn to the
   Lord, to cleanse and purify ourselves." Hence, likewise, are those
   frequent commands in Scripture, "to amend our ways and doings, to wash
   our hearts from wickedness, to repent and turn ourselves, and to make
   ourselves new hearts and new spirits." So that all these causes, the
   Spirit of God, his ministers, his word, and we ourselves, do all some
   way or other concur and contribute to this effect. God indeed is the
   principal, and hath so great a hand in this work from beginning to end,
   that all the rest are nothing in comparison, and we do well to ascribe
   to him the whole glory of it, "that no flesh may glory in his sight:"
   but nevertheless, in strictness of speech, sufficiently warranted by
   Scripture, the ministers of God, and the word of God, and we ourselves,
   do all co-operate some way or other to our conversion and regeneration;
   and by ascribing to any of these such parts as they truly have in this
   work, God is not robbed of any part of the glory of his grace, much
   less of the whole. Much less is it the ascribing it all to ourselves,
   whom we affirm to have the least part in it, nor worthy to be mentioned
   in comparison of the riches of God's grace towards us. And yet, unless
   we do something, what can be the meaning of "making ourselves new
   hearts and new spirits?" Is it only that we should be passive to the
   irresistible operations of God's grace? that is, that we should not
   hinder, what we can neither hinder nor promote; that we should so
   demean ourselves, as of necessity we must whether we will or no. So
   then "to make ourselves new hearts and new spirits," is to do nothing
   at all towards the hinderance or furtherance of this work: and if this
   be the meaning of it, it is a precept and exhortation just as fit for
   stones, as for men; that is, very improper for either.

   2d Objection. But however, we do extenuate and lessen the grace of God,
   if there be any active concurrence and endeavours on our part towards
   this change. For answer to this, three things deserve to be considered:

   First, It is very well worthy our consideration, that they who make
   this objection, have the confidence to pretend that they do not
   diminish the grace of God, by confining it to a very small part of
   mankind in comparison; nay, they will needs face us down, that by this
   very thing they do very much exalt and magnify it, and that the grace
   of God is so much the greater, by how much the fewer they are that are
   partakers of it. But I hope they only mean that the grace is greater to
   themselves (in which conceit there is commonly as much of envy as
   gratitude); but surely they cannot mean that the grace which is limited
   to a few, is greater in itself, and upon the whole mat ter, than that
   which is extended to a great many; it being a downright contradiction,
   to say that the grace of God is magnified by being confined. For at
   this rate of reasoning, the lesser it is, the greater it must be, and
   by undeniable consequence would be greatest of all, if it were none at
   all. So that it the grace of God may be extenuated in favour of
   ourselves, but when we do so we must say we magnify it.

   Secondly, But to come close to the objection; though it be true, that
   if God's grace in our conversion do not do all, it does not do so much
   as if it did all; yet this is really no injury or dishonour to the
   grace of God; and though in some sense it doth extenuate it, it doth
   not in truth and reality take off from the glory of it. In my opinion,
   the grace and favour of a prince is not the less in offering a pardon
   to a traitor, who puts forth his hand and gladly receives it, than if
   he forced it upon him whether he would or no. I am sure, it is in the
   first case much fitter to give it, and he on whom it is conferred much
   better qualified to receive it. It is no disparagement to a prince's
   favour, that it is bestowed on one who is in some measure qualified to
   receive it. But be it more or less in one case than the other, this is
   certain, that in both cases the man owes his life to the great grace
   and goodness of his prince; and I cannot see how it lessens the grace,
   that the miserable object of it, the guilty and condemned person, was,
   either by his humble submission, or thankful acceptance of it, in some
   degree better qualified to receive such a favour, than an obstinate
   refuser of it.

   Thirdly, Which is the principal consideration of all, we must take
   great heed, that while we endeavour to make God to do all in the
   conversion of sinners, we do not by this means charge upon him the ruin
   and destruction of impenitent sinners, which I doubt we should do, if
   we make the reason of their impenitency and ruin their utter impotency
   and disability to repent; and we certainly make this the reason of
   their impenitency and ruin, if there be no other difference but this
   between penitent and impenitent sinners; namely, that in the one God
   works repentance by an irresistible act of his power, so that he cannot
   but repent, and denies this grace to the other, without which he cannot
   possibly repent. But the Scripture chargeth the destruction of men upon
   themselves, and lays their impenitency at their own door. "O Israel!
   thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thy help;" (Hosea xiii. 9.)
   But where is the help, when the grace absolutely necessary to
   repentance is denied? And how is their destruction of themselves, if it
   is unavoidable, let them do what they can? (Isa. v. 3, 4.) God appeals
   to his people Israel that no thing was wanting on his part, that was
   fit and necessary to be done, that they might bring forth the fruits of
   repentance, and better obedience: "And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem,
   and men of Judah, judge I pray you between me and my vineyard: what
   could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?
   Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it
   forth wild grapes?" Is it true that God hath done all that was
   necessary, to have brought them to repentance? Then if irresistible
   grace be necessary, he afforded them that; but that was not afforded
   them, because then they must unavoidably have repented, and there had
   been no cause for this complaint; if he did not afford it, but only the
   out ward means of repentance without the inward grace (as some say),
   then it is easy to judge why they did not repent; because they could
   not; and there seems to be no cause either of wonder, or complaint.
   Besides that, it will be hard to justify that saying, "What could I
   have done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?" when it is
   acknowledged by the assertors of this doctrine, that the main thing was
   not done, and that without which all the rest signified nothing,
   leaving them under the same impossibility of repentance, as if nothing
   at all had been done to them.

   But now, upon our supposition, that sufficient grace was afforded to
   them, which they wilfully neglected to make use of, the reason and
   equity of this complaint is evident, and God is acquitted, as having
   done what was needful on his part, and the sinner justly condemned, for
   not concurring with the grace of God as he might have done; which shews
   that we are not merely passive in this work; but something is expected
   from us, after God hath done his part, which if we neglect to do, our
   destruction is of ourselves. Whereas the contrary supposition, upon
   pretence of glorifying God's grace, by making him to do all in the
   conversion of sinners, endangers the honour of his justice, by laying
   the impenitency of sinners, and their ruin consequent upon it, at his
   door; which is to advance one attribute of God upon the ruin of
   another; when as it is a fundamental principle of religion, to take
   care to reconcile the attributes and perfections of God to one another;
   for that is not a Divine perfection, which contradicts any other
   perfection.

   The third objection is grounded upon that question of St. Paul, (1 Cor.
   iv. 7.) "Who maketh thee to differ?" which they think impossible to be
   answered, if the efficacy of God's grace depend upon our concurrence
   and compliance with it. For, say they, when God offers his grace to two
   persons for their repentance, if the true reason why the one repents,
   and the other remains impenitent, be this, that the one complieth with
   this grace of God, and yieldeth to it, the other resists and stands out
   against it; then it is not the grace of God which makes the difference,
   for that is equal to both, but something in themselves, and so it is
   not God that makes them to differ, but they themselves.

   But this question is impertinent to this case. The apostle speaks it
   concerning spiritual gifts, upon account of which they factiously
   admired some of the apostles above others, and concerning them the
   question is very proper, "who maketh thee to differ?" Miraculous gifts
   were so ordered by God, that men were merely passive in the receiving
   of them, and contributed nothing to the obtaining of them; and
   therefore, if one had greater gifts than another, it was merely the
   pleasure of God that made the difference. But the case is not the same
   in the graces of God's Spirit, towards the obtaining and improving
   whereof we ourselves may contribute something; our Saviour having
   assured us, that "to him that hath shall be given." And here the
   question is not proper, nor is it true, that the grace of God makes all
   the difference. It is indeed the foundation of all the good that is in
   us: but our different improvement makes different attainments in grace
   and goodness. Among those to whom the talents were entrusted, what made
   the difference between the man who wrapped his talent in the napkin,
   and buried it, and those who gained double by theirs, but that the one
   improved the grace conferred on him, the other neglected it, and this
   without any manner of reflection upon, or diminution of the grace of
   God, or any danger from St. Paul's question, "who maketh thee to
   differ?" Put the case: a pardon is offered to two malefactors, the one
   accepts, the other refuses it; their own choice makes the difference
   between them; but he that is saved is nevertheless beholden to the
   king's pardon for his life; and it were a senseless ingratitude in him,
   because he accepts the pardon, when the other refuseth it, to say, that
   he did not owe his life to the grace and favour of his prince, but
   might thank himself for it; whereas that he was in a capacity to accept
   a pardon, was wholly due to the clemency of his prince, who offered it
   to him when he no wise deserved it. In this case the thing plainly
   appears as it is; by which every man may see, that it is against common
   sense to pretend that the grace of God is destroyed, if there be any
   compliance on our part with it: that it is no grace, if it be not
   forced upon us, and we be not merely passive in the reception of it. I
   proceed, in the

   Second place, To give a clear state of this matter, so as is most
   agreeable to the doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, and the essential
   attributes and perfections of God. In order to which, I will give you a
   short view of the several opinions concerning this matter. And there
   are two extreme, and two middle opinions, concerning the operation of
   God's grace in the conversion of a sinner.

   The first of the extreme opinions is, that which all this while I have
   been arguing against; namely, that all that are converted and
   regenerated, are wrought upon in an irresistible manner, and are merely
   passive in it; and that those who are not thus wrought upon, their
   repentance and conversion is impossible. What the inconveniences of
   this opinion are, I have shewed at large.

   The other extreme opinion is, that none are thus wrought upon, because
   it would be a violence and injury to man's natural liberty; but that
   sufficient grace is offered to all, one time or other, who live under
   the gospel, which they may comply with or resist; and consequently, if
   they be not brought to repentance, their impenitency and ruin is the
   effect of their own choice, and God is free from the blood of all men.
   But this opinion, though infinitely more reasonable than the other,
   seems not to have any necessary foundation either in Scripture or
   reason. There are some instances in Scripture of the conversion of men
   after a very violent, if not an irresistible manner, which seems to be
   attributed to a particular predestination of God; as that of St. Paul,
   who says of himself, (Gal. i. 15.) that he was separated from his
   mother's womb to that work to which he was called; and the manner of
   his conversion was answerable to such a predestination; and there is
   nothing in reason against this, since it is no injury to any man to be
   made good and happy against his will.

   The two middle opinions are these:

   First, That irresistible grace is afforded to all the elect, and
   sufficient grace to all others who live under the gospel (for of those
   only we speak, the case of others being peculiar, and belonging to the
   extraordinary mercy of God); but then they say, that none of those to
   whom this sufficient grace is afforded shall effectually comply with
   it, and be saved. This opinion seems more moderate, and hath this
   advantage in it, that it acquits the justice of God in the condemnation
   of those, who, having sufficient grace afforded to them, did yet
   notwithstanding continue impenitent; but yet it hath two great in
   conveniences in it.

   First, That this supposition is to no purpose, as to any real effect
   for the salvation of men, because not one person more is saved,
   notwithstanding this universal sufficient grace, which they say is
   afforded to all; for they take it for granted it is never effectual;
   and then it seems very unreasonable to suppose, that a means sufficient
   to its end should universally prove ineffectual; nay, on the contrary,
   it is next to a demonstration against the sufficiency of a means, if
   perpetually and in all instances it fails of its end. This would tempt
   any man to think that surely there is some defect in it, or something
   that hinders the efficacy of it; if being perpetually and generally
   afforded, it doth perpetually and universally miscarry, without so much
   as one instance among so many millions to the contrary. So that this
   opinion seems rather to be contrived for a colour and shelter against
   some absurdity, which men know not how to avoid otherwise, than to
   serve any good purpose, or to be embraced for the truth and probability
   of it.

   The other middle opinion is, that some are converted in an irresistible
   manner when God pleaseth, and whom he designs to be extraordinary
   examples and instruments for the good of others, and that sufficient
   grace is afforded to others, which is effectual to the salvation of
   many, and rejected by a great many. And this avoids all the
   inconveniency of the other opinion, and is evidently most agreeable
   both to the tenor of Scripture and to the best notions which men have
   concerning the attributes and perfections of God, and gives greatest
   encouragement to the endeavours of men. It agrees very well with the
   solemn declarations of Scripture, that God is not wanting, on his part,
   to afford men sufficient means to bring them to repentance; that he
   "desires not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn from
   his wickedness and live;" that "he would have all men to be saved, and
   to come to the knowledge of the truth;" that "he would not that any
   should perish, but that all should come to repentance;" that men's
   destruction is of themselves. And this makes all the exhortations and
   motives of Scripture to repentance to be of some force and
   significancy, and gives encouragement to the resolutions and endeavours
   of men to be come better. This clearly acquits the justice of God in
   the condemnation of impenitent sinners, and fixeth the reason of their
   ruin upon their own choice. This perfectly reconciles the operation and
   assistance of God's grace in our conversion and regeneration, in our
   sanctification and perseverance in a good course, with the concurrence
   of our own endeavours, and makes those plain texts of Scripture have
   some sense and significancy in them: "Work out your own salvation;
   repent and turn yourselves from all your evil ways; make ye new hearts
   and new spirits." These are more than a thousand metaphors to convince
   a man, that we may, and ought to do, something towards our repentance
   and conversion. And if any man be sure that we neither do nor can do
   any thing in this work, then I am sure that these texts signify
   nothing. Finally, those texts which speak most clearly of the necessity
   of the Divine grace and assistance, to our doing of any thing that is
   spiritually good, do suppose something to be done on our part. That of
   our Saviour, "without me you can do nothing," implies, that with his
   grace and assistance we can. That of St. Paul, "lam able to do all
   things through Christ strengthening me," implies, that what we do by
   the strength of Christ, is truly our own act; "I am able to do all
   things." And this does not in the least prejudice nor obscure the glory
   of God's grace. St. Paul, it seems, knew very well how to reconcile
   these two, and to give the grace of God its due, without rejecting all
   concurrence of our own industry and endeavour: (1 Cor. xv. 10.) "But by
   the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace, which was bestowed upon
   me, was not in vain;" not because it was irresistible, and he merely
   passive in the reception of it; but because he did concur and
   co-operate with it. So he tells us, "his grace, that was bestowed upon
   me, was not in vain, but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet
   not I, but the grace of God which was with me." So that our concurrence
   and endeavour in the doing of any thing that is good, does not derogate
   from the grace of God, provided that we ascribe the good which we do to
   the assistance of Divine grace, to which it is incomparably more due
   than to our own activity and endeavour. And so St. Paul does: "I
   laboured abundantly; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with
   me."

   So that the glory of God's grace may be advanced to its due pitch,
   without asserting that we are merely passive to the operations of it.
   God's grace may be abundantly bestowed upon us, and yet we may labour
   abundantly; God may work in us "to will and to do," and yet we may work
   out our own salvation. I have done with the second doctrine, grounded
   upon this metaphor of a new creature.

SERMON CVIII.

  OF THE NATURE OF REGENERATION, AND ITS NECESSITY IN ORDER TO JUSTIFICATION AND
  SALVATION.

   For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature.--Galat. vi. 15.

   IN discoursing on these words, that which I was last upon, was to shew,
   that this metaphor of a new creature doth not import what some would
   extend it to, and that so as to found doctrines of great consequence
   upon the single strength of this, and other like metaphors; viz. such
   doctrines as these three:

   First, That as the creation was by an irresistible act of the Divine
   power, so is this new creation, or the conversion of a sinner.

   Secondly, That as creatures were merely passive in their being made,
   and contributed nothing at all thereto, no more do we to our conversion
   and regeneration.

   Thirdly, That as the creation was in an instant, only by the powerful
   word of God, so this new creation is in an instant, and admits of no
   degrees. The two first of these I have spoken to, and shewed, that as
   they had no necessary foundation in this and the like metaphors of
   Scripture, so they are contrary to reason and experience, and the plain
   and constant tenor of Scripture, which is the rule and measure of
   Christ's doctrine. I proceed, now, to consider the

   Third doctrine, which is grounded upon this metaphor; namely, that as
   the creation of the several ranks and orders of creatures was in an
   instant, and effected by the powerful word of God, saying, let such and
   such things be, and immediately they were; so this new creation is in
   an instant, and admits of no steps and degrees. And this doctrine is
   nothing else but a farther pursuit of the metaphor; and, admitting the
   two former doctrines to be true, and well-grounded upon this metaphor,
   this third doctrine follows well enough from them; for it is agreeable
   enough, that that which is effected by an irresistible act of omni
   potence, without any concurrence or operation on our part, should be
   done in an instant, and all at once. Not that this is necessary, but
   that it is reasonable; for why should Omnipotence use delays, and take
   time, and proceed by degrees in the doing of that, which, with the same
   ease, it can do at once, and in an instant; especially considering how
   well this suits with the other metaphors of Scripture, as well as with
   this of a new creation; viz. the metaphor of regeneration and
   resurrection. A child is born at once; and the dead shall be raised in
   a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.

   But, notwithstanding all this plausible appearance and conspiracy of
   metaphors, I shall shew that this doctrine of the conversion and
   regeneration of a sinner being effected in an instant, and all at once,
   is not well grounded, either upon Scripture or experience. Not but that
   God can do so if he pleaseth, and works this change in some much sooner
   and quicker than in others; but there is nothing, either in Scripture
   or experience, to persuade us that this is the usual, much less the
   constant and unalterable method of God's grace in the conversion of a
   sinner, to bring it about in an instant, without any sensible steps and
   degrees.

   But, for the full clearing of this matter, I shall proceed by these
   steps:

   First, I shall shew upon what mistaken grounds and principles this
   doctrine relies; besides the metaphors already mentioned, which I have
   shewn to be of no force to prove the thing.

   Secondly, I shall plainly shew what regeneration is; by which it will
   appear, that it is not necessarily effected in an instant, and at once,
   but admits of degrees.

   Thirdly, That it is evidently so in experience of the ordinary method
   of God's grace, both in those who are regenerated by a pious and
   religious education, and in those who are reclaimed from a vicious
   course of life.

   Fourthly, That all this is very consonant and agreeable to what the
   Scripture plainly and constantly declares concerning it.

   First, I shall discover several mistakes upon which this doctrine is
   grounded, besides the metaphors already mentioned, and which I have
   shewn to be of no force to prove the thing; viz. That regeneration is
   in an instant, and admits of no degrees. As,

   1. That regeneration and sanctification are not only different
   expressions, but do signify two things really different. But this is a
   gross mistake; for regeneration and sanctification are but different
   expressions of the self-same thing; for regeneration is a metaphor
   which the Scripture useth to express our translation and change from
   one state to another; from a state of sin and wickedness to a state of
   grace and holiness, as if we were born over again, and were the
   children of another father; and, from being the children of the devil,
   did become the children of God; and sanctification is our being made
   holy, our being purified and cleansed from sin and impurity. And hence
   it is, that regeneration and sanctification are attributed to the same
   causes, principal and instrumental, to the Spirit of God, and to the
   word of God. We are said to be "born of the Spirit," and to be
   "sanctified by the Holy Ghost;" to be begotten of the "word of truth,"
   and to be "sanctified by the truth," which is, "the word of God." So
   that the Scripture speaks of them as the same thing; and they must
   needs be so; for if sanctification be the making of us holy, and
   regeneration maketh us holy, then regeneration is sanctification.

   2. It is said that regeneration only signifies our first entrance into
   this state, and sanctification our progress and continuance in it. But
   this likewise is a great mistake: for though it be true that
   regeneration doth signify our first entrance into this state, yet it is
   not true that it only signifies that; for it is used likewise in
   Scripture to signify our continuance in that state; for Christians are
   said to be the "children of God," and consequently in a regenerate
   state; not only in the instant of this change, but during their
   continuance in it. Besides that, our first change is as well called our
   sanctification, as our progress and continuance in a state of holiness.
   So that neither in this is there any difference between regeneration
   and sanctification. They do both of them signify both our first
   entrance into an holy state, and our continuance; and progress in it;
   though regeneration do more frequently denote the making of this
   change, and our first entrance into it.

   3. It is said that one of the main differences between regeneration and
   sanctification is this--that regeneration is incapable of degrees, and
   all that are regenerate are equally so, and one regenerate person is
   not more or less regenerate than another; whereas sanctification is a
   gradual progress from one degree of holiness to another, and of them
   that are truly sanctified and holy, one may be more sanctified and more
   holy than another. But this likewise is a mere fancy and imagination,
   without any real ground. For as an unregenerate state does plainly
   admit of degrees, so likewise doth the regenerate, and for the same
   reason. That an unregenerate state admits of degrees is evident, in
   that some unregenerate persons are more wicked than others, and thereby
   more the children of wrath and the devil than others, which are the
   Scripture expressions concerning the degrees of men's wickedness and
   impiety. In like manner, they that are more holy, and more like God,
   are more the children of God; and to be more a child of God, is surely
   to be more regenerate; that is, more renewed after the image of God,
   which consists in righteousness and true holiness. So that it is a mere
   precarious assertion, and evidently false to affirm, that regeneration
   doth not admit of degrees, and that one is not more regenerate than
   another.

   Fourthly and lastly, They ground this conceit upon the doctrine of the
   schools, which teach, that in regeneration and conversion all the
   habits of grace are infused, simul et semel, together and at once. I
   confess I have no regard, much less a veneration, for the doctrine of
   the schools, where it differs from that of the Holy Scriptures, which
   say not one word of infused habits, which yet are much talked of in
   divinity; and, to speak the truth, these words serve only to obscure
   the thing. For to say that in conversion the habits of all graces and
   virtues are infused together and at once, is to say, that, in an
   instant, men that were vicious before in several kinds are, by an
   omnipotent act of God's grace, and by a new principle infused into
   them, endued with the habits of the contrary graces and virtues, and
   are as chaste, and temperate, and just, and meek, and humble, as if, by
   the frequent practice of these virtues, they had become so. That this
   may be, and sometimes is, I am so far from denying, that I believe it
   to be so. Some men, by an extraordinary power of God's grace upon their
   hearts, are suddenly changed, and strangely reclaimed from a very
   wicked and vicious, to a very religious and virtuous course of life;
   and that which others attain to by slower degrees, and great conflicts
   with themselves, before they can gain the upper hand of their lusts,
   these arrive at, all on a sudden, by a mighty resolution wrought in
   them by the power of God's grace, and as it were a new bias and
   inclination put upon their souls, equal to an habit gained by long use
   and custom. This God sometimes does, and when he does this, it may in
   some sense be called the in fusion of the habits of grace and virtue
   together, and at once; because the man is hereby endowed with a
   principle of equal force and power with habits that are acquired by
   long use and practice. A strong and vigorous faith is the principle and
   root of all graces and virtues, and may have such a powerful influence
   upon the resolutions of our minds, and the government of our actions,
   that from this principle all graces and virtues may spring and grow up
   by degrees into habits; but then this principle is not formally but
   virtually, in the power and efficacy of it, the infusion of the habits
   of every grace and virtue; and even in those persons, in whom this
   change is so suddenly, and as it were at once, I doubt not but that the
   habits of several graces and virtues are afterwards attained by the
   frequent practice of them, in the virtue of this powerful principle of
   the faith of the gospel, as I shall shew in the progress of this
   discourse. And this, I doubt not, was very frequent and visible in many
   of the first converts to Christianity; especially of those who, from
   the abominable idolatry and impiety of heathenism, were gained to the
   Christian religion. The Spirit of God did then work very miraculously,
   as well in the cures of spiritual as of bodily diseases. But then, to
   make this the rule and standard of God's ordinary proceedings, in the
   conversion and regeneration of men, is equally unreasonable, as still
   to expect miracles for the cure of diseases; and it is certain in
   experience, that this is not God's ordinary method in the conversion of
   sinners, as I shall fully shew by and by.

   Secondly, I shall shew what regeneration is; by which it will plainly
   appear, that there is no necessity that it should be effected in an
   instant, and at once, but that it will admit of degrees. I do not deny
   that it may be in an instant, and at once. The power of God is able to
   do this, and sometimes does it very thoroughly and very suddenly. But
   the question is, whether there be a necessity it should be so, and
   always be so. Now regeneration is--the change of a man's state, from a
   state of sin to a state of holiness; which, because it is an entrance
   upon a new kind or course of life, it is fitly resembled to
   regeneration, or a new birth; to a new creation; the man being, as it
   were, quite changed, or made over again, so as not to he, as to the
   main purpose and design of his life, the same man he was before. This
   is a plain sensible account of the thing, which every one may easily
   understand. Now there is nothing in reason, why a man may not gradually
   be changed and arrive at this state by degrees, as well as after this
   change is made, and he arrived at this state of a regenerate man, he
   may by degrees grow and improve in it. But the latter no man doubts of,
   but that a man that is in a state of grace may grow and improve in
   grace; and there is as little reason to question why a man may not come
   to this state by degrees, as well as leap into it at once.

   All the difficulty I know of in this matter is a mere nicety, that
   there is an instant in which every thing begins, and therefore
   regeneration is in an instant; so that the instant before the man
   arrived at this state, it could not be said that he was regenerate; and
   the instant after he is in this state, it cannot be denied that he is
   so. But this is idle subtilty, just as if a man should prove that a
   house was built in an instant, because it could not be said to be built
   till the instant it was finished; though, for all this, nothing is more
   certain than that it was built by degrees. Or, suppose the time of
   arriving at man's estate be at one and twenty, does it from hence
   follow, that a man does not grow to be a man by degrees, but is made a
   man in an instant; because just before one and twenty he was not at
   man's estate, and just then he was? Not but that God, if he please, can
   make a man in an instant, as he did Adam; but it is not necessary, from
   this example, that all men should be made so, much less does it follow
   from this vain subtilty. This is just the case. All the while the man
   is tending towards a regenerate state, and is struggling with his
   lusts, till, by the power of God's grace, and his own resolution, he
   get the victory; all the while he is under the sense and conviction of
   his sinful and miserable state, and sorrowing for the folly of his past
   life, and coming to an effectual purpose and resolution of changing his
   course; and it may be several times thrown back by the temptations of
   the devil, and the power of evil habits, and the weakness and in
   stability of his own purpose, till, at last, by the grace of God
   following and assisting him, he comes to a firm resolution of a better
   life, which resolution governs him for the future; I say all this
   while, which in some persons is longer, in others shorter, according to
   the power of evil habits, and the different degrees of God's grace
   afforded to men: all this time the work of regeneration is going on;
   and though a man cannot be said to be in a regenerate state till that
   very instant that the principle of grace and his good resolution have
   got the upper hand of his lusts, yet it is certain, for all this, that
   the work of regeneration was not effected in an instant. This is
   plainly and truly the case, as I shall shew in the

   Third particular I propounded; namely, that it is evident from
   experience of the ordinary methods of God's grace, both in those who
   are regenerate by a pious and religious education, and those who are
   reclaimed from a vicious course of life.

   The first sort, namely, those who are brought to goodness by a
   religious and virtuous education; these (at least, so far as my
   observation reacheth) make up a very considerable part of the number of
   the regenerate; that is, of good men. And though it be certain,
   considering the universal corruption and degeneracy of human nature,
   that there is a real change made in them, by the operation of God's
   grace upon their minds, yet it is as certain in experience, that this
   change is made in very many by very silent and insensible degrees, till
   at length the seeds of religion, which were planted in them by a good
   education, do visibly prevail over all the evil inclinations of corrupt
   nature, so as to sway and govern the actions of their lives; and when
   the principles of grace and goodness do apparently prevail, we may
   conclude them to be in a regenerate state, though, perhaps, very few of
   these can give any account of the particular time and occasion of this
   change. For things may be seen in their effect, which were never very
   sensible in their cause. And it is very reasonable, that such persons,
   who never lived in any evil course, should escape those pangs and
   terrors which unavoidably happen unto others, from a course of actual
   sin, and the guilt of a wicked life; and if there be any such persons
   as I have described, who are, in this gradual and insensible manner,
   regenerated and made good; this is a demonstration that there is no
   necessity that this change should be in an instant, it being so
   frequently found to be otherwise in experience.

   And as for others who are visibly reclaimed from a notorious wicked
   course, in these we likewise frequently see this change gradually made
   by strong impressions made upon their minds, most frequently by the
   word of God; sometimes by his providence, whereby they are convinced of
   the evil and danger of their course, and awakened to consideration, and
   melted into sorrow and repentance; and, perhaps, exercised with great
   terrors of conscience, till at length, by the grace of God, they come
   to a fixed purpose and resolution of forsaking their sins, and turning
   to God; and, after many strugglings and conflicts with their lusts, and
   the strong bias of evil habits, this resolution, assisted by the grace
   of God, doth effectually prevail, and make a real change both in the
   temper of their minds, and the course of their lives; and when this is
   done, and not before, they are said to be regenerate. But all the while
   this was doing, the new man was forming, and the work of regeneration
   was going on; and it was, perhaps, a very considerable time, from the
   beginning of it, till it came to a fixed and settled state. And this, I
   doubt not, in experience of most persons who are reclaimed from a
   vicious course of life, is found to be the usual and ordinary method of
   God's grace in their conversion; and, if so, it is in vain to pretend
   that a thing is done in an instant, which by so manifold experience is
   found to take up a great deal of time, and to be effected by degrees.

   And whereas some men are pleased to call all this the preparatory work
   to regeneration, but not the regeneration itself; this is an idle
   contention about words. For if these preparations be a degree of
   goodness, and a gradual tendency towards it, then the work is begun by
   them, and, during the continuance of them, is all the while a doing;
   and though it be hard to fix the point or instant when a man just
   arrives at this state, and not before, yet it is very sensible when a
   man is in it; and this change, when it is really made, will soon
   discover itself by plain and sensible effects.

   Fourthly and lastly, All this is very agreeable to the plain and
   constant tenor of Scripture, (Isa. i. l6.) where the prophet exhorts to
   this change, he speaks of it as a gradual thing, "Wash ye, make you
   clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to
   do evil, learn to do well;" that is, break off evil and vicious habits,
   and gain the contrary habits of virtue and goodness by the exercise of
   it. The Scripture speaks of some as farther from a state of grace than
   others: (Jer. xiii. 23.) "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
   leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do
   evil;" plainly declaring the great difficulty, equal almost to a
   natural impossibility, of reclaiming those to goodness, who have been
   long habituated to an evil course. And the Scripture speaks of some as
   nearer to a state of grace than others. Our Saviour tells the young man
   in the gospel, who said he had kept the commands of God from his youth,
   that he was "not far from the kingdom of God." But now, if, by an
   irresistible act of God's power, this change be made in an instant, and
   cannot otherwise be made, how is one man nearer to a state of grace, or
   farther from it than another? If all that are made good, must be made
   so in an instant, or not at all, then no man is nearer being made good
   than another; for if he were nearer to it, he might sooner be made so;
   but that cannot be, if all must be made good in an instant; for sooner
   than that no man can be made so. If the similitude of our being dead in
   sins and trespasses be strictly taken, no man is nearer a resurrection
   to a new life than another: as he that died but a week ago, is as far
   from being raised to life again, as he that died a thousand years ago;
   the resurrection of both requires an omnipotent act, and to that both
   are equally easy.

   The two parables of our Saviour, (Matt. xiii. 31. 33.) are by many
   interpreters understood of the gradual operation of grace upon the
   hearts of men. That wherein "the kingdom of heaven is likened to a
   grain of mustard-seed, which being sown was the least of all seeds,"
   but, by degrees, "grew up to be the greatest of herbs;" and "to leaven,
   which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole
   was leavened:" intimating the progress of God's grace, which by degrees
   diffuseth itself over the whole temper of a man's mind, into all the
   actions of his life. To be sure the parable of "the seed, which fell
   upon good ground," does represent the efficacy of the word of God,
   accompanied by his grace upon the minds of men, and that is said to
   spring up, and increase, and to bring forth fruit with patience; which
   surely does express to us the gradual operation of God's word and grace
   in the renovation and change of a man's heart and life.

   The New Testament, indeed, speaks of the sudden change of many upon the
   first preaching of the gospel, which I have told you before is not a
   standard of the ordinary method of God's grace; the not considering of
   which hath been a great cause of all the mistakes in this matter. It is
   true, those which were thus converted to the belief of the gospel,
   their faith was a virtual principle of all grace and virtue, though not
   formerly the habit of every particular grace. St. Paul himself, who was
   a prime instance of this kind, speaks as if he acquired the grace of
   contentment by great consideration and diligent care of himself in
   several conditions; not as if the habit of this grace had been infused
   into him at once: (Phil. iv. 11, 12.) I have learned in whatsoever
   state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and
   I know how to abound; every where and in all things I am instructed,
   both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer need."
   And thus I have done with the first thing I propounded to consider;
   namely, the true and just importance of this metaphor of the new
   creation. The two particulars which remain, I shall, by God's
   assistance, finish in my next discourse.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CIX.

  OF THE NATURE OF REGENERATION, AND ITS NECESSITY, IN ORDER TO JUSTIFICATION
  AND SALVATION,

   For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature.--Gal. vi. 15.

   THE observation I am still upon from these words is this: viz. That in
   the Christian religion nothing will avail to our justification, but the
   renovation of our hearts and lives, expressed here by "a new creature."
   In treating of which, I proposed the doing of three things:

   First, To shew the true import of this metaphor of "a new creature."

   Secondly, To shew that this is the great condition of our
   justification; and,

   Thirdly, That it is highly reasonable that it should be so.

   In treating of the first of these particulars, I have considered some
   doctrines as founded upon this metaphor, which I have shewn at large
   not only to have no foundation in Scripture, or reason, or experience,;
   but also to be very unreasonable in themselves, and contrary to the
   plain and constant tenor of Scripture, and to the ordinary method of
   God's grace in the regeneration of men, whether by a religious and
   virtuous education, or in those who are reclaimed from a notorious
   wicked course of life. And that I have so long insisted upon this
   argument, and handled it in a more contentious way than is usual with
   me, did not proceed from any love to controversy, which I am less fond
   of every day than other; but from a great desire to put an end to these
   controversies, and quarrellings in the dark, by bringing them to a
   clear state and plain issue, and likewise to undeceive good men
   concerning some current notions and doctrines, which I do really
   believe to be dishonourable to God, and contrary to the plain
   declarations of Scripture, and a cause of great perplexity and
   discomfort to the minds of men, and a real discouragement to the
   resolutions and endeavours of becoming better. Upon which
   considerations I was strongly urgent to search these doctrines to the
   bottom, and to contribute what in me lay, to the rescuing of good men
   from the disquiet and entanglement of them.

   I will conclude this matter with a few cautions, not unworthy to be
   remembered by us: that we would be careful so to ascribe all good to
   God, that we be sure we ascribe nothing to him that is evil, or any
   ways unworthy of him; that we do not make him the sole author of our
   salvation, in such a way, as will unavoidably charge upon him the final
   impenitency and ruin of a great part of mankind; that we do not so
   magnify the grace of God, as to make his precepts and exhortations
   signify nothing; such as these: "Make ye new hearts, and new spirits,
   strive to enter in at the strait gate;" where, if by the strait gate be
   meant the difficulty of our first entrance upon a religious course,
   that is, of our conversion and regeneration, I cannot imagine how it is
   possible to reconcile our being merely passive in this work, and doing
   nothing at all in it, with our Saviour's precept of striving "to enter
   in at the strait gate; unless to be very active and to be merely
   passive about the same thing be all one, and an earnest contention and
   endeavour be the same thing with doing nothing. Again, that we do not
   make the utmost degeneracy and depravation which men ever arrived at by
   the greatest abuse of themselves, and the most vile and wicked
   practices, the standard of an unregenerate state, and of the common
   condition of all men by nature. And, lastly, that we do not make some
   particular instances in Scripture, of the strange and sudden conversion
   of some persons, (as namely, of St. Paul and the jailor, in the Acts)
   the common rule and measure of every man's conversion; so that unless a
   man be, as it were, struck down by a light and power from heaven, and
   taken with a lit of trembling, and frighted almost out of his wits, or
   find in himself something equal to this, he can have no assurance of
   his conversion; whereas a much surer judgment may be made of the
   sincerity of a man's conversion, by the real effects of this change,
   than by the manner of it. This our Saviour hath taught us, by that apt
   resemblance of the operation of God's Spirit to the blowing of the
   wind, of the original cause whereof, and of the reason of its ceasing
   or continuance, and why it blows stronger or gentler, this way or that
   way, we are altogether ignorant; but that it is, we are sensible from
   the sound of it: (John iii. 8.) "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
   thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell whence it cometh, nor
   whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit." The
   effects of God's Holy Spirit in the regeneration of men are sensible,
   though the manner and degrees of his operation upon the souls of men
   are so various, that we can give no account of them; by winch, one
   would think, our Saviour had sufficiently cautioned us, not to reduce
   the operations of God's grace and Holy Spirit in the regeneration of
   men, to any certain rule or standard, but chiefly to regard the
   sensible effects of this secret work upon the hearts and lives of men.

   And, after all, it is in vain to contend by any arguments against clear
   and certain experience. If we plainly see that many are insensibly
   changed, and made good by pious education "in the nurture and
   admonition of the Lord;" and that some who have long lived in a profane
   neglect and contempt of religion, are by the secret power of God's word
   and Holy Spirit, upon calm consideration, without any great terrors and
   amazements, visibly changed and brought to a better mind and course; it
   is in vain, in these cases, to pretend that this change is not real,
   because the manner of it is not answer able to some instances which are
   recorded in Scripture, or which we have observed in our experience; and
   because these persons cannot give such an account of the time and
   manner of their conversion, as is agreeable to these instances; which
   is just as if I should meet a man beyond sea, whom I had known in
   England, and would not believe that he had crossed the seas, because he
   said he had a smooth and easy passage, and was wafted over by a gentle
   wind, and could tell no stories of storms and tempests.

   And thus I have fully and faithfully endeavoured to open to you the
   just importance of this phrase or expression in the text, of the "new
   creature," or the new creation. I proceed to the

   Second particular I propounded; namely, That the real renovation of our
   hearts and lives, is, according to the terms of the gospel and the
   Christian religion, the great condition of our justification and
   acceptance with God, and that this is the same in sense and substance
   with those phrases in the parallel texts to this, of faith perfected by
   charity, and of keeping the commandments of God.

   That, according to the terms of the gospel, the great condition of our
   justification and acceptance with God, is the real renovation of our
   hearts and lives, is plain, not only from this text, which affirms,
   that, in the Christian religion, nothing will avail us but the "new
   creature;" but, likewise, from many other clear texts of Scripture; and
   this, whether by justification be meant our first justification upon
   our faith and repentance, or our continuance in this state, or our
   final justification by our solemn acquittal and absolution at the great
   day, which in Scripture is called "salvation" and "eternal life."

   That this is the condition of our first justification; that is, of the
   forgiveness of our sins, and our being received into the grace and
   favour of God, is plain from all those texts where this change is
   expressed by our repentance and conversion, by our regeneration and
   renovation, by our purification and sanctification, or by any other
   terms of the like importance. For under every one of these notions,
   this change is made the condition of the forgiveness of our sins, and
   acceptance to the favour of God.

   Under the notion of repentance and conversion. (Acts ii. 38.) "Repent
   and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
   remission of sins." (Acts iii. 19.) "Repent and be converted, that your
   sins may be blotted out." Upon the same account, the penitent
   acknowledgment of our sins, which is an essential part of repentance,
   is made a condition of the forgiveness of them. (1 John i. 9.) "If we
   confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and
   to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Under the notion of
   regeneration and renovation. (2 Cor. v. 17.) "If any man be in Christ,
   (that is, become a true Christian, which is all one with being in a
   justified state) he is a new creature; old things are passed away,
   behold all things are become new:" (Tit. iii. 3-7.) where the apostle
   declares at large what change is required to put us into a justified
   state, and to entitle us to the inheritance of eternal life: "for we
   ourselves were also sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving
   divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and
   hating one another. But after that the kindness and love of God our
   Saviour towards man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we
   have done, (that is, not for any precedent righteousness of ours, for
   we were great sinners) but according to his mercy he saved us, by the
   washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he
   shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that, being
   justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope
   of eternal life." So that the change of our former temper, and
   conversion, and regeneration, and "the renewing of the Holy Ghost," is
   antecedently necessary to our justification; that is, to the pardon of
   our sins, and our restitution to the favour of God, and the hope of
   eternal life. So, likewise, under the notion of purification and
   sanctification, (1 Cor. vi. 9-11.) where the apostle enumerates several
   sins and vices, which will certainly exclude men from the favour and
   kingdom of God, from which we must be cleansed before we can be
   justified or saved: "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit
   the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor
   idolaters, nor adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,
   nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And
   such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye
   are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
   God," (2 Cor. vi. 17, 18.) where the apostle, likewise, makes our
   purification a condition of our being received into the favour of God,
   and reckoned into the number of his children: "touch not the unclean
   thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and ye
   shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." And that by
   not touching "the unclean thing," is here certainly meant our
   sanctification and purification from sin, is evident from what
   immediately follows in the beginning of the next chapter; "having
   therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
   all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear
   of God;" that is, having this encouragement, that upon this condition
   we shall be received to the favour of God, let us purify ourselves,
   that we may be capable of this great blessing.

   And our continuance in this state of grace and favour with God, depends
   upon our perseverance in holiness; for "if any man draw back, my soul
   shall have no pleasure in him."

   And, lastly, This is also the condition of our final justification and
   absolution, by the sentence of the great day: (Matt. v. 8.) "Blessed
   are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." (John iii. 3.) "Except
   a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." (Heb. xii. 14.)
   "Follow holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord." (1 John
   iii. 3.) The apostle there, speaking of the blessed sight and enjoyment
   of God, tells ns what we must do if ever we hope to be partakers of it:
   "Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is
   pure."

   And this condition here mentioned in the text, of our being new
   creatures, is the same in sense and substance with those expressions
   which we find in the two parallel texts to this, where faith, which is
   perfected by charity, and keeping the commandments of God, are made the
   condition of our justification and acceptance with God. (Gal. v. 6.)
   "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but faith, which is consummate" or "made perfect by
   charity;" and (1 Cor. vii. 19.) "Circumcision is nothing, and
   uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God."
   It is evident that the design and meaning of these three texts is the
   same, and therefore these three expressions of the "new creature," and
   of "faith perfected by charity," and of "keeping the commandments of
   God," do certainly signify the same thing. That the "new creature"
   signifies the change of our state, from a state of disobedience and
   sin, to a state of obedience and holiness of life, I have shewn at
   large; and the apostle explaining this new creation, most expressly
   tells us, (Ephes. ii. 10.) "We are his workmanship, created in Christ
   Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we should
   walk in them;" and, (Colos. iii. 10. 12-14.) where the apostle tells
   them, that they ought to give testimony of their renovation, and having
   put on "the new man," by all the fruits of obedience and goodness; u ye
   have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image
   of him that created him. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy
   and beloved, bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
   long-suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; and
   above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
   perfection." And the apostle St. Peter tells us, that our regeneration,
   which he calls sanctification of the Spirit, is unto obedience." (1
   Pet. i. 2.) So that our renovation consisteth in the principle and
   practice of obedience, and a good life; and what is this but faith
   perfected by charity? And charity, the apostle tells us, "is the
   fulfilling of the Jaw;" and what is "the fulfilling of the law," but
   "keeping the commandments of God?" And "keeping the commandments of
   God," or, at least, a sincere resolution of obedience, when there is
   not time and opportunity for the trial of it, is in Scripture as
   expressly made a condition both of our present and final justification
   and acceptance with God, as faith is; and in truth is the same with a
   living and operative faith, and a faith that is consummate, and made
   perfect by charity. (Acts x. 34, 35.) "Of a truth I perceive (saith St.
   Peter) that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that
   feareth him and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him;" which
   speech does, as plainly as words can do any thing, declare to us upon
   what terms all mankind, of what condition or nation soever, may find
   acceptance with God. (Rom. ii. 6-10.) "Who will render to every man
   according to his deeds: to them who by patient continuance in
   well-doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life;
   but to them who are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey
   unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish upon
   every soul of man that doth evil; of the Jew first, and also of the
   gentile: but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good,
   to the Jew first, and also to the gentile." As to our acceptance with
   God, and the rewards of another world, it matters not whether Jew or
   gentile, circumcised or uncircumcised; that which maketh the
   difference, is obeying the truth, or obeying unrighteousness; working
   good, or doing evil; these are the things which will avail to our
   justification, or condemnation, at the great day. To the same purpose
   is that saying of the apostle to the Hebrews, (chap. v. 9.) that
   "Christ is the author of eternal salvation to them that obey him."

   I will conclude this matter with two remarkable sayings; the one
   towards the beginning, the other towards the end of the Bible; to
   satisfy us that this is the tenor of the Holy Scriptures, and the
   constant doctrine of it from the beginning to the end. (Gen. iv. 7.) It
   is God's speech to Cain, "If thou dost well, shalt thou not be
   accepted?" and (Rev. xxii. 14.) "Blessed are they that do his
   commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may
   enter in through the gates into the city."

   And thus I have done with the second thing I propounded; which was to
   shew, that according to the terms of the gospel, and the Christian
   religion, the real renovation of our hearts and lives is the great
   condition of our justification and acceptance with God, and that t his
   in sense and substance is tin same with faith "made perfect with
   charity," and keeping the commandments of God.

   The third and last particular remains to be spoken to; namely, That it
   is highly reasonable that this should be the condition of our
   justification and acceptance to the favour of God; and that upon these
   two accounts:

   First, For the honour of God's holiness.

   Secondly, In order to the qualifying of us for the favour of God, and
   the enjoyment of him, for the pardon of our sins, and the reward of
   eternal life.

   First, For the honour of God's holiness. For should God have received
   men to his favour, and rewarded them with eternal glory and happiness,
   for the mere belief of the gospel, or a confident persuasion that
   Christ would save them, without any change of their hearts and lives,
   without repentance from dead works, and fruits meet for repentance, and
   amendment of life; he had not given sufficient testimony to the world
   of his love to holiness and righteousness, and of his hatred of sin and
   iniquity. The apostle tells us, that God in the justification of a
   sinner declares his righteousness; but should he justify men upon other
   terms, this would not declare his righteousness, and love of holiness,
   but rather an indifferency, whether men were good and righteous or not.
   For a bare assent to the truth of the gospel, without the fruits of
   holiness and obedience, is not a living, but a dead faith, and so far
   from being acceptable to God, that it is an affront to him; and a
   confident reliance upon Christ for salvation, while we continue in our
   sins, is not a justifying faith, but a bold and impudent presumption
   upon the mercy of God, and the merits of our Saviour; who indeed
   justifies the ungodly; that is, those that have been so, but not those
   that continue so. And if God should pardon sinners, and reward them
   with eternal life, upon any other terms than upon our becoming new
   creatures, than upon such a faith as is "made perfect by charity;" that
   is, by keeping the commands of God; this would be so far from declaring
   his righteousness, and being a testimony of his hatred and displeasure
   against sin, that it would give the greatest countenance and
   encouragement to it imaginable.

   Secondly, It is likewise very reasonable, that such a faith, that makes
   us new creatures, and is perfected by charity, and keeping the
   commandments of God, should be the condition of justification, in order
   to the qualifying of us for the pardon of our sins, and the reward of
   eternal life; that is, for the favour of God, and for the enjoyment of
   him. To forgive men upon other terms, were to give countenance and
   encouragement to perpetual rebellion and disobedience. That man is not
   fit to be forgiven, who is so far from being sorry for his fault, that
   he goes on to offend; he is utterly incapable of mercy, who is not
   sensible that he hath done amiss, and resolved to amend. No prince ever
   thought a rebellious subject capable of pardon upon lower terms than
   these. It is in the nature of the thing unfit that an obstinate
   offender should have any mercy or favour shewn to him.

   And as without repentance and resolution of bet ter obedience, we are
   unfit for forgiveness, so much more for a reward; as we cannot expect
   God's favour, so we are incapable of the enjoyment of him without
   holiness. Holiness is the image of God, and makes us like to him; and,
   till we be like him, we cannot see him, we can have no enjoyment of
   him. All delightful communion and agreeable society is founded on a
   similitude of disposition and manners; and therefore so long as we are
   unlike to God in the temper and disposition of our minds, and in the
   actions and course of our lives, neither can God take pleasure in us,
   nor we in him, but there will be a perpetual jarring and discord
   between him and us; and though we were in heaven, and seated in the
   place of the blessed, yet we should not, nay we could not, be happy;
   because we should want the necessary materials and ingredients of
   happiness. For it is with the soul, in this respect, as it is with the
   body; though all things be easy without us, and no cruelty be exercised
   upon us, to give torment and vexation to us, yet if we be inwardly
   diseased, we may have pain and anguish enough; we may be as it were
   upon the rack, and feel as great torment from the inward disorder of
   our humours, as if we were tortured from without. So it is with the
   soul; sin and vice are internal diseases, which do naturally create
   trouble and discontent, and nothing but diversion, and the variety of
   objects and pleasures, which entertain men in this world, hinders a
   wicked man from being out of his wits, whenever he reflects upon
   himself; for all the irregular appetites and passions, lust, and
   malice, and revenge, are so many furies within us; and though there
   were no devil to torment us, yet the disorder of our own minds, and the
   horrors of a guilty conscience, would be a hell to us, and make us
   extremely miserable in the very regions of happiness. So that it is
   necessary that our faith should be "made perfect by charity," and that
   we should become new creatures; not only from the arbitrary
   constitution and appointment of God, but from the nature and reason of
   the thing; because nothing but this can dispose us for that
   blessedness, which God hath promised to us, and prepared for us. Faith,
   considered abstractedly from the fruits of holiness and obedience, of
   goodness and charity, will bring no man into the favour of God. All the
   excellency of faith is, that it is the principle of a good life, and
   furnisheth us with the best motives and arguments thereto, the promises
   and threatenings of the gospel; and therefore in heaven, when we come
   to sight and enjoyment, faith and hope shall cease, but "charity never
   faileth;" for if it should, heaven would cease to be heaven to us,
   because it is the very frame and temper of happiness; and if this
   disposition be not wrought in us in this world, we shall be altogether
   incapable of the felicity of the other.

   You see, then, what it is that must recommend us to the favour of God;
   the real renovation of our hearts and lives, "after the image of him
   that created us." This must be repaired in us, before ever we can Lope
   to be restored to the grace and favour of God, or to be capable of the
   reward of eternal life. And what could God have done more reasonable,
   than to make these very things the terms of our salvation, which are
   the necessary causes and means of it? How could he have dealt more
   mercifully and kindly with us, than to appoint that to be the condition
   of our happiness, which is the only qualification that can make us
   capable of it?

   I will conclude all with that excellent passage in the Wisdom of
   Solomon: (chap. vi. 17, 18.) "The very true beginning of wisdom is the
   desire of discipline, and the care of discipline is love, and love is
   the keeping of her laws, and taking heed to her laws is the assurance
   of incorruption." The sum of what I have said upon this argument
   amounts to this, that upon the terms of the gospel we can have no hope
   of the forgiveness of our sins and eternal salvation, unless our nature
   be renewed, and the image of God, which is defaced by sin, be repaired
   in us, and we be created in Christ unto good works; that no faith will
   avail to our justification and acceptance with God, but that which is
   made perfect by charity; that is, by fulfilling of the law, and keeping
   the commandments of God: by sincere obedience and holiness of life,
   which, notwithstanding the unavoidable imperfection of it in this
   state, will nevertheless be accepted with God, through the merits of
   our blessed Saviour, "who hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in
   his own blood. To whom be glory for ever." Amen.

SERMON CX.

  THE DANGER OF ALL KNOWN SIN, BOTH FROM THE LIGHT OF NATURE AND REVELATION.

   For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
   and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
   because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God
   hath shewed it unto them.--Rom. i. 18, 19.

   IN the beginning of this chapter, the apostle declares that he was
   particularly designed and appointed by God to preach the gospel to the
   world, and that he was not ashamed of his ministry, not withstanding
   all the reproach and persecution it was attended withal, and
   notwithstanding the slight and undervaluing opinion which the world had
   of the doctrine which he preached, it being "to the Jews a
   stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness;" for though this might
   reflect some disparagement upon it in the esteem of sensual and carnal
   men, yet to those who weighed things impartially, and considered the
   excellent end and design of the Christian doctrine, and the force and
   efficacy of it to that end, it will appear to be an instrument
   admirably fitted, by the wisdom of God, for the reformation and
   salvation of mankind.

   And therefore he tells us, (ver. 16.) that how much soever it was
   despised by that ignorant and inconsiderate age, he was "not ashamed of
   the gospel of Christ;" because "it is the power of God unto salvation,
   to every one that believeth, to the Jew first; and also to the Greek:"
   that is, the doctrine of the gospel sincerely believed and embraced, is
   a most proper and powerful means, designed by God for the salvation of
   mankind; not only of the Jews, but also of the gentiles.

   The revelations which God had formerly made, were chiefly restrained to
   the Jewish nation; but this great and last revelation of the gospel,
   was equally calculated for the benefit and advantage of all mankind.
   The gospel, indeed, was first preached to the Jews, and from thence
   published to the whole world; and as this doctrine was designed for the
   general benefit of mankind, so it was very likely to be effectual to
   that end, being an instrument equally fitted for the salvation of the
   whole world, gentiles as well as Jews; "it is the power of God to
   salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the
   Greek."

   And to shew the efficacy of it, he instanceth in two things, which
   render it so powerful and effectual a means for the salvation of
   mankind.

   First, Because therein the grace and mercy of God, in the justification
   of a sinner, and declaring him righteous, is so clearly revealed, (ver.
   17.) "For therein is the righteousness of God revealed, from faith to
   faith, as it is written, the just shall live by faith." This is very
   obscurely expressed, but the meaning of this text will be very much
   cleared, by comparing it with another in the third chapter of this
   Epistle, (ver. 20, 21, 22, &c.) where the apostle speaks more fully and
   expressly of the way of our justification by ^he faith of Jesus Christ;
   that is, by the belief of the gospel. He asserts, at the 20th verse,
   that "by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in the
   sight of God." To this way of justification, "by the deeds of the law,"
   he opposeth "the righteousness of God by the faith of Jesus Christ, to
   all, and upon all them that believe," which is the gospel way of
   justification: (ver. 21, 22.) "But now the righteousness of God without
   the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets,
   even the righteousness of God, which is by the faith of Jesus Christ,
   unto all, and upon all them that believe." "The righteousness of God
   without the law is manifested;" that is, the way which God hath taken
   to justify sinners, and declare them righteous "without the deeds of
   the law;" that is, without observing the law of Moses, "is manifested;"
   that is, is clearly revealed in the gospel, (which is the same with
   what the apostle had said before, that the righteousness of God is
   revealed in the gospel) "being witnessed by the law and the prophets;"
   that is, "the righteousness of God," or the justification of sinners by
   Jesus Christ, is clearly revealed in the gospel, being also in a more
   obscure manner attested or foretold in the Old Testament, which he
   calls "the law and the prophets;" and this fully explains that
   difficult phrase of "the righteousness of God being revealed by the
   gospel, from faith to faith;" that is, by a gradual revelation, being
   more obscurely foretold in the Old Testament, and clearly discovered in
   the New; so that these two passages are equivalent: in the gospel, "the
   righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; and the
   righteousness of God without the works of the law is manifested, bring
   witnessed by the law and the prophets." There is the first and more
   imperfect revelation of it, but the clear revelation of it is in the
   gospel; this the apostle calls a revelation "from faith to faith;" that
   is, from a more imperfect and obscure, to a more express and clear,
   discovery and belief of it. And then the citation which follows is very
   pertinent, "as it is written, the just shall live by faith;" for this
   citation out of the Old Testament plainly shews, that the way of
   justification by faith was there mentioned; or, as our apostle
   expresseth it, was "witnessed by the law and the prophets;" and
   consequently, that this was a gradual discovery, which he calls a
   revelation "from faith to faith." "The just shall live by faith;" that
   is, good men shall be saved by their faith; shall be justified and
   esteemed righteous in the sight of God, and finally saved by their
   faith. And so the apostle in the fifth chapter of this Epistle, (ver.
   18.) calls our justification by the faith of the gospel, the
   justification of life, in opposition to condemnation and death, which
   very well explains that saying of the prophet, "the just shall live by
   faith." I have been the longer upon this, that I might give some light
   to a very difficult and obscure text.

   Secondly, The other instance, whereby the apostle proves the gospel to
   be so powerful a means for the recovery and salvation of men, is, that
   therein also the severity of God against impenitent sinners, as well as
   his grace and mercy in the justification of the penitent, is clearly
   revealed: (ver. 18.) "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven,
   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth
   in unrighteousness;" because that which may be known of God is
   manifested in them, for God hath shewn it unto them. The first, viz.
   the grace of God in our justification and the remission of sins past,
   is a most proper and powerful argument to en courage us to obedience
   for the future; nothing being more likely to reclaim men to their duly,
   than the assurance of indemnity for past crimes; and the other is one
   of the most effectual considerations in the world to deter men from
   sin, that "the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
   ungodliness and unrighteousness of men," &c.

   From which words I shall observe these six things:

   First, The infinite danger that a wicked and sinful course doth plainly
   expose men to. "The wrath of God" is here said to be "revealed against
   the impiety and unrighteousness of men."

   Secondly, The clear and undoubted revelation which the gospel hath made
   of this danger, "The wrath of God" against the sins of men is said to
   be "revealed from heaven."

   Thirdly, That every wicked and vicious practice doth expose men to this
   great danger. "The wrath of God is" said to be "revealed against all
   ungodliless and unrighteousness of men."

   Fourthly, That it is a very great aggravation of sin, for men to offend
   against the light of their own minds. The apostle here aggravates the
   impiety and wickedness of the heathen world, that they did not live up
   to the knowledge which they had of God, but contradicted it in their
   lives, which he calls "holding the truth in unrighteousness."

   Fifthly, The natural knowledge which men have of God, if they live
   wickedly, is a clear evidence of their "holding the truth in
   unrighteousness. The apostle therefore chargeth them with "holding the
   truth in unrighteousness," because that which may be known of God is
   manifested in them, God having shewed it to them.

   Sixthly and lastly, That the clear revelation of the wrath of God in
   the gospel, against the impiety and wickedness of men, renders it a
   very powerful and likely means for the recovery and salvation of men.
   For the apostle proves "the gospel of Christ" to be "the power of God
   to salvation;" because "therein the wrath of God is revealed from
   heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the
   truth in unrighteousness;" that is, against all impenitent sinners.

   I shall, at the present, by God's assistance, speak to the three first
   of these particulars.

   First, The infinite danger that a wicked and sinful course doth plainly
   expose men to. If there be a God that made the world, and governs it,
   and takes care of mankind, and hath given them laws and rules to live
   by, he cannot but be greatly displeased at the violation and
   transgression of them; and certainly the displeasure of God is the most
   dreadful thing in the world, and the effects of it the most
   insupportable. The greatest fear is from the greatest danger, and the
   greatest danger is from the greatest power offended and enraged; and
   this is a consideration exceeding full of terror, that by a sinful
   course we expose ourselves to the utmost displeasure of the great and
   terrible God; for "who knows the power of his wrath? and who may stand
   before him when once he is angry? According to thy fear, so is thy
   wrath," saith the psalmist. There is no passion in the mind of man that
   is more boundless and infinite than our fear; it is apt to make wild
   and frightful representations of evils, and to imagine them many times
   greater than really they are; but in this case our imagination must
   fall short of the truth and terror of the thing; for the wrath of God
   doth far exceed the utmost jealousy and suspicion of the most fearful
   and guilty conscience; and the greatest sinner under his greatest
   anguish and despair, cannot apprehend or fear it more than there is
   reason for; "according to thy fear, so is thy wrath."

   If it were only the wrath and displeasure of men that the sinner were
   exposed to, there might be reason enough for fear; because they have
   many times power enough to crush an offender, and cruelty enough to
   fret every vein of his body, and to torment him in every part: but the
   wrath and vengeance of men bears no comparison with the wrath of God.
   Their passions are many times strong and blustering; but their arm is
   but short, and their power small; they have not an arm like God, nor
   can they thunder with a voice like him. They may design considerable
   harm and mischief to us; but it is not always in the power of their
   hand to wreak their malice upon us, and to execute all the mischief
   which their enraged minds may prompt them to; the very utmost they can
   design is to torment our bodies, and to take away our lives; and when
   they have designed this, they may die first, and return to their dust,
   and then their thoughts perish with them, and all their malicious
   designs are at an end: they are always under the power and government
   of a superior Being, and can go no farther than he gives them leave.
   However, if they do their worst, and shoot all their arrows at us, we
   cannot stand at the mark long, their wrath will soon make an end of us,
   and set us free from all their cruelty and oppression; they can but
   "kill the body, and after that they have no more that they can do;"
   their most refined malice cannot reach our spirits, no weapon that can
   be formed by the utmost art of man can pierce and our souls; they can
   drive us out of this world, but they cannot pursue us into the other;
   so that at the worst the grave will be a sanctuary to us, and death a
   safe retreat from all their rage and fury.

   But the wrath of God is not confined by any of these limits. "Once hath
   God spoken, (saith David, by an elegant Hebrew phrase, to express the
   certainty of the thing) once hath God spoken, and twice I have heard
   this, that power belongs to God." (Psal. lxii. 11.) He hath a mighty
   arm, and when he pleaseth to stretch it out, none may stay it, nor say
   unto him, What dost thou?" he hath power enough to make good all his
   threatenings, whatever he says he is able to effect, and whatever he
   purposeth he can bring to pass: for "his counsel shall stand, and he
   will accomplish all his pleasure;" he need but speak the word, and it
   is done; for we can neither resist his power, nor fly from it: if we
   fly to the utmost parts of the earth, his hand can reach us; for "in
   his hands are all the corners of the earth: if we take refuge in the
   grave (and we cannot do that without his leave) thither his wrath can
   follow us; and there it will overtake us; for his power is not confined
   to this, world, nor limited to our bodies; "after he hath killed, he
   can destroy both body and soul in hell.

   And this is that "wrath of God which is revealed from heaven," and
   which the apostle chiefly intends; viz. the misery and punishment of
   another world. This God hath threatened sinners withal: to express
   which to us, as fully as words can do, he heaps up in the next chapter
   so many weighty and terrible words "indignation and wrath, tribulation
   and anguish, upon every soul of man that doth evil;" in opposition to
   that great and glorious reward of "immortality and eternal life," which
   is promised to a "patient continuance in well-doing."

   So that "the wrath of God," which is here denounced "against the
   impiety and unrighteousness of men," comprehends all the evils and
   miseries of this and the other world, which every sinner is in danger
   of whilst he continues impenitent; for as, according to the tenor of
   the gospel, "godliness hath the promise of this life, and of that which
   is to come;" so impotency in sin exposeth men to the evils of both
   worlds; to the judgments of "the life that now is," and to the endless
   and intolerable torments "of that which is to come." And what can be
   more dreadful than the displeasure of an almighty and eternal Being?
   who can punish to the utmost, and who lives for ever, to execute his
   wrath and vengeance upon sinners; so that well might the apostle say,
   "it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."

   "Consider this all ye that forget God," that neglect him, and live in
   continual disobedience to his holy and righteous laws; much more those
   who despise and affront him, and live in a perpetual defiance of him.
   "Will ye provoke the Lord to jealousy? are ye stronger than he?" Think
   of it seriously, and forget him if you can, despise him if you dare;
   consider this, lest he take you into consideration, and rouse like a
   lion out of sleep, and "tear you in pieces, and there be none to
   deliver." This is the first observation; the infinite danger that a
   wicked and sinful course doth expose men to, the wrath of God, which
   doth not only signify more than all the evils that we know, but than
   all those which the wildest fears and suspicions of our minds can
   image.

   Secondly, The next thing observable, is the clear and undoubted
   revelation which the gospel hath made of this danger, "the wrath of God
   is revealed," &c. By which the apostle intimates to us, that this was
   but obscurely known to the world before, at least in comparison of that
   clear discovery which the gospel hath now made of it; so that I may
   allude to that expression in Job, which he applies to death and the
   grave, that "hell is naked before us, and destruction hath no
   covering."

   Not but that mankind had always apprehensions and jealousies of the
   danger of a wicked life, and sinners were always afraid of the
   vengeance of God pursuing their evil deeds, not only in this life, but
   after it too; and though they had turned the punishments of another
   world into ridiculous fables, yet the wiser sort of mankind could not
   get it out of their minds, that there was something real under them;
   and that Ixion's wheel, which by a perpetual motion carried him about;
   and Sisyphus's stone, which he was perpetually rolling up the hill, and
   when he had got it near the top tumbled down, and still created him a
   new labour; and Tantalus's continual hunger and thirst, aggravated by a
   perpetual nearness of enjoyment, and a perpetual disappointment; and
   Prometheus's being chained to a rock, with an eagle or vulture
   perpetually preying upon his liver, which grew as fast as it was
   gnawed: I say, even the wiser among the heathens looked upon these as
   fantastical representations of some thing that was real; viz. the
   grievous and endless punishment of sinners, the not to be endured, and
   yet perpetually renewed torments of another world; for in the midst of
   all the ignorance and degeneracy of the heathen world, men's
   consciences did accuse them when they did amiss, and they had secret
   fears and misgivings of some mighty danger hanging over them from the
   displeasure of a superior Being, and the apprehension of some great
   mischiefs likely to follow their wicked actions, which some time or
   other would overtake them; which, because they did not always in this
   world, they dreaded them in the next. And this was the foundation of
   all those superstitions whereby the ancient pagans endeavoured so
   carefully to appease their offended deities, and to avert the
   calamities which they feared they would send down upon them. But all
   this while they had no certain assurance by any clear and express
   revelation from God to that purpose, but only the jealousies and
   suspicions of their own minds, naturally consequent upon those notions
   which men generally had of God, but so obscured and depraved by the
   lusts and vices of men, and by the gross and false conceptions which
   they had of God, that they only served to make them superstitious, but
   were not clear and strong enough to make them wisely and seriously
   religious. And, to speak the truth, the more knowing and inquisitive
   part of the heathen world had brought all these things into great doubt
   and uncertainty, by the nicety and subtlety of disputes about them; so
   that it was no great wonder that these principles had no greater effect
   upon the lives of men, when their apprehensions of them were so dark
   and doubtful.

   But the gospel hath made a most clear and certain revelation of these
   things to mankind. It was written before upon men's hearts as the great
   sanction of the law of nature; but the impressions of this were in a
   great measure blurred and worn out, so hat it had no great power and
   efficacy upon the minds and manners of men; but now it is clearly
   discovered to us, "the wrath of God is revealed from heaven," which
   expression may well imply in it these three things:

   First, The clearness of the discovery; "the wrath of God" is said to be
   "revealed."

   Secondly, The extraordinary manner of it; it is said to be "revealed
   from heaven."

   Thirdly, The certainty of it; not being the result of subtle and
   doubtful reasonings, but having a Divine testimony and confirmation
   given to it, which is the proper meaning of being "revealed from
   heaven."

   First, It imports the clearness of the discovery. The punishment of
   sinners in another world is not so obscure a matter as it was before:
   it is now expressly declared in the gospel, together with the
   particular circumstances of it; namely, that there is another life
   after this, wherein men shall receive the just recompense of reward for
   all the actions done by them in this life; that there is a particular
   time appointed, wherein God will call all the world to a solemn
   account, and those who are in their graves shall, by a powerful voice,
   be raised to life, and those who shall then be found alive shall be
   suddenly changed; when our Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal and
   only-begotten Son of God, who once came in great humility to save us,
   shall come again "in power and great glory," attended with "his mighty
   angels; and all nations shall be gathered before him," and all mankind
   shall be separated into two companies, the righteous and the wicked,
   who, after a full hearing and fair trial, shall be sentenced, according
   to their actions; the one to eternal life and happiness, the other to
   everlasting misery and torment.

   So that the gospel hath not only declared the thing to us, that there
   shall be a future judgment; but for our farther assurance and
   satisfaction in this matter, and that these things might make a deep
   impression, and strike a great awe upon our minds, God hath been
   pleased to reveal it to us with a great many particular circumstances,
   such as are very worthy of God, and apt to fill the minds of men with
   dread and astonishment, as often as they think of them.

   For the circumstances of this judgment revealed to us in the gospel are
   very solemn and awful; not such as the wild fancies and imaginations of
   men would have been apt to have dressed it up withal, such as are the
   fictions of the heathen poets, and the extravagances of Mahomet; which,
   though they be terrible enough, yet they are withal ridiculous; but
   such as are every way becoming the majesty of the great God, and the
   solemnity of the great day, and such as do not in the least savour of
   the vanity and lightness of human imagination.

   For what more fair and equal, than that men should be tried by a man
   like themselves, one of the same rank and condition, that had
   experience of the infirmities and temptations of human nature? So our
   Lord tells us, that "the Father hath committed all judgment to the
   Son," because he is the Son of man; and therefore cannot be excepted
   against, as not being a fit and equal judge. And this St. Paul offers
   us a clear proof of the equitable proceedings of that day: "God (says
   he) hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in
   righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained."

   And then what more congruous than that the Son of God, who had taken so
   much pains for the salvation of men, and came into the world for that
   purpose, and had used all imaginable means for the reformation of
   mankind; I say, what more congruous, than that this very person should
   be honoured by God to sit in judgment upon the world, and to condemn
   those who, after all the means that had been tried for their recovery,
   would not repent and be saved. And, what more proper, than that men,
   who are to be judged for "things done in the body," should be judged in
   the body; and consequently that the resurrection of the dead should
   precede the general judgment.

   And what more magnificent and suitable to this glorious solemnity, than
   the awful circumstances which the Scripture mentions of the appearance
   of this great Judge; that he shall "descend from heaven," in great
   majesty and glory, attended with "his mighty angels, "and that "every
   eye shall see him; that, upon his appearance, the frame of nature shall
   be in an agony, and the whole world in flame and confusion; that those
   great and glorious bodies of light shall be obscured, and by degrees
   extinguished: "The sun shall be darkened, and the moon turned into
   blood, and all the powers of heaven shaken;" yea, "the heavens
   themselves shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
   dissolve with fervent heat; the earth also, and all the works that are
   therein, shall be burnt up." I appeal to any man, whether this be not a
   representation of things very proper and suitable to that great day,
   wherein He who made the world shall come to judge it? and whether the
   wit of man ever devised any thing so awful and so agreeable to the
   majesty of God, and the solemn judgment of the whole world? The
   description which Virgil makes of the judgment of another world, of the
   Elysian fields, and the infernal regions, how infinitely do they fall
   short of the majesty of the Holy Scripture, and the description there
   made of heaven and hell, and of" the great and terrible day of the
   Lord!" so that in comparison they are childish and trifling; and yet,
   perhaps, he had the most regular and most governed imagination of any
   man that ever lived, and. observed the greatest decorum in his
   characters and descriptions. But who can declare the great things of
   God, but he to whom God shall reveal them!

   Secondly, This expression of "the wrath of God" being "revealed from
   heaven," doth not only imply the clear discovery of the thing, but
   likewise some thing extraordinary in the manner of the discovery. It is
   not only a natural impression upon the minds of men, that God will
   severely punish sinners; but he hath taken care that mankind should be
   instructed in this matter in a very particular and extraordinary
   manner. He hath not left it to the reason of men to collect it from the
   consideration of his attributes and perfections, his holiness and
   justice, and from the consideration of the promiscuous administration
   of his providence towards good and bad men in this world; but he hath
   been pleased to stud an extraordinary person from heaven, on purpose to
   declare this thing plainly to the world: "The wrath of God is revealed
   from heaven;" that is, God sent his own Son from heaven, on purpose to
   declare his wrath against all obstinate and impenitent sinners, that he
   might effectually awaken the drowsy world to repentance; he hath sent
   an extraordinary ambassador into the world, to give warning to all
   those who continue in their sins, of the judgment of the great day, and
   to summon them before his dreadful tribunal. So the apostle tells the
   Athenians, (Acts xvii. 30, 31.) "Now he commandeth all men every where
   to repent; because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the
   world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he
   hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the
   dead."

   Thirdly, This expression implies likewise the certainty of this
   discovery. If the wrath of God had only been declared in the discourses
   of wise men, though grounded upon very probable reason, yet it might
   have been brought into doubt by the contrary reasonings of subtle and
   disputing men: but, to put the matter out of all question, we have a
   Divine testimony for it, and God hath confirmed it from heaven, by
   signs, and wonders, and miracles, especially by the resurrection of
   Jesus Christ from the dead; for "by this he hath given assurance unto
   all men, that it is he who is ordained of God to judge the quick and
   dead."

   Thus you see in what respect "the wrath of God" is said to be "revealed
   from heaven;" in that the gospel hath made a more clear, and
   particular, and certain discovery of the judgment of the great day than
   ever was made to the world before. I proceed to the

   Third observation, which I shall speak but briefly to; namely, That
   every wicked and vicious practice doth expose men to this dreadful
   danger. The apostle instanceth in the two chief heads to which the sins
   of men may be reduced, impiety to wards God, and unrighteousness
   towards men; and therefore he is to be understood to denounce the wrath
   of God against every particular kind of sin, comprehended under these
   general heads; so that no man that allows himself in any impiety and
   wickedness of life can hope to escape the wrath of God. Therefore it
   concerns us to be entirely religions, and to have respect to all God's
   commandments; and to take heed that we do not allow ourselves in the
   practice of any kind of sin whatsoever, because the living in any one
   known sin is enough to expose us to the dreadful wrath of God. Though a
   man be just and righteous in his dealings with men, yet if he neglect
   the worship and service of God, this will certainly bring him under
   condemnation: and, on the other hand, though a man may serve God never
   so diligently and devoutly, yet if he be defective in righteousness
   towards men, if he deal falsely and fraudulently with his neighbour, he
   shall not escape the wrath of God; though a man pretend to never so
   much piety and devotion, yet if he be unrighteous, "he shall not
   inherit the kingdom of God;" if any man "overreach and defraud his
   brother in any matter, the Lord is the avenger of such," saith St.
   Paul. (I Thess. iv. 6.)

   So that here is a very powerful argument to take men off from all sin,
   and to engage them to a constant and careful discharge of their whole
   duty to ward God and men, and to reform whatever is amiss cither in the
   frame and temper of their minds, or in the actions and course of their
   lives; because any kind of wickedness, any one sort of vicious course,
   lays men open to the vengeance of God, and the punishments of another
   world; "the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
   ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men;" there is no exception in the
   case, we must forsake all sin, subdue every lust, "be holy in all
   manner of conversation," otherwise we can have no reasonable hopes of
   escaping the wrath of God, and the damnation of hell. But I proceed to
   the

   Fourth observation; namely, That it is a very great aggravation of sin,
   for men to offend against the light of their own minds. The apostle
   here aggravates the wickedness of the heathen world, that they did not
   live up to that knowledge which they had of God, but contradicted it in
   their lives, "holding the truth of God in unrighteousness." And that he
   speaks here of the heathen, is plain from his following discourse, and
   the character he gives of those persons of whom he was speaking, "who
   hold the truth of God in unrighteousness; because that which may be
   known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shewn it unto them;" and
   this he proves, because those who were destitute of Divine revelation,
   were not without all knowledge of God, being led by the sight of this
   visible world, to the knowledge of an invisible Being and power that
   was the author of it: (ver. 20, 21.) "For the invisible things of him
   from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by
   the things which are made, even his eternal power and godhead, so that
   they are without excuse; because that, when they knew God, they
   glorified him not as God, (Haec est summa delicti, nolle agnoscere,
   quem ignorare non possis, saith Tertullian to the heathen; This is the
   height of thy fault, not to acknowledge him, whom thou canst not but
   know, not to own him, of whom thou canst not be ignorant if thou
   wouldst;') neither were thankful;" they did not pay those
   acknowledgments to him which of right were due to the author of their
   being, and of all good things; but became vain in their imaginations;
   emataiothesan en tois dialogismois auton, they were fooled with their
   own reasonings. This he speaks of the philosophers, who in those great
   arguments of the being and providence of God, the immortality of the
   soul, and the rewards of another world, had lost the truth by too much
   subtilty about it, and had disputed themselves into doubt and
   uncertainty about those things which were naturally known; for nimium
   altercando veritas amittitur; "Truth is many times lost by too much
   contention and dispute about it; and, by too eager a pursuit of it, men
   many times outrun it, and leave it behind;" (ver. 22.) "and professing
   themselves to be wise, they became fools." Men never play the fools
   more, than by endeavouring to be over-subtle and wise; (ver. 23.) "and
   changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to
   corruptible man, and to birds, and to four-footed beasts, and creeping
   things;" here he speaks of the sottishness of their idolatry, whereby
   they provoked God to give them up to all manner of lewdness and
   impurity; (ver. 24.) "wherefore God also gave them up unto uncleanness,
   through the lusts of their own hearts;" and again, (ver. 26.) "for this
   cause God gave them up to vile affections;" and then he enumerates the
   abominable lusts and vices they were guilty of, notwithstanding their
   natural acknowledgment of the Divine justice; (ver. 32.) "who, knowing
   the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of
   death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
   By all which it appears that he speaks of the heathen, who offended
   against the natural light of their own minds, and therefore were
   without excuse. Quam sibi veniam sperare possunt impietatis suae, qui
   non agnoscunt cultum ejus, quem prorsus ignorari ab hominibus fas non
   est? saith Lactantius; "How can they hope for pardon of their impiety,
   who deny to worship that God, of whom it is not possible mankind should
   be wholly ignorant?"

   So that this is "to hold the truth in unrighteousness," injuriously to
   suppress it, and to hinder the power and efficacy of it upon their
   minds and actions; for so the word kate'chein sometimes signifies, as
   well as to hold fast; and this every man does, who acts contrary to
   what he believes and knows; he offers violence to the light of his own
   mind, and does injury to the truth, and keeps that a prisoner which
   would set him free; "ye shall know the truth (says our Lord), and the
   truth shall make you free."

   And this is one of the highest aggravations of the sins of men, to
   offend against knowledge, and that light which God hath set up in every
   man's mind. If men wander and stumble in the dark, it is not to be
   wondered at; many times it is unavoidable, and no care can prevent it:
   but in the light it is expected men should look before them, and
   discern their way. That natural light which the heathens had, though it
   was but comparatively dim and imperfect, yet the apostle takes notice
   of it as a great aggravation of their idolatrous and abominable
   practices. Those natural notions which all men have of God, if they had
   in any measure attended to them, and governed themselves by them, might
   have been sufficient to have preserved them from dishonouring the
   Deity, by worshipping creatures instead of God; the common light of
   nature was enough to have discovered to them the evil of those lewd and
   unnatural practices, which many of them were guilty of; but they
   detained and suppressed the truth most injuriously, and would not
   suffer it to have its natural and proper influence upon them; and this
   is that which left them without excuse, that from the light of nature
   they had knowledge enough to have done better and to have preserved
   them from those great crimes which were so common among them.

   And if this was so great an aggravation of the impiety and wickedness
   of the heathen, and left them without excuse, what apology can be made
   for the impiety and unrighteousness of Christians, who have so strong
   and clear alight to discover to them their duty, and the danger of
   neglecting it, to whom the "wrath of God" is plainly "revealed from
   heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men?" The truths
   of the gospel are so very clear and powerful, and such an improvement
   of natural light, that men must use great force and violence to
   suppress them, and to hinder the efficacy of them upon their lives. And
   this is a certain rule, by how much the greater our knowledge, by so
   much the less is our excuse, and so much the greater punishment is due
   to our faults. So our Lord hath told us, (Luke xii. 47.) "That servant
   which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did
   according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes." And, (John
   ix. 41.) "If ye were blind (says our Saviour to the Jews) ye should
   have no sin." So much ignorance as there is of our duty, so much
   abatement of the wilfulness of our faults; but "if we sin wilfully,
   after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no
   more sacrifice for sin, but a fearful expectation of judgment and fiery
   indignation," says the apostle to the Hebrews; (chap. x. 26, 27.) "If
   we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth;
   implying, that men cannot pretend ignorance for their faults, after so
   clear a revelation of the will of God, as is made to mankind by the
   gospel.

   And upon this consideration it is, that our Saviour doth so aggravate
   the impenitency and unbelief of the Jews, because it was in opposition
   to all the advantages of knowledge, which can be imagined to be
   afforded to mankind. (John xv. 22-24.) "If I had not come and spoken
   unto them, they had not had sin;" that is, in comparison their sin had
   been much more excusable; "but now they have no cloak for their sin. He
   that hateth me, hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the
   works which none other man did, they had not had sin; but now have they
   both seen and hated both me and my Father." How is that? our Saviour
   means, that they had now sinned against all the advantages of knowing
   the will of God that mankind could possibly have: at once opposing
   natural light, which was the dispensation of the Father; and the
   clearest revelation of God's will, in the dispensation of the gospel by
   his Son; "now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father."

   The two remaining observations I shall reserve to another opportunity.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXI.

  THE DANGER OF ALL KNOWN SIN, BOTH FROM THE LIGHT OF NATURE AND REVELATION.

   For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
   and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
   because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God
   hath shewed it unto them.--Rom. i. 18, 19.

   I HAVE handled four of the observations which I raised from these
   words; and shall now proceed to the other two that remain.

   The fifth observation was, That the natural knowledge which men have of
   God, if they live contrary to it, is a sufficient evidence of their
   holding the truth of God in unrighteousness. For the reason why the
   apostle chargeth them with this, is, "Because that which may be known
   of God is manifest, in that God hath shewed it unto them."

   There is a natural knowledge of God, and of the duty we owe to him,
   which the apostle calls to gnoston tou Theou, that of God which is
   obvious to be known by the light of nature, and is as much as is
   absolutely necessary for us to know. There is something of God that is
   incomprehensible, and be yond the reach of our understandings; but his
   being and essential perfections may be known, which he calls his
   "eternal power and godhead;" these, he tells us, "are clearly seen,
   being under stood by the things which are made;" that is, the creation
   of the world is a plain demonstration to men, of the being and power of
   God; and if so, then God is naturally known to men; the contrary
   whereof Socinus positively maintains, though therein he be forsaken by
   most of his followers; an opinion in my judgment very unworthy of one,
   who, not without reason, was esteemed so great a master of reason; and
   (though I believe he did not see it) undermining the strongest and
   surest foundation of all religion, which, when the natural notions of
   God are once taken away, will certainly want its best support. Besides
   that, by denying any natural knowledge of God, and his essential
   perfections, he freely gives away one of the most plausible grounds of
   opposing the doctrine of the Trinity. But because this is a matter of
   great consequence, and he was a great man, and is not to be confuted by
   contempt, but by better reason, if it can be found; I will consider his
   reasons for this opinion, and return a particular answer to them.

   First, He says, that if the knowledge of God were natural, it would not
   be of faith; but the apostle says, that "we must believe that he is."
   The force of which argument, if it have any, lies in this, that the
   object of faith is Divine revelation, and therefore we cannot be said
   to believe what we naturally know. The schoolmen indeed say so; but the
   Scripture useth the word faith more largely, for a real persuasion of
   any thing, whether grounded upon sense, or reason, or Divine
   revelation. And our Saviour's speech to Thomas, "Because thou hast
   seen, thou hast believed," does sufficiently intimate, that a man may
   believe what he sees; and if so, what should hinder, but that a man may
   be said to believe what he naturally knows; that is, be really
   persuaded that there is a God from natural light?

   Secondly, His next argument is, because the same apostle concludes
   Enoch to have believed God, because he pleased God, and without faith
   it is impossible to please him; from whence he says, it is certain that
   men may be without this belief, which if it be natural they cannot.
   Indeed, if the apostle had said, that whoever believes a God, must of
   necessity obey and please him; then the inference had been good, that
   all men do not naturally believe a God, because it is certain they do
   not please him: but it is not good the other way, no more than if a man
   should argue thus--that because whoever acts reasonably must be endowed
   with reason, therefore men are not naturally endowed with reason. For
   as men may naturally be endowed with reason, and yet not always make
   use of it; so men may naturally know and believe a God, and yet not be
   careful to please him.

   His third argument is, That the Scripture says, that there are some
   that do not believe a God, for which he cites that of David, "the fool
   hath said in his heart there is no God;" which certainly proves that
   bad men live so, as if they believed there were no God; nay, it may
   farther import, that they endeavour as much as they can to stifle and
   extinguish the belief of a God in their minds, and would gladly
   persuade themselves there is no God, because it is convenient for them
   there should be none; and whether David meant so or not, it is very
   probable that some may arrive to that height of impiety, as for a time
   at least, and in some moods, to disbelieve a God, and to be very
   confident of the arguments on that side. But what then? Is the
   knowledge and belief of a God therefore not natural to mankind? Nature
   itself, as constant and uniform as it is, admits of some irregularities
   and exceptions, in effects that are merely natural, much more in those
   which have something in them that is voluntary, and depends upon the
   good or bad use of our reason and understanding; and there is no
   arguing from what is monstrous, against what is natural. It is natural
   for men to have five fingers upon a hand, and yet some are born
   otherwise: but in voluntary agents, that which is natural may be
   perverted, and in a great measure extinguished in some particular
   instances; so that there is no force at all in this objection.

   His fourth and last argument is, That there have not only been
   particular persons, but whole nations, who have had no sense, nor so
   much as suspicion of a Deity. This I confess were of great force, if it
   were true; and for the proof of this, he produceth the instance of
   Brasil in America. But I utterly deny the matter of fact and history,
   and challenge any man to bring good testimony, not only of any nation,
   but of any city in the world, that ever were professed Atheists.

   I know this was affirmed of some part of Brasil, by some of the first
   discoverers; who yet at the same time owned, that these very people did
   most expressly believe the immortality of the soul, and the rewards and
   punishments of another life; opinions which no man can well reconcile
   with the denial and disbelief of a Deity. But, to put an end to this
   argument, later and more perfect discoveries have found this not to be
   true, and do assure us, upon better acquaintance with those barbarous
   people, that they are deeply possessed with the belief of "one supreme
   God, who made and governs the world."

   Having thus given a particular answer to Socinus's arguments against
   the natural knowledge of a God, I will now briefly offer some arguments
   for it. And to prove that the knowledge and belief of a God is natural
   to mankind, my

   First argument shall be from the universal consent, in this matter, of
   all nations in all ages. And this is an argument of great force; there
   being no better way to prove any thing to be natural to any kind of
   being, than if it be generally found in the whole kind. Omnium
   consensus naturae vox est, "the consent of all is the voice of nature,"
   saith Tully. And, indeed, by what other argument can we prove that
   reason, and speech, and an inclination to society, are natural to men;
   but that these belong to the whole kind?

   Secondly, Unless the knowledge of God and his essential perfections be
   natural, I do not see what sufficient and certain foundation there can
   be of revealed religion. For unless we naturally know God to be a being
   of all perfection, and consequently that whatever he says is true, I
   cannot see what Divine revelation can signify. For God's revealing or
   declaring such a thing to us, is no necessary argument that it is so,
   unless antecedently to this revelation we be possessed firmly with this
   principle that whatever God says is true. And whatever is known
   antecedently to revelation, must be known by natural light, and by
   reasonings and deductions from natural principles. I might farther add
   to this argument, that the only standard and measure to judge of Divine
   revelations, and to distinguish between what are true and what are
   counterfeit, are the natural notions which men have of God, and of his
   essential perfections.

   Thirdly, If the notion of a God be not natural, I do not see how men
   can have any natural notion of the difference of moral good and evil,
   just and unjust. For if I do not naturally know there is a God, how can
   I naturally know that there is any law obliging to the one, and
   forbidding the other? All law and obligation to obedience necessarily
   supposing the authority of a superior Being. But the apostle expressly
   asserts, that the gentiles, who were destitute of a revealed law, "were
   a law unto themselves;" but there cannot be a natural law obliging
   mankind, unless God be naturally known to them.

   And this, Socinus himself, in his discourse upon this very argument, is
   forced to acknowledge. "In all men (says he) there is naturally a
   difference of just and unjust, or, at least, there is planted in all
   men an acknowledgment that just ought to be preferred before unjust,
   and that which is honest, before the contrary; and this is nothing else
   but the word of God within a man, which whosoever obeys, in so doing
   obeys God, though otherwise he neither know nor think there is a God;
   and there is no doubt but he that thus obeys God is accepted of him."
   So that here is an acknowledgment of a natural obligation to a law,
   without any natural knowledge of a superior authority; which I think
   cannot be; and which is worse, that a man may obey God acceptably,
   without knowing and believing there is a God; which directly thwarts
   the ground of his first argument, from those words of the
   apostle,--"without faith it is impossible to please God; for he that
   cometh to God," that is, he that will be religious and please God,
   "must believe that he is:" so hard is it for any man to contradict
   nature, without contradicting himself.

   Fourthly, My last argument I ground upon the words of the apostle in my
   text, "that which may be known of God, is manifest in them; for God
   hath shewed it unto them." "Is manifest in them," en autois, among
   them. God hath sufficiently manifested it to mankind. And which way
   hath God done this? by revelation^ or by the natural light of reason?
   He tells us at the 20th verse: "For the invisible things of him from
   the creation of the world are clearly seen;" that is, God, who in
   himself is invisible, ever since he hath created the world, hath given
   a visible demonstration of himself, that is, of "his eternal power and
   godhead; being understood by the things which are made." The plain
   sense of the whole is, that this wise and wonderful frame of the world,
   which cannot reasonably be ascribed to any other cause but God, is a
   sensible demonstration, to all mankind, of an eternal and powerful
   Being that was the author and framer of it. The only question now is,
   whether this text speaks of the knowledge of God by particular
   revelation, or by natural light and reason, from the contemplation of
   the works of God: Socinus having no other way to avoid the force of
   this text, will needs understand it of the knowledge of God by the
   revelation of the gospel. His words are these:" The apostle therefore
   says, in this place, that the eternal godhead of God, that is, that
   which God would always have us to do (for the godhead is sometimes
   taken in this sense), and his eternal power, that is, his promise which
   never fails (in which sense he said a little before that the gospel is
   the power of God), these, I say, which were never seen by men; that is,
   were never known to them since the creation of the world, are known by
   his works; that is, by the wonderful operation of God, and Divine men,
   especially of Christ and his apostles." These are his very words; and
   now I refer it to any indifferent judgment, whether this be not a very
   forced and constrained interpretation of this text; and whether that
   which I have before given, be not infinitely more free and natural, and
   every way more agreeable to the obvious sense of the words, and the
   scope of the apostle's argument. For he plainly speaks of the heathen,
   and proves them to be inexcusable, because "they held the truth in
   unrighteousness;" and having a natural knowledge of God, from the
   contemplation of his works, and the things which are made, "they did
   not glorify him as God." And therefore I shall not trouble myself to
   give any other answer to it; for, by the absurd violence of it in every
   part, it confutes itself more effectually than any discourse about it
   can do.

   I have been the larger upon this, because it is a matter of so great
   consequence, and lies at the bottom of all religion. For the natural
   knowledge which men have of God is, when all is done, the surest and
   fastest hold that religion hath on human nature. Besides, how should
   God judge that part of the world who are wholly destitute of Divine
   revelation, if they had no natural knowledge of him, and consequently
   could not be under the direction and government of any law? For "where
   there is no law, there is no transgression;" and where men are guilty
   of the breach of no law, they cannot be judged and condemned for it;
   for "the judgment of God is according to truth."

   And now this being established, that men have a natural knowledge of
   God; if they contradict it by their life and practice, they are guilty
   of "retaining the truth of God in unrighteousness." For by this
   argument the apostle proves the heathen to be guilty of "holding the
   truth in unrighteousness;" because, notwithstanding the natural
   knowledge which they had of God "by the things which are made," they
   lived in the practice of gross idolatry, and the most abominable sins
   and vices.

   And this concerns us much more, who have the glorious light of the
   gospel added to the light of nature. For if they who offended against
   the light of nature, were liable to the judgment of God, of how much
   sorer punishment shall we be thought worthy, if we neglect those
   infinite advantages which the revelation of the gospel hath superadded
   to natural light? He hath now set our duty in the clearest and
   strongest light that ever was afforded to mankind, so that if we will
   not now believe and repent, there is no remedy for us, but we must "die
   in our sins; if we sin wilfully, after" so much "knowledge of the
   truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sin, but a fearful
   looking-for of judgment, and fiery indignation to consume us."

   The sum of what hath been said on this argument is briefly this; that
   men have a natural knowledge of God, and of those great duties which
   result from the knowledge of him; so that whatever men say and pretend,
   as to the main things of religion, the worship of God, and justice and
   righteousness to wards men, setting aside Divine revelation, we are all
   naturally convinced of our duty, and of what we ought to do; and them
   who live in a bad course, need only be put in mind of what they
   naturally know, better than any body else can tell them, that they are
   in a bad course; so that I may appeal to all wicked men, from
   themselves, rash, and heated, and intoxicated with pleasure and vanity,
   trans ported and hurried away by lust and passion; to themselves,
   serious and composed, and in a cool and considerate temper. And can any
   sober man forbear to follow the convictions of his own mind, and to
   resolve to do what he inwardly consents to as best? Let us but be true
   to ourselves, and obey the dictates of our own minds, and give leave to
   our own consciences to counsel us, and tell us what we ought to do, and
   we shall be "a law to ourselves." I proceed to the

   Sixth and last observation; namely, That the clear revelation of the
   wrath of God in the gospel, against the impiety and unrighteousness of
   men, is one principal thing, which renders it so very powerful and
   likely a means for the salvation of mankind. For the apostle instanceth
   in two things, which give the gospel so great an advantage to this
   purpose, the mercy of God to penitent sinners, and his severity toward
   the impenitent; both which are so fully and clearly revealed in the
   gospel. "The gospel is the power of God to salvation, to every one that
   believeth, because therein the righteousness of God is revealed;" that
   is, his great grace and mercy in the justification and pardon of
   sinners by Jesus Christ, which I have already shewn to be meant by "the
   righteousness of God," by comparing this with the explication which is
   given of "the righteousness of God," (chap. iii. ver. 22.)

   The other reason which he gives of the gospel's being "the power of God
   to salvation," is the plain declaration of the severity of God toward
   impenitent sinners; "because therein," also, "the wrath of God is
   revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men." The force of which argument will appear, if we consider these
   following particulars:

   First, That the declarations of the gospel in this matter are so plain
   and express.

   Secondly, That they are very dreadful and terrible.

   Thirdly, That there is no safety or hope of impunity for men that go on
   and continue in their sins.

   Fourthly, That this argument will take hold of the most desperate and
   profligate sinners, and still retain its force upon the minds of men,
   when all other considerations fail, and are of little or no efficacy.
   And,

   Fifthly, That no religion in the world can urge this argument with that
   force and advantage that Christianity does.

   First, That the declarations of the gospel in this matter are most
   plain and express; and that not only against sin and wickedness in
   general, but against particular sins and vices; so that no man that
   lives in any evil and vicious course, can be ignorant of his danger.
   Our Lord hath told us in general, what shall be the doom of the workers
   of iniquity, yea, though they may have owned him, and made profession
   of his name: (Matt. vii. 21.) "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
   Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the
   will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say unto me in that
   day, Lord, Lord, &c. then will I profess unto them, I never knew you,
   depart, from me ye that work iniquity." (Matt. xiii. 49, 50.) "So shall
   it be at the end of the world; the angels shall come forth, and sever
   the wicked from among the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of
   fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth." (Matt. xxv. 46.)
   "The wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the
   righteous into life eternal." (John v. 28, 29.) "The hour is coming, in
   which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come
   forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and
   they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." Rom. ii.
   6, St. Paul tells us that there is "a day of wrath, and of the
   revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to every
   man according to his deeds; to them who obey not the truth, but obey
   unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish upon
   every soul of man that doeth evil." 2 Thess. i. 7, 8, 9, that "the Lord
   Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels in flaming
   fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the
   gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall be punished with everlasting
   destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his
   power." Nothing can be more plain and express than these general
   declarations of the wrath of God against sinners; that there is a day
   of judgment appointed, and a judge constituted to take cognizance of
   the actions of men, to pass a severe sentence, and to inflict a
   terrible punishment, upon the workers of iniquity.

   More particularly our Lord and his apostles have denounced the wrath of
   God against particular sins and vices. In several places of the New
   Testament, there are catalogues given of particular sins; the practice
   whereof will certainly shut men out of the kingdom of heaven, and
   expose them to the wrath and vengeance of God. (1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.)
   "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
   Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
   nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves,
   nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall
   inherit the kingdom of God." So likewise, (Gal. v. 19-21.) "The works
   of the flesh are manifest, which are these, adultery, fornication,
   witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
   heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of
   the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in times past,
   that they that do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
   (Col. iii. 5, 6.) "Mortify therefore your members upon earth;
   fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and
   covetousness, which is idolatry; for which things sake the wrath of God
   cometh on the children of disobedience/ (Rev. xxi. 8.) "The fearful and
   unbelieving, (that is, those who rejected the Christian religion,
   notwithstanding the clear evidence that was offered for it, and those
   who out of fear should apostatize from it;) the fearful and
   unbelieving, and the abominable, (that is, those who were guilty of
   unnatural lusts, not fit to be named) and murderers, and whoremongers,
   and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars (that is, all sorts of
   false and deceitful and perfidious persons), shall have their part in
   the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second
   death.

   And not only these gross and notorious sins, which are such plain
   violations of tin? law and light of nature; but those wherein mankind
   have been apt to take more liberty, as if they were not sufficiently
   convinced of the evil of them; as, the resisting of civil authority,
   which the apostle tells us, they that are guilty of "shall receive to
   themselves damnation:" (Rom. xiii. 2.) profane swearing in common
   conversation, which, St. James tells us, brings men under the danger of
   damnation, (chap. v. 12.) "Above all things, my brethren, swear not,
   lest ye fall under condemnation." Nay, our Saviour hath told us
   plainly, that not only for wicked actions, but for every evil and
   sinful word, men are obnoxious to the judgment of God. So our Lord
   assures us; (Matt. xii. 36, 37.) "I say unto you, that every idle word
   that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of
   judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
   thou shalt be condemned." He had spoken before of that great and
   unpardonable sin of blaspheming the Holy Ghost; and because this might
   be thought great severity for evil words, he declares the reason more
   fully, because words shew the mind and temper of the man: (ver. 34.)
   "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." "The
   character of the man is shewn by his words," saith Menander. Profert
   enim mores plerumque oratio (saith Quintilian) et animi secreta
   detegit; "A man's speech discovers his manners, and the secrets of his
   heart;" ut vivit etiam quemque dicere, "Men commonly speak as they
   live;" and therefore our Saviour adds, "A good man, out of the good
   treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things; and an evil man, out
   of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth evil things: but I
   say unto you, that every idle word," pan rema argo`n, by which I do not
   think our Saviour means, that men should be called to a solemn account
   at the day of judgment, for every trifling, and impertinent, and
   unprofitable word, but every wicked and sinful word of any kind: as if
   he had said, Do yon think this severe, to make words an unpardonable
   fault? I say unto yon, that men shall not only be condemned for their
   malicious and blasphemous speeches against the Holy Ghost; but they
   shall likewise give a strict account for all other wicked and sinful
   speeches in any kind, though much inferior to this. And this is not
   only most agreeable to the scope of our Saviour, but is confirmed by
   some Greek copies, in which it is pan rema ponero`n, "every wicked word
   which men shall speak, they shall be accountable for it at the day of
   judgment." But this by the by.

   Our Saviour likewise tells us, that men shall not only be proceeded
   against for sins of commission, but for the bare omission and neglect
   of their duty, especially in works of mercy and charity; for not
   feeding the hungry, and the like, as we see, Matt. xxv. and that for
   the omission of these, he will pass that terrible sentence, "Depart ye
   cursed," &c. So that it nearly concerns us to be careful of our whole
   life, of all our words and actions, since the gospel hath so plainly
   and expressly declared, that "for all these things God will bring us
   into judgment." And if the threatenings of the gospel be true, "what
   manner of persons ought we to be, in all holy conversation and
   godliness?"

   Secondly, As the threatenings of the gospel are very plain and express,
   so are they likewise very dreadful and terrible. I want words to
   express the least part of the terror of them; and yet the expressions
   of Scripture concerning the misery and punishment of sinners in another
   world, are such as may raise amazement and horror in those that hear
   them. Sometimes it is expressed by a departing from God, and a
   perpetual banishment from his presence, who is the fountain of all
   comfort, and joy, and happiness; sometimes by the loss of our souls, or
   ourselves. "What shall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and
   lose his own soul?" or, (as it is in another evangelist) "to lose
   himself?" Not that our being shall be destroyed; that would be a happy
   loss indeed, to him that is sentenced to be for ever miserable; but the
   man shall still remain, and his body and soul continue to be the
   foundation of his misery, and a scene of perpetual woe and discontent,
   which our Saviour calls "the destroying of body and soul in hell," or
   going into everlasting punishment, "where there shall be wailing and
   gnashing of teeth, where the worm dies not, and the fire is not
   quenched." Could I represent to you the horror of that dismal prison,
   into which wicked and impure souls are to be thrust, and the misery
   they must there endure, without the least spark of comfort, or
   glimmering of hope; how they wail and groan under the intolerable wrath
   of God, the insolent scorn and cruelty of devils, the severe lashes and
   stings, raging anguish and horrible despair, of their own minds,
   without intermission, without pity, without hope of ever seeing an end
   of that misery, which yet is insupportable for one moment; could I
   represent these things to you according to the terror of them, what
   effect must they have upon us? and with what patience could any man
   bear to think of plunging himself into this misery? and by his own
   wilful fault and folly to endanger his coming into this place and state
   of torments? especially, if we consider, in the

   Third place, That the gospel hath likewise declared, that there is no
   avoiding of this misery, no hopes of impunity, if men go on and
   continue in their sins. The terms of the gospel in this are peremptory,
   that "except we repent, we shall perish;" that "without holiness, no
   man shall see the Lord;" that "the unrighteous shall not inherit the
   kingdom of God." And this is a very pressing consideration, and brings
   the matter to a short and plain issue. Either we must leave our sins,
   or die in them; either we must repent of them, or be judged for them;
   either we must forsake our sins, and break off that wicked course which
   we have lived in, or we must quit all hopes of heaven and happiness;
   nay, we cannot escape the damnation of hell. The clear revelation of a
   future judgment is so pressing an argument to repentance, as no man can
   in reason resist, that hath not a mind to be miserable. "Now (saith St.
   Paul to the Athenians) he straightly chargeth all men every where to
   repent, because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the
   world in righteousness."

   Men may cheat themselves, or suffer themselves to be deluded by others,
   about several means and devices of reconciling a wicked life, with the
   hopes of heaven and eternal salvation; as, by mingling some pangs of
   sorrow for sin, and some hot fits of devotion, with a sinful life;
   which is only the interruption of a wicked course, without reformation
   and amendment of life: but "let no man deceive you with vain words;"
   for our blessed Saviour hath provided no other ways to save men, but
   upon the terms of repentance and obedience.

   Fourthly, This argument takes hold of the most desperate and profligate
   sinners, and still retains its force upon the minds of men, when almost
   all other considerations fail, and have lost their efficacy upon us.
   Many men are gone so far in an evil course, that neither shame of their
   vices, nor the love of God and virtue, nor the hopes of heaven, are of
   any force with them, to reclaim them and bring them to a better mind:
   but there is one handle yet left, whereby to lay hold of them, and that
   is their fear. This is a passion that lies deep in our nature, being
   founded in self-preservation, and sticks so close to us, that we cannot
   quit ourselves of it, nor shake it off. Men may put off ingenuity, and
   break through all obligations of gratitude. Men may harden their
   foreheads, and conquer all sense of shame; but they can never perfectly
   stifle and subdue their fears; they can hardly so extinguish the fear
   of hell, but that some sparks of that fire will ever and anon be flying
   about in their consciences, especially when they are made sober, and
   brought to themselves by affliction, and by the present apprehensions
   of death have a nearer sight of another world. And if it was so hard
   for the heathen to conquer these apprehensions, how much harder must it
   be to Christians, who have so much greater assurance of these things,
   and to whom the wrath of God is so clearly revealed from heaven,
   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men?

   Fifthly, No religion in the world ever urged this argument upon men,
   with that force and advantage which Christianity does. The philosophy
   of the heathen gave men no steady assurance of the thing; the most
   knowing persons among them were not agreed about a future state; the
   greatest part of them spake but doubtfully concerning another life.
   And, besides the natural jealousies and suspicions of mankind
   concerning these things, they had only some fair probabilities of
   reason, and the authority of their poets, who talked they knew not what
   about the Elysian fields, and the infernal regions, and the three
   judges of hell; so that the wisest among them had hardly assurance
   enough in themselves of the truth of the thing to press it upon others
   with any great confidence, and therefore it was not likely to have any
   great efficacy upon the generality of mankind.

   As for the Jewish religion; though that supposed and took for granted
   the rewards of another world, as a principle of natural religion; yet
   in the law of Moses there was no particular and express revelation of
   the life of the world to come; and what was deduced from it, was by
   remote and obscure consequence. Temporal promises and threatenings it
   had many and clear; and their eyes were so dazzled with these, that it
   is probable that the generality of them did but little consider a
   future state, till they fell into great temporal calamities under the
   Grecian and Roman empires, whereby they were almost necessarily
   awakened to the consideration and hopes of a better life, to relieve
   them under their present evils and sufferings; and yet even in that
   time they were divided into two great factions about this mat ter, the
   one affirming, and the other as confidently denying, any life after
   this. But the gospel hath brought life and immortality to light; and we
   are assured from heaven of the truth and reality of another state, and
   a future judgment. The Son of God was sent into the world to preach
   this doctrine, and rose again from the dead, and was taken up into
   heaven, for a visible demonstration to all mankind of another life
   after this; and consequently of a future judgment, which no man ever
   doubted of, that did firmly believe a future state.

   The sum of all that I have said is this; the gospel hath plainly
   declared to us, that the only way to salvation is by forsaking our
   sins, and living a holy and virtuous life; and the most effectual
   argument in the world to persuade men to this, is the consideration of
   the infinite danger that a sinful course exposeth men to, since the
   wrath of God continually hangs over sinners, and, if they continue in
   their sins, will certainly fall upon them, and overwhelm them with
   misery; and he that is not moved by this argument, is lost to all
   intents and purposes.

   All that now remains is, to urge this argument upon men, and from the
   serious consideration of it, to persuade them to repent, and reform
   their wicked lives. And was there ever an age wherein this was more
   needful? when iniquity doth not only abound, but even rage among us;
   when infidelity and profaneness, and all manner of lewdness and vice,
   appears so boldly and openly, and men commit the greatest abominations
   without blushing at them; when vice hath got such head that it can
   hardly bear to be checked and controlled, and when, as the Roman
   historian complains of his times, ad ea tempora, quibus nec vitia
   nostra nec remedia pati possumus, perventum est; "things are come to
   that pass, that we can neither bear our vices nor the remedies of
   them?" Our vices are grown to a prodigious and intolerable height, and
   yet men hardly have the patience to hear of them; and surely a disease
   is then dangerous indeed, when it cannot bear the severity that is
   necessary to a cure. But yet, notwithstanding this, we who are the
   messengers of God to men, to warn them of their sin and danger, must
   not keep silence, and spare to tell them, both of their sins, and of
   the judgment of God which hangs over them; that God will "visit for
   these things," and that his soul will be avenged on such a nation as
   this. At least we may have leave to warn others, w ho are not yet run
   to the same excess of riot, to save themselves from this untoward
   generation. God's judgments are abroad in the earth, and call aloud
   upon us, to learn righteousness.

   But this is but a small consideration, in comparison of the judgment of
   another world, which we, who call ourselves Christians, do profess to
   believe, as one of the chief articles of our faith. The consideration
   of this should check and cool us in the heat of all our sinful
   pleasures; and that bitter irony of Solomon should cut us to the heart,
   "Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in
   the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the
   sight of thine eyes; but know, that for all these things God will bring
   thee into judgment/ 1 Think often and seriously on that time, wherein
   the wrath of God, which is now revealed against sin, shall be executed
   upon sinners; and if we believe this, we are strangely stupid and
   obstinate if we be not moved by it. The assurance of this made St. Paul
   extremely importunate in exhorting men to avoid so great danger; (2
   Cor. v. 10, 11.) "We must all appear before the judgment-seat of
   Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the body,
   according to what he hath done, whether it be good or evil. Knowing
   therefore the terrors of the Lord, we persuade men." And if this ought
   to move us to take so great a care of others, much more of ourselves.
   The judgment to come is a very amazing consideration; it is a fearful
   thing to hear of it, but it will be much more terrible to see it,
   especially to those whose guilt must needs make them so heartily
   concerned in the dismal consequences of it; and yet, as sure as I stand
   and you sit here, this great and terrible day of the Lord will come,
   and who may abide his coming? what will we do, when that day shall
   surprise us careless and unprepared? what unspeakable horror and
   amazement will then take hold of us! when, lifting up our eyes to
   heaven, we shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of it, with
   power and great glory; when that powerful voice, which shall pierce the
   ears of the dead, shall ring through the world, "Arise ye dead, and
   come to judgment;" when the mighty trumpet shall sound, and wake the
   sleepers of a thousand years, and summon the dispersed parts of the
   bodies of all men that ever lived, to rally together and take their
   place; and the souls and bodies of men, which have been so long
   strangers to one another, shall meet and be united again, to receive
   the doom due to their deeds; what fear shall then surprise sinners, and
   how will they tremble at the presence of the great Judge, and for the
   glory of his Majesty! how will their consciences fly in their faces,
   and their own hearts condemn them, for their wicked and ungodly lives,
   and even prevent that sentence which yet shall certainly be passed and
   executed upon them! But I will proceed no farther in this argument,
   which hath so much of terror in it.

   I will conclude my sermon, as Solomon doth his Ecclesiastes: (chap.
   xii. 13, 14.) "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter; fear
   God, and keep his commandments, for this is the whole of man; for God
   shall bring every work into judgment, and every secret thing, whether
   it be good, or whether it be evil." To which I will only add that
   serious and merciful admonition of a greater than Solomon; I mean the
   great Judge of the whole world, our blessed Lord and Saviour: (Luke
   xxi. 34-36.) "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
   overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and the cares of this
   life, and so that day come upon you at unawares. For as a snare shall
   it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch
   ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to
   escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before
   the Son of man." To whom, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, &c.

SERMON CXII.

  KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE NECESSARY IN RELIGION.

   If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.--John xiii. 17.

   Two things make up religion, the knowledge and the practice of it; and
   the first is wholly in order to the second; and God hath not revealed
   to us the knowledge of himself and his will, merely for the improvement
   of our understanding, but for the bettering of our hearts and lives:
   not to entertain bur minds with the speculations of religion and
   virtue, but to form and govern our actions. "If ye know these things,
   happy are ye if ye do them."

   In which words our blessed Saviour does, from a particular instance,
   take occasion to settle a general conclusion; namely, that religion
   doth mainly consist in practice, and that the knowledge of his
   doctrine, without the real effects of it upon our lives, will bring no
   man to heaven. In the beginning of this chapter, our great Lord and
   Master, to testify his love to his disciples, and to give them a lively
   in stance and example of that great virtue of humility, is pleased to
   condescend to a very low and mean office, such as was used to be
   performed by servants to their masters, and not by the master to his
   servants; namely, to wash their feet: and when he had clone this, he
   asks them if they did understand the meaning of this strange action.
   "Know ye what I have done unto you? ye call me Master, and Lord, and ye
   say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed
   your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet; for I have given
   you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than the Lord,
   neither he that is sent, greater than he that sent him; if ye know
   these things, happy are ye if ye do them." As if he had said, This
   which I have now done, is easy to be understood; and so likewise are
   all those other Christian graces and virtues, which I have heretofore,
   by my doctrine and example, recommended to you; but it is not enough to
   know these things, but ye must likewise do them. The end and the life
   of all our knowledge in religion is to put in practice what we know. It
   is necessary, indeed, that we should know our duty, but knowledge alone
   will never bring us to that happiness which religion designs to make us
   partakers of, if our knowledge have not its due and proper influence
   upon our lives. Nay, so far will our knowledge be from making us happy,
   if it be separated from the virtues of a good life, that it will prove
   one of tin heaviest aggravations of our misery; and it is as if he had
   said, "If ye know these things, woe be unto you, if ye do them not."

   From these words, then, I shall observe these three things, which I
   shall speak but briefly to.

   First, That the knowledge of God's will, and our duty, is necessary to
   the practice of it; "If ye know the these things," which supposeth,
   that we must know our duty, before we can do it.

   Secondly, That the knowledge of our duty, and the practice of it, may
   be, and too often are, separated. This likewise the text supposeth,
   that men may know their duty, and yet not do it; and that this is very
   frequent, which is the reason why our Saviour gives this caution.

   Thirdly, That the practice of religion, and the doing of what we know
   to be our duty, is the only way to happiness; "If ye know these things,
   happy are ye if ye do them." I begin with the

   First of these; namely, That the knowledge of God's will and our duty
   is necessary, in order to the practice of it. The truth of this
   proposition is so clear and evident, at first view, that nothing can
   obscure it, and bring it in question, but to endeavour to prove it; and
   therefore, instead of spending time in that, I shall take occasion from
   it justly to reprove that preposterous course which is taken, and
   openly avowed and justified by some, as the safest and best way to make
   men religious, and to bring them to happiness; namely, by taking away
   from them the means of knowledge; as if the best \\ay to bring men to
   do the will of God, were to keep men from knowing it. For what else can
   be the meaning of that maxim so current in the church of Rome, that
   "ignorance is the mother of devotion?" or of that strange and injurious
   practice of theirs of locking up from the people that great storehouse
   and treasury of Divine knowledge, the Holy Scriptures, in an unknown
   tongue?

   I know very well, that, in justification of this hard usage of their
   people, it is pretended that knowledge is apt to puff men up, to make
   them proud and contentious, refractory and disobedient, and heretical,
   and what not; and, particularly, that the free and familiar use of the
   Holy Scriptures permitted to the people, hath ministered occasion to
   the people of falling into great and dangerous errors, and of making
   great disturbance and divisions among Christians. For answer to tins
   pretence, I desire these four or five things may be considered.

   First, That unless this be the natural and necessary effect of
   knowledge in religion, and of the free use of the Holy Scriptures,
   there is no force in this reason; and if this be the proper and natural
   effect of this knowledge, then this reason will reach a great way
   farther, than those who make use of it are willing it should.

   Secondly, That this is not the natural and necessary effect of
   knowledge in religion, but only accidental, and proceeding from men's
   abuse of it; for which the thing itself is not to be taken away.

   Thirdly, That the proper and natural effects and consequences of
   ignorance, are equally pernicious, and much more certain and
   unavoidable, than those which are accidentally occasioned by knowledge.

   Fourthly, That if this reason be good, it is much stronger for
   withholding the Scriptures from the priests and the. learned, than from
   the people.

   Fifthly, That this danger was as great, and as ell known in the
   apostles times, and yet they took quite contrary course.

   First, I desire it may be considered, that, unless this be the natural
   and necessary effect of knowledge in religion, and of the free use of
   the Holy Scriptures there is no force in this reason, for that which is
   necessary, or highly useful, ought not to be taken away, because it is
   liable to be perverted, and abused to ill purposes. If it ought, then
   not only knowledge in religion, but all other knowledge ought to be
   restrained and suppressed; for all knowledge is apt to puff up, and
   liable to be abused to many ill purposes. At this rate, light, and
   liberty, and reason, yea, and life itself, ought all to be taken away,
   because they are all greatly abused, by many men, to some ill purposes
   or other; so that unless these ill effects do naturally and necessarily
   spring from knowledge in religion, the objection from them is of no
   force; and if they do necessarily flow from it, then this reason will
   reach a great way farther than those that make use of it are willing it
   should; for if this be true, that the knowledge of religion, as it is
   revealed in the Holy Scriptures, is of its own nature so pernicious, as
   to make men proud, and contentious, and heretical, and disobedient to
   authority; then the blame of all this would fall upon our blessed
   Saviour, for revealing so pernicious a doctrine, and upon his apostles
   for publishing this doctrine in a known tongue to all mankind, and
   thereby laying the foundation of perpetual schisms and heresies in the
   church.

   Secondly, But this is not the natural and necessary effect of knowledge
   in religion, but only accidental, and proceeding from men's abuse of
   it, for which the thing itself ought not to be taken away. And thus
   much certainly they will grant, because it cannot with any face be
   denied; and if so, then the means of knowledge are not to be denied,
   but only men are to be cautioned not to pervert and abuse them. And if
   any man abuse the Holy Scriptures to the patronizing of error or
   heresy, or to any other bad purpose, he does it at his peril, and must
   give an account to God for it, but ought not to be deprived of the
   means of knowledge, for fear he should make an ill use of them. We must
   not hinder men from being Christians, to preserve them from being
   heretics, and put out men's eyes, for fear they should some time or
   other take upon them to dispute their way with their guides.

   I remember that St. Paul, (1 Cor. viii. 1.) takes notice of this
   accidental inconvenience of knowledge, that it puffeth up; and that
   this pride occasioned great contentions and divisions among them: but
   the remedy which he prescribes against this mischief of knowledge, is
   not to withhold from men the means of it, and to celebrate the service
   of God, the prayers of the church, and the reading of the Scriptures in
   an unknown tongue, but, quite contrary (chap. xiv. of that Epistle), he
   strictly enjoins that the service of God in the church be so performed
   as may be for the edification of the people; which, he says, cannot be,
   if it be celebrated in an unknown tongue; and the remedy he prescribes
   against the accidental mischief and inconvenience of knowledge is not
   ignorance, but charity, to govern their knowledge, and to help them to
   make right use of it; (ver. 20. of that chapter,) after he had declared
   that the service of God ought to be performed in a known tongue, he
   immediately adds, "Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit
   in malice be ye children, but in understanding be ye men." He commends
   knowledge, he encourageth it, he requires it of all Christians; BO far
   is he from checking the pursuit of it, and depriving the people of the
   means of it. And indeed there is nothing in the Christian religion, but
   what is fit for every man to know, because there is nothing in it, but
   what is designed to promote holiness and a good life; and if men make
   any other use of their knowledge it is their own fault, for it
   certainly tends to make men good; and being so useful and necessary to
   so good a purpose, men ought not to be debarred of it.

   Thirdly, Let it be considered, that the proper and natural effects and
   consequences of ignorance are equally pernicious, and much more certain
   and unavoidable, than those which are accidentally occasioned by
   knowledge; for so far as a man is ignorant of his duty, it is
   impossible he should do it. He that hath the knowledge of religion, may
   be a bad Christian; but he that is destitute of it, can be none at all.
   Or if ignorance do beget and promote some kind of devotion in men, it
   is such a devotion as is not properly religion, but superstition; the
   ignorant man may be zealously superstitious, but without some measure
   of knowledge no man can be truly religious. "That the soul be without
   knowledge it is not good," says Solomon, (Prov. xix. 2.) because good
   practices depend upon our knowledge, and must be directed by it;
   whereas, a man that is trained up only to the outward performance of
   some things in religion, as to the saying over so many prayers in an
   unknown tongue, this man cannot be truly religious; because nothing is
   religious that is not a reasonable service, and no service can be
   reasonable that is not directed by our understanding. Indeed, if the
   end of prayer were only to give God to understand what we want, it were
   all one what language we prayed in, and whether we understood what we
   asked of him or not; but so long as the end of prayer is to testify the
   sense of our own wants, and of our dependance upon God for the supply
   of them, it is impossible that any man should, in any tolerable
   propriety of speech, be said to pray, who does not understand what he
   asks; and the saying over so many pater-nosters by one that does not
   understand the meaning of them, is no more a prayer, than the repeating
   over so many verses in Virgil. And if this were good reasoning, that
   men must not be permitted to know so much as they can in religion, for
   fear they should grow troublesome with their knowledge, then certainly
   the best way in the world to maintain peace in the Christian church,
   would be to let the people know nothing at all in religion; and the
   best way to secure the ignorance of the people would be to keep the
   priests as ignorant as the people, and then, to be sure, they could
   teach them nothing; but then the mischief would be, that, out of a
   fondness to maintain peace in the Christian church, there would be no
   church, nor no Christianity; which would be the same wise contrivance,
   as if a prince should destroy his subjects to keep his kingdom quiet.

   Fourthly, Let us likewise consider, that if this reason be good, it is
   much stronger for withholding the Scriptures from the priests and the
   learned, than from the people; because the danger of starting errors
   and heresies, and countenancing them from Scripture, and managing them
   plausibly and with advantage, is much more to be feared from the
   learned than from the common people; and the experience of all ages
   hath shewn, that the great broachers and abetters of heresy in the
   Christian church, have been men of learning and wit; and most of the
   famous heresies, that are recorded in. ecclesiastical history, have
   their names from some learned man or other; so that it is a great
   mistake to think that the way to prevent error and heresy in the
   church, is to take the Bible out of the hands of the people, so long as
   the free use of it is permitted to men of learning and skill, in whose
   hands the danger of perverting it is much greater. The ancient fathers,
   I am sure, do frequently prescribe to the people the constant and
   careful reading of the Holy Scriptures, as the surest antidote against
   the poison of dangerous errors, and damnable heresies; and if there be
   so much danger of seduction into error from the oracles of truth, by
   what other or better means can we hope to be secured against this
   danger? if the word of God be so cross and improper a means to this
   end, one would think that the teachings of men should be much less
   effectual; so that men must either be left in their ignorance, or they
   must be permitted to learn from the word of truth; and whatever force
   this reason of the danger of heresy hath in it, to deprive the common
   people of the use of the Scriptures, I am sure it is much stronger to
   wrest them out of the hands of the priests and the learned, because
   they are much more capable of perverting them to so bad a purpose.

   Fifthly, and lastly, This danger was as great and visible in the age of
   the apostles, as it is now; and yet they took a quite contrary course:
   there were heresies then as well as now, and either the Scriptures were
   not thought, by being in the hands of the people, to be the cause of
   them, or they did not think the taking of them out of their hands a
   proper remedy. The apostles, in all their epistles, do earnestly exhort
   the people to grow in knowledge, and commend them for searching the
   Scriptures, and charge them that the word of God should dwell richly in
   them. And St. Peter takes particular notice of some men wresting some
   difficult passages in St. Paul's epistles, as likewise in the other
   Scriptures, to their own destruction, (2 Pet. iii. 16.) where, speaking
   of St. Paul's epistles, he says, "there are some things hard to be
   understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they
   do also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction." Here the
   danger objected is taken notice of; but the remedy prescribed by St.
   Peter, is not to take from the people the use of the Scriptures, and to
   keep them in ignorance; but, after he had cautioned against the like
   weakness and errors, he exhorts them to grow in knowledge; (ver. 17,
   18.) "Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before (that
   is, seeing ye are so plainly told and warned of this danger), beware
   lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from
   your own steadfastness; but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our
   Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;" (that is, of the Christian religion;)
   believing, it seems, that the more knowledge they had in religion, the
   less they would be in danger of falling into damn able errors. I
   proceed to the

   Second observation; viz. That the knowledge of our duty, and the
   practice of it, may and often are separated. This likewise is supposed
   in the text; that men may, and often do, know the will of God, and
   their duty, and yet fail in the practice of it. Our Saviour, elsewhere,
   supposed] that many know their Master's will, who do not do it; and he
   compares those that hear his sayings, and do them not, to a foolish man
   that built his house upon the sand. And St. James speaks of some, who
   are "hearers of the word only, but not doers of it;" and for that
   reason fall short of happiness. And this is no wonder, because the
   attaining to that knowledge of religion which is necessary to salvation
   is no difficult task. A great part of it is written in our hearts, and
   we cannot be ignorant of it if we would; as, that there is a God, and a
   Providence, and another state after this life, wherein we shall be
   rewarded or punished, according as we have lived here in this world;
   that God is to be worshipped, to he prayed to for what we want, and to
   be praised for what we enjoy. Thus far nature instructs men in
   religion, and in the great duties of morality, as justice and
   temperance, and the like. And as for revealed religion, as, that Jesus
   Christ the Son of God came in our nature to save us, by revealing our
   duty more clearly and fully to us, by giving us a more perfect example
   of holiness and obedience in his own life and conversation, and by
   dying for our sins, and rising again for our justification; these are
   things which men may easily understand; and yet, for ail that, they are
   with difficulty brought to the practice of religion.

   I shall instance in three sorts of persons, in whom the knowledge of
   religion is more remarkably separated from the practice of it; and, for
   distinction's sake, I may call them by these names--the speculative,
   the formal, and the hypocritical Christian. The first of these makes
   religion only a science; the second takes it up for a fashion; the
   third makes some worldly advantage of it, and serves some secular
   interest and design by it. All these are, upon several accounts,
   concerned to understand some thing of religion; but yet will not be
   brought to the practice of it.

   The first of these, whom I call the speculative Christian, is he who
   makes religion only a science, and studies it as a piece of learning,
   and part of that general knowledge in which he affects the reputation
   of being a master; he hath no design to practise it, but he is loath to
   be ignorant of it, because the knowledge of it is a good ornament of
   conversation, and will serve for discourse and entertainment among
   those who are disposed to be grave and serious; and because he does not
   intend to practise it, he passeth over those things which are plain and
   easy to he understood, and applies himself chiefly to the consideration
   of those things which are more abstruse, and will afford matter of
   controversy and subtle dispute; as the doctrine of the trinity,
   predestination, free-will, and the like. Of this temper seem many of
   the schoolmen of old to have been, who made it their great study and
   business to puzzle religion, and to make every thing in it intricate,
   by starting infinite questions and difficulties about the plainest
   truths; and of the same rank usually are the heads and leaders of
   parties and factions in religion, who, by needless controversies, and
   endless disputes about something or other, commonly of no great moment
   in religion, hinder themselves and others from minding the practice of
   the great and substantial duties of a good life.

   Secondly, There is the formal Christian, who takes up religion for a
   fashion. He is born and bred in a nation where Christianity is
   professed and countenanced, and therefore thinks it convenient for him
   to know something of it. Of this sort there are, I fear, a great many,
   who read the Scriptures some times as others do, to know the history of
   it; and go to church, and hear the gospel preached, and by this means
   come, in some measure, to understand the history of our Saviour, and
   the Christian doctrine; but do not at all bend themselves to comply
   with the great end and design of it; they do not heartily endeavour to
   form and fashion their lives according to the laws and precepts of it;
   they think they are very good Christians, if they can give an account
   of the articles of their faith, profess their belief in God and Christ,
   and declare that they hope to be saved by him, though they take no care
   to keep his commandments. These are they of whom our Saviour speaks,
   (Luke vi. 46.) who call him, "Lord, Lord; but do not the things which
   he said."

   Thirdly, Hypocritical Christians, who make an interest of religion, and
   serve some worldly design by it. These are concerned to understand
   religion more than ordinary, that they may counterfeit it handsomely,
   and may not be at a loss when they have occasion to put on the garb of
   it. And this is one part of the character which the apostle gives of
   those persons, who he foretels would appear in the last days: (2 Tim.
   iii. 2.) he says they should be "lovers of their own selves, covetous,
   heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, having
   a form of godliness, but denying the power of it."

   Now these men do not love religion, but they have occasion to make use
   of it, and therefore they will have no more of it than will just serve
   their purpose and design. And, indeed, he that hath any other design in
   religion than to please God, and save his soul, needs no more than so
   much knowledge of it, as will serve him to act a part in it upon
   occasion. I come to the

   Third and last observation; viz. That the practice of religion, and the
   doing of what we know to be our duty, is the only way to happiness; "If
   ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them;" not "if you know
   these things happy are ye;" but "if ye know and do them." Now to
   convince men of so important a truth, I shall endeavour to make out
   these two things:

   First, That the gospel makes the practice of religion a necessary
   condition of our happiness.

   Secondly, That the nature and reason of the thing makes it a necessary
   qualification for it.

   First, The gospel makes the practice of religion a necessary condition
   of our happiness. Our Saviour, in his first sermon, where he repeats
   the promise of blessedness so often, makes no promise of it to the mere
   knowledge of religion, but to the habit and practice of Christian
   graces and virtues, of meekness, and humility, and mercifulness, and
   righteousness, and peaceableness, "and purity, and patience under
   sufferings, and persecutions for righteousness sake." And (Matt. vii.
   22.) our Saviour doth most fully declare, that the happiness which he
   promises did not belong to those who made profession of his name, and
   were so well acquainted with his doctrine, as to be able to instruct
   others, if themselves in the mean time did not practise it; "Not every
   one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
   heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
   Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have wo not prophesied
   in thy name, and in thy name cast out devils, and done many wondrous
   works? and then will I profess unto them, I never knew you, depart from
   me, ye workers of iniquity." Though they profess to know him, yet,
   because their lives wire not answerable to the knowledge which they had
   of him and his doctrine, he declares that he will not know them, but
   bid them depart from him. And then he goes on to shew, that though a
   man attend to the doctrine of Christ, and gain the knowledge of it;
   yet, if it do not descend into his life, and govern his actions, all
   that man's hopes of heaven are fond and groundless; and only that man's
   hopes of heaven are well grounded, who knows the doctrine of Christ and
   does it: (ver. 24.) "Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
   them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock;
   and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
   beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock:
   and every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not,
   shall he likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand;
   and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
   beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it."
   Though a man had a knowledge of religion as great and perfect as that
   which Solomon had of natural things, large as the sand upon the
   sea-shore, yet all this knowledge separated from practice would be like
   the sand also in another respect, a weak foundation for any man to
   build his hopes of happiness upon.

   To the same purpose St. Paul speaks: (Rom. ii. 13.) "Not the hearers of
   the law are just before God; but the doers of the law shall be
   justified." So likewise St. James: (chap. i. 22.) "Be ye doers of the
   word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves;" and, (ver. 25.)
   "Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, (that is, the law or
   doctrine of the gospel,) and continueth therein, he being not a
   forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in
   his deed;" and therefore he adds, that the truth and reality of
   religion are to be measured by the effects of it, in the government of
   our words, and ordering of our lives: (ver. 26.) "If any man among you
   seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his
   own heart, this man's religion is vain. Pure religion, and undefiled
   before God and the Father is this; to visit the fatherless and widow in
   their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." Men
   talk of religion, and keep a great .stir about it; but no thing will
   pass for "true religion before God," but the virtuous and charitable
   actions of a good life; and God will accept no man to eternal life upon
   any other condition. So the apostle tells us most expressly: (Heb. xii.
   14.) "Follow peace with nil men, and holiness, without which no man
   shall see the Lord."

   Secondly, As God hath made the practice of religion a necessary
   condition of our happiness, so the very nature and reason of the thing
   makes it a necessary qualification for it. It is necessary that we
   become like to God, in order to the enjoyment of him; and nothing makes
   us like to God, but the practice of holiness and goodness. Knowledge,
   indeed, is a Divine perfection; but that alone, as it doth not render a
   man like God, so neither doth it dispose him for the enjoyment of him.
   If a man had the understanding of an angel, he might for all that be a
   devil; "he that committeth sin is of the devil," and whatever knowledge
   such a man may have, be is of a devilish temper and disposition: "but
   everyone that doeth righteousness is born of God." By this we are like
   God, and only by our likeness to him, do we become capable of the sight
   and enjoyment of him; therefore every man that hopes to be happy by the
   blessed sight of God in the next life, must endeavour after holiness in
   this life. So the same apostle tells us, (1 John iii. 3.) "Every man
   that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is pure." A
   wicked temper and disposition of mind is, in the very nature of the
   thing, utterly inconsistent with all reasonable hopes of heaven.

   Thus I have shewn that the practice of religion, and the doing of what
   we know to be our duty, is the only way to happiness.

   And now the proper inference from all this is, to put men upon the
   careful practice of religion. Let no man content himself with the
   knowledge of his duty, unless he do it; and to this purpose I shall
   briefly urge these three considerations:

   First, This is the great end of all our knowledge in religion, to
   practise what we know. The knowledge of God and of our duty hath so
   essential a respect to practice, that the Scripture will hardly allow
   it to be properly called knowledge, unless it have an influence upon
   our lives: (1 John ii. 3, 4.) "Hereby we know that we know him, if we
   keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his
   commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."

   Secondly, Practice is the best way to increase and perfect our
   knowledge. Knowledge directs us in our practice, but practice confirms
   and increaseth our knowledge: (John vii. 17.) "If a man will do the
   will of God, he shall know of the doctrine." The best way to know God,
   is to belike him ourselves, and to have the lively image of his
   perfections imprinted upon our souls; and the best way to understand
   the Christian religion, is seriously to set about the practice of it;
   this will give a man a better notion of Christianity, than any
   speculation can.

   Thirdly, Without the practice of religion, our knowledge will be so far
   from being any furtherance and advantage to our happiness, that it will
   be one of the unhappiest aggravations of our misery. He that is
   ignorant of his duty, hath some excuse to pretend for himself: but he
   that understands the Christian religion, and does not live according to
   it, hath no cloak for his sin. The defects of our knowledge, unless
   they be gross and wilful, will find an easy pardon with God: but the
   faults of our lives shall be severely punished, when we know our duty,
   and would not do it. I will conclude with that of our Saviour: (Luke
   xii. 47, 48.) "That servant which knew his lord's will, and prepared
   not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with
   many stripes: for unto whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be
   required." When we come into the other world, no consideration will
   sting us more, and add more to the rage of our torments than this, that
   we did wickedly, when we understood to have done better; and chose to
   make ourselves miserable, when we knew so well the way to have been
   happy.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CXIII.

  PRACTICE IN RELIGION NECESSARY IN PROPORTION TO OUR KNOWLEDGE.

   And that servant which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself,
   neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes:
   but he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be
   beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him
   shall be much required; and to whom men have committed much, of him
   they will ask the more.--Luke xii. 47, 48.

   IN prosecution of the argument which I handled in my last discourse;
   namely, that the knowledge of our duty, without the practice of it,
   will not bring us to happiness, I shall proceed to shew, that if our
   practice be not answerable to our knowledge, this will be a great
   aggravation both of our sin and punishment.

   And to this purpose, I have pitched upon these words of our Lord, which
   are the application of two parables, which he had delivered before, to
   stir up men to a diligent and careful practice of their duty, that so
   they may be in a continual readiness and preparation for the coming of
   their Lord. The first parable is more general, and concerns all men,
   who are represented as so many servants in a great family, from which
   the lord is absent, and they being uncertain of the time of his return,
   should always be in a condition and posture to receive him. Upon the
   hearing of this parable, Peter inquires of our Saviour, whether he
   intended this only for his disciples, or for all? To which question our
   Saviour returns an answer in another parable which more particularly
   concerned them; who, because they were to be the chief rulers and
   governors of his church, are represented by the stewards of a great
   family: (ver. 42.) "Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom
   his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their
   portion of meat in due season?" If he discharge his duty, blessed is
   he; but if he shall take occasion in his lord's absence to domineer
   over his fellow-servants, and riotously to waste his lord's goods, his
   lord, when he comes, will punish him after a more severe and exemplary
   manner.

   And then follows the application of the whole in the words of the text:
   "and that servant which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself,
   neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."
   As if he had said, and well may such a servant deserve so severe a
   punishment, who having such a trust committed to him, and knowing his
   lord's will so much better, yet does contrary to it; upon which our
   Saviour takes occasion to compare the fault and punishment of those who
   have greater advantages and opportunities of knowing their duty, with
   those who are ignorant of it; "that servant which knew his lord's will,
   and prepared not himself, neither did according to it, shall be beaten
   with many stripes: but he that knew not, but did commit things worthy
   of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes." And then he adds the
   reason and the equity of this proceeding: "For unto whomsoever much is
   given, of him shall be much required; and to whom men have committed
   much, of him they will ask the more."

   The words in general do allude to that law of the Jews, mentioned Deut.
   xxv. 2. where the judge is required to see the malefactor punished
   according to his fault, by a certain number of stripes; in relation to
   which known law among the Jews, our Saviour here says, that "those who
   knew their lord's will, and did it not, should be beaten with many
   stripes: but those who knew it not, should be beaten with few stripes."
   So that there are two observations lie plainly before us in the words.

   First, That the greater advantages and opportunities any man hath of
   knowing his duty, if he do it not, the greater will be his
   condemnation; "the servant which knew his lord's will, and prepared not
   himself, neither did according to it, shall be beaten with many
   stripes."

   Secondly, That ignorance is a great excuse of men's faults, and will
   lessen their punishment; "but he that knew not, but did commit things
   worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.

   I shall begin with the latter of these first, because it will make way
   for the other; viz. that ignorance is a great excuse of men's faults,
   and will lessen their punishment; "he that knew not, but did commit
   things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes."

   For the clearing of this, it will be requisite to consider what
   ignorance it is which our Saviour here speaks of; and this is necessary
   to be inquired into, because it is certain that there is some sort of
   ignorance which doth wholly excuse and clear from all manner of guilt;
   and there is another sort, which doth either not at all, or very
   little, extenuate the faults of men; so that it must be a third sort,
   different from both these, which our Saviour here means.

   First, There is an ignorance which doth wholly excuse and clear from
   all manner of guilt, and that is an absolute and invincible ignorance,
   when a person is wholly ignorant of the thing, which, if he knew, he
   should be bound to do, but neither can nor could have helped it, that
   he is ignorant of it; that is, he either had not the capacity, or
   wanted the means and opportunity, of knowing it. In this case a person
   is in no fault, if he did not do what he never knew, nor could know to
   be his duty. For God measures the faults of men by their wills, and if
   there be no defect there, there can be no guilt; for no man is guilty,
   but he that is conscious to himself that he would not do what he knew
   he ought to do, or would do what he knew he ought not to do. Now, if a
   man be simply and invincibly ignorant of his duty, his neglect of it is
   altogether involuntary; for the will hath nothing to do, where the
   understanding doth not first direct. And this is the case of children
   who are not yet come to the use of reason; for though they may do that
   which is materially a fault, yet it is none in them, because, by reason
   of their incapacity, they are at present invincibly ignorant of what
   they ought to do. And this is the case likewise of idiots, who are
   under a natural incapacity of knowledge, and so far as they are so,
   nothing that they do is imputed to them as a fault. The same n ay be
   said of distracted persons, who are deprived either wholly, or at some
   times, of the use of their understandings: so far, and so long as they
   are thus deprived, they are free from all guilt; and to persons who
   have the free and perfect use of their reason, no neglect of any duty
   is imputed, of which they are absolutely and invincibly ignorant. For
   instance, it is a duty incumbent upon all mankind, to believe in the
   Son of God, where he is sufficiently manifested and revealed to them;
   but those who never heard of him, nor had any opportunity of coming to
   the knowledge of him, shall not be condemned for this infidelity,
   because it is impossible they should believe on him of whom they never
   heard; they may, indeed, be condemned upon other accounts, for sinning
   against the light of nature, and for not obeying the law which was
   "written in their hearts;" for what the apostle says of the revelation
   of the law, is as true of any other revelation of God. "As many as have
   sinned without law, shall also perish without law; and as many as have
   sinned under the law, shall be judged by the law:" (Rom. ii. 12.) in
   like manner, those who have sinned without the gospel, (that is, who
   never had the knowledge of it) shall not be condemned for any offence
   against that revelation which was never made to them, but for their
   violation of the law of nature; only they that have sinned under the
   gospel shall be judged by it.

   Secondly, There is likewise another sort of ignorance, which either
   does not at all, or very little, extenuate the faults of men; when men
   are not only ignorant, but choose to be so; that is, when they wilfully
   neglect those means and opportunities of knowledge which are afforded
   to them; such as Job speaks of: (Job xxi. 14.) "Who say unto God,
   Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways." And this
   sort of ignorance many among the Jews were guilty of when our Saviour
   came and preached to them, but they would not be instructed by him; the
   light came among them, but they loved "darkness rather than light," as
   he himself says of them; and, as he says elsewhere of the pharisees,
   "they rejected the council of God against themselves;" they wilfully
   shut their eyes against that light which offered itself to them; "they
   would not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand
   with their hearts, that they might be converted and healed." Now an
   ignorance, in this degree wilful, can hardly he imagined to carry any
   excuse at all in it. He that knew not his Lord's will, because he would
   not know it, because he wilfully rejected the means of coming to the
   knowledge of it, deserves to be beaten with as many stripes, as if he
   had known it; because he might have known it, and would not. He that
   will not take notice of the king's proclamation, or will stop his ears
   when it is read, and afterwards offends against it, does equally
   deserve punishment with those who have read it, and heard it, and
   disobey it; because he was as grossly faulty in not knowing it; and
   there is no reason that any man's gross fault should be his excuse.

   So that it is neither of these sorts of ignorance that our Saviour
   means, neither absolute and invincible ignorance, nor that which is
   grossly wilful and affected: for the first, men deserve not to be
   beaten at all, because they cannot help it; for the latter, they
   deserve not to be excused, because they might have helped their
   ignorance, and would not.

   But our Saviour here speaks of such an ignorance as does in a good
   degree extenuate the fault, and yet not wholly excuse it; for he says
   of them, that they knew not their lord's will; and yet that this
   ignorance did not wholly excuse them from blame, nor exempt them from
   punishment, but they should "be beaten with few stripes." In the

   Third place, then, There is an ignorance which is in some degree
   faulty, and yet does in a great measure excuse the faults which proceed
   from it; and this is when men are not absolutely ignorant of their
   duty, but only in comparison of others, who have a far more clear and
   distinct knowledge of it; and though they do not grossly and wilfully
   neglect the means of further knowledge, yet, perhaps, they do not make
   the best use they might of the opportunities they have of knowing their
   duty better; and therefore, in comparison of others, who have far
   better means and advantages of knowing their Lord's will, they may be
   said not to know it, though they are not simply ignorant of it, but
   only have a more obscure and uncertain knowledge of it. Now this
   ignorance does in a great measure excuse such persons, and extenuate
   their crimes, in comparison of those who had a clearer and more perfect
   knowledge of their Master's will; and yet it does not free them from
   all guilt, because they did not live up to that degree of knowledge
   which they had; and perhaps if they had used more care and industry,
   they might have known their Lord's will better. And this was the case
   of the heathens, who, in comparison of those who enjoyed the light of
   the gospel, might be said not to have known their Lord's will; though
   as to many parts of their duty, they had some directions from natural
   light, and their consciences did urge them to many things by the
   obscure apprehensions and hopes of a future reward, and the fear of a
   future punishment. But this was but a very obscure and uncertain
   knowledge, in comparison of the clear light of the gospel, which hath
   discovered to us our duty so plainly by the laws and precepts of it,
   and hath presented us with such powerful motives and arguments to
   obedience in the promises and threatenings of it. And this, likewise,
   is the case of many Christians, who, either through the natural
   slowness of their understandings, or by the neglect of their parents
   and teachers, or other circumstances of their education, have had far
   less means and advantages of knowledge than others. God does not expect
   so much from those as from others, to whom he hath given greater
   capacity and advantages of knowledge; and when our Lord shall come to
   call his servants to an account, they shall be beaten with fewer
   stripes than others; they shall not wholly escape, because they were
   not wholly ignorant; but by how much they had less knowledge than
   others, by so much their punishment shall be lighter.

   And there is all the equity in the world it should be so, that men
   should be accountable according to what they have received, and that,
   to whom less is given, less should be required at their hands. The
   Scripture hath told us, that "God will judge the world in
   righteousness;" now justice does require, that, in taxing the
   punishment of offenders, every thing should be considered that may be a
   just excuse and extenuation of their crimes, and that, accordingly,
   their punishment should be abated. Now the greatest extenuation of any
   fault is ignorance, which, when it proceeds from no fault of ours, no
   fault can proceed from it; so that so far as any man is innocently
   ignorant of his duty, so far he is excusable for the neglect of it: for
   every degree of ignorance takes off so much from the perverseness of
   the will; et nihil ardet in inferno, nisi propria voluntas. "Nothing is
   punished in hell but what is voluntary, and proceeds from our wills."

   I do not intend this discourse for any commendation of ignorance, or
   encouragement to it. For knowledge hath many advantages above it, and
   is much more desirable, if we use it well; and if we do not, it is our
   own fault; if we be not wanting to ourselves, we may be much happier by
   our knowledge than any man can be by his ignorance; for though
   ignorance may plead an excuse, yet it can hope for no reward; and it is
   always better to need no excuse, than to have the best in the world
   ready at hand to plead for ourselves. Besides that, we may do well to
   consider, that ignorance is no where an excuse where it is cherished;
   so that it would be the vainest thing in the world for any man to
   foster it in hopes thereby to excuse himself; for where it is wilful
   and chosen it is a fault, and (as I said before) it is the most
   unreasonable thing in the world, that any man's fault should prove his
   excuse. So that this can be no encouragement to ignorance, to say that
   it extenuates the faults of men: for it does not extenuate them
   whenever it is wilful and affected; and whenever it is designed and
   chosen it is wilful; and then no man can reasonably design to continue
   ignorant, that he may have an excuse for his faults, because then the
   ignorance is wilful; and, whenever it is so, it ceaseth to be an
   excuse.

   I the rather speak this, because ignorance hath had the good fortune to
   meet with great patrons in the world, and to be extolled, though not
   upon this account, yet upon another, for which there is less pretence
   of reason; as if it were the mother of devotion. Of superstition, I
   grant it is, and of this we see plentiful proof among those who are so
   careful to preserve and cherish it: but that true piety and devotion
   should spring from it, is as unlikely as that darkness should produce
   light. I do hope, indeed, and charitably believe, that the ignorance in
   which some are detained by their teachers and governors, will be a real
   excuse to as many of them as are otherwise honest and sincere: but I
   doubt not, but the errors and faults which proceed from this ignorance
   will lie heavy upon those who keep them in it. I proceed to the

   Second observation, That the greater advantages and opportunities any
   man hath of knowing the will of God, and his duty, the greater will be
   his condemnation if he do not do it. "The servant which knew his lord's
   will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to it, shall be
   beaten with many stripes. Which knew his lord's will, and prepared not
   himself;" the preparation of our mind to do the will of God, whenever
   there is occasion and opportunity for it, is accepted with him; a will
   rightly disposed to obey God, though it be not brought into act for
   want of opportunity, does not lose its reward: but when,
   notwithstanding we know not our Lord's will, there are neither of
   these, neither the act nor the preparation and resolution of doing it,
   what punishment may we not expect?

   The just God, in punishing the sins of men, proportions the punishment
   to the crime, and where the crime is greater, the punishment riseth; as
   amongst the Jews, where the crime was small, the malefactor was
   sentenced to a "few stripes," where it was great, he was "beaten with
   many." Thus our Saviour represents the great Judge of the world dealing
   with sinners; according as their sins are aggravated, he will add to
   their punishment. Now after all the aggravations of sin, there is none
   that doth more intrinsically heighten the malignity of it, than when it
   is committed against the clear knowledge of our duty, and that upon
   these three accounts:

   First, Because the knowledge of God's will is so great an fed vantage
   to the doing; of it.

   Secondly, Because it is a great obligation upon us to the doing of it.

   Thirdly, Because the neglect of our duty in this case cannot be without
   a great deal of wilfulness and contempt. I shall speak briefly to these
   three:

   First, Because the knowledge of God's will is so great an advantage to
   the doing of it; and every advantage of doing our duty is a certain
   aggravation of our neglect of it. And this is the reason which our
   Saviour adds here in the text: "For to whom soever much is given, of
   them much will be required; and to whom men have committed much, of him
   they will ask the more." It was, no doubt, a great discouragement and
   disadvantage to the heathens that they were so doubtful concerning the
   will of God, and in many cases left to the uncertainty of their own
   reason, by what way and means they might best apply themselves to the
   pleasing of him; and this discouraged several of the wisest of them
   from all serious endeavours in religion, thinking it as good to do
   nothing as to be mistaken about it. Others, that were more naturally
   devout, and could not satisfy their consciences without some
   expressions of religion, fell into various superstitions, and were
   ready to embrace any way of worship which custom prescribed, or the
   fancies of men could suggest to them: and hence sprang all the stupid
   and barbarous idolatries of the heathen. For ignorance growing upon the
   world, that natural propension which was in the minds of men to
   religion, and the worship of a Deity, for want of certain direction,
   expressed itself in those foolish and abominable idolatries which were
   practised among the heathens.

   And is it not, then, a mighty advantage to us, that we have the clear
   and certain direction of Divine revelation? We have the will of God
   plainly discovered to us, and all the parts of our duty clearly defined
   and determined, so that no man that is in any measure free from
   interest and prejudice, can easily mistake in any great and material
   part of his duty. We have the nature of God plainly revealed to us, and
   such a character of him given, as is most suitable to our natural
   conceptions of a Deity, as render him both awful and amiable; for the
   Scripture represents him to us as great and good, powerful and
   merciful, a perfect hater of sin, and a great lover of mankind, and we
   have the law and manner of his worship (so far as was needful), and the
   rules of a good life clearly expressed and laid down; and as a powerful
   motive and argument to the obedience of those laws, a plain discovery
   made to us of the endless rewards and punishments of another world. And
   is not this a mighty advantage to the doing of God's will, to have it
   so plainly declared to us, and so powerfully enforced upon us? so that
   our duty lies plainly before us; we see what we have to do, and the
   danger of neglecting it; so that, considering the advantage we have of
   doing God's will, by our clear knowledge of it, we are altogether
   inexcusable if we do it not.

   Secondly, The knowledge of our Lord's will is likewise a great
   obligation upon us to the doing of it. For what ought in reason to
   oblige us more to do any thing than to be fully assured that, it is the
   will of God, and that it is the law of the great Sovereign of the
   world, who is able to save or to destroy? That it is the pleasure of
   him that made us, and who hath declared that he designs to make us
   happy by our obedience to his laws? So that if we know these things to
   be the will of God, we have the greatest obligation to do them, whether
   we consider the authority of God, or our own interest; and if we
   neglect them, we have nothing to say in our own excuse. We knew the
   law, and the advantage of keeping it, and the penalty of breaking it;
   and if, after this, we will transgress, there is no apology to be made
   for us. They have something to plead for themselves, who can say, that
   though they had some apprehension of some parts of their duty, and
   their minds were apt to dictate to them that they ought to do some
   things, yet the different apprehensions of mankind about several of
   these things, and the doubts and uncertainties of their own minds
   concerning them, made them easy to be carried off from their duty, by
   the vicious inclinations of their own nature, and the tyranny of custom
   and example, and the pleasant temptations of flesh and blood; but had
   they had a clear and undoubted revelation from God, and had certainly
   known these things to be his will, this would have conquered and borne
   down all objections and temptations to the contrary; or, if it had not,
   would have stopped their mouths, and taken away all excuse from them.
   There is some colour in this plea, that in many cases they did not know
   certainly what the will of God was; but for us who own a clear
   revelation from God, and profess to believe it, what can we say for
   ourselves, to mitigate the severity of God towards us; why he should
   not pour forth all his wrath, and execute upon us the fierceness of his
   anger?

   Thirdly, The neglect of God's will, when we know it, cannot be without
   a great deal of wilfulness and contempt. If we know it, and do it not,
   the fault is solely in our wills, and the more wilful any sin is, the
   more heinously wicked is it. There can hardly be a greater aggravation
   of a crime, than if it proceed from mere obstinacy and perverseness;
   and if we know it to be our Lord's will, and do it not, we are guilty
   of the highest contempt of the greatest authority in the world. And do
   we think this to be but a small aggravation, to affront the great and
   sovereign Judge of the world? not only to break his laws, but to
   trample upon them and despise them, when we know whose laws they are?
   "Will we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?" We
   believe, that it is God who said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery; thou
   shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
   neighbour; thou shalt not hate, or oppress, or defraud thy brother in
   any thing; but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself:" and will we
   notwithstanding venture to break these laws, knowing whose authority
   they are stamped withal? After this contempt of him, what favour can we
   hope for from him? What can we say for ourselves, why any one of those
   many stripes which are threatened should be abated to us? Ignosci
   aliquatenus ignorantia potest; contemptus veniam non habet. "Something
   may be pardoned to ignorance; but contempt can expect no forgiveness."
   He that strikes his prince, not knowing him to be so, hath something to
   say for himself, that though he did a disloyal act, yet it did not
   proceed from a disloyal mind: but he that first acknowledged him for
   his prince, and then affronts him, deserves to be prosecuted with the
   utmost severity, because he did it wilfully, and in mere contempt. The
   knowledge of our duty, and that it is the will of God which we go
   against, takes away all possible excuse from us; for nothing can be
   said, why we should offend him who hath both authority to command us,
   and power to destroy us.

   And thus I have as briefly as I could, represented to you the true
   ground and reason of the aggravation of those sins, which are committed
   against the clear knowledge of God's will, and our duty; because this
   knowledge is so great an advantage to the doing of our duty; so great
   an obligation upon us to it; and because the neglect of our Lord's
   will, in this case, cannot be without great wilfulness, and a downright
   contempt of his authority.

   And shall I now need to tell you, how much it concerns every one of us,
   to live up to that knowledge which we have of our Lord's will, and to
   prepare ourselves to do according to it; to be always in a readiness
   and disposition to do what we know to be his will, and actually to do
   it, when there is occasion and opportunity? And it concerns us the
   more, because we, in this age and nation, have so many advantages above
   a great part of the world, of coming to the knowledge of our duty. We
   enjoy the clearest and most perfect revelation which God ever made of
   his will to mankind, and have the light of Divine truth plentifully
   shed amongst us, by the free use of the Holy Scriptures, which is not a
   sealed book to us, but lies open to be read and studied by us; this
   spiritual food is rained down like manna round about our tents, and
   every one may gather so much as is sufficient: we are not stinted, nor
   have the word of God given out to us in broken pieces, or mixed and
   adulterated--here a lesson of Scripture, and there a legend; but whole
   and entire, sincere and uncorrupt.

   God hath not left us, as he did the heathens for many ages, to the
   imperfect and uncertain direction of natural light: nor hath he
   revealed his will to us, as he did to the Jews, in dark types and
   shadows; but hath made a clear discovery of his mind and will to us.
   The dispensation which we are under hath no veil upon it, "the darkness
   is past, and the true light now shineth; we are of the day, and of the
   light;" and therefore it may justly be expected that we should "put off
   the works of darkness, and walk as children of the light." Every degree
   of knowledge which we have, is an aggravation of the sins committed
   against it, and when our Lord comes to pass sentence upon us, will add
   to the number of our stripes. Nay, if God should inflict no positive
   torment upon sinners, yet their own minds would deal most severely with
   them upon this account, and nothing will gall their consciences more
   than to remember against what light they did offend. For herein lies
   the very nature and sting of all guilt, to be conscious to ourselves,
   that we knew what we ought to have done, and did it not. The vices and
   corruptions which reigned in the world before will be pardonable, in
   comparison of ours. "The times of that ignorance God winked at; but now
   he commands all men every where to repent." Mankind had some excuse for
   their errors before, and God was pleased, in a great measure, to
   overlook them; but "if we continue still in our sins, we have no cloak
   for them." All the degrees of light which we enjoy are so many talents
   committed to us by our Lord, for the improving whereof he will call us
   to a strict account: "for unto whomsoever much is given, of him much
   shall be required; and to whom he hath committed much, of him he will
   ask the more." And nothing is more reasonable, than that men should
   account for all the advantages and opportunities they have had of
   knowing the will of God; and that as their knowledge was increased, so
   their sorrow and punishment should proportionably rise, if they sin
   against it. The ignorance of a great part of the world is deservedly
   pitied and lamented by us; but the condemnation of none is so bad, as
   those who, having the knowledge of God's will, neglect to do it; "how
   much better had it been for them not to have known the way of
   righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy
   commandment delivered unto them!" If we had been born, and brought up
   in ignorance of the true God and his will, we had had no sin, in
   comparison of what now we have: but now that we see, our sin remains.
   This will aggravate our condemnation beyond measure, that we had the
   knowledge of salvation so clearly revealed to us. Our duty lies plainly
   before us; we know what we ought to do, and what manner of persons we
   ought to be, in all holy conversation and godliness. We believe the
   coming of our Lord to judgment, and we know not how soon he may be
   "revealed from heaven with his mighty angels," not only "to take
   vengeance on them that know not God," but on them that have known him,
   and yet obey not the gospel of his Son. And if all this will not move
   us to prepare ourselves to do our Lord's will, we deserve to have our
   stripes multi plied. No condemnation can be too heavy for those who
   offend against the clear knowledge of God's will, and their duty.

   Let us then be persuaded to set upon the practice of what we know; let
   the light which is in our understandings descend upon our hearts and
   lives; let us not dare to continue any longer in the practice of any
   known sin, nor in the neglect of any thing which we are convinced is
   our duty; and if our hearts condemn us not, neither for the neglect of
   the means of knowledge, nor for rebelling against the light of God's
   truth shining in our minds, and glaring upon our consciences, "then
   have we confidence towards God: but if our hearts condemn us, God is
   greater than our hearts, and knows all things."
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CX1V.

  THE SINS OF MEN NOT CHARGEABLE UPON GOD, BUT UPON THEMSELVES.

   Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot
   be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is
   tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.--James i.
   13, 14.

   NEXT to the belief of a God, and his providence, there is nothing more
   fundamentally necessary to the practice of a good life, than the belief
   of these two principles: that God is not the author of sin; and that
   every man's sin lies at his own door, and he hath reason to blame
   himself for all the evil that he does.

   First, That God is not the author of sin, that he is no way accessary
   to our faults, either by tempting or forcing us to the commission of
   them. For if he were, they would neither properly be sins, nor could
   they be justly punished. They would not properly be sins, for sin is a
   contradiction to the will of God; but supposing men to be either
   tempted or necessitated thereto, that which we call sin, would either
   be a mere passive obedience to the will of God, or an active compliance
   with it, but neither way a contradiction to it. Nor could these actions
   be justly punished; for all punishment supposeth a fault, and a fault
   supposeth liberty and freedom from force and necessity; so that no man
   can be justly punished for that which he cannot help, and no man can
   help that which he is necessitated and compelled to. And though there
   were no force in the case, but only temptation, yet it would be
   unreasonable for the same person to tempt and punish. For as nothing is
   more contrary to the holiness of God, than to tempt men to sin; so
   nothing can be more against justice and goodness, than first to draw
   men into a fault, and then to chastise them for it. So that this is a
   principle which lies at the bottom of all religion, that God is not the
   author of the sins of men. And then,

   Secondly, That every man's fault lies at his own door, and he has
   reason enough to blame himself for all the evil that he does. And this
   is that which makes men properly guilty, that when they have done
   amiss, they are conscious to themselves it was their own act, and they
   might have done otherwise; and guilt is that which makes men liable to
   punishment; and fear of punishment is the great restraint from sin, and
   one of the principal arguments for virtue and obedience.

   And both these principles our apostle St. James does here fully assert
   in the words which I have read unto you. "Let no man say when he is
   tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil,
   neither tempteth he any man; but every man is tempted, when he is drawn
   away of his own lust, and enticed."

   In which words these two things are plainly contained:

   First, That God doth not tempt any man to sin. "Let no man say when he
   is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil,
   neither tempteth he any man."

   Secondly, That every man's fault lies at his own door, and he is his
   own greatest tempter. "But every man is tempted, when he his drawn away
   of his own lust, and enticed."

   I. That God doth not tempt any man to sin. "Let no man say when he is
   tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil,
   neither tempteth he any man." In which words there are three things to
   be considered.

   First, The proposition which the apostle here rejects; and that is,
   that God tempts men. "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted
   of God."

   Secondly, The manner in which he rejects it. "Let no man say" so. By
   which manner of speaking, the apostle insinuates these two things:--l.
   That men are apt to lay their faults upon God: for when he says, "Let
   no man say so, he intimates, that men are apt to say so, and it is very
   probable that some did say so; and, 2. That it is not only a fault, but
   an impious assertion, to say that God tempts men. He speaks of it as a
   thing to be rejected with detestation: "Let no man say;" that is, far
   be it from us to affirm a thing so impious and dishonourable to God.

   Thirdly, The reason and argument that he brings against it; "For God
   cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man."

   First, The proposition which the apostle here rejects, and that is,
   that God tempts men: "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted
   of God." Now, that we may the more distinctly understand the meaning of
   the proposition, which the apostle here rejects, it will be very
   requisite to consider what temptation is, and the several sorts and
   kinds of it. To tempt a man, is, in general, nothing else but to make
   trial of him in any kind what he will do. In Scripture, temptation is
   commonly confined to the trial of a man's good or bad, of his virtuous
   or vicious inclinations. But then it is such a trial as endangers a
   man's virtue; and, if he be not well resolved, is likely to overcome
   it, and to make him fall into sin. So that temptation does always imply
   something of danger the worst way. And men are thus tempted, either
   from themselves, or by others; by others, chiefly these two ways:

   First, By direct and downright persuasions to sin.

   Secondly, By being brought into such circumstances as will greatly
   endanger their falling into it, though none solicit and persuade them
   to it.

   First, By direct and downright persuasions to sin. Thus the devil
   tempted our first parents, by representing things so to them, as might
   on the one hand incite them to sin, and on the other hand weaken and
   loosen that which was the great curb and restraint from it. On the one
   hand, he represents to them the advantages they should have by breaking
   God's command: "God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
   eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
   On the other hand, he represents the danger of offending not to be so
   great and certain as they imagined: "The serpent said unto the woman,
   Ye shall not surely die. And the devil had so good success in this way
   of tempting the first Adam, as to encourage him to set upon the second,
   our blessed Saviour, in the same manner; for he would have persuaded
   him to fall down and worship him, by offering him "all the kingdoms of
   the world, and the glory of them." And thus bad men many times tempt
   others, and endeavour to draw them into the same wicked courses with
   themselves. Solomon represents to us the manner and the danger of it:
   (Prov. i. 10, 11. 13, 14.) "My son, if sinners entice thee, consent
   thou not; if they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us
   lurk privily for the innocent without cause; we shall find all precious
   substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: cast in thy lot amongst
   us, let us all have one purse." This is the first way of temptation.

   And to be sure God tempts no man this way. He offers no arguments to
   man to persuade him to sin; he no where proposeth either reward or
   impunity to sinners; but, on the contrary, gives all imaginable
   encouragement to obedience, and threatens the transgression of his law
   with most dreadful punishments.

   Secondly, Men are likewise tempted, by being brought into such
   circumstances, as will greatly en danger their falling into sin, though
   none persuade them to it; and this happens two ways; when men are
   remarkably beset with the allurements of the world, or assaulted with
   the evils and calamities of it; for cither of these conditions are
   great temptations to men, and make powerful assaults upon them,
   especially when they fall upon those who are ill disposed before, or
   are but of a weak virtue and resolution.

   The allurements of the world are strong temptations; riches, honours,
   and pleasures, are the occasions and incentives to many lusts. Honour
   and greatness, power and authority over others, especially when men are
   suddenly lifted up, and from a low condition, are apt to transport men
   to pride and insolency towards others. Power is a strong liquor which
   does easily intoxicate weak minds, and make them apt to say and do
   indecent things. "Man that is in honour and understands not, is like
   the beasts that perish;" intimating, that men who are exalted to a high
   condition, are very apt to forget themselves, and to play the fools and
   beasts. It requires great consideration, and a well-poised mind, not to
   be lifted up with one's condition. Weak heads are apt to turn and grow
   dizzy, when they look down from a great height.

   And so likewise ease and prosperity are a very slippery condition to
   most men, and without great care do endanger the falling into great
   sins. So Solomon observes; (Prov. i. 32.) "For the turning away of the
   simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy
   them." For this reason, Agur maketh his prayer to God, that he would
   give him neither poverty nor riches, but keep him in a mean condition,
   because of the danger of both extremes: (Prov. xxx. 8, 9.) "Give me not
   riches, lest I be full, and deny thee." Both the eager desire and the
   possession and enjoyment of riches do frequently prove fatal to men. So
   our Saviour tells us, else where, very emphatically: (Matt. xix. 23,
   24.) "Verily, I say unto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into
   the kingdom of heaven: and again I say unto you, it is easier for a
   camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter
   into the kingdom of God." St. Paul likewise very fully declares unto us
   the great danger of this condition: (1 Tim. vi. 9, 10.) "But they that
   will be rid), fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish
   and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition; for
   the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted
   after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through
   with many sorrows."

   But the greatest bait of all to flesh and blood, is sensual pleasures;
   the very presence and opportunity of these, are apt to kindle the
   desires, and to in flame the lusts of men, especially where these
   temptations meet with suitable tempers, where every spark that falls
   catcheth.

   And. on the other hand, the evils and calamities of this world,
   especially if they threaten or fall upon men in any degree of
   extremity, are strong temptations to human nature. Poverty and want,
   pain and suffering , and the fear of any great evil, especially of
   death, these are great straits to human nature, and apt to tempt men to
   great sins, to impatience and discontent, to unjust and dishonest
   shifts, to the forsaking of God, and apostacy from his truth and
   religion. Agur was sensible of the dangerous temptation of poverty, and
   therefore he prays against that as well as against riches; "Give me not
   poverty, lest being poor I steal, and take the name of the Lord my God
   in vain;" that is, lest I be tempted to theft and perjury. The devil,
   whose trade it is to tempt men to sin, knew very well the force of
   these sorts of temptations, when he desires God first to touch Job in
   his estate, and to see what effect that would have: (Job i. 11.) "But
   put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse
   thee to thy face." And when he found himself deceived in this, surely
   he thought, that were he but afflicted with great bodily pains, that
   would put him out of all patience, and flesh and blood would not be
   able to withstand this temptation: (chap. ii. 5.) "But put forth thine
   hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to
   thy face." And this was the great temptation that the primitive
   Christians were assaulted withal; they were tempted to forsake Christ
   and his religion, by a most violent persecution, by the spoiling of
   their goods, by imprisonment, and torture, and death. And this is that
   kind of temptation which the apostle particularly speaks of before the
   text: "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he is
   tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised
   to them that love him;" and then it follows, "Let no man say when he is
   tempted, I am tempted of God." And thus I have given an account of the
   several sorts of temptations comprehended under this second head;
   namely, when men are tempted by being brought into such circumstances
   as do greatly endanger their falling into sin, by the allurements of
   this world, and by the evils and calamities of it.

   Now the question is, how far God hath a hand in these kind of
   temptations, that so we may know how to limit this proposition, which
   the apostle here rejects, that men are tempted of God. "Let no man say
   when he is tempted, I am tempted of God."

   That the providence of God does order, or at least permit, men to be
   brought into these circumstances I have spoken of, which are such
   dangerous temptations to sin, no man ran doubt, that believes his
   providence to be concerned in the affairs of the world. All the
   difficulty is, how far the apostle does here intend to exempt God from
   a hand in these temptations. .Now, for the clearer understanding of
   this, it will be requisite to consider the several ends and reasons,
   which those who tempt others may have in tempting them; and all
   temptation is for one of these three ends, or reasons; either for the
   trial and improvement of men's virtues; or by way of judgment and
   punishment for some former great sins and provocations; or with a
   direct purpose and design to seduce men to sin; these I think are the
   chief ends and reasons that can be imagined, of exercising men with
   dangerous temptations.

   First, For the exercise and improvement of men's graces and virtues.
   And this is the end which God always aims at, in bringing good men, or
   permitting them to be brought, into dangerous temptations. And
   therefore St. James speaks of it as a matter of joy, when good men are
   exercised with afflictions; not because afflictions are desirable for
   themselves, but because of the happy consequences of them: (ver. 2, 3.
   of this chapter,) "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into
   divers temptations: knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh
   patience." And to the same purpose St. Paul: (Rom. v. 3-5.) "We glory
   in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience
   experience;" dokime'n; patience trieth a man, and this "trial worketh
   hope, and hope maketh not ashamed." These are happy effects and
   consequences of affliction and suffering, when they improve the virtues
   of men and increase their graces, and thereby make way for the increase
   of their glory. Upon this account, St. James pronounceth those blessed
   who are thus tempted. "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for
   when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord
   hath promised to them that love him."

   And this certainly is no disparagement to the providence of God, to
   permit men to be thus tempted, when he permits it for no other end but
   to make them better men, and thereby to prepare them for a greater
   reward: and so the apostle assures us, (Rom. viii. 17, 18.) "If so be
   we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him; for I reckon
   that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared
   with the glory that shall be revealed in us." And, (ver. 28.) "For we
   know that all things shall work together for good to them that love
   God." And this happy end and issue of temptations to good men the
   providence of God secures to them (if they be not wanting to
   themselves) one of these two ways; either by proportioning the
   temptation to their strength; or, if it exceed that, by ministering new
   strength and support to them, by the secret and extraordinary aids of
   his Holy Spirit.

   First, By proportioning the temptation to their strength; ordering
   things so by his secret and wise providence, that they shall not be
   assaulted by any temptation, which is beyond their strength to resist
   and overcome. And herein the security of good men doth ordinarily
   consist; and the very best of us, those who have the firmest and most
   resolute virtue, were in infinite danger, if the providence of God did
   not take this care of us. For a temptation may set upon the best men
   with so much violence, or surprise them at such an advantage, as no
   ordinary degree of grace and virtue is able to withstand: but where men
   are sincerely good, and honestly resolved, the providence of God doth
   ward off these fierce blows, and put by these violent thrusts, and by a
   secret disposal of things, keep them from being assaulted by these
   irresistible kinds of temptations.

   The consideration whereof, as it is a great encouragement to men to be
   sincerely good, so likewise a great argument for a continual dependance
   upon the providence of God, and to take us off from confidence in
   ourselves, and our own strength. And this use the apostle makes of it:
   (1 Cor. x. 12.) "Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth, (that is,
   confident that nothing shall be able to shake him, or throw him down)
   take heed lest he fall; there hath no temptation taken yon, but such as
   is common to men;" ei me anthropinos, but what is human; nothing but
   what a human strength, assisted by an ordinary grace of God, may be
   able to resist and conquer. But there are greater and more violent
   temptations than these, which you have not yet been tried with; and
   when those happen, we must have recourse to God for an extraordinary
   assistance. And this is the

   Second way I mentioned, whereby the providence of God does secure good
   men in case of extraordinary temptations, which no human strength can
   probably resist. And this the same apostle assures us of in the very
   next words: "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted
   above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make a way
   to escape, that you may be able to bear it." That is, in case of great
   and violent temptations (such as the Christians in the height of their
   persecutions were exposed to), God will secretly minister strength and
   support equal to the force and power of the temptation. And this God
   did in an extraordinary manner to the Christian martyrs, and that to
   such a degree, as made them joyfully to embrace their sufferings, and
   with the greatest cheerfulness in the world to endure those torments,
   which no human patience was able to bear. And where God doth thus
   secure men against temptations, or support them under them, it is no
   reflection at all upon the goodness or justice of his providence, to
   permit them to be thus tempted.

   Secondly, God permits others to be thus tempted, by way of judgment and
   punishment, for some former great sins and provocations which they have
   been guilty of. And thus many times God punisheth great and notorious
   offenders, by permitting them to fall into great temptations, which,
   meeting with a vicious deposition, are likely to be too hard for them,
   especially considering how by a long habit of wickedness, and wilful
   commission of great and notorious sins, they have made themselves an
   easy prey to every temptation, and have driven the Spirit of God from
   them, and deprived themselves of those aids and restraints of his
   grace, which he ordinarily affords, not only to good men, but likewise
   to those who are not very bad. And thus God is said to have hardened
   Pharaoh by those plagues and judgments which he sent upon him and his
   king dom. But if we carefully read the story, it is said that he first
   hardened himself, and then that God hardened him; that is, he being
   hardened under the first judgments of God, God sent more, which,
   meeting with his obstinacy, had this natural effect upon him, to harden
   him yet more; not that God did infuse any wickedness or obstinacy into
   him, but by his just judgments sent more plagues upon him, which
   hardened him yet more, and which were likely to have that effect upon
   him, considering the ill temper of the man. And it was just by way of
   punishment that they should. And so likewise, (Joshua xi. 19, 20.) it
   is said that, the cities of the Canaanites did not make peace with
   Joshua, because "it was of the Lord to harden their hearts. that they
   should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them
   utterly;" that is, for their former iniquities, the measure whereof was
   now full, the providence of God did justly bring them into, and leave
   them under, those circumstances, which made them obstinate against all
   terms of peace; and this proved fatal to them.

   And in the like sense we are to understand several other expressions in
   Scripture, which likewise might seem very harsh. As, (Isaiah vi. 10.)
   "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut
   their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,
   and understand with their hearts, and convert and be healed;" all which
   expressions signify no more, but that God, for the former provocations
   and impenitency of that people, did leave them to their own hardness
   and blindness, so that they did not desire to understand and make use
   of the means of their recovery. So likewise, (Rom. i. 24.) God is said
   to have given up the idolatrous heathen "to uncleanness, to vile and
   unnatural lusts;" and, (ver. 28.) "to a reprobate and injudicious
   mind;" that is, as a punishment of their idolatry, he left them to the
   power of those temptations, which betrayed them to the vilest lusts.
   And to mention but one text more, (2 Thess. ii. 11.) the apostle
   threatens those that rejected the truth, that "for this cause God would
   send them strong delusions (the efficacy of error), that they should
   believe a lie, and that they all might be damned who believed not the
   truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness;" that is, as a just
   punishment for their renouncing the truth, God gave them over to the
   power of delusion; their error had its full scope at them, to tempt
   them with all its colours and pretences.

   But it is observable, that, in all these places which I have mentioned,
   God is said to give men up to the power of temptation, as a punishment
   of some former great crimes and provocations. And it is not unjust with
   God thus to deal with men, to leave them to the power of temptation,
   when they had first wilfully forsaken him; and in this case God doth
   not tempt men to sin, but leaves them to themselves, to be tempted by
   their own hearts lusts; and if they yield and are conquered, it is
   their own fault, because they have neglected God's grace, whereby they
   might have been able to have resisted those temptations; and have
   forced his Holy Spirit to with draw himself from them, and to leave
   them open and naked to those assaults of temptation, against which they
   might otherwise have been sufficiently armed.

   Thirdly, The last end of temptation which I mentioned, is to try men,
   with a direct purpose and intention to seduce men to sin. Thus wicked
   men tempt others, and thus the devil tempts men. Thus he tempted our
   first parents, and seduced them from their obedience and allegiance to
   God. Thus he tempted Job, by bringing him into those circumstances,
   which were very likely to have forced him into impatience and
   discontent. And thus he tempted our blessed Saviour: but found nothing
   in him to work upon, or to give him any advantage over him. And thus he
   daily tempts men, by laying all sorts of baits and snares before them,
   going about continually, seeking whom he may seduce and destroy; and as
   far as God permits him, and his power reacheth, he suits his
   temptations as near as he can to the humours, and appetites, and
   inclinations of men, contriving them into such circumstances, as that
   he may ply his temptations upon them to the greatest advantage:
   propounding such objects to them, as may most probably draw forth the
   corruptions of men, and kindle their irregular desires, and inflame
   their lusts, and tempt their evil inclinations that way, which they are
   most strongly bent. He tempts the covetous man with gain, the ambitious
   man with preferment, the voluptuous man with carnal and sensual
   pleasures; and, where none of these baits will take, he stirs up his
   instruments to persecute those who are steadfast and confirmed in
   resolutions of piety and virtue, to try if he can work upon their fear,
   and shake their constancy and fidelity to God and goodness, that way;
   and all this he doth with a direct design and earnest desire to seduce
   men from their duty, and to betray them to sin.

   But thus God tempts no man; and in this sense it is that the apostle
   means that "no man when he is tempted, is tempted of God." God hath no
   design to seduce any man to sin. He often proves the obedience of men,
   and suffers them to fall into divers temptations, for the trial of
   their faith, and exercise of their obedience and other virtues; and he
   permits bad men to be assaulted with great temptations, and, as a
   punishment of their former obstinacy and impiety, withdraws the aids
   and assistances of his grace from them, and leaves them to their own
   weakness and folly; but not so as to take away all restraint of his
   grace even from bad men, unless it be upon very high provocation, and a
   long and obstinate continuance in sin: but God never tempts any man,
   with any intention to seduce him to sin, and with a desire he should do
   wickedly. This is the proper work of the devil and his instruments; in
   this sense it is far from God to tempt any man; and whenever, in the
   ordinary course, and by the common permission of his providence, men
   fall into temptation, the utmost that God does, is to leave them to
   themselves; and he does not do this neither, but to those who have
   highly provoked him to depart from them; that is, to those who have
   justly deserved to be so dealt withal.

   And thus I have considered the proposition which the apostle here
   rejects; namely, that God tempts men; and have shewn, as clearly as I
   can, how it is to be limited and understood. I now proceed to the
   second thing which I propounded to consider; viz. the manner in which
   the apostle rejects this proposition, "Let no man say, when he is
   tempted, I am tempted of God." By which manner of speaking, he
   insinuates two things.

   First, That men are apt to lay their faults upon God. For when he says,
   "Let no man say" so, he intimates that men were apt to say thus; and it
   is probable some did say so, to excuse themselves for their deserting
   their religion upon the temptation of persecution and suffering. It is
   not unlikely that men might lay the fault upon God's providence, which
   exposed them to these difficult trials, and thereby tempted them to
   forsake their religion.

   But however this be, we find it very natural to men, to transfer their
   faults upon others. Men are naturally sensible when they offend, and do
   contrary to their duty; and the guilt of sin is a heavy burden, of
   which men would be glad to ease themselves as much as they can; and
   they think it is a mitigation and excuse of their faults, if they did
   not proceed only from themselves, but from the violence and compulsion,
   the temptation and instigation, of others. But, especially, men are
   very glad to lay their faults upon God, because he is a full and
   sufficient excuse, nothing being to be blamed that comes from him. Thus
   Adam did, upon the commission of the very first sin that mankind was
   guilty of When God charged him for breaking of his law, by eating of
   the fruit of the forbidden tree, he endeavours to excuse himself by
   laying the fault obliquely upon God; "The woman whom thou gavest to be
   with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat." "The woman whom thou
   gavest to be with me;" he does what he can to derive the fault upon
   God. And though this be very unreasonable, yet it seems it is very
   natural. Men would fain have the pleasure of committing sin, but then
   they would be glad to remove as much of the trouble and guilt of it
   from themselves as they can.

   Secondly, This manner of speech, which the apostle here useth, doth
   insinuate further to us, that it is not only a false, but an impious
   assertion, to say that God tempts men to sin. He speaks of it, not only
   as a thing unfit to be said, but fit to be rejected with the greatest
   indignation; "Let no man say," that is, far it be from us to affirm any
   thing so impious and so dishonourable to God. For no thing can be more
   contrary to the holy and righteous nature of God, and to those plain
   declarations which he hath made of himself, than to seduce men to
   wickedness; and therefore no man, that hath any regard to the honour of
   God, can entertain the least suspicion of his having any hand in the
   sins of men, or give heed to any principles or doctrines, from whence
   so odious and abominable a consequence may be drawn. I proceed to the

   Third thing I propounded to consider; namely, The reason or argument
   which the apostle brings against this impious suggestion; that "God can
   not be tempted with evil;" and therefore no man can imagine that he
   should tempt any man to it; "Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am
   tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth
   he any man." And in speaking to this, I shall,

   First, Consider the strength and force of this argument: and,

   Secondly, The nature and kind of it.

   First, The strength and force of this argument, "God cannot be tempted
   with evil, neither tempteth he any man;" apei'rasto's esti kakon; he is
   untemptible by evil; he cannot be drawn to any thing that is bad
   himself, and therefore it cannot be imagined he should have any
   inclination or design to seduce others. And this will appear to be a
   strong and forcible argument, if we consider,

   First, The proposition upon which it is grounded, that "God cannot be
   tempted by evil."

   Secondly, The consequence that clearly follows from it; and that is,
   that because God cannot be tempted by evil, therefore he cannot tempt
   any man to it.

   First, We will consider the proposition upon which this argument is
   built, and that is, that "God cannot be tempted by evil." He is out of
   the reach of any temptation to evil. Whoever is tempted to any thing,
   is either tempted by his own inclination, or by the allurement of the
   object, or by some external motive and consideration: but none of all
   these can be imagined to have any place in God, to tempt him to evil.

   For, first, he hath no temptation to it from his own inclination. The
   holy and pure nature of God is at the greatest distance from evil, and
   at the greatest contrariety to it. He is so far from having any
   inclination to evil, that it is the only thing in the world to which he
   hath an irreconcilable antipathy. This the Scripture frequently
   declares to us, and that in a very emphatical manner: (Psal. v. 4.) "He
   is not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell
   with him." The words are a diminution, and less is said than is
   intended by them; the meaning is, that God is so far from taking
   pleasure in sin, that he hath a perfect hatred and abhorrence of it:
   (Hab. i. 12.) "Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst
   not look upon iniquity." As when men hate a thing to the highest
   degree, they turn away their eyes, and can not endure to look upon it.
   Light and darkness are not more opposite to one another, than the holy
   nature of God is to sin. "What fellowship hath light with darkness, or
   God with Belial?"

   Secondly, There is no allurement in the object, to stir up any
   inclination to him towards it. Sin in its very nature is imperfection,
   and irregularity, crookedness, and deformity; so that, unless there be
   an inclination to it beforehand, there is nothing in it to move any
   one's liking or desire towards it; it hath no attractives or
   enticements in it, but to a corrupt and ill-disposed mind.

   Thirdly, Neither are there external motives and considerations, that
   can be imagined to tempt God to it. All arguments that have any
   temptation, are either founded in hope or fear; either in the hope of
   gaining some benefit or advantage, or in the fear of falling into some
   mischief or inconvenience. Now the Divine Nature, being perfectly
   happy, and perfectly secured in its own happiness, is out of the reach
   of any of these temptations. Men are many times tempted to evil very
   strongly by these considerations: they want many things to make them
   happy, and they fear many things which may make them miserable; and the
   hopes of the one and the fears of the other, are apt to work very
   powerfully upon them, to seduce them from their duty, and to draw them
   to sin: but the Divine Nature is firm against all these attempts, by
   its own fulness and security. So that you see now the proposition, upon
   which the apostle grounds his argument, is evidently true, and beyond
   all exception, that "God cannot be tempted with evil." Let us then, in
   the

   Second place, Consider the consequence that clearly follows from it,
   that because God cannot be tempted with evil, therefore he cannot tempt
   any man to it. For why should he desire to draw men into that which he
   himself abhors, and which is so contrary to his own nature and
   disposition? When men tempt one another to sin, they do it to make
   others like themselves; and when the devil tempts men to sin, it is
   either out of direct malice to God, or out of envy to men. But none of
   these considerations can have any place in God, or be any motive to him
   to tempt men to sin.

   Bad men tempt others to sin, to make them like themselves, and that
   with one of these two designs; either for the comfort or pleasure of
   company, or for the countenance of it, that there may be some kind of
   apology and excuse for them.

   For the comfort and pleasure of company. Man does not love to be alone;
   and for this reason bad men endeavour to make others like themselves,
   that, agreeing with them in the same disposition and manners, they may
   be fit company for them. For no man takes pleasure in the society and
   conversation of those, who are of contrary tempers and inclinations to
   them, because they are continually warring and clashing with one
   another. And for this reason bad men hate and persecute those that are
   good. "Let us lie in wait (say they) for the righteous, because he is
   not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings; he is grievous unto
   us even to behold; for his life is not like other men's, and his ways
   are of another fashion;" as it is expressed in the Wisdom of Solomon.
   So that wicked men tempt others to sin, that they may have the pleasure
   and contentment of their society. But now, for this reason, God cannot
   be imagined to tempt men to sin, because that would be the way to make
   them unlike himself, and such as his soul could take no pleasure in.

   Another design that bad men have in seducing others to sin, is thereby
   to give countenance to their bad actions, and to be some kind of excuse
   and apology for them. Among men, the multitude of offenders does
   sometimes procure impunity, but it always gives countenance to vice;
   and men are apt to allege it in their excuse, that they are not alone
   guilty of such a fault--that they did not do it without company and
   example; which is the reason of that law, (Exod. xxiii. 2.) "Thou shalt
   not follow a multitude to do evil;" implying, that men are very apt to
   take encouragement to any thing that is bad, from company and example.
   But neither hath this reason any place in God, who, being far from
   doing evil himself, can have no reason to tempt others to do so, by way
   of excuse and vindication of himself.

   And when the devil tempts men to sin, it is either out of direct malice
   to God, or out of envy to men. Out of malice to God, to spoil his
   workmanship, and to pervert that which came innocent and upright out of
   his hands; to rob God of his subjects, and to debauch them from their
   duty and allegiance to him; to strengthen the rebellion which he has
   raised against God, and to make him as many enemies as he can. But for
   this end God cannot tempt any man; for this would be to procure
   dishonour to himself, and to deface the work of his own hands.

   Another reason why the devil tempts men is envy. When he was fallen
   from God and happiness, and by his own rebellion had made himself
   miserable, he was discontented to see the happy condition of man, and
   it grieved him at his very heart; and this moved him to tempt man to
   sin, that he might involve him in the same misery into which he had
   plunged himself. It is a pleasure to envy to overturn the happiness of
   others, and to lay them level with themselves. But the Divine nature is
   full of goodness, and delights in the happiness of all his creatures.
   His own incomparable felicity has placed him as much above any
   temptation to envying others, as above any occasion of being contemned
   by them. He grudges no man's happiness, and therefore can not tempt men
   to sin, out of a desire to see them miserable. So that none of those
   considerations which move the devil to tempt men to sin, and evil men
   to tempt one another to do wickedly, can be imagined to have any place
   in God.

   And thus you see the force of the apostle's argument, that because "God
   cannot be tempted to evil," therefore he can tempt no man. None tempt
   others to be bad, but those who are first so themselves. I shall now,
   in the

   Second place, Consider the nature and kind of the argument which the
   apostle here useth: "Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted
   of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any
   man." He does not reject this impious proposition barely upon his own
   authority; but he argues against it from the nature and perfection of
   God; and therein appeals to the common notions of mankind concerning
   God. We might very well have rested in his authority, being an apostle
   commissioned by our Saviour, and extraordinarily assisted and witnessed
   to, by the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost, wherewith he was
   endowed: but he condescends to give a reason of what he says, and
   appeals to the common principles of mankind. For all men will readily
   agree to this, that God hath all imaginable perfection: but it is a
   plain imperfection to be liable to be tempted to evil, and therefore,
   "God cannot be tempted to evil." And, if so, it is as impossible that
   he should tempt others to it; for none can have either an inclination
   or interest to seduce others to evil, but those who have been first
   seduced to it themselves.

   Now, in this method of arguing, the apostle teacheth us one of the
   surest ways of reasoning in religion; namely, from the natural notions
   which men have of God. So that all doctrines plainly contrary to those
   natural notions which men have of God are to be rejected, what
   authority soever they pretend to; whatever plainly derogates from the
   goodness or justice of God, or any other of his perfections, is
   certainly false, what authority soever it may claim from the judgment
   of learned and pious men; yea, though it pretend to be countenanced
   from the texts and expressions of Holy Scripture: because nothing can
   be entertained as a Divine revelation, which plainly contradicts the
   common natural notions which mankind have of God. For all reasoning
   about Divine revelation, and whether that which pretends to he so be
   really so or not, is to be governed by those natural notions. And if
   any thing that pretends to be a revelation from God, should teach men
   that there is no God, or that he is not wise, and good, and just, and
   powerful; this is reason enough to reject it, how confident soever the
   pretence be, that it is a Divine revelation.

   And if any thing be, upon good groundsill reason, received for a Divine
   revelation (as the Holy Scriptures are amongst Christians), no man
   ought to be regarded, who from thence pretends to maintain any doctrine
   contrary to the natural notions which men have of God; such as clearly
   contradict his holiness, or goodness, or justice, or do, by plain and
   undeniable consequence, make God the author of sin, or the like;
   because the very attempt to prove any such thing out of Scripture, does
   strike at the Divine authority of those books. For if they be from God,
   it is certain they can contain no such thing. So that no man ought to
   suffer himself to be seduced into any such opinions, upon pretence that
   there are expressions in Scripture which seem to countenance them. For
   if they really did so, the consequence would not be the confirming of
   such opinions, but the weakening of the authority of the Scripture
   itself. For just so many arguments as any man can draw from Scripture
   for any such opinion, so many weapons he puts into the hands of
   atheists inst the Scripture itself.

   I do not speak this as if I thought there were any ground from
   Scripture for any such doctrine; I am very certain there is not. And if
   there be any particular expression, which to prejudiced men may seem to
   import any such thing, every man ought to govern himself in the
   interpretation of such passages, by what is clear and plain, and
   agreeable to the main scope and tenor of the Bible, and to those
   natural notions which men have of God, and of his perfections. For when
   all is done, this is one of the surest ways of reasoning in religion;
   and whoever guides himself, and steers by this compass, can never err
   much: but whoever suffers himself to be led away by the appearance of
   some more obscure phrases in the expressions of Scripture, and the
   glosses of men upon them, without regard to this rule, may run into the
   greatest delusions, may wander eternally, and lose himself in one
   mistake after another, and shall never find his way out of this endless
   labyrinth, but by this clue.

   If St. James had not been an apostle, the argument which he useth would
   have convinced any reasonable man, that God tempts no man to sin,
   because he "cannot be tempted with evil" himself; and therefore it is
   unreasonable to imagine he should tempt any man. For he argues from
   such a principle, as all mankind will, at first hearing, as sent to.

   And thus I have done with the first thing asserted by the apostle here
   in the text, that God tempts no man to sin; "Let no man say, when he is
   tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted of evil,
   neither tempteth he any man." Before I proceed to the second assertion,
   that every man is his own greatest tempter, I should draw some useful
   inferences from what has been already delivered: but I reserve both the
   one and the other to the next opportunity.

SERMON CXV.

  THE SINS OF MEN NOT CHARGEABLE UPON GOD, BUT UPON THEMSELVES.

   Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot
   be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is
   tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.--James i.
   13, 14.

   WHEN I made entrance upon these words, I told you, that, next to the
   belief of a God and a providence, nothing is more fundamentally
   necessary to the practice of a good life than the belief of these two
   principles--That God is not the author of the sins of men; and that
   every man's fault lies at his own door. And both these principles St.
   James does clearly and fully assert in these words.

   First, God tempts no man to sin.

   Secondly, Every man is his own greatest tempter.

   The first of these I have largely spoken to in my former discourse; and
   from what I then said, I shall only draw a few useful inferences,
   before I proceed to the second; viz. these which follow.

   First, Let us beware of all such doctrines as do any ways tend to make
   God the author of sin; either by laying a necessity upon men of
   sinning, or by laying secret designs to tempt and seduce men to sin.
   Nothing can be farther from the nature of God than to do any such
   thing, and nothing can be more dishonourable to him than to imagine any
   such thing of him; "he is of purer eyes than to be hold evil;" and can
   we think, that he who cannot endure to see it should have any hand in
   it? We find that the holy men in Scripture are very careful to remove
   all thought and suspicion of this from God. Elihu, (Job xxxvi. 3.)
   before he would argue about God's providence with Job, he resolves, in
   the first place, to attribute nothing to God that is unworthy of him.
   "I will (says he,) ascribe righteousness to my Maker." So likewise St.
   Paul, (Rom. vii. 7.) "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God
   forbid." "Is the law sin?" that is, hath God given men a law to this
   end, that he might draw them into sin? Far be it from him. (Gal. ii.
   17.) "Is Christ the minister of sin? God forbid."

   You see then how tender good men have always been of ascribing any
   thing to God, that might seem to render him the author of sin. So that
   we have reason to take heed of all doctrines that are of this tendency:
   such as are the doctrines of an absolute and irrespective decree to
   damn the greatest part of mankind; and in order to that, and as a means
   to it, efficaciously to permit men to sin. For if these things be true,
   that God hath absolutely decreed to damn the greatest part of men; and,
   to make good this decree, he permits them to sin, not by a bare
   permission of leaving them to themselves, but by such a permission as
   shall be efficacious; that is, he will so permit them to sin as they
   cannot avoid it: then those who are under this decree of God are under
   a necessity of sinning, which necessity, since it does not proceed from
   themselves, but from the decree of God, does by consequence make God
   the author of sin. And then that other doctrine, which is subservient
   to this, that God does, by a physical and natural influence upon the
   minds and wills of men, determine them to every action that they do, to
   bad actions as well ns good. I know they who say so tell us, that God
   only determines men to the action, but not to the evil of it. For in
   stance, when Cain killed his brother, God deter mined him (they say) to
   the natural action of taking away a man's life, which in many cases may
   be done without sin. Very true: but if in these circumstances the
   natural action could not be done with out committing the sin, he that
   determined him to the natural action determined him likewise to the
   sin.

   I am far from any thought that those that maintain these doctrines had
   any intention to make God the author of sin: but if this be the
   necessary consequence of these doctrines, there is reason enough to
   reject them, how innocent soever the intention be of those who maintain
   them.

   Secondly, Let not us tempt any man to sin. All piety pretends to be an
   imitation of God; therefore let us endeavour to be like him in this. It
   is true, indeed, we may be tempted with evil, and therefore we are
   likely enough to tempt others: but we ought not to do so. It is
   contrary to holiness and goodness, to the temper and disposition of the
   most perfect Being in the world. God tempts no man; nay, it is the
   proper work and employment of the devil, it is his very trade and
   profession: he goes about seeking whom he may betray into sin and
   destruction. To this end he walks up and down the earth, waiting all
   opportunities and advantages upon men to draw them into sin: so that we
   are his factors and instruments whenever we tempt men to sin.

   Let those consider this, who are so active and busy to seduce men into
   any kind of wickedness, and to instruct them in the arts of iniquity;
   how tempt men into bad company and courses, and take pleasure in
   debauching a virtuous person, and make it matter of great triumph to
   make a sober man drunk; as if it were so glorious an action to ruin a
   soul, and destroy that which is more worth than the whole world.
   Whenever you go about this work remember whose instruments you are, and
   whose work you do, and what kind of work it is. Tempting others to sin
   is in Scripture called murder; for which reason the devil is said to be
   "a murderer from the beginning," because he was a tempter. "Whosoever
   committeth sin is of the devil;" but whosoever tempts others to sin is
   a sort of devil himself.

   Thirdly, Since God tempts no man, let us not tempt him. There is
   frequent mention in Scripture of men's tempting God; i. e. trying him,
   as it were, whether he will do any thing for their sakes, that is
   misbecoming his goodness, and wisdom, and faithfulness, or any other of
   his perfections. Thus the Israelites are said to have "tempted God in
   the wilderness forty years together," and, in that space, more
   remarkably ten times. The meaning of which expressions is, that when
   God had promised Abraham to bring his seed into the land of Canaan,
   that people, by their great and repeated provocations of God, did often
   provoke him to have destroyed them, and consequently to have failed of
   the promise which he made to the fathers. The devil likewise tempted
   our Saviour to tempt God, by casting himself down from the pinnacle of
   the temple, in confidence that the angels would take care of him: but
   our Saviour answers him, "It is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
   thy God." From which instance it appears, that men are said to tempt
   God, whenever they expect the protection of his providence in an
   unwarrantable way. God hath promised to take care of good men, but if
   they neglect themselves or willingly cast themselves into danger, and
   expect his providence and protection, they do not trust God, but tempt
   him; they try whether God's providence will countenance their rashness,
   and provide for them, when they neglect themselves; and protect them
   from those dangers to which they wilfully expose themselves.

   So likewise if we be negligent in our callings, whereby we should
   provide for our families, if we lavish away that which we should lay up
   for them, and then depend upon the providence of God to supply them,
   and take care of them, we tempt God to that which is unworthy of him;
   which is to give approbation to our folly, and countenance our sloth
   and carelessness. We cannot seduce God, and draw him to do any thing
   that misbecomes him, but we tempt him in expecting the care and
   protection of his providence, when we wilfully run ourselves into
   danger, and neglect the means of providing for our own safety. And thus
   I have done with the first great principle contained in the text; viz.
   That God is not the author of the sins of men. I proceed now to the

   Second; That every man is his own greatest tempter. "But every man is
   tempted, when he is drawn aside of his own lust, and enticed." God does
   not tempt, any man to sin: but every man is then tempted, when by his
   own lust, his irregular inclination and desire, he is seduced to evil,
   and enticed; kai` deleazo'menos, is caught, as it were, with a bait,
   for so the Greek word signifies.

   In which words the apostle gives us a true account of the prevalency
   and efficacy of temptation upon men. It is not because God has any
   design to ensnare men in sin; but their own corruption and vicious
   inclinations seduce them to that which is evil. To instance in the
   particular temptations the apostle was speaking of, persecution and
   suffering for the cause of religion, to avoid which, many did then
   forsake the truth, and apostatize from their Christian profession. The
   true case of which was not the providence of God, which permitted them
   to be exposed to those sufferings, but their inordinate love of the
   good things of this life, and their unreasonable fears of the evils and
   sufferings of it; they valued the enjoyments of this present life, more
   than the favour of God, and that eternal happiness which Ire had
   promised to them in another life; and they feared the persecutions of
   men more than the threatenings of God, and the dreadful punishments of
   another world. They had an inordinate affection for the ease and
   pleasure of this life, and their unwillingness to part with these, was
   a great temptation to them to quit their religion; by this bait they
   were caught, when it came to the trial.

   And thus it is proportionably in all other sorts of temptations. Men
   are betrayed by themselves, and the temptation without hath a party
   within them, with which it holds a secret correspondence, and which is
   ready to yield and give consent to it; so that it is our own consent,
   and treachery to ourselves, that makes any temptation master of us, and
   without that we are not to be overcome; "every man w tempted, when he
   is drawn aside of his own lust, and enticed." It is the lust of men
   complying with the temptations which are offered to us, which renders
   them effectual, and gives them the victory over us.

   In the handling of this argument, I shall from these words of the
   apostle observe to you these two things.

   First, That as the apostle doth here acquit God from any hand in
   tempting men to sin, so he does not ascribe the prevalency of
   temptation to the devil.

   Secondly, That he ascribes the prevalency of temptation to the lust and
   vicious inclinations of men, which seduce them to a compliance with the
   temptations that are presented to them; "every man is tempted, when he
   is drawn aside of his own lust, and enticed." These two observations
   shall be the subject of my present discourse.

   First, That as the apostle doth here acquit God from any hand in
   tempting men to sin, so he does not ascribe the prevalency and efficacy
   of temptation to the devil. That he acquits God, I have shewn, at
   large, in my former discourse. It is evident, likewise, that he does
   not ascribe the efficacy and prevalency of temptation to the devil: for
   the apostle in this discourse of his concerning temptations, makes no
   express mention of the devil; he supposeth, indeed, that baits are laid
   for men, "every man is tempted, when he is drawn aside of his own lust,
   and enticed;" i. e. when he plays with the baits that are laid for him,
   and swallows them. And the Scripture elsewhere frequently tells us,
   that the devil is very active and busy to tempt men, and is continually
   laying baits before them; but their own lusts are the cause why they
   are caught by them.

   And I do the rather insist upon this, because men are apt to lay great
   load upon the devil, in the business of temptation, hoping thereby
   either wholly, or at least in a great measure, to excuse themselves;
   and therefore I shall here consider how far the devil by his
   temptations is the cause of the sins which men, by compliance with
   those temptations, are drawn into.

   First, It is certain that the devil is very active and busy to minister
   to them the occasion of sin, and temptations to it. For ever since he
   fell from God, partly out of enmity to him, and partly out of envy and
   malice to mankind, he hath made it his great business and employment to
   seduce men to sin; and to this end he walks up and down the earth, and
   watcheth all occasions and opportunities to tempt men to sin; and so
   far as his power reacheth, and God permits him, he lays baits and
   temptations before them in all their ways, presenting them with the
   occasions and opportunities to sin, and with such baits and allurements
   as are most suitable to their tempers, and most likely to prevail with
   their particular inclinations, and, as often as he can, surprising men
   with these at the easiest time of access, and with such circumstances,
   as may give his temptations the greatest force and advantage. Of this
   the Scripture assures us in general, when it tells us of those wiles
   and devices of Satan, and of the methods of his temptations; so that
   though we do not particularly discern how and when he doth this, yet we
   have no reason to doubt of the thing, if we believe that there is such
   a spirit in the world, as the Scripture particularly tells us there is,
   that works in the children of disobedience; and that God, from whom
   nothing is hid, and who sees all the secret engines which are at work
   in the world, to do us good or harm, hath in mercy to mankind given us
   particular warning of it, and that we may not be wholly ignorant of our
   enemies, and their malicious designs upon us, that we may be
   continually upon our guard, aware of our danger, and armed against it.

   Secondly, The devil does not only present to men the temptations and
   occasions of sin; but when he is permitted to make nearer approaches to
   them, does excite and stir them up to comply with these temptations,
   and to yield to them. And this he does, not only by employing his
   instruments, to solicit for him, and draw men to sin by bad counsel and
   example, which we see frequently done, and probably very often by the
   devil's instigation; (those who are very wicked themselves, and
   consequently more enslaved to the devil, and under his power, being as
   it were factors for him to seduce others;) but besides this it is not
   improbable but the devil himself does many times immediately excite men
   to sin, by working upon the humours of their bodies, or upon their
   imaginations; and by that means in fusing and suggesting evil motions
   into them; or by diverting them from those thoughts and considerations,
   which might check and restrain them from that wickedness to which he is
   tempting them; or by some other ways and means more secret and unknown
   to us. For the power of spirits, whether good or bad, and the manner of
   their operation upon our minds, are things very secret, and of which we
   can give little or no account; but yet for all that, we have many times
   reason sufficient to believe a thing to be so, when we are wholly
   ignorant of the manner of it.

   And there is reason, from what is said in Scripture, to believe that
   the devil, in some cases, hath a more immediate power and influence
   upon the minds of men, to excite them to sin, and, where he discovers a
   very bad inclination or resolution, to help it forward, and to keep men
   to it; as when it is said, (John xiii. 27.) that "the devil entered
   into Judas," to push him on in that ill design, which he had al ready
   engaged in, of betraying our Saviour. And (Acts v. 3.) Satan is said to
   have "filled the heart of Ananias, to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to
   keep back part of the price" for which he had sold his estate; which
   expressions do seem to intimate to us, some more immediate power and
   influence which the devil had upon those persons: but then it is very
   observable, that this power is never ascribed to the devil, but in the
   case of great and horrid sins, and where men are beforehand notoriously
   depraved; and either by the actual commission of some former great sin,
   or by entertaining some very wicked design, have provoked God to permit
   the devil a nearer access to them. For Judas had first taken counsel
   how to betray Christ, before it is said the devil entered into him, to
   push him on to the execution of it. And Ananias's covetousness had
   first tempted him to keep back part of his estate, before it is said
   the devil filled his heart to lie to the Holy Ghost; so that what power
   the devil hath over men, they first give it him; they consent to his
   outward temptations, before he can get within thorn. Hence it is that
   in Scripture great sinners are described, as being more immediately
   under the government and influence of the devil. Ephes. ii. 1, 2. where
   the apostle speaking of those, who from heathenism were converted to
   Christianity, "You (says he) hath he quickened, who were once dead in
   trespasses and sins; wherein in times past ye walked, according to the
   course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air,
   the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience, or
   unbelief;" tou pneumatos tou nun energountos, "the spirit that still
   acts and inspires the children of unbelief;" that is, those continue in
   their infidelity, and would not believe and obey the gospel. When men
   are notoriously wicked and disobedient to the counsels of God, the
   devil is said to act and inspire them, which certainly signifies some
   more immediate power and influence which he hath over such persons.

   For as it is very probable, that the devil is some times permitted to
   come near good men so as to tempt them; so, by notorious wickedness and
   impiety, men do give admission to him, and he is permitted by the just
   judgment of God to exercise greater dominion over them. By resisting
   his temptations, we drive him from us. So St. James tells us, (chap.
   iv. 7.) "Resist the devil, and he will flee from yon: but as we yield
   to his temptations, he continually makes nearer approaches to us, and
   gains a greater power over us.

   Thirdly, But for all this the devil can force no man to sin; his
   temptations may move and excite men to sin, but that they are prevalent
   and effectual, proceeds from our own will and consent; it is our own
   lusts closing with his temptations that produce sin. The devil hath
   more or less power over men, according as they give way to him; but
   never so much as to force their wills, and to compel them to consent
   to, and comply with his temptations; the grace of God doth hardly offer
   this violence to men for their good, in order to their salvation; and
   therefore much less will he permit the devil to have this power over
   men to their ruin and destruction. God's commanding us to resist the
   devil supposeth that his temptations are not irresistible.

   Fourthly, From what hath-been said, it appears, that though the devil
   be frequently accessary to the sins of men, yet we ourselves are the
   authors of them; he tempts us many times to sin, but it is we that
   commit it. His temptations may sometimes be so violent as to extenuate
   our fault, but never so forcible as wholly to excuse us; for we are so
   far guilty of sin, as we give our consent to it: and how powerful
   soever the temptation be to any kind of evil, there is always enough of
   our own will in it to render us guilty.

   I am far from thinking that the devil tempts men to all the evil that
   they do. I rather think that the greatest part of the wickedness that
   is committed in the world, springs from the evil motions of men's own
   minds. Men's own lusts are generally to them the worst devil of the
   two, and do more strongly incline them to sin, than any devil without
   them can tempt them to it. It is not to be doubted, that the devil does
   all the mischief he can to the souls of men, so far as God permits him;
   and though the number of evil angels be probably very great, yet it is
   but finite, and every one of them hath a limited power; and though they
   be very active, yet they can be but one where at once; so that his
   malice at the utmost does only all the evil that it can, not all that
   it would; he plies where he has the best custom, where he has the
   fairest opportunity, and the greatest hopes; he leaves men many times
   for a season, as (it is said) he did our Saviour, because he despairs
   of success at that time; and it may be, sometimes when he is gone,
   these persons grow secure, and through their own security and folly,
   fall into those sins which the devil, with all his baits and wiles,
   whilst they were upon their guard, could not tempt them to commit.

   Others, after he has made them pure, and put them into the way of it,
   will go on of themselves, and are as mad of sinning, as forward to
   destroy themselves, as the devil himself could wish; so that he can
   hardly tempt men to any wickedness, which he does not find them
   inclined to of themselves. These he can trust with themselves, and
   leave them to their own inclinations and conduct, finding, by
   experience, that they will do as ill things of their own motion, as if
   Satan stood continually at their right hand to prompt them, and put
   them on, so that he can go into a far country, and employ himself
   elsewhere, and leave them for a long time; being confident, that in his
   absence they will not bury their talent, and hide it in a napkin, but
   will improve it to a great advantage. And I wish that our own age did
   not afford us too many instances of this kind, of such forward and
   expert sinners, as need no tempter either to instruct or excite them to
   that which is evil. Now, in this case, the devil be takes himself to
   other persons, and removes his snares and baits where he thinks there
   is more need and occasion for them.

   So that we may reasonably conclude, that there is a great deal of
   wickedness committed in the world, which the devil hath no immediate
   hand in, though he always rejoiceth in it when it is done; and that
   there is a great deal more reason to attribute all good to the motions
   and operations of the Spirit of God, than to ascribe all sin and
   wickedness in the world to the devil; because the Spirit of God is more
   powerful, and is always every where, and is more intent upon his
   design, and as forward to promote it, as the devil can be to carry on
   his work; nay, I doubt not but he is more active to excite men to good,
   than the devil can be to tempt them to evil. And yet for all this I
   think there is no great reason to doubt, but that good men do many good
   actions of their own inclination, without any special and immediate
   motion from the Spirit of God. They are, indeed, at first regenerate,
   and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, and are continually afterwards under
   the conduct of the same Spirit: but where there is a new nature, it is
   of itself inclinable to that which is good, and will bring forth
   fruits, and do actions answerable. Much less do I think that the devil
   tempts every man to all the evil that he does, or the greatest part.
   When the lusts of men, and the habits of vice are grown strong and
   confirmed, the devil may spare his temptations in a great measure; for
   after bad men are wound to such a pitch of impiety, they will go a
   great while of themselves.

   I have done with the first observation; that as the apostle acquits God
   from having any hand in tempting men to sin, so neither does he ascribe
   the efficacy and prevalency of temptation to the devil. I proceed to
   the

   Second observation, That he ascribes the efficacy and success of
   temptation to the lusts and vicious inclinations of men, which seduce
   them to a consent and compliance with the temptations which are
   afforded to them. "Every man is tempted when he is drawn aside of his
   own lust, and enticed." We have many powerful enemies; but we are much
   more in danger of treachery from within, than of assaults from without.
   All the power of our enemies could not destroy us if we were but true
   to ourselves; so that the apostle had great reason to ascribe the
   efficacy of temptation, to the irregular desires and vicious
   inclinations of men, rather than to those temptations which the
   providence of God permits them to be assaulted with, and consequently
   to lay the blame of men's sins chiefly upon themselves.

   And that chiefly upon these two accounts:

   First, Because the lusts of men are in a great measure voluntary.

   Secondly, God hath put it in our power to resist those temptations, and
   overcome them. Now, so far as the lusts of men are voluntary, it is
   their own fault that they are seduced by them; and if God hath put it
   in our power to resist and overcome temptations, we may blame ourselves
   if we be overcome and foiled by them.

   First, The lusts of men are in a great measure voluntary. By the lusts
   of men, I mean their irregular desires and vicious inclinations. I
   grant that the nature of man is very much corrupted, and degenerated
   from its primitive integrity and perfection: but we who are Christians,
   have received that grace in baptism, whereby our natures are so far
   healed, as, if we be not wanting to ourselves, and do not neglect the
   means which God hath appointed to us, we may mortify our lusts, and
   live a new life: so that if our lusts remain unmortified, we ourselves
   are in fault, much more if they gain new strength, and proceed to
   habits; for this could not be, if we did not, after we come to age, and
   are able to discern between and to choose good and evil, voluntarily
   consent to iniquity, and, by wilful and deliberate practice of known
   sins, improve the evil inclinations of our nature into vicious habits:
   but if, instead of mortifying and subduing the evil propensions of our
   nature (which is no very difficult work to most persons, if they begin
   it betimes), we will cherish and give new life and power to them, we
   forfeit the grace which we received in baptism, and bring ourselves
   again under the power and dominion of sin; and no wonder then if our
   lusts seduce us, and make us ready to comply with the temptations of
   the world and the devil.

   Nay, and after this it is still our own fault if we do not mortify our
   lusts; for if we would hearken to the counsel of God, and obey his
   calls to repentance, and sincerely beg his grace and Holy Spirit to
   this purpose, we might yet recover ourselves, and "by the Spirit
   mortify the deeds of the flesh;" for though we have left God, he hath
   not quite forsaken us, but is ready to afford his grace again to us,
   though we have neglected and abused it, and to give his Holy Spirit to
   those that ask him, though we have forfeited it; so that though our
   lusts spring from something which is natural, yet that they live and
   have dominion over us is voluntary, because we might remedy it if we
   would, and make use of those means which God in the gospel offers to
   us.

   Secondly, God hath put it in our power to resist these temptations, and
   overcome them; so that it is our own fault if we yield to them, and be
   overcome by them.

   It is naturally in our power to resist many sorts of temptations; and
   the grace of God, if we do not neglect it, and be not wanting to
   ourselves, puts it in our power to resist any temptation that may
   happen to us.

   First, It is naturally in our power to resist many sorts of
   temptations. If we do but make use of our natural reason, and those
   considerations which are common and obvious to men, we may easily
   resist the temptations to a great many sins. Some sins are so horrid in
   their nature, that when we have the strongest temptations to them, we
   cannot but have a natural aversion from them; as deliberate murder, the
   danger and guilt whereof are both so great, a make it easy for any
   considerate man to resist the strongest temptation to it, even that of
   revenge. A plain act of injustice, whether by great fraud, or by
   downright oppression, is so base and disgraceful, so odious and
   abhorred by human nature, that it is not difficult to a man that hath
   but a common understanding and common inclination to be honest, to
   overcome the greatest temptation of gain and advantage; nay, he must
   offer considerable violence to his nature and reason, to bring himself
   to it at first. Profaneness and contempt of God and religion is so
   monstrous a fault, and of so dreadful an appearance, that every man
   that will but use his reason can have no temptation to it, either from
   gratifying his humour, or pleasing his company, or shewing his wit,
   that can be of equal force with the arguments which every man's mind
   and conscience is apt to suggest to him against it.

   Nay, there are many sins much inferior to these, the temptations
   whereto may, by the ordinary reasons and considerations of prudence and
   interest, be baffled and put out of countenance. To instance in common
   swearing, to which I think there is no temptation, either from pleasure
   or advantage, but only from fashion and custom. Now this temptation is
   easy to be conquered, by considering that every man that professeth to
   believe the Bible, must acknowledge it to be a sin; and if any man be
   convinced that it is a sin, I dare undertake to convince him that he
   can leave it. He that can choose, at any time, whether he will speak or
   not (which it is certainly in every man's power to do) can choose
   whether he will swear when he speaks. If he says he does it by custom
   and habit, and when he does not think of it; a very little care and
   resolution will, in a short time, cure any man of that custom; so that
   it is naturally in every man's power to break off this sin.

   Secondly, The grace of God puts it into our power, if we do not neglect
   it, and be not wanting" to ourselves, to resist any temptation that may
   happen to us; and what the grace of God puts into our power, is as
   truly in our power as what we can do ourselves. God offers his grace to
   every man under the gospel, for he has promised to "give his Holy
   Spirit to them that ask him;" and it is naturally in every man's power
   to ask it, otherwise the promise signifies nothing; or if no man can
   ask the Spirit of God till he first have it, then to promise it to them
   that ask it is to promise it to them who have it already, and then it
   is needless to ask it. And if God offers his grace to every man, then
   it is every man's fault if he have it not; and every man that hath it
   may, by the ordinary assistance of that grace, resist any ordinary
   temptation. And if, at any time, God suffers good men to be assaulted,
   he hath promised in such cases an extraordinary grace and assistance:
   and that either he will "not suffer us to be tempted above what we are
   able," or that with the temptation he will find a way to escape, that
   we may be able to bear it.

   And thus I have done with the second thing I propounded to speak to
   from these words: That every man is his own greatest tempter. "Every
   man is tempted when he is drawn aside of his own lust, and enticed."
   And now the proper inferences from what I have been all this while
   discoursing to you are these three:--

   First, Not to think to excuse ourselves by laying the blame of our sins
   upon the temptation of the devil. That the devil tempts us is not our
   fault, because we cannot help it; but it is our voluntary compliance
   with his temptations, our consenting to that evil which he solicits us
   to, which maketh us guilty, "Every man is tempted, when he is drawn
   aside of his own lust;" the lusts of our own hearts give the efficacy
   to the temptations of the devil: men many times sin upon the motions
   and suggestions of the devil; but though he be guilty of tempting us,
   we are guilty of consenting to his temptations.

   Many times we are not sure that the devil tempts us to such a sin, but
   we are sure that we commit it, and consequently that we are guilty of
   it. Nay, it is certain if there were no devil many would be wicked,
   and, perhaps, not much less wicked than they are. The lusts and vicious
   inclinations of men would yield to the temptations of the world, though
   there were none to manage them, and to set them on to the greatest
   advantage; so that we cannot excuse our faults upon this account, that
   we are tempted by the devil. If this were a sufficient excuse for us,
   the devil would take no pleasure in tempting us; the whole design of
   his temptation being to make us guilty, and by the guilt of sin to make
   us miserable.

   Secondly, From hence we learn what reason we have to pray to God, that
   he would "not lead us into temptation," i. e. not permit us to fall
   into it; for, in the phrase of Scripture, God is many times said to do
   those things, which his providence permits to be done. The best of us
   have some remainders of lust, some irregular desires and appetites,
   which will be apt to betray us to sin, when powerful temptations are
   presented to us; so that it is a great happiness to the best of men to
   be kept, by the providence of God, out of the way of violent
   temptations; for our own strength to resist them is but small, and we
   are apt to be secure, and to neglect our guard; we are easy to be
   surprised, and in continual danger through our own weakness or
   carelessness. Our greatest security is, if we be sincere, and heartily
   desirous to do well, and firmly resolved against sin, and do depend
   upon God for his grace and assistance, that his providence will not
   suffer us to fall into the hands of dangerous and violent temptations,
   which probably would be too hard for us; he who knows what our strength
   is, "will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able."

   Thirdly, From hence we may learn the best way to disarm temptations,
   and to take away the power of them; and that is, by mortifying our
   lusts, and subduing our vicious inclinations. When this is done (which
   by the grace of God may be done), temptation hath lost its greatest
   advantage upon us. It is the conspiracy of our lusts, with the
   temptations that set upon us, that betrays us into their power. The
   true reason why men fall into sin, is not because they are tempted, but
   because there is something within them which inclines and disposes them
   to comply with the temptation and to yield to it. It is said, when the
   devil came to our Saviour to tempt him, that "he found nothing in him,"
   and therefore his temptations had no force upon him. The more we
   mortify our lusts, the less the devil will find in us, for his
   temptations to work upon. Every spark is dangerous when it falls upon
   combustible matter; but though sparks fly never so thick there is no
   danger, so long as there is nothing about us to catch fire.

   If we will not be drawn aside and enticed to sin, let us mortify our
   lusts; for, so far as we are mortified, we are out of the power of
   temptation.

   Men are apt to complain of temptations, that they are too hard for
   them, and that they are not able to resist them, though they pray to
   God continually for his grace to that purpose. This, indeed, is one
   means very proper and necessary to be used; but this is not all that we
   are to do; we must break off habits of sin, and subdue our lusts, and
   keep under our inclinations, and then we shall find ourselves able to
   resist and encounter temptations with more success. And till we do
   this, in vain do we pray for God's grace, and depend upon him for
   strength to overcome the temptations that do assault us; for God's
   grace was never designed to countenance the sloth and negligence of
   men, but to encourage and second our resolutions and endeavours of well
   doing. If we expect God's grace and assistance upon other terms, we
   tempt God, and provoke him to leave us to the power of temptations, to
   be drawn away and enticed by our own lusts.

SERMON CXVI.

  PROVING JESUS TO BE THE MESSIAS.

   Now, when John had heard in prison the works of Christ, he sent two of
   his disciples, and said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do
   we look for another? Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew
   John again those things which ye do hear and see: the blind receive
   their sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf
   hear; the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached
   unto them: and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in
   me.--Matt. xi. 2-6.

   ABOUT the time of our Saviour's appearing in the world, there was a
   general expectation of a great Prince that should come out of Judea,
   and govern all nations: this the gentiles had from the prophecies of
   the sybils, which speak of a great King that was to appear in the world
   about that time. So Virgil tells us, that the time of Augustus was the
   utmost date of that prophecy:

   Ultima Cumaei venit jam carminis aetas:

   And Suetonius tells us, that "all over the eastern countries there was
   an ancient and constant tradition, that such a Prince should spring out
   of Judea:" and for this reason it is, that our Saviour is called by the
   prophet, "the expectation of the nations."

   But more especially among the Jews, there was, at that time, a more
   lively and particular expectation, grounded upon the predictions of the
   prophets, of a Prince whom they called the Messias, or the anointed;
   and those who were more devout among them, did at that time wait for
   his appearance; as it is said of Simeon, that "he waited for the
   consolation of Israel." Hence it was, that when John the Baptist
   appeared in the quality of an extraordinary prophet, they sent from
   Jerusalem to inquire whether he were the Messias: (John i. 19.) "The
   Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
   And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ."
   The Sanhedrin, to whom it belonged to judge who were the true prophets,
   sent to know whether he was the Messias or not? he would not take this
   honour to himself; but told them, the Messias was just at hand; and the
   next day, when Jesus came to be baptized of him, he bare record, that
   he was the Son of God, and that he saw the Spirit descending and
   abiding upon him.

   So that it is plain that he knew him, and bare witness of him; which
   makes it the more strange, that, here in the text, he should send two
   of his disciples to inquire, whether he were the Messias or not: "Art
   thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" that is, art thou
   the Messias, or not? for so he is called in the ancient prophecies of
   him, o ercho'menos, he that should come. (Gen. xlix. 10.) "The sceptre
   shall not depart from Judah, till Shiloh come."

   For the resolution of this difficulty, it is very probably said by
   interpreters, and I think there is no reason to doubt of it, that John
   the Baptist did not send this message for his own satisfaction, but to
   satisfy his disciples, who were never very willing to acknowledge Jesus
   for the Messias, because they thought he did shadow and cloud their
   master. From whence we may take notice how men's judgments are apt to
   be perverted by faction and interest; and that good men are too prone
   to be swayed thereby; for such we suppose the disciples of John to have
   been: they will not believe their own master, when they apprehend him
   to speak against their interest; for they knew that they must rise and
   fall in their reputation and esteem, as their master did. They believed
   that their master was a prophet, and came from God; yet, for all that,
   they could not digest his testimony of Christ; because that set him
   above their master; which they were sagacious enough to perceive, that
   it tended to the diminution and lessening of themselves. And that this
   was the thing which troubled them, appears plainly from the complaint
   which they make to their master; (John iii. 26.) "The disciples of John
   came to him and said, He that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou
   barest witness, behold the same baptizeth, and all men come to him."
   This troubled them, to see him invade their master's office, and that
   he began to have more followers than John had; he "baptizeth, and all
   men come to him."

   This prejudice John had endeavoured to root out of their minds, by
   telling them, that he had always declared he was not the Messias: (ver.
   28.) "You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ,
   but that I am sent before him." But when he perceived it still to stick
   with them, and that they observed all his actions, and the miracles
   that he wrought, as if they had a mind to pick a quarrel with him (for
   St. Luke, who relates the same story, tells us, that when our Saviour
   had healed the centurion's servant, and raised from the dead the
   widow's son at Naim, the disciples of John shewed him all these
   things); I say, John the Baptist, perceiving that they watched him so
   narrowly, sent two of his disciples to him, that they might receive
   full satisfaction from him.

   And St. Luke tells us, that, upon their coming to him, he wrought many
   of his miracles before them, to convince them that he was the true
   Messias. (Luke vii. 21, 22.) "And in that same hour he cured many of
   their infirmities, and plagues, and of evil spirits; and to many that
   were blind he gave sight;" and then said to the disciples of John, "Go
   your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that
   the blind see, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf
   hear, and the dead are raised, and to the poor the gospel is preached;
   and blessed is he that is not offended in me."

   So that you see that the reason why John the Baptist sent to our
   Saviour to know whether he was the Messias, was not to satisfy himself,
   for he had no doubt of it; but perceiving his disciples to be
   ill-affected towards our Saviour, and hearing them speak with some envy
   of his miracles, he sent them to him, that, by seeing what he did, and
   hearing what account he gave of himself, they might receive full
   satisfaction concerning him.

   I have been the longer in the clearing of this, that men, upon every
   appearance of contradiction in the evangelical history, may not be too
   forward to suspect the truth of it; but may be convinced, that if they
   would but have patience to examine things carefully, they would find
   that the story does sufficiently vindicate itself; and though it be
   penned with great simplicity, yet there is sufficient care taken to
   free it from being guilty of any contradiction to itself.

   The occasion of the words being thus cleared, there are in them these
   two things considerable:

   First, What it was that John the Baptist sent his disciples to be
   satisfied about; and that was, whether he was the Messias or not? "Now,
   when John had heard in prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his
   disciples." The circumstance of his being in prison, seems to be
   mentioned, to intimate to us the reason why he did not come himself
   along with them; he sent two of his disciples to him, who said unto
   him, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" And
   then,

   Secondly, The answer which our Saviour returns to this message: "Jesus
   answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again the things which ye
   do see and hear: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the
   lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up, and the
   poor have the gospel preached unto them: and blessed is he whosoever
   shall not be offended in me."

   So that these words contain, first, the evidence which our Saviour
   gives of his being the true Messias; secondly, an intimation, that,
   notwithstanding all this evidence which he gave of himself, yet many
   would be offended at him, and reject him; "blessed is he whosoever is
   not offended in me."

   First, The evidence which our Saviour gives of his being the true
   Messias; and to prove this, there were but two things necessary:

   1. To shew that he was sent by God, and had a particular commission
   from him.

   2. That he was the very person of whom the prophets foretold that he
   should be the Messias.

   The first of these he proves by the miracles which he wrought; and the
   second by the correspondency of the things he did, with what was
   foretold by the prophets concerning the Messias; the prophecies
   concerning the Messias were accomplished in him.

   First, By the miracles which he wrought; "the blind receive their
   sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear;
   and the dead are raised up." Here is a brief enumeration of miracles
   which our Saviour wrought; and these were a testimony to him that he
   came from God, and was sent and commissioned by him to declare his will
   to the world. So he himself tells us: (John v. 36 .) "I have a greater
   witness than that of John, for the works which the Father hath given me
   to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the
   Father hath sent me." Upon the evidence of these miracles, Nicodemus, a
   ruler among the Jews, was convinced that he was sent by God: (John iii.
   2.) "We know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do
   these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him." Nay, his
   greatest enemies were afraid of his miracles, knowing how proper an
   argument they are to convince men. John xi. 47, when the chief priests
   and pharisees were met together in council against him, they concluded,
   that if he were permitted to go on and work miracles, he would draw all
   men after him: "What do we? (say they) for this man doeth many
   miracles; if we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him." This
   they said upon occasion of the great miracle of raising Lazarus from
   the dead.

   And, in reason, miracles are the highest attestation that can be given
   to the truth and divinity of any doctrine; and supposing a doctrine not
   to be plainly unworthy of God, and contrary to those natural notions
   which men have of God and religion, we can have no greater evidence of
   the truth of it than miracles; they are such an argument as, in its own
   nature, is apt to persuade and induce belief.

   All truths do not need miracles; some are of easy belief, and are so
   clear by their own light, that they need neither miracle nor
   demonstration to prove them. Such are those self-evident principles
   which mankind do generally agree in: others, which are not so evident
   by their own light, we are content to receive upon clear demonstration
   of them, or very probable arguments for them, without a miracle. And
   there are some truths which, however they may be sufficiently obscure
   and uncertain to most men, yet are they so inconsiderable, and of so
   small consequence, as not to deserve the attestation of miracles; so
   that there is no reason to expect that God should interpose by a
   miracle to convince men of them.

     Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus
     Incident.

   But for such truths as are necessary to be known by us, but are not
   sufficiently evident of themselves, nor capable of cogent evidence,
   especially to prejudiced and interested persons, God is pleased, in
   this case, many times to work miracles for our conviction; and they are
   a proper argument to convince us of a thing that is either in itself
   obscure and hard to, be believed, or which we are prejudiced against,
   and hardly brought to believe; for they are an argument a majori ad
   minus; they prove a thing which is obscure and hard to be believed, by
   something that is more incredible, which yet they cannot deny because
   they see it done. Thus our Saviour proves himself to be an
   extraordinary person, by doing such things as never man did; he
   convinceth them, that they ought to believe what he said, because they
   saw him do those things, which were harder to be believed (if one had
   not seen them) than what he said.

   Miracles are, indeed, the greatest external confirmation and evidence
   that can be given to the truth of any doctrine; and where they are
   wrought with all the advantages they are capable of, they are an
   unquestionable demonstration of the truth of it: and such were our
   Saviour's miracles here in the text, to prove that he was the true
   Messias; here are miracles of all kinds; "the blind receive their
   sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear;
   and the dead are raised up." For the nature of them, they are such as
   are most likely to be Divine, and to come from God, for they were
   healing and beneficial to mankind. Our Saviour here instanceth in those
   things which are of greatest benefit and advantage, and which free men
   from the greatest miseries and in conveniences; the restoring of sight
   to the blind, and hearing to the deaf; soundness and health to the lame
   and the leprous; and life to the dead. And then for the number of them,
   they were many; not one instance of a kind, but several of every kind,
   and great multitudes of most of them; and for the manner of their
   operation, they were public, in the sight and view of great multitudes
   of people, to free them from all suspicion of fraud and imposture; they
   were not wrought privately and in corners, and given out and noised
   abroad, but before all the people, so that every one might see them,
   and judge of them; not only among his own disciples and followers, as
   the church of Rome pretends to work theirs, but among his enemies, to
   convince those that did not believe; and this not done once, and in one
   place, but at several times, and in all places where he came, and for a
   long time, for three years and a half; and, after his death, he endowed
   his disciples and followers with the same power, which lasted for some
   ages. And then for the quality of them, they were miracles of the
   greatest magnitude; those of them, which in themselves might have been
   performed by natural means, as healing the lame, and the leprous, and
   the deaf, he did in a miraculous manner, by a word or a touch, yea, and
   many times at a great distance. But others were, not only in the manner
   of their operation, but in the nature of the thing, unquestionably
   miraculous; as, giving of sight to those that had been born blind, and
   raising up the dead to life, as Lazarus, after he had lain in the grave
   four days; and himself afterwards, the third day after he had been
   buried; which, if there ever was or can be any unquestionable miracles
   in the world, ought certainly to be reputed such. So that our blessed
   Saviour had all the attestation that miracles can give, that he came
   from God. And this is the first evidence of his being the Messias.

   The Jews acknowledge that the Messias, when he comes, shall work great
   miracles; their own Talmud confesseth, that Jesus, the son of Joseph
   and Mary, did work great miracles; and the history of the gospel does
   particularly relate more and greater miracles wrought by him, than by
   Moses and all the prophets that had been since the world began; so that
   we may still put the same question to the Jews, which they did in our
   Saviour's time to one another; "When Christ cometh," when the Messias
   whom ye expect comes, "will he do more miracles than these which this
   man hath done?"

   But, secondly, this will yet more clearly appear by the correspondency
   of the things here mentioned, with what was foretold by the prophets
   concerning the Messias.

   Not to mention innumerable circumstances of his birth, and life, and
   death, and resurrection, and ascension into heaven, together with the
   success and prevalency of his doctrine in the world, all which are
   punctually foretold by some or other of the prophets; I shall confine
   myself to the particulars here in the text.

   First, It was foretold of the Messias, that he should work miraculous
   cures. Isa. xxxv. 4-6. speaking of the Messias, "He will come and save
   you; then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the
   deaf shall be unstopped; then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and
   the tongue of the dumb sing;" this you see was fulfilled here in the
   text. It is true, indeed, the text mentions another miracle which is
   not in the prophet, that he raised the dead; but if God did more than
   he promised and foretold, this is no prejudice to the argument, if all
   that he foretold was accomplished in him. Besides, the Jews have a
   proverb, that God is not content to perform barely what he promiseth,
   but he usually doth something over and above his promise. That the
   Messias should heal the blind, and the deaf, and the lame, Isaiah
   prophesied; and God makes good this promise and prediction to the full;
   the Messias did not only do these, but, which is more and greater than
   any of these, he raised the dead to life.

   Secondly, It was likewise foretold of the Messias, that he should
   preach the gospel to the poor: (Isa. lxi. 1.) "The Spirit of the Lord
   God is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto
   the meek;" euangelisasthai ptochois, "to preach the gospel, or good
   tidings to the poor:" so the LXXII. render the words; and they are the
   very words used by our Saviour here in the text. It is true, indeed,
   this was no miracle; but it was the punctual accomplishment of a
   prophecy concerning the Messias, and consequently an evidence that he
   was the Messias. But, besides, it had something in it which was very
   strange to the Jews, and very different from the way of their doctors
   and teachers; for the rabbies among the Jews would scarce instruct any
   but for great reward; they would meddle with none but those that were
   able to requite their pains; the ordinary and poorer sort of people
   they had in great contempt, as appears by that slighting expression of
   them, (John vii. 48, 49.) "Have any of the rulers or of the pharisees
   believed on him? but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed."
   And Grotius upon this text tells us, that the Jewish masters had this
   foolish and insolent proverb among them, that "the Spirit of God doth
   not rest but upon a rich man;" to which this prediction concerning the
   Messias was a direct contradiction: "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon
   me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor." In
   old time, the prophets were especially sent to the kings and princes of
   the people: but this great prophet comes to "preach the gospel to the
   poor." None have so little reason to be proud as the sons of men, but
   never was any so humble as the Son of God; our Saviour's whole life and
   doctrine was a contradiction to the false opinions of the world; they
   thought the rich and great men of the world the only happy persons; but
   he came "to preach glad tidings to the poor," to bring good news to
   them whom the great doctors of the law despised and set at nought; and
   therefore, to confound their pride and folly, and to confute their
   false opinions of things, he begins that excellent sermon of his with
   this saying, "Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of God."

   Thirdly, It was foretold of the Messias, that the world should be
   offended at him: (Isa. viii. 14.) "He shall be for a stone of
   stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel."
   And, (Isa. liii. 1 3.) "Who hath believed our report? and to whom is
   the arm of the Lord revealed? he hath no form nor comeliness, and when
   we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him; he is
   despised and rejected of men, and we hid, as it were, our faces from
   him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not;" and this likewise is
   intimated in the last words of the text, "and blessed is he whosoever
   shall not be offended in me." Intimating, that, notwithstanding the
   great works that he did among them, which testified of him that he came
   from God; notwithstanding the predictions of their prophets concerning
   the Messias were so clearly and punctually accomplished in him; yet,
   notwithstanding all this, they would take offence at him upon one
   account or other, and reject him and his doctrine: but even this, that
   they rejected him, and would not own him for the Messias, was another
   sign or evidence that he was the true Messias foretold by the prophets:
   for, among other things, this was expressly predicted concerning him,
   that he should be despised and rejected of men.

   And thus I have done with the first thing I propounded to speak to;
   namely, the evidence which our Saviour here gives of his being the true
   Messias.

   First, The many and great miracles which he wrought, prove that he came
   from God. And,

   Secondly, The correspondence of the things he did, with what was
   foretold by the prophets concerning the Messias, declare him to be the
   true Messias.

   I now proceed to the next thing I propounded to speak to; namely,

   Secondly, An intimation in the text, that, not withstanding all the
   evidence Christ gave of himself, yet many would be offended at him, and
   reject him, and his doctrine. In speaking to which, it will be very
   proper to consider,

   First, How the poor came to be more disposed to receive the gospel than
   others.

   Secondly, What those prejudices are which the world had against our
   Saviour and his religion at its first appearance, as also those which
   men have at this day against the Christian religion, and to endeavour
   to shew the unreasonableness of them.

   Thirdly, How happy a thing it is to escape and overcome the common
   prejudices which men have against religion.

   First, How the poor came to be more disposed to receive the gospel than
   others: "The poor have the gospel preached unto them." Which does not
   only signify that our Saviour did more especially apply himself to
   them, but likewise that they were in a nearer disposition to receive
   it, and did, of all others, give the most ready entertainment to his
   doctrine: and this our Saviour declares to us in the beginning of his
   sermon upon the Mount, when he pronounceth the poor blessed upon this
   account, because they were nearer to the kingdom of God than others;
   "Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of God." So likewise
   St. James; (chap. ii. 5.) "Hath not God chosen the poor of this world,
   rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promised to them
   that love him?" So that it seems the poor were, upon some account or
   other, in a nearer disposition to receive the gospel, than the great
   and rich men of this world. And of this there are three accounts to be
   given.

   First, The poor had no earthly interest to engage them to reject our
   Saviour and his doctrine. The high-priests, and scribes, and pharisees,
   among the Jews, they had a plain worldly interest which did engage them
   to oppose our Saviour and his doctrine; for if he were received for the
   Messias, and his doctrine embraced, they must of necessity lose their
   sway and authority among the people; and all that which rendered them
   so considerable, their pretended skill in the law, and in the
   traditions and observances of their fathers, together with their
   external shows of piety and devotion, would signify nothing, if our
   Saviour and his doctrine should take place. And there are very few so
   honest and sincere, as to be content, for truth's sake, to part with
   their reputation and authority, and to become less in the esteem of men
   than they were before. Few are so impartial as to quit those things
   which they have once laid great weight upon, and kept a great stir
   about; because this is to acknowledge that they were in an error, and
   mistaken in their zeal, which few have the ingenuity to own, though it
   be never so plain to others; and, therefore, it is no wonder, that our
   Saviour's doctrine met with so much resistance from these, who were so
   much concerned, in point of honour and reputation, to make head against
   it. And this account our Saviour himself gives of their infidelity:
   (John v. 44.) "How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another,
   and seek not the honour which cometh of God only?" and, (chap. xii.
   43.) "For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God."

   And, besides the point of reputation, those that were rich were
   concerned in point of interest to oppose our Saviour and his doctrine;
   because he called upon men to deny themselves, and to part with houses
   and lands, yea, and life itself, for his sake, and for the gospel's,
   which must needs be a very hard and unpleasant doctrine to rich men,
   who had great estates, and had set their hearts upon them. Upon this
   account it is, that our Saviour pronounceth it so hard "for a rich man
   to enter into the kingdom of God;" and compares it with those things
   that are most difficult, and humanly impossible; "I say unto you, it is
   easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich
   man to enter into the kingdom of God."

   But now the poor were free from these encumbrances and temptations;
   they had nothing to lose, and therefore our Saviour's doctrine went
   down more easily with them; because it did not contradict their
   interest, as it did the interest of those who had great estates and
   possessions.

   Secondly, Another reason of this is, that those that are poor, and
   enjoy little of the good things of this life, are willing to entertain
   good news of happiness in another. Those who are in a state of present
   misery and suffering, are glad to hear that it shall be well with them
   hereafter, and are willing to listen to the good news of a future
   happiness; and therefore our Saviour, when he had pronounced the poor
   blessed, (Luke vi. 20.) adds, by way of opposition, (ver. 24.) "But woe
   unto yon that are rich; for ye have received your consolation." They
   Mere in so comfortable a condition at present, that they were not much
   concerned what should become of them hereafter; whereas all the comfort
   that poor men have, is the hopes of a better condition, non si male
   nunc, el olim sic erit, that "if it be bad now, it will not be so
   always;" and therefore, no wonder if the promises and assurance of a
   future happiness be very welcome to them.

   Thirdly, If by the poor we do not only understand those who are in a
   low and mean condition as to the things of this world, but such,
   likewise, as had a temper and disposition of mind suitable to the
   poverty of their outward condition, which our Saviour calls poverty of
   spirit, by which he means meekness and humility; there is no doubt but
   that such a frame and temper of spirit is a great disposition to the
   receiving of truth. And that this is included in the notion of poverty,
   is very plain, both from the words of the prophecy I cited before,
   (Isa. lxi. 1.) "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord
   hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek, and to bind up the
   broken hearted;" and likewise from our Saviour's description of these
   persons, in one of the evangelists; (Matt. v. 3.) "Blessed are the poor
   in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God." So that, by the poor, who
   are so nearly disposed to receive the gospel, our Saviour intended
   those, who, being in a poor and low condition in respect of outward
   things, were likewise meek and humble in their spirits. Now meekness
   and humility are great dispositions to the entertaining of truth. These
   graces and virtues do prepare the minds of men for learning and
   instruction; meekness, and modesty, and humility, are the proper
   dispositions of a scholar. He that hath a mean opinion of himself is
   ready to learn of others; he who is not blinded by pride, or passion,
   is more apt to consider things impartially, and to pass a truer
   judgment upon them, than the proud and the passionate. Passion and
   pride are great obstacles to the receiving of truth, and to our
   improvement in knowledge. Passion does not only darken the minds of
   men, but puts a false bias upon our judgments, which draws them off
   many times from truth, and sways them that way to which our passion in
   clines them. A man of a calm and meek temper stands always indifferent
   for the receiving of truth, and holds the balance of his judgment even;
   but passion sways and inclines it one way, and that commonly against
   truth and reason. So, likewise, pride is a impediment to knowledge, and
   the very worst quality that a learner can have; it obstructs all the
   passages whereby knowledge should enter into us, it makes men refuse
   instruction, out of a conceit they need it not. Many men might have
   known more, had it not been for the vain opinion which they have
   entertained of the sufficiency of their knowledge. This is true in all
   kinds of learning, but more especially as to the knowledge of Divine
   things. For God loves to communicate himself, and bestow his grace and
   wisdom upon meek and humble minds. So the Scripture tells us, (Psal.
   xxv. 9.) "The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he
   teach his ways." And, (1 Pet. v. 5.) "Be clothed with humility: for God
   resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble."

   And thus I have shewn in what respects the poor were more disposed for
   the receiving the gospel than others. I proceed now, to the

   Second thing; namely, What those prejudices and objections are, which
   the world had against our Saviour and his religion at their first
   appearance; as also to inquire into those which men have at this day
   against the Christian religion, and to shew the weakness and
   unreasonableness of them. I begin,

   First, With those prejudices which the world had against our Saviour
   and his religion, at their first appearance.

   Both Jews and gentiles were offended at him and his doctrine; but not
   both upon the same account. They both took exceptions at him,
   especially at his low and suffering condition; but not both upon the
   same reason. I shall begin with the exceptions which the Jews took
   against our blessed Saviour and his religion; and I shall reduce them
   all, or at least the most considerable of them (as I find them
   dispersed in the history of the gospel, and in the Acts of the
   Apostles) to these six heads:

   First, The exceptions which they took against him upon account of his
   extraction and original.

   Secondly, At the meanness of his condition, contrary to their universal
   expectation.

   Thirdly, As to his miracles.

   Fourthly, His conversation.

   Fifthly, The prejudice that lay against him from the opposition that
   was made by persons of greatest knowledge and authority among them.
   And,

   Lastly, That the religion which he endeavoured to introduce, did
   abolish and supersede their ancient religion, as of no longer use and
   continuance, though it was plain it was at first instituted by God.

   First, The exceptions which they took at his extraction and original.
   In relation to this they were offended at three things.

   1. That his original was known among them. This you find urged against
   him, John vii. 27, "We know this man whence he is; but when the Messias
   comes, no man knows whence he is."

   This, to be sure, was no just exception in reason against him. For what
   if his extraction were known, might he not be from God for all that?
   They owned Moses for the greatest prophet that ever was, and yet it was
   very well known from whence he was.

   But they seem to refer to some prophecy of the Old Testament, which did
   seem to assert so much. If they meant that his extraction should be
   altogether unknown, they knew very well, and believed the contrary,
   that he was to be of the line of David, and to come out of Bethlehem.
   If they referred to that prophecy, that "a virgin should conceive and
   bear a son," and so understood that he should be without father, this
   was really true, though they thought that he was the son of Joseph. And
   if he affirmed that he had no father, he did sufficiently justify it by
   his miracles; that being as easy to be believed possible by a Divine
   power, as the miracles which he wrought; which yet they could not deny,
   because they saw them.

   2. Another prejudice against his extraction, was the meanness of his
   parents and breeding. This you find mentioned, Matt. xiii. 54, 55.
   "Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? is not this
   the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren
   James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? and his sisters, are they not
   all with us? whence then hath this man these things? And they were
   offended in him." And so, likewise, John vii. 15. "How knoweth this man
   letters, having never learned?"

   A strange prejudice, and most unreasonable. They could not believe him
   to be an extraordinary person, because his parents and relations, his
   birth and breeding, were so mean. He had been brought up to a trade,
   and not brought up to learning: whereas, in reason, this ought to have
   been an argument just the other way; that he was an extraordinary
   person, and divinely assisted, who all on the sudden, without the help
   and assistance of education, gave such evidence of his great wisdom and
   knowledge, and did such mighty works. This could not be imputed to his
   breeding, for that was mean; therefore, there must be something
   extraordinary and Divine in it. Thus another man, who had been free
   from prejudice, would have reasoned.

   3. The most unreasonable prejudice of all, in respect of his
   extraction, was grounded upon a spiteful and malicious proverb,
   concerning the country where our Saviour was brought up, and they
   supposed him to be born; and that was Galilee: (John i. 46.) "Can any
   good thing come out of Nazareth?" and, (John vii. 41.) "Shall the
   Messias come out of Galilee?" and, (ver. 52.) "Search and look, for out
   of Galilee ariseth no prophet."

   But it seems Nathanael, who was a good man, was easily taken off from
   this common prejudice, when Philip said to him, "Come and see." He bids
   him come and see the works he did, and then refers it to him, whether
   he would believe his own eyes, or an old proverb: however, it seems the
   Jews laid great weight upon it, as if this alone were enough to confute
   all his miracles; and, after they had shot this bolt at him, the
   business was concluded clearly against him. But prudent and considerate
   men do not use to give much credit to ill-natured proverbs; the good or
   bad characters which are given of countries are not understood to be
   universally true, and without exception. There is no place but hath
   brought forth some brave spirits and excellent persons, whatever the
   general temper and disposition of the inhabitants may be. Among the
   Grecians, the Boeotians were esteemed a dull people, even to a proverb;
   and yet Pindar, one of their chief poets, was one of them. The
   Scythians were a barbarous nation, and one would have thought no good
   could have come from thence; and yet that country yielded Anacharsis,
   an eminent philosopher. The Idumeans were aliens and strangers to -the
   covenant; and yet Job, one of the best men that ever was, came from
   thence. God can raise up eminent persons from any place; Abraham from
   Ur of the Chaldees, and an idolatrous people. Nay, as our Saviour tells
   us, "he can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham." The wise
   God, in the government of the world, does not tie himself to our
   foolish proverbs. It is not necessary, to make a man a prophet, that he
   should be bred in a good air. If God sends a man, it matters not from
   what place he comes.

   Secondly, Another head of exception against our Saviour, was the
   meanness of his outward condition, so contrary to the universal
   expectation of the Jews. The Jews, from the tradition of their fathers,
   to which they (as the church of Rome does at this day) paid a greater
   reverence than to the written word of God, were possessed with a strong
   persuasion, that the Messias whom they expected w as to be a great
   prince and conqueror, and to subdue all nations to them; so that
   nothing could be a greater defeat to their expectations, than the mean
   and low condition in which our Saviour appeared; so that, upon this
   account, they were almost universally offended at him.

   But this prejudice was very unreasonable. For neither did their
   prophets foretel any such thing as the temporal greatness of the
   Messias: but, on the contrary, most expressly, that "he should be
   despised and rejected of men," that he should be "a man of sorrows" and
   sufferings, and at last be put to death; which was directly contrary to
   what they expected from their ill-grounded tradition.

   Thirdly, Against his miracles they made these two exceptions:

   1. That he wrought them by magical skill, and by the power of the
   devil.

   Which was so exorbitantly unreasonable and malicious, that our Saviour
   pronounceth it to be an unpardonable sin; and, for answer to it,
   appeals to every man's reason, whether it was likely that the devil
   should conspire against himself, and assist any man to overthrow his
   own kingdom? For it was as plain our Saviour's doctrine was directly
   contrary to the devil's design; and, therefore, to assist him to work
   miracles for the confirmation of it, must have been apparently against
   his own interest, and to the ruin of his own kingdom.

   2. They pretended, that though he did many great works, yet he gave
   them no sign from heaven. Matt. xvi. 1, it is said, "They desired him
   to shew them a sign from heaven." It seems they expected that God
   should give some immediate testimony to him from heaven; as he did to
   Elias, when fire came down from heaven, and consumed his enemies; and
   particularly they expected, that, when he was upon the cross, if he
   were the true Messias, he should have come down and saved himself. And
   because he did not answer their expectation in this, they concluded him
   an impostor.

   Now what could be more unreasonable, when he had wrought so many other
   and great miracles, perversely to insist upon some particular kind of
   miracle which they fancied? as if God were bound to gratify the
   curiosity of men; and as if our Saviour were not as much declared to be
   the Son of God, by rising again from the dead, as if he had come down
   from the cross.

   Fourthly, As to his conversation, they had these three exceptions:

   1. That he used no severity in his habit or diet; took too much
   freedom, as they thought; came eating and drinking; that is, he freely
   used the creatures of God for the end for which they were given, with
   temperance and thanksgiving; and did not lay those rigorous restraints
   upon himself in these matters, which many that were esteemed the most
   religious among them used to do.

   But he plainly shews them that this exception was merely out of their
   prejudice against him. For if he had come in the way of austerity, they
   would have objected to him as well. They were resolved to find fault
   with him, whatever he did. (Matt. xi. 16.) "Whereunto shall I liken
   this generation? John the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking, and
   they say he hath a devil." He lived in a more austere and melancholy
   way, "he came in the way of righteousness," used great strictness and
   severity in his habit and diet, and this they took exception at. Our
   Saviour was of a quite contrary temper, and that did not please them
   neither. "The Son of man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold
   a wine-bibber and a glutton." So that let our Saviour have done what he
   would, he could not have earned himself so as to have escaped the
   censures of men so peevishly and perversely disposed.

   2. That he kept company with publicans and sinners.

   To which exception nothing can be more reason able than our Saviour's
   own answer; that he was sent to be a physician to the world, "to call
   sinners to repentance;" and therefore, they had no reason to be angry,
   or think it strange, if he conversed with his patients, among whom his
   proper employment lay.

   3. They objected to him profaneness in breaking the sabbath; and that
   surely was plain, that he could not be of God, if he kept not the
   sabbath-day. The truth was, he had healed one on the sabbath-day.

   To this our Saviour gives a most reasonable and satisfactory answer,
   that surely "it was lawful to do good on the sabbath-day;" that that
   was but a positive institution, but works of mercy are natural and
   moral duties; and God himself had declared, that he would have even his
   own institutions to give way to those greater duties, that are of
   natural and eternal obligation. "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice."
   And then from the end of the sabbath; the sabbath was made for the rest
   and refreshment of man; and therefore could not be presumed to be in
   tended to his prejudice. "The sabbath was made for man: and not man for
   the sabbath."

   Fifthly, Another great prejudice against him, was, that persons of the
   greatest knowledge and authority among them did not embrace his
   doctrine. (John vii. 48.) "Have any of the rulers or pharisees believed
   on him?" So that here was the infallible rule and authority of their
   church against him.

   There is no doubt but the example and authority of our guides ought to
   sway very much with us, and overrule us in doubtful cases, but not
   against plain and convincing evidence; there we ought to follow "and
   obey God rather than men." There is some times a visible and palpable
   corruption in those who are to lead us; they may have an interest to
   oppose the truth: and thus it was with the pharisees and rulers at that
   time; and so it hath been among Christians in the great degeneracy of
   the Roman church. The Christian religion was never more endangered, nor
   ever more corrupted, than by those who have been in greatest authority
   in that church; who ought to have understood religion best, and have
   been the principal support of it. Men may err, but God cannot: so that
   when God sends a prophet, or by his word does plainly declare his will
   to us, human example and authority ceaseth, and is of no force.

   The last prejudice I shall mention, which the Jews had against our
   Saviour and his doctrine, was, that it did abolish and supersede their
   religion, as of no longer use and continuance, though it was plain it
   was instituted by God.

   This had been a very specious pretence, indeed, had not this been part
   of their religion, and had not their own prophets foretold that the
   Messias should come, and perfect what was wanting and defective in
   their institution. It is expressly said in their law, that "God would
   raise unto them another prophet, like to Moses, and that they should
   hear him," when he came. So that, in truth, it was the accomplishment
   of all those revelations which were made to the Jews, and did not
   reprove the Jewish religion as false, but as imperfect; and did not
   contradict and overthrow, but perfect and fulfil the law and the
   prophets.

   And thus I have gone over the chief exceptions and offences which the
   Jews took at our Saviour and his doctrine; and I hope sufficiently
   shewn the unreasonableness of them. I have not now time to proceed to
   what remains: but by what hath been said, you may easily see, upon what
   slight and unreasonable grounds men may be prejudiced against the best
   person and things, and yet be very confident all the while that they
   are in the right. For so, no doubt, many of the Jews, who opposed our
   Saviour and his doctrine, thought themselves to be. Therefore it
   concerns us to put on meekness, and humility, and modesty, that we may
   be able to judge impartially of things, and our minds may be preserved
   free and indifferent to receive the truths of God, when they are
   offered to us: otherwise, self-conceit and passion will so blind our
   minds, and bias our judgments, that we shall be unable to discern, and
   unwilling to entertain, the plainest and most evident truths. We see
   here, by the sad example of the Jews, that by giving way to passion,
   and cherishing pride and self-conceit, men may he so deeply prejudiced
   against the truth, as to resist the clearest light, and reject even
   salvation itself, when it is offered to them. So that is not in vain,
   that the Scripture saith, "Let every man be swift to hear, and slow to
   wrath; for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God:" and
   exhorts us so earnestly, to "receive with meekness the word of God,
   which is able to save our souls."
