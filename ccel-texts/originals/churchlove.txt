Prefatory note.

   In 1672, the year in which this "Discourse concerning Evangelical Love,
   Church-Peace, and Unity" was published, an indulgence had been extended
   to Dissenters; and, encouraged by this capricious gleam of better
   feeling on the part of the Government, Dr Owen endeavours in the
   following discourse to exhibit the religious principles of his
   denomination, under a light fitted to disarm hostility and allay the
   rancour with which they had been long regarded.

   He shows, Chap. i., that it was not from want of Christian love they
   continued in a state of separation from the Church of England. After
   illustrating the obligation of Christian love to all mankind in
   general, ii., he proceeds to establish the claims of the Church of
   Christ on our affections, considering it first as the spiritual body of
   Christ, secondly, in regard to its outward profession, and, thirdly, as
   consisting of professors of the gospel ranged under particular
   churches. In a position of dissent from the Church of England, there is
   no repudiation of it as a true church of Christ, and no sin of schism
   from the church, viewed as catholic and invisible, or as visibly
   professing the fundamental truths of the gospel, iii. The causes of
   schisms and divisions are specified, such as erroneous views of
   evangelical unity, and the neglect of various duties incumbent upon the
   churches for the preservation of order and purity, iv. In the last
   chapter the grounds and reasons of nonconformity are stated. He first
   proves that the imposition of terms of communion not required by divine
   law is inconsistent with the rule of communion established by Christ
   himself; secondly, with the practice of the apostles; thirdly, with the
   doctrine of Scripture on the duty of churches and the liberty of
   Christians in these matters; fourthly, with certain special facts in
   the history of the primitive churches; and, fifthly, he argues that if
   unscriptural terms of communion are allowed, it would follow that no
   rule of communion had been fixed by Christ himself, -- an inference
   which would set aside the authority of Christ over the church. He next
   illustrates in what respects the terms of communion in the Church of
   England are unscriptural; -- in the subscription to the liturgy which
   is exacted; in the canonical submission required to the polity of the
   church; in the observance of unscriptural ceremonies; and in the oath
   of canonical obedience, which must be taken by its ministers. He shows
   farther, that in conforming to the usages and polity of the Established
   Church, consent would be given, to the omission of sundry duties which
   Christ expressly enjoins, -- such as the obligation of every minister
   of the gospel to take the immediate care of the flock whereof he is the
   overseer, and the responsibility under which he lies to admit to
   sacramental privileges those only who make "a credible profession of
   repentance, faith, and obedience." The scope of the argument is to
   produce the conviction that the guilt of schism rests not with those
   who refuse, but with those who exact compliance with unscriptural terms
   of communion.

   Mr Orme states that this work of Owen, though very excellent, has not
   attained the celebrity and circulation of his other writings, "perhaps
   in consequence of its being without his name." He does not seem to have
   been aware that though the work on its first issue was anonymous,
   within a twelvemonth after its publication it was issued anew with the
   name of the author on the title-page. The value of this discourse would
   be less appreciated when the controversy between the Established Church
   and Dissenters assumed another phase. The charge of schism, with the
   refutation of which it is occupied, soon lost all power, when, in the
   course of discussion, it came to be felt that this question depended
   entirely on the validity of the grounds on which secession from any
   church took place. And to this change in the nature of the discussion,
   more than to the circumstance that the work was at first published
   anonymously, may be attributed the comparative neglect into which, in
   later times, the treatise had fallen. It contains, nevertheless, much
   important matter, and the spirit which it breathes throughout is
   admirable. -- Ed.

   A Discourse

   concerning

   Christian Love and Peace
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter I.

   Complaints of want of love and unity among Christians, how to be
   managed, and whence fruitless -- Charge of guilt on some, why now
   removed, and for whose sakes -- Personal miscarriages of any not
   excused -- Those who manage the charge mentioned not agreed.

   The great differences that are in the world amongst professors of the
   gospel, about things relating to the worship of God, do exercise more
   or less the minds of the generality of men of all sorts; for, either in
   themselves or their consequences, they are looked on to be of great
   importance. Some herein regard principally that disadvantageous
   influence which they are supposed to have into men's spiritual and
   eternal concernments; others, that aspect which they fancy them to have
   upon the public peace and tranquility of this world. Hence, in all
   ages, such divisions have caused "great thoughts of heart," Judges v.
   15, especially because it is very difficult to make a right judgment
   either of their nature or their tendency. But generally by all they are
   looked on as evil; -- by some, for what they are in themselves; by
   others, from the disadvantage which they bring (as they suppose) unto
   their secular interests. Hence there are amongst many great complaints
   of them, and of that want of love which is looked on as their cause.
   And, indeed, it seems not only to be in the liberty, but to be the duty
   of every man soberly to complain of the evils which he would but cannot
   remedy; for such complaints, testifying a sense of their evil and a
   desire of their cure, can be no more than what love unto the public
   good requireth of us. And if in any case this may be allowed, it must
   be so in that of divisions about sacred things or the worship of God,
   with their causes and manner of management amongst men: for it will be
   granted that the glory of God, the honour of Christ, the progress of
   the gospel, with the edification and peace of the church, are deeply
   concerned in them, and highly prejudiced by them; and in these things
   all men have, if not an equal, yet such a special interest as none can
   forbid them the due consideration of. No man, therefore, ought to be
   judged as though he did transgress his rule, or go beyond his line, who
   soberly expresseth his sense of their evil and of the calamities
   wherewith they are attended. Yet must it not be denied but that much
   prudence and moderation are required unto the due management of such
   complaints; for those which either consist in, or are accompanied with,
   invectives against the persons or ways of others, instead of a rational
   discourse of the causes of such divisions and their remedies, do not
   only open, inflame, and irritate former wounds, but prove matters of
   new contention and strife, to their great increase. Besides, in the
   manifold divisions and differences of this nature amongst us, all men
   are supposed to be under an adherence unto some one party or other.
   Herein every man stands at the same distance from others as they do
   from him. Now, all complaints of this kind carry along with them a
   tacit justification of those by whom they are made; for no man can be
   so profligate as to judge himself, and the way of religious worship
   wherein he is engaged, to be the cause of blamable divisions amongst
   Christians, and yet continue therein: reflections, therefore, of guilt
   upon others they are usually replenished withal. But if those are not
   attended with evident light and unavoidable conviction, because they
   proceed from persons supposed not indifferent, yea, culpable in this
   very matter more or less themselves, by them whom they reflect upon,
   they are generally turned into occasions of new exasperations and
   contests. And hence it is come to pass, that although all good men do
   on all occasions bewail the want of love, forbearance, and
   condescension that is found among professors of the gospel, and the
   divisions which follow thereon, yet no comfortable nor advantageous
   effects do thence ensue. Yea, not only is all expectation of that
   blessed fruit, which a general serious consent unto such complaints
   might produce, as yet utterly frustrated, but the small remainders of
   love and peace amongst us are hazarded and impaired, by mutual charges
   of the want and loss of them on the principles and practices of each
   other. We have, therefore, need of no small watchfulness and care, lest
   in this matter it fall out with us as it did with the Israelites of old
   on another occasion, 2 Sam. xix. 41-43. For when they had, by a sinful
   sedition, cast out David from amongst them, and from reigning over
   them, after a little while, seeing their folly and iniquity, they
   assembled together with one consent to bring him home again; but in the
   very beginning of their endeavours to this purpose, falling into a
   dispute about which of the tribes had the greatest interest in him,
   they not only desisted from their first design, but fell into another
   distemper of no less dangerous importance than what they were newly
   delivered from. It must be acknowledged that there hath been a sinful
   decay of love among professors of the gospel in this nation, if not a
   violent casting of it out, by such prejudices and corrupt affections as
   wherewith it is wholly inconsistent. And it would be a matter of no
   small lamentation if, upon the blooming of a design for its recovery
   and reduction, with all its train of forbearance, condescension,
   gentleness, and peace, if any such design there be, by contests about
   the occasions and causes of its absence, with too much fierceness in
   our own vindication, and pleas of a special interest in it above
   others, new distempers should be raised, hazarding its everlasting
   exclusion.

   In this state of things we have hitherto contented ourselves with the
   testimony of our own hearts unto the sincerity of our desires, as to
   walk in love and peace with all men, so to exercise the fruits of them
   on all occasions administered unto us. And as this alone we have thus
   far opposed unto all those censures and reproaches which we have
   undergone to the contrary, so therewithal have we supported ourselves
   under other things which we have also suffered. Farther to declare our
   thoughts and principles, in and about the worship of God, than they are
   evidenced and testified unto by our practice, we have hitherto
   forborne, lest the most moderate claims of an especial interest in the
   common faith and love of Christians should occasion new contests and
   troubles unto ourselves and others. And we have observed, that
   sometimes an over-hasty endeavour to extinguish flames of this nature
   hath but increased and diffused them, when, perhaps, if left alone,
   their fuel would have failed, and themselves expired. Besides, a
   peaceable practice, especially if accompanied with a quiet bearing of
   injuries, gives a greater conviction to unprejudiced minds of peaceable
   principles and inclinations than any verbal declaration, whose
   sincerity is continually obnoxious to the blast of evil surmises. In a
   resolution, therefore, to the same purpose we had still continued, had
   we not so openly and frequently been called on either to vindicate our
   innocency or to confess and acknowledge our evil. One of these, we
   hope, is the aim and tendency of all those charges or accusations, for
   want of love, peaceableness, and due compliance with others, of being
   the authors and fomenters of schisms and divisions, that have been
   published against us, on the account of our dissent from some
   constitutions of the church of England: for we do not think that any
   good men can please themselves in merely accusing their brethren,
   whereby they add to the weight of their present troubles, and evidently
   expose them unto more; for every charge of guilt on those who are
   already under sufferings gives new encouragement and fierceness to the
   minds of them from whom they suffer. And as no greater encouragement
   can be given unto men to proceed in any way wherein they are engaged
   than by their justification in what they have already done; so the only
   justification of those who have stirred up persecution against others
   consists in charging guilt on them that are persecuted. As, therefore,
   we shall readily acknowledge any evil in our persons, principles, or
   ways, which we are or may be convinced of; so the sober vindication of
   truth and innocency, that none of the ways of God be evil spoken of by
   reason of us, is a duty in the care whereof we are no less concerned.
   Yea, did we design and directly endeavour our own justification, we
   should do no more than the prime dictates of the law of nature, and the
   example of some of the best of men, will give us a sufficient warrant
   for. Besides, the clearing of private persons, especially if they are
   many, from undue charges and false accusations, belongs unto public
   good, that those who have the administration of it committed unto them
   may not be misled to make a wrong judgment concerning what they have to
   do, as David was in the case of Mephibosheth, upon the false
   suggestions of Ziba, 2 Sam. xvi. 4. Neither could we be justly blamed
   should we be more than ordinarily urgent herein, considering how prone
   the ears of men are to receive calumnious accusations concerning such
   as from whom they expect neither profit nor advantage, and how slow in
   giving admittance to an address of the most modest defensative. But
   this is the least part of our present design. Our only aim is, to
   declare those principles concerning mutual love and unity among
   Christians, and practices in the worship of God, wherein our own
   consciences do find rest and peace, and others have so much misjudged
   us about. This, therefore, we shall briefly do, and that without such
   reflections or recriminations as may any way exasperate the spirits of
   others, or in the least impede that re-introduction of love and concord
   which it is the duty of us all to labour in. Wherefore we shall herein
   have no regard unto the revilings, reproaches, and threatenings of them
   who seem to have had no regard to truth, or modesty, or sobriety,
   indeed to God or man, in the management of them. With such it is our
   duty not to strive, but to commit our cause to Him that judgeth
   righteously, especially with respect unto those impure outrages which
   go before unto judgment. Furious persons, animated by their secular
   interests or desire of revenge, unacquainted with the spirit of the
   gospel and the true nature of the religion revealed by Jesus Christ,
   incompassionate towards the infirmities of the minds of men, whereof
   yet none in the world give greater instances than themselves, who have
   no thoughts but to trample under foot and destroy all that differ from
   them, we shall rather pity and pray for, than either contend withal or
   hope to convince. Such they are, as, if outward prevalency were added
   to their principles and desires, they would render all Christians like
   the Moabites, Ammonites, and Edomites, who came out to fight against
   Judah, 2 Chron. xx. 23. The two greater parties, upon some difference
   or distaste, conspire at first to destroy the inhabitants of Seir, not
   doubting but that, when they had despatched them out of the way, they
   should accord well enough among themselves; but the event deceived
   their expectation, -- their rage ceased not until issued in the mutual
   destruction of them all. No otherwise would it be with those who want
   nothing but force or opportunity to exterminate their next dissenters
   in matters of religion; for when they had accomplished that design, the
   same principle and rage would arm them to the wasting of the residue of
   Christians, or their own, for a conceit of the lawfulness hereof is
   raised from a desire of enlarging power and dominion, which is
   boundless. Especially is it so where an empire over the reason, faith,
   and consciences of men is affected; which first produced the fatal
   engine of papal infallibility, that nothing else could have strained
   the wit of men to invent, and nothing less can support. Unto such as
   these we shall not so much as tender satisfaction, until they are
   capable of receiving the advice of the apostle, Eph. iv. 31, "Let all
   bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be
   put away from you, with all malice;" for until this be done, men are to
   be esteemed but as "raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own
   shame," whom it is to no purpose to seek to pacify, much less to
   contend withal.

   It is for the sake of them alone who really value and esteem love,
   peace, and unity among Christians for themselves, that we here tender
   an account of our thoughts and principles concerning them; for even of
   them there are some who unduly charge us with owning of principles
   destructive unto Christian love and condescension, and suited to
   perpetuate the schisms and divisions that are amongst us. Whether this
   hath been occasioned by an over-valuation of their own apprehensions,
   conceiting that their judgments ought to give rule and measure to other
   men's; or whether they have been, it may be insensibly unto themselves,
   biased by provocations, as they suppose, unjustly given them; we are
   not out of hopes but that they may be convinced of their mistakes. Upon
   their indications we have searched our consciences, principles, and
   practices, to find whether there be any such way of perverseness in
   them as we are charged withal; and may with confidence say that we have
   a discharge from thence, where we are principally concerned. Having,
   therefore, satisfied that duty which on this occasion was in the first
   place incumbent on us, we shall now, for their satisfaction and our own
   vindication with all impartial men, declare what are our thoughts and
   judgments, what are our principles, ways, and practices, in and about
   the great concerns of Christian love, unity, and peace, referring the
   final decision of all differences unto Him who "hath appointed a day,
   wherein he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he
   hath ordained."

   This being our present design, none may expect that we should attempt
   to justify or excuse any of those miscarriages or failings that are
   charged on some or all of those professors of the gospel who at this
   day come not up unto full communion with the church of England; for we
   know that "no man liveth and sinneth not," yea, that "in many things we
   all offend." We all know but in part, and are liable to manifold
   temptations, even all such as are common unto men. Those only we have
   no esteem of who through the fever of pride have lost the understanding
   of their own weak, frail, and sinful condition. And we do acknowledge
   that there are amongst us "sins against the Lord our God," for which he
   might not only give us up unto the reproaches and wrath of men in this
   world, but himself also cast us off utterly and forever. We shall not,
   therefore, in the least complain of those who have most industriously
   represented unto the public view of the world the weakness and
   miscarriages that have fallen out amongst some or more of them whose
   cause we plead, and discovered those corrupt affections from whence,
   helped on with variety of temptations, they might probably proceed; nor
   shall we use any reflections on them who have severely, and we fear
   maliciously, laid to their charge things which they knew not; as hoping
   that by the former the guilty may learn what to amend, now they are
   taught with such thorns and briers as are the scorns and reproaches of
   the world, and by the latter the innocent may know what to avoid. Such
   charges and accusations, therefore, we shall wholly pass over, with our
   hearty prayers that the same or worse evils may never be found amongst
   them by whom they are accused. Much less shall we concern ourselves in
   those reflections on them which are raised from the words, expressions,
   or actions of particular persons, as they have been reported and tossed
   up and down in the lips of talkers. The debate of such things tends
   only to mutual exasperations and endless strife. It may be, also, that
   for the most part they are false, or misreported invidiously, or
   misapplied; and, true or false, have been sufficiently avenged by
   severe retortions. And in such altercations few men understand the
   sharpness of their own words. Their edge is towards them whom they
   oppose; but when a return of the like expressions is made unto
   themselves, they are sensible how they pierce. So are provocations
   heightened, and the first intendment of reducing love ends in mutual
   defamatory contentions. All things, therefore, of this nature we shall
   pass over, and help to bury by our silence.

   The principal charge against us, and that whereinto all others are
   resolved, is our nonconformity unto the present constitutions of the
   church of England; for hence we are accused to be guilty of the want of
   Christian love and peaceableness, of schism, and an inclination to all
   sorts of divisions, contrary to the rules and precepts of the gospel.
   Now, we think it not unreasonable to desire that those who pass such
   censures on us would attend unto the common known rule, whereby alone a
   right judgment in these cases may be made; for it is not equal that we
   should be concluded by other men's particular measures, as though by
   them we were to be regulated in the exercise of love and observance of
   peace. And as we doubt not but that they fix those measures unto
   themselves in sincerity, according unto their own light and
   apprehension of things, so we are sure it will be no impeachment of
   their wisdom or holiness to judge that others who differ from them do
   with an equal integrity endeavour the direction and determination of
   their consciences in what they believe and practice; yea, if they have
   not pregnant evidence to the contrary, it is their duty so to judge. A
   defect hereof is the spring of all that want of love whereof so great a
   complaint is made. And rationally they are to be thought most sincere
   and scrupulous herein who take up with determinations that are greatly
   to their outward disadvantage; for unless it be from a conviction of
   present duty with respect unto God and their own eternal good, men are
   not easily induced to close with a judgment about sacred things and
   religious worship, which will not only certainly prejudice them, but
   endanger their ruin in things temporal. It is ordinarily outward
   secular advantages, wherewith the minds of men are generally too much
   affected, that give an easy admission unto persuasions and practices in
   religion. By these are men turned and changed every day from what
   before they professed, when we hear of no turnings unto a suffering
   profession but what arise from strong and unavoidable convictions.
   Moreover, should we endeavour to accommodate ourselves to the lines of
   other men, it may make some change of the persons with whom we have to
   do, but would not in the least relieve us against the charges of guilt,
   of schism, and want of love, which we suffer under. Some would
   prescribe this measure unto us: That we should occasionally join with
   parish assemblies, as now stated, in all their worship and sacred
   administrations, but will not require of us that we should absolutely
   forbear all other ways and means of our own edification. Will this
   measure satisfy all amongst us? will it free us from the imputation we
   suffer under? shall we not be said any more to want Christian love, to
   be factious or guilty of schism? It is known unto all how little it
   will conduce unto these ends, and how little the most will grant that
   church peace is preserved thereby. Yea, the difficulty will be
   increased upon us beyond what an ordinary ability can solve, though we
   doubt not but that it may be done, for if we can do so much, we may
   expect justly to be pressed severely to answer why we do no more; for
   others say immediately that our attendance on the public worship must
   be constant, with a forbearance of all other ways of religious worship
   beyond that of a family: yet this they would have us so to do, as in
   the meantime studiously to endeavour the reformation of what is judged
   amiss in the doctrine, discipline, and worship of the church. This is
   the measure which is prescribed unto us by some, and we know not how
   many censures are passed upon us for a nonconformity thereunto. Will,
   therefore, a compliance unto this length better our condition? will it
   deliver us from the severest reflections of being persons unpeaceable
   and intolerable? Shall we live in a perpetual dissimulation of our
   judgments as to what needeth reformation? will that answer our duty, or
   give us peace in our latter end? Shall we profess the persuasions of
   our minds in these things, and endeavour by all lawful means to
   accomplish what we desire? shall we then escape the severest censures,
   as of persons inclined to schisms and divisions? Yea, many great and
   wise men of the church of England do look on this as the most
   pernicious principle and practice that any can betake themselves unto;
   and in reporting the memorials of former times, [1] some of them have
   charged all the calamities and miseries that have befallen their church
   to have proceeded from men of this principle endeavouring reformation
   according unto models of their own without separation. And could we
   conscientiously betake ourselves to the pursuit of the same design, we
   should not, especially under present jealousies and exasperations,
   escape the same condemnation that others before us have undergone. And
   so it is fallen out with some; which might teach them that their
   measures are not authentic; and they might learn moderation towards
   them who cannot come up unto them, by the severity they meet withal
   from those that do outgo them. Shall we, therefore, -- which alone
   seems to remain, -- proceed yet farther, and, making a renunciation of
   all those principles conceiving the constitution, rule, and discipline
   of the church, with the ways and manner of the worship of God to be
   observed in the assemblies of it, which we have hitherto professed,
   come over unto a full conformity unto the present constitution of the
   church of England, and all the proceedings of its rulers thereon? "Yea,
   this is that," say some, "which is required of you, and that which
   would put an end unto all our differences and divisions." We know,
   indeed, that an agreement in any thing or way, right or wrong, true or
   false, will promise so to do, and appear so to do for a season; but it
   is truth alone that will make such agreements durable or useful. And we
   are not engaged in an inquiry merely after peace, but after peace with
   truth. Yea, to lay aside the consideration of truth, in a disquisition
   after peace and agreement in and about spiritual things, is to exclude
   a regard unto God and his authority, and to provide only for ourselves.
   And what it is which at present lays a prohibition on our consciences
   against the compliance proposed shall be afterward declared. Neither
   will we here insist upon the discouragements that are given us from the
   present state of the church itself; which yet are not a few. Only, we
   must say, that there doth not appear unto us in many that steadiness in
   the profession of the truth owned amongst us upon and since the
   Reformation, nor that consent upon the grounds and reasons of the
   government and discipline in it that we are required to submit unto,
   which were necessary to invite any dissenters to a thorough conformity
   unto it. That there are daily inroads made upon the ancient doctrine of
   this church, and that without the least control from them who pretend
   to be the sole conservators of it, until, if not the whole, yet the
   principal parts of it are laid waste, is sufficiently evident, and may
   be easily proved. And we fear not to own that we cannot conform to
   Arminianism [and] Socinianism, on the one hand, or Popery on the other,
   with what new or specious pretences soever they may be blended. And for
   the ecclesiastical government, as in the hands of our mere
   ecclesiastical persons, when it is agreed among themselves whether it
   be from heaven or of men, we shall know the better how to judge of it.
   But suppose we should waive all such considerations, and come up to a
   full conformity unto all that is, or shall, or may be required of us,
   will this give us a universally pleadable acquitment from the charges
   of the guilt of want of love, schism, and divisions? We should, indeed,
   possibly be delivered from the noise and clamour of a few crying-out
   sectaries, fanatics, schismatics, church-dividers; but withal should
   continue under the censures of the great, and at present thriving
   church of Rome, for the same supposed crimes. And sure enough we are,
   that a compliance with them who have been the real causes and occasions
   of all the schisms and divisions that are amongst Christians almost in
   the whole world, would yield us no solid relief in the change of our
   condition; yet without this no men can free themselves from the loudest
   outcries against them on the account of schism. And this sufficiently
   manifests how little indeed they are to be valued, seeing, for the most
   part, they are nothing but the steam of interest and party. It is
   therefore apparent, that the accommodations of our judgments and
   practices to the measures of other men will afford us no real advantage
   as to the imputations we suffer under, nor will give satisfaction unto
   all professors of Christianity that we pursue love and peace in a due
   manner: for what one sort requireth of us, another will instantly
   disallow and condemn; and it is well if the judgment of the major part
   of all sorts be not influenced by custom, prejudices, and secular
   advantages. We have, therefore, no way left but that which, indeed,
   ought to be the only way of Christians in these things, -- namely, to
   seek in sincerity the satisfaction of our own consciences, and the
   approving of our hearts unto the Searcher of them, in a diligent
   attendance unto our own especial duty, according to that rule which
   will neither deceive us nor fail us; and an account of what we do
   herein we shall now tender unto them that follow truth with peace.

Chapter II.

   Commendations of love and unity -- Their proper objects, with their
   general rules and measures -- Of love toward all mankind in general --
   Allows not salvation unto any without faith in Christ Jesus -- Of the
   differences in religion as to outward worship.

   The foundation of our discourse might be laid in the commendation of
   Christian love and unity, and thereon we might easily enlarge, as also
   abound in a collection of testimonies confirming our assertions; but
   the old reply in such a case, -- "By whom ever were they discommended?"
   -- evidenceth a labour therein to be needless and superfluous. We shall
   therefore only say, that they are greatly mistaken who, from the
   condition whereinto at present we are driven and necessitated, do
   suppose that we value not these things at as high a rate as themselves,
   or any other professors of Christian religion in the world. A greater
   noise about them may be made, possibly, by such as have accommodated
   their name and notion to their own interests, and who point their pleas
   about them and their pretences of them to their own secular advantage;
   but as for a real valuation of the things themselves, as they are
   required of us and prescribed unto us in the gospel, we shall not
   willingly be found to come behind any that own the name of Christ in
   the world. We know that God hath styled himself the God of love, peace,
   and order in the church, because they are eminently from him, and
   highly accepted with him. And as love is the new commandment which
   Jesus Christ hath given unto his disciples, so he hath appointed it to
   be the bond of perfection unto them; which nothing else will ever be,
   however finely invented for them, or forcibly imposed on them. Without
   this love, in what relates to church communion, whatever else we are,
   we are but as "sounding brass and tinkling cymbals." And all unity or
   agreement in outward order not proceeding from and animated by this
   love, are things wherein neither Christ nor the gospel is much
   concerned. An endeavour also after one mind and one judgment, Phil. ii.
   2, 1 Cor. i. 10, amongst all believers, for a help unto us to keep the
   "unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace," we acknowledge to be
   indispensably required of us. And, therefore, where any opinion or
   practice, in or about religion or the worship of God, do apparently in
   themselves impair the gracious, holy principles of love and peace, or
   obstruct men in the exercise of any duties which those principles
   require or lead unto, it is a great and weighty prejudice against their
   truth and acceptation with God. As, therefore, we shall not boast of
   the prevalency of these principles in our minds, seeing that, though we
   should know nothing to the contrary by ourselves, yet are we not
   therefore justified; so we are assured that none can justly condemn us
   for the want of them, unless they can make good their charge by
   instances not relating to the peculiar differences between them and us,
   for what doth so will neither warrant any to make such a judgment, nor
   carry any conviction in it towards them that are judged. Upon the whole
   matter, we shall not easily be diverted from pursuing our claim unto an
   equal interest in these things with any other professors of the
   Christian religion, although at present we do it not by enlarged
   commendations of them. Much less are we in the least moved or shaken in
   our minds from the accusations of them who, having the advantage of
   force and power, do make a compliance with themselves, in all their
   impositions and self-interested conceptions, the sole measure of other
   men's exercise and actings of these principles. We have a much safer
   rule whereby to make a judgment of them, whereunto we know "we shall do
   well to attend, as unto a light shining in a dark place." But, now,
   whereas all these things, -- namely, love, peace, and unity, -- are
   equally dear unto us, yet there are different rules prescribed for the
   exercise and pursuit of them. Our love is to be catholic, unconfined as
   the beams of the sun, or as the showers of rain that fall on the whole
   earth. Nothing of God's rational creation in this world is to be
   exempted from being the object thereof. And where only any exception
   might seem to be warranted by some men's causeless hatred, with unjust
   and unreasonable persecution of us, there the exercise of it is given
   us in especial and strictest charge; which is one of the noble
   singularities of Christian religion. But whereas men are cast into
   various conditions on account of their relation unto God, the actual
   exercise of love towards them is required of us in a suitable variety;
   for it is God himself, in his infinite excellencies, who is the first
   and adequate object of our love, which descends unto others according
   to their participation from him, and the especial relations created by
   his appointment; whereof we shall speak afterward. Our duty in the
   observance of peace is, as unto its object, equally extended; and the
   rule or measure given us herein is the utmost of our endeavours in all
   ways of truth and righteousness which are required or may have a
   tendency thereunto: for as we are commanded to "follow peace with all
   men," Heb. xii. 14, under the same indispensable necessity as to obtain
   and observe "holiness" in our own persons, "without which no man shall
   see the Lord;" so as to the measure of our endeavours unto this end, we
   are directed, "if it be possible, and as far as in us lieth, to live
   peaceably with all men," Rom. xii. 18. The rule for unity, as it is
   supposed to comprise all church-communion, falls under many
   restrictions; for herein the especial commands of Christ and
   institutions of the gospel committed unto our care and observance
   falling under consideration, our practice is precisely limited unto
   those commands and by the nature of those institutions.

   These being the things we are to attend unto, and these being their
   general rules and measures, we shall, with respect unto the present
   state of religious affairs in the world amongst those who make
   profession of the Christian religion, plainly declare what are our
   thoughts and judgments, what we conceive to be our duty, and what is
   our practice; submitting them unto the present apprehensions of
   unprejudiced persons, leaving the final sentence and determination of
   our cause to the judgment-seat of Jesus Christ.

   Love toward all mankind in general we acknowledge to be required of us,
   and we are debtors in the fruits of it to the whole creation of God:
   for he hath not only implanted the principles of it in that nature
   whereof we are in common partakers with the whole race and kind,
   whereunto all hatred and its effects were originally foreign, and
   introduced by the devil, nor only given us his command for it,
   enlarging on its grounds and reasons in the gospel; but in his design
   of recovering us out of our lapsed condition unto a conformity with
   himself, proposeth in an especial manner the example of his own love
   and goodness, which are extended unto all, for our imitation, Matt. v.
   44, 45. His philanthropy and communicative love, from his own infinite
   self-fullness, wherewith all creatures, in all places, times, and
   seasons, are filled and satisfied, as from an immeasurable ocean of
   goodness, are proposed unto us to direct the exercise of that drop from
   the divine nature wherewith we are intrusted. "Love your enemies,"
   saith our Saviour, "bless them that curse you, do good to them that
   hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute
   you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for
   he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain
   on the just and on the unjust." Now, all mankind may be cast into two
   ranks or orders: for, first, there are those who are yet "without
   Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers
   from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the
   world," Eph. ii. 12, -- such, we mean, as are either negatively or
   privatively infidels or unbelievers, who have yet never heard the sound
   of the gospel, or do continue to refuse and reject it where it is
   proposed and tendered unto them; and there are those, secondly, who
   have in one way or other received the doctrine of the gospel, and do
   make profession thereof in the world. To both these sorts we do
   acknowledge that we owe the duty of love. Even towards the infidel,
   pagan, and Mohammedan world, Jews and Gentiles, we are debtors in this
   duty; and we desire to be humbled for it as our sin, wherein we are
   wanting in the discharge of it, or wherein the fruits of it do not
   abound in us to the praise of God. Now, love, in the first notion of
   it, is the willing of a wanted good unto the object of it, or those
   that are loved, producing an endeavour to effect it unto the utmost of
   the ability of them in whom it is. Where this absent good is of great
   importance, the first natural and genuine effect of love is compassion.
   This good, as unto all unbelievers, is whatever should deliver them
   from present or eternal misery, -- whatever should lead, guide, or
   bring them unto blessedness in the enjoyment of God. Besides, the
   absence hereof is accompanied, even in this world, with all that
   blindness and darkness of mind, all that slavery unto sin and the
   devil, that can any way concur to make a rational being truly
   miserable. If we have not hearts like the flint or adamant, we cannot
   but be moved with compassion towards so many perishing souls,
   originally made like ourselves, in the image of God, and from whom that
   we differ in any thing is an effect of mere sovereign grace, and not
   the fruit of our own contrivance nor the reward of our worth or merit.
   And those who are altogether unconcerned in others are not much
   concerned in themselves; for the true love of ourselves is the rule of
   our love unto other men. Again, compassion proceeding from love will
   work by prayer for relief; for it is God alone who can supply their
   wants, and our only way of treating with him about it is by our humble
   supplications. And if herein also we should be found wanting, we should
   more judge ourselves to be defective in true Christian love and charity
   than we can for many of those mistakes which are charged on us in other
   things, were we convinced that such they are, which as yet we are not.
   It is therefore our continual prayer, that God would send out his light
   and his truth unto the utmost parts of the earth, to visit by them
   those dark places which are yet filled with habitations of cruelty;
   that he would remove the vail of covering which is yet on the face of
   many great and populous nations; that "the whole earth may be filled
   with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea;" even
   that, according to his promise, "he would turn to the people a pure
   language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve
   him with one consent." And this we desire to be found doing, not in a
   formal or customary manner, but out of a sincere compassion for the
   souls of men, a deep sense of the interest herein of the glory of God,
   and a desire after the accomplishment of those prophecies and promises
   in the Scripture which speak comfortably towards an expectation of
   abundant grace to be manifested unto the residue of sinners, both Jews
   and Gentiles, in the latter days. Moreover, unto compassion and
   supplications, love requireth that we should add also all other
   possible endeavours for their relief. Herein consists that work and
   labour of love which are so much recommended unto us. But the actings
   of love in these most useful ways are, for the most part, obstructed
   unto us by the want of opportunities; which, under the guidance of
   divine Providence, are the rule of our call unto the duties wherein
   such endeavours consist, and whereby they may be expressed. Only, this
   at present we have to rejoice in, that, through the unwearied labours
   of some holy and worthy persons, sundry churches of Indians are lately
   called and gathered in America; wherein the natives of those parts of
   the world, who for so many generations sat in darkness and in the
   shadow of death, do, under the guidance of pastors and elders of their
   own, walk in the fellowship of the gospel, giving glory to God by Jesus
   Christ. [2] And let it not seem impertinent that we have given this
   account of our judgments concerning that love which we do and ought to
   bear unto all, even the worst of men; seeing those by whom our
   testimony is received will not, nay cannot, easily suppose that we
   would willfully neglect the exercise of the same affections towards
   those concerning whom our obligations thereunto are unspeakably greater
   and more excellent.

   There is, indeed, another kind of pretended charity towards this sort
   of men, which we profess we have not for them, although we judge we do
   not want it; for there can be no want unto any of an error or mistake,
   wherein the charity intended doth consist. And this is the judgment of
   some, that they, or some of them, may attain salvation or eternal
   blessedness in the condition wherein they are, without the knowledge of
   Jesus Christ. This, we acknowledge, we neither believe nor hope
   concerning them; nor, to speak plainly, can desire it should be so,
   unless God had otherwise revealed himself concerning Jesus Christ and
   them than yet he hath done. And we are so far from supposing that there
   is in us, on this account, any blamable defect of charity, that we know
   ourselves to be freed by this persuasion from a dangerous error, which,
   if admitted, would both weaken our own faith and impair all the due and
   proper effects of charity towards others: for "though there be that are
   called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and
   lords many,) yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are
   all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
   things, and we by him," 1 Cor. viii. 5, 6. We know "there is no
   salvation in any other" but by Jesus Christ; and that "there is none
   other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved,"
   Acts iv. 12. Nor is this name given any otherwise amongst men but by
   the gospel; for it is not the giving of the person of Christ absolutely
   to be a mediator, but the declaration of his name by the gospel, as the
   means of salvation, that is intended. Hence our Lord Jesus Christ,
   giving that commission to his apostles to preach it, "Go ye into all
   the world, and preach the gospel to every creature," he adds unto it
   that decretory sentence concerning the everlasting condition of all men
   with respect thereunto, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be
   saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned," Mark xvi. 15, 16. As
   the preaching of the gospel, and the belief on Jesus Christ thereon,
   are the only means of obtaining salvation, so all those who are not
   made partakers of them must perish eternally. So when the apostle
   affirms that the Jews would have hindered them from preaching to the
   Gentiles "that they might be saved," 1 Thess. ii. 16, he plainly
   declares that without it they could not so be. Neither were any of them
   ever better, or in a better condition, than they are described by the
   same apostle, Eph. ii. 12, and in sundry other places, wherein he
   allows them no possibility of obtaining eternal blessedness. Neither do
   we in this matter consider what God can do, or what he hath done, to
   the communicating of grace and faith in Jesus Christ unto any
   particular persons at any time, or in any place, in an extraordinary
   manner. We are not called to make a judgment thereof, nor can any rule
   be hence collected to regulate the exercise of our love: "Secret things
   belong to the Lord our God, but revealed things to us and our children,
   that we may do his will." When and where such grace and faith do
   manifest themselves by their effects, we ought readily to own and
   embrace them. But the only inquiry in this matter is, what those that
   are utterly destitute of the revelation of Jesus Christ, either as made
   originally in the promise or as explained in the gospel, may, under the
   mere conduct of the light of nature, as consisting of the innate
   principles of reason, with their improvement, or as increased by the
   consideration of the effects of divine power and providence, by the
   strength and exercise of their own moral principles, attain unto, as
   unto their present acceptance with God and future eternal salvation?
   That they may be saved in every sect who live exactly according to the
   light of nature, is a doctrine anathematized by the church of England,
   article xviii.; and the reason given hereof is, because the Scriptures
   propose the name of Jesus Christ alone whereby we may be saved. And if
   we do believe that description which is given in the Scripture of men,
   their moral abilities and their works, as they lie in the common state
   of mankind since the entrance of sin, with respect unto God and
   salvation, we shall not be able to be of another mind: for they are
   said to be "blind," Luke iv. 18; yea, to be "darkness," to be "dead in
   trespasses and sins," not to "receive the things of the Spirit of God,
   because they are foolishness unto them," and their minds to be "enmity
   against God" himself, Acts xxvi. 18; Eph. ii. 1-3, iv. 18; Rom. viii.
   7. That there may be any just expectation concerning such persons, that
   they will "work out their salvation with fear and trembling," we are
   not convinced; neither do we think that God will accept of a more
   imperfect obedience in them that know not Jesus Christ than he requires
   of them who do believe in him, for then should he prove a disadvantage
   unto them. Besides, all their best works are severely reflected on in
   the Scripture, and represented as unprofitable; for whereas in
   themselves they are compared to evil trees, thorns, and briers, we are
   assured they neither do nor can bring forth good grapes or figs.
   Besides, in the Scripture the whole business of salvation, in the first
   place, turns upon the hinge of faith supernatural and divine: for
   "without faith it is impossible to please God," and "he that believeth
   not shall be damned;" "he that believeth not in the name of the Son of
   God is condemned already;" for "neither circumcision availeth any
   thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love;" and it is
   "by faith that the just shall live," Heb. xi. 6, [Mark xv. 16,] John
   iii. 18, 36, Gal. v. 6, [Hab. ii. 4.] That this faith may be educed out
   of the obediential principles of nature was, indeed, the opinion of
   Pelagius of old; but it will not now, we hope, be openly asserted by
   any. Moreover, this faith is in the Scripture, if not limited and
   determined, yet directed unto Jesus Christ as its necessary peculiar
   object: "For this is life eternal, that we may know the only true God,
   and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent." It seems, therefore, that the
   knowledge of the only true God is not sufficient to attain eternal
   life, unless the knowledge of Jesus Christ also do accompany it; for
   "this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this
   life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath
   not the Son of God hath not life," 1 John v. 11, 12; which is enough to
   determine the controversy. And those assertions, that "there is none
   other name given among men whereby they must be saved," and that "other
   foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ,"
   Acts iv. 12, 1 Cor. iii. 11, are of the same importance; and it were
   needless to multiply the testimonies that are given us to that purpose
   elsewhere. Neither can it be made to appear that the concatenation of
   the saving means, whereby men that are adult are brought unto glory, is
   not absolutely universal; and amongst them there is vocation, or an
   effectual calling (Rom. viii. 29, 30) to the knowledge of Christ by the
   gospel. Neither will the same apostle allow a saving invocation of the
   name of God to any but those that are brought to believe by hearing the
   word preached, Rom. x. 13-15. It is said that God may, by ways secret
   and unknown to us, reveal Jesus Christ to them, and so by faith in him
   sanctify their natures and endow them with his Spirit; which things it
   is granted, we suppose, are indispensably necessary unto salvation.
   Those whom God thus deals withal are not Pagans but Christians,
   concerning whom none ever doubted but they might be saved. It is also
   granted that men may learn much of the power, wisdom, and goodness of
   God, which both require and teach many duties to be performed towards
   him; but withal, we believe that without the internal sanctification of
   the Spirit, communicated by and with the knowledge of Jesus Christ, no
   man can be saved. But we intend not here to dispute about these things.
   Instead of an effect of love and charity, it is manifest that the
   opinion which grants salvation unto the heathen, or any of them, upon
   the due improvement of their rational faculties and moral principles,
   ariseth from a want of due consideration of the true nature of sin and
   grace, of the fall of man and his recovery, of the law and gospel, and
   of the wisdom and love of God in sending Jesus Christ to make atonement
   for sinners, and to bring in everlasting righteousness. And not only
   so, but it evidently prepares the way unto those noxious opinions which
   at this day among, many infest and corrupt Christian religion, and
   foment those seeds of atheism which spring up so fast as to threaten
   the overspreading of the whole field of Christianity; for hence it will
   follow, by an easy deduction, that every one may be saved, or attain
   unto his utmost happiness, in his own religion, be it what it will,
   whilst under any notion or conception he acknowledgeth a divine Being,
   and his own dependence thereon. And seeing that, on this supposition,
   it must be confessed that religion consists solely in moral honesty,
   and a fancied internal piety of mind towards the Deity (for in nothing
   else can a centring of all religions in the world unto a certain end be
   imagined), it follows that there is no outward profession of it
   indispensably necessary, but that every man may take up and make use of
   that which is best suited unto his interest in his present condition
   and circumstances. And as this, being once admitted, will give the
   minds of men an indifferency as unto the several religions that are in
   the world, so it will quickly produce in them a contempt of them all.
   And, from an entertainment of, or an indifferency of mind about, these
   and the like noisome opinions, it is come to pass that the gospel,
   after a continued triumph for sixteen hundred years over hell and the
   world, doth at this day, in the midst of Christendom, hardly with
   multitudes maintain the reputation of its truth and divinity; and is by
   many, living in a kind of outward conformity unto the institutes of
   Christian religion, despised and laughed to scorn. But the proud and
   foolish atheistical opiniators of our days, whose sole design is to
   fortify themselves by the darkness of their minds against the charges
   of their own conscience upon their wicked and debauched conversations,
   do but expose themselves to the scorn of all sober and rational
   persons; for what are a few obscure, and, for the most part, vicious
   renegadoes, in comparison of those great, wise, numerous, and sober
   persons, whom the gospel, in its first setting forth in the world, by
   the evidence of its truth and the efficacy of its power, subdued and
   conquered? Are they as learned as the renowned philosophers of those
   days, who, advantaged by the endeavours and fruits of all the great
   wits of former ages, had advanced solid, rational literature to the
   greatest height that ever it attained in this world, or possibly ever
   will do so, the minds of men having now something more excellent and
   noble to entertain themselves withal? Are they to be equalled in wisdom
   and experience with those glorious emperors, senators, and princes who
   then swayed the scepters and affairs of the world? Can they produce any
   thing to oppose unto the gospel that is likely to influence the minds
   of men in any degree comparably to the religion of these great,
   learned, wise, and mighty personages; which, having received by their
   fathers from days immemorial, was visibly attended with all earthly
   glories and prosperities, which were accounted as the reward of their
   due observance of it? And yet, whereas there was a conspiracy of all
   those persons, and this influenced by the craft of infernal powers, and
   managed with all that wisdom, subtlety, power, and cruelty that the
   nature of man is capable to exercise, on purpose to oppose the gospel,
   and keep it from taking root in the world; yet, by the glorious
   evidence of its divine extract and original wherewith it is
   accompanied, by the efficacy and power which God gave the doctrine of
   it in and over the minds of men, all managed by the spiritual weapons
   of its preachers, which were "mighty through God to the pulling down of
   those strongholds, casting down imaginations, and every high thing that
   exalted itself against, the knowledge of God," 2 Cor. x. 4, 5, it
   prevailed against them all, and subdued the world unto an
   acknowledgment of its truth, with the divine power and authority of its
   Author. Certainly there is nothing more contemptible than that the
   indulgence of some inconsiderable persons unto their lusts and vices,
   who are void of all those excellencies, in notion and practice, which
   have already been triumphed over by the gospel when set up in
   competition with it or opposition unto it, should be once imagined to
   bring it into question or to cast any disreputation upon it. But to
   treat of these things is not our present design; we have only mentioned
   them occasionally, in the account which it was necessary we should give
   concerning our love to all men in general, with the grounds we proceed
   upon in the exercise of it.

   [2] So early as 1556, some missionaries were sent to labour among the
   natives of America by the church of Geneva, and this is affirmed to
   have been the first protestant mission. In 1644, a petition was
   presented to the English parliament in favour of a similar mission to
   America, and an ordinance of the Lords and Commons was passed,
   authorizing the Earl of Warwick to take measures in furtherance of this
   object. "The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England,"
   was established in 1649, by the authority of parliament. Eliot
   distinguished himself as "the apostle of the Indians," and three
   authentic narratives were published, in 1653, 1655, and 1659, giving an
   account of the remarkable success which had attended his labours,
   containing several sermons by Indian converts, and mentioning several
   villages in which the inhabitants had wholly conformed to the
   principles and usages of Christianity. It is interesting to notice the
   germ of the vast system of modern missions; and when a disposition has
   been manifested to reproach our fathers for indifference to this great
   work, it is well to find that Owen was fully alive to its importance,
   and that the pressure of circumstances alone hindered British
   Christians in his day from engaging in it on a scale worthy alike of
   its momentous nature and their own eagerness to advance it. -- Ed.

Chapter III.

   Nature of the catholic church -- The first and principal object of
   Christian love -- Differences among the members of this church, of what
   nature, and how to be managed -- Of the church catholic as visibly
   professing -- The extent of it, or who belong unto it -- Of union and
   love in this church-state -- Of the church of England with respect
   hereunto -- Of particular churches; their institution; corruption of
   that institution -- Of churches diocesan, etc. -- Of separation from
   corrupt particular churches -- The just causes thereof, etc.

   In the second sort of mankind, before mentioned, consists the visible
   kingdom of Christ in this world. This being grounded in his death and
   resurrection, and conspicuously settled by his sending of the Holy
   Ghost after his ascension, he hath ever since preserved in the world
   against all the contrivances of Satan or opposition of the gates of
   hell, and will do so unto the consummation of all things; for "he must
   reign until all his enemies are made his footstool." Towards these, on
   all accounts, our love ought to be intense and fervent, as that which
   is the immediate bond of our relation unto them and union with them.
   And this kingdom or church of Christ on the earth may be, and is
   generally, by all considered under a three-fold notion:--First, As
   therein, and among the members of it, is comprised that real living and
   spiritual body of his, which is firstly, peculiarly, and properly the
   catholic church militant in this world. These are his elect, redeemed,
   justified, and sanctified ones, who are savingly united unto their head
   by the same quickening and sanctifying Spirit, dwelling in him in all
   fulness, and communicated unto them by him according to his promise.
   This is that catholic church which we profess to believe; which being
   hid from the eyes of men, and absolutely invisible in its mystical
   form, or spiritual saving relation unto the Lord Christ and its unity
   with him, is yet more or less always visible by that profession of
   faith in him and obedience unto him which it maketh in the world, and
   is always obliged so to do: "For with the heart man believeth unto
   righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation,"
   Rom. x. 10. And this church we believe to be so disposed over the whole
   world, that wherever there are any societies or numbers of men who
   ordinarily profess the gospel, and subjection to the kingly rule of
   Christ thereby, with a hope of eternal blessedness by his mediation, we
   no way doubt but that there are among them some who really belong
   thereunto. In and by them doth the Lord Christ continually fulfil and
   accomplish the promise of his presence by his Spirit with them that
   believe in his name; who are thereby interested in all the privileges
   of the gospel, and authorized unto the administration and participation
   of all the holy ordinances thereof. And were it not that we ought not
   to boast ourselves against others, especially such as have not had the
   spiritual advantages that the inhabitants of these nations have been
   intrusted withal, and who have been exposed unto more violent
   temptations than they, we should not fear to say, that among those of
   all sorts who in these nations hold the Head, there is probably,
   according unto a judgment to be made by the fruits of that Spirit which
   is savingly communicated unto the church in this sense alone, a greater
   number of persons belonging thereunto than in any one nation or church
   under heaven. The charge therefore of some against us that we paganize
   the nation, by reason of some different apprehensions from others
   concerning the regular constitution of particular churches for the
   celebration of gospel worship, is wondrous vain and ungrounded. But we
   know that men use such severe expressions and reflections out of a
   discomposed habit of mind, which they have accustomed themselves unto,
   and not from a sedate judgment and consideration of the things
   themselves; and hence they will labour to convince others of that
   whereof, if they would put it unto a serious trial, they would never be
   able to convince themselves.

   This, then, is that church which, on the account of their sincere faith
   and obedience, shall be saved, and out of which, on the account of
   their profession, there is no salvation to be obtained: which things
   are weakly and arrogantly appropriated unto any particular church or
   churches in the world; for it is possible that men may be members of
   it, and yet not belong or relate unto any particular church on the
   earth; and so it often falleth out, as we could manifest by instances,
   did that work now lie before us. This is the church which the Lord
   Christ "loved and gave himself for; that he might sanctify and cleanse
   it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it unto
   himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
   thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish," Eph. v. 26, 27.
   And we must acknowledge that in all things this is the church unto
   which we have our first and principal regard, as being the spring from
   which all other considerations of the church do flow. Within the verge
   and compass of it do we endeavour to be found, the end of the
   dispensation of the gospel unto men being that they should do so.
   Neither would we, to save our lives (which, for the members of this
   church and their good, we are bound to lay down, 1 John iii. 16, when
   justly called thereunto), willfully live in the neglect of that love
   towards them or any of them which we hope God hath planted in our
   hearts, and made natural unto us, by that one and selfsame Spirit, by
   whom the whole mystical body of Christ is animated. We do confess,
   that, because the best of men in this life do know but in part, all the
   members of this church are in many things liable to error, mistakes,
   and miscarriages; and hence it is that, although they are all
   internally acted and guided by the same Spirit in all things absolutely
   necessary to their eternal salvation, and do all attend unto the same
   rule of the word, according as they apprehend the mind of God in it and
   concerning it, have all, for the nature and substance of it, the same
   divine faith and love, and are all equally united unto their Head, yet,
   in the profession which they make of the conceptions and persuasions of
   their minds about the things revealed in the Scripture, there are, and
   always have been, many differences among them. Neither is it morally
   possible it should be otherwise, whilst in their judgment and
   profession they are left unto the ability of their own minds and
   liberty of their wills, under that great variety of the means of light
   and truth, with other circumstances, whereinto they are disposed by the
   holy wise providence of God. Nor hath the Lord Christ absolutely
   promised that it shall be otherwise with them; but securing them all by
   his Spirit in the foundations of eternal salvation, he leaves them in
   other things to the exercise of mutual love and forbearance, with a
   charge of duty after a continual endeavour to grow up unto a perfect
   union, by the improvement of the blessed aids and assistances which he
   is pleased to afford unto them. And those who, by ways of force, would
   drive them into any other union or agreement than their own light and
   duty will lead them into, do what in them lies to oppose the whole
   design of the Lord Christ towards them and his rule over them. In the
   meantime, it is granted that they may fall into divisions, and schisms,
   and mutual exasperations among themselves, through the remainders of
   darkness in their minds and the infirmity of the flesh, Rom. xiv. 3;
   and in such cases mutual judgings and despisings are apt to ensue, and
   that to the prejudice and great disadvantage of that common faith which
   they do profess. And yet, notwithstanding all this (such
   cross-entangled wheels are there in the course of our nature), they all
   of them really value and esteem the things wherein they agree
   incomparably above those wherein they differ. But their valuation of
   the matter of their union and agreement is purely spiritual, whereas
   their differences are usually influenced by carnal and secular
   considerations, which have, for the most part, a sensible impression on
   the minds of poor mortals. But so far as their divisions and
   differences are unto them unavoidable, the remedy of farther evils
   proceeding from them is plainly and frequently expressed in the
   Scripture. It is love, meekness, forbearance, bowels of compassion,
   with those other graces of the Spirit wherein our conformity unto
   Christ doth consist, with a true understanding and the due valuation of
   the "unity of faith," and the common hope of believers, which are the
   ways prescribed unto us for the prevention of those evils which,
   without them, our unavoidable differences will occasion. And this
   excellent way of the gospel, together with a rejection of evil
   surmises, and a watchfulness over ourselves against irregular judging
   and censuring of others, together with a peaceable walking in consent
   and unity so far as we have attained, is so fully and clearly proposed
   unto us therein, that they must have their eyes blinded by prejudices
   and carnal interests, or some effectual working of the god of this
   world on their minds, into whose understandings the light of it doth
   not shine with uncontrollable evidence and conviction. That the sons or
   children of this church, of "Jerusalem which is above, and is the
   mother of us all," should, on the account of their various
   apprehensions of some things relating to religion or the worship of
   God, unavoidably attending their frail and imperfect condition in this
   world, yea, or of any schisms or divisions ensuing thereon, proceeding
   from corrupt and not thoroughly mortified affections, be warranted to
   hate, judge, despise, or condemn one another, much more to strive by
   external force to coerce, punish, or destroy them that differ from
   them, is as foreign to the gospel as that we should believe in Mohammed
   and not in Jesus Christ. Whatever share, therefore, we are forced to
   bear in differences with or divisions from the members of this church
   (that is, any who declare and evidence themselves so to be by a visible
   and regular profession of faith and obedience), as it is a continual
   sorrow and trouble unto us, so we acknowledge it to be our duty (and
   shall be willing to undergo any blame, where we are found defective in
   the discharge of it, unto the utmost of our power) to endeavour after
   the strictest communion with them in all spiritual things that the
   gospel doth require, or whereof our condition in this world is capable.
   In the meantime, until this can be attained, it is our desire to manage
   the profession of our own light and apprehensions without anger,
   bitterness, clamour, evil speaking, or any other thing that may be
   irregular in ourselves or give just cause of offence unto others. Our
   prayers are also continually for the spiritual prosperity of this
   church, for its increase in faith and holiness, and especially for the
   healing of all breaches that are among them that belong thereunto
   throughout the world. And were we not satisfied that the principles
   which we own about the right constitution of the churches of Christ,
   and the worship of God to be observed in them, are singularly suited to
   the furtherance and preservation of union and due order among all the
   members of this church, we should not need to be excited by any unto
   their renunciation. But our main design in all these things is, that
   both they and we with them may enjoy that peace which the Lord Christ
   hath bequeathed unto us, and walk in the way which he hath prescribed
   for us. And these things we mention, neither to boast of nor yet to
   justify ourselves, but only to acknowledge what is our conviction
   concerning our duty in this matter. And might there any sedate,
   peaceable, unprejudicate endeavours be countenanced and encouraged, for
   the allaying of all occasional distempers and the composing of all
   differences among them who belong to this church of Christ, so as that
   they might all of them (at least in these nations) not only "keep the
   unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace," but also agree and consent
   in all ways and acts of religious communion, we doubt not to manifest
   that no rigid adherence unto the practice of any conceptions of our
   own, in things wherein the gospel alloweth a condescension and
   forbearance, no delight in singularity, no prejudice against persons or
   things, should obstruct us in the promotion of it to the utmost of our
   power and ability. Upon the whole matter, we own it as our duty to
   follow and seek after peace, unity, consent and agreement in holy
   worship, with all the members of this church, or those who, by a
   regular profession, manifest themselves so to be; and will, with all
   readiness and alacrity, renounce every principle or practice that is
   either inconsistent with such communion, or directly or indirectly is
   in itself obstructive of it.

   Secondly, The church of Christ may be considered with respect unto its
   outward profession, as constitutive of its being, and the formal reason
   of its denomination. And this is the church catholic visible, whereunto
   they all universally belong who profess the invocation of the name of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours, under the limitations that
   shall be mentioned afterward. And this is the visible kingdom of
   Christ; which, on the account of its profession, and thereby, is
   distinguished from that world which lieth in evil and is absolutely
   under the power of Satan. And so in common use the church and the world
   are contradistinguished. Yet, on other accounts, many who belong unto
   this church, by reason of some kind of profession that they make, may
   justly be esteemed to be the world, or of it. So our Lord Jesus Christ
   called the generality of the professing church in his time. "The
   world," saith he, "hateth me," John xvii. 18, 19, 25. And that we may
   know that he thereby intended the church of the Jews, besides that the
   circumstances of the place evince it, he puts it out of question by the
   testimony which he produceth in the confirmation of his assertion
   concerning their unjust and causeless hatred, -- namely, "It is written
   in their law, They hated me without a cause;" which, being taken out of
   the Psalms (Ps. xxxv. 19), was part of the law or rule of the Judaical
   church only. Now, he thus terms them, because the generality of them,
   especially their rulers, although they professed to know God, and to
   worship him according to his word and the tradition of their fathers,
   yet were not only corrupt and wicked in their lives, but also
   persecuted him and his disciples, in whom the power and truth of God
   were manifested beyond what they were able to bear. And hence a general
   rule is established: That what profession soever any men do make of the
   knowledge and worship of God, to what church soever they do or may be
   thought to belong, yet if they are wicked or ungodly in their lives,
   and persecutors of such as are better than themselves, they are really
   of the world, and with it will perish, without repentance. These are
   they who, receiving on them a form or delineation of godliness, do yet
   deny the power of it; from whom we are commanded to "turn away." But
   yet we acknowledge that there is a real difference to be made between
   them who in any way or manner make profession of the name of Christ,
   with subjection unto him, and that infidel world by whom the gospel is
   totally rejected, or to whom it was never tendered.

   In this catholic visible church, as comprehensive of all who throughout
   the world outwardly own the gospel, there is an acknowledgment of "one
   Lord, one faith, one baptism:" which are a sufficient foundation of
   that love, union, and communion among them, which they are capable of,
   or are required of them; for in the joint profession of the same Lord,
   faith, and baptism, consists the union of the church under this
   consideration, -- that is, as catholic and visibly professing, -- and
   in nothing else. And hereunto also is required, as the principle
   animating that communion, and rendering it acceptable, mutual love with
   its occasional exercise, as a fruit of that love which we have unto
   Jesus Christ, who is the object of our common profession. And setting
   aside the consideration of them who openly reject the principal
   fundamentals of Christian religion (as denying the Lord Christ to be
   the eternal Son of God, with the use and efficacy of his death, as also
   the personal subsistence and deity of the Holy Spirit), there is no
   known community of these professors in the world but they own so much
   of the truths concerning "one Lord, one faith, and one baptism," as is
   sufficient to guide them unto life and salvation. And thereon we no way
   doubt but that among them all there are some really belonging to the
   purpose of God's election, who by the means that they do enjoy shall at
   length be brought unto everlasting glory: for we do not think that God,
   by his providence, would maintain the dispensation of the gospel in any
   place, or among any people, among whom there are none whom he hath
   designed to bring into the enjoyment of himself; for that is the rule
   of his sending and continuing of it, whereon he enjoined the apostle
   Paul to stay in such places where he had "much people" whom he would
   have to be converted, Acts xviii. 9-11. He would not continue from
   generation to generation to scatter his pearls where there were none
   but rending swine, nor send fishers unto waters wherein he knew there
   were nothing but serpents and vipers. It is true the gospel, as
   preached unto many, is only a testimony against them, Matt. xxiv. 14,
   leaving them without excuse, and proves unto them "a savour of death
   unto death." But the first, direct, and principal design of the
   dispensation of it being the conversion of souls and their eternal
   salvation, it will not probably be continued in any place, nor is so,
   where this design is not pursued nor accomplished towards any; neither
   will God make use of it anywhere merely for the aggravation of men's
   sins and condemnation; nor would his so doing consist with the honour
   of the gospel itself, or the glory of that love and grace which it
   professeth to declare. Where it is indeed openly rejected, there that
   shall be the condemnation of men; but where it finds any admittance,
   there it hath somewhat of its genuine and proper work to effect. And
   the gospel is esteemed to be in all places dispensed and admitted,
   where, the Scripture being received as the word of God, men are, from
   the light, truth, and doctrine contained therein, by any means so far
   instructed as to take upon them the profession of subjecting their
   souls to Jesus Christ, and of observing the religious duties by him
   prescribed, in opposition to all false religions in the world. Amongst
   all these the foundations of saving faith are at this day preserved;
   for they universally receive the whole canonical Scripture, and
   acknowledge it to be the word of God, on such motives as prevail with
   them to do so sincerely. Herein they give a tacit consent unto the
   whole truth contained in it, for they receive it as from God, without
   exception or limitation; and this they cannot do without a general
   renunciation of all the falsities and evils that it doth condemn. Where
   these things concur, men will not believe nor practice any thing in
   religion but what they think God requires of them and will accept from
   them. And we find it also in the event, that all the persons spoken of,
   wherever they are, do universally profess that they believe in the God
   and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in his only and eternal Son.
   They all look, also, for salvation by him, and profess obedience unto
   him, believing that God raised him from the dead. They believe, in like
   manner, that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Father and the Son,
   with many other sacred truths of the same importance; as also, that
   "without holiness no man shall see the Lord." However, therefore, they
   are differenced and divided among themselves, however they are mutually
   esteemed heretics and schismatics, however, through the subtlety of
   Satan, they are excited and provoked to curse and persecute one another
   with wonderful folly, and by an open contradiction unto other
   principles which they profess; yet are they all subjects of the visible
   kingdom of Christ, and belong all of them to the catholic church,
   making profession of the name of Christ in the world, in which there is
   salvation to be obtained, and out of which there is none.

   We take not any consideration at present of that absurd, foolish, and
   uncharitable error, which would confine the catholic church of Christ
   unto a particular church of one single denomination, or, indeed, rather
   unto a combination of some persons in an outward mode of religious rule
   and worship; whereof the Scripture is as silent as of things that never
   were, nor ever shall be. Yea, we look upon it as intolerable
   presumption, and the utmost height of uncharitableness, for any to
   judge that the constant profession of the name of Christ made by
   multitudes of Christians, with the lasting miseries and frequent
   martyrdoms which for his sake they undergo, should turn unto no
   advantage, either of the glory of God or their own eternal blessedness,
   because in some things they differ from them. Yet such is the judgment
   of those of the church of Rome, and so are they bound to judge by the
   fundamental principles and laws of their church-communion. But men
   ought to fear lest they should meet with "judgment without mercy, who
   have shewed no mercy," James ii. 13. Had we ever entertained a thought
   uncharitable to such a prodigy of insolence, had we ever excluded any
   sort of Christians absolutely from an interest in the love of God or
   grace in Jesus Christ, or hope of salvation, because they do not or
   will not comply with those ways and terms of outward church-communion
   which we approve of, we should judge ourselves as highly criminal, in
   want of Christian love, as any can desire to have us esteemed so to be.

   It is, then, the universal collective body of them that profess the
   gospel throughout the world which we own as the catholic church of
   Christ. How far the errors in judgment, or miscarriages in sacred
   worship, which any of them have superadded unto the foundations of
   truth which they do profess, may be of so pernicious a nature as to
   hinder them from an interest in the covenant of God, and so prejudice
   their eternal salvation, God only knows. But those notices which we
   have concerning the nature and will of God in the Scriptures, as also
   of the love, care, and compassion of Jesus Christ, with the ends of his
   mediation, do persuade us to believe that where men in sincerity do
   improve the abilities and means of the knowledge of divine truth
   wherewith they are intrusted, endeavouring withal to answer their light
   and convictions with a suitable obedience, there are but few errors of
   the mind of so malignant a nature as absolutely to exclude such persons
   from an interest in eternal mercy. And we doubt not but that men, out
   of a zeal to the glory of God, real or pretended, have imprisoned,
   banished, killed, burned others for such errors as it hath been the
   glory of God to pardon in them, and which he hath done accordingly. But
   this we must grant, and do, that those whose lives and conversations
   are no way influenced by the power of the gospel, so as to be brought
   to some conformity thereunto, or who, under the covert of a Christian
   profession, do give themselves up unto idolatry and persecution of the
   true worshippers of God, are no otherwise to be esteemed but as enemies
   to the cross of Christ; for as "without holiness no man shall see the
   Lord," so "no idolater or murderer hath eternal life abiding in him,"
   Heb. xii. 14; Rev. xxi. 8; 1 John iii. 15.

   With respect unto these things we look upon the church of England, or
   the generality of the nation professing Christian religion (measuring
   them by the doctrine that hath been preached unto them and received by
   them since the Reformation), to be as sound and healthful a part of the
   catholic church as any in the world; for we know no place nor nation
   where the gospel for so long a season hath been preached with more
   diligence, power, and evidence for conviction, nor where it hath
   obtained a greater success or acceptation. Those, therefore, who perish
   amongst us, do not do so for want of truth and a right belief, or
   miscarriages in sacred worship, but for their own personal infidelity
   and disobedience; for according to the rules before laid down, we do
   not judge that there are any such errors publicly admitted among them,
   nor any such miscarriages in sacred administration, as should directly
   or absolutely hinder their eternal salvation. That they be not any of
   them, through the ignorance or negligence of those who take upon them
   the conduct of their souls, encouraged in a state or way of sin, or
   deprived of due advantages to further their spiritual good, or led into
   practices in religion neither acceptable unto God nor tending to their
   own edification, whereby they may be betrayed into eternal ruin, is
   greatly incumbent on themselves to consider.

   Unto this catholic church we owe all Christian love, and are obliged to
   exercise all the effects of it, both towards the whole and every
   particular member, as we have advantage and occasion. And not only so,
   but it is our duty to live in constant communion with it. This we can
   no otherwise do but by a profession of that faith whereby it becomes
   the church of Christ in the notion under consideration. For any failure
   herein we are not, that we know of, charged by any persons of modesty
   or sobriety. The reflections that have been made of late by some on the
   doctrines we teach or own, do fall as severely on the generality of the
   church of England (at least until within a few years last past) as they
   do on us; and we shall not need to own any especial concernment in them
   until they are publicly discountenanced by others. Such are the
   doctrines concerning God's eternal decrees, justification by faith, the
   loss of original grace, and the corruption of nature, the nature of
   regeneration, the power and efficacy of grace in the conversion of
   sinners, that we say not of the Trinity and satisfaction of Christ. But
   we do not think that the doctrines publicly taught and owned among us
   ever since the Reformation will receive any great damage by the
   impotent assaults of some few, especially considering their management
   of those assaults by tales, railing, and raillery, to the lasting
   reproach of the religion which themselves profess, be it what it will.

   Thirdly, The church of Christ, or the visible professors of the gospel
   in the world, may be considered as they are disposed of by providence,
   or their own choice, in particular churches. These at present are of
   many sorts, or are esteemed so to be; for whereas the Lord Christ hath
   instituted sundry solemn ordinances of divine worship to be observed
   jointly by his disciples, unto his honour and their edification, this
   could not be done but in such societies, communities, or assemblies of
   them to that purpose. And as none of them can be duly performed but in
   and by such societies, so some of them do either express the union,
   love, and common hope that is among them, or do consist in the means of
   their preservation. Of this latter sort are all the ways whereby the
   power of Christ is acted in the discipline of the churches. Wherefore,
   we believe that our Lord Jesus Christ, as the king, ruler, and lawgiver
   of his church, hath ordained that all his disciples, all persons
   belonging unto his church in the former notion of it, should be
   gathered into distinct societies, and become as flocks of sheep in
   several folds, under the eye of their great Shepherd and the respective
   conducts of those employed under him. And this conjunction of
   professors in and unto particular churches, for the celebration of the
   ordinances of sacred worship appointed by Christ, and the participation
   of his institutions for their edification, is not a matter of accident,
   or merely under the disposal of common providence, but is to be an act
   in them of choice and voluntary obedience unto the commands of Christ.
   By some this duty is more expressly attended unto than by others, and
   by some it is totally neglected; for neither antecedently nor
   consequentially unto such their conjunction do they consider what is
   their duty unto the Lord Christ therein, nor what is most meet for
   their own edification. They go on in these things with others,
   according to the customs of the times and places wherein they live,
   confounding their civil and spiritual relations. And these we cannot
   but judge to walk irregularly, through ignorance, mistakes, or
   prejudices. Neither will they in their least secular concernments
   behave themselves with so much regardlessness or negligence; for
   however their lot previously unto their own choice may be cast into any
   place or society, they will make an after-judgment whether it be to
   their advantage, according to the rules of prudence, and by that
   judgment either abide in their first station, or otherwise dispose of
   themselves. But a liberty of this nature, regulated by the gospel, to
   be exercised in and about the great concernments of men's souls, is by
   many denied and by most neglected. Hence it is come to pass that the
   societies of Christians are for the most part mere effects of their
   political distributions by civil laws, aiming principally at other ends
   and purposes. It is not denied but that civil distributions of
   professors of the gospel may be subservient unto the ends of religious
   societies and assemblies; but when they are made a means to take off
   the minds of men from all regard to the authority of the Lord Christ
   instituting and appointing such societies, they are of no small
   disadvantage unto true church communion and love.

   The institution of these churches, and the rules for their disposal and
   government throughout the world, are the same, -- stable and
   unalterable. And hence there was in the first churches, planted by the
   apostles, and those who next succeeded them in the care of that work,
   great peace, union, and agreement; for they were all gathered and
   planted alike, according unto the institution of Christ, all regulated
   and ordered by the same common rule. Men had not yet found out those
   things which were the causes of differences in after ages, and which
   yet continue so to be. Where there was any difference, it was for the
   most part on the account of some noisome, foolish, fantastical
   opinions, vented by impostors, in direct opposition to the Scripture;
   which the generality of Christians did with one consent abhor. But on
   various occasions, and by sundry degrees, there came to be great
   variety in the conceptions of men about these particular churches
   appointed for the seat and subject of all gospel ordinances, and
   wherein they were authoritatively to be administered in the name of
   Jesus Christ; for the church in neither of the former notions is
   capable of such administrations. Some, therefore, rested in particular
   assemblies, or such societies who did or might meet together under the
   guidance and inspection of their own elders, overseers, guides, or
   bishops, Acts xiv. 23, xx. 28; 1 Pet. v. 1-3; Acts xv. 2; Phil. i. 1.
   And hereunto they added the occasional meetings of those elders and
   others, to advise and determine in common about the especial
   necessities of any particular church, or the general concernments of
   more of them, as the matter might require. These in name, and some kind
   of resemblance, are continued throughout the world in parochial
   assemblies. Others suppose a particular church to be such a one as is
   now called diocesan, though that name in its first use and application
   to church affairs was of a larger extent than what is is now applied
   unto, for it was of old the name of a patriarchal church. And herein
   the sole rule, guidance, and authoritative inspection of many, perhaps
   a multitude of particular churches, assembling for sacred worship and
   the administration of gospel ordinances distinctly, is committed unto
   one man, whom, in contradistinction from others, they call the Bishop:
   for the joining of others with him, or their subordination unto him in
   the exercise of jurisdiction, hinders not but that the sole
   ecclesiastical power of the diocese may be thought to reside in him
   alone; for those others do either act in his name or by power derived
   from him, or have no pretence unto any authority merely ecclesiastical,
   however in common use what they exercise may be so termed. But the
   nature of such churches, with the rule and discipline exercised in them
   and over them, is too well known to be here insisted on. Some rest not
   here, but unto these diocesan add metropolitan churches; which also are
   esteemed particular churches, though it be uncertain by what warrant or
   on what grounds. In these one person hath in some kind of resemblance a
   respect unto and over the diocesan bishops, like that which they have
   over the ministers of particular assemblies. But these things being
   animated and regulated by certain arbitrary rules and canons, or civil
   laws of the nations, the due bounds and extent, of their power cannot
   be taken from any nature or constitution peculiar unto them; and
   therefore are there, wherever they are admitted, various degrees in
   their elevation. But how much or little the gospel is concerned in
   these things is easy for any one to judge; neither is it by wise men
   pretended to be so, any farther than that, as they suppose, it hath
   left such things to be ordered by human wisdom for an expediency unto
   some certain ends. One or more of these metropolitan churches have been
   required, in latter ages, to constitute a church national: though the
   truth is, that appellation had originally another occasion, whereunto
   the invention of these metropolitan churches was accommodated; for it
   arose not from any respect unto ecclesiastical order or rule, but unto
   the supreme political power, whereunto the inhabitants of such a nation
   as gives denomination to the church are civilly subject. Hence, that
   which was provincial at the first erection of this fabric, which was in
   the Romish empire whilst the whole was under the power of one monarch,
   became national when the several provinces were turned into kingdoms,
   with absolute sovereign power among themselves, wholly independent of
   any other. And he who, in his own person and authority, would erect an
   ecclesiastical image of that demolished empire, will allow of such
   provincial churches as have a dependence upon himself, but cares not to
   hear of such national churches as in their first notion include a
   sovereign power unto all intents and purposes within themselves: so the
   church of England became national in the days of King Henry VIII.,
   which before was but provincial.

   Moreover, the consent of many had prevailed that there should be
   patriarchal churches, comprehending under their inspection and
   jurisdiction many of these metropolitical and provincial churches. And
   these also were looked on as particular; for, from their first
   invention, there having been four or five of them, no one of them could
   be imagined to comprise the catholic church, although those who
   presided in them, according to the pride and vanity of the declining
   ages of the church, styled themselves OEcumenical and Catholic. Things
   being carried thus far, about the fifth and sixth century of years
   after Christ, one owned as principal or chief of this latter sort set
   up for a church denominated Papal, from a title he had appropriated
   unto himself; for by artifices innumerable he ceased not from
   endeavouring to subject all those other churches and their rulers unto
   himself, and by the advantage of his pre-eminence over the other
   patriarchs, as theirs over metropolitans, and so downwards, whereby all
   Christians were imagined to be comprised within the precincts of some
   of them, he fell into a claim of a sovereignty over the whole body of
   Christianity, and every particular member thereunto belonging. This he
   could have had no pretence for, but that he thought them cast into such
   an order as that he might possess them on the same grounds on which
   that order itself was framed; for had not diocesan, metropolitical, and
   patriarchal churches made way for it, the thought of a church papal,
   comprehensive of all believers, had never befallen the minds of men;
   for it is known that the prodigious empire which the pope claimed and
   had obtained over Christianity, was an emergency of the contests that
   fell out amongst the leaders of the greater sorts of churches about the
   rights, titles, and pre-eminencies among themselves, with some other
   occasional and intestine distempers. Only, he had one singular
   advantage for the promotion of his pretence and desire; for whereas
   this whole contignation of churches into all these storeys, in the top
   whereof he emerged and lifted up himself, was nothing but an
   accommodation of the church and its affairs unto the government of the
   Roman empire, or the setting up of an ecclesiastical image and
   representation of its secular power and rule, the centring therein of
   all subordinate powers and orders in one monarch inclined the minds of
   men to comply with his design as very reasonable. Hence, the principal
   plea for that power over the whole church which at present he claims
   lies in this, that the government of it ought to be monarchical. And
   therein consists a chief part of the mystery of this whole work, that
   whereas this fabric of church rule was erected in imitation of and
   compliance with the Roman empire, so that he could never effect his
   sovereignty whilst that empire stood in its strength and union, under
   the command of one or more emperors by consent, yet when that empire
   was destroyed, and the provinces thereof became parcelled out unto
   several nations, who erected absolute independent sovereignties among
   themselves, he was able, by the reputation he had before obtained, so
   to improve all emergencies and advantages as to gather all these new
   kingdoms into one religious empire under himself, by their common
   consent. In the meantime, by the original divisions of the empire, and
   the revolutions that happened afterward amongst the nations of the
   world, the greatest number of Christians were wholly unconcerned in
   this new church-sovereignty, which was erected in the western provinces
   of that empire. So was the mystery of iniquity consummated; for whereas
   the pope, to secure his new acquisitions, endeavoured to empale the
   title and privileges of the catholic church unto those Christians which
   professed obedience unto himself, unto an exclusion of a greater
   number, there ensued such a confusion of the catholic and a particular
   church, as that both of them were almost utterly lost.

   Concerning these several sorts of conceited particular churches, it is
   evident that some of them, as to their nature and kind, have no
   institution in or warrant from the Scripture, but were prudential
   contrivances of the men of the days wherein they were first formed;
   which they effected by various degrees, under the conduct of an
   apprehension that they tended unto the increase of concord and order
   among Christians. Whether really and effectually they have attained
   that end, the event hath long since manifested. And it will be one day
   acknowledged that no religious union or order among Christians will be
   lasting, and of spiritual use or advantage unto them, but what is
   appointed and designed for them by Jesus Christ. The truth is, the
   mutual intestine differences and contests among them who first
   possessed the rule of such churches, about their dignities,
   pre-eminencies, privileges, and jurisdictions, which first apparently
   let in pride, ambition, revenge, and hatred into the minds and lives of
   church guides, lost us the peace of Christendom; and the degeneracy of
   their successors more and more into a secular interest and worldly
   frame of spirit, is one great means of continuing us at a loss for its
   retrieval.

   How far any man may be obliged in conscience unto communion with these
   churches in those things wherein they are such, and as such behave
   themselves in all their rule and administrations, may be inquired into
   by them who are concerned. What respect we have unto them, or what duty
   we owe them, as they may in any place be established by the civil laws
   of the supreme magistrate, is not of our present consideration. But
   whereas, in their original and rise, they have no other warrant but the
   prudential contrivance of some men, who unquestionably might be
   variously influenced by corrupt prejudices and affections in the
   finding out and management of their inventions, what ground there is
   for holding a religious communion with them, and wherein such communion
   may consist, is not easy to be declared; for the notion that the
   church-communion of the generality of Christians and ministers consists
   only in a quiet subjection unto them who, by any means, may pretend to
   be set over them and claim a right to rule them, is fond and impious.
   In the meantime, we wholly deny that the mistakes or disorders of
   Christians in complying with or joining themselves unto such churches
   as have no warrantable institution ought to be any cause of the
   diminishing of our love towards them, or of withdrawing it from them:
   for, notwithstanding their errors and wanderings from the paths of
   truth in this matter, they do or may continue interested in all that
   love which is due from us unto the church of Christ upon the double
   account before insisted on; for they may be yet persons born of God,
   united unto Christ, made partakers of his Spirit, and so belong to the
   church catholic mystical, which is the first principal object of all
   Christian love and charity. The errors wherewith they are supposed to
   be overtaken may befall any persons under those qualifications, the
   admittance of them, though culpable, being not inconsistent with a
   state of grace and acceptation with God. And they may also, by a due
   profession of the fundamental truths of the gospel, evince themselves
   to be professed subjects of the visible kingdom of Christ in the world,
   and so belong to the church catholic visibly professing; under which
   notion the disciples of Christ are in the next place commended unto our
   love. And it is the fondest imagination in the world, that we must of
   necessity want love towards all those with whom we cannot join in all
   acts of religious worship, or that there need be any schism between
   them and us on the sole account thereof, taking schism in the common
   received notion of it. If we bear unkindness towards them in our minds
   and hearts; if we desire or seek their hurt; if we persecute them, or
   put them to trouble in the world for their profession; if we pray not
   for them; if we pity them not in all their temptations, errors, or
   sufferings; if we say unto any of them when naked, "Be thou clothed,"
   and when hungry, "Be thou fed," but relieve them not according unto our
   abilities and opportunities; if we have an aversion to their persons,
   or judge them any otherwise than as they cast themselves openly and
   visibly under the sentence of natural reason or Scripture rule, -- we
   may be justly thought to fail in our love towards them. But if our
   hearts condemn us not in these things, it is not the difference that is
   or may be between them and us about church-constitutions or order that
   ought to be a cause, or can be an evidence, of any want of love on our
   parts. There will, indeed, be a distinct and separate practice in the
   things wherein the difference lies; which in itself, and without other
   avoidable evils, need not on either side to be schismatical. If by
   censures, or any kind of power, such churches or persons would force us
   to submit unto or comply with such things or ways in religious worship
   as are contrary unto our light, and which they have no authority from
   the Lord Christ to impose upon us, the whole state of the case is
   changed, as we shall see afterward.

   As for those particular churches, which in any part of the world
   consist of persons assembling together for the worship of God in
   Christ, under the guidance of their own lawful pastors and teachers, we
   have only to say, that we are full well assured that "wherever two or
   three are gathered together in the name of Christ," there he is present
   with them; and farther than this, there are very few concerning whom we
   are called to pass any other censure or judgment. So we hope it is with
   them, and so we pray that it may be. And therefore we esteem it our
   duty to hold our communion with all these assemblies, when called
   thereunto; which is required of any Christians in the like cases and
   circumstances. Unless we are convinced that, with respect unto such or
   such instances, it is the mind of Christ that neither among ourselves,
   nor in conjunction with others, nor for the sake of the present
   communion with them, we should observe them in his worship, we judge
   ourselves under an obligation to make use of their assemblies in all
   acts of religion unto our edification, as occasion shall require. But
   where the authority of Christ in the things of sacred worship doth
   intervene, all other considerations must be discarded; and a compliance
   therewith will secure us from all irregular events.

   It must be acknowledged that many of these churches have woefully
   degenerated, and that any of them may so do, both from their primitive
   institution and also the sole role of their worship. And this they may
   do, and have done, in such various degrees and ways as necessarily
   requires a great variety in our judgments concerning them and our
   communion with them. The whole Christian world gives us instances
   hereof at this day; yea, we have it confirmed unto us in what is
   recorded concerning sundry churches mentioned in the Scripture itself.
   They were newly planted by the apostles themselves, and had rules given
   by them to attend unto for their direction; and, besides, they were
   obliged in all emergencies to inquire after and receive those commands
   and directions, which they were enabled infallibly to give unto them.
   And yet, notwithstanding these great advantages, we find that sundry of
   them were suddenly fallen into sinful neglects, disorders, and
   miscarriages, both in doctrine, discipline, and worship. Some of these
   were reproved and reformed by the great apostle, in his epistles
   written unto them for that end; and some of them were rebuked and
   threatened by the Lord Christ himself immediately from heaven, Rev.
   ii., iii. That in process of time they have increased in their
   degeneracy, waxing worse and worse, their present state and condition
   in the world, or the remembrance of them which are now not at all, with
   the severe dealings of God with them in his holy, wise providence, do
   sufficiently manifest. Yea, some of them, though yet continuing under
   other forms and shapes, have, by their superstition, false worship, and
   express idolatry, joined with wickedness of life and persecution of the
   true worshippers of Christ, as also by casting themselves into a new
   worldly constitution, utterly foreign unto what is appointed in the
   gospel, abandoned their interest in the state and rights of the
   churches of Christ. So are sundry faithful cities become harlots; and
   where righteousness inhabited, there dwell persecuting murderers. Such
   churches were planted of Christ wholly noble vines, but are degenerated
   into those that are bitter and wild. Whatever our judgment may be
   concerning the personal condition of the members of such apostatized
   churches, or any of them, all communion with them, as they would be
   esteemed the seat of gospel ordinances, and in their pretended
   administration of them, is unlawful for us, and it is our indispensable
   duty to separate from them: for whatever indifference many may be
   growing into in matter of outward worship, -- which ariseth from
   ignorance of the respect that is between the grace and institutions of
   Christ, as that from an apprehension that all internal religion
   consists in moral honesty only, -- yet we know not any other way
   whereby we may approve ourselves faithful in our profession but in the
   observance of all whatever Christ hath commanded, Matt. xxviii. 20, and
   to abstain from what he condemns; for both our faith and love, whatever
   we pretend, will be found vain if we endeavour not to keep his
   commandments, John xv. 10, 14.

   Such was the state of things in the church of Israel of old, after the
   defection under Jeroboam. It was no more a true church, nor any church
   at all, by virtue of positive institution; for they had neither
   priests, nor sacrifices, nor any ordinances of public worship, that God
   approved of. Hence it was the duty of all that feared God in the ten
   tribes not to join with the leaders and body of the people in their
   worship; as also to observe those sacred institutions of the law which
   were forbidden by them, in the order that they should not go up to
   Jerusalem, but attend unto all their sacred solemnities in the places
   where the calves were set up, 1 Kings xii., xiii.; 2 Chron. xi., xiii.
   Accordingly, many of the most zealous professors among them, with the
   priests and Levites, and with a great multitude of the people, openly
   separated from the rest, and joined themselves unto Judah in the
   worship of God continued therein. Others amongst them secretly, in the
   worst of times, preserved themselves from the abominations of the whole
   people. In like manner under the New Testament, when some have deserved
   the title of "Babylon," because of their idolatry, false worship, and
   persecution, we are commanded to "come out from among them," in an
   open, visible, professed separation, that we be not partakers of their
   sins and plagues. But this judgment we are not to make, nor do make
   concerning any, but such as among whom idolatry spreads itself over the
   face of all their solemn assemblies, and who join thereunto the
   persecution of them who desire to worship God in spirit and in truth.
   The constitution of such churches, as to their being acceptable
   assemblies of worshippers before God, is lost and dissolved; neither is
   it lawful for any disciple of Christ to partake with them in their
   sacred administrations, for so to do is plainly to disown the authority
   of Christ, or to set up that of wicked and corrupt men above it.

   Yet all this hinders not but that there may in such apostatical
   churches remain a profession of the fundamental truths of the gospel.
   And by virtue thereof, as they maintain the interest of Christ's
   visible kingdom in the world, so we no way doubt but that there may be
   many amongst them who, by a saving faith in the truths they do profess,
   do really belong to the mystical church of Christ.

   An instituted church, therefore, may, by the crimes and wickedness of
   its rulers and the generality of its members, and their idolatrous
   administrations in holy things, utterly destroy their instituted
   estate, and yet not presently all of them cease to belong unto the
   kingdom of Christ: for we cannot say that those things which will
   certainly annul church administrations, and render them abominable,
   will absolutely destroy the salvation of all individual persons who
   partake in them; and many may secretly preserve themselves from being
   defiled with such abominations. So in the height of the degeneracy and
   apostasy of the Israelitish church, there were seven thousand who kept
   themselves pure from Baalish idolatry, of whom none were known to
   Elijah. And therefore did God still continue a respect unto them as his
   people, because of those secret ones, and because the token of his
   covenant was yet in their flesh, affording unto them an extraordinary
   ministry by his prophets, when the ordinary by priests and Levites was
   utterly ceased. This we are to hope concerning every place where there
   is any profession made of the name of Christ, seeing it was the passion
   of Elijah which caused him to oversee so great a remnant as God had
   left unto himself in the kingdom of Israel. And from his example we may
   learn, that good men may sometimes be more severe in their censures for
   God than he will be for himself.

   Moreover, such as were baptized in those churches were not baptized
   into them as particular churches, nor initiated into them thereby; but
   the relation which ensued unto them thereon was unto the catholic
   church visible, together with a separation from the infidel world,
   lying wholly in darkness and evil, by a dedication unto the name of
   Christ. Upon a personal avowment of that faith whereinto they were
   baptized, they became complete members of that church. Whatever state
   they are hereby admitted into, whatever benefit or privilege they are
   personally interested in, they lose them not by the miscarriage of that
   particular church whereunto they do relate; yea, losing the whole
   advantage of an instituted church-state, they may still retain whatever
   belongs unto their faith and profession. Were baptism only an
   institution into a particular church, upon the failure of that church,
   baptism, as to all its benefits and privileges, must cease also. We do
   therefore own, that amongst those whose assemblies are rejected by
   Christ, because of their false worship and wickedness, there may be
   persons truly belonging to the mystical church of God, and that also by
   their profession are a portion of his visible kingdom in the world. How
   far they do consent unto the abominations of the churches whereunto
   they do belong, how far they have light against them, how far they do
   bewail them, how far they repent of them, what God will bear withal in
   them, we know not, nor are called to judge. Our love is to be towards
   them as persons relating unto Jesus Christ in the capacity mentioned;
   but all communion with them in the acts of false worship is forbidden
   unto us. By virtue also of that relation in which they still continue
   unto Christ and his church, as believers, they have power, and are
   warranted (as it is their duty), to reform themselves, and to join
   together anew in church order, for the due celebration of gospel
   ordinances, unto the glory of Christ and their own edification; for it
   is fond to imagine, that by the sins of others any disciples of Christ,
   in any place of the world, should be deprived of a right to perform
   their duty towards him, when it is discovered unto them. And these are
   our thoughts concerning such churches as are openly and visibly
   apostatical.

   Again, there are corruptions that may befall or enter into churches,
   that are not of so heinous a nature as those before insisted on,
   especially if, as it often falls out, the whole lump be not leavened;
   if the whole body be not infected, but only some part or parts of it,
   which others more sound do resist and give their testimony against. And
   these may have none of the pernicious consequences before mentioned.
   Thus, many errors in doctrines, disorders and miscarriages in sacred
   administrations, irregular walking in conversation, with neglect or
   abuse of discipline in rulers, may fall out in some churches, which yet
   may be so far from evacuating their church state, as that they give no
   sufficient warrant unto any person immediately to leave their communion
   or to separate from them. The instances that may be given of the
   failings of some of the primitive churches in all these things, with
   the consideration of the apostolical directions given unto them on such
   occasions, render this assertion evident and uncontrollable. Nor do we
   in the least approve of their practice (if any such there be that are
   considerable), who, upon every failing in these things in any church,
   think themselves sufficiently warranted immediately of their own minds
   to depart from its communion. Much more do we condemn them who suffer
   themselves in these things to be guided by their own surmises and
   misapprehensions; for such there may be as make their own hasty
   conceptions to be the rule of all church administrations and communion,
   -- who, unless they are in all things pleased, can be quiet nowhere.
   Wherefore, when any church, whereof a man is by his own consent
   antecedently a member, doth fall, in part or in whole, from any of
   those truths which it hath professed, or when it is overtaken with a
   neglect of discipline or irregularities in its administration, such a
   one is to consider that he is placed in his present state by divine
   Providence, that he may orderly therein endeavour to put a stop unto
   such defections, and to exercise his charity, love, and forbearance
   towards the persons of them whose miscarriages at present he cannot
   remedy. In such cases there is a large and spacious field for wisdom,
   patience, love, and prudent zeal to exercise themselves. And it is a
   most perverse imagination, that separation is the only cure for church
   disorders. All the gifts and graces of the Spirit bestowed on church
   members, to be exercised in their several stations at such a season, --
   all instructions given for their due improvement unto the good of the
   whole, -- the nature, rules, and laws of all societies, -- declare that
   all other remedies possible and lawful are to be attempted before a
   church be finally deserted. But these rules are to be observed provided
   always that it be judged unlawful, for any persons, either, for the
   sake of peace, or order, or concord, or on any other consideration, to
   join actually in anything that is sinful, or to profess any opinion
   which is contrary to sound doctrine or the form of wholesome words,
   which we are bound to hold fast on all emergencies. And farther: if we
   may suppose, as sure enough we may, that such a church, so corrupted,
   shall obstinately persist in its errors, miscarriages, neglects, and
   maladministrations; that it shall refuse to be warned or admonished, or
   being so, by any means, shall willfully reject and despise all
   instruction; that it will not bear with them that are yet sound in it,
   whether elders or members, in peaceable endeavours to reduce it unto
   the order of the gospel, but shall rather hurt, persecute, and seek
   their trouble for so doing, whereby their edification comes continually
   to be obstructed, and their souls to be hazarded, through the loss of
   truth and peace; -- we no way doubt but that it is lawful for such
   persons to withdraw themselves from the communion of such churches, and
   that without any apprehension that they have absolutely lost their
   church-state, or are totally rejected by Jesus Christ; for the means
   appointed unto any end are to be measured and regulated according unto
   their usefulness unto that end. And let men's present apprehensions be
   what they will, it will one day appear that the end of all church
   order, rule, communion, and administrations, is, not the grandeur or
   secular advantage of some few, not outward peace and quietness, unto
   whose preservation the civil power is ordained; but the edification of
   the souls of men, in faith, love, and gospel obedience. Where,
   therefore, these things are so disposed of and managed as that they do
   not regularly further and promote that end, but rather obstruct it, if
   they will not be reduced unto their due order and tendency, they may be
   laid aside and made use of in another way. Much more may any refuse the
   communion of such churches, if they impose on them their corruptions,
   errors, failings, and mistakes, as the condition of their communion;
   for hereby they directly make themselves lords over the faith and
   worship of the disciples of Christ, and are void of all authority from
   him in what they so do or impose. And it is so far [from being true],
   that any men's withdrawing of themselves from the communion of such
   churches, and entering into a way of reformation for their own good, in
   obedience to the laws of Christ, should infer in them a want of love
   and peaceableness, or a spirit of division, that to do otherwise were
   to divide from Christ, and to cast out all true Christian love,
   embracing a cloud of slothful negligence and carelessness in the great
   concernments of the glory of God and their own souls in the room
   thereof. We are neither the authors nor the guides of our own love: he
   who implants and worketh it in us hath given us rules how it must be
   exercised, and that on all emergencies. It may work as regularly by
   sharp cutting rebukes as by the most silken and compliant expressions,
   -- by manifesting an aversation from all that is evil, as by embracing
   and approving of what is good. In all things and cases it is to be
   directed by the word. And when, under the pretence of it, we leave that
   rule, and go off from any duty which we owe immediately unto God, it is
   will, pride, and self-conceit in us, and not love. And among all the
   exhortations that are given us in the Scripture unto unity and concord,
   as the fruits of love, there is not one that we should agree or comply
   with any in their sins or evil practices. But as we are commanded in
   ourselves to abstain "from all appearance of evil," so are we forbidden
   a participation in the sins of other men, and all "fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness." Our love towards such churches is to
   work by pity, compassion, prayer, instructions; which are due means for
   their healing and recovery; -- not by consent unto them or communion
   with them, whereby they may be hardened in the error of their way, and
   our own souls be subverted: for if we have not a due respect unto the
   Lord Christ and his authority, all that we have, or may pretend to
   have, unto any church is of no value; neither ought we to take into
   consideration any terms of communion whose foundation is not laid in a
   regard thereunto.

   Moreover (as hath been declared), there is no such society of
   Christians in the world, whose assemblies, as to instituted worship,
   are rejected by Christ so that they have a bill of divorce given unto
   them, by the declaration of the will of the Lord Jesus to that purpose
   in the Scripture, but that, until they are utterly also, as it were,
   extirpate by the providence of God (as are many of the primitive
   plantations), we are persuaded of them that there are yet some secret,
   hidden ones among them, that belong unto the purpose of God's grace;
   for we do judge that wherever the name of Jesus Christ is called upon,
   there is salvation to be obtained, however the ways of it may be
   obstructed unto the most by their own sins and errors. They may also
   retain that profession which distinguisheth them from the infidel
   world. In these things we are still to hold communion with them, and on
   these accounts is our love to be continued unto them. Some kind of
   communion we may hold with them that are of no instituted or particular
   churches, or whose church-state is rejected, even as a person
   excommunicated is to be admonished as a brother. And some kind of
   communion we may lawfully refuse with some true churches; instances
   whereof shall be given afterward.

   There is, therefore, no necessity that any should deny all them to be
   true churches from whom they may have just reason to withdraw their
   communion; for such as are so may require such things thereunto as it
   is not lawful for them to accept of or submit unto. What assemblies of
   Christians we behold visibly worshipping God in Christ, we take for
   granted to be true visible churches. And when we judge of our own
   communion with them, it is not upon this question, whether they are
   true churches or no, as though the determination of our practice did
   depend solely thereon: for as we are not called to judge of the being
   of their constitution, as to the substance of it, unless they are
   openly judged in the Scripture, as in the case of idolatry and
   persecution persisted in; so a determination of the truth of their
   constitution, or that they are true churches, will not presently
   resolve us in our duty as to communion with them, for the reasons
   before given. But in such a case two things are by us principally to be
   considered:-- 1. That nothing sinful in itself, or unto us, be required
   of us as the condition of communion. 2. That we may in such churches
   obtain the immediate end of their institution and our conjunction with
   them; which is our edification in faith, love, and obedience.

   And the things whereof we have discoursed comprise our thoughts
   concerning those societies of Christians whose degeneracy from their
   primitive rule and institution is most manifest and notorious. Whilst
   there is any profession of the gospel, any subjection of souls unto
   Jesus Christ avowed, or any expectation of help from him continued
   among them, we cannot but hope that there are, in all of them, at least
   some few names that are "written in the Lamb's book of life," and which
   shall be saved eternally: for as a relation unto a particular visible
   church, walking according to the order and rule of the gospel, is the
   duty of every believer to give himself up unto, as that which is a
   means appointed and sanctified to the furtherance of his edification
   and salvation; so where it cannot be obtained, through invincible
   outward impediments, or is omitted through ignorance of duty, or is on
   just causes refused where opportunities make a tender of it, or where
   the being and benefit of it are lost through the apostasy of those
   churches whereunto any persons did belong, the utter want of it, and
   that always, is not such as necessarily infers the eternal loss of
   their souls who suffer under it.

   Other churches there are in the world, which are not evidently guilty
   of the enormities, in doctrine, worship, and discipline, before
   discoursed of. These all we judge to be true churches of Christ, and do
   hope that his promised presence is with them in their assemblies.
   Answerable hereunto is our judgment concerning their officers or
   rulers, and all their sacred administrations. It becomes us to think
   and believe that the one have authority from Christ, and that the other
   are accepted with him; for it is most unwarrantable rashness and
   presumption, yea, an evident fruit of ignorance, or want of love, or
   secular, private interest, when upon lesser differences men judge
   churches to be no true churches, and their ministers to be no true
   ministers, and, consequently, all their administrations to be invalid.
   So do some judge of churches, because they have bishops; and so do more
   of others because they have none. But the validity or invalidity of the
   ordinances of Christ, which are the means of union and communion with
   him unto all his disciples, depend not on the determination of things
   highly disputable in their notion, and not inconsistent with true
   gospel obedience in their practice. And we are unduly charged with
   other apprehensions. God forbid that any such thought should ever enter
   into our hearts, as though the churches constituted in all things
   according unto our light, and the rules we apprehend appointed in the
   Scripture for that purpose, should be the only true churches in the
   world. They do but out of design endeavour to expose us to popular envy
   and hatred who invent and publish such things concerning us, or any of
   us. But whatever be the judgment of others concerning us, we intend not
   to take from thence any such provocation as might corrupt our judgments
   concerning them, nor to relieve ourselves by returning the like
   censures unto them as we receive from them. Scripture rule and duty
   must in these matters regulate our thoughts on all occasions. And
   whilst we judge others to be true churches, we shall not be much moved
   with their judgment that we are none, because we differ from them. We
   stand to the judgment of Christ and his word. We cannot but judge,
   indeed, that many churches have missed, and do miss, in some things,
   the precise rules of their due constitution and walking; that many of
   them have added useless, superfluous rites to the worship of God among
   them; that there is in many of them a sinful neglect of evangelical
   discipline, or a carnal rule erected in the stead of it; that errors in
   doctrines of importance and danger are prevalent in sundry of them;
   that their rulers are much influenced by a spirit of bitterness and
   envy against such as plead for reformation beyond their measure or
   interest; -- yet that hereupon they should all or any of them
   immediately forfeit their church-state, so as to have no lawful
   ministers nor acceptable sacred administrations, is in itself false
   imagination, and such as was never by us entertained.

   In particular, as to those churches in Europe which are commonly called
   Reformed, we have the same thoughts of them, the same love towards
   them, the same readiness for communion with them, as we would desire
   any disciples of Christ in the world to have, bear, or exercise towards
   ourselves. If we are found negligent in any office of love towards them
   or any of their members, -- in compassion, help, or assistance, or such
   supplies in outward or inward things as we have opportunity or ability
   for, -- we are willing to bear the guilt of it as our sin, an the
   reproach of it as our shame. And herein we desire to fulfil the royal
   law, according to the Scripture, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself." The same we say concerning all the churches in England of the
   same mould and constitution with them; especially if it be true, which
   some say, that parochial churches are under a force and power, whereby
   they are enjoined the practice of sundry things and forbidden the
   performance of others, wherein the compliance of some is not
   over-voluntary nor pleasing to themselves. Neither is there a nullity
   or invalidity in the ordinances administered in them, any otherwise
   than as some render them ineffectual unto themselves by their unbelief.
   And this is the paganizing of England which some of us are traduced
   for! We believe that, among the visible professors in this nation,
   there is as great a number of sincere believers as in any nation under
   heaven; so that in it are treasured up a considerable portion of the
   invisible mystical church of Christ. We believe that the generality of
   the inhabitants of this nation are, by their profession, constituted an
   eminent part of the kingdom of Christ in this world. And we judge not,
   we condemn not, those who, walking according to their light and
   understanding in particular rites, do practice such things in the
   worship of God as we cannot comply withal; for we do not think that the
   things wherein they fail, wherein they miss or outgo the rule, are in
   their own nature absolutely destructive of their particular
   church-state. And what more can reasonably be required of us, or
   expected from us, in this matter, we know not. The causes of the
   distance that doth remain between us all shall be afterward inquired
   into. For our duty in particular presential communion, at the
   celebration of the same individual ordinances, with such churches as
   are remote from us, in Asia or Africa, we shall, we hope, be directed
   to determine aright concerning it when we are called thereunto. In the
   meantime, what are our thoughts concerning them hath been before
   declared: to love them as subjects of the kingdom of Jesus Christ in
   the world, to pray for them that they have all needful supplies of
   grace and the Holy Spirit from above, that God would send out his light
   and truth to guide them in their worship and obedience, and to help
   them in things spiritual and temporal, as we have opportunity, is the
   sum of the duty which is required in us towards them. Those we are more
   concerned in who are within the lines of our ordinary communication,
   among whom we walk and converse in the world. Unto any of these it is
   in the liberty and power of every believer to join himself, by his own
   consent. And no more is required hereunto, in the present constitution
   of churches among ourselves, but that a man remove his habitation, to
   comply with his own desires herein: and this choice is to be regulated
   by a judgment how a man may best improve and promote his own
   edification. We see not, therefore, how any man, with the least
   pretence of sobriety or modesty, can charge us with the want of an
   esteem and valuation of evangelical unity; for we embrace it on all the
   grounds that it is in the gospel recommended unto us. And we do know
   within what narrow bounds the charity and unity of some are confined,
   who yet advantage themselves by a noise of their pretence. But that we
   do not in the least disturb, break, or dissent from the catholic
   church, either as it is invisible, in its internal form, by faith and
   the renovation of the Holy Ghost, or as visibly professing necessary,
   fundamental truths of the gospel, we have sufficiently evinced. And the
   principles laid down concerning particular churches, congregations,
   assemblies, or parishes, have not as yet been detected by any to spring
   from want of love, or to be obstructive of the exercise of it. Having,
   therefore, thus briefly given some account of what we conceive to be
   our duty in relation unto the whole church of God, we can with
   confidence and much assurance of mind own as dear a valuation of love,
   unity, and peaceableness in the profession of the gospel as any sort of
   professors whatever. And we are persuaded that our principles do as
   much tend and conduce unto the improvement of them as any that are or
   can be proposed unto that end; for we either do or are in a readiness
   to embrace every thing or way that the Lord Christ hath appointed or
   doth bless thereunto.

   We doubt not, as hath been before acknowledged, but that there have
   been many failings and sinful miscarriages among all sorts of
   professors, who separate, or are rather driven from, the present public
   worship. There is no question but that in them all there are some
   remainders of the bitter root of corrupt affections, which, under the
   various temptations and provocations they have been exposed unto, hath
   brought forth fruit of an unpleasant relish. It is no new thing that
   irregular prejudices should be found acting themselves in professors of
   the gospel; it hath been so among them from the beginning. And we hope
   that, where there is or hath been any guilt of this nature, the
   reproofs which have been publicly given unto it (with what spirit or
   intention soever managed) may be useful to the amendment of them who
   have offended. But for our own parts, we must bear this testimony, unto
   our sincerity, that we not only condemn but abhor all evil surmises
   among professors, all rash and uncharitable censures, all causeless
   aversations of mind and affections, all strife, wrath, anger, and
   debate, upon the account of different apprehensions and practices in
   and about the concerns of religious worship. Much more do we cast out
   all thoughts of judging men's eternal state and condition with respect
   unto such differences; nor do we, nor dare we, give countenance unto
   any thing that is in the least really opposite to love, peace, unity,
   or concord, amongst the disciples of Christ. And as we shall not excuse
   any of those extravagancies and intemperate heats, in words or
   otherwise, which some it may be have been guilty of, who, until their
   repentance, must bear their own judgment; so we will not make a
   recharge on others who differ in persuasion from us of the same or the
   like crimes; nor indeed need we so to do, their principles and
   practices, contrary unto all Christian love and charity, being written
   as with the beams of the sun. And we do not complain of our lot in the
   world, -- that the appearance of such things in any of us would be
   esteemed a scandalous crime, which others that condemn them in us
   indulge in themselves without the least check or control. The law of
   this condition is put upon us by the profession which we do avow. Only,
   we are not willing that any should make advantage against us by their
   pleas for love, unity, and concord; as if, indeed, they were for peace,
   but that we make ourselves ready for war. Could they convince us that
   we come behind them in the valuation and seeking after these things by
   all ways and means blessed by Christ to that purpose, we should judge
   ourselves with a severity at least commensurate to the utmost they are
   able to exercise against us, whilst free from malice and evil designs.
   Only we must add, that there is no true measure of love to be taken by
   the accessions that men can make towards them who depart from truth. If
   it were so, those must be judged to abound most with it who can most
   comply with the practices of the church of Rome. But we are persuaded
   that such discourses, with the application of them unto those who
   differ from their authors, do proceed from sincerity in them; only, as
   we fear, somewhat leavened with an apprehension that their judgments
   and practices, being according unto truth, ought to be the standard and
   measure of other men's, perhaps no less sincere and confident of the
   truth than themselves, though differing from them. And hence it is
   unhappily fallen out, that, in the reproofs which some do manage on the
   foundations mentioned, and in the way of their management, many do
   suppose that there is as great an appearance, if not evidence, of evil
   surmises, ungrounded, temerarious censures; of self-conceit and elation
   of mind; of hard thoughts of, undue charges on, and the contempt of
   others; and in all of a want of real love, condescension, and
   compassion, as in any things that are true and to be really found among
   professors blamed by them: for these things, both as charged and
   recharged, have a double appearance. Those from whom they proceed look
   on them in the light of that sincerity and integrity which they are
   conscious of to themselves, wherein they seem amiable, useful, and free
   from all offence; whereas others, that are concerned, viewing of them
   in the disordered reflections of their opposition unto them, and the
   disadvantage which they undergo by them, do apprehend them quite of
   another nature. And it is a matter of trouble unto us to find that when
   some are severely handled for those principles and ways wherein they
   can and do commend their consciences unto God, -- and thereby
   apprehending that their intentions, purposes, principles, and
   affections, are injuriously traduced and perverted, -- they fall with
   an equal severity on them by whom they are reproved; though their
   reproofs proceed from an equal sincerity unto what themselves profess
   and expect to be believed in. Especially are such mutual reflections
   grievous and irksome unto men, when they apprehend that in them or by
   them professed friends do industriously expose them to the contempt and
   wrath of professed adversaries.

Chapter IV.

   Want of love and unity among Christians justly complained of -- Causes
   of divisions and schisms -- 1. Misapprehensions of evangelical unity --
   Wherein it doth truly consist -- The ways and means whereby it may be
   obtained and preserved -- Mistakes about both -- 2. Neglect in churches
   to attend unto known gospel duty -- Of preaching unto conversion and
   edification -- Care of those that are really godly -- Of discipline:
   how neglected, how corrupted -- Principles seducing churches and their
   rulers into miscarriages: 1. Confidence of their place; 2. Contempt of
   the people; 3. Trust unto worldly grandeur -- Other causes of divisions
   -- Remainders of corruption from the general apostasy -- Weakness and
   ignorance -- Of readiness to take offence -- Remedies hereof -- Pride
   -- False teachers.

   Upon the whole matter, it is generally acknowledged that there is a
   great decay of love, a great want of peace and unity, among professors
   of the gospel in the world. And it is no less evident nor less
   acknowledged that these things are frequently commanded and enjoined
   unto them in the Scripture. Might they be obtained, it would greatly
   further the ends of the gospel and answer the mind of Christ; and their
   loss is obstructive unto the one, and no less dishonourable unto that
   profession which is made of the name of the other: for the divisions of
   Christians (occasioned chiefly by false notions of unity, and undue
   means of attaining it) are the chief cause of offences unto them who
   are yet strangers from Christianity. The Jews object unto us the wars
   among Christians, which they suppose shall have no place under the
   kingdom and reign of the true Messiah. And we have been reproached with
   our intestine differences by Gentiles and Mohammedans; for those who
   never had either peace, or love, or unity among themselves, do yet
   think meet to revile us with the want of them, because they know how
   highly we are obliged unto them. But any men may be justly charged with
   the neglect of that duty which they profess, if they be found defective
   therein. Under the sad effects of the want of these things we may
   labour long enough, if we endeavour not to take away the causes of it.
   And yet in the entrance of our disquisition after them we are again
   entangled. Christians cannot come to an agreement about these causes;
   and so live under the severity of their effects, as not being able to
   conclude on a remedy. The multitude of them is here divided, and one
   crieth one thing, another another. Most place the cause of all our
   differences in a dissent from themselves and their judgments; yea, they
   do so apparently who yet disavow their so doing. And it may be here
   expected that we should give some account of our thoughts as to the
   causes of these differences, whereof we also have now complained, so
   far as they are contrary to the nature or obstructive of the ends of
   the gospel. We shall therefore briefly endeavour the satisfaction of
   such as may have those expectations. Particular evils, which contribute
   much unto our divisions, we shall not insist upon; much less shall we
   reflect upon and aggravate the failings of others, whether persons or
   societies. Some of the principal and more general reasons and causes of
   them, especially amongst Protestants, it shall suffice us to enumerate.

   1. The principal cause of our divisions and schisms is no other than
   the ignorance or misapprehension that is among Christians of the true
   nature of that evangelical unity which they ought to follow after, with
   the ways and means whereby it may be attained and preserved. Hence it
   is come to pass, that, in the greatest pleas for unity and endeavours
   after it, most men have pursued a shadow, and fought uncertainly, as
   those that beat the air; for having lost every notion of gospel unity,
   and not loving the thing itself, under what terms soever proposed unto
   them, they consigned the name of it unto, and clothed with its
   ornaments and privileges, a vain figment of their own, which the Lord
   Christ never required, nor ever blessed any in their endeavours to
   attain. And when they had changed the end, it was needful for them also
   to change the means of attaining it, and to substitute those in their
   room which were suited to the new mark and aim they had erected.
   Farther to evidence these things, we shall give some account of the
   nature of evangelical unity, the means of attaining it, with the false
   notion of it that some have embraced, and the corrupt means which they
   have used for the compassing of the same.

   First, That unity which is recommended unto us in the gospel is
   spiritual; and in that which is purely so lies the foundation of the
   whole. Hence it is called "The unity of the Spirit," which is to be
   kept "in the bond of peace;" because "there is one body, and one
   Spirit," whereby that body is animated, Eph. iv. 3, 4. Thus, all true
   believers become one in the Father and the Son, or perfect in one, John
   xvii. 21, 22. It is their participation of, and quickening by, the same
   Spirit that is in Christ Jesus, whereby they become his body, or
   members of it, "even of his flesh and of his bones," Eph. v. 30; that
   is, no less really partakers of the same divine spiritual nature with
   him, 2 Pet. i. 4, than Eve was of the nature of Adam, when she was made
   of his flesh and his bones, Gen. ii. 23. The real union of all true
   believers unto the Lord Christ as their head, wrought by his Spirit,
   which dwelleth in them, and communicates of his grace unto them, is
   that which we intend; for as hereby they become one with and in him, so
   they come to be one among themselves, as his body; and all the members
   of the body, being many, are yet but one body, wherein their oneness
   among themselves doth consist. The members of the body have divers
   forms or shapes, divers uses and operations, much more may be diversely
   clothed and adorned; yet are they one body still, wherein their unity
   doth consist. And it were a ridiculous thing to attempt the appearance
   of a dead, useless unity among the members of the body, by clothing of
   them all in the same kind of garments or covering. But granting them
   their unity by their relation unto the Head, and thence to one another,
   unto the constitution of the whole, and their different forms, shapes,
   uses, operations, ornaments, all tend to make them serviceable in their
   unity unto their proper ends. And saith the apostle, "As the body is
   one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being
   many, are one body; so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all
   baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be
   bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit," 1 Cor.
   xii. 12, 13. And he doth elsewhere so describe this fundamental unity
   of believers in one body, under and in dependence on the same Head, as
   to make it the only means of the usefulness and preservation of the
   whole. They "grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even
   Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by
   that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in
   the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the
   edifying of itself in love," Eph. iv. 15, 16. The conjunctions of all
   the members into one body, their mutual usefulness unto one another,
   the edification of the whole, with its increase, the due exercise of
   love (which things contain the whole nature and the utmost ends of all
   church-communion), do depend merely and solely upon, and flow from, the
   relation that the members have to the Head, and their union with him.
   He speaketh again to the same purpose in the reproof of them who "hold
   not the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having
   nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase
   of God," Col. ii. 19. This is the foundation of all gospel unity among
   believers, whereunto all other things which are required unto the
   completing of it are but accessory; nor are they, without this, of any
   value or acceptation in the sight of God. Whatever order, peace,
   concord, union in the church, any one may hold or keep who is not
   interested herein, he is but like a stone in a building, laid it may be
   in a comely order, but not cemented and fixed unto the whole; which
   renders its station useless to the building and unsafe unto itself: or
   like a dead, mortified part of the body, which neither receives any
   vital influence from the head, nor administers nourishment unto any
   other part. Now, it cannot be denied but that, in the contests that are
   in the world about church union and divisions, with what is pleaded
   about their nature and causes, there is little or no consideration had
   thereof. Yea, those things are principally insisted on, for the
   constituting of the one and the avoiding of the other, which casts a
   neglect, yea, a contempt upon it. It is the Romanists who make the
   greatest outcries about church-union, and who make the greatest
   advantage by what they pretend so to be. But hereunto they contend
   expressly, on the one side, that it is indispensably necessary that all
   Christians should be subject to the pope of Rome and united unto him;
   and, on the other, that it is not necessary at all that any of them be
   spiritually and savingly united unto Christ. Others, also, place it in
   various instances of conformity unto and compliance with the commands
   of men; which, if they are observed, they are wondrous cold in their
   inquiries after this relation unto the Head. But the truth is, that
   where any one is interested in this foundation of all gospel unity, he
   may demand communion with any church in the world, and ought not to be
   refused, unless in case of some present offence or scandal. And those
   by whom such persons are rejected from communion, to be held on gospel
   terms, on the account of some differences not intrenching on this
   foundation, do exercise a kind of church tyranny, and are guilty of the
   schism which may ensue thereon. So, on the other side, where this is
   wanting, men's compliance with any other terms or conditions that may
   be proposed unto them, and their obtaining of church-communion thereon,
   will be of little advantage unto their souls.

   Secondly, Unto this foundation of gospel unity among believers, for and
   unto the due improvement of it, there is required a unity of faith, or
   of the belief and profession of the same divine truth; for as there is
   one Lord, so also [there is] one faith and one baptism unto believers.
   And this ariseth from and followeth the other; for those who are so
   united unto Christ are all taught of God to believe the truths which
   are necessarily required thereunto. And however, by the power of
   temptation, they may fall in it or from it for a season, as did Peter,
   yet, through the love and care of Jesus Christ, they are again
   recovered. Now, unto this unity of faith two things are required: --
   First, A precise and express profession of the fundamental articles of
   Christian religion; for we outwardly hold the Head by a consent unto
   the form of wholesome words wherein the doctrine of it is contained. Of
   the number and nature of such fundamental truths, whose express
   acknowledgment belongs unto the unity of faith, so much has been
   discoursed by others as that we need not add any thing thereunto. The
   sum is, that they are but few, plainly delivered in the Scripture,
   evidencing their own necessity, all conducing to the begetting and
   increase of that spiritual life whereby we live unto God. Secondly, It
   is required hereunto, that in other things and duties "every man be
   fully persuaded in his own mind," and, walking according to what he
   hath attained, do follow peace and love with those who are otherwise
   persuaded than he is, Rom. xiv. 5; Phil. iii. 16; -- for the unity of
   faith did never consist in the same precise conceptions of all revealed
   objects; neither the nature of man nor the means of revelation will
   allow such a unity to be morally possible. And the figment of supplying
   this variety by an implicit faith is ridiculous; for herein faith is
   considered as professed, and no man can make profession of what he
   knoweth not. It is, therefore, condescension and mutual forbearance
   whereby the unity of faith, consisting in the joint belief of necessary
   truths, is to be preserved with respect unto other things about which
   differences may arise.

   Yet is not this so to be understood as though Christians, especially
   ministers of the gospel, should content themselves with the knowledge
   of such fundamentals, or confine their Scripture inquiries unto them.
   Whatever is written in the Scripture is "written for our admonition, 1
   Cor. x. 11; and it is our duty to search diligently into the whole
   counsel of God, therein revealed; yea, to inquire with "all diligence,"
   1 Tim. iv. 13-16; 2 Tim. iii. 15-17; 1 Pet. i. 10, 11, in the use of
   all means and the improvement of all advantages, with fervent
   supplications for light and aid from above, into the whole mystery of
   the will of God, as revealed in the Scripture, and all the parts of it,
   is the principal duty that is incumbent on us in this world. And those
   who take upon them to be ministers and instructers of others, by whom
   this is neglected, who take up with a superficiary knowledge of general
   principles, and those such, for the most part, as have a coincidence
   with the light of nature, do but betray the souls of those over whom
   they usurp a charge, and are unworthy of the title and office which
   they bear. Neither is there any thing implied in the means of
   preserving the unity of faith that should hinder us from explaining,
   confirming, and vindicating any truth that we have received, wherein
   others differ from us, provided that what we do be done with a spirit
   of meekness and love; yea, our so doing is one principal means of
   ministering nourishment unto the body, whereby the whole is increased
   as "with the increase of God."

   But in the room of all this, what contendings, fightings, destructions
   of men, body and soul, upon variety of judgments about sacred things,
   have been introduced, by the craft of Satan and the carnal interest of
   men of corrupt minds, is known to all the world.

   Thirdly, There is a unity of love that belongs unto the evangelical
   unity which we are in the description of; for love is the bond of
   perfection, that whereby all the members of the body of Christ are knit
   together among themselves, and which renders all the other ingredients
   of this unity useful unto them. And as we have discoursed of the nature
   of this love before, so the exercise of it, as it hath an actual
   influence into gospel unity among Christians, may be reduced unto two
   heads. For, first, It worketh effectually, according to the measure of
   them in whom it is, in the contribution of supplies of grace, and
   light, and helps of obedience, unto other members of the body. Every
   one in whom this love dwelleth, according to his ability, call, and
   opportunities, which make up his measure, will communicate the
   spiritual supplies which he receiveth from the head, Christ Jesus, unto
   others, by instructions, exhortations, consolations, and example, unto
   their edification. This he will do in love, and unto the ends of love,
   -- namely, to testify a joint relation unto Christ, the head of all,
   and the increase of the whole by supplies of life from him. Instead
   hereof, some have invented bonds of ecclesiastical unity, which may
   bind men together in some appearance of order, whilst in the meantime
   they live in envy, wrath, and malice, biting and devouring one another;
   or if there be any thing of love among them, it is that which is merely
   natural, or carnal and sensual, working by a joint consent in delights
   and pleasure, or at best in civil things, belonging unto their
   conversation in this world. The love that is among such persons in this
   world is of the world, and will perish with the world. But it is a far
   easier thing to satisfy conscience with a pretence of preserving
   church-unity, by an acquiescency in some outward rules and
   constitutions, wherein men's minds are little concerned, than to attend
   diligently unto the due exercise of this grace of love against all
   oppositions and temptations unto the contrary; for indeed the exercise
   of this love requires a sedulous and painful "labour," Heb. vi. 10. But
   yet this is that alone which is the bond of perfection unto the
   disciples of Christ, and without which all other pretences or
   appearances of unity are of no value with him. Secondly, This love acts
   itself by forbearance and condescension towards the infirmities,
   mistakes, and faults of others; wherein of what singular use it is for
   the preservation of church peace and order, the apostle at large
   declares, 1 Cor. xiii.

   Fourthly, The Lord Christ, by his kingly authority, hath instituted
   orders for rule, and ordinances for worship, Matt. xxviii. 19, 20; Eph.
   iv. 8-13, to be observed in all his churches. That they be attended
   unto, and celebrated in a due manner, belongs unto the unity which he
   requires among his disciples. To this end he communicates supplies of
   spiritual ability and wisdom, or the gifts of his Spirit, unto the
   guides and rulers of his churches, for their administration unto
   edification. And hereon, if a submission unto his authority be
   accompanied with a due attendance unto the rule of the word, no such
   variety or difference will ensue as shall impeach that unity which is
   the duty of them all to attend unto.

   In these things doth consist that evangelical church-unity which the
   gospel recommends unto us, and which the Lord Christ prayed for, with
   respect unto all that should believe on his name, John xvii. 20-23. One
   Spirit, one faith, one love, one Lord, there ought to be in and unto
   them all. In the possession of this unity, and no other, were the first
   churches left by the apostles; and had they in succeeding generations
   continued, according to their duty, in the preservation and liberty of
   it, all those scandalous divisions which afterward fell out among them,
   on account of pre-eminences, jurisdictions, liturgies, rites,
   ceremonies, violently or fraudulently obtruded on their communion, had
   been prevented, 2 Cor. x. 4, 5.

   The ways and means whereby this unity may be obtained and preserved
   amongst Christians are evident from the nature of it: for whereas it is
   spiritual, none other are suited thereunto, nor hath the Lord Christ
   appointed any other but his Spirit and his word; for to this end doth
   he promise the presence of his Spirit among them that believe unto the
   consummation of all things, Matt. xxviii. 20; John xiv. 16. And this he
   doth, both as to lead and "guide them into all truth" necessary unto
   the ends mentioned, so to assist and help them in the orderly
   performance of their duties in and about them. His word, also, as the
   rule which they are to attend unto, he hath committed unto them. And
   other ways and means for the compassing of this end, besides the due
   improvement of spiritual assistances in a compliance with the holy
   rule, he hath not desired or appointed.

   This is that gospel unity which we are to labour after, and these are
   the means whereby we may do so. But now, through the mistake of the
   minds of men, with the strong influence which carnal and corrupt
   interests have upon them, we know how it hath been despised, and what
   hath been set up in the room thereof, and what have been the means
   whereby it hath been pursued and promoted. We may take an instance in
   those of the church of Rome. No sort of Christians in the world (as we
   have already observed) do at this day more pretend unto unity, or more
   press the necessity of it, or more fiercely judge, oppose, and destroy
   others for the breach of it, which they charge upon them, nor more
   prevail or advantage themselves by the pretence of it, than do they;
   but yet, notwithstanding all their pretences, it will not be denied but
   that the unity which they so make their boast of, and press upon
   others, is a thing utterly foreign to the gospel, and destructive of
   that peace, union, and concord among Christians which it doth require.
   They know how highly unity is commended in the Scripture, how much it
   is to be prized and valued by all true believers, how acceptable it is
   to Jesus Christ, and how severely they are condemned who break it or
   despise it: these things they press, and plead, and make their
   advantage by. But when we come to inquire what it is that they intend
   by church-unity, they tell us long stories of subjection unto the pope,
   -- to the church in its dictates and resolutions, without farther
   examination, merely because they are theirs. Now, these things are not
   only of another nature and kind than the unity and concord commended
   unto us by Jesus Christ, but perfectly inconsistent with them, and
   destructive of them. And as they would impose upon us a corrupt
   confederacy, for their own secular advantage, in the room of the
   spiritual unity of the gospel; so it was necessary that they should
   find out means suitable unto its accomplishment and preservation, as
   distant from the means appointed by Christ for the attaining of gospel
   union as their carnal confederacy is from the thing itself. And they
   have done accordingly; for the enforcing men, by all ways of deceit and
   outward violence, unto a compliance with and submission unto their
   orders, is the great expedient for the establishment and preservation
   of their perverse union that they have fixed on. Now, that this
   fictitious unity and corrupt carnal pursuit of it have been the
   greatest occasion and cause of begetting, fomenting, and continuing the
   divisions that are among Christians in the world, hath been undeniably
   proved by learned men of all sorts. And so it will fall out, wherever
   any reject the union of Christ's institution, and substitute in the
   room thereof an agreement of their own invention; as his will be
   utterly lost, so they will not be able to retain their own.

   Thus, others also, not content with those bounds and measures which the
   gospel hath fixed unto the unity of Christians and churches, will have
   it to consist almost wholly in an outward conformity unto certain
   rites, orders, ceremonies, and modes of sacred administrations, which
   themselves have either invented and found out or do observe and
   approve. Whoever dissents from them in these things must immediately be
   branded as a schismatic, a divider of the church's unity, and an enemy
   unto the peace and order of it. Howbeit, of conformity unto such
   institutions and orders of men, of uniformity in the observation of
   such external rites in the worship of the church, there is not one word
   spoken, nor any thing of that nature intimated, in all the commands for
   unity which are given unto us, nor in the directions that are
   sanctified unto the due preservation of it. Yet such a uniformity being
   set up in the room of evangelical unity and order, means suited unto
   the preservation of it, but really destructive of that whose name it
   beareth and whose place it possesseth, have not been wanting. And it is
   not unworthy of consideration how men endeavour to deceive others, and
   are deceived themselves, by manifold equivocations in their arguings
   about this matter. For, first, they lay down the necessity of unity
   among Christians, with the evil that is in breaches, divisions, and
   schisms; which they prove from the commands of the one and the reproofs
   of the other that abound in the Scripture. Then, with an easy
   deduction, they prove that it is a duty incumbent on all Christians, in
   their several capacities, to observe, keep, further, and promote this
   unity; and to prevent, oppose, resist, and avoid all divisions that are
   contrary thereunto. If so, the magistrate must do the same in his place
   and capacity. Now, seeing it is his office, and unto him of God it is
   committed, to exercise his power in laws and penalties for the
   promoting of what is good, and the punishing of what is contrary
   thereunto, it is his duty to coerce, restrain, and punish, all those
   who oppose, despise, or any way break or disturb, the unity of the
   church. And this ratiocination would seem reasonable were it not doubly
   defective. For, first, the unity intended in the first proposition,
   whose necessity is confirmed by Scripture testimonies, is utterly lost
   before we come to the conclusion, and the outward uniformity mentioned
   is substituted in the room thereof. And hereby, in the second place,
   are they deceived to believe that external force and penalties are a
   means to be used by any for the attaining or preserving of gospel
   unity. It is not improbable, indeed, but that it may be suited to give
   countenance unto that external uniformity which is intended; but that
   it should be so unto the promotion of gospel union among believers is a
   weak imagination. Let such persons keep themselves and their argument
   unto that union which the Scripture commends amongst the disciples of
   Christ and his churches, with the means fitted and appointed unto the
   preservation of it, and they shall have our compliance with any
   conclusion that will thence ensue.

   Herein, therefore, lies the fundamental cause of our divisions; which
   will not be healed until it be removed and taken out of the way. Leave
   believers or professors of the gospel unto their duty in seeking after
   evangelical unity in the use of other means instituted and blessed unto
   that end, -- impose nothing on their consciences or practice under that
   name, which indeed belongs not thereunto; and although, upon the
   reasons and causes afterward to be mentioned, there may for a season
   remain some divisions among them, yet there will be a way of healing
   continually ready for them, and agreed upon by them as such. Where,
   indeed, men propose unto themselves different ends, though under the
   same name, the use of the same means for the compassing of them will
   but increase their variance: as where some aim at evangelical union,
   and others at an external uniformity, both under the name of unity and
   peace, in the use of the same means for these ends, they will be more
   divided among themselves. But where the same end is aimed at, even the
   debate of the means for the attaining of it will insensibly bring the
   parties into a coalition, and work out in the issue a complete
   reconciliation. In the meantime, were Christians duly instructed how
   many lesser differences, in mind, and judgment, and practice, are
   really consistent with the nature, ends, and genuine fruit, of the
   unity that Christ requires among them, it would undoubtedly prevail
   with them so to manage themselves in their differences, by mutual
   forbearance and condescension in love, as not to contract the guilt of
   being disturbers or breakers of it; for suppose the minds of any of
   them to be invincibly prepossessed with the principles wherein they
   differ from others, yet all who are sincere in their profession cannot
   but rejoice to be directed unto such a managery of them as to be
   preserved from the guilt of dissolving the unity appointed by Christ to
   be observed. And, to speak plainly, among all the churches in the world
   which are free from idolatry and persecution, it is not different
   opinions, or a difference in judgment about revealed truths, nor a
   different practice in sacred administrations, but pride, self-interest,
   love of honour, reputation, and dominion, with the influence of civil
   or political intrigues and considerations, that are the true cause of
   that defect of evangelical unity that is at this day amongst them; for
   set them aside, and the real differences which would remain may be so
   managed, in love, gentleness, and meekness, as not to interfere with
   that unity which Christ requireth them to preserve. Nothing will from
   thence follow which shall impeach their common interest in one Lord,
   one faith, one love, one Spirit, and the administration of the same
   ordinances according to their light and ability. But if we shall cast
   away this evangelical union among the disciples and churches of Christ,
   -- if we shall break up the bounds and limits fixed unto it, and set up
   in its place a compliance with, or an agreement in, the commands and
   appointments of men, making their observations the rule and measure of
   our ecclesiastical concord, -- it cannot be but that innumerable and
   endless divisions will ensue thereon. If we will not be contented with
   the union that Christ hath appointed, it is certain that we shall have
   none in this world; for concerning that which is of men's finding out,
   there have been, and will be, contentions and divisions, whilst there
   are any on the one side who will endeavour its imposition, and on the
   other who desire to preserve their consciences entire unto the
   authority of Christ in his laws and appointments.

   There is none who can be such a stranger in our Israel as not to know
   that these things have been the great occasion and cause of the
   divisions and contentions that have been among us near a hundred years,
   and which at this day make our breaches wide like the sea, that they
   cannot be healed. Let, therefore, those who have power and ability be
   instrumental to restore to the minds of men the true notion and
   knowledge of the unity which the Lord Christ requireth among his
   churches and disciples; and let them be left unto that liberty which he
   hath purchased for them, in the pursuit of that unity which he hath
   prescribed unto them; and let us all labour to stir up those gracious
   principles of love and peace which ought to guide us in the use of our
   liberty, and will enable us to preserve gospel unity; -- and there will
   be a greater progress made towards peace, reconciliation, and concord,
   amongst all sorts of Christians, than the spoiling of the goods or
   imprisoning the persons of dissenters will ever effect. But, it may be,
   such things are required hereunto as the world is yet scarce able to
   comply withal; for whilst men do hardly believe that there is an
   efficacy and power accompanying the institutions of Christ, for the
   compassing of that whole end which he aimeth at and intendeth, --
   whilst they are unwilling to be brought unto the constant exercise of
   that spiritual diligence, patience, meekness, condescension,
   self-denial, renunciation of the world and conformity thereunto, which
   are indispensably necessary in church guides and church members,
   according to their measure, unto the attaining and preservation of
   gospel unity, but do satisfy themselves in the disposal of an
   ecclesiastical union into a subordination unto their own secular
   interests, by external force and power, -- we have very small
   expectation of success in the way proposed. In the meantime, we are
   herewith satisfied: Take the churches of Christ in the world that are
   not infected with idolatry or persecution, and restore their unity unto
   the terms and conditions left unto them by Christ and his apostles, and
   if in any thing we are found uncompliant therewithal, we shall without
   repining bear the reproach of it, and hasten an amendment.

   2. Another cause of the evil effects and consequences mentioned is, the
   great neglect that hath been in churches and church rulers in the
   pursuance of the open, direct ends of the gospel, both as to the
   doctrine and discipline of it. This hath been such and so evident in
   the world that it is altogether in vain for any to deny it, or to
   attempt an excuse of it. And men have no reason to flatter themselves
   that, whilst they live in an open neglect of their own duty, others
   will always, according to their wills or desires, attend with diligence
   unto what they prescribe unto them. If churches or their rulers could
   excuse or justify their members in all the evils that may befall them
   through their miscarriages and maladministrations, it might justly be
   expected that they should go along with them under their conduct,
   whither ever they should lead them: but if it can never be obliterated
   out of the minds and consciences of men that they must every one live
   by his own faith, and every one give an account of himself unto God;
   and that everyone, notwithstanding the interposition of the help of
   churches and their rulers, is obliged immediately, in his own person,
   to take care of his whole duty towards God; it cannot be but that in
   such cases they will judge for themselves, and what is meet for them to
   do. In case, therefore, that they find the churches whereunto they do
   relate under the guilt of the neglect mentioned, it is probable that
   they will provide for themselves and their own safety. In this state of
   things it is morally impossible but that differences and divisions will
   fall out, which might all of them have been prevented had there been a
   due attention unto the work, doctrine, order, and discipline of the
   gospel in the churches that were in possession of the care and
   administration of them; for it is hard for men to believe that, by the
   will and command of Christ, they are inevitably shut up under spiritual
   disadvantages, seeing it is certain that he hath ordered all things in
   the church for their edification. But the consideration of some
   particular instances will render this cause of our divisions more
   evident and manifest.

   The first end of preaching the gospel is, the conversion of the souls
   of men unto God, Acts xxvi. 17, 18. This, we suppose, will not be
   questioned or denied. That the work hereof, in all churches, ought to
   be attended and pursued with zeal, diligence, labour, and care, all
   accompanied with constant and fervent prayers for success, in and by
   the ministers and rulers of them, is a truth also that will not admit
   of any controversy among them that believe the gospel, 1 Tim. v. 17; 2
   Tim. iv. 1, 2. Herein principally do men in office in the church
   exercise and manifest their zeal for the glory of God, their compassion
   towards the souls of men, and acquit themselves faithfully in the trust
   committed unto them by the "great Shepherd of the sheep," Christ Jesus.
   If, now, in any assembly or other societies professing themselves to be
   churches of Christ, and claiming the right and power of churches
   towards all persons living within the bounds or limits which they have
   prescribed unto themselves, this work be either totally neglected, or
   carelessly and perfunctorily attended unto; if those on whom it is
   immediately incumbent do either suppose themselves free from any
   obligation thereunto, upon the pretence of other engagements, or do so
   dispose of themselves, in their relation unto many charges or
   employments, as that it is impossible they should duly attend unto it,
   or are unable and insufficient for it; so that, indeed, there is not in
   such churches a due representation of the love, care, and kindness of
   the Lord Jesus Christ towards the souls of men, which he hath ordained
   the administration of his gospel to testify, -- it cannot be but that
   great thoughts of heart, and no small disorder of mind, will be
   occasioned in them who understand aright how much the principal end of
   constituting churches in this world is neglected among them. And
   although it is their duty for a season patiently to bear with, and
   quietly seek the reformation of, this evil in the churches whereunto
   they do belong, yet when they find themselves excluded, -- it may be by
   the very constitution of the church itself, it may be by the iniquity
   of them that prevail therein, -- from the performance of any thing that
   tends thereunto, it will increase their disquietment. And whereas men
   do not join themselves, nor are by any other ways joined, unto
   churches, for any civil or secular ends or purposes, but merely for the
   promotion of God's glory, and the edification of their own souls in
   faith and gospel obedience, it is altogether vain for any to endeavour
   a satisfaction of their consciences that it is sin to withdraw from
   such churches, wherein these ends are not pursued nor attainable; and
   yet a confidence hereof is that which hath countenanced sundry
   church-guides into that neglect of duty which many complain of and
   groan under at this day.

   The second end of the dispensation of the gospel, in the assemblies of
   the churches of Christ, by the ministers of them, is the edification of
   them that are converted unto God and do believe. Herein consists that
   feeding of his sheep and lambs that the Lord Christ hath committed unto
   them; and it is mentioned as the principal end for which the ministry
   was ordained, or for which pastors and teachers are granted unto the
   church, Eph. iv. 8-13. And the Scripture abounds in the declaration of
   what skill and knowledge in the mystery of the gospel, what attendance
   unto the word and prayer, what care, watchfulness, and diligent labour
   in the word and doctrine, are required unto a due discharge of the
   ministerial duty. Where it is omitted or neglected; where it is
   carelessly attended unto; where those on whom it is incumbent do act
   more like hirelings than true shepherds; where they want skill to
   divide the word aright, or wisdom and knowledge to declare from it "the
   whole counsel of God," or diligence to be urgent continually in the
   application of it -- they are like to be exercised withal who make
   conscience of the performance of their own duty, and understand the
   necessity of enjoying the means that Christ hath appointed for their
   edification. And it is certain that such churches will in vain, or at
   least unjustly, expect that professors of the gospel should abide in
   their particular communion, when they cannot or do not provide food for
   their souls, whereby they may live to God. Unless all the members of
   such churches are equally asleep in security, divisions among them will
   in this case ensue. Will any disciple of Christ esteem himself obliged
   to starve his own soul for the sake of communion with them who have
   sinfully destroyed the principal end of all church-communion? Is there
   any law of Christ, or any rule of the gospel, or any duty of love, that
   requires them so to do? The sole immediate end of men's joining in
   churches being their own edification and usefulness unto others, can
   they be bound in conscience always to abide there, or in the communion
   of those churches where it is not to be attained, where the means of it
   are utterly cast aside? This may become such as know not their duty,
   nor care to be instructed in it, and are willing to perish in and for
   the company of others; but for them which in such cases shall provide,
   according to the rules of the gospel, for themselves and their own
   safety, they may be censured, judged, and severely treated, by them
   whose interest and advantage it is so to do, -- they may be despised by
   riotous persons, who sport themselves with their own deceivings, -- but
   with the Lord Christ, the judge of all, they will be accepted. And they
   do but increase the dread of their own account, who, under pretence of
   church power and order, would forcibly shut up Christians in such a
   condition as wherein they are kept short of all the true ends of the
   institution of churches. To suppose, therefore, that every voluntary
   departure from the constant communion of such churches, made with a
   design of joining unto those where the word is dispensed with more
   diligence and efficacy, is a schism from the church of Christ, is to
   suppose that which neither the Scripture nor reason will give the least
   countenance unto. And it would better become such churches to return
   industriously unto a faithful discharge of their duty, whereby this
   occasion of divisions may be removed out of the way, than to attempt
   their own justification by the severe prosecution of such as depart
   from them.

   Thirdly, In pursuit of the doctrine of the gospel so improved and
   applied, it is the known and open duty of churches, in their guides or
   ministers, by all means to countenance and promote the growth of light,
   knowledge, godliness, strictness, and fruitfulness of conversation, in
   those members of them in whom they may be found, or do appear in an
   especial manner. Such are they to own, encourage, and make their
   companions, and endeavour that others may become like unto them. For
   unless men, in their ordinary and common conversation, in their
   affections, and the interest which they have in the administration of
   discipline, do uniformly answer the doctrine of truth which they
   preach, it cannot be avoided but that it will be matter of offence unto
   others, and of reproach to themselves. Much more will it be so, if,
   instead of these things, those who preside in the churches shall beat
   their fellow-servants, and eat and drink with the drunken. But by all
   ways it is their duty to separate the precious from the vile, if they
   intend to be as the mouth of the Lord, even in their judgments,
   affections, and conversations. And herein what wisdom, patience,
   diligence, love, condescension, and forbearance are required, they
   alone know, and they full well know, who for any season have in their
   places conscientiously endeavoured the discharge of their duty. But
   whatever be the labour which is to be undergone therein, and the
   trouble wherewith it is attended, it is that which, by the appointment
   of Christ, all ministers of the gospel are obliged to attend unto. They
   are not, by contrary actings, to make sad the hearts of them whom God
   would not have made sad, nor to strengthen the hands of them whom God
   would not have encouraged, as they will answer it at their peril. The
   hearts of church guides, and of those who in an especial manner fear
   God, thriving in knowledge and grace under the dispensation of the
   word, ought to be knit together in all holy affections, that they may
   together grow up into him who is the Head; for where there is the
   greatest evidence and manifestation of the power and presence of Christ
   in any, there ought their affections to be most intense. For as such
   persons are the crown, the joy and rejoicing of their guides, and will
   appear to be so in the day of the Lord; so they do know, or may easily
   do so, what obligations are on them to honour and pay all due respects
   unto their teachers, how much on all accounts they owe unto them;
   whereby their mutual love may be confirmed. And where there is this
   uniformity between the doctrine of the gospel as preached, and the
   duties of it as practised, then are they both beautiful in the eyes of
   all believers, and effectual unto their proper ends. But where things
   in churches, through their negligence or corruption, or that of their
   guides, are quite otherwise, it is easy to conjecture what will ensue
   thereon. If those who are forwardest in profession, who give the
   greatest evidence that they have received the power of that religion
   which is taught and owned among them, who have apparently attained a
   growth in spiritual light and knowledge above others, shall be so far
   from being peculiarly cherished and regarded, from being loved, liked,
   or associated withal, as that on the other side they shall be marked,
   observed, reproached, and it may be on every slight provocation put
   even to outward trouble; whilst men of worldly and profane
   conversation, ignorant, perhaps riotous and debauched, shall be the
   delight and companions of church guides and rulers; -- it cannot be
   that such churches should long continue in peace, nor is that peace
   wherein they continue much to be valued. An agreement in such ways and
   practices is rather to be esteemed a conspiracy against Christ and
   holiness than church order or concord; and when men once find
   themselves hated, and it may be persecuted, for no other cause, as they
   believe, but because they labour in their lives and professions to
   express the power of that truth wherein they have been instructed, they
   can hardly avoid the entertainment of severe thoughts concerning them
   from whom they had just reason to expect other usage, and also to
   provide for their own more peaceable encouragement and edification.

   Fourthly, Hereunto also belongeth the due exercise of gospel
   discipline, according to the mind of Christ. It is, indeed, by some
   called into question whether there be any rule or discipline appointed
   by Christ to be exercised in his churches. But this doubt must respect
   such outward forms and modes of the administration of these things as
   are supposed, but not proved necessary: for whether the Lord Christ
   hath appointed some to rule and some to be ruled; whether he hath
   prescribed laws or rules, whereby the one should govern and the other
   obey; whether he hath determined the matter, manner, and end of this
   rule and government, -- cannot well be called into controversy by such
   as profess to believe the gospel. Of what nature or kind these
   governors or rulers are to be, what is their office, how they are to be
   invested therewith, and by what authority, how they are to behave
   themselves in the administration of the laws of the church, are things
   determined by him in the word. And for the matters about which they are
   to be conversant, it is evidently declared of what nature they are, how
   they are to be managed, and to what end. The qualifications and duties
   of those who are to be admitted into the church, their deportment in
   it, their removal from it, are all expressed in the laws and directions
   given unto the same end. In particular, it is ordained that those who
   are unruly or disorderly, who walk contrary unto the rules and ways of
   holiness prescribed unto the church, shall be rebuked, admonished,
   instructed; and if, after all means used for their amendment, they
   abide in impenitency, that they be ejected out of communion. For the
   church, as visible, is a society gathered and erected to express and
   declare the holiness of Christ, and the power of his grace in his
   person and doctrine; and where this is not done, no church is of any
   advantage unto the interests of his glory in this world. The
   preservation, therefore, of holiness in them, whereof the discipline
   mentioned is an effectual means, is as necessary and of the same
   importance with the preservation of their being. The Lord Christ hath
   also expressly ordained, that in case offences should arise in and
   among his churches, that in and by them they should be composed,
   according to the rules of the word and his own laws; and, in
   particular, that in sinful miscarriages causing offence or scandal,
   there be a regular proceeding, according unto an especial law and
   constitution of his, for the removal of the offence and recovery of the
   offender; as also, that those who in other cases have fallen by the
   power of temptation should be restored by a spirit of meekness; and,
   not to instance in more particulars, that the whole flock be
   continually watched over, exhorted, warned, instructed, comforted, as
   the necessities or occasions of the whole, or the several members of
   it, do require. Now, supposing these and the like laws, rules, and
   directions, to be given and enjoined by the authority of Christ (which
   gives warranty for their execution unto men prudent for the ordering of
   affairs according to their necessary circumstances, and believers of
   the gospel, doing all things in obedience unto him), we judge that a
   complete rule or government is erected thereby in the church. However,
   we know that the exercise of discipline in every church, so far as the
   laws and rules of it are expressed in the Scripture, and the ends of it
   directed unto, is as necessary as any duty enjoined unto us in the
   whole course of our gospel obedience. And where this is neglected, it
   is in vain for any churches to expect peace and unity in their
   communion, seeing itself neglecteth the principal means of them. It is
   pleaded, that the mixture of those that are wicked and ungodly in the
   sacred administrations of the church doth neither defile the
   administrations themselves, nor render them unuseful unto those who are
   rightly interested in them and duly prepared for the participation of
   them. Hence, that no church ought to be forsaken, nor its communion
   withdrawn from, merely on that account, many of old and of late have
   pleaded. Nor do we say that this solely of itself is sufficient to
   justify a separation from any church. But when a church shall tolerate
   in its communion not only evil men, but their evils, and absolutely
   refuse to use the discipline of Christ for the reformation of the one
   and the taking away of the other, there is great danger lest the "whole
   lump be leavened," and the edification of particular persons be
   obstructed beyond what the Lord Christ requires of them to submit unto
   and to acquiesce in.

   Neither will things have any better success where the discipline
   degenerates into an outward forcible jurisdiction and power. The things
   of Christ are to be administered with the spirit of Christ. Such a
   frame of heart and mind as was in him is required of all that act under
   him and in his name. Wherefore, charity, pity, compassion,
   condescension, meekness, and forbearance, with those other graces which
   were so glorious and conspicuous in him and in all that he did, are to
   bear sway in the minds of them who exercise this care and duty for him
   in the church. To set up such a form of the administration of
   discipline, or to commit the exercise of it unto such persons, as
   whereby or by whom the Lord Christ, in his rule of the church, would be
   represented as furious, captious, proud, covetous, oppressive, is not
   the way to honour him in the world, nor to preserve the peace of the
   churches. And indeed some, while they boast of the imitation of Christ
   and his example, in opposition to his grace, do in their lives and
   practices make unto the world a representation of the devil. But an
   account of this degeneracy is given so distinctly by Pietro Soave, [3]
   the author of the History of the Council of Trent, lib. iv. ad ann.
   1551, that we think it not unmeet to express it in his own words. He
   saith, therefore, that "Christ having commanded his apostles to preach
   the gospel and administer the sacraments, he left also unto them, in
   the person of all the faithful, this principal precept, to love one
   another, charging them to make peace between those that dissented; and,
   for the last remedy, giving the care thereof to the body of the church,
   promising it should be bound and loosed in heaven, whatever they did
   bind and loose, on earth, and that whatever they did ask with a common
   consent should be granted by the Father. In this charitable office, to
   give satisfaction to the offended and pardon to the offender, the
   primitive church was always exercised. And in conformity to this, St
   Paul ordained that brethren having civil suits one against another
   should not go to the tribunals of infidels, but that wise men should be
   appointed to judge the differences. And this was a kind of civil
   judgment, as the other had the similitude of a criminal; but were both
   so different from the judgments of the world, that as these are
   executed by the power of the judge, who enforceth submission, so those
   only by the will of the guilty to receive them, who refusing of them,
   the ecclesiastical judge remaineth without execution, and hath no power
   but to foreshow the judgment of God, which, according to his omnipotent
   good pleasure, will follow in this life or the next. And, indeed, the
   ecclesiastical judgment did deserve the name of charity, in regard that
   it did only induce the guilty to submit, and the church to judge with
   such sincerity, that neither in the one any bad effect could have
   place, nor just complaint in the other; and the excess of charity in
   correcting did make the corrector to feel greater pain than the
   corrected, so that in the church no punishment was imposed without
   lamentation in the multitude, and greater of the better sort. And this
   was the cause why to correct was called to lament.' So St Paul,
   rebuking of the Corinthians for not chastising the incestuous, said, Ye
   have not lamented to separate such a transgressor from you.' And in
   another epistle, I fear that when I come unto you, I shall not find you
   such as I desire, but in contentions and tumults, and that at my coming
   I shall lament many of those who have sinned before.' The judgment of
   the church (as it is necessary in every multitude) was fit that it
   should be conducted by one, who should preside and guide the action,
   propose the matters, and collect the points to be consulted on. This
   care, due to the most principal and worthy person, was always committed
   to the bishop; and when the churches were many, the propositions and
   deliberations were made by the bishop first in the college of the
   priests and deacons, which they called the presbytery, and there were
   ripened, to receive afterward the last resolution in the general
   congregation of the church. This form was still on foot in the year
   250, and is plainly seen by the epistles of Cyprian; who, in the matter
   concerning those who did eat of meats offered to idols, and subscribe
   to the religion of the Gentiles, writeth to the presbytery that he doth
   not think to do any thing without their counsel and consent of the
   people; and writeth to the people, that at his return he will examine
   the causes and merits thereof in their presence and under their
   judgment; and he wrote to those priests who of their own brain had
   reconciled some, that they should give an account to the people.

   "The goodness and charity of the bishops made their opinion for the
   most part to be followed, and by little and little was cause that the
   church, charity waxing cold, not regarding the charge laid upon them by
   Christ, did lean the ear to the bishop; and ambition, a witty passion,
   which doth insinuate itself in the show of virtue, did cause it to be
   readily embraced. But the principal cause of the change was the ceasing
   of the persecutions; for then the bishops did erect, as it were, a
   tribunal, which was much frequented; because, as temporal commodities,
   so suits did increase. This judgment, though it were not as the former
   in regard of the form, to determine all by the opinion of the church,
   yet it was of the same sincerity. Whereupon Constantine, seeing how
   profitable it was to determine causes, and that by the authority of
   religion captious actions were discovered which the judges could not
   penetrate, made a law that there should be no appeal from the sentences
   of bishops, which should be executed by the secular judge. And if, in a
   cause depending before a secular tribunal, in any state thereof, either
   of the parties, though the other contradict, shall demand the episcopal
   judgment, the cause shall be immediately remitted to him. Here the
   tribunal of the bishop began to be a common pleading-place, having
   execution by the ministry of the magistrate, and to gain the name of
   episcopal jurisdiction, episcopal audience, and such like. The emperor
   Valens did enlarge it, who in the year 365 gave the bishops the care
   over all the prices of vendible things. This judicial negotiation
   pleased not the good bishops. Possidonius doth recount that Austin
   being employed herein, sometimes until dinner-time, sometimes longer,
   was wont to say that it was a trouble, and did divert him from doing
   things proper unto him; and himself writeth, that it was to leave
   things profitable and to attend things tumultuous and perplexed. And St
   Paul did not take it unto himself, as being not fit for a preacher, but
   would have it given to others. Afterward, some bishops beginning to
   abuse the authority given them by the law of Constantine, that was
   seventy years after revoked by Arcadius and Honorius, and an ordinance
   made that they should judge causes of religion, and not civil, except
   both parties did consent, and declared that they should not be thought
   to have a court; which law being not much observed in Rome, in regard
   of the great power of the bishops, Valentinian being in the city in the
   year 452, did renew it, and made it to be put in execution. But a
   little after, some part of the power taken away was restored by the
   princes that followed, so that Justinian did establish unto them a
   court and audience, and assigned unto them the causes of religion, the
   ecclesiastical faults of the clergy, and divers voluntary jurisdictions
   also over the laity. By these degrees the charitable correction of
   Christ did degenerate into domination, and made Christians lose their
   ancient reverence and obedience. It is denied in words that
   ecclesiastical jurisdiction is dominion as is the secular, yet one
   knoweth not how to put a difference between them. But St Paul did put
   it when he wrote to Timothy, and repeated it to Titus, that a bishop
   should not be greedy of gain, nor a striker. Now, on the contrary, they
   made men pay for processes, and imprisoned the parties, as is done in
   the secular court," etc.

   This degeneracy of discipline was long since esteemed burdensome, and
   looked on as the cause of innumerable troubles and grievances unto all
   sorts of people; yea, it hath had no better esteem among them who had
   little or no acquaintance with what is taught concerning these things
   in the Scripture, only they found an inconsistency in it with those
   laws and privileges of their several countries whereby their civil
   liberties and advantages were confirmed unto them. And if at any time
   it take place or prevail amongst persons of more light and knowledge,
   who are able to compare it or the practice of it with the institutions
   of Christ in the gospel, and the manner of the administration therein
   also directed, it greatly alienates the minds of men from the communion
   of such churches. Especially it doth so if set up unto an exclusion of
   that benign, kind, spiritual, and every way useful discipline that
   Christ hath appointed to be exercised in his church. When corruptions
   and abuses were come to the height in the Papacy in this matter, we
   know what ensued thereon. Divines, indeed, and sundry other persons
   learned and godly, did principally insist on the errors and heresies
   which prevailed in the church of Rome, with the defilements and
   abominations of their worship. But that which alienated the minds of
   princes, magistrates, and whole nations from them, was the
   ecclesiastical domination which they had craftily erected and cunningly
   managed unto the ends of their own ambition, power, and avarice, under
   the name of church rule and discipline. And wherever any thing of the
   same kind is continued, -- that a rule under the same pretence is
   erected and exercised in any church after the nature of secular courts,
   by force and power, put forth in legal citations, penalties, pecuniary
   mulcts, without an open evidence of men being acted in what they do
   herein by love, charity, compassion towards the souls of men, zeal for
   the glory of God and honour of Christ, with a design for the purity,
   holiness, and reformation of the members of it, -- that church may not
   expect unity and peace any longer than the terror of its proceedings
   doth overbalance other thoughts and desires proceeding from a sense of
   duty in all that belong unto it. Yea, whatever is or is to be the
   manner of the administration of discipline in the church, about which
   there may be doubtful disputations, which men of an ordinary capacity
   may not be able clearly to determine, yet if the avowed end of it be
   not the purity and holiness of the church, and if the effects of it in
   a tendency unto that end be not manifest, it is hard to find out whence
   our obligation to a compliance with it should arise. And where an
   outward conformity unto some church-order is aimed at alone, in the
   room of all other things, it will quickly prove itself to be nothing or
   of no value in the sight of Christ. And these things do alienate the
   minds of many from an acquiescence in their stations or relations to
   such churches; for the principal enforcements of men's obedience and
   reverence unto the rulers of the church are because they "watch
   diligently for the good of their souls, as those that must give an
   account," Heb. xiii. 17. And if they see such set over them as give no
   evidence of any such watchful care acting itself according to those
   Scripture directions which are continually read unto them, but rather
   rule them with force and rigour, seeking theirs, not them, they grow
   weary of the yoke, and sometimes regularly, sometimes irregularly,
   contrive their own freedom and deliverance.

   It may not here be amiss to inquire into the reasons and occasions that
   have seduced churches and their rulers into the miscarriages insisted
   on. Now, these are chiefly some principles with their application that
   they have trusted unto, but which indeed have really deceived them, and
   will yet continue so to do.

   1. And the first of these is, that whereas they are true churches, and
   thereon intrusted with all church power and privileges, they need not
   farther concern themselves to seek for grounds or warranty to keep up
   all their members unto their communion; for be they otherwise what they
   will, so long as they are true churches, it is their duty to abide in
   their peace and order. If any call their church-state into question,
   they take no consideration of them but how they may be punished, it may
   be destroyed, as perverse schismatics. And they are ready to suppose,
   that upon an acknowledgment that they are true churches, every dissent
   from them in anything must needs be criminal, -- as if it were all one
   to be a true church -- a supposition including a nullity in the state
   of those churches which in the least differ from them, than which there
   is no more uncharitable nor schismatical principle in the world. But in
   the common definition of schism, that it is a causeless separation from
   a true church, that term of causeless is very little considered or
   weighed by them whose interest it is to lay the charge of it on others.
   And hence it is come to pass, that wherever there have been complaints
   of faults, miscarriages, errors, defections of churches, in late ages,
   their counsels have only been how to destroy the complainers, not in
   the least how they should reform themselves; as though, in church
   affairs, truth, right and equity, were entailed on power and
   possession. How the complaints concerning the church of Rome, quickened
   by the outcries of so many provinces of Europe, and evidence and matter
   of fact, were eluded and frustrated in the council of Trent, leaving
   all things to be tried out by interest and force, is full well known.
   For they know that no reformation can be attempted and accomplished,
   but it will be a business of great labour, care, and trouble, things
   not delightful unto the minds of men at ease. Besides, as it may
   possibly ruffle or discompose some of the chiefs in their present ways
   or enjoyments, so it will, as they fear, tend to their disreputation,
   as though they had formerly been out of the way or neglective of their
   duty: and this, as they suppose, would draw after it another
   inconvenience, by reflecting on them and their practices as the
   occasions of former disorders and divisions. They choose, therefore,
   generally to flatter themselves under the name and authority of the
   church, and lay up their defence and security against an humble,
   painful reformation, in a plea that they need it not. So was it with
   the church of Laodicea of old, who, in the height of her decaying
   condition, flattered herself "that she was rich, and increased with
   goods, and had need of nothing; and knew not," or would not
   acknowledge, "that she was wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
   blind, and naked," Rev. iii. 17. Now, it cannot but seem exceeding
   strange, unto men who wisely consider these things, that, whereas the
   churches which were planted and watered by the apostles themselves, and
   enjoyed for some good season the presence and advantage of their
   infallible guidance to preserve them in their original purity and
   order, did within a few years, many of them, so degenerate and stand in
   need of reformation, that our Lord Jesus Christ threatened from heaven
   to cast them off and destroy them, unless they did speedily reform
   themselves according to his mind, those now in the world, ordered at
   first by persons fallible, and who in many things were actually
   deceived, should so continue in their purity and holiness from age to
   age as to stand in need of no reformation or amendment. Well will it be
   if it prove so at the great day of visitation. In the meantime, it
   becomes the guides of all the churches in the world to take care that
   there do not such decays of truth, holiness, and purity in worship,
   fall out under their hand in the churches wherein they preside, as that
   for them they should be rejected by our Lord Jesus Christ, as he
   threatens to deal with those who are guilty of such defections; for the
   state of the generality of churches is such at this day in the world,
   as he who thinks them not to stand in need of any reformation may
   justly be looked on as a part of their sinful degeneracy. We are not
   ignorant what is usually pleaded in bar unto all endeavours after
   church reformation; for they say, "If, upon the clamours of a few
   humorous, discontented persons, whom nothing will please, and who,
   perhaps, are not agreed among themselves, a reformation must instantly
   be made or attempted, there will be nothing stable, firm, or sacred
   left in the church, -- things once well established are not to be
   called into question upon every one's exceptions." And these things are
   vehemently pleaded and urged, to the exclusion of all thoughts of
   changing anything, though evidently for the better. But long-continued
   complaints and petitions of multitudes, whose sincerity hath received
   as great an attestation as human nature or Christian religion can give,
   it may be, deserve not to be so despised. However, the jealousy which
   churches and their rulers ought to have over themselves, their state
   and condition, and the presence of the glory of Christ among them, or
   its departure from them, especially considering the fearful example of
   the defection and apostasy of many churches, which is continually
   before their eyes, seems to require a readiness in them, on every
   intimation or remembrance, to search into their state and condition,
   and to redress what they find amiss: for suppose they should be in the
   right, and blameless as to those orders and constitutions wherein
   others dissent from them, yet there may be such defects and declensions
   in doctrine, holiness, and the fruits of them in the world, as the most
   strict observation of outward order will neither countenance nor
   compensate. For to think to preserve a church by outward order, when
   its internal principles of faith and holiness are decayed, is but to do
   like him who, endeavouring to set a dead boy upright, but failing in
   his attempt, concluded that there was somewhat wanting within.

   2. Another principle of the same importance, and applied unto the same
   purpose, is, that the people are neither able nor fit to judge for
   themselves, but ought in all things to give themselves up unto the
   conduct of their guides, and to rest satisfied in what they purpose and
   prescribe unto them. The imbibing of this apprehension, which is
   exceedingly well suited to be made a covering to the pride and
   ignorance of those unto whose interests it is accommodated, makes them
   impatient of hearing anything concerning the liberty of Christians in
   common to judge of what is their duty, what they are to do, and what
   they are not to do, in things sacred and religious. Only, it is
   acknowledged there is so much ingenuity in the management of this
   principle and its application, that it is seldom extended by any beyond
   their own concernments: For whereas the church of Rome hath no way to
   maintain itself, in its doctrine and essential parts of its
   constitution, but by an implicit faith and obedience in its subjects,
   seeing the animating principles of its profession will endure no kind
   of impartial test or trial, they extend it unto all things, as well in
   matters of faith as of worship and discipline: but those who are secure
   that the faith which they profess will endure an examination by the
   Scripture, as being founded therein and thence educed, they will allow
   unto the people at least a judgment of discerning truth from falsehood,
   to be exercised about the doctrines which they teach; but as for the
   things which concern the worship of God and rule of the church wherein
   they have an especial interest and concern, there they betake
   themselves for relief unto this principle. Now, as there is more
   honesty and safety in this latter way than in the former, so it cannot
   be denied but that there is less of ingenuity and self-consistency; for
   if you will allow the people to make a judgment in and about anything
   that is sacred or religious, you will never know how to hit a joint
   aright to make a separation among such things, so as to say, with any
   pretence of reason, "About these things they may judge for themselves,
   but not about those." And it is a little too open to say that they may
   exercise a judgment about what God hath appointed, but none about what
   we appoint ourselves. But, without offence be it spoken, this
   apprehension, in its whole latitude, and under its restrictions, is so
   weak and ridiculous, that it must be thought to proceed from an excess
   of prejudice, if any man of learning should undertake to patronize it.
   Those who speak in these things out of custom and interest, without a
   due examination of the grounds and reasons of what they affirm or deny,
   as many do, are of no consideration; and it is not amiss for them to
   keep their distance and stand upon their guard, lest many of those whom
   they exclude from judging for themselves should be found more competent
   judges in those matters than themselves. And let churches and church
   rulers do what they please, every man at last will be determined in
   what is meet for him to do by his own reason and judgment. Churches may
   inform the minds of men; they cannot enforce them. And if those that
   adhere unto any church do not do so, because they judge that it is
   their duty, and best for them so to do, they therein differ not much
   from a herd of creatures that are called by another name. And yet a
   secret apprehension in some, that the disposal of the concernments of
   the worship of God is so left and confined unto themselves as that
   nothing is left unto the people but the glory of obedience, without any
   sedulous inquiry after what is their own duty with respect unto that
   account which every one must give of himself unto God, doth greatly
   influence them into the neglect insisted on. And when any of the people
   come to know their own liberty and duty in these things, as they cannot
   but know it if at all they apply their minds unto the consideration of
   them, they are ready to be alienated from those who will neither permit
   them to judge for themselves nor are able to answer for them if they
   should be misled; for "if the blind lead the blind," as well he that is
   led as he that leads "will fall into the ditch."

   3. Add hereunto the thoughts of some, that secular grandeur and outward
   pomp, with a distance and reservedness from the conversation of
   ordinary men, are necessary in ecclesiastics, to raise and preserve
   that popular veneration which they suppose to be their due. Without
   this, it is thought, government will not be carried on, nor the minds
   of men awed unto obedience. Certain it is that this was not the
   judgment of the apostles of old, nor of the bishops or pastors of the
   primitive churches. It is certain, also, that no direction is given for
   it in any of the sacred or ancient ecclesiastical writings; and yet
   they all of them abound with instructions how the guides of the church
   should preserve that respect which is their due. The sum of what they
   teach us to this purpose is, that in humility, patience, self-denial,
   readiness to take up the cross, in labours, kindness, compassion, and
   zeal in the exercise of all the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit,
   they should excel and go before the flock as their example, 1 Pet. v.
   1-3; Acts xx. 18-21, 28, 31. This way of procuring veneration unto
   church guides, by worldly state, greatness, seeming domination or
   power, was, as far as we can find, an utter stranger unto the primitive
   times; yea, not only so, but it seems to be expressly prohibited in
   that direction of our Saviour unto them for avoiding conformity in
   these things unto the rulers of the world, Luke xxii. 24-26. "But those
   times," they say, "are past and gone; there remains not that piety and
   devotion in Christians, as to reverence their pastors for their
   humility, graces, labours, and gifts. The good things of this world are
   now given them to be used; and it is but a popular levelling spirit
   that envies the dignities and exaltation of the clergy." Be it so,
   therefore, that in any place they are justly and usefully, at least as
   unto themselves, possessed of dignities and revenues, and far be it
   from us or any of us to envy them their enjoyments, or to endeavour
   their deprivation of them; but we must crave leave to say, that the use
   of them to the end mentioned is vain and wholly frustrate. And if it be
   so, indeed, that Christians, or professors of the gospel, will not pay
   the respect and duty which they owe unto their pastors and guides, upon
   the account of their office, with their work and labour therein, it is
   an open evidence how great a necessity there is for all men to
   endeavour the reduction of primitive light, truth, holiness, and
   obedience into churches; for this is that which hath endangered their
   ruin, and will effect it if continued, -- namely, an accommodation of
   church order and discipline, with the state and deportment of rulers,
   unto the decays and irreligion of the people, which should have been
   corrected and removed by their reformation. But we hope better things
   of many Christians; whose faith and obedience are rather to be imitated
   than the corrupt degeneracy of others to be complied with or provided
   for. However, it is evident that this corrupt persuasion hath in most
   ages, since the days of Paulus Samosatenus, let out and given
   countenance unto the pride, covetousness, ambition, and vain-glory of
   several ecclesiastics; for how can it be otherwise with them, who,
   being possessed of the secular advantages which some churches have
   obtained in the world, are otherwise utterly destitute of those
   qualifications which the names of the places they possess do require?
   And yet all this while it will be impossible to give one single
   instance where that respect and estimation which the Scripture requires
   in the people towards their spiritual guides were ingenerated or
   improved by that worldly grandeur, pomp, and domination, which some
   pretend to be so useful unto that end and purpose; for that awe which
   is put thereby on the spirits of the common sort of men, -- that terror
   which these things strike into the minds of any who may be obnoxious
   unto trouble and disadvantage from them, -- that outward observance
   which is by some done unto persons vested with them, with the admission
   which they have thereby into an equality of society with great men in
   the world, -- are things quite of another nature. And those who satisfy
   and please themselves herewith, instead of that regard which is due
   unto the officers or guides of the churches of Christ from the people
   that belong unto them, do but help on their defection from their duty
   incumbent on them. Neither were it difficult to manifest what
   innumerable scandalous offences, -- proceeding from the pride and
   elation of mind that is found among many, who, being perhaps young and
   ignorant, it may be corrupt in their conversations, have nothing to
   bear up themselves withal but an interest in dignities and worldly
   riches, -- have been occasioned by this corrupt persuasion. And it is
   not hard to judge how much is lost hereby from the true glory and
   beauty of the church. The people are quietly suffered to decay in that
   love and respect towards their pastors which is their grace and duty,
   whilst they will pay that outward veneration which worldly grandeur
   doth acquire; and pastors, satisfying themselves therewith, grow
   neglective of that exemplary humility and holiness, of that laborious
   diligence in the dispensation of the word and care for the souls of the
   flock, which should procure them that holy respect which is due unto
   their office by the appointment of Jesus Christ. But these things are
   here mentioned only on the occasion of what was before discoursed of.

   Another great occasion of schisms and divisions among Christians
   ariseth from the remainders of that confusion which was brought upon
   the churches of Europe, by that general apostasy from gospel truth,
   purity, and order, wherein they were for sundry ages involved. Few
   churches in the world have yet totally freed themselves from being
   influenced by the relics of its disorders. That such an apostasy did
   befall these churches we shall not need to prove. A supposition of it
   is the foundation of the church-state of England. That things should so
   fall out among them was of old foretold by the Holy Ghost, 2 Thess. ii.
   That many churches have received a signal deliverance from the
   principal evils of that apostasy, in the Reformation, we all
   acknowledge; for therein, by several ways, and in several degrees of
   success, a return unto their pristine faith and order was sincerely
   endeavoured. And so far was there a blessing accompanying of their
   endeavours, as that they were all of them delivered from things in
   themselves pernicious and destructive to the souls of men.
   Nevertheless, it cannot be denied but that there do yet continue among
   them sundry remainders of those disorders, which under their fatal
   declension they were cast into. Nor doth there need any farther proof
   hereof than the incurable differences and divisions that are found
   among them; for had they attained their primitive condition, such
   divisions with all their causes had been prevented. And the Papists,
   upbraiding Protestants with their intestine differences and schisms, do
   but reproach them that they have not been able in a hundred years to
   rectify all those abuses and remove all those disorders which they were
   inventing and did introduce in a thousand. There is one thing only of
   this nature, or that owes itself unto this original, which we shall
   instance in, as an occasion of much disorder in the present churches,
   and of great divisions that ensue thereon. It is known none were
   admitted unto the fellowship of the church in the days of the apostles
   but upon their repentance, faith, and turning unto God. The plain story
   of their preaching, the success which they had therein, and their
   proceedings to gather and plant churches thereon, put this out of the
   reach of all sober contradiction. None will say that they gathered
   churches of Jews and Gentiles, -- that is, while they continued such;
   nor of open sinners continuing to live in their sins. An evidence,
   therefore, and confession of conversion to God, were unavoidably
   necessary to the admission of members in the first churches; neither
   will we ever contend with such importune prejudices as, under any
   pretences capable of a wrangling countenance, shall set up against this
   evidence. Hence, in the judgment of charity, all the members of those
   churches were looked on as persons really justified and sanctified, --
   as effectually converted unto God; and as such were they saluted and
   treated by the apostles. As such, we say, they were looked on and
   owned; and as such, upon their confession, it was the duty of all men,
   even the apostles themselves, to look on them and own them, though
   absolutely in the sight of God, who alone is "searcher of the hearts of
   men," some among them were hypocrites, and some proved apostates. But
   this profession of conversion unto God by the ministry of the word, and
   the mutual acknowledgment of each other as so converted unto God, in a
   way of duty, was the foundation of holy, spiritual love and unity among
   them. And although this did not, nor could, preserve all the first
   churches absolutely free from schisms and divisions, yet was it the
   most sovereign antidote against that infection, and the most effectual
   means for the reduction of unity, after that, by the violent
   interposition of men's corruptions and temptations, it had been lost
   for a season. Afterward, in the primitive times, when many more took on
   them the profession of Christian religion, who had not such eminent and
   visible conversions unto God as most of those had who were changed by
   the ministry of the apostles, that persons unfit and unqualified for
   that state and condition, of being members of churches, might not be
   admitted into them, unto the disturbance of their order and
   disreputation of their holy conversation, they were for some good
   season kept in the condition of expectants, and called catechumens, or
   persons that attended the church for instruction. In this state they
   were taught the mysteries of religion, and trial was made of their
   faith, holiness, and constancy before their admission; and by this
   means was the preservation of the churches in purity, peace, and order,
   provided for. Especially were they so in conjunction with that severe
   discipline which was then exercised towards all the members of them.
   But after that the multitudes of the Gentile world, in the times of the
   first Christian emperors, pressed into the church, and were admitted on
   much easier terms than those before mentioned, whole nations came to
   claim successively the privilege of church-membership, without any
   personal duty performed or profession made unto the purpose on their
   part. And so do they continue to do in many places to this day. Men
   generally trouble themselves no farther about a title to church
   membership and privileges, but rest in the prepossession of their
   ancestors, and their own nativity in such or such places; for whatever
   may be owned or acknowledged concerning the necessity of a visible
   profession of faith and repentance, and that credible as to the
   sincerity of it, in the judgment of charity, it is certain for the most
   part no such thing is required of any, nor performed by them. And they
   do but ill consult for the edification of the church, or the good of
   the souls of men, who would teach them to rest in an outward, formal
   representation of things, instead of the reality of duties and the
   power of internal grace. And no small part of the present ruin of
   Christian religion owes itself unto this corrupt principle; for whereas
   the things of it, -- which consist in powers internal and effectual
   operations of grace, -- have outward representations of them, which,
   from their relation unto what they represent, are called by the same
   names with them, many take up with and rest in these external things,
   as though Christianity consisted in them, although they are but a dead
   carcase, where the quickening life and soul of internal grace is
   wanting. Thus it is in this matter, where there is a shadow and
   appearance of church-order, when the truth and substance of it is far
   away. Men come together unto all the ends of the church assemblies
   whereunto they are admitted, but on no other grounds, with no other
   hearts nor designs, but on and with what they partake in any civil
   society, or jointly engage in any other worldly concern. And this
   fundamental error in the constitution of many churches is the occasion,
   as of other evils, so in particular of divisions among professed
   Christians. Hence, originally, was the discipline of the church
   accommodated, by various degrees, to the rule and government of such
   persons as understood little, or were little sensible, of the nature,
   power, and efficacy of that spiritual discipline which is instituted in
   the gospel; which thereby at last degenerated into the outward way of
   force and power before described: for the churches began to be composed
   of such as could no otherwise be ruled, and instead of reducing them to
   their primitive temper and condition, whereunto the evangelical rule
   was suited, there was invented a way of government accommodate unto
   that state whereinto they were lapsed; which those concerned found to
   be the far easier work of the two. Hence did sincere mutual love, with
   all the fruits of it, begin to decay among church members, seeing they
   could not have that tolerable persuasion of that truth or profession in
   each other which is necessary to preserve it without dissimulation, and
   to provoke it unto a due exercise. Hence did private spiritual
   communion fail amongst them, the most being strangers unto all the ways
   and means of it, yea, despising and contemning it in all the instances
   of its exercise; which will yet be found to be as the life and soul of
   all useful church-communion. And where the public communion is only
   attended unto, with neglect hereof, it will quickly wither and come to
   nothing; for on this occasion do all duties of watchfulness,
   exhortations, and admonitions, proceeding from mutual love and care of
   each other's condition, so frequently recommended unto us in the
   Scripture, utterly cease and become disused. Hence members of the same
   church began to converse together as men only, or at the best, civil
   neighbours; and if at all as Christians, yet not with respect unto that
   especial relation unto a particular church wherein their usefulness as
   members of the same organical body is required, 1 Cor. xii. 14-21.
   Hence some persons, looking on these things as intolerable, and not
   only obstructive of their edification, but destructive unto all really
   useful church-communion, we ought not to wonder if they have thought
   meet to provide otherwise for themselves. Not that we approve of every
   departure or withdrawing from the communion of churches where things
   continue under such disorders, but only show what it is that
   occasioneth many so to do; for as there may sometimes be just cause
   hereof, and persons in so doing may manage what they do according unto
   Scripture rule, so we doubt not but that some may rashly and
   precipitately, without due attendance unto all the duties which in such
   undertakings are required of them, without that charity and forbearance
   which no circumstances can absolve them from, make themselves guilty of
   a blamable separation. And these are some of those things which we look
   upon as the general causes or occasions of all the schisms and
   divisions that are at this day found among professors of the gospel.
   Whether the guilt of them will not much cleave unto them by whom they
   are kept on foot and maintained is worth their inquiry; for so doth it
   befall our human nature, apt to be deceived and imposed on by various
   pretences and prejudices, that those are oftentimes highly guilty
   themselves of those miscarriages, whose chiefest satisfaction and glory
   consist in charging them on others. However, if these things do not
   absolutely justify any in a secession from the churches whereunto they
   did relate, yet they render the matter so highly questionable, and the
   things themselves are so burdensome upon the minds of many, as that
   divisions will thereon undoubtedly ensue. And when it is so fallen out,
   to design and contrive the reduction of all unto outward unity and
   concord, by forcing them who on such occasions have dissented and
   withdrawn themselves from the communion of any church, without
   endeavouring the removal of those occasions of their so doing and the
   reformation of those abuses which have given cause thereunto, is
   severe, if not unjust. But when the Lord Jesus Christ, in his care
   towards his churches, and watchfulness over them, shall be pleased to
   remove these and the like stumbling-blocks out of the way, there will,
   we hope, be a full return unto gospel unity and peace among them that
   serve and worship him on the earth.

   In this state of things, wherever it be found, it is no wonder if the
   weaknesses, ignorance, prejudices, and temptations of men do interpose
   themselves unto the increase and heightening of those divisions whose
   springs and occasions lie elsewhere. When none of these provocations
   were given them, yet we know there was enough in professors themselves
   to bring forth the bitter fruit of differences and schisms, even in the
   days of the apostles, 1 Cor. i. 11, iii. 3. How much more may we fear
   the like fruits and effects from the like principles and corrupt
   affections! Now the occasions of drawing them forth are more,
   temptations unto them greater, directions against them less evident and
   powerful, and all sense of ecclesiastical authority, through its abuse
   and maladministration, is, if not lost and ruined, yet much weakened
   and impaired. But from the darkness of the minds of men and their
   unmortified affections (as the best know but in part, nor are they
   perfectly sanctified) it is that they are apt to take offence one at
   another, and thereon to judge and censure each other temerariously;
   and, which is worst of all, every one to make his own understanding and
   persuasion thereon the rule of truth and worship unto others. All such
   ways and courses are against us in the matter of love and union, all
   tending to make and increase divisions among us: and the evil that is
   in them we might here declare, but that it falls frequently under the
   chastisement of other hands; neither, indeed, can it well meet with too
   much severity of reproof. Only, it were desirable that those by whom
   such reproofs are managed would take care not to give advantages of
   retortion or self-justification unto them that are reproved by them;
   but this they do unavoidably, whilst they seem to make their own
   judgments and practices the sole rule and measure of what they approve
   or disallow. In what complies with them there is nothing perverse; and
   in what differs from them there is nothing sincere! And on this
   foundation, whilst they reprove censuring, rash-judging, and
   reproaching of others, with pride, self-conceitedness, false opinions,
   irregular practices in church-worship, or any other concerns of
   religion, backbiting, easiness in taking up false reports, with the
   like evils, as they deserve severely to be rebuked, those reproved by
   them are apt to think that they see the guilt of many of the crimes
   charged on themselves in them by whom they are reproved. So on all
   hands things gender unto farther strife; whilst every party, being
   conscious unto their own sincerity, according unto the rule of their
   present light, which is the only measure they can take of it, are ready
   to impeach the sincerity of them by whom they suppose themselves
   causelessly traduced and condemned. This evil, therefore, is to be
   diligently watched against by all that love unity, truth, holiness, or
   peace; and seeing there are rules and precepts given us in the
   Scriptures to this purpose, it may not be unmeet to call over some of
   them.

   [First,] One rule of this nature and import is, that we should all of
   us "study to be quiet, and to do our own business," in things civil and
   sacred, 1 Thess. iv. 11. Who will harm men, who will be offended with
   them, whilst they are no otherwise busied in the world? And if any
   attempt to do them evil, what need have they to be troubled thereat?
   Duty and innocency will give peace to a worthy soul in the midst of all
   storms, and whatever may befall it. Now, will any one deny, or can
   they, but that it is the duty and ought to be the business of every man
   to seek his own edification and the saving of his soul? Deny this unto
   any man, and you put yourself in the place of God to him, and make him
   more miserable than a beast. And this, which no man can forbid, no man
   can otherwise do than according to that light and knowledge of the will
   of God which he hath received. If this, therefore, be so attended to as
   that we do not thereby break in upon the concerns of others, nor
   disturb them in what is theirs, but be carried on quietly and
   peaceably, with an evidence in what we do that it is merely our own
   personal duty that we are in the pursuance of, all cause of offence
   will be taken away; for if any will yet be offended with men because
   they peaceably seek the salvation of their own souls, or do that in
   order thereunto which they cannot but do, unless they will cast off all
   sense of God's authority over them, it is to seek occasions of offence
   against them where none are given. But when any persons are acted by a
   pragmatical curiosity to interpose themselves in the ways, affairs, and
   concerns of other men, beyond what the laws of love, usefulness, and
   mutual Christian aid do require, tumults, disorders, vexations, strife,
   emulations, with a world of evils, will ensue thereon; -- especially
   will they do so when men are prone to dwell on the real or supposed
   faults of others, which, on various pretences of pity for their
   persons, or a detestation of their evils, or public reproof of them,
   they will aggravate, and so on all occasions expose them to public
   censure, perhaps, as they think, out of zeal to God's glory and a
   desire for the church's good; for the passions and interests of such
   persons are ready to swell over the bounds of modesty, sobriety, and
   peace, though, through the blindness which all self-love is accompanied
   withal, they seldom see clearly what they do. Would we, therefore,
   labour to see a beauty, desirableness, and honour in the greatest
   confinement of our thoughts, words, and actions, unto ourselves and our
   own occasions, that express duty will admit of, it might tend very much
   to the preservation of love and peace among professors, for unto this
   end it is prescribed unto us.

   Secondly, It is strictly commanded us that we should "not judge, that
   we be not judged," Matt. vii. 1, 2. There is no rule for mutual
   conversation and communion in the Scripture that is oftener repeated or
   more earnestly inculcated, Luke vi. 37; nor is there any of more use,
   nor whose grounds and reasons are more evident or more cogent, Rom.
   xiv. 3, 4, 10. Judging and determining in ourselves, or divulging
   censures concerning others, their persons, states, and conditions
   towards God, their principles as to truth and sincerity, their ways as
   to righteousness and holiness, whether past or present, any otherwise
   than by the "perfect law of liberty," and that only when we are called
   thereunto in a way of duty, is the poison of common love and peace, and
   the ruin of all communion and society, be it of what nature it will.
   For us to judge and determine whether these or those churches are true
   churches or no, whether such persons are godly or no, whether such of
   their principles and actions are regular or no, and so condemn them in
   our minds (unless where open wickedness will justify the severest
   reflections), is to speak evil of the law, and to make ourselves judges
   of it as well as of them who, together with ourselves, are to be judged
   by it, James iv. 11, 12. Nor is a judgment of that nature necessary
   unto our advantage in the discharge of any duty required at our hands.
   We may order all our concernments towards churches and persons without
   making any such judgment concerning them. But so strong is the
   inclination of some persons unto an excess in this kind, that no
   consideration can prevail with them to cast it out, according to its
   desert. Whether they do it as approving and justifying themselves in
   what they condemn in others, or as a thing conducing unto their
   interests, or out of faction and an especial love to some one party of
   men, or some secret animosities and hatred against others, it is a
   matter they seldom will quit themselves of whilst they are in this
   world. Yea, so far do some suffer themselves to be transported, as that
   they cannot restrain from charging of others with the guilt of such
   things as they know to be charged on themselves by them who pretend to
   be the only competent judges in such cases; and so will they also
   reflect upon and complain of other men for miscarriages by severities,
   in instances exceedingly inferior, as by themselves represented, unto
   what it is known they were engaged in. But men are apt to think well of
   all they do themselves or those whom they peculiarly regard, and to
   aggravate whatever they conceive amiss in such as they dislike. Were it
   not better by love to cover a multitude of faults, and to leave the
   judgment of persons and things, wherein we are not concerned, unto "Him
   who judgeth righteously, and will render unto every man according to
   his works?" However, certain it is that until this evil fountain of
   bitter waters be stopped, until we cease to bless God, even the Father,
   and at the same time to curse men made after the similitude of God, the
   wounds that have been given to the love and peace of professors will
   not be healed.

   Thirdly, Unto the same end are all men forbidden to think that they
   have a dominion over the faith of others, or that the ordering and
   disposal of it is committed unto them. It is Christ alone who is the
   Lord of the consciences of his disciples; and therefore the best and
   greatest of the sons of men who have been appointed by him to deal with
   others in his name, have constantly disclaimed all thoughts of power or
   rule over the consciences or faith of the meanest of his subjects, 2
   Cor. i. 24; 1 Pet. v. 3. How many ways this may be done we are filled
   with experiences; for no way whereby it may be so hath been left
   unattempted. And the evil of it hath invaded both churches and
   particular persons; some whereof, who have been active in casting off
   the dominion of others, seemed to have designed a possession of it in
   themselves. And it is well if, where one pope is rejected, many do not
   rise in his place, who want nothing but his power and interest to do
   his work. The indignation of some, that others do not in all things
   comply with their sentiments and subject themselves unto their
   apprehensions and dictates, ariseth from this presumption; and the
   persecutions wherein others engage do all grow out of the same bitter
   root: for men can no otherwise satisfy their consciences herein but by
   a supposition that they are warranted to give measures unto the minds
   and practices of others, -- that is, their faith and consciences, -- in
   sacred things. And whilst this presumptuous supposition, under any
   pretence or colour, possesseth the minds of men, it will variously act
   itself unto the destruction of that gospel unity which it is our duty
   to preserve; for when they are persuaded that others ought to give up
   themselves absolutely to their guidance in the things of religion,
   either because of their office and dignity, or because they are wiser
   than they, or it may be are only able to dispute more than they, if
   they do not immediately so do, especially seeing they cannot but judge
   themselves in the right in all things, they are ready to charge their
   refusal on all the corrupt affections, principles, and practices which
   they can surmise, or their supposed just indignation suggest unto them.
   That they are proud, ignorant, self-conceited, wilful, factious, is
   immediately concluded; and a semblance unto such charges shall be
   diligently sought out and improved. Nothing but a deceiving
   apprehension that they are some way or other meet to have a dominion
   over the faith of their brethren and fellow-servants would prevail with
   men otherwise sober and learned so to deal with all that dissent from
   them as they are pleased to do.

   Fourthly, All these evils mentioned are much increased in the minds of
   men when they are puffed up with a conceit of their own knowledge and
   wisdom, Rom. xii. 3; 1 Cor. viii. 1. This, therefore, we are warned to
   avoid, that the edification of the church may be promoted and love
   preserved; for hence are very many apt to take false measures of
   things, especially of themselves, and thereon to cast themselves into
   many mischievous mistakes, 2 Cor. x. 12. And this is apt to befall them
   who, for ends best known unto themselves, have with any ordinary
   diligence attended to the study of learning; for on a supposal of some
   competent furniture, with natural abilities, they cannot but attain
   some skill and knowledge that the common sort of unstudied persons are
   unacquainted withal; -- ofttimes, indeed, their pre-eminence in this
   kind consists in matters of very small consequence or importance. But
   whatever it be, it is ready to make them think strange of the apostle's
   advice: "If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him
   become a fool, that he may be wise," 1 Cor. iii. 18. Apt it is to puff
   them up, to influence their minds with a good conceit of themselves,
   and a contempt of others. Hence may we see some, when they have got a
   little skill in languages, and through custom, advantaged by the
   reading of some books, are able readily to express some thoughts,
   perhaps not originally their own, presently conceit themselves to be so
   much wiser than the multitude of unlettered persons, that they are
   altogether impatient that in any thing they should dissent from them;
   and this is a common frame with them whose learning and wit being their
   all, do yet but reach half way towards the useful ends of such things.
   Others also there are, and of them not a few, who having been in the
   ways wherein the skill and knowledge mentioned are usually attained,
   yet through their incapacity or negligence, or some depraved habit of
   mind or course of life, have not really at all improved in them; and
   yet these also, having once attained the countenance of ecclesiastical
   offices or preferments, are as forward as any to declaim against and
   pretend a contempt of that ignorance in others which they are not so
   stupid as not to know that the guilt of it may be reflected on
   themselves. However, these things at best, and in their highest
   improvement, are far enough from solid wisdom, especially that which is
   from above, and which alone will promote the peace and edification of
   the church. Some have no advantage by them but that they can declare
   and speak out their own weakness; others, that they can rail, and lie,
   and falsely accuse, in words and language wherewith they hope to please
   the vilest of men. And certain it is that science, -- which whatever it
   be, without the grace of God, is but falsely so called, and oftentimes
   falsely pretended unto, for this evil end of it alone, -- is apt to
   lift up the minds of men above others, who perhaps come not behind them
   in any useful understanding. Yea, suppose men to have really attained a
   singular degree in useful knowledge and wisdom, and that either in
   things spiritual and divine, or in learning and sciences, or in
   political prudence, yet experience shows us that a hurtful elation of
   mind is apt to arise from them, if the souls of men be not well
   balanced with humility, and this evil particularly watched against.
   Hence ariseth that impatience of contradiction, that jealousy and
   tenderness of men's own names and reputations, those sharp revenges
   they are ready to take of any supposed inroads upon them or disrespects
   towards them, that contempt and undervaluation of other men's
   judgments, those magisterial impositions and censures, which proceed
   from men under a reputation of these endowments. The cautions given us
   in the Scripture against this frame of spirit, the examples that are
   proposed unto us to the contrary (even that of Christ himself), the
   commands that are multiplied for lowliness of mind, jealousy over
   ourselves, the sovereignty of God in choosing whom he pleaseth to
   reveal his mind and truth unto and by, may, in the consideration of
   them, be useful to prevent such surprisals with pride, self-conceit,
   and contempt of others, as supposed or abused knowledge is apt to cast
   men into, whereby divisions are greatly fomented and increased among
   us. But it may be these things will not much prevail with them who,
   pretending a zeal and principle above others in preaching and urging
   the example of Christ, do in most of their ways and actings, and in
   some of their writings, give us an unparalleled representation of the
   devil.

   Lastly, It is confessed by all, that false teachers, seducers,
   broachers of novel, corrupt, and heretical doctrines, have caused many
   breaches and divisions among such as once agreed in the profession of
   the same truths and points of faith. By means of such persons, whether
   within the present church-state or without, there is scarce any sacred
   truth, which had formerly secured its station and possession in the
   minds of the generality of Christians in this nation, but what hath
   been solicited or opposed. Some make their errors the principal
   foundation, rule, and measure in communion; whoever complies with them
   therein is of them, and whoso doth not they avoid: so at once they shut
   up themselves from having any thing to do with them that love truth and
   peace. And where these consequents do not ensue, men's zeal for their
   errors being overbalanced by their love of and concern in their secular
   interest, and their minds influenced by the novel prevailing opinion of
   a great indifferency in all things appertaining unto outward worship,
   yet the advancing and fomenting of opinions contrary unto that sound
   doctrine which hath been generally owned and taught by the learned and
   godly pastors, and received by the people themselves, cannot but
   occasion strife, contentions, and divisions among professors. And it
   may be there are very few of those articles or heads of religion which
   in the beginning of the Reformation, and a long time after, were looked
   on as the most useful, important, and necessary parts of our
   profession, that have not been among us variously opposed and
   corrupted. And in these differences about doctrine lie the hidden
   causes of the animosities whereby those about worship and discipline
   are managed; for those who have the advantage of law and power on their
   side in these lesser things are not so unwise as to deal openly with
   their adversaries about those things wherein the reputation of
   established and commonly-received doctrines lie against them; but under
   the pretence and shelter of contending for legal appointments, not a
   few do exercise an enmity against those who profess the truth, which
   they think it not meet as yet openly to oppose.

   Such are the causes and such are the occasions of the differences and
   divisions in and about religious concerns that are among us, by which
   means they have been fomented and increased: heightened they have been
   by the personal faults and miscarriages of many of all sorts and
   parties. And as the reproof of their sinful failings is in its proper
   season a necessary duty, so no reformation or amendment of persons will
   give a full relief, nor free us from the evil of our divisions, until
   the principles and ways which occasion them be taken out of the way.

Chapter V.

   Grounds and reasons of nonconformity.

   Having briefly declared our sense concerning the general causes and
   occasions of our differences, and that present want of Christian love
   which is complained of by many, we shall now return to give some more
   particular account concerning our inconformity unto and non-compliance
   with the observances and constitutions of the church of England. It is
   acknowledged, that we do in sundry things dissent from them; that we do
   not, that we cannot, come up unto a joint practice with others in them.
   It is also confessed, that hereon there doth ensue an appearance of
   schism between them and us, according as the common notion of it is
   received in the world. And because in this distance and difference the
   dissent unto compliance is on our parts, there is a semblance of a
   voluntary relinquishment of their communion; and this we know exposeth
   us, in vulgar judgments and apprehensions, unto the charge of schism,
   and necessitateth us unto self-defence, as though the only matter in
   question were, whether we are guilty of this evil or no. For that
   advantage have all churches which have had an opportunity to fix terms
   of communion, right or wrong, just or unequal, -- the differences which
   ensue thereon, they will try out on no other terms, but only whether
   those that dissent from them are schismatics or not. Thus they make
   themselves actors ofttimes in this cause who ought in the first place
   to be charged with injury; and a trial is made merely at the hazard of
   the reputation of those who are causelessly put upon their purgation
   and defence. Yea, with many, a kind of possession and multitude do
   render dissenters unquestionably schismatical; so that it is esteemed
   an unreasonable confidence in them to deny themselves so to be. So
   deals the church of Rome with those that are reformed. An open schism
   there is between them; and if they cannot sufficiently fix the guilt of
   it on the reformed by confidence and clamours, with the advantage of
   prepossession, yet, as if they were perfectly innocent themselves, they
   will allow of no other inquiry in this matter but what consists in
   calling the truth and reputation of the other party into question. It
   being our present condition to lie under this charge from many, whose
   interest it is to have us thought guilty thereof, we do deny that there
   is any culpable secession made by us from the communion of any that
   profess the gospel in these nations, or that the blame of the appearing
   schism that is among us can duly or justly be reflected on us; which,
   in the remainder of our discourse, we shall make to appear.

   What are our thoughts and judgments concerning the church state and
   interest of the professors of the gospel in this nation, we have before
   declared; and we hope they are such that, in the judgment of persons
   sober and impartial, we shall be relieved from those clamorous
   accusations which are without number or measure by some cast upon us.
   Our prayers are also continually unto the God of love and peace, for
   the taking away of all divisions and their causes from among us. Nor is
   the satisfaction which ariseth from our sincerity herein in the least
   taken off or rent from us by the uncharitable endeavours of some to
   rake up pretences to the contrary. And should those in whose power it
   is think meet to imitate the pastors and guides of the churches of old,
   and to follow them in any of the ways which they used for the
   restoration of unity and agreement unto Christians, when lost or
   endangered, we should not decline the contribution of any assistance,
   by counsel or fraternal compliance, which God should be pleased to
   supply us withal. But whilst some, whose advantages render them
   considerable in these matters, seem to entertain no other thoughts
   concerning us but what issue in violence and oppression, the principal
   duty incumbent on us is quietly to approve our consciences unto God,
   that in sincerity of heart we desire in all things to please him, and
   to conform our lives, principles, and practices to his will, so far as
   he is graciously pleased to make it known unto us. And as for men, we
   hope so to discharge the duty required of us as that none may justly
   charge us with any disorders, unpeaceableness, or other evils; for we
   do not apprehend that we are either the cause or culpable occasion of
   those inconveniences and troubles which some have put themselves unto
   by their endeavours for our disturbance, impoverishing, and ruin. Let
   none imagine but that we have considered the evils and evil consequents
   of the schisms and divisions that are among us; and those who do so, do
   it upon the forfeiture of their charity. We know how much the great
   work of preaching the gospel, unto the conversion of the souls of men,
   is impeded thereby; as also what prejudice ariseth thence against the
   truth wherein we are all agreed, with what temptations and mutual
   exasperations, to the loss of love, and the occasioning of many sinful
   miscarriages in persons of all sorts, do hereon ensue: but we deny that
   it is in our power to remove them, or take them out of the way; -- nor
   are we conscious unto ourselves of any sin or evil, in what we do, or
   in what we do not do, by our not doing of it in the worship of God. It
   is duty alone unto Jesus Christ whereunto in these things we attend,
   and wherein we ought so to do. And where matters of this nature are so
   circumstanced as that duty will contribute nothing towards unity, we
   are at a loss for any progress towards it. The sum of what is objected
   unto us (as hath been observed) is our nonconformity, or our
   forbearance of actual personal communion with the present church
   constitutions, in the modes, rites, and ceremonies of its worship:
   hence the schism complained of doth ensue. Unless the communion be
   total, constant, without endeavour of any alteration or reformation, we
   cannot, in the judgment of some, be freed from the guilt hereof. This
   we deny, and are persuaded that it is to be charged elsewhere; for, --

   First, All the conditions of absolute and complete communion with the
   church of England, which are proposed unto us, and indispensably
   required of us, especially as we are ministers, are unscriptural, --
   such as the word of God doth neither warrant, mention, nor intimate,
   especially not under any such consideration as necessary conditions of
   communion in or among the churches of Christ. We dispute not now about
   the lawfulness or unlawfulness of things in themselves, nor whether
   they may be observed or no by such as have no conviction of any sin or
   evil in them; neither do we judge or censure them by whom they are
   observed. Our inquiry is solely about our own liberty and duty. And
   what concerneth them is resolved into this one question, as to the
   argument in hand: Whether such things or observances in the worship of
   God as are wholly unscriptural may be so made the indispensable
   condition of communion with any particular church, as that they by whom
   they are so made and imposed on others should be justified in their so
   doing; and that if any differences, divisions, or schisms do ensue
   thereon, the guilt and blame of them must necessarily fall on those who
   refuse submission to them or to admit of them as such? That the
   conditions proposed unto us, and imposed on us indispensably, if we
   intend to enjoy the communion of this church, are of this nature, we
   shall afterward prove by an induction of instances. Nor is it of any
   concernment, in this matter, what place the things inquired after do
   hold, or are supposed to hold, in the worship of God; our present
   inquiry is about their warranty to be made conditions of church
   communion. Now, we are persuaded that the Lord Christ hath set his
   disciples at liberty from accepting of such terms of communion from any
   churches in the world. And on the same grounds we deny that he hath
   given or granted unto them authority to constitute such terms and
   conditions of their communion, and indispensably to impose them upon
   all that enjoy it, according to their several capacities and concerns
   therein; for, --

   1. The rule of communion among the disciples of Christ in all his
   churches is invariably established and fixed by himself. His
   commission, direction, and command, given out unto the first planters
   and founders of them, containing an obliging rule unto all that should
   succeed them throughout all generations, hath so established the
   bounds, limits, and conditions of church-communion, as that it is not
   lawful for any to attempt their removal or alteration. "Go ye," saith
   he to them, "and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe
   all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you
   alway, even unto the end of the world," Matt. xxviii. 19, 20. All the
   benefits and blessings, all the comfort and use of church assemblies
   and communion, depend alone on the promise of the presence of Christ
   with them. Thence doth all the authority that may be exercised in them
   proceed, and thence doth the efficacy of what they do unto the
   edification of the souls of men arise and flow. Now, that any one may
   thus enjoy the presence of Christ in any church, with the fruits and
   benefits of it, no more can be required of him but that, through the
   preaching of the gospel and baptism, being made a professed disciple,
   he do or be ready to do and observe all whatsoever Christ hath
   commanded. This hath he established as the rule of communion among his
   disciples and churches in all generations. In all other things which do
   relate unto the worship of God, he hath set them and left them at
   liberty, Gal. v. 1; which, so far as it is a grant and privilege
   purchased for them, they are obliged to make good and maintain. We know
   it will be here replied, that among the commands of Christ it is that
   we should "hear the church," and obey the guides and rulers thereof;
   whatever, therefore, is appointed by them, we are to submit unto and
   observe, even by virtue of the command of Christ. And, indeed, it is
   certainly true that it is the will and command of the Lord Jesus that
   we should both hear the church and obey the guides of it; -- but, by
   virtue of this rule, neither the church nor its guides can make any
   thing necessary to the disciples of Christ, as a condition of communion
   with them, but only what he hath commanded; for the rule here laid down
   is given unto those guides or rulers, who are thereby bound up, in the
   appointments of what the disciples are to observe, unto the commands of
   Christ. And were a command included herein of obeying the commands or
   appointments of church guides, and the promise of the presence of
   Christ annexed thereunto, as he had given them all his own power and
   placed them in his throne, so we had been all obliged to follow them
   whither ever they had carried or led us, although it were to hell
   itself, as some of the canonists, on this principle, have spoken
   concerning the pope. Here, therefore, is a rule of communion fixed,
   both unto them that are to rule in the church and them that are to
   obey. And whereas, perhaps, it may be said, that if the rulers of the
   church may appoint nothing in and unto the communion of the church but
   what Christ hath himself commanded, then, indeed, is their authority
   little worth, yea, upon the matter none at all, for the commands of
   Christ are sufficiently confirmed and fixed by his own authority; and
   to what end, then, serves that of the rulers of the church? -- we must
   say that their whole authority is limited in the text unto teaching of
   men to observe what Christ hath commanded; and this they are to do with
   authority, but under him and in his name, and according to the rules
   that he hath given them. And those who think not this power sufficient
   for them must seek it elsewhere, for the Lord Christ will allow no more
   in his churches.

   To make this yet more evident, we may consider that particular instance
   wherein the primitive Christians had a trial in the case as now stated
   before us; and this was in the matter of Mosaical ceremonies and
   institutions, which some would have imposed on them as a condition of
   their communion in the profession of the gospel. In the determination
   hereof was their liberty asserted by the apostles, and their duty
   declared, to abide therein. And this was the most specious pretence of
   imposing on the liberty of Christians that ever they were exercised
   withal; for the observation of these things had countenance given unto
   it from their divine original, and the condescending practice of the
   apostles for a good season. That other instances of the like nature
   should be condemned in the Scripture is impossible, seeing none had
   then endeavoured the introduction of any of that nature. But a general
   rule may be established in the determination of one case as well as in
   that of many, provided it be not extended beyond what is eminently
   included in that case. Herein, therefore, was there a direction given
   for the duty and practice of churches in following ages, and that in
   pursuit of the law and constitution of the Lord Christ before
   mentioned. Neither is there any force in the exception, that these
   things were imposed under a pretence of being commanded by God himself:
   for they say, to require anything under that notion, which indeed he
   hath not commanded, is an adding to his command, which ought not to be
   admitted; but to require things indifferent without that pretence may
   be allowed. But as in the former way men add unto the commands of God
   formally, so in this latter they do it materially, which also is
   prohibited; for in his worship we are forbidden to add to the things
   that he hath appointed no less than to pretend commands from him which
   he hath not given. He, therefore, who professeth and pleadeth his
   willingness to observe and do in church-communion whatever Christ hath
   instituted and commanded cannot regularly be refused the communion of
   any church, under any pretence of his refusal to do other things which
   confessedly are not so required.

   It is pleaded, indeed, that no other things, as to the substance of the
   worship of God, can or ought to be appointed besides what is instituted
   by Jesus Christ; but as to the manner or modes of the performance of
   what he doth command, with other rites and ceremonies to be observed
   for order and decency, they may lawfully be instituted by the rulers of
   the church. Let it therefore at present be granted that so they may be,
   by them who are persuaded of the lawfulness of those modes, and of the
   things wherein they consist, seeing that is not the question at present
   under agitation; -- neither will this concession help us in our present
   inquiry, unless it be also granted that whatever may be lawfully
   practised in the worship of God may be lawfully made a necessary
   condition of communion in that worship; but this will not be granted,
   nor can it ever be proved. Besides, in our present difference, this is
   only the judgment of one party, that the things mentioned may be
   lawfully observed in and among sacred administrations; and thereon the
   conclusion must be, that whatever some think may be lawfully practised
   in divine worship may lawfully be made an indispensable condition of
   communion unto the whole. Nor will it give force unto this inference,
   that those who judge them lawful are the rulers and guides of the
   church, unto whose determination the judgment of private persons is not
   to be opposed; for we have showed before that a judgment concerning
   what any one is to do or practice in the worship of God belongs unto
   every man who is to do or practice aught therein, and he who makes it
   not is brutish. And the judgment which the rulers of the church are to
   make for the whole, or to go before it, is in what is commanded, or not
   so, by Jesus Christ, not in what is fit to be added thereunto by
   themselves. Besides, if it must be allowed that such things may be made
   the conditions of church-communion, then any who are in places of
   authority may multiply such conditions according unto the utmost extent
   of their judgments, until they become burdensome and intolerable unto
   all, or really ridiculous in themselves; as it is fallen out in the
   church of Rome. But this would prove expressly destructive unto that
   certain and unvariable rule of church-communion which the Lord Christ
   hath fixed and established, whereof we shall speak again afterward.

   Neither will that plea which is by some insisted on in this case yield
   any solid or universal relief. It is said that some may warrantably and
   duly observe in the worship of God what is unduly and unwarrantably
   imposed on them by others. And, indeed, all controversies about church
   constitution, discipline, and external worship, are by some reduced
   unto these two heads: That the magistrate may appoint what he pleaseth,
   and the people may observe whatever he appoints; for as there is no
   government of the church determined in the Scripture, it is meet it
   should be erected and disposed by the supreme magistrate, who, no
   doubt, upon that supposition, is only fit and qualified so to do. And
   for outward worship, and the rites thereof, both it and they are so far
   indifferent as that we may comply with whatever is imposed on us;
   whether they be good and useful, or evil, lies at the doors of others
   to answer about. But this seems to rise up in express contradiction
   unto those commands which are given us to "stand fast in the liberty
   wherewith Christ hath made us free," and in these things not to be "the
   servants of men;" for what do we do less than renounce the privilege of
   our liberty, purchased for us at a high rate and price, or what are we
   less than "servants of men," whilst we bring ourselves in bondage unto
   the observation of such things in the worship of God as we judge
   neither commanded by him nor tending unto our own edification, but
   merely because by them ordained? Moreover, suppose it be the judgment
   of some, as it is of many, that the things mentioned, though in their
   own nature indifferent, do become unlawful unto them to observe when
   imposed as necessary conditions of all church-communion, contrary to
   the command and appointment of Christ. We know this is exceedingly
   declaimed against, as that which is perverse and froward: "For what,"
   say many, "can be more unreasonable than that things in their own
   nature indifferent should become unlawful because they are commanded?"
   But it is at least no less unreasonable that things confessedly
   indifferent should not be left so, but be rendered necessary unto
   practice, though useless in it, by arbitrary commands. But the opinion
   traduced is also much mistaken; for although it be granted that the
   things themselves are indifferent in their own nature, -- not capable,
   but as determined by circumstances, of either moral good or evil, yet
   it is not granted that the observation of them, even as uncommanded, is
   indifferent in the worship of God. And although the command doth not
   alter the nature, and make that which was indifferent become evil, yet
   that command of itself being contrary to many divine commands and
   instructions given us in the Scripture, a compliance with the things
   commanded therein may become unlawful to us. And what shall they do
   whose judgment this is? Shall they admit of them as lawful, upon the
   consideration of that change about them which renders them unlawful?
   This they will not easily be induced to give their assent unto.

   Let, therefore, the rule of church-communion be observed which our Lord
   Jesus Christ hath fixed, and no small occasion of our strifes and
   divisions will be removed out of the way. But whilst there is this
   contest amongst us, if one pleads his readiness "to do and observe
   whatever the Lord Christ hath commanded," and cannot be convinced of
   insincerity in his profession, or of want of understanding in any known
   institution of his, and thereon requires the communion of any church;
   but others say, "Nay, you shall observe and do sundry other things that
   we ourselves have appointed, or you shall have no communion with us;"
   -- as it cannot be but that divisions and schisms will ensue thereon,
   so it will not be difficult for an indifferent bystander to judge on
   whether side the occasion and guilt of them doth remain.

   2. We have the practice of the apostles, in the pursuance of the
   direction and command of their Lord and ours, for our guide in this
   case. And it might be well and safely thought that this should give a
   certain rule unto the proceedings and actings of all church guides in
   future ages. Now, they did never make any thing unscriptural, or what
   they had not received by divine revelation, to be a condition of
   communion in religious worship and church-order among Christians: for
   as they testified themselves that "they would give themselves
   continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word," Acts vi. 4, so
   it was of old observed concerning them, "that their constant labour was
   for the good of the souls of men in their conversion unto God, and
   edification in faith and holiness;" [4] but as for the institution of
   festivals or fasts, of rites or ceremonies, to be observed in the
   worship of the churches, they intermeddled with no such things. And
   thence it came to pass, that in the first entrance and admission of
   observances about such things, there was a great and endless variety in
   them, both as to the things themselves observed and as to the manner of
   their observation; and this was gradually increased unto such a height
   and excess, as that the burden of them became intolerable unto
   Christendom. Nor, indeed, could any better success be expected in a
   relinquishment and departure from the pattern of church-order given us
   in their example and practice. Neither is the plea from hence built
   merely on this consideration, that no man alive, either from their
   writings or the approved records of those times, can manifest that they
   ever prescribed unto the churches or imposed on them the observance of
   any uninstituted rite, to be observed as a measure and rule of their
   communion, but also it so fell out, in the good providence of God, that
   the case under debate was proposed unto them, and jointly determined by
   them; for, being called unto advice and counsel in the difference that
   was between the Jewish and Gentile converts and professors, wherein the
   former laboured to impose on the latter the observation of Moses'
   institutions as the condition of their joint communion, as was
   mentioned even now, they not only determine against any such
   imposition, but also expressly declare that nothing but "necessary
   things" (that is, such as are so from other reasons antecedently unto
   their prescriptions and appointments) ought to be required of any
   Christians in the communion or worship of the church, Acts xv. And as
   they neither did nor would, on that great occasion, in that solemn
   assembly, appoint any one thing to be observed by the disciples and
   churches which the Lord Christ had not commanded, so in their direction
   given unto the Gentile believers for a temporary abstinence from the
   use of their liberty in one or two instances whereunto it did extend,
   they plainly intimate that it was the avoidance of a present scandal,
   which might have greatly retarded the progress of the gospel, that was
   the reason of that direction. And in such cases it is granted that we
   may in many things for a season forego the use of our liberty. This was
   their way and practice, this the example which they left unto all that
   should follow them in the rule and guidance of the church. Whence it is
   come to pass in after ages that men should think themselves wiser than
   they, or more careful to provide for the peace and unity of the church,
   we know not. But let the bounds and measures of church-communion fixed
   in and by their example stand unmoved, and many causes of our present
   divisions will be taken away. But, it may be, it will be offered, that
   the present state of things in the world requires some alteration in or
   variation from the precise example of the apostles in this matter. The
   due observation of the institutions of Christ, in such manner as the
   nature of them required, was then sufficient unto the peace and unity
   of the churches; but primitive simplicity is now decayed among the
   most, so that a multiplication of rules and observances is needful for
   the same ends. But we have showed before, that the accommodation of
   church rule and communion to the degeneracy of Christians or churches,
   or their secular engagements, is no way advantageous unto religion. Let
   them whose duty it is endeavour to reduce professors and profession to
   the primitive standard of light, humility, and holiness, and they may
   be ordered in all church concerns according to the apostolical pattern.
   Wherefore, when Christians unto the former plea of their readiness to
   observe and do whatsoever Christ hath commanded them, do also add their
   willingness to comply with whatever the apostles of Christ have either
   by precept or example in their own practice commended unto them, or did
   do or require in the first churches, and cannot be convinced of failing
   to make good their profession, we do not know whence any can derive a
   warranty enabling them to impose any other conditions of communion on
   them. The institution, therefore, of the Lord Christ, and the practice
   of the apostles, lie directly against the imposing of the conditions
   inquired about. And first to invent them, then to impose them, making
   them necessary to be observed, and then to judge and censure them as
   schismatics, as enemies to love and peace, who do not submit unto them,
   looks not unlike the exercise of an unwarrantable dominion over the
   faith and consciences of the disciples of Christ.

   3. Not only by their example and practice, but they have also
   doctrinally declared what is the duty of churches, and what is the
   liberty of Christians in this matter. The apostle Paul discourseth at
   large hereon, Rom. xiv., xv. The attentive reading of these two
   chapters is sufficient to determine this cause among all uninterested
   and unprejudiced persons. He supposeth in them, -- and it is the case
   which he exemplifies in sundry instances, -- that there were among
   Christians and churches at that time different apprehensions and
   observances about some things appertaining unto the worship of God; and
   these things were such as had some seeming countenance of a sacred and
   divine authority, for such was their original institution. Some, on the
   consideration hereof, judged that they were still to be observed, and
   their consciences had been long exercised in a holy subjection unto the
   authority of God in the observance of them. Nor was there yet any
   express and positive law enacted for their abrogation; but the ceasing
   of any obligation unto their observance from their primitive
   institution was to be gathered from the nature of God's economy towards
   his church. Many, therefore, continued to observe them, esteeming it
   their duty so to do. Others were persuaded and satisfied that they were
   freed from any obligation unto the owning and observance of them; and
   whereas this liberty was given them by Jesus Christ in the gospel, they
   were resolved to make use of it, and not to comply with the other sort,
   who pressed conformity upon them in their ceremonies and modes of
   divine worship. So it may fall out in other instances. Some may be
   persuaded that such or such things may be lawful for them to observe in
   the worship of God, -- they may be so unto them, and, as is supposed,
   in their own nature; on the consideration of some circumstances, they
   may judge that it is convenient or expedient to attend unto their
   observance; lastly, all coincidences weighed, that it is necessary that
   so they should do, and that others also that walk with them in the
   profession of the gospel should conform themselves unto their order and
   practice. On the other hand, some there are who, because the things of
   the joint practice required are not appointed by Jesus Christ, nor doth
   it appear unto them that he hath given power unto any others to appoint
   them, do not judge it expedient, nor yet, all circumstances considered,
   lawful to observe them. Now, whereas this case answers unto that before
   proposed, the determination thereof given by the apostle may safely be
   applied unto this also. What rule, therefore, doth he give therein,
   which he would have attended unto as the means for the preservation of
   love, peace, and unity among them? Is it that the former sort of
   persons, provided they be the most or have the most power, ought to
   impose the practice of those things which they esteem lawful and
   convenient on those who judge them not so, when it is out of question
   that they are not appointed by Christ, only it is pretended that they
   are not forbidden by him? Where, indeed, the question was about the
   institutions of Christ, he binds up the churches precisely unto what he
   had received from him, 1 Cor. xi. 23; but in cases of this nature,
   wherein a direct command of Christ cannot be pleaded nor is pretended,
   he absolutely rejects and condemns all thoughts of such a procedure.
   But supposing that differences in judgment and practice were and would
   be among Christians, the sum of his advice is, that all offences and
   scandals ought to be diligently avoided; that censuring, judging, and
   despisings, on the account of such differences, be cast out; that
   tenderness be used towards them that are weak, and nothing severely
   pressed on them that doubt; and for their different apprehensions and
   ways, they should all walk in peace, condescending unto and bearing
   with one another. Nothing can more evidently determine the unlawfulness
   of imposing on Christians unscriptural conditions of communion than do
   the discourses of that great apostle to this purpose. Yea, better it
   is, and more agreeable unto the mind of Christ, that persons and
   particular churches should be left unto different observations in
   sundry things relating unto sacred worship, wherein they cannot join
   with each other nor communicate together, endeavouring in the meantime
   to "keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace," than that they
   should be enforced unto a uniformity in the practice of things that
   have not the immediate authority of Christ enstamped on them.
   Accordingly it so fell out among them unto whom the apostle gave these
   directions, and that suitably unto his intention in them; for the
   dissenting parties agreeing in the common faith and profession of the
   gospel, did yet constantly meet in distinct assemblies or churches for
   the celebration of holy worship, because of the different rites wherein
   they did not agree. And in this posture were peace and love continued
   among them, until in process of time, their differences through mutual
   forbearance being extinguished, they coalesced into one church state
   and order. And the former peace which they had in their distances was
   deemed sufficient, whilst things were not measured nor regulated by
   secular interest or advantages. But it is a part of our present
   unhappiness, that such a peace among Christians and particular churches
   is mistaken to have an ill aspect upon the concerns of some belonging
   unto the church in power, honour, and revenue. But as we apprehend
   there is, as things are now stated among us, a plain mistake in this
   surmise, so, if the glory of God and the honour of the gospel were
   chief in our consultations about church affairs, it would be with us of
   no such consideration as to hinder us from committing quietly the
   success and events of duty unto the providence of God.

   4. There was also a signal vindication of the truth pleaded for, in an
   instance of fact among the primitive churches. There was an opinion
   which prevailed very early among them about the necessary observation
   of Easter, in the room of the Jewish passover, for the solemn
   commemoration of the death and resurrection of our Saviour. And it was
   taken for granted by most of them, that the observance hereof was
   countenanced, if not rendered necessary unto them, by the example of
   the apostles; for they generally believed that by them it was observed,
   and that it was their duty to accommodate themselves unto their
   practice; only there was a difference about the precise time or day
   which they were to solemnize as the head and rule of their festival, as
   every undue presumption hath one lameness or other accompanying it, --
   it is truth alone which is square and steady. Some, therefore, pleaded
   the example of John the apostle and evangelist, who, as it is strongly
   asserted and testified by multitudes, kept his Easter at such a time
   and by such a rule; whom they thought meet to follow and imitate.
   Others, not inferior unto them in number or authority, opposed unto
   their time the example of Peter, whom they affirmed (on what grounds
   and reasons they knew best, for they are now lost) to have observed his
   Easter at another time, and according unto a different rule. And it is
   scarcely imaginable how the contests hereabouts troubled the churches
   both of Europe and Asia, who certainly had things more material to have
   exercised themselves about. The church of Rome embraced that opinion
   which at length prevailed over the other, and obtained a kind of
   catholicism against that which was countenanced only by the authority
   of St John; as that church was always wondrous happy in reducing other
   churches unto an acquiescency in its sentiments, as seldom wanting
   desire or skill dexterously to improve its manifold advantages. Now,
   this was that Easter was to be celebrated on the Lord's day only, and
   not by the rule of the Jewish passover, on the fourteenth day of the
   first month, what day of the week soever it fell out upon. Hereon
   Victor, the bishop of that church, being confident that the truth was
   on his side, -- namely, that Easter was to be observed on the Lord's
   day, -- resolved to make it a condition of communion unto all the
   churches, for otherwise he saw not how there could be either union,
   peace, or uniformity among them. He did not question but that he had a
   good foundation to build upon; for that Easter was to be observed by
   virtue of apostolical tradition was generally granted by all. And he
   took it as unquestionable, upon a current and prevalent rumour, that
   the observation of it was confined to the Lord's day by the example of
   St Peter. Hereupon he refused the communion of all that would not
   conform unto his resolution for the observation of Easter on the Lord's
   day, and cast out of communion all those persons and churches who would
   observe any other day; which proved to be the condition of the
   principal churches of Asia, amongst whom the apostle John did longest
   converse. Here was our present case directly exemplified or represented
   so long beforehand. The success only of this fact of his remaineth to
   be inquired into. Now, it is known unto all what entertainment this his
   new rule of communion found among the churches of Christ. The reproof
   of his precipitancy and irregular fixing new bounds unto
   church-communion was famous in those days; especially the rebuke given
   unto him and his practice by one [5] of the most holy and learned
   persons then living is eminently celebrated, as consonant to truth and
   peace, by those who have transmitted unto us the reports of those
   times. He who himself first condemned others rashly was for his so
   doing generally condemned by all. Suppose, now, that any persons living
   at Rome, and there called into communion with the church, should have
   had the condition thereof proposed unto them, -- namely, that they
   should assent and declare that the observation of Easter, by
   apostolical tradition, was to be on the Lord's day only, -- and upon
   their refusal so to do should be excluded from communion, or on their
   own accords should refrain from it, where should the guilt of this
   disorder and schism be charged? And thus it fell out, not only with
   those who came out of Asia to Rome, who were not received by that
   Diotrephes, but also with sundry in that church itself, as Blastus and
   others; as what great divisions were occasioned hereby between the
   Saxons and Britons hath been by many declared. But, in the judgment of
   the primitive churches, the guilt of these schisms was to be charged on
   them that coined and imposed these new rules and conditions of
   communion; and had they not been judged by any, the pernicious
   consequences of this temerarious attempt are sufficient to reflect no
   inconsiderable guilt upon it. Neither could the whole observance
   itself, from first to last, ever compensate that loss of love and peace
   among Christians and churches which was occasioned thereby; nor hath
   the introduction of such things ever obtained any better success in the
   church of God. How free the churches were until that time, after they
   were once delivered from the attempt of the circumcised professors to
   impose upon them the ceremonies of Moses, from any appearance of
   unwritten conditions of communion, is manifest unto all who have looked
   into the monuments which remain of those times. It is very true that
   sundry Christians took upon them very early the observation of sundry
   rites and usages in religion whereunto they had no guidance or
   direction by the word of God; for as the corrupted nature of man is
   prone to the invention and use of sensible present things in religion,
   especially where persons are not able to find satisfaction in those
   that are purely spiritual, requiring great intension of mind and
   affections in their exercise, so were they many of them easily infected
   by that tincture which remained in them from the Judaism or Gentilism
   from which they were converted. But these observances were free, and
   taken up by men of their own accord, not only every church, but every
   person in the most of them, as far as it appears, being left unto their
   own liberty. Some ages it was before such things were turned into laws
   and canons, and that perhaps first by heretics, or at least under such
   a degeneracy as our minds and consciences cannot be regulated by. The
   judgment, therefore, and practice of the first churches are manifest
   against such impositions.

   5. Upon a supposition that it should be lawful for any persons or
   churches to assign unscriptural conditions of their communion, it will
   follow that there is no certain rule of communion amongst Christians
   fixed and determined by Christ. That this is otherwise we have before
   declared, and shall now only manifest the evil consequences of such a
   supposition: for if it be so, no man can claim an admission into the
   society or communion of any church, or a participation in the
   ordinances of the gospel with them, by virtue of the authority of Jesus
   Christ; for notwithstanding all his pleas of submission to his
   institutions, and the observation of his commands, every church may
   propose something, yea, many things, unto him that he hath not
   appointed, without an admission whereof and subjection thereunto he may
   be justly excluded from all church privileges among them. Now, this
   seems not consonant unto the authority that Christ hath over the
   church, nor that honour which ought to be given unto him therein. Nor,
   on the same supposition, are his laws sufficient to rule and quiet the
   consciences, or to provide for the edification of his disciples. Now,
   if Diotrephes is blamed for not receiving the brethren who were
   recommended unto the church by the apostle, 3 John 9, 10, probably
   because they would not submit to that pre-eminence which he had
   obtained among them, they will scarcely escape without reproof who
   refuse those whom the Lord Christ commends unto them by the rules of
   the gospel, because they will not submit unto such new impositions as,
   by virtue of their pre-eminence, they would put upon them. And what
   endless perplexities they must be cast into who have learned in these
   things to call him only Lord and Master is apparent unto all. Baptism,
   with a voluntary credible profession of faith, repentance, and
   obedience unto the Lord Christ, in his commands and institutions, is
   all the warranty which he hath given unto any of his disciples to claim
   their admission into his churches, which are instituted and appointed
   to receive them, and to build them up in their faith. And if any person
   who produceth this warranty, and thereon desireth, according to order,
   the communion of any church, -- if he may be excluded from it or
   forbidden an entrance into it, unless it be on grounds sufficient, in
   the judgment of charity, to evince the falseness and hypocrisy of his
   profession, little regard is had to the authority of Christ, and too
   much unto men's own. Churches, indeed, may more or less insist upon the
   explicitness of this profession and the evidences of its sincerity, as
   they find it tend to their peace and edification, with a due attendance
   unto the rule and example left unto them in this matter in the gospel.
   And that the exercise of this power in any churches may not turn to the
   prejudice of any, every professor is allowed, with reference unto
   particular assemblies, to make his choice of the measure he will comply
   withal, at least if he will make the choice of his habitation
   subservient unto his edification. Hereby the peace and duty both of
   churches and private persons are secured. And this rule of church
   admission and communion furnished Christians with peace, love, and
   unity for many ages, setting aside the ruffle given them in the
   rashness of Victor before mentioned. It was also rendered practicable
   and easy by virtue of their communion as churches among themselves; for
   from thence commendatory letters supplied the room of actual profession
   in them who, having been admitted into one church, did desire the same
   privilege in any other. And on this rule were persons to be "received,"
   though "weak in the faith," though it may be in some things "otherwise
   minded" than the generality of the church, though "babes" and
   "unskilful" as to degrees in the word of truth, Rom. xiv. 1; Phil. iii.
   15; Heb. v. 12-14. But this rule was always attended with a proviso,
   that men did not contradict or destroy their own profession by any
   unholy conversation; for such persons never were, nor never are to be,
   admitted unto the especial ordinances of the church; and a neglect of
   due attendance hereunto is that which principally hath cast us into all
   our confusions, and rendered the institutions of Christ ineffectual.
   And if this warranty, which the Lord Christ hath given unto his
   disciples, of claiming a participation in all the privileges of his
   churches, an admission unto a joint performance of all the duties
   required in them, may, upon the supposition of a power left to impose
   other conditions of communion on them, be rejected and rendered
   useless, all church-communion is absolutely resolved into the variable
   wills of men. The church, no doubt, may judge and determine upon the
   laws of Christ, and their due application unto particular occasions, --
   as whether such persons may according to them be admitted into their
   fellowship; to deprive churches of this liberty is to take away their
   principal use and service: but to make laws of their own, the
   subject-matter whereof shall be things not commanded by Christ, and to
   make them the rule of admitting professed Christians unto their
   communion, is an assumption that cannot be justified. And it is certain
   that the assuming of an authority by some churches for such like
   impositions is that which hath principally occasioned many to deny them
   so to be; so at once to overthrow the foundation of all that authority
   which in so many instances they find to be abused. And although the
   church of Rome may prevail on weak and credulous persons, by proposing
   unto them an absolute acquiescency in their dictates and
   determinations, as the best, readiest, and most facile means of
   satisfaction, yet there is nothing that doth more alienate wise and
   conscientious persons from them than doth that unreasonable proposal.
   Moreover, it is highly probable that endless disputes will arise on
   this supposition about what is meet and convenient, and what not, to be
   added unto the Scripture rules of communion. They have done so in the
   ages past, and continue yet to do. Nor can any man on this principle
   know, or probably conjecture, when he hath a firm station in the
   church, or an indefeasible interest in the privileges thereof; for
   supposing that he hath concocted the impositions of one church, on the
   first removal of his habitation he may have new conditions of communion
   prescribed unto him. And from this perplexity nothing can relieve him
   but a resolution to do in every place whereunto he may come according
   to the manner of the place, be it good or bad, right or wrong. But
   neither hath the Lord Christ left his disciples in this uncertainty
   which the case supposeth, nor will accept of that indifferency which is
   in the remedy suggested. They, therefore, who regulate their communion
   with any churches by the firm stated law of their right and privilege,
   if they are not received thereon, do not by their abstinence from it
   contract the guilt of schism or any blamable divisions.

   Moreover, upon a supposition of such a liberty and power to prescribe
   and impose unwritten conditions of church-communion on Christians, who
   or what law doth or shall prescribe bounds unto men, that they do not
   proceed in their prescriptions beyond what is useful unto edification,
   or unto what will be really burdensome and intolerable unto churches?
   To say that those who claim this power may be securely trusted with it,
   for they will be sure not to fall into any such excesses, will scarcely
   give satisfaction; for besides that such a kind of power is exceedingly
   apt to swell and extend itself unmeasurably, the common experience of
   Christendom lies against this suggestion. Was not an excess of this
   kind complained of by Austin of old, when yet the observation of
   ecclesiastical customs was much more voluntary than in after ages,
   neither were they made absolutely conditions of communion, unless among
   a very few? Do not all Protestants grant and plead that the papal
   church hath exceeded all bounds of moderation and sobriety herein, so
   that from thence they take the principal warranty of their secession
   from it? Do not other churches mutually charge one another on the same
   account? Hath not a charge of this excess been the ball of contention
   in this nation ever since the Reformation? If, then, there be such a
   power in any, either the exercise of it is confined unto certain
   instances by some power superior unto them, or it is left absolutely,
   as unto all particulars whereunto it may be extended, unto their own
   prudence and discretion. The first will not be asserted, nor can be so,
   unless the instances intended can be recounted, and the confirming
   power be declared. If the latter be affirmed, then let them run into
   what excesses they please, unless they judge themselves that so they
   do, which is morally impossible that they should, none ought ever to
   complain of what they do; for there is no failure in them who attend
   unto their rule, which in this case is supposed to be men's own
   prudence and discretion. And this was directly the state of things in
   the church of Rome; whence they thought it always exceedingly unequal
   that any of their ecclesiastical laws should be called in question,
   since they made them according to their own judgment, the sole rule of
   exercising their authority in such things. Where is the certainty and
   stability of this rule? Is it probable that the communion and peace of
   all churches and all Christians are left to be regulated by it? And who
   will give assurance that no one condition directly unlawful in itself
   shall be prescribed and imposed by persons enjoying this pretended
   power? or who can undertake that the number of such conditions as may
   be countenanced by a plea of being things in their own nature
   indifferent, shall not be increased until they come to be such a burden
   and yoke as are too heavy for the disciples of Christ to bear, and
   unlawful for them to submit themselves unto? May any make a judgment
   but themselves who impose them, when the number of such things grows to
   a blamable excess? If others may judge, at least for themselves and
   their own practice, and so of what is lawful or not, it is all that is
   desired. If themselves are the only judges, the case seems very hard,
   and our secession from the church of Rome scarcely warrantable. And who
   sees not what endless contests and differences will ensue on these
   suppositions, if the whole liberty of men's judgments and all
   apprehensions of duty in professors be not swallowed up in the gulf of
   atheistical indifferency as to all the concerns of outward worship?

   The whole of what hath been pleaded on this head might be confirmed
   with the testimony of many of the learned writers of the church of
   England, in the defence of our secession from that of Rome; but we
   shall not here produce them in particular. The sum of what is pleaded
   by them is, That the being of the catholic church lies in essentials;
   that for a particular church to disagree from all other particular
   churches in some extrinsical and accidental things is not to separate
   from the catholic church, so as to cease to be a church. But still,
   whatever church makes such extrinsical things the necessary conditions
   of communion, so as to cast men out of the church who yield not to
   them, is schismatical in its so doing, and the separation from it is so
   far from being schism, that being cast out of that church on these
   terms only returns them unto the communion of the catholic church; and
   nothing can be more unreasonable than that the society imposing such
   conditions of communion should be judge whether those conditions be
   just and equitable or no. To this purpose do they generally plead our
   common cause. Wherefore, from what hath been discoursed, we doubt not
   but to affirm that where unscriptural conditions of communion,
   indispensably to be submitted unto and observed, are by any church
   imposed on those whom they expect or require to join in their
   fellowship, communion, and order, if they on whom they are so imposed
   do thereon withhold or withdraw themselves from the communion of that
   church, especially in the acts, duties, and parts of worship wherein a
   submission unto these conditions is expressed either verbally or
   virtually, they are not thereon to be esteemed guilty of schism; but
   the whole fault of the divisions which ensue thereon is to be charged
   on them who insist on the necessity of their imposition.

   That this is the condition of things with us at present, especially
   such as are ministers of the gospel, with reference unto the church of
   England, as it is known in itself, so it may be evidenced unto all by
   an enumeration of the particulars that are required of us, if we will
   be comprehended in the communion and fellowship thereof. For, --

   1. It is indispensably enjoined that we give a solemn attestation unto
   the liturgy and all contained in it, by the subscription or declaration
   of our assent and consent thereunto; which must be accompanied with the
   constant use of it in the whole worship of God. As was before observed,
   we dispute not now about the lawfulness of the use of liturgies in the
   public service of the church, nor of that in particular which is
   established among us by the laws of the land. Were it only proposed or
   recommended unto ministers for the use of it in whole or in part,
   according as it should be found needful unto the edification of their
   people, there would be a great alteration in the case under
   consideration. And if it be pretended that such a liberty would produce
   greater diversity, yea, and confusion in the worship of God, we can
   only say that it did not so of old, when the pastors of churches were
   left wholly to the exercise of their own gifts and abilities in all
   sacred administrations. But it is the making of an assent and consent
   unto it, with the constant use of it or attendance unto it, a necessary
   condition of all communion with the church which at present is called
   into question. It will not, we suppose, be denied but that it is so
   made unto us all, both ministers and people, and that by such laws,
   both civil and ecclesiastical, as are sufficiently severe in their
   penalties; for we have rules and measures of church-communion assigned
   unto us by laws merely civil. Were there any colour or pretence of
   denying this to be so, we should proceed no farther in this instance;
   but things are evidently and openly with us as here laid down. Now,
   this condition of communion is unscriptural; and the making of it to be
   such a condition is without warranty or countenance from the word of
   God, or the practice of the apostolical and primitive churches. That
   there are no footsteps of any liturgy, or prescribed forms for the
   administration of all church ordinances, to be imposed on the disciples
   of Christ in their assemblies, to be found in the Scripture, no
   intimation of any such thing, no direction about it, no command for it,
   will, we suppose, be acknowledged. Commanded, indeed, we are to make
   "supplications and prayers" for all sorts of men in our assemblies; to
   instruct, lead, guide, and "feed the flock of God," 1 Tim. ii. 1; Acts
   xx. 28; 1 Pet. v. 2; to administer the holy ordinances instituted by
   him; and to do all these things "decently and in order." The apostles
   also, describing the work of the ministry in their own attendance unto
   it, affirm that they would "give themselves continually unto prayer,
   and to the ministry of the word," Acts vi. 4. But that all these things
   should be done (the preaching of the word only excepted) in and by the
   use or reading of a liturgy and the prescribed forms of it, without
   variation or receding from the words and syllables of it in any thing,
   that the Scripture is utterly silent of. If any one be otherwise
   minded, it is incumbent on him to produce instances unto his purpose.
   But withal he must remember, that in this case it is required not only
   to produce a warranty from the Scripture for the use of such forms or
   liturgies, but also that rules are given therein enabling churches to
   make the constant attendance unto them to be a necessary condition of
   their communion. If this be not done, nothing is offered unto the case
   as at present stated. And whatever confidence may be made use of
   herein, we know that nothing unto this purpose can be thence produced.
   It is pleaded, indeed, that our Saviour himself composed a form of
   prayer, and prescribed it unto his disciples: but it is not proved that
   he enjoined them the constant use of it in their assemblies, nor that
   they did so use it, nor that the repetition of it should be a condition
   of communion in them, though the owning of it as by him proposed, and
   for the ends by him designed, may justly be made so; least of all is
   it, or can it be proved, that any rule or just encouragement can hence
   be taken for other men who are neither Jesus Christ nor his apostles,
   but weak and fallible as ourselves, to compose entire liturgies, and
   impose the necessary use of them in all the worship of the Church.
   Neither is there the least countenance to be obtained unto such
   impositions from the practice or example of the first churches.
   Liturgies themselves were an invention of after ages, and the use of
   them now inquired after of a much later date: for those which pretend
   unto apostolical antiquity have long since been convicted to be
   spurious and feigned, nor is there scarce any learned man who hath the
   confidence to assert them to be genuine; and on a supposition that so
   they are, no tolerable reason can be given why the use of them should
   be neglected, and such others taken up as are of a most uncertain
   original. The first condition, therefore, of communion proposed unto us
   is not only unscriptural (which is sufficient unto our present
   argument), but also destitute of any ancient example or usage among the
   churches of Christ to give countenance unto it. This if we admit not
   of, if we attend not unto, we are not only refused communion in other
   things, but also excommunicated, or cast out of the whole communion of
   the church, as many are at this day; yet some are so, not only for
   refusing compliance with the whole of it in general, but for not
   observing every particular direction belonging unto it (as might be
   manifested in instances) of no great importance. If, therefore, any
   divisions or schisms do ensue among us on this account, that some
   indispensably require an assent and consent unto the liturgy and all
   things contained in it as the condition of complete church-communion,
   or a necessary attendance on the whole religious worship thereby
   performed and therein prescribed, which others refuse to admit of as
   such, and thereon forbear the communion proposed unto them, it is
   evident, from the rules laid down, where the guilt of them is to be
   charged. And we do not discourse of what any may do among themselves,
   judging it meet for their edification, nor of what a civil law may
   constitute with respect unto public places, employments, and
   preferments; but only where lies the sin and evil that attends
   divisions arising on these impositions, and which by their removal
   would be taken away. And there seems to be an aggravation of this
   disorder, in that not only all men are refused communion who will not
   submit unto these terms of it, but also they are sought out and exposed
   unto severe penalties if they will not admit of them, though expressly
   contrary to their consciences and persuasions.

   2. Canonical submission unto the present ecclesiastical government of
   the church, and the administration of the discipline thereof, in their
   hands by whom the power of it is possessed, with an acquiescency
   therein, are to the same purpose required of us and expected from us.
   Who these are, and what are the ways and means of their
   administrations, we shall not repeat, as unwilling to give offence unto
   any. We cannot but know how and in what sense these things are proposed
   unto us, and what is expected from us thereon. Neither dare we give
   another sense of them in our minds than what we judge to be the sense
   and intention of them who require our submission and obedience unto
   them. It is not, certainly, their design nor mind that we should look
   on the offices of the church as unwarrantable, and on their rule as
   inconvenient, so as to endeavour a reformation in the one and of the
   other. It is such a conformity they intend as whereby we do, virtually
   at least, declare our approbation of all these things in the church,
   and our acquiescency in them. Neither can we be admitted to put in any
   exception, nor discharge our consciences by a plain declaration of what
   we dislike or dissent from, or in what sense we can submit unto any of
   these things. We take it, therefore, for granted, that in the
   conformity required of us we must cordially and sincerely approve the
   present ecclesiastical government, and the administration of church
   discipline thereby, for it is the profession of our acceptance of it as
   proposed unto us; and if we acquiesce not therein, but express an
   uneasiness under it, we do it at the hazard of the reputation of our
   sincerity and honesty in conforming. Now, this condition of communion
   with the church of England is also unscriptural, and consequently
   unlawful to be made so. This is by many now plainly acknowledged; for
   they say there is no government determined in the Scripture. But this
   now in force amongst us is erected by the authority of the magistrate,
   who hath supreme power in things ecclesiastical; and on that ground a
   lawful government they plead it to be, and lawful to be exercised, and
   so also by others to be submitted to. But we have now sundry times
   declared that this is not our present question. We inquire not whether
   it be lawful or no, or on what account it may be so esteemed, or how
   far it may be submitted unto, or wherein; but we say, the professed
   acknowledging of it, with submission unto it, as the government of the
   church, is required of us as a necessary condition of our communion. If
   they are not so, give us liberty to declare our sense concerning it
   without prejudice; and if it be so, then may we refuse this condition
   as unscriptural. For in the case of conformity, there is not only a
   submission to the government required, but expressly (as was said) an
   approbation of it, that it is such as it ought to be; for in religious
   things our practice declares a cordial approbation, as being a part of
   our profession, wherein we ought to be sincere. Some again make some
   pleas, that bishops, and some government by them, are appointed by the
   apostles, and therefore a submission unto them may be justly required
   as a condition of communion. For we will not now dispute but that
   whatever is so appointed may be so required, although we believe that
   every particular instance of this nature is not rigidly to be insisted
   on, if it belong not unto the essentials of the church, and it be
   dubious to some whether it be so appointed or no; but yet neither doth
   an admittance of this plea give us any relief in this matter: for
   suppose it should or might be proved that there ought to be, according
   to the mind of Christ, in all churches, bishops, with a pre-eminence
   above presbyters in order or degree, and that the rule of the church
   doth principally belong unto them that are so, yet will not this
   concession bear an application to the present question, so as to afford
   us any relief; for the granting of things so dubious and questionable
   can never give them such an evidence of truth and firmitude in the
   church as to warrant the making of them necessary conditions of
   communion unto all Christians. Neither doth it follow, from any thing
   that pretendeth to fall under Scripture proof, that such bishops should
   be diocesan; that they should depend on archbishops over them; that
   they should assume the whole power of church rule and discipline into
   their hands; that they should administer it by chancellors,
   archdeacons, commissaries, and the like; that this should be done by
   presentments, or indictments, citations, processes, litigious
   pleadings, after the manner of secular or civil courts, to the
   exclusion of that rule and discipline which the gospel directs unto,
   with the management of it in love and brotherly compassion, in the name
   and by the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ. But these things we shall
   not in particular insist upon, for the reason before given. This we
   must say, that take the whole of the government and the administration
   thereof together, -- which by the conformity required of us we must
   testify our approbation of and acquiescence in, or we deal
   hypocritically with them that require it of us, -- and we know it to be
   so far unscriptural as that an acknowledgment of it and submission unto
   it cannot duly and justly be made a necessary condition of communion
   unto us. It may be it will be said that submission unto the government
   of the church is not so much a condition of communion with it as it is
   that wherein our communion itself with it doth consist, and it is but a
   fancy to think of communion with a church without it. But this is
   otherwise; as appears in those churches where all rule and government
   being left in the hand of the civil magistrate, there communion is
   merely spiritual in the administration of evangelical ordinances. And
   might but that be admitted which nature, reason, the law of the
   Christian faith and gospel obedience, do require, -- namely, that
   church-fellowship and communion be built upon men's own judgment and
   choice, -- this would go a great way towards the pacification of our
   differences. But if this be so, and that all church-communion consists
   in submission to the government of it, or at least that it doth so
   principally, it becomes them by whom it is owned and avowed so to do to
   take care that that government be derived from the authority of Christ,
   and administered according to his mind, or all church-communion,
   properly so called, will be overthrown.

   3. We are required to use and observe the ceremonies in worship which
   the present church hath appointed, or doth use and observe. This also
   is made a necessary condition of communion unto us; for many are at
   this day actually cast out of all communion for not observing of them.
   Some are so proceeded against for not observing of holy-days, some for
   not kneeling at the sacrament of the Lord's supper, some for not using
   the sign of the cross in baptism; and what would become of ministers
   that should neglect or omit to wear the surplice in sacred
   administrations is easy to conjecture. But these things are all of them
   unwritten and unscriptural. Great and many, indeed, have been the
   disputes of learned men to prove that although they have no divine
   institution, nor yet example of apostolical or primitive practice, yet
   that they may be lawfully used, for decency and order in the worship of
   God. Whether they have evinced what they aimed at is as yet
   undetermined. But supposing in this case all to be as they would
   pretend and plead that it should be, yet because they are all granted
   to be arbitrary inventions of men, and very few of those who make use
   of them are agreed what is their proper use and signification, or
   whether they have any or no, they are altogether unmeet to be made a
   necessary condition of communion; for inquiry may be made, on what
   warranty or by what rule they may be appointed so to be? Those who
   preside in and over the churches of Christ do so in his name and by his
   authority; and therefore they can impose nothing on them, as a
   condition of their communion together, but what his name is upon or
   what they have his authority for, and it will be dangerous to set his
   seal unto our own appointments. For what men think meet to do
   themselves in the matters of the house of God and his worship, it may
   be measured and accepted with him according to their light and design;
   but for what they impose on others, and that under no less penalty than
   the deprivation of the outward administration of all the privileges
   procured for them by Jesus Christ, they ought to have his warrant and
   authority for. And their zeal is to be bewailed who not only cast men
   out of all church-communion, so far as in them lieth, for a refusal to
   observe those voluntarily-imposed ceremonies in sacred worship, but
   also prosecute them with outward force, to the ruin of them and their
   families; and we cannot but wonder that any should as yet think meet to
   make use of prisons, and the destruction of men thereby, as an appendix
   of their ecclesiastical discipline, exercised in it he highest
   severity, on no greater occasions than the omission of the observance
   of these ceremonies. Whether such proceedings are measured by present
   interest, or the due consideration of what will be pleasing to the Lord
   Jesus Christ at the last day, is not difficult to determine.

   4. As we are ministers, there is in some cases required of us, under
   the same penalty, an oath of canonical obedience. We need not labour to
   prove this to be unscriptural; nor, to avoid provocations, shall we at
   present declare the rise, nature, and use of it, with the fierce
   digladiations that have formerly been about it We can look upon it no
   otherwise but as that which is contrary to the liberty and unworthy of
   the office of a minister of the gospel.

   We know not any thing else which is required of us unto the end
   mentioned, unless it be of some a subscription unto the articles of
   religion. And this, because the Scripture enjoins unto all a consent
   unto sound doctrine and a form of wholesome words, may be admitted so
   far as those articles concern only points of faith; but whereas there
   is annexed unto them and enjoined, with other things, an approbation of
   all those instances of conditions of communion before insisted on, a
   subscription unto the whole becomes of the same nature with things
   themselves therein approved of.

   These are the conditions of communion with the church of England which
   are proposed unto us, and which we are indispensably to submit unto if
   we intend to be partakers thereof; and these are all that we know of
   that nature. That any of these are in particular prescribed in the word
   of God, much less that they can derive any warranty from thence to be
   made necessary conditions of church-communion, will not, we suppose, be
   pretended by any. If, therefore, any divisions do ensue on the refusal
   of some to admit of these conditions, the guilt of them cannot, by any
   rule of Scripture, or from any example of the first churches, be
   charged on them who make that refusal. Other groundless accusations and
   charges we value not, for this is but man's day, the judgment whereof
   we neither stand nor fall unto; yea, we esteem ourselves obliged, in
   all peaceableness and sobriety, to bear witness against such
   impositions, and unto that liberty wherewith the Lord Christ hath made
   his churches and disciples free. And if once things were come unto that
   state that men would assign no other terms of church-communion than
   what Christ hath appointed, it would quickly appear where the guilt of
   our divisions would yet remain, if any such divisions would yet remain;
   but so long as there is a desire to make the wills and wisdoms of some
   men, fallible even as others, the rule and measure of obedience in
   spiritual things, an end of strife and contention among Christians will
   be expected in vain. And this we say with hearts in some measure
   sensible and pained to see the body of Christ torn in pieces by the
   lusts, passions, and carnal interests of men. Could we contribute any
   thing to the healing of the wounds and ruptures that are amongst
   Christians, provided it may have a consistency with the mind of Christ
   and the duty we owe unto him (as, indeed, nothing else will really
   contribute any thing thereunto), we should with all readiness and
   faithfulness give up our best endeavours therein; and where we can do
   nothing else, we hope we shall bear with patience those disdainful
   reproaches which the pride of men, blown up by a confluence of secular,
   perishing advantages, prompts them to pour out upon us for our
   noncompliance with their impositions.

   Secondly, By the conformity required of us, we must consent unto the
   omission of sundry duties, which are made so unto us by the command and
   appointment of Jesus Christ. If we are at any time hindered in the
   discharge of any necessary duty by others, we have somewhat to plead in
   our own excuse, but if we ourselves voluntarily consent to the neglect
   or omission of them, we cannot avoid the guilt of sin; and the worst
   way whereby such a consent may be expressed is by compact and agreement
   with others, as though it were in our power to bargain with other men
   what duties we will observe and what we will omit in the worship of
   God. Now, in the conformity required of us we are to give this consent,
   and that as it were by compact and agreement, which deprives us of all
   pretence of excuse in our omissions. It is no time afterward to plead
   that we would discharge such duties were we not hindered or forbidden,
   -- we have ourselves antecedently and voluntarily renounced a concern
   in such forbidden duties; for no man can honestly conform but it is
   with a declared resolution to accept of all the terms and consequents
   of it, with an approbation of them. Under this notion it is that we
   look on conformity; and what others apprehend thereby or understand
   therein, who seem to press men to conform unto what they do not
   approve, we know not. If, then, there be any omission of known duties
   inseparably accompanying our conformity, that thereby we solemnly
   consent unto.

   This, therefore, we are obliged to refuse, because without sin, in the
   voluntary neglect and omission of duty, we cannot comply with it;
   which, therefore, can be no schism in us, nor what might in any way
   render us blamable. The Lord Christ hath prescribed no such law of
   unity and peace unto his churches as that his disciples should be bound
   constantly to neglect any known duty which they owe to himself for
   their sakes; nor do his institutions interfere, that the observance of
   any one should exclude a due attendance unto another. Neither doth he
   by his commands bring any one into a necessity of doing that which is
   evil, or of omitting any thing that is required of him in the way of
   duty. However, therefore, we value church peace and union, we dare not
   purchase it by an abrenunciation of any duty we owe to Jesus Christ;
   nor would an agreement procured on such terms be of any use unto us, or
   of advantage to the church itself. Wherefore, that compliance in
   church-communion which would be obstructive of any necessary duties is
   not by the Lord Christ enjoined us; and therefore its omission cannot
   be culpable in us: but it would itself be our sin; especially would it
   be thus where the duties so to be omitted are such as are incumbent on
   us by virtue of especial office, wherein we are peculiarly required to
   be faithful. It remaineth, therefore, only that we declare wherein we
   should by conformity engage unto the omission of such duties as are
   indispensably required of us; and this we shall do in some few
   instances:--

   1. Every minister of the gospel hath, by the appointment of Jesus
   Christ, the whole immediate care of the flock whereof he is overseer
   committed unto him. That no part hereof which belong unto their
   edification is exempted from him, the charge that is given unto him and
   the account which will be expected from him do sufficiently evidence.
   For as ministers are called overseers, rulers, guides, pastors, and the
   like, so are they commanded to feed the flock, to take the oversight of
   it, and to rule the house of God, Acts xx. 17, 28; 1 Tim. iii. 5; 1
   Pet. v. 1-4; Heb. xiii. 17; -- a discharge of all which must come into
   their account. Nor is there any word spoken in the whole Scripture,
   relating to the rule and government of the church, which is not spoken
   principally with respect unto them. Nor is there the least intimation
   of an exemption of any part of the discipline of the gospel from their
   office or care. If it be pretended that there is, let the places be
   produced wherein such an exemption is made, or any instances of it
   among the first churches, and they shall be considered; for hitherto no
   such thing has been attempted that we know of. Nor is it at all
   concluded from the plea that some are appointed unto a superior degree
   above others in the rule of the church; for a man may have the whole
   rule of his flock committed unto him, although he should be obliged to
   give an account unto others of his discharge thereof. It is, therefore,
   the duty of all ministers of the gospel, not only to teach, instruct,
   and preach to their flocks, but to go before them also in rule and
   government, and in the exercise of the spiritual discipline appointed
   in the gospel, in the order wherein it is appointed, for their
   edification. The keys of the kingdom of heaven are committed unto them,
   or they are not: if they are not, by what authority do they take upon
   them to open and shut in the house of God, in ministerial teaching and
   authoritative administration of sacred ordinances? for these things
   belong unto the authority which is given by Christ under that
   metaphorical expression of "the keys of the kingdom of heaven," the
   reason of the allusion and its application being obvious. And if these
   are not received by any, they are usurpers if they undertake to
   administer unto the church authoritatively in the name of Jesus Christ.
   If they are given or granted unto them, how may it be made to appear
   that they are so for the ends mentioned only, but not for the rule and
   government of the church, which also belongs unto them? where is the
   exemption in the grant made to them? where are the limits assigned unto
   their power, that they shall exercise it in some concerns of the
   kingdom of heaven, but not in others? And whereas the greatest and most
   necessary parts of this power, such as are ministerial teaching and the
   administration of the sacraments, are confessedly committed unto them,
   how comes it to pass that the less should be reserved from them; for
   whereas the former are necessary to the very being of the church, the
   latter are esteemed by some scarcely to belong unto it. To say that
   bishops only receive these keys, and commit or lend the use of them to
   others, for such ends and purposes as they are pleased to limit, is
   both foreign to the Scripture and destructive of all ministerial power.
   And if ministers are not the ministers of Christ, but of men; if they
   have not their authority from him, but from others; if that may be
   parcelled out unto them which they have from him, at the pleasure of
   any over them, -- there needs not much contending about them or their
   office.

   Besides, the relation of these things one to another is such, as that
   if they were absolutely separated, their efficacy unto edification will
   be exceedingly impaired, if not destroyed. If those who have the
   dispensation of the word committed unto them have not liberty and
   authority; if it be not part of their office-duty to watch over them
   unto whom it is dispensed, and that accompanied with spiritual weapons,
   "mighty through God" towards the fulfilling of the obedience of some
   and the "revenging of disobedience" in others; if they have no power to
   judge, admonish, or censure them that walk unanswerably to the doctrine
   of the gospel preached unto them, and whose profession they have taken
   upon them, -- they will be discouraged in the pursuit of their work,
   and the word itself be deprived of a helpful means appointed by Christ
   himself to further its efficacy. And those who shall content themselves
   with the preaching of the word only, without an inquiry after its
   success in the minds and lives of them that are committed to their
   charge, by virtue of that care and authoritative inspection which
   indeed belongs to their office, will find that as they do discharge but
   one part of their duty, so they will grow cold and languid therein
   also. And when there hath been better success, -- as there hath where
   some against their wills have been hindered by power from the exercise
   of the charge laid on them by Christ in this matter, making up as they
   were able, by private solicitude and persuasion, what they were
   excluded from attending unto in public ministerial acts, -- it hath
   been an effect of especial favour from God, not to be ordinarily
   expected on the account of any rule. And thence it is that, for the
   most part, things openly and visibly do fall out otherwise, the people
   being little reformed in their lives, and preachers waxing cold and
   formal in their work. And if the censures of the church are
   administered by them who preach not the word unto the people, they will
   be weak and nervous as unto any influence on the consciences of men.
   Their minds, indeed, may be affected by them so far as they are
   attended with outward penalties; but how little this tends unto the
   promotion of holiness or the reformation of men's lives experience doth
   abundantly testify. Church discipline and censures are appointed merely
   and solely to second, confirm, and establish the word, and to vindicate
   it from abuse and contempt, as expressing the sense that Jesus Christ
   hath of them by whom it is received, and of them by whom it is
   despised. And it is the word alone which gives authority unto
   discipline and censures. Where, therefore, they are so separated, as
   that those by whom the word is administered are excluded from an
   interest in the exercise of discipline, and those unto whom the
   administration of discipline is committed are such as neither do nor
   for the most part ought to preach the word, it cannot be but that the
   efficacy and success of them both will be impeded.

   2. It is so, also, as to the administration of the sacraments,
   especially that of the supper of the Lord. These are the principal
   mysteries of our religion, as to its external form and administration,
   -- the sacred rites whereby all the grace, mercy, and privileges of the
   gospel are sealed and confirmed unto them who are in a due manner made
   partakers of them. About them, therefore, and their orderly
   administration, did the primitive churches always use their utmost care
   and diligence; and these in an especial manner did they make use of
   with respect unto them to whom they were to be communicated: for they
   feared, partly lest men should be made partakers of them to their
   disadvantage, being not so qualified as to receive them to their
   benefit, as knowing that where persons through their own defaults
   obtain not spiritual profit by them, they are in no small danger of
   having them turned into a snare; and partly that these holy and sacred
   institutions themselves might neither be profaned, contaminated, nor
   exposed unto contempt. Hence, of those who gave up their names unto the
   church, and took upon them the profession of the gospel, the greatest
   part were continued for a long season under their care and inspection,
   but were not admitted into the society of the church in those
   ordinances until upon good trial they were approved. And if any one
   after his admittance was found to walk unanswerably unto his
   profession, or to fall into any known sin, whence offence did ensue
   among the faithful, he was immediately dealt withal in the discipline
   of the church, and, in case of impenitency, separated from the
   congregation. Nor did the guides or pastors of the church think they
   had any greater trust committed unto them than in this, that they
   should use their utmost care and diligence that persons unmeet and
   unworthy might not be admitted into that church relation wherein they
   should have a right to approach unto the table of the Lord, and to
   remove from thence such as had demeaned themselves unworthy of that
   communion. This they looked on as belonging unto their ministerial
   office, and as a duty required of them in the discharge thereof by
   Jesus Christ. And herein they had sufficient direction, both in the
   rule of the word, as also in the nature of the office committed unto
   them, and of the work wherewith they were intrusted; for all ministers
   are stewards of the mysteries of Christ, of whom it is required that
   they should be faithful. Now, as it belongs unto a faithful steward to
   distribute unto the household of his lord the provisions which he hath
   made for them and allows unto them in due season; so also to keep off
   those from partaking in them, who without his master's order and
   warrant, would intrude themselves into his family, and unjustly possess
   themselves of the privileges of it. In these things doth the
   faithfulness of a steward consist. And the same is required in
   ministers of the gospel with respect unto the household of their Lord
   and Master, and the provision that he hath made for it. These,
   therefore, being undeniably parts of the duty of faithful pastors or
   ministers, it is evident how many of them we must solemnly renounce a
   concernment in, upon a compliance with the conformity in matter and
   manner required of us. Neither are these duties such as are of light
   importance, or such as may be omitted without any detriment unto the
   souls of men. The glory of Christ, the honour of the gospel, the purity
   of the church and its edification, are greatly concerned in them. And
   they in whose minds a neglect of these things is countenanced, by their
   attendance unto some outward forms and appearances of order, have
   scarcely considered Him aright with whom they have to do. Some,
   therefore, of these duties we shall instance in:-- First, it is the
   duty of all faithful ministers of the gospel to consider aright who are
   so admitted into the church as to obtain a right thereby unto a
   participation of all its holy ordinances. Take care they must that none
   who have that right granted them by the law of Christ be discouraged or
   excluded, nor any altogether unworthily admitted. And hereunto, as it
   is generally acknowledged, a credible profession of repentance, faith,
   and obedience (that is, of those which are sincere and saving) is
   required. To neglect an inquiry after these things in those that are to
   be admitted unto the table of the Lord is to prostitute the holy
   ordinances of the gospel unto contempt and abuse, and to run cross to
   the constant practice of the church in all ages, even under its
   greatest degeneracy. And the right discharge of this duty, -- if we may
   be allowed to be in earnest in spiritual things, if it be believed that
   it is internal grace and, holiness for the sake whereof all outward
   administrations are instituted and celebrated, -- is of great weight
   and importance to the souls of men; for on the part of persons to be
   admitted, if they are openly and visibly unworthy, what do we thereby
   but what lies in us to destroy their souls? It cannot be but that their
   hardening and impenitency in sin will be hazarded thereby; for whereas
   they have granted unto them the most solemn pledge of the Lord Christ's
   acceptance of them, and of his approbation of their state towards God,
   that the church is authorized to give, what reason have they to think
   that their condition is not secure, or to attend unto the doctrine of
   the church pressing them to look after a change and relinquishment of
   it? For although the administration of the sealing ordinances doth not
   absolutely set the approbation of Christ unto every individual person
   made partaker of them, yet it doth absolutely do so to the profession
   which they make. They witness in the name of Christ his approbation of
   it, and therewithal of all persons, according to their real interest in
   it and answering of it. But those who in no considerable instances do
   answer this profession can obtain nothing unto themselves but an
   occasion of hardening, and rendering them secure in a state of
   impenitency; for tell men whilst you please of the necessity of
   conversion to God, of reformation, and a holy life, yet if, in the
   course of their unholiness, you confirm unto them the love of Christ,
   and give them pledges of their salvation by him, they will not much
   regard your other exhortations. And thence it is come to pass in the
   world that the conformity (worth that we contend about ten thousand
   times over) which ought to be between the preaching of the word, the
   administration of the sacraments, and the lives of them who are
   partakers of them, is for the most part lost. The word still declares
   that without regeneration, without saving faith, repentance, and
   obedience, none can enter into the kingdom of God. In the
   administration of the other ordinances there is an abatement made of
   this rigorous determination, and men have their salvation assured unto
   them without a credible profession, yea, or a pretence of these
   qualifications; and the lives of the most who live in the enjoyment of
   these things seem to declare that they neither believe the one nor much
   regard the other.

   In the meantime, the church itself, as to its purity and the holiness
   of its communion, is damaged by the neglect of a careful inspection
   into this duty; for it cannot be but that ignorance, worldliness, and
   profaneness, will spread themselves as a leprosy over such a church,
   whence their communion will be of very little use and advantage unto
   believers. And hereby do churches, which should be the glory of Christ,
   by their expression of the purity, the holiness, and excellency of his
   person and doctrine, become the principal means and occasions of his
   dishonour in the world; and he that shall read that "Christ loved his
   church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it
   with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it unto
   himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
   thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish," Eph. v. 25-27,
   will be much to seek after the effects of this design of Christ in his
   love and death, if he measure them by what appears in churches under
   the power and influence of this neglect. Nor do those who plead for the
   continuance of things in such a state, without reformation,
   sufficiently consider the representation that the Lord Christ made of
   himself when he was about to deal with his churches, some of which were
   overtaken with carelessness and negligence in this matter; and yet hath
   he therein laid down a rule as to what kind of proceedings particular
   churches are to expect from him in all generations. And it is a matter
   of no small amazement that any churches dare approve and applaud
   themselves in such a state of impurity and defection as is evidently
   condemned by him in those primitive patterns. Do men think he is
   changed, or that he will approve in them what he judged and condemned
   in others? or do they suppose he minds these things no more, and
   because he is unseen, that he seeth not? But we shall all find at
   length that he is "the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever," and that
   as the judge of all he stands at the door.

   Now this duty, by conformity, we renounce a concernment in, so as to
   attend unto it, by virtue of ministerial authority; whence the guilt of
   all the evil consequents thereof before mentioned must fall on us: for
   it is known that a mere shadow of the work of this duty, and not so
   much as a shadow of authority for it, would be left unto us. For what
   is allowed in case of a sudden emergency, upon an offence taken by the
   whole congregation at the wickedness of any (which is instructed
   beforehand that this ought to be no matter of offence unto them), as it
   may be it cannot be proved ever to have been observed in any one
   instance, so the allowed exercise of it would yield no relief in this
   case. And if any should extend the rule beyond the interpretation that
   is put upon it by the present current administration of
   church-discipline, there is no great question to be made what
   entertainment he would meet withal for his so doing. And it is to no
   purpose to come into the church as it were on purpose to go out again.
   And if, instead of dealing with the souls and consciences of men in the
   name and authority of Christ, as stewards of his mysteries, any can
   content themselves to be informers of crimes unto others, we desire
   their pardon if we cannot comply with them therein. And this is the sum
   of what at present we are pleading about: It is the duty of ministers
   of particular churches to judge and take care concerning the fitness of
   them, according unto the rule of the gospel and the nature of the duty
   required of them, who are to be admitted into the fellowship of the
   church, and thereby into a participation of all the holy ordinances
   thereof. This charge the Lord Christ hath committed unto them, and
   hereof will require an account from them. Upon the neglect or right
   discharge of this duty consequents of great moment do depend; yea, the
   due attendance unto it hath a great influence into the preservation of
   the being of the church, and is the hinge whereon the well-being of it
   doth turn. But the power of exercising ministerial authority, in a just
   attendance unto this duty, we must renounce in our conformity, if we
   should submit thereunto; for we have showed before, that after we have
   conformed, we can pretend no excuse from what is enjoined of us or
   forbidden unto us by virtue thereof, all being founded in our own
   voluntary act and consent. Hence, the guilt of this omission must
   wholly fall on us; which we are not willing to undergo.

   There are, we know, many objections raised against the committing of
   this power and trust unto the ministers of particular congregations.
   Great inconveniences are pretended as the consequences of it. The
   ignorance and unfitness of most ministers for the discharge of such a
   trust, if it should be committed unto them, the arbitrariness and
   partiality which probably others will exercise therein, the yoke that
   will be brought on the people thereby, and disorder in the whole, are
   usually pleaded to this purpose and insisted on. But, --

   1. This trust is committed unto some or other by Christ himself; and it
   is necessary that so it should be. Never did he appoint, nor is it
   meet, nor was it ever practised in the primitive church, that every one
   should at his pleasure, on his own presumption, intrude himself into a
   participation of the holy things of the house of God. The consideration
   of men's habitations, with their age, and the like, are of no
   consideration with respect unto any rule of the gospel. Either,
   therefore, it must be left unto the pleasure and will of every man, be
   he never so ignorant, wicked, or profligate, to impose himself on the
   communion of any church of Christ, or there must be a judgment in the
   church concerning them who are to be admitted unto their communion.

   2. From the first planting of the Christian religion, those who
   preached the gospel unto the conversion of the souls of men were
   principally intrusted with this power; and it was their duty to gather
   them who were so converted into that church order and fellowship
   wherein they might partake of the sacred mysteries or solemn ordinances
   of the Christian worship. And this course of proceeding continued
   uninterrupted, with some little variation in the manner of the exercise
   of this power and duty, until corruption had spread itself over the
   face of the whole professing church in the world. But still a shadow
   and resemblance of it was retained; and in the papal church itself to
   this day, particular confessors are esteemed competent judges of the
   meetness of their penitents for an admission unto the sacraments of
   their church. And who shall now be esteemed more meet for the discharge
   of this duty than those who succeed in the office and work of preaching
   the word, whereby men are prepared for church-society? And as it is a
   thing utterly unheard-of in antiquity, that those who dispensed the
   word unto the illumination and conversion of men should not have the
   power of their disposal, as to their being added to the church or
   suspended for a time, as there was occasion; so it is as uncouth that
   those who now sustain the same place and office unto several
   congregations attending on their ministry should be deprived of it.

   3. If there be that ignorance and disability in ministers as is
   pretended, the blame of it reflects on them by whom they are made; and
   we are not obliged to accommodate any of the ways or truths of Christ
   unto the sins and ignorance of men. And if they are insufficient for
   this work, how come they to be so sufficient for that which is greater,
   -- namely, to divide the word aright unto all their hearers? But we
   speak of such ministers as are competently qualified, according to the
   rule of the gospel, for the discharge of their office, and no other
   ought there to be; and such there are, blessed be God, through the
   watchful care of our Lord Jesus Christ over his church, and his
   supplies of the gifts of his Spirit unto them. And such as these know
   it is their duty to study, meditate, pray, ask counsel and advice of
   others, perhaps of more wisdom and experience than themselves, that
   they may know how in all things to behave themselves in the house of
   God. Nor will God be wanting unto them who in sincerity seek direction
   from him for the discharge of any duty which he calls them unto. Other
   security of regular, orderly, and useful proceedings in this matter,
   Christ hath not given us, nor do we need; for the due observance of his
   appointments will not fail the attaining of his ends, which ought to be
   ours also.

   4. The judgment and acting of the church-officers, in the admission of
   persons into the complete society of the faithful, is not arbitrary, as
   is pretended. They have the rule of the Scripture, which they are
   diligently to attend unto. This is the entire rule which the Lord
   Christ hath left unto his church, both for their doctrine and
   discipline; whatever is beyond this or beside it is not his, nor owned
   by him. What is not done according to this rule is of no force in the
   consciences of men, though it may stand, until lawfully recalled, for
   the preservation of outward order. And whatever arbitrariness may be
   supposed in making a judgment upon the rule of the word, or in the
   application of its rule unto the present case, it must abide in some or
   other. And who shall be thought more meet or able to make a right
   determination thereon than those whose duty it is, and who have the
   advantage to be acquainted with all the circumstances belonging to the
   case proposed? Besides, there is the judgment of the church, or the
   congregation itself; which is greatly to be regarded. Even in the
   church of England, a suspension of any from the Lord's supper is
   allowed unto the curate, upon the offence of the congregation: which is
   a sufficient evidence that a judgment in this case is owned to be their
   due; for none can take offence but upon a judgment of the matter at
   which he is offended, nor, in this case, without a right to determine
   that some offences ought to debar persons from a participation of the
   holy ordinances, as also what those offences are. This, therefore, is
   to be considered as an aid and assistance unto ministers in the
   discharge of their duty. It is the church into whose communion persons
   are to be admitted. And although it be no way necessary that
   determinations in this case should be always made by suffrage or a
   plurality of votes in the body of the church, yet, if the sense or mind
   of the congregation may be known, or is so (upon the inquiry that ought
   to be made unto that purpose), that any persons are unmeet for their
   communion, it is not convenient they should be received; nor will their
   admission, in this case, be of any advantage to themselves or the
   church. The light of reason, and the fundamental, constitutive
   principles of all free societies, such as the church is, ascribe this
   liberty unto it; and the primitive church practised accordingly, Acts
   ix. 26-28; Rom. xiv. 1. So, also, is the judgment and desire of the
   congregation to be considered in the admission of any, if they are made
   known to the guides of it; for it is expected from them they should
   confirm their love unto them without dissimulation, as members of the
   same body: and, therefore, in their approbation of what is done, their
   rulers have light and encouragement in their own duty. Besides, there
   is appointed, and ought to be preserved, a communion among churches
   themselves. By virtue hereof, they are not only to make use of mutual
   aid, advice, and counsel, antecedently unto actings of importance, but
   each particular church is, upon just demand, to give an account unto
   other churches of what they do in the administration of the ordinances
   of the gospel among them; and if in any thing it hath mistaken or
   miscarried, to rectify them upon their advice and judgment. And it were
   easy to manifest how, through these means and advantages, the
   edification of the church and the liberty of Christians is sufficiently
   secured in that discharge of duty which is required in the pastors of
   the churches about the admission of persons unto a participation of
   holy ordinances in them.

   5. This duty, therefore, must either be wholly neglected, -- which will
   unavoidably tend to the corrupting and debauching of all churches, and
   in the end unto their ruin, -- or it must be attended unto by each
   particular church under the conduct of their guides and rulers, or some
   others must take it upon themselves. What hath been the issue of a
   supposal that it may be discharged in the latter way is too well known
   to be insisted on: for whilst those who undertake the exercise of
   church-power are such as do not dispense the word or preach it unto
   them towards whom it is to be exercised, but are strangers unto their
   spiritual state, and all the circumstances of it; whilst they have no
   way to act or exercise their presumed authority but by citations,
   processes, informations, and penalties, according to the manner of
   secular courts of judicature in causes civil and criminal; whilst the
   administration of it is committed unto men utterly unacquainted with
   and unconcerned in the discipline of the gospel, or the preservation of
   the church of Christ in purity and order; and whilst herein many, the
   most, or all of them who are so employed, have thereby outward
   emoluments and advantages, which they do principally regard, -- the due
   and proper care of the right order of the churches, unto the glory of
   Christ and their own edification, is utterly omitted and lost. It is
   true, many think this the only decent, useful, and expedient way for
   the government of the church; and think it wondrous unreasonable that
   others will not submit thereunto and acquiesce therein. But what would
   they have us do? or what is it that they would persuade us unto? Is it
   that this kind of rule in and over the church hath institution given it
   in the Scripture, or countenance from apostolical practice? Both they
   and we know that no pretence of any such plea can be made. Is it that
   the first churches after the apostles, or the primitive church, did
   find such a kind of rule to be necessary, and therefore erected it
   among themselves? There is nothing more remote from truth. Would they
   persuade us that as ministers of the gospel, and such as have or may
   have the care of particular churches committed unto us, we have no such
   concernment in these things but what we may solemnly renounce, and
   leave them wholly to the management of others? We are not able to
   believe them. The charge that is given unto us, the account that will
   be required, of us, the nature of the office we are called unto,
   continually testify other things unto us. Wherefore, we dare not
   voluntarily engage into the neglect or omission of this duty, which
   Christ requireth at our hands, and of whose neglect we see so many sad
   consequents and effects. The Lord Christ, we know, hath the same
   thoughts, and makes the same judgment of his churches, as he did of
   old, when he made a solemn revelation and declaration of them; and then
   we find that he charged the failings, neglects, and miscarriages of the
   churches principally upon the angels or ministers of them. And we would
   not willingly, by our neglect, render ourselves obnoxious unto his
   displeasure, nor betray the churches whereunto we do relate unto his
   just indignation, for their declension from the purity of his
   institutions, and the vigour of that faith and love which they had
   professed. We should, moreover, by the conformity required of us, and
   according to the terms on which it is proposed, engage ourselves
   against the exercise of our ministerial office and power, with respect
   unto them who are already members of particular churches; for this we
   carry along with us, that by conforming we voluntarily consent unto the
   whole state of conformity, and unto all that we are to do or not to do
   by the law thereof. Now, it is not to be expected that all who are duly
   initiated or joined unto any church shall always walk blameless,
   according unto the evangelical rule of obedience, without giving
   offence unto others. The state of the church is not like to be so
   blessed in this world, that all who belong unto it should be constantly
   and perpetually inoffensive. This, indeed, is the duty of all, but it
   will fall out otherwise. It did so amongst the primitive churches of
   old; and is not, therefore, otherwise to be expected amongst us, on
   whom the ends of the world are come, and who are even pressed with the
   decays and ruins of it. Many hypocrites may obtain an admission into
   church societies, by the strictest rules that they can proceed upon
   therein; and these, after they have known and professed the ways of
   righteousness, may, and often do, turn aside from the holy commandment
   delivered unto them, and fall again into the pollutions of the world.
   Many good men, and really sincere believers, may, through the power of
   temptations, be surprised into faults and sins scandalous to the
   gospel, and offensive to the whole congregation whereof they are
   members. Hath the Lord Christ appointed no relief in and for his
   churches in such cases; no way whereby they may clear themselves from a
   participation in such impieties, or deliver themselves from being
   looked on as those who give countenance unto them, as they who continue
   in this communion may and ought to be; no power whereby they may put
   forth from among them the old leaven, which would otherwise infect the
   whole; no way to discharge themselves and their societies of such
   persons as are impenitent in their sins; no means for the awakening,
   conviction, humiliation, and recovery of them that have offended; no
   way to declare his mind and judgment in such cases, with the sentence
   that he denounceth in heaven against them that are impenitent? 1 Cor.
   v. 1, 2, 6, 7; 2 Cor. ii. 6, vii. 11; Matt. xvi. 19, xviii. 15-20; Rev.
   ii. 1, 2. If he hath done none of these things, it is evident that no
   churches in this world can possibly be preserved from disorder and
   confusion. Nor can they, by love, and the fruits of a holy communion,
   be kept in such a condition as wherein he can be pleased with them, or
   continue to walk amongst them; for let men please themselves whilst
   they will with the name of the church, it is no otherwise with them
   where persons obstinately and impenitently wicked, and whose lives are
   wholly discrepant from the rule of the gospel, are suffered to abide
   without control. But if he hath made the provision inquired after in
   this case, as it is evident that he hath, both the authority he hath
   granted unto his church for these ends, his commands to exercise it
   with care and watchfulness, with the rules given them to proceed by,
   with the known end of all instituted churches for the promotion of
   holiness, being all open and plain in the Scripture, it must then be
   inquired unto whom this trust is firstly committed, and of whom these
   duties are principally required.

   For private members of the church, what is their duty, and the way how
   they may regularly attend unto the discharge of it, according to the
   mind of Christ, in case of scandalous sins and offences among them,
   they are so plainly and particularly laid down and directed, as that,
   setting aside the difficulties that are cast on the rule herein by the
   extremely forced and unprovable exceptions of some interested persons,
   none can be ignorant of what is required of them, Matt. xviii. 15-20.
   And a liberty to discharge their duty herein, they are bound by the law
   of Christ in due order to provide for. If they are abridged hereof, and
   deprived thereby of so great a means of their own edification, as also
   of the usefulness required in them towards the church whereof they are
   members, it is a spiritual oppression that they suffer under. And where
   it is voluntarily neglected by them, not only the guilt of their own,
   but of other men's sins also lies upon them. Neither is their own guilt
   small herein; for suffering sin to abide on a brother without reproof
   is a fruit of hatred in the interpretation of the law, Lev. xix. 17;
   and this hatred is a sin of a heinous nature in the sense of the
   gospel, 1 John ii. 9, 11, iii. 15. The duty, also, of the whole church
   in such cases is no less evidently declared: for from such persons as
   walk disorderly, and refuse to reform on due admonition, they are to
   withdraw, and to put from amongst them such obstinate offenders; as
   also, previously thereunto, to "watch diligently lest any root of
   bitterness spring up among them, whereby they might be defiled." And
   hereunto, also, are subservient all the commands that are given them to
   exhort and admonish one another, that the whole church may be preserved
   in purity, order, holiness, and faithfulness. But the chief inquiry is,
   With whom rests the principal care and power, according to the mind of
   Christ, to see the discipline of the church in particular congregations
   exercised, and to exercise it accordingly? If this should be found to
   be in the ministers, and, through their neglect in the administration
   of it, offenders be left in their sins and impenitency, without a due
   application of the means for their healing and recovery; if the church
   itself come to be corrupted thereby, and to fall under the displeasure
   of Jesus Christ, -- as these things, in one degree or other, more or
   less, will ensue on that neglect, -- it will not turn unto their
   comfortable account at the great day. That this is their duty, that
   this authority and inspection is committed unto them, the reasons
   before insisted on in the ease of admission do undeniably evince. And
   if those ministers who do conscientiously attend unto the discharge of
   their ministerial office towards particular flocks would but examine
   their own hearts by the light of open and plain Scripture testimonies,
   with the nature of their office, and of the work they are engaged in,
   there would need little arguing to convince them of what trust is
   committed unto them, or what is required from them. If the consciences
   of others are not concerned in these things, if they have no light into
   the duty which seems to be incumbent on them, their principles and
   practices, or as we think mistakes and neglects, can be no rule unto
   us. What we may be forbidden, what we may be hindered in, is of another
   consideration. But for us voluntarily to engage unto the omission of
   that duty, which we cannot but believe that it will be required of us,
   is an evil which we are every way obliged to avoid.

   There are also sundry particular duties, relating unto these that are
   more general, which in like manner, on the terms of communion proposed
   unto us, must be foregone and omitted. And where, by these means or
   neglects, some of the principal ways of exercising church-communion are
   cast out of the church, some of the means of the edification of its
   members are wholly lost, and sundry duties incumbent on them are
   virtually prohibited unto them, until they are utterly grown into
   disuse, it is no wonder if, in such churches where these evils are
   inveterate and remediless, particular persons do peaceably provide for
   their own edification by joining themselves unto such societies as
   wherein the rule of the gospel is more practically attended unto. It is
   taken for granted that the church is not corrupted by the wicked
   persons that are of its communion, nor its administrations defiled by
   their presence and communication in them, nor the edification of others
   prejudiced thereby, because it hath been so said by some of the
   ancients, though whether suitably unto the doctrine of the apostles or
   no is very questionable, 1 Cor. v. 6, 9-11; 2 Thess. iii. 6. But
   suppose this should be so, yet where wicked persons are admitted,
   without distinction or discrimination, unto the communion of the
   church, where they are tolerated therein, without any procedure with
   them or against them, contrary to express rules of the Scripture given
   to that purpose, so that those who are really pious among them can by
   no means prevail for the reformation of the whole, they may, not only
   without breach of charity, impairing of faith or love, or without the
   least suspicion of the guilt of schism, forsake the communion of such a
   congregation to join unto another, where there is more care of piety,
   purity, and holiness, but if they have any care of their own
   edification, and a due care of their salvation, they will understand it
   to be their duty so to do.

   And we may a little touch hereon once for all. The general end of the
   institution of churches, as such, is the visible management of the
   enmity on the part of the seed of the woman, Christ the head, and the
   members of his body mystical, against the serpent and his seed. In the
   pursuit of this end, God ever had a church in the world, separate from
   persons openly profane doing the work of the devil, their father; and
   there is nothing in any church-constitution which tends unto or is
   compliant with the mixing and reconciling these distinct seeds, whilst
   they are such, and visibly appear so to be. And therefore, as the
   types, prophecies, and promises of the Old Testament did declare that
   when all things were actually brought unto a head in Christ Jesus, the
   church and all things that belong unto it should be holy, -- that is,
   visibly so, -- so the description generally and uniformly given us of
   the churches of the New Testament when actually called and erected is,
   that they consisted of persons called, sanctified, justified, ingrafted
   into Christ, Isa. xxvi. 2; Ezek. xliii. 12, xliv. 9; or saints,
   believers, faithful ones, purified and separate unto God, Lev. xi. 44;
   Rom. i. 6; 1 Cor. i. 1, 2, xii. 13; Phil. i. 1; Col. ii. 11. Such they
   professed themselves to be, such they were judged to be by them that
   were concerned in their communion; and as such they engage themselves
   to walk in their conversation. By what authority so great a change
   should be now wrought in the nature and constitution of churches, that
   it should be altogether indifferent of what sort of persons they do
   consist, we know not. Yea, to speak plainly, we greatly fear that both
   the worship and worshippers are defiled, 2 Tim. ii. 22, where open
   impenitent sinners are freely admitted unto all sacred administrations
   without control. And we are sure that as God complaineth that his
   sanctuary is polluted, when there are brought into it "strangers,
   uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh," Ezek. xliv. 7; so
   the true members of the church are warned of the evil and dangers of
   such defiling mixtures, and charged to watch against them, 1 Cor. v. 6;
   Heb. xii. 15, 16.

   We might yet farther insist on the great evil it would be in us, if we
   should give a seeming, outward approbation unto those things and their
   use which we cannot but condemn and desire to have removed out of the
   worship of God; and, moreover, there is, as we believe, an obligation
   upon us to give a testimony unto the truth about the worship of God in
   his church, and not absolutely to hide the light we have received
   therein under a bushel. Nor would we render the reformation of the
   church absolutely hopeless, by our professed compliance with the things
   that ought to be reformed. But what hath been pleaded already is
   sufficient to manifest that there neither is nor can be a guilt of
   schism charged either on ministers or people who withhold themselves
   from the communion of that church or those churches whereof the things
   mentioned are made conditions necessary and indispensable, and that
   wherein they must be denied the liberty of performing many duties made
   necessary unto them by the command of Jesus Christ. And as the rigid
   imposition of unscriptural conditions of communion is the principal
   cause of all the schisms and divisions that are among us, so let them
   be removed and taken out of the way, and we doubt not but that among
   all that sincerely profess the gospel there may be that peace and such
   an agreement obtained, as in observance whereof they may all exercise
   those duties of love which the strictest union doth require. These we
   profess ourselves ready for so far as God shall be pleased to help us
   in the discharge of our duty; as also to renounce every principle or
   opinion whereof we may be convinced that they are in the least opposite
   unto or inconsistent with the royal law of love and the due exercise
   thereof. If men will continue to charge, accuse, or revile us, either
   out of a causeless distaste against our persons, or misunderstanding of
   our principles and ways, or upon certain reports, or merely prompted
   thereunto through a vain elation of mind, arising from the distance
   wherein, through their secular advantages, they look upon us to stand
   from them; as we cannot help it, so we shall endeavour not to be
   greatly moved at it, for it is known that this hath been the lot and
   portion of those who have gone before us in the profession of the
   gospel, and sincere endeavours to vindicate the worship of God from the
   disorders and abuses that have been introduced into it, and probably
   will be theirs who shall come after us. But the whole of our care is,
   that "in godly simplicity and sincerity we may have our conversation in
   the world, not corrupting the word of God, nor using our liberty as a
   cloak of maliciousness, but as becomes the servants of God."

   But perhaps it will yet be pleaded that this is not the whole which we
   are charged withal: for it is said that we do not only withdraw
   ourselves from the communion of the church of England, but also that we
   assemble in separate congregations for the celebration of the whole
   worship of God; whereby we evidently make a division in the church, and
   contract unto ourselves the guilt of schism, for what can there be more
   required thereunto? But what would those who make use of this objection
   have us to do? Would they have us starve our souls by a wilful neglect
   of the means appointed for their nourishment? or would they have us
   live in a constant omission of all the commands of Christ? By them, or
   those whose cause they plead, we are cast out and excluded from
   church-communion with them, by the unscriptural conditions of it which
   they would force upon us. The distance between us that ensues hereon
   they are the causes of, not we; for we are ready to join with them or
   any others upon the terms of Christ and the gospel. And do they think
   it meet that we should revenge their faults upon ourselves by a
   voluntary abstinence from all the ways and means of our edification?
   Doth any man think that Jesus Christ leaves any of his disciples unto
   such a condition as wherein it is impossible they should observe his
   commands and institutions without sin? That we should join in some
   societies, that in them we should assemble together for the worship of
   God in him, and that we should in him do and observe whatever he hath
   appointed, we look upon as our indispensable duty, made so unto us by
   his commands. "These things," say some, "you shall not do with us, if
   you will do no more; and if you do them among yourselves, you are
   schismatics." But this is a severity which we know we shall not meet
   with at the last day. We stand at the judgment-seat of Jesus Christ.

   It will, it may be, be demanded by what warrant or authority we do
   assemble ourselves in church societies, for the administration of
   gospel ordinances? and who gave us this authority? We answer, that it
   is acknowledged there is a difference between them and us, so that with
   them we cannot enjoy the worship of God; but of this difference we are
   not the cause, nor do give occasion to any blamable divisions by our
   principles or practices. Where the cause is found, there the guilt
   remains. This being the state of things with us, it is fond to imagine
   that any professors of the gospel do absolutely want a warranty or
   authority to obey Jesus Christ, to observe his commands, and to serve
   him according to his revealed will. His command in his word, his
   promise of the acceptance of them, and of his presence among them in
   all the acts of their holy obedience, the assistance and guidance of
   his Holy Spirit, which he affords graciously unto them, are a
   sufficient warranty and authority for what they do in express
   compliance with his commands; and more they will not plead a power for.
   Where the Spirit and word of Christ are, there is his authority; and
   this is no otherwise committed unto men but to enable them to act
   obedientially towards him and ministerially towards others. And were
   church actings considered more with respect unto the obedience that in
   them is performed unto Christ, which is their first and principal
   consideration, it would quickly be evident whence men might have
   authority for their performance. And by the same means are we directed
   in their order and manner. Besides, the ministers, who go before the
   people in their assemblies, are all of them (so far as we know)
   solemnly set apart unto their office and work according unto what
   Christ hath appointed; and their duty it is to teach unto all men the
   good ways of Christ, and to go before them who are convinced and
   persuaded by them in their practice. These things hath their Lord and
   Master required of them; and an account concerning them will he call
   them unto at the last day. A dispensation is committed unto them, and a
   necessity is thence incumbent on them to preach the gospel; and who
   shall excuse them if they neglect so to do? for that all those who are
   ministers of the gospel are called to preach the gospel, and that
   diligently, every one according as he hath received the gift of the
   grace of God, is out of question with them that do believe the gospel.
   And of the stewardship which is committed unto them herein are they to
   give an account; and we do know that "it is a fearful thing" for
   sinners, that is, wilful neglecters of his commands, "to fall into the
   hands of the living God." Our Lord Jesus Christ also hath testified
   beforehand that "he who setteth his hand to this plough, and looketh
   back again, is not fit for the kingdom of God." He alone who calls them
   to this work can discharge them of it, and that either by the rule of
   his word or his providence; and when men are invincibly hindered, as
   many are at this day, it is their suffering, but not their sin.
   Otherwise none can absolve them from the duty they owe to Jesus Christ
   in this matter, and that debt which they owe to the souls of men in
   undertaking the work of the ministry. Some, indeed, suppose, or pretend
   to suppose, that a prohibition given them by superiors, forbidding them
   to preach, though not by nor according unto any rule of the gospel,
   doth discharge them from any obligation so to do, that it shall be no
   more their duty. It would do so, no doubt, had they received no other
   command to preach the gospel, nor from any other authority, than that
   of and from those superiors by whom they are forbidden; but being
   persuaded that they have so from Him who is higher than the highest,
   they cannot acquiesce in this discharge, nor, being "bought with a
   price," can they now be servants of men. But by whom are they thus
   forbidden to preach? It will be supposed that the church which differs
   from them, and which originally makes itself a party in these
   differences, by the conditions of communion which it would impose upon
   them, is no competent judge in this case; nor will their prohibitions,
   who apparently thereby revenge their own quarrel, influence the
   consciences of them that dissent from them: for we speak not of what
   will or may take place, but what the consciences of men will or may be
   concerned in. By the civil magistrate they are not forbidden to preach,
   that we know of. It is true they are prohibited to preach in the legal
   public meeting-places or churches; and these places being in the power
   and care of the magistrate, it is meet his terms and conditions of
   their use should be accepted of, or his prohibition observed, or his
   penalty quietly undergone, where a peaceable occasion is made use of
   contrary unto it. As to other places, ministers are not absolutely
   forbid to preach in them, -- no such power is as yet assumed or
   exercised; only, the manner of assemblies for sacred worship, and the
   number of them that may assemble, are regulated by laws for secular
   ends or civil security, and that under express penalties incurred on a
   contrary practice. But the consciences of ministers cannot be concerned
   in such laws, so far as to be exempted by them from the obligation that
   lies upon them from the command of Christ to preach the gospel. This
   they are commanded by him to do, and others know the penalties from
   men, under the danger whereof they must attend unto them. Besides, the
   reasons of these legal prohibitions, so far as they do extend, are
   taken from civil considerations alone, -- namely, of the peace and
   quiet of the nation, -- and not from any scripture or religious rules.
   And were these prohibitions only temporary or occasional, suited unto
   such emergencies as may give countenance unto their necessity, there
   might be a proportionable compliance with them. But whereas they
   respect all times alike, it is no doubt incumbent on them who act any
   thing contrary unto such prohibitions to secure their own consciences
   that they no way interfere with the intention and end of the law, by
   giving the least countenance or occasion unto civil disturbances; and
   others, also, by their peaceable deportment in all they do. But whereas
   they have received a talent from the Lord Christ to trade withal, have
   accepted of his terms and engaged into his service, without any
   condition of exception in case of such prohibitions, it is not possible
   they should satisfy their consciences in desisting from their work on
   such occurrences, any farther than in what they must yield unto outward
   force and necessity. It is pretended by some that if such a legal
   prohibition were given unto all the ministers of the gospel, it would
   not be obligatory unto them; for if it should be so esteemed, it were
   in the power of any supreme magistrate lawfully to forbid the whole
   work of preaching the gospel unto his subjects, which is contrary to
   the grant made by God the Father unto Jesus Christ, that "all nations
   shall be his inheritance," and the commission he gave thereon unto his
   apostles, to "teach all nations," and to "preach the gospel to every
   creature" under heaven: but it being some only that are concerned in
   this prohibition, it is their duty, for peace' sake, to acquiesce in
   the will of their superiors therein, whilst there are others sufficient
   to carry on the same work. That peace is or may be secured on other
   terms hath been already declared; but that one man's liberty to attend
   unto his duty, and his doing it accordingly, should excuse another from
   that which is personally incumbent on himself, is a matter not easily
   apprehended, nor can be readily digested. Besides, what is pretended of
   the sufficient number of preachers, without any contribution of aid
   from the Nonconformists, is indeed but pretended; for if all that are
   found in the faith, gifted and called to the work of the ministry, in
   these nations, were equally encouraged unto and in their work, yet
   would they not be able to answer the necessities of the souls of men
   requiring an attendance unto it in a due measure and manner: and those
   who have exercised themselves unto compassionate thoughts towards the
   multitudes of poor sinners in these nations will not be otherwise
   minded. Wherefore, these things being premised, we shall shut up these
   discourses with a brief answer unto the foregoing objection, which was
   the occasion of them; and we say, --

   1. That schism being the name of a sin, or somewhat that is evil, it
   can in no circumstances be any man's duty. But we have manifested, as
   satisfactorily unto our own consciences, so we hope unto the minds of
   unprejudiced persons, that in our present condition our assemblies for
   the worship of God are our express duty; and so can have no affinity
   with any sin or evil. And those who intend to charge us with schism in
   or for our assemblies must first prove them not to be our duty.

   2. Notwithstanding them, or any thing by us performed in them, we do
   preserve our communion entire with the church of England (that is, all
   the visible professors of the gospel in this nation), as it is a part
   of the catholic church, in the unity of the faith owned therein,
   provided it be not measured by the present opinions of some who have
   evidently departed from it. Our non-admittance of the present
   government and discipline of the church, as apprehended national, and
   as it is in the hands of merely ecclesiastical persons, or such as are
   pretended so to be, we have accounted for before. But we are one with
   the whole body of the professors of the protestant religion, in a
   public avowment of the same faith.

   3. Into particular churches we neither are nor can be admitted, but on
   those terms and conditions which not only we may justly, but which we
   are bound in a way of duty to refuse; and this also hath been pleaded
   before. Besides, no man is so obliged unto communion with any
   particular or parochial church in this nation, but that it is in his
   own power at any time to relinquish it, and to secure himself also from
   all laws which may respect that communion, by the removal of his
   habitation. It is therefore evident that we never had any relation unto
   any parochial church but what is civil and arbitrary, a relinquishment
   whereof is practised at pleasure every day by all sorts of men.
   Continuing, therefore, in the constant profession of the same faith
   with all other Protestants in the nation, and the whole body thereof as
   united in the profession of it under one civil or political head; and
   having antecedently no evangelical obligation upon us unto local
   communion in the same ordinances of worship numerically with any
   particular or parochial church; and being prohibited from any such
   communion, by the terms, conditions, and customs indispensably annexed
   unto it by the laws of the land and the church, which are not lawful
   for us to observe, being Christ's freemen; it being, moreover, our duty
   to assemble ourselves in societies for the celebration of the worship
   of God in Christ, as that which is expressly commanded; -- we are
   abundantly satisfied that, however we may be censured, judged, or
   condemned by men in and for what we do, yet that He doth both accept us
   here and will acquit us hereafter whom we serve and seek in all things
   to obey. Wherefore, we are not convinced that any principle or practice
   which we own or allow is in any thing contrary to that love, peace, and
   unity which the Lord Christ requireth to be kept and preserved among
   his disciples, or those that profess faith in him and obedience unto
   him according to the gospel. We know not any thing in them but what is
   consistent and compliant with that evangelical union which ought to be
   in and among the churches of Christ; the terms whereof we are ready to
   hold and observe even with them that in sundry things differ from us;
   as we shall endeavour, also, to exercise all duties of the same love,
   peaceableness, and gentleness towards them by whom we are hated and
   reviled.
