Chapter 1

   1:1 The Title is simply Acts [Praxeis] in Aleph, Origen, Tertullian,
   Didymus, Hilary, Eusebius, Epiphanius. The Acts of the Apostles
   [Praxeis apostolOn] is the reading of B D (Aleph in subscription)
   Athanasius, Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian, Eusebius, Cyril of Jerusalem,
   Theodoret, Hilary. The Acts of the Holy Apostles [Praxeis tOn hagiOn
   apostolOn] is read by A2 E G H A K Chrysostom. It is possible that the
   book was given no title at all by Luke, for it is plain that usage
   varied greatly even in the same writers. The long title as found in the
   Textus Receptus (Authorized Version) is undoubtedly wrong with the
   adjective "Holy." The reading of B D, "The Acts of the Apostles," may
   be accepted as probably correct.

   The former treatise [ton men prOton]. Literally, the first treatise.
   The use of the superlative is common enough and by no means implies,
   though it allows, a third volume. This use of [prOtos] where only two
   are compared is seen between the Baptist and Jesus (Joh 1:15), John and
   Peter (Joh 20:4). The idiom is common in the papyri (Robertson,
   Grammar, pp. 662, 669). The use of [men solitarium] here, as Hackett
   notes, is common in Acts. It is by no means true that [men] requires a
   following [de] by contrast. The word is merely a weakened form of [men]
   = surely, indeed. The reference is to the "first treatise" and merely
   emphasizes that. The use of [logos] (word) for treatise or historical
   narrative is common in ancient Greek as in Herodotus 6 and 9. Plato
   (Phaedo, p. 61 B) makes a contrast between [muthos] and [logos]. I made
   [epoiesamen]. Aorist middle indicative, the middle being the usual
   construction for mental acts with [poieO]. O Theophilus [O Theophile].
   The interjection [O] here as is common, though not in Lu 1:3. But the
   adjective [kratiste] (most excellent) is wanting here. See remarks on
   Theophilus on Lu 1:3. Hackett thinks that he lived at Rome because of
   the way Acts ends. He was a man of rank. He may have defrayed the
   expense of publishing both Luke and Acts. Perhaps by this time Luke may
   have reached a less ceremonious acquaintance with Theophilus. Which
   Jesus began [hOn erxato Iesous]. The relative is attracted from the
   accusative [ha] to the genitive [hOn] because of the antecedent
   [pantOn] (all). The language of Luke here is not merely pleonastic as
   Winer held. Jesus "began" "both to do and to teach" [poiein te kai
   didaskein]. Note present infinitives, linear action, still going on,
   and the use of [te--kai] binds together the life and teachings of
   Jesus, as if to say that Jesus is still carrying on from heaven the
   work and teaching of the disciples which he started while on earth
   before his ascension. The record which Luke now records is really the
   Acts of Jesus as much as the Acts of the Apostles. Dr. A. T. Pierson
   called it "The Acts of the Holy Spirit," and that is true also. The
   Acts, according to Luke, is a continuation of the doings and teachings
   of Jesus. "The following writings appear intended to give us, and do,
   in fact, profess to give us, that which Jesus continued to do and teach
   after the day in which he was taken up" (Bernard, Progress of Doctrine
   in the N.T.).

   1:2 Until the day in which [achri hes hemeras]. Incorporation of the
   antecedent into the relative clause and the change of case [hei]
   (locative) to [hes] (genitive). Was received up [anelempthe]. First
   aorist passive indicative of [analambanO]. Common verb to lift anything
   up (Ac 10:16) or person as Paul (Ac 20:13). Several times of the
   Ascension of Jesus to heaven (Mr 16:19; Ac 1:2, 11, 22; 1Ti 3:16) with
   or without "into heaven" [eis ton ouranon]. This same verb is used of
   Elijah's translation to heaven in the LXX (2Ki 2:11). The same idea,
   though not this word, is in Lu 24:51. See Lu 9:51 for [analempsis] of
   the Ascension. Had given commandment [enteilamenos]. First aorist
   middle participle of [entellO] (from [en] and [tellO], to accomplish),
   usually in the middle, old verb, to enjoin. This special commandment
   refers directly to what we call the commission given the apostles
   before Christ ascended on high (Joh 20:21-23; Mt 28:16-20; Mr 16:15-18;
   1Co 15:6; Lu 24:44-49). He had given commands to them when they were
   first chosen and when they were sent out on the tour of Galilee, but
   the immediate reference is as above. Through the Holy Spirit [dia
   pneumatos hagiou]. In his human life Jesus was under the guidance of
   the Holy Spirit. This applies to the choice of the apostles (Lu 6:13)
   and to these special commands before the Ascension. Whom he had chosen
   [hous exelexato]. Aorist middle indicative, not past perfect. The same
   verb [eklexamenos] was used by Luke in describing the choice of the
   twelve by Jesus (Lu 6:13). But the aorist does not stand "for" our
   English pluperfect as Hackett says. That is explaining Greek by
   English. The Western text here adds: "And ordered to proclaim the
   gospel."

   1:3 To whom also [hois kai]. He chose them and then also manifested
   himself to these very same men that they might have personal witness to
   give. Shewed himself alive [parestesen heauton zOnta]. To the disciples
   the first Sunday evening (Mr 16:14; Lu 24:36-43; Joh 20:19-25), the
   second Sunday evening (Joh 20:26-29), at the Sea of Tiberias (Joh
   21:1-23), on the mountain in Galilee (Mt 28:16-20; Mr 16:15-18; 1Co
   15:6), to the disciples in Jerusalem and Olivet (Lu 24:44-53; Mr
   16-19f.; Ac 1:1-11). Luke uses this verb [paristemi] 13 times in the
   Acts both transitively and intransitively. It is rendered by various
   English words (present, furnish, provide, assist, commend). The early
   disciples including Paul never doubted the fact of the Resurrection,
   once they were convinced by personal experience. At first some doubted
   like Thomas (Mr 16:14; Lu 24:41; Joh 20:24f.; Mt 28:17). But after that
   they never wavered in their testimony to their own experience with the
   Risen Christ, "whereof we are witnesses" Peter said (Ac 3:15). They
   doubted at first, that we may believe, but at last they risked life
   itself in defence of this firm faith. After his passion [meta to
   pathein auton]. Neat Greek idiom, [meta] with the articular infinitive
   (second aorist active of [paschO] and the accusative of general
   reference, "after the suffering as to him." For [pathein] used
   absolutely of Christ's suffering see also Ac 17:3; 26:23. By many
   proofs [en pollois tekmeriois]. Literally, "in many proofs."
   [Tekmerion] is only here in the N.T., though an old and common word in
   ancient Greek and occurring in the Koine (papyri, etc.). The verb
   [tekmairO], to prove by sure signs, is from [tekmar], a sign. Luke does
   not hesitate to apply the definite word "proofs" to the evidence for
   the Resurrection of Christ after full investigation on the part of this
   scientific historian. Aristotle makes a distinction between [tekmerion]
   (proof) and [semeion] (sign) as does Galen the medical writer.
   Appearing [optanomenos]. Present middle participle from late verb
   [optanO], late Koine verb from root [optO] seen in [opsomai, Ophthen].
   In LXX, papyri of second century B.C. (Deissmann, Light from the
   Ancient East, p. 83). Only here in the N.T. For [optasia] for vision
   see Ac 26:19; Lu 1:22; 24:23. By the space of forty days [di' hemerOn
   tesserakonta]. At intervals [dia], between) during the forty days, ten
   appearances being known to us. Jesus was not with them continually now
   in bodily presence. The period of forty days is given here alone. The
   Ascension was thus ten days before Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came.
   Moses was in the mount forty days (Ex 24:18) and Jesus fasted forty
   days (Mt 4:2). In the Gospel of Luke 24 this separation of forty days
   between the Resurrection and the Ascension is not drawn. The things
   concerning the Kingdom of God [ta peri tes basileias tou theou]. This
   phrase appears 33 times in Luke's Gospel, 15 times in Mark, 4 times in
   Matthew who elsewhere has "the kingdom of heaven," once in John, and 6
   times in Acts. No essential distinction is to be drawn between the two
   for the Jews often used "heaven" rather than "God" to avoid using the
   Tetragrammaton. But it is noticeable how the word kingdom drops out of
   Acts. Other words like gospel [euaggelion] take the place of "kingdom."
   Jesus was fond of the word "kingdom" and Luke is fond of the idiom "the
   things concerning" [ta peri]. Certainly with Jesus the term "kingdom"
   applies to the present and the future and covers so much that it is not
   strange that the disciples with their notions of a political Messianic
   kingdom (Ac 1:6) were slow to comprehend the spiritual nature of the
   reign of God.

   1:4 Being assembled together with them [sunalizomenos]. Present passive
   participle from [sunalizO], an old verb in Herodotus, Xenophon, etc.,
   from sun, with, and [halizO], from [hales], crowded. The margin of both
   the Authorized and the Revised Versions has "eating with them" as if
   from [sun] and [hals] (salt). Salt was the mark of hospitality. There
   is the verb [halisthete en autOi] used by Ignatius Ad Magnes. X, "Be ye
   salted in him." But it is more than doubtful if that is the idea here
   though the Vulgate does have convescens illis "eating with them," as if
   that was the common habit of Jesus during the forty days (Wendt, Feine,
   etc.). Jesus did on occasion eat with the disciples (Lu 24:41-43; Mr
   16:14). To wait for the promise of the Father [perimenein ten
   epaggelian tou patros]. Note present active infinitive, to keep on
   waiting for (around, [peri]. In the Great Commission on the mountain in
   Galilee this item was not given (Mt 28:16-20). It is the subjective
   genitive, the promise given by the Father (note this Johannine use of
   the word), that is the Holy Spirit ("the promise of the Holy Spirit,"
   objective genitive). Which ye heard from me [hen ekousate mou]. Change
   from indirect discourse (command), infinitives [chOrizesthai] and
   [perimenein] after [pareggeilen] to direct discourse without any [ephe]
   (said he) as the English (Italics). Luke often does this (oratior
   ariata). Note also the ablative case of [mou] (from me). Luke continues
   in verse 5 with the direct discourse giving the words of Jesus.

   1:5 Baptized with water [ebaptisen hudati] and with the Holy Ghost [en
   pneumati baptisthesesthe hagiOi]. The margin has "in the Holy Ghost"
   (Spirit, it should be). The American Standard Version renders "in" both
   with "water" and "Holy Spirit" as do Goodspeed (American Translation)
   and Mrs. Montgomery (Centenary Translation). John's own words (Mt 3:11)
   to which Jesus apparently refers use [en] (in) both with water and
   Spirit. There is a so-called instrumental use of [en] where we in
   English have to say "with" (Re 13:10 [en machairei], like [machairei],
   Ac 12:2). That is to say [en] with the locative presents the act as
   located in a certain instrument like a sword (Robertson, Grammar, pp.
   589f.). But the instrumental case is more common without [en] (the
   locative and instrumental cases having the same form). So it is often a
   matter of indifference which idiom is used as in Joh 21:8 we have [tOi
   ploiariOi] (locative without [en]. They came in (locative case without
   [en] the boat. So in Joh 1:31 [en hudati baptizOn] baptizing in water.
   No distinction therefore can be insisted on here between the
   construction [hudati] and [en pneumati] (both being in the locative
   case, one without, one with [en]. Note unusual position of the verb
   [baptisthesesthe] (future passive indicative) between [pneumati] and
   [hagiOi]. This baptism of the Holy Spirit was predicted by John (Mt
   3:11) as the characteristic of the Messiah's work. Now the Messiah
   himself in his last message before his Ascension proclaims that in a
   few days the fulfilment of that prophecy will come to pass. The Codex
   Bezae adds here "which ye are about to receive" and "until the
   Pentecost" to verse 5. Not many days hence [ou meta pollas tautas
   hemeras]. A neat Greek idiom difficult to render smoothly into English:
   "Not after many days these." The litotes (not many=few) is common in
   Luke (Lu 7:6; 15:13; Ac 17:27; 19:11; 20:12; 21:39; 28:14; 28:2). The
   predicate use of [tautas] (without article) is to be noted. "These"
   really means as a starting point, "from these" (Robertson, Grammar, p.
   702). It was ten days hence. This idiom occurs several times in Luke
   (Lu 24:21; Ac 24:21), as elsewhere (Joh 4:18; 2Pe 3:1). In Lu 2:12 the
   copula is easily supplied as it exists in Lu 1:36; 2:2.

   1:6 They therefore [hoi men oun]. Demonstrative use of [hoi] with [men
   oun] without any corresponding [de] just as in 1:1 [men] occurs alone.
   The combination [men oun] is common in Acts (27 times). Cf. Lu 3:18.
   The [oun] is resumptive and refers to the introductory verses (1:1-5),
   which served to connect the Acts with the preceding Gospel. The
   narrative now begins. Asked [erOtOn]. Imperfect active, repeatedly
   asked before Jesus answered. Lord [kurie]. Here not in the sense of
   "sir" (Mt 21:30), but to Jesus as Lord and Master as often in Acts
   (19:5, 10, etc.) and in prayer to Jesus (7:59). Dost thou restore [ei
   apokathistaneis]. The use of [ei] in an indirect question is common. We
   have already seen its use in direct questions (Mt 12:10; Lu 13:23 which
   see for discussion), possibly in imitation of the Hebrew (frequent in
   the LXX) or as a partial condition without conclusion. See also Ac 7:1;
   19:2; 21:37; 22:25. The form of the verb [apokathistanO] is late (also
   [apokathistaO] omega form for the old and common [apokathistemi],
   double compound, to restore to its former state. As a matter of fact
   the Messianic kingdom for which they are asking is a political kingdom
   that would throw off the hated Roman yoke. It is a futuristic present
   and they are uneasy that Jesus may yet fail to fulfil their hopes.
   Surely here is proof that the eleven apostles needed the promise of the
   Father before they began to spread the message of the Risen Christ.
   They still yearn for a political kingdom for Israel even after faith
   and hope have come back. They need the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit
   (Joh 14-16) and the power of the Holy Spirit (Ac 1:4f.).

   1:7 Times or seasons [chronous e kairous]. "Periods" and "points" of
   time sometimes and probably so here, but such a distinction is not
   always maintained. See Ac 17:26 for [kairous] in the same sense as
   [chronous] for long periods of time. But here some distinction seems to
   be called for. It is curious how eager people have always been to fix
   definite dates about the second coming of Christ as the apostles were
   about the political Messianic kingdom which they were expecting. Hath
   set [etheto]. Second aorist middle indicative, emphasizing the
   sovereignty of the Father in keeping all such matters to himself, a
   gentle hint to people today about the limits of curiosity. Note also
   "his own" [idiai] "authority" [exousiai].

   1:8 Power [dunamin]. Not the "power" about which they were concerned
   (political organization and equipments for empire on the order of
   Rome). Their very question was ample proof of their need of this new
   "power" [dunamin], to enable them (from [dunamai], to be able), to
   grapple with the spread of the gospel in the world. When the Holy Ghost
   is come upon you [epelthontos tou hagiou pneumatos eph' humas].
   Genitive absolute and is simultaneous in time with the preceding verb
   "shall receive" [lempsesthe]. The Holy Spirit will give them the
   "power" as he comes upon them. This is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
   referred to in verse 5. My witnesses [mou martures]. Correct text.
   "Royal words of magnificent and Divine assurance" (Furneaux). Our word
   martyrs is this word [martures]. In Lu 24:48 Jesus calls the disciples
   "witnesses to these things" [martures toutOn], objective genitive). In
   Ac 1:22 an apostle has to be a "witness to the Resurrection" of Christ
   and in 10:39 to the life and work of Jesus. Hence there could be no
   "apostles" in this sense after the first generation. But here the
   apostles are called "my witnesses." "His by a direct personal
   relationship" (Knowling). The expanding sphere of their witness when
   the Holy Spirit comes upon them is "unto the uttermost part of the
   earth" [heOs eschatou tes ges]. Once they had been commanded to avoid
   Samaria (Mt 10:5), but now it is included in the world program as
   already outlined on the mountain in Galilee (Mt 28:19; Mr 16:15). Jesus
   is on Olivet as he points to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, the uttermost
   (last, [eschatou] part of the earth. The program still beckons us on to
   world conquest for Christ. "The Acts themselves form the best
   commentary on these words, and the words themselves might be given as
   the best summary of the Acts" (Page). The events follow this outline
   (Jerusalem till the end of chapter 7, with the martyrdom of Stephen,
   the scattering of the saints through Judea and Samaria in chapter 8,
   the conversion of Saul, chapter 9, the spread of the gospel to Romans
   in Caesarea by Peter (chapter 10), to Greeks in Antioch (chapter 11),
   finally Paul's world tours and arrest and arrival in Rome(chapters 11
   to 28).

   1:9 As they were looking [blepontOn autOn]. Genitive absolute. The
   present participle accents the fact that they were looking directly at
   Jesus. He was taken up (eperthe). First aorist passive indicative of
   [epairO], old and common verb meaning to lift up. In Lu 24:51 we have
   "he was borne up" [anephereto] and in Ac 1:2; 1:11; 1Ti 3:6 "was
   received up" [anelempthe]. Received [hupelaben]. Second aorist active
   indicative of [hupolambanO], literally here "took under him." He seemed
   to be supported by the cloud. "In glory" Paul adds in 1Ti 3:16. Out of
   their sight [apo tOn ophthalmOn autOn]. From their eyes [apo] with
   ablative case).

   1:10 Were looking steadfastly [atenizontes esan]. Periphrastic
   imperfect active of [atenizO], a late intensive verb (intensive [a] and
   [teinO], to stretch). Common in Acts and also in Lu 4:20; 22:56 as well
   as Ac 10:4, which see. As he went [poreuomenou autou]. Genitive
   absolute of present middle participle. They saw him slipping away from
   their eyes as the cloud bore him away. Stood by them [pareistekeisan
   autois]. Past perfect active indicative of [paristemi] and intransitive
   (note [i] in B instead of [ei] for augment, mere itacism).

   1:11 Who also [hoi kai]. Common use of [kai] pleonastic to show that
   the two events were parallel. This is the simplest way from Homer on to
   narrate two parallel events. Why? [ti]. Jesus had told them of his
   coming Ascension (Joh 6:62; 20:17) so that they should have been
   prepared. This Jesus [houtos ho Iesous]. Qui vobis fuit eritque semper
   Jesus, id est, Salvator (Corn. a Lapide). The personal name assures
   them that Jesus will always be in heaven a personal friend and divine
   Saviour (Knowling). So in like manner [houtOs hon tropon]. Same idea
   twice. "So in which manner" (incorporation of antecedent and accusative
   of general reference). The fact of his second coming and the manner of
   it also described by this emphatic repetition.

   1:12 Olivet [ElaiOnos]. Genitive singular. Vulgate Olivetum. Made like
   [ampelOn]. Here only in the N.T., usually [to oros tOn ElaiOn] (the
   Mount of Olives), though some MSS. have Olivet in Lu 19:29; 21:37.
   Josephus (Ant. VII. 9, 2) has it also and the papyri (Deissmann, Light
   from the Ancient East, p. 170). A sabbath day's journey off [Sabbatou
   echOn hodon]. Luke only says here that Olivet is a Sabbath day's
   journey from Jerusalem, not that Jesus was precisely that distance when
   he ascended. In the Gospel Luke (24:50) states that Jesus led them
   "over against" [heOs pros] Bethany (about two miles or fifteen
   furlongs). The top of Olivet is six furlongs or three-fourths of a
   mile. The Greek idiom here is "having a journey of a Sabbath" after
   "which is nigh unto Jerusalem" [ho estin eggus Ierousalem], note the
   periphrastic construction. Why Luke mentions this item for Gentile
   readers in this form is not known, unless it was in his Jewish source.
   See Ex 16:29; Nu 35:5; Jos 3:4. But it does not contradict what he says
   in Lu 24:50, where he does not say that Jesus led them all the way to
   Bethany.

   1:13 Into the upper chamber [eis to huperOion]. The upstairs or upper
   room [huper] is upper or over, the adjective [huperOios], the room
   upstairs where the women staid in Homer, then a room up under the flat
   roof for retirement or prayer (Ac 9:37, 39), sometimes a large third
   story room suitable for gatherings (Ac 20:9). It is possible, even
   probable, that this is the "large upper room" [anOgeon mega] of Mr
   14:15; Lu 22:12. The Vulgate has coenaculum for both words. The word is
   used in the N.T. only in Acts. It was in a private house as in Lu 22:11
   and not in the temple as Lu 24:53 might imply, "continually" [dia
   pantos] these words probably meaning on proper occasions. They were
   abiding [esan katamenontes]. Periphrastic imperfect active. Perfective
   use of [kata], to abide permanently. It is possible that this is the
   house of Mary the mother of John Mark where the disciples later met for
   prayer (Ac 12:12). Here alone in the N.T., though old compound. Some
   MSS. here read [paramenontes]. This could mean constant residence, but
   most likely frequent resort for prayer during these days, some being on
   hand all the time as they came and went. Simon the Zealot [Simon ho
   ZelOtes]. Called Simon the Cananaean [ho Cananaios] in Mt 10:4, Mr
   3:18, but Zealot in Lu 6:16 as here giving the Greek equivalent of the
   Aramaic word because Luke has Gentiles in mind. The epithet (member of
   the party of Zealots) clung to him after he became an apostle and
   distinguishes him from Simon Peter. See Vol. I on the Gospel of Matthew
   for discussion of the four lists of the apostles. Judas the son of
   James [Joudas IakObou]. Literally, Judas of James, whether son or
   brother (cf. Jude 1:1) we do not really know. "Of James" is added to
   distinguish him from Judas Iscariot (Joh 14:22). However we take it, he
   must be identified with the Thaddaeus (=Lebbaeus) of Mark and Matthew
   to make the list in the third group identical. No name appears in Acts
   for that of Judas Iscariot.

   1:14 With one accord [homothumadon]. Old adverb in [-don] from
   adjective [homothumos] and that from [homos], same, and [thumos], mind
   or spirit, with the same mind or spirit. Common in ancient Greek and
   papyri. In the N.T. eleven times in Acts and nowhere else save Ro 15:6.
   See Mt 18:19. Continued [esan proskarterountes]. Periphrastic imperfect
   active of [proskartereO], old verb from [pros] (perfective use) and
   [kartereO] from [karteros], strong, steadfast, like the English "carry
   on." Already in Mr 3:9 which see and several times in Acts and Paul's
   Epistles. They "stuck to" the praying [tei proseuchei], note article)
   for the promise of the Father till the answer came. With the women [sun
   gunaixin]. Associative instrumental case plural of [gune] after [sun].
   As one would expect when praying was the chief work on hand. More women
   certainly included than in Lu 8:2; Mr 15:40f.; Mt 27:55f.; Lu 23:49; Mr
   15:47; Mt 27:61; Lu 23:55f.; Mr 16:1; Mt 28:1; Lu 24:1f.; Joh 20:1,
   11-18; Mt 28:9f. There were probably other women also whose testimony
   was no longer scouted as it had been at first. Codex Bezae adds here
   "and children." And Mary the mother of Jesus [kai Mariam tei metri tou
   Iesou]. A delicate touch by Luke that shows Mary with her crown of
   glory at last. She had come out of the shadow of death with the song in
   her heart and with the realization of the angel's promise and the
   prophecy of Simeon. It was a blessed time for Mary. With his brethren
   [sun tois adelphois autou]. With his brothers, it should be translated.
   They had once disbelieved in him (Joh 7:5). Jesus had appeared to James
   (1Co 15:7) and now it is a happy family of believers including the
   mother and brothers (half-brothers, literally) of Jesus. They continue
   in prayer for the power from on high.

   1:15 Brethren [adelphOn]. Codex Bezae has "disciples." Multitude of
   persons [ochlos onomatOn]. Literally, multitude of names. This
   Hebraistic use of [onoma] = person occurs in the LXX (Nu 1:2; 18:20;
   3:40, 43; 26:53) and in Re 3:4; 11:13. Together [epi to auto]. The word
   "gathered" is not in the Greek here, but it does occur in Mt 22:34 and
   that is undoubtedly the idea in Lu 17:35 as in Ac 2:1, 44, 47; 1Co
   11:20; 14:23. So also here. They were in the same place [to auto].
   About a hundred and twenty [hOs hekaton eikosi]. A crowd for "the upper
   room." No special significance in the number 120, just the number
   there.

   1:16 Brethren [andres adelphoi]. Literally, men, brethren or brother
   men. More dignified and respectful than just "brethren." Demosthenes
   sometimes said [Andres Athenaioi]. Cf. our "gentlemen and
   fellow-citizens." Women are included in this address though [andres]
   refers only to men. It was needful [edei]. Imperfect tense of the
   impersonal [dei] with the infinitive clause (first aorist passive) and
   the accusative of general reference as a loose subject. Peter here
   assumes that Jesus is the Messiah and finds scripture illustrative of
   the treachery of Judas. He applies it to Judas and quotes the two
   passages in verse 20 (Ps 69:25; 109:8). The Holy Spirit has not yet
   come upon them, but Peter feels moved to interpret the situation. He
   feels that his mind is opened by Jesus (Lu 24:45). It is a logical, not
   a moral, necessity that Peter points out. Peter here claims the Holy
   Spirit as speaking in the scriptures as he does in 2Pe 1:21. His
   description of Judas as "guide" [hodegou] to those who seized
   [sullabousin] Jesus is that of the base traitor that he was. This very
   verb occurs in Lu 22:54 of the arrest of Jesus.

   1:17 Was numbered [katerithmenos en]. Periphrastic past perfect passive
   indicative of [katarithmeO], old verb, but here only in the N.T.
   (perfective use of [kata]. Received his portion [elachen ton kleron].
   Second aorist active indicative of [lagchanO], old verb, to obtain by
   lot as in Lu 1:9; Joh 19:24, especially by divine appointment as here
   and 2Pe 2:1. [Kleros] also means lot, an object used in casting lots
   (Ac 1:26), or what is obtained by lot as here and 8:21, of eternal
   salvation (Ac 26:18; Col 1:12), of persons chosen by divine appointment
   (1Pe 5:3). From this latter usage the Latin cleros, clericus, our
   clergy, one chosen by divine lot. So Peter says that Judas "obtained by
   lot the lot of this ministry" [diakonias] which he had when he betrayed
   Jesus. The Master chose him and gave him his opportunity.

   1:18 Now this man [Houtos men oun]. Note [men oun] again without a
   corresponding [de] as in 1:6. Verses 18, 19 are a long parenthesis of
   Luke by way of explanation of the fate of Judas. In verse 20 Peter
   resumes and quotes the scripture to which he referred in verse 16.
   Obtained [ektesato]. First aorist middle indicative of [ktaomai], to
   acquire, only in the middle, to get for oneself. With the covenant
   money for the betrayal, acquired it indirectly apparently according to
   Mt 26:14-16; 27:3-8 which see. Falling headlong [prenes genomenos].
   Attic form usually [pranes]. The word means, not "headlong," but "flat
   on the face" as opposed to [huptios] on the back (Hackett). Hackett
   observes that the place suits admirably the idea that Judas hung
   himself (Mt 27:5) and, the rope breaking, fell flat on his face and
   burst asunder in the midst [elakesen mesos]. First aorist active
   indicative of [laskO] old verb (here only in the N.T.), to clang, to
   crack, to crash, like a falling tree. Aristophanes uses it of crashing
   bones. [Mesos] is predicate nominative referring to Judas. Gushed out
   [exechuthe]. First aorist passive indicative of [ekcheO], to pour out.

   1:19 Language [dialektOi]. Not a dialect of the Greek, but a different
   language, the Aramaic. So also in 2:6; 21:40. [Dialektos] is from
   [dialegomai], to converse, to speak between two [dia]. Akeldama
   [Hakeldamach]. This Aramaic word Peter explains as "the field of
   blood." Two traditions are preserved: one in Mt 27:7 which explains
   that the priests purchased this potter's field with the money which
   Judas flung down as the price of the blood of Jesus. The other in Acts
   describes it as the field of blood because Judas poured out his blood
   there. Hackett and Knowling argue that both views can be true. "The
   ill-omened name could be used with a double emphasis" (Hackett).

   1:20 For it is written [gegraptai gar]. Luke here returns to the
   address of Peter interrupted by verses 18, 19. Perfect passive
   indicative, the usual idiom in quoting scripture, stands written. Ps 69
   is often quoted as Messianic in Matthew and John. His habitation [he
   epaulis autou]. Only here in the N.T., a country house, cottage, cabin.
   His office [ten episkopen autou]. Our word bishopric (Authorized
   Version) is from this word, office of bishop [episcopos]. Only that is
   not the idea here, but over-seership [epi, skopeO] or office as in 1Pe
   2:12. It means to visit and to inspect, to look over. The
   ecclesiastical sense comes later (1Ti 3:1).

   1:21 Must [dei]. Present necessity corresponding to the old necessity
   [edei] about Judas (verse 16). This sentence in verses 21, 22 begins
   with [dei]. That [hOi]. Locative case of the relative attracted to the
   case of the antecedent. Went in and went out [eiselthen kai exelthen].
   Constative aorist active. With us [eph' hemas]. Over us, the margin has
   it. But the full phrase would be [eph' hemas kai aph' hemOn]. He came
   to us and went from us (Knowling).

   1:22 Beginning [arxamenos]. Aorist middle participle of [archO],
   agreeing (nominative) with [ho kurios Iesous] (the Lord Jesus). The
   ministry of Jesus began with the ministry of John. Strictly speaking
   [arxamenos] should be the accusative and agree with [martura] (witness)
   in verse 22, but the construction is a bit free. The ministry of Jesus
   began with the baptism of John and lasted until the Ascension. A
   witness with us of his resurrection [martura tes anastaseOs autou sun
   hemin]. This Peter considers the essential thing in a successor to
   Judas. The one chosen should be a personal witness who can speak from
   his own experience of the ministry, resurrection, and ascension of the
   Lord Jesus. One can easily see that this qualification will soon put an
   end to those who bear such personal testimony.

   1:23 They put forward two [estesan duo]. First aorist active indicative
   (transitive) of [histemi] (not intransitive second aorist, though same
   form in the third person plural). Somebody nominated two names, Justus
   and Matthias.

   1:24 Show us the one whom thou hast chosen [anadeixon hon exelexO].
   First aorist active imperative of [anadeiknumi], to show up, make
   plain. First aorist middle indicative second person singular of
   [eklegO], to pick out, choose, select. In this prayer they assume that
   God has made a choice. They only wish to know his will. They call God
   the heart-searcher or heart-knower [kardiognOsta], vocative singular),
   a late word, here and Ac 15:8 only in the N.T. Modern physicians have
   delicate apparatus for studying the human heart.

   1:25 Apostleship [apostoles]. Jesus had called the twelve apostles. An
   old word for sending away, then for a release, then the office and
   dignity of an apostle (Ac 1:25; Ro 1:5; 1Co 9:2; Gal 2:8). To his own
   place [eis ton topon ton idion]. A bold and picturesque description of
   the destiny of Judas worthy of Dante's Inferno. There is no doubt in
   Peter's mind of the destiny of Judas nor of his own guilt. He made
   ready his own berth and went to it.

   1:26 He was numbered [sunkatepsephisthe]. To the Jews the lot did not
   suggest gambling, but "the O.T. method of learning the will of Jehovah"
   (Furneaux). The two nominations made a decision necessary and they
   appealed to God in this way. This double compound [sunkatapsephizO]
   occurs here alone in the N.T. and elsewhere only in Plutarch (Them. 21)
   in the middle voice for condemning with others. [SunpsephizO] occurs in
   the middle voice in Ac 19:19 for counting up money and also in
   Aristophanes. [PsephizO] with [dapanen] occurs in Lu 14:28 for counting
   the cost and in Re 13:18 for "counting" the number of the beast. The
   ancients used pebbles [psephoi] in voting, black for condemning, white
   (Re 2:17) in acquitting. Here it is used in much the same sense as
   [katarithmeO] in verse 17.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2

   2:1 Was now come [en tOi sunplerousthai]. Luke's favourite idiom of
   [en] with the articular present infinitive passive and the accusative
   of general reference, "in the being fulfilled completely (perfective
   use of [sun-] as to the day of Pentecost." Common verb, but only in
   Luke in N.T. In literal sense of filling a boat in Lu 8:23, about days
   in Lu 9:51 as here. Whether the disciples expected the coming of the
   Holy Spirit on this day we do not know. Blass holds that the present
   tense shows that the day had not yet come. It is a Hebrew idiom (Ex
   7:25) and Luke may mean that the day of Pentecost was not yet over, was
   still going on, though Hackett takes it for the interval (fifty days)
   between Passover and Pentecost. Apparently this day of Pentecost fell
   on the Jewish Sabbath (our Saturday). It was the feast of first fruits.
   All together in one place [pantes homou epi to auto]. All together in
   the same place. Note [homou] here (correct text), not [homothumadon] as
   in 1:14, and so a bit of tautology.

   2:2 Suddenly [aphnO]. Old adverb, but in the N.T. only in Acts (2:2;
   16:26; 28:6). Kin to [exaiphnes] (Ac 22:61). A sound [echos]. Our
   [echo]. Old word, already in Lu 4:37 for rumour and Lu 21:25 for the
   roar of the sea. It was not wind, but a roar or reverberation "as of
   the rushing of a mighty wind" [hOsper pheromenes pnoes biaias]. This is
   not a strict translation nor is it the genitive absolute. It was "an
   echoing sound as of a mighty wind borne violently" (or rushing along
   like the whirr of a tornado). [Pnoe] (wind) is used here (in the N.T.
   only here and 17:25 though old word) probably because of the use of
   [pneuma] in verse 4 of the Holy Spirit. In Joh 3:5-8 [pneuma] occurs
   for both wind and Spirit. Filled [eplerOsen]. "As a bath is filled with
   water, that they might be baptized with the Holy Ghost, in fulfilment
   of Ac 1:5" (Canon Cook). They were sitting [esan kathemenoi].
   Periphrastic imperfect middle of [kathemai].

   2:3 Parting asunder [diamerizomenai]. Present middle (or passive)
   participle of [diamerizO], old verb, to cleave asunder, to cut in
   pieces as a butcher does meat (aorist passive in Lu 11:17f.). So middle
   here would mean, parting themselves asunder or distributing themselves.
   The passive voice would be "being distributed." The middle is probably
   correct and means that "the fire-like appearance presented itself at
   first, as it were, in a single body, and then suddenly parted in this
   direction and that; so that a portion of it rested on each of those
   present" (Hackett). The idea is not that each tongue was cloven, but
   each separate tongue looked like fire, not real fire, but looking like
   [hOsei], as if) fire. The audible sign is followed by a visible one
   (Knowling). "Fire had always been, with the Jews, the symbol of the
   Divine presence (cf. Ex 3:2; De 5:4). No symbol could be more fitting
   to express the Spirit's purifying energy and refining energy"
   (Furneaux). The Baptist had predicted a baptizing by the Messiah in the
   Holy Spirit and in fire (Mt 3:11). It sat [ekathisen]. Singular verb
   here, though plural [Opthesan] with tongues [glOssai]. A tongue that
   looked like fire sat upon each one.

   2:4 With other tongues [heterais glOssais]. Other than their native
   tongues. Each one began to speak in a language that he had not acquired
   and yet it was a real language and understood by those from various
   lands familiar with them. It was not jargon, but intelligible language.
   Jesus had said that the gospel was to go to all the nations and here
   the various tongues of earth were spoken. One might conclude that this
   was the way in which the message was to be carried to the nations, but
   future developments disprove it. This is a third miracle (the sound,
   the tongues like fire, the untaught languages). There is no blinking
   the fact that Luke so pictures them. One need not be surprised if this
   occasion marks the fulfilment of the Promise of the Father. But one is
   not to confound these miraculous signs with the Holy Spirit. They are
   merely proof that he has come to carry on the work of his dispensation.
   The gift of tongues came also on the house of Cornelius at Caesarea (Ac
   10:44-47; 11:15-17), the disciples of John at Ephesus (Ac 19:6), the
   disciples at Corinth (1Co 14:1-33). It is possible that the gift
   appeared also at Samaria (Ac 8:18). But it was not a general or a
   permanent gift. Paul explains in 1Co 14:22 that "tongues" were a sign
   to unbelievers and were not to be exercised unless one was present who
   understood them and could translate them. This restriction disposes at
   once of the modern so-called tongues which are nothing but jargon and
   hysteria. It so happened that here on this occasion at Pentecost there
   were Jews from all parts of the world, so that some one would
   understand one tongue and some another without an interpreter such as
   was needed at Corinth. The experience is identical in all four
   instances and they are not for edification or instruction, but for
   adoration and wonder and worship. As the Spirit gave them utterance
   [kathOs to pneuma edidou apophtheggesthai autois]. This is precisely
   what Paul claims in 1Co 12:10, 28, but all the same without an
   interpreter the gift was not to be exercised (1Co 14:6-19). Paul had
   the gift of tongues, but refused to exercise it except as it would be
   understood. Note the imperfect tense here [edidou]. Perhaps they did
   not all speak at once, but one after another. [Apophtheggesthai] is a
   late verb (LXX of prophesying, papyri). Lucian uses it of the ring of a
   vessel when it strikes a reef. It is used of eager, elevated,
   impassioned utterance. In the N.T. only here, verse 14; verse26:25.
   [Apophthegm] is from this verb.

   2:5 Were dwelling [esan katoikountes]. Periphrastic imperfect active
   indicative. Usually [katoikeO] means residence in a place (4:16; 7:24;
   9:22, 32) as in verse 14 (Luke 13:4). Perhaps some had come to
   Jerusalem to live while others were here only temporarily, for the same
   word occurs in verse 9 of those who dwell in Mesopotamia, etc. Devout
   [eulabeis]. Reverent [eu], well, [lambanO], to take). See on Lu 2:25
   like Simeon waiting for the consolation of Israel or hoping to die and
   be buried in the Holy City and also Ac 8:2.

   2:6 When this sound was heard [genomenes tes phOnes tautes]. Genitive
   absolute with aorist middle participle. Note [phOne] this time, not
   [echo] as in verse 1. [PhOne] originally meant sound as of the wind
   (Joh 3:8) or an instrument (1Co 14:7,8,10), then voice of men. The
   meaning seems to be that the excited "other tongues" of verse 4 were so
   loud that the noise drew the crowd together. The house where the 120
   were may have been (Hackett) on one of the avenues leading to the
   temple. Were confounded [sunechuthe]. First aorist passive indicative
   of [suncheO] or [sunchunO], to pour together precisely like the Latin
   confundo, to confound. The Vulgate has it mente confusa est. It is an
   old verb, but in the N.T. only in Acts five times (2:6; 9:22; 19:32;
   21:27, 31). In his own language [tei idiai dialektOi]. Locative case.
   Each one could understand his own language when he heard that. Every
   one that came heard somebody speaking in his native tongue.

   2:7 Were amazed [existanto]. Imperfect middle of [existemi], to stand
   out of themselves, wide-open astonishment. Marvelled [ethaumazon].
   Imperfect active. The wonder grew and grew. Galileans [Galilaioi].
   There were few followers of Jesus as yet from Jerusalem. The Galileans
   spoke a rude Aramaic (Mr 14:70) and probably crude Greek vernacular
   also. They were not strong on language and yet these are the very
   people who now show such remarkable linguistic powers. These people who
   have come together are all Jews and therefore know Aramaic and the
   vernacular Koine, but there were various local tongues "wherein we were
   born" [en hei egennethemen]. An example is the Lycaonian (Ac 14:11).
   These Galilean Christians are now heard speaking these various local
   tongues. The lists in verses 9-11 are not linguistic, but geographical
   and merely illustrate how widespread the Dispersion [Diaspora] of the
   Jews was as represented on this occasion. Jews were everywhere, these
   "Jews among the nations" (Ac 21:21). Page notes four main divisions
   here: (I) The Eastern or Babylonian, like the Parthians, Medes,
   Elamites, Mesopotamians. (2) The Syrian like Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus,
   Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia. (3) The Egyptian like Egypt, Libya, Cyrene.
   (4) The Roman. Jews and proselytes [proselutoi]. These last from
   [proserchomai], to come to, to join, Gentile converts to Judaism
   (circumcision, baptism, sacrifice). This proselyte baptism was
   immersion as is shown by I. Abrahams (Studies in Pharisaism and the
   Gospels, p. 38). Many remained uncircumcised and were called proselytes
   of the gate.

   2:11 Cretes and Arabians. These two groups "seem to have been added to
   the list as an afterthought" (Knowling). Crete is an island to itself
   and Arabia was separate also though near Judea and full of Jews. The
   point is not that each one of these groups of Jews spoke a different
   language, but that wherever there was a local tongue they heard men
   speaking in it. We do hear them speaking [akouomen lalountOn autOn].
   Genitive case [autOn] with [akouO] the participle [lalountOn] agreeing
   with [autOn], a sort of participial idiom of indirect discourse
   (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1040ff.). The mighty works [ta megaleia]. Old
   adjective for magnificent. In LXX, but only here (not genuine in Lu
   1:49) in the N.T. Cf. 2Pe 1:16 for [megaleiotes] (majesty).

   2:12 Were perplexed [dieporounto]. Imperfect middle of [diaporeO]
   [dia], [a] privative, [poros] to be wholly at a loss. Old verb, but in
   N.T. only in Luke and Acts. They continued amazed [existanto] and
   puzzled. What meaneth this? [Ti thelei touto einai]. Literally, what
   does this wish to be?

   2:13 Mocking [diachleuazontes]. Old verb, but only here in the N.T.,
   though the simple verb (without [dia] in 17:32. [Chleue] means a joke.
   With new wine [gleukous]. Sweet wine, but intoxicating. Sweet wine kept
   a year was very intoxicating. Genitive case here after [memestOmenoi
   eisin] (periphrastic perfect passive indicative), old verb [mestoO],
   only here in the N.T. Tanked up with new wine, state of fulness.

   2:14 Standing up with the eleven [statheis sun tois hendeka]. Took his
   stand with the eleven including Matthias, who also rose up with them,
   and spoke as their spokesman, a formal and impressive beginning. The
   Codex Bezae has "ten apostles." Luke is fond of this pictorial use of
   [statheis] (first aorist passive participle of [histemi] as seen
   nowhere else in the N.T. (Lu 18:11,40; 19:8; Ac 5:20; 17:22; 27:21).
   Lifted up his voice [eperen ten phOnen autou]. This phrase only in Luke
   in the N.T. (Lu 11:29; Ac 2:14; 14:11; 22:22), but is common in the old
   writers. First aorist active indicative of [epairO]. The large crowd
   and the confusion of tongues demanded loud speaking. "This most solemn,
   earnest, yet sober speech" (Bengel). Codex Bezae adds "first" after
   "voice." Peter did it to win and hold attention. Give ear unto my words
   [enOtisasthe ta rhemata mou]. Late verb in LXX and only here in the
   N.T. First aorist middle from [enOtizomai] [en, ous], ear) to give ear
   to, receive into the ear. People's ears differ greatly, but in public
   speech they have to be reached through the ear. That puts an obligation
   on the speaker and also on the auditors who should sit where they can
   hear with the ears which they have, an obligation often overlooked.

   2:15 As ye suppose [hOs humeis hupolambanete]. Note use of [humeis]
   (ye) for decided emphasis. The third hour [hOra trite]. Three o'clock
   in the day Jewish time, nine Roman. Drunkenness belongs to the night
   (1Th 5:7). It was a quick, common sense reply, and complete answer to
   their suspicion.

   2:16 This is that which hath been spoken by the prophet Joel [touto
   estin to eiremenon dia tou prophetou IOel]. Positive interpretation of
   the supernatural phenomena in the light of the Messianic prophecy of
   Joe 2:28-32. Peter's mind is now opened by the Holy Spirit to
   understand the Messianic prophecy and the fulfilment right before their
   eyes. Peter now has spiritual insight and moral courage. The power
   [dunamis] of the Holy Spirit has come upon him as he proceeds to give
   the first interpretation of the life and work of Jesus Christ since his
   Ascension. It is also the first formal apology for Christianity to a
   public audience. Peter rises to the height of his powers in this
   remarkable sermon. Jesus had foretold that he would be a Rock and now
   he is no longer shale, but a solid force for aggressive Christianity.
   He follows here in verses 17-21 closely the LXX text of Joel and then
   applies the passage to the present emergency (22-24).

   2:17 In the last days [en tais eschatais hemerais]. Joel does not have
   precisely these words, but he defines "those days" as being "the day of
   the Lord" (cf. Isa 2:2; Mic 4:1). I will pour forth [ekcheO]. Future
   active indicative of [ekcheO]. This future like [edomai] and [piomai]
   is without tense sign, probably like the present in the futuristic
   sense (Robertson, Grammar, p. 354). Westcott and Hort put a different
   accent on the future, but the old Greek had no accent. The old Greek
   had [ekcheusO]. This verb means to pour out. Of my Spirit [apo tou
   pneumatos]. This use of [apo] (of) is either because of the variety in
   the manifestations of the Spirit (1Co 12) or because the Spirit in his
   entirety remains with God (Holtzmann, Wendt). But the Hebrew has it: "I
   will pour out my Spirit" without the partitive idea in the LXX. And
   your daughters [kai hai thugateres h-mOn]. Anna is called a prophetess
   in Lu 2:36 and the daughters of Philip prophesy (Ac 21:9) and verse 18
   (handmaidens). See also 1Co 11:5 [prophetousa]. Visions [horaseis].
   Late word for the more common [horama], both from [horaO], to see. In
   Re 4:3 it means appearance, but in Re 9:17 as here an ecstatic
   revelation or vision. Dream dreams [enupniois enupniasthesontai]. Shall
   dream with (instrumental case) dreams. First future passive of
   [enupniazO] from [enupnios] [en] and [hupnos], in sleep), a common late
   word. Only here in the N.T. (this from Joel as all these verses 17-21
   are) and Jude 1:8. Yea and [kai ge]. Intensive particle [ge] added to
   [kai] (and), an emphatic addition (=Hebrew vegam). Servants [doulous],
   handmaidens [doulas]. Slaves, actual slaves of men. The humblest
   classes will receive the Spirit of God (cf. 1Co 1:26-31). But the word
   "prophesy" here is not in the LXX (or the Hebrew).

   2:19 Wonders [terata]. Apparently akin to the verb [tereO], to watch
   like a wonder in the sky, miracle [miraculum], marvel, portent. In the
   New Testament the word occurs only in the plural and only in connection
   with [semeia] (signs) as here and in verse 43. But signs [semeia] here
   is not in the LXX. See on Mt 11:20. In verse 22 all three words occur
   together: powers, wonders, signs [dunamesi, terasi, semeiois]. As above
   [anO]. This word is not in the LXX nor is "beneath" [katO], both
   probably being added to make clearer the contrast between heaven and
   earth. Blood and fire and vapour of smoke [haima kai pur kai atmida
   kapnou]. A chiasm as these words illustrate bloodshed and destruction
   by fire as signs here on earth.

   2:20 Shall be turned [metastraphesetai]. Second future passive of
   [metastrephO], common verb, but only three times in the N.T. (Ac 2:20
   from Joel; Jas 4:9; Ga 1:7). These are the "wonders" or portents of
   verse 19. It is worth noting that Peter interprets these "portents" as
   fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost, though no such change of the sun
   into darkness or of the moon into blood is recorded. Clearly Peter does
   not interpret the symbolism of Joel in literal terms. This method of
   Peter may be of some service in the Book of Revelation where so many
   apocalyptic symbols occur as well as in the great Eschatological
   Discourse of Jesus in Mt 24, 25. In Mt 24:6, 29 Jesus had spoken of
   wars on earth and wonders in heaven. Before the day of the Lord come,
   that great and notable day [prin elthein hemeran kuriou ten megalen kai
   epiphane]. The use of [prin] with the infinitive and the accusative of
   general reference is a regular Greek idiom. The use of the adjectives
   with the article is also good Greek, though the article is not here
   repeated as in 1:25. The Day of the Lord is a definite conception
   without the article. Notable [epiphane] is the same root as epiphany
   [epiphaneia] used of the Second Coming of Christ (2Th 2:8; 1Ti 6:14;
   2Ti 4:1; Tit 2:13). It translates here the Hebrew word for "terrible."
   In the Epistles the Day of the Lord is applied (Knowling) to the Coming
   of Christ for judgment (1Th 5:2; 1Co 1:8; 2Co 1:14; Php 1:10).

   2:21 Shall call on [epikalesetai]. First aorist middle subjunctive of
   [epikaleO], common verb, to call to, middle voice for oneself in need.
   Indefinite relative clause with [ean] and so subjunctive, punctiliar
   idea, in any single case, and so aorist.

   2:22 Hear these words [akousate tous logous toutous]. Do it now (aorist
   tense). With unerring aim Peter has found the solution for the
   phenomena. He has found the key to God's work on this day in his words
   through Joel. as ye yourselves know [kathOs autoi oidate]. Note [autoi]
   for emphasis. Peter calls the audience to witness that his statements
   are true concerning "Jesus the Nazarene." He wrought his miracles by
   the power of God in the midst of these very people here present.

   2:23 Him [touton]. "This one," resumptive and emphatic object of "did
   crucify and slay." Being delivered up [ekdoton]. Verbal adjective from
   [ekdidOmi], to give out or over. Old word, but here only in the N.T.
   Delivered up by Judas, Peter means. By the determinate counsel and
   foreknowledge of God [tei hOrismenei boulei kai prognOsei tou theou].
   Instrumental case. Note both purpose [boule] and foreknowledge
   [prognOsis] of God and "determined" [hOrismene], perfect passive
   participle, state of completion). God had willed the death of Jesus
   (Joh 3:16) and the death of Judas (Ac 1:16), but that fact did not
   absolve Judas from his responsibility and guilt (Lu 22:22). He acted as
   a free moral agent. By the hand [dia cheiros]. Luke is fond of these
   figures (hand, face, etc.) very much like the Hebrew though the
   vernacular of all languages uses them. Lawless men [anomOn]. Men
   without law, who recognize no law for their conduct, like men in high
   and low stations today who defy the laws of God and man. Old word, very
   common in the LXX. Ye did crucify [prospexantes]. First aorist active
   participle of [prospegnumi], rare compound word in Dio Cassius and here
   only in the N.T. One must supply [tOi staurOi] and so it means
   "fastened to the cross," a graphic picture like Paul's "nailed to the
   cross" [proselOsas tOi staurOi] in Col 2:14. Did slay [aneilate].
   Second aorist active indicative with first aorist vowel [a] instead of
   [o] as is common in the Koine. This verb [anaireO], to take up, is
   often used for kill as in Ac 12:2. Note Peter's boldness now under the
   power of the Holy Spirit. He charges the people to their faces with the
   death of Christ.

   2:24 God raised up [ho theos anestesen]. Est hoc summum orationis
   (Blass). Apparently this is the first public proclamation to others
   than believers of the fact of the Resurrection of Jesus. "At a time it
   was still possible to test the statement, to examine witnesses, to
   expose fraud, the Apostle openly proclaimed the Resurrection as a fact,
   needing no evidence, but known to his hearers" (Furneaux). The pangs of
   death [tas Odinas tou thanatou]. Codex Bezae has "Hades" instead of
   death. The LXX has [Odinas thanatou] in Ps 18:4, but the Hebrew
   original means "snares" or "traps" or "cords" of death where sheol and
   death are personified as hunters laying snares for prey. How Peter or
   Luke came to use the old Greek word [Odinas] (birth pangs) we do not
   know. Early Christian writers interpreted the Resurrection of Christ as
   a birth out of death. "Loosing" [lusas] suits better the notion of
   "snares" held a prisoner by death, but birth pangs do bring deliverance
   to the mother also. Because [kathoti]. This old conjunction [kata,
   hoti] occurs in the N.T. only in Luke's writings. That he should be
   holden [krateisthai auton]. Infinitive present passive with accusative
   of general reference and subject of [en adunaton]. The figure goes with
   "loosed" [lusas] above.

   2:25 Concerning him [eis auton]. Peter interprets Ps 16:8-11 as written
   by David and with reference to the Messiah. There is but one speaker in
   this Psalm and both Peter here and Paul in Ac 13:36 make it the
   Messiah. David is giving his own experience which is typical of the
   Messiah (Knowling). I beheld [proorOmen]. Imperfect middle without
   augment of [prooraO], common verb, but only twice in the N.T., to see
   beforehand (Ac 21:29) or to see right before one as here. This idea of
   [pro-] is made plainer by "before my face" [enOpion mou]. On my right
   hand [ek dexiOn mou]. The Lord Jehovah like a defender or advocate
   stands at David's right hand as in trials in court (Ps 109:31). That
   [hina] here is almost result. Moved [saleuthO]. First aorist passive
   subjunctive of [saleuO], to shake like an earthquake.

   2:26 Was glad [euphranthe]. First aorist (timeless here like the Hebrew
   perfect) passive indicative of [euphrainO] (cf. Lu 15:32). Timeless
   also is "rejoiced" [egalliasato]. Shall dwell [kataskenOsei]. Shall
   tabernacle, pitch a tent, make one's abode (cf. Mt 13:32). See on Mt
   8:20 about [kataskenOseis] (nests) In hope [ep' elpidi]. On hope, the
   hope of the resurrection.

   2:27 In Hades [eis Haiden]. Hades is the unseen world, Hebrew Sheol,
   but here it is viewed as death itself "considered as a rapacious
   destroyer" (Hackett). It does not mean the place of punishment, though
   both heaven and the place of torment are in Hades (Lu 16:23). "Death
   and Hades are strictly parallel terms: he who is dead is in Hades"
   (Page). The use of [eis] here = [en] is common enough. The Textus
   Receptus here reads [eis Haidou] (genitive case) like the Attic idiom
   with [domon] (abode) understood. "Hades" in English is not translation,
   but transliteration. The phrase in the Apostles' Creed, "descended into
   hell" is from this passage in Acts (Hades, not Gehenna). The English
   word "hell" is Anglo-Saxon from [helan], to hide, and was used in the
   Authorized Version to translate both Hades as here and Gehenna as in Mt
   5:22. Thy Holy One [ton hosion sou]. Peter applies these words to the
   Messiah. Corruption [diaphthoran]. The word can mean destruction or
   putrefaction from [diaphtheirO], old word, but in N.T. only here and Ac
   13:34-37. The Hebrew word in Ps 16 can mean also the pit or the deep.

   2:28 The ways of life [hodous zOes]. Though dead God will show him the
   ways back to life.

   2:29 I may say [exon eipein]. Supply [estin] before [exon],
   periphrastic present indicative of [exeimi], to allow, permit. The
   Authorized Version has "Let me speak," supplying [esto] present
   imperative. Freely [meta parresias]. Telling it all [pan, rhesia] from
   [eipon], to speak), with fulness, with boldness. Luke is fond of the
   phrase (as in 4:13). It is a new start for Simon Peter, full of
   boldness and courage. The patriarch [tou patriarchou]. Transliteration
   of the word, from [patria], family, and [archO], to rule, the founder
   of a family. Late word in LXX. Used of Abraham (Heb 7:4), of the twelve
   sons of Jacob as founders of the several tribes (Ac 7:8), and here of
   David as head of the family from whom the Messiah comes. Was buried
   [etaphe]. Second aorist passive indicative of [thaptO]. His tomb was on
   Mt. Zion where most of the kings were buried. The tomb was said to have
   fallen into ruins in the time of the Emperor Hadrian. Josephus (Ant.
   XVI. 7, 1) attributes most of the misfortunes of Herod's family to the
   fact that he tried to rifle the tomb of David.

   2:31 Foreseeing [proidOn]. Second aorist active participle. Did it as a
   prophet. Of the Christ [tou Christou]. Of the Messiah. See under verse
   32. This is a definite statement by Peter that David knew that in Ps 16
   he was describing the resurrection of the Messiah.

   2:32 This Jesus [touton ton Iesoun]. Many of the name "Jesus," but he
   means the one already called "the Nazarene" (verse 22) and foretold as
   the Messiah in Ps 16 and raised from the dead by God in proof that he
   is the Messiah (2:24, 32), "this Jesus whom ye crucified" (verse 36).
   Other terms used of him in the Acts are the Messiah, verse 31, the one
   whom God "anointed" (Ac 10:38), as in Joh 1:41, Jesus Christ (9:34). In
   2:36 God made this Jesus Messiah, in 3:20 the Messiah Jesus, in 17:3
   Jesus is the Messiah, in 18:5 the Messiah is Jesus, in 24:24 Christ
   Jesus. Whereof [hou]. Or "of whom." Either makes sense and both are
   true. Peter claims the whole 120 as personal witnesses to the fact of
   the Resurrection of Jesus from the dead and they are all present as
   Peter calls them to witness on the point. In Galilee over 500 had seen
   the Risen Christ at one time (1Co 15:6) most of whom were still living
   when Paul wrote. Thus the direct evidence for the resurrection of Jesus
   piles up in cumulative force.

   2:33 By the right hand of God [tei dexiai tou theou]. This translation
   makes it the instrumental case. The margin has it "at" instead of "by,"
   that is the locative case. And it will make sense in the true dative
   case, "to the right hand of God." These three cases came to have the
   same form in Greek. Ro 8:24 furnishes another illustration of like
   ambiguity [tei elpidi], saved by hope, in hope, or for hope. Usually it
   is quite easy to tell the case when the form is identical. Exalted
   [hupsOtheis]. First aorist passive participle of [hupsoO], to lift up.
   Here both the literal and tropical sense occurs. Cf. Joh 12:32. The
   promise of the Holy Spirit [ten epaggelian tou pneumatos tou hagiou].
   The promise mentioned in 1:4 and now come true, consisting in the Holy
   Spirit "from the Father" [para tou patros], sent by the Father and by
   the Son (Joh 15:26; 16:7). See also Ga 3:14. He hath poured forth
   [execheen]. Aorist active indicative of [ekcheO] the verb used by Joel
   and quoted by Peter already in verses 17, 18. Jesus has fulfilled his
   promise. This which ye see and hear [touto ho humeis kai blepete kai
   akouete]. This includes the sound like the rushing wind, the tongues
   like fire on each of them, the different languages spoken by the 120.
   "The proof was before their eyes in this new energy from heaven"
   (Furneaux), a culminating demonstration that Jesus was the Messiah.

   2:34 Ascended not [ou--anebe]. It is more emphatic than that: For not
   David ascended into the heavens. Peter quotes Ps 110:1 as proof. No
   passage in the O.T. is so constantly quoted as Messianic as this. "St.
   Peter does not demand belief upon his own assertion, but he again
   appeals to the Scriptures, and to words which could not have received a
   fulfilment in the case of David" (Knowling). Sit thou [kathou]. Late
   Koine form for earlier [katheso], present middle imperative second
   singular of [kathemai].

   2:35 Till I make [heOs an thO]. Second aorist active subjunctive of
   [tithemi] with [an] after [heOs] for the future, a common Greek idiom.
   This dominion of Christ as Mediator will last till the plan of the
   kingdom is carried out (1Co 15:23-28). Complete subjugation will come,
   perhaps referring to the custom of victorious kings placing their feet
   upon the necks of their enemies (Jos 10:24). Therefore assuredly
   [AsphalOs oun]. Assuredly therefore, without any slip or trip
   [asphales] from [a] privative and [sphallO], to trip, to slip. Peter
   draws a powerfully pungent conclusion by the use of the adverb
   [asphalOs] and the inferential conjunction [oun].) Peter's closing
   sentence drives home the point of his sermon: "This very Jesus whom ye
   crucified (note [humeis], strongly emphatic ye), him God made both Lord
   and Messiah" [kai kurion kai Christon], as David foretold in Ps 110 and
   as the events of this day have confirmed. The critics are disturbed
   over how Luke could have gotten the substance of this masterful address
   spoken on the spur of the moment with passion and power. They even say
   that Luke composed it for Peter and put the words in his mouth. If so,
   he made a good job of it. But Peter could have written out the notes of
   the address afterwards. Luke had plenty of chances to get hold of it
   from Peter or from others.

   2:37 They were pricked in their heart [katenugesan ten kardian]. Second
   aorist indicative of [katanussO], a rare verb (LXX) to pierce, to sting
   sharply, to stun, to smite. Homer used it of horses dinting the earth
   with their hoofs. The substantive [katanuxis] occurs in Ro 11:8. Here
   only in the N.T. It is followed here by the accusative of the part
   affected, the heart. What shall we do? [Ti poiesOmen]. Deliberative
   subjunctive first aorist active. The sermon went home, they felt the
   sting of Peter's words, compunction [compungo]. Codex Bezae adds: "Show
   us."

   2:38 Repent ye [metanoesate]. First aorist (ingressive) active
   imperative. Change your mind and your life. Turn right about and do it
   now. You crucified this Jesus. Now crown him in your hearts as Lord and
   Christ. This first. And be baptized every one of you [kai baptisthetO
   hekastos h-mOn]. Rather, "And let each one of you be baptized." Change
   of number from plural to singular and of person from second to third.
   This change marks a break in the thought here that the English
   translation does not preserve. The first thing to do is make a radical
   and complete change of heart and life. Then let each one be baptized
   after this change has taken place, and the act of baptism be performed
   "in the name of Jesus Christ" [en tOi onomati Iesou Christou]. In
   accordance with the command of Jesus in Mt 28:19 [eis to onoma]. No
   distinction is to be insisted on between [eis to onoma] and [en tOi
   onomati] with [baptizO] since [eis] and [en] are really the same word
   in origin. In Ac 10:48 [en tOi onomati Iesou Christou] occurs, but
   [eis] to [onoma] in 8:16; 19:5. The use of [onoma] means in the name or
   with the authority of one as [eis onoma prophetou] (Mt 10:41) as a
   prophet, in the name of a prophet. In the Acts the full name of the
   Trinity does not occur in baptism as in Mt 28:19, but this does not
   show that it was not used. The name of Jesus Christ is the distinctive
   one in Christian baptism and really involves the Father and the Spirit.
   See on Mt 28:19 for discussion of this point. "Luke does not give the
   form of words used in baptism by the Apostles, but merely states the
   fact that they baptized those who acknowledged Jesus as Messiah or as
   Lord" (Page). Unto the remission of your sins [eis aphesin tOn
   hamartiOn h-mOn]. This phrase is the subject of endless controversy as
   men look at it from the standpoint of sacramental or of evangelical
   theology. In themselves the words can express aim or purpose for that
   use of [eis] does exist as in 1Co 2:7 [eis doxan hemOn] (for our
   glory). But then another usage exists which is just as good Greek as
   the use of [eis] for aim or purpose. It is seen in Mt 10:41 in three
   examples [eis onoma prophetou, dikaiou, mathetou] where it cannot be
   purpose or aim, but rather the basis or ground, on the basis of the
   name of prophet, righteous man, disciple, because one is, etc. It is
   seen again in Mt 12:41 about the preaching of Jonah [eis to kerugma
   IOna]. They repented because of (or at) the preaching of Jonah. The
   illustrations of both usages are numerous in the N.T. and the Koine
   generally (Robertson, Grammar, p. 592). One will decide the use here
   according as he believes that baptism is essential to the remission of
   sins or not. My view is decidedly against the idea that Peter, Paul, or
   any one in the New Testament taught baptism as essential to the
   remission of sins or the means of securing such remission. So I
   understand Peter to be urging baptism on each of them who had already
   turned (repented) and for it to be done in the name of Jesus Christ on
   the basis of the forgiveness of sins which they had already received.
   The gift of the Holy Ghost [ten dOrean tou hagiou pneumatos]. The gift
   consists (Ac 8:17) in the Holy Spirit (genitive of identification).

   2:39 The promise [he epaggelia]. The promise made by Jesus (1:4) and
   foretold by Joel (verse 18). To you [humin]. You Jews. To your
   descendants, sons and daughters of verse 17. To all that are afar off
   [pasin tois eis makran].) The horizon widens and includes the Gentiles.
   Those "afar off" from the Jews were the heathen (Isa 49:1; 57:19; Eph
   2:13, 17). The rabbis so used it. Shall call [an proskalesetai]. First
   aorist middle subjunctive with [an] in an indefinite relative clause, a
   perfectly regular construction. The Lord God calls men of every nation
   anywhere whether Jews or Gentiles. It may be doubted how clearly Peter
   grasped the significance of these words for he will have trouble over
   this very matter on the housetop in Joppa and in Caesarea, but he will
   see before long the full sweep of the great truth that he here
   proclaims under the impulse of the Holy Spirit. It was a great moment
   that Peter here reaches.

   2:40 With many other words [heterois logois pleiosin]. Instrumental
   case. Not necessarily "different" [heterois], but "further," showing
   that Luke does not pretend to give all that Peter said. This idea is
   also brought out clearly by [pleiosin] ("more," not "many"), more than
   these given by Luke. He testified [diemarturato]. First aorist middle
   of [diamarturomai], old verb, to make solemn attestation or call to
   witness (perfective use of [dia], while [martureO] is to bear witness.
   Page insists that here it should be translated "protested solemnly" to
   the Jews as it seems to mean in Lu 16:28; Ac 20:23; 1Ti 5:21; 2Ti 2:14;
   4:1. And exhorted [kai parekalei]. Imperfect active, kept on exhorting.
   Save yourselves [sOthete]. First aorist passive of [sOzO]. Literally,
   Be ye saved. Crooked [skolias]. Old word, opposite of [orthos],
   straight. Pravus the opposite of rectus, a perversity for turning off
   from the truth. Cf. Lu 9:41; Php 2:15.

   2:41 They then [Hoi men oun]. A common phrase in Acts either without
   antithesis as in 1:6; 5:41; 8:4, 25; 9:31; 11:19; 16:5; or with it as
   here, 8:25; 13:4; 14:3; 17:17; 23:31; 25:4. [Oun] connects with what
   precedes as the result of Peter's sermon while [men] points forward to
   what is to follow. Were baptized [ebaptisthesan]. First aorist passive
   indicative, constative aorist. Note that only those who had already
   received the word and were converted were baptized. There were added
   [prosetethesan]. First aorist passive indicative of [prostithemi], old
   verb to add, to join to. Luke means that the 3,000 were added to the
   120 already enlisted. It is not stated they were all baptized by Peter
   or the twelve or all on the same day, though that is the natural
   implication of the language. The numerous pools in Jerusalem afforded
   ample opportunity for such wholesale baptizing and Hackett notes that
   the habit of orientals would place no obstacle in the way of the use of
   the public reservoirs. Furneaux warns us that all the 3,000 may not
   have been genuine converts and that many of them were pilgrims at the
   passover who returned home. Souls [psuchai]. Persons as in verse 43.

   2:42 They continued steadfastly [esan proskarturountes]. Periphrastic
   active imperfect of [proskartureO] as in Ac 1:14 (same participle in
   verse 46). Fellowship [koinOniai]. Old word from [koinOnos] (partner,
   sharer in common interest) and this from [koinos] what is common to
   all. This partnership involves participation in, as the blood of Christ
   (Php 2:1) or co-operation in the work of the gospel (Php 1:5) or
   contribution for those in need (2Co 8:4; 9:13). Hence there is wide
   diversity of opinion concerning the precise meaning of [koinOnia] in
   this verse. It may refer to the distribution of funds in verse 44 or to
   the oneness of spirit in the community of believers or to the Lord's
   Supper (as in 1Co 10:16) in the sense of communion or to the fellowship
   in the common meals or [agapae] (love-feasts). The breaking of bread
   [tei klasei tou artou]. The word [klasis] is an old word, but used only
   by Luke in the N.T. (Lu 24:35; Ac 2:42), though the verb [klaO] occurs
   in other parts of the N.T. as in verse 46. The problem here is whether
   Luke refers to the ordinary meal as in Lu 24:35 or to the Lord's
   Supper. The same verb [klaO] is used of breaking bread at the ordinary
   meal (Lu 24:30) or the Lord's Supper (Lu 22:19). It is generally
   supposed that the early disciples attached so much significance to the
   breaking of bread at the ordinary meals, more than our saying grace,
   that they followed the meal with the Lord's Supper at first, a
   combination called [agapai] or love-feasts. "There can be no doubt that
   the Eucharist at this period was preceded uniformly by a common repast,
   as was the case when the ordinance was instituted" (Hackett). This led
   to some abuses as in 1Co 11:20. Hence it is possible that what is
   referred to here is the Lord's Supper following the ordinary meal. "To
   simply explain [tei klasei tou artou] as = The Holy Communion' is to
   pervert the plain meaning of words, and to mar the picture of family
   life, which the text places before us as the ideal of the early
   believers" (Page). But in Ac 20:7 they seem to have come together
   especially for the observance of the Lord's Supper. Perhaps there is no
   way to settle the point conclusively here. The prayers [tais
   proseuchais]. Services where they prayed as in 1:14, in the temple (Ac
   3:1), in their homes (4:23).

   2:43 Came [egineto]. Imperfect middle, kept on coming. Were done
   [egineto]. Same tense. Awe kept on coming on all and signs and wonders
   kept on coming through the apostles. The two things went on [pari
   passu], the more wonders the more fear.

   2:44 Were together [esan epi to auto]. Some MSS. [esan kai] (were and).
   But they were together in the same place as in 2:1. And had [kai
   eichon]. Imperfect active, kept on having, a habit in the present
   emergency. Common [koina]. It was not actual communism, but they held
   all their property ready for use for the common good as it was needed
   (4:32). This situation appears nowhere else except in Jerusalem and was
   evidently due to special conditions there which did not survive
   permanently. Later Paul will take a special collection for the poor
   saints in Jerusalem.

   2:45 Sold [epipraskon]. Imperfect active, a habit or custom from time
   to time. Old and common verb, [pipraskO]. Parted [diemerizon].
   Imperfect again of [diamerizO], old verb for dividing or distributing
   between [dia] people. According as any man had need [kathoti an tis
   chreian eichen]. Regular Greek idiom for comparative clause with [an]
   and imperfect indicative corresponding precisely with the three
   preceding imperfects (Robertson, Grammar, p. 967).

   2:46 With one accord in the temple [homothumadon en tOi hierOi]. See on
   1:14 for [homothumadon]. They were still worshipping in the temple for
   no breach had yet come between Christians and Jews. Daily they were
   here and daily breaking bread at home [kat' oikon] which looks like the
   regular meal. They did take their food [metelambanon trophes].
   Imperfect tense again and clearly referring to the regular meals at
   home. Does it refer also to the possible [agapai] or to the Lord's
   Supper afterwards as they had common meals "from house to house" [kat'
   oikon]? We know there were local churches in the homes where they had
   "worship rooms," the church in the house. At any rate it was "with
   singleness" [apheloteti] of heart. The word occurs only here in the
   N.T., though a late Koine word (papyri). It comes from [apheles], free
   from rock [phelleus] is stony ground), smooth. The old form was
   [apheleia].

   2:47 Having favor [echontes charin]. Cf. Lu 2:52 of the Boy Jesus.
   Added [prosetithei]. Imperfect active, kept on adding. If the Lord only
   always "added" those who join our churches. Note verse 41 where same
   verb is used of the 3,000. To them [epi to auto]. Literally,
   "together." Why not leave it so? "To the church" [tei ekklesiai] is not
   genuine. Codex Bezae has "in the church." Those that were being saved
   [tous sOzomenous]. Present passive participle. Probably for repetition
   like the imperfect [prosetithei]. Better translate it "those saved from
   time to time." It was a continuous revival, day by day. [SOzO] like
   [sOteria] is used for "save" in three senses (beginning, process,
   conclusion), but here repetition is clearly the point of the present
   tense.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3

   3:1 Were going up [anebainon]. Descriptive imperfect active. They were
   ascending the terraces to the temple courts. The ninth [ten enaten].
   Our three o'clock in the afternoon, the time of the evening sacrifice.
   Peter and John like Paul later kept up the Jewish worship, but not as a
   means of sacramental redemption. There were three hours of prayer
   (third, sixth, ninth).

   3:2 Was carried [ebastazeto]. Imperfect passive, picturing the process
   as in verse 1. Laid daily [etithoun kath' hemeran]. Imperfect again
   describing their custom with this man. Beautiful [HOraian]. This gate
   is not so called elsewhere. It may have been the Gate of Nicanor on the
   east side looking towards Kidron described by Josephus (Ant. XV. 11, 3;
   War V. 5, 3) as composed chiefly of Corinthian brass and very
   magnificent.

   3:3 Asked [erOta]. Began to ask, inchoative imperfect. It was his
   chance.

   3:4 Fastening his eyes [atenisas]. First aorist (ingressive) active
   participle of [atenizO]. For this verb see on Lu 4:20; Ac 1:10. Peter
   fixed his eyes on the beggar and invited him to look [blepson] on them.

   3:5 Gave heed unto them [epeichen autois]. Imperfect active of
   [epechO], to hold to. For the idiom with [ton noun] understood see
   7:14; 1Ti 4:16. He held his eyes right on Peter and John with great
   eagerness "expecting to receive something" [prosdokOn ti labein]. He
   took Peter's invitation as a promise of a large gift.

   3:6 In the name [en tOi onomati]. The healing power is in that name
   (Page) and Peter says so. Cf. Lu 9:49; 10:17; Ac 4:7,10; 19:27; 16:18.
   Walk [peripatei]. Present imperative, inchoative idea, begin to walk
   and then go on walking. But the beggar does not budge. He knows that he
   cannot walk.

   3:7 Took him by the right hand [piasas auton tes dexias cheiros]. Doric
   form [piazO] for [piezO]. Genitive of the part affected. Peter had to
   pull him up on his feet before he would try to walk.

   3:8 Leaping up [exallomenos]. Present middle participle, leaping out
   repeatedly after Peter pulled him up. Only here in the N.T. He stood
   [este]. Second aorist active. Walked [periepatei]. Went on walking,
   imperfect active. He came into the temple repeating these new exercises
   (walking, leaping, praising God).

   3:10 They took knowledge of him [epeginOskon]. Imperfect active,
   inchoative, began to perceive. Were filled [eplesthesan]. Effective
   first aorist passive. At that which had happened [tOi sumbebekoti].
   Perfect active participle of [sumbainO].

   3:11 The Codex Bezae adds "as Peter and John went out." As he held
   [kratountos autou]. Genitive absolute of [krateO], to hold fast, with
   accusative rather than genitive to get hold of (Ac 27:13). Old and
   common verb from [kratos] (strength, force). Perhaps out of gratitude
   and partly from fear (Lu 8:38). In the porch that is called Solomon's
   [epi tei stoai tei kaloumenei SolomOntos]. The adjective Stoic
   [stoikos] is from this word [stoa] (porch). It was on the east side of
   the court of the Gentiles (Josephus, Ant. XX. 9, 7) and was so called
   because it was built on a remnant of the foundations of the ancient
   temple. Jesus had once taught here (Joh 10:23). Greatly wondering
   [ekthamboi]. Wondering out of [ek] measure, already filled with wonder
   [thambous], verse 10). Late adjective. Construction according to sense
   (plural, though [laos] singular) as in 5:16; 6:7; 11:1, etc.

   3:12 Answered [apekrinato]. First aorist middle indicative. The people
   looked their amazement and Peter answered that. Ye men of Israel
   [Andres Israeleitai]. Covenant name and so conciliatory, the stock of
   Israel (Php 3:5). At this man [epi toutOi]. Probably so, though it
   could be "at this thing." Fasten you your eyes [atenizete]. The very
   verb used about Peter in verse 4. On us [hemin]. Dative case, emphatic
   proleptical position before [ti atenizete]. On us why do ye fasten your
   eyes? As though [hOs]. [HOs] with the participle gives the alleged
   reason, not always the true one. Power [dunamei]. Instrumental case,
   causa effectiva. Godliness [eusebeiai]. Causa meritoria. Had made
   [pepoiekosin]. Perfect active participle of [poieO]. To walk [tou
   peripatein]. Articular infinitive in the genitive case of result,
   purpose easily shading off into result (ecbatic infinitive) as here as
   is true also of [hina].

   3:13 His servant Jesus [ton paida Iesoun]. This phrase occurs in Isa
   42:1; 52:13 about the Messiah except the name "Jesus" which Peter adds,
   the first part of the quotation is from Ex 3:6; 5:30. The LXX
   translated the Hebrew ebhedh by [pais], the servant of Jehovah being a
   Messianic designation. But the phrase "servant of God" [pais theou] is
   applied also to Israel (Lu 1:54) and to David (Lu 1:69; Ac 4:25). Paul
   terms himself [doulos theou] (Tit 1:1). [Pais] is just child (boy or
   girl), and it was also used of a slave (Mt 8:6, 8, 13). But it is not
   here [huios] (son) that Peter uses, but [pais]. Luke quotes Peter as
   using it again in this Messianic sense in Ac 3:26; 4:27, 30. Whom ye
   delivered up [hon humeis men paredOkate]. Note emphatic use of [humeis]
   (ye). No [de] to correspond to [men]. First aorist active [k] aorist)
   plural indicative of [paradidOmi] (usual form [paredote], second
   aorist). When he [ekeinou]. Emphatic pronoun, that one, in contrast
   with "ye" [humeis], genitive absolute with [krinantos], here the
   nearest word (Pilate), the latter.

   3:14 But ye [humeis de]. In contrast with Pilate [ekeinou]. Murderer
   [andra phonea]. A man a murderer. In contrast with "the Holy and
   Righteous One." To be granted [charisthenai]. As a favour [charis].
   First aorist passive infinitive of [charizomai]; So also 25:11; 27:24.

   3:15 But the Prince of life ye killed [ton de archegon tes zOes
   apekteinate]. "The magnificent antithesis" (Bengel) Peter here draws
   between their asking for a murderer and killing the Prince (or Author)
   of life. Peter pictures Jesus as the source of all life as is done in
   Joh 1:1-18; Col 1:14-20; Heb 1:2f. [Archegos] [arche], beginning,
   [agO], to lead) is an adjective "furnishing the first cause or
   occasion" in Euripides, Plato. Thence substantive, the originator, the
   leader, the pioneer as of Jesus both Beginner and Finisher (Heb 12:2).
   See also Heb 2:10; Ac 5:31 where it is applied to Jesus as "Prince and
   Saviour." But God raised him from the dead in contrast to what they had
   done. Whereof we are witnesses [hou hemeis martures esmen]. Of which
   fact (the resurrection) or of whom as risen, [hou] having the same form
   in the genitive singular for masculine or neuter. Peter had boldly
   claimed that all the 120 have seen the Risen Christ. There is no denial
   of that claim.

   3:16 By faith in his name [tei pistei tou onomatos autou]. Instrumental
   case of [pistei] (Aleph and B do not have [epi] and objective genitive
   of [onomatos]. His name [to onoma autou]. Repeats the word name to make
   the point clear. Cf. verse 6 where Peter uses "the name of Jesus Christ
   of Nazareth" when he healed the man. Made strong [estereOsen]. Same
   verb used in verse 7 (and 16:5). Nowhere else in the N.T. Old verb from
   [stereos], firm, solid. Through him [di' autou]. Through Jesus, the
   object of faith and the source of it. Perfect soundness [holoklerian].
   Perfect in all its parts, complete, whole (from [holos], whole,
   [kleros], allotment). Late word (Plutarch) once in LXX (Isa 1:6) and
   here alone in the N.T., but adjective [holokleros], old and common (Jas
   1:4; 1Th 5:23).

   3:17 And now [kai nun]. Luke is fond of these particles of transition
   (7:34; 10:5; 20:25; 22:16) and also [kai ta nun] (4:29; 5:38; 22:32;
   27:22), and even [kai nun idou] (13:11; 20:22). I wot [oida]. Old
   English for "I know." In ignorance [kata agnoian]. This use of [kata]
   occurs in the Koine. See also Phm 1:14. One may see Lu 23:34 for the
   words of the Saviour on the Cross. "They had sinned, but their sin was
   not of so deep a dye that it could not have been still more heinous"
   (Hackett). If they had known what they were doing, they would not
   knowingly have crucified the Messiah (1Co 2:8).

   3:18 Foreshewed [prokateggeilen]. First aorist active indicative of
   [prokataggellO], late compound to announce fully beforehand. Only twice
   in the N.T. in the critical text (Ac 3:18; 7:52). That his Christ
   should suffer [pathein ton Christon autou]. Accusative of general
   reference with the aorist active infinitive [pathein] of [paschO] in
   indirect discourse (predictive purpose of God). Their crime, though
   real, was carrying out God's purpose (2:23; Joh 3:16). See the same
   idea in Ac 17:3; 26:23. This "immense paradox" (Page) was a stumbling
   block to these Jews as it is yet (1Co 1:23). Peter discusses the
   sufferings of Christ in 1Pe 4:13; 5:1.

   3:19 Repent therefore [metanoesate oun]. Peter repeats to this new
   crowd the command made in Ac 2:38 which see. God's purpose and patience
   call for instant change of attitude on their part. Their guilt does not
   shut them out if they will turn. And turn again [kai epistrepsate].
   Definitely turn to God in conduct as well as in mind. That your sins
   may be blotted out [pros to exaliphthenai humOn tas hamartias].
   Articular infinitive (first aorist passive of [exaleiphO], to wipe out,
   rub off, erase, smear out, old verb, but in the N.T. only here and Col
   2:14) with the accusative of general reference and with [pros] and the
   accusative to express purpose. That so [hopOs an]. Final particle with
   [an] and the aorist active subjunctive [elthOsin] (come) and not "when"
   as the Authorized Version has it. Some editors put this clause in verse
   20 (Westcott and Hort, for instance). Seasons of refreshing [kairoi
   anapsuxeOs]. The word [anapsuxis] (from [anapsuchO], to cool again or
   refresh, 2Ti 1:16) is a late word (LXX) and occurs here alone in the
   N.T. Surely repentance will bring "seasons of refreshing from the
   presence of the Lord."

   3:20 And that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you,
   even Jesus [kai aposteilei ton prokecheirismenon humin Christon
   Iesoun]. First aorist active subjunctive with [hopOs an] as in 15:17
   and Lu 2:35. There is little real difference in idea between [hopOs an]
   and [hina an]. There is a conditional element in all purpose clauses.
   The reference is naturally to the second coming of Christ as verse 21
   shows. Knowling admits "that there is a spiritual presence of the
   enthroned Jesus which believers enjoy as a foretaste of the visible and
   glorious Presence of the [Parousia]." Jesus did promise to be with the
   disciples all the days (Mt 28:20), and certainly repentance with
   accompanying seasons of refreshing help get the world ready for the
   coming of the King. The word [prokecheirismenon] (perfect passive
   participle of [procheirizO], from [procheiros], at hand, to take into
   one's hands, to choose) is the correct text here, not
   [prokekerugmenon]. In the N.T. only here and Ac 22:14; 26:16. It is not
   "Jesus Christ" here nor "Christ Jesus," but "the Messiah, Jesus,"
   identifying Jesus with the Messiah. See the Second Epiphany of Jesus
   foretold also in 1Ti 6:15 and the First Epiphany described in 1Pe 1:20.

   3:21 Restoration [apokatastaseOs]. Double compound [apo, kata,
   histemi], here only in the N.T., though common in late writers. In
   papyri and inscriptions for repairs to temples and this phrase occurs
   in Jewish apocalyptic writings, something like the new heaven and the
   new earth of Re 21:1. Paul has a mystical allusion also to the agony of
   nature in Ro 8:20-22. The verb [apokathistemi] is used by Jesus of the
   spiritual and moral restoration wrought by the Baptist as Elijah (Mt
   17:11; Mr 9:12) and by the disciples to Jesus in Ac 1:6. Josephus uses
   the word of the return from captivity and Philo of the restitution of
   inheritances in the year of jubilee. As a technical medical term it
   means complete restoration to health. See a like idea in [palingenesia]
   (renewal, new birth) in Mt 19:28; Tit 3:5. This universalism of Peter
   will be clearer to him after Joppa and Caesarea.

   3:22 Like unto me [hOs eme]. As me, literally; Moses (De 18:14-18)
   claims that God raised him up as a prophet and that another and greater
   one will come, the Messiah. The Jews understood Moses to be a type of
   Christ (Joh 1:21). God spoke to Moses face to face (Ex 33:11) and he
   was the greatest of the prophets (De 34:10).

   3:23 That prophet [tou prophetou ekeinou]. Emphasizes the future
   prophet as on "him" [autou] before "hearken." They had refused to
   "hearken" to Moses and now, alas, many had refused to "hearken" to
   Christ. Shall be utterly destroyed [exolethreuthesetai]. First future
   passive of [exole-] [o] [threuO], a late verb, to destroy utterly [ex],
   only here in the N.T., common in the LXX.

   3:24 From Samuel [apo Samouel]. Schools of prophets arose in his time,
   few before him (1Sa 3:1).

   3:25 Ye [Humeis]. Emphatic position. The covenant which God made [tes
   diathekes hes ho theos dietheto]. Literally, "the covenant which God
   covenanted." [Diatheke] and [dietheto] (second aorist middle indicative
   of [diathemi] are the same root. See on Mt 26:28. The covenant
   (agreement between two, [dia, tithemi] was with Abraham (Ge 12:1-3) and
   repeated at various times (Ge 18:18; 22:18; 26:4, etc.). In Heb 9:15-18
   the word is used both for covenant and will. The genitive relative
   [hes] attracted to case of the antecedent.

   3:26 Unto you first [Humin prOton]. The Jews were first in privilege
   and it was through the Jews that the Messiah was to come for "all the
   families of the earth." His servant [ton paida autou]. As in verse 13,
   the Messiah as God's Servant. To bless you [eulogounta humas]. Present
   active participle to express purpose, blessing you (Robertson, Grammar,
   p. 991). In turning away [en tOi apostrephein]. Articular infinitive in
   the locative case, almost preserved in the English.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4

   4:1 The captain of the temple [ho strategos tou hierou]. Twenty-four
   bands of Levites guarded the temple, one guard at a time. They watched
   the gates. The commander of each band was called captain [strategos].
   Josephus names this captain of the temple police next to the high
   priest (War. VI. 5, 3). The Sadducees [hoi Saddoukaioi]. Most of the
   priests were Sadducees now and all the chief priests since John
   Hyrcanus I deserted the Pharisees (Josephus, Ant. XVII. 10, 6; XVIII.
   1, 4; XX. 9, 1). The Sadducees were slow to line up with the Pharisees
   against Jesus, but they now take the lead against Peter and John. Came
   upon them [epestesan autois]. Second aorist active indicative
   (intransitive). Burst upon them suddenly or stood by them in a hostile
   attitude here (Lu 20:1; 24:4; Ac 6:12; 17:5; 22:20; 23:11).

   4:2 Being sore troubled [diaponoumenoi]. Present passive participle of
   old verb [diaponeO] (perfective use of [dia] to be worked up,
   indignant. In the N.T. only here and 16:8. Because [dia to]. The
   articular infinitive with two accusatives, one the object (the people),
   the other ("they") of general reference. In Jesus [en Iesou]. In the
   case of Jesus, an actual instance of resurrection which the Sadducees
   denied (Mt 22:23). This same use of [en] appears in 1Co 4:6 (in us).
   The Sadducees were also aristocrats and political ecclesiastics who
   disliked popular disturbances. In particular, they resented the claim
   about Jesus whom they had helped crucify.

   4:3 In ward [eis teresin]. Probably in one of the chambers of the
   temple. In safe keeping (from [tereO], to guard). Old word, in the N.T.
   only here and Ac 5:18; 1Co 7:19. So in papyri. Now eventide [hespera
   ede]. Hence no trial could take place before the next day, a regulation
   violated in the case of Jesus.

   4:4 Men [andrOn]. Strictly, men and not women, for [anthrOpos] is the
   term for both men and women. But in Lu 11:31 [andres] seems to include
   both men and women and that is possible here, though by no means
   certain, for see Mt 14:21 where the women and children are expressly
   excepted.

   4:5 Rulers and elders and scribes [tous archontas kai tous presbuterous
   kai tous grammateis]. The three classes composing the Sanhedrin
   (rulers=chief priests who were Sadducees, the scribes usually
   Pharisees, the elders not in either class: 24 priests, 24 elders, 22
   scribes). Were gathered together [sunachthenai]. First aorist passive
   infinitive of [sunagO] with accusative of general reference and the
   subject of [egeneto].

   4:6 Annas [Hannas]. One of the rulers or chief priests, ex-high priest
   (A.D. 7-14) and father-in-law of Caiaphas [Kaiaphas] who was actual
   high priest at that time, though the title clung to Annas as here (both
   so called in Lu 3:2), Caiaphas so by Roman law, Annas so in the opinion
   of the Jews. They with John and Alexander are the leaders among the
   Sadducees in pressing the case against Peter and John.

   4:7 In the midst [en tOi mesOi]. The Sanhedrin sat in a semicircle.
   They inquired [epunthanonto]. Imperfect middle, began to inquire. Or in
   what name [e en poiOi onomati]. As if by some magical formula such as
   exorcists practised (Ac 19:13) as if to catch them by (De 13:1). Have
   ye done this [epoiesate touto humeis]. Note emphatic use of [humeis]
   (ye).

   4:8 Filled with the Holy Spirit [plestheis pneumatos hagiou]. For this
   occasion and so above all fear as in verse 31 and as in 2:4.

   4:9 Concerning a good deed done to an impotent man [epi euergesiai
   anthrOpou asthenous]. Objective genitive. Note [euergesia] (old word,
   in the N.T. only here and 1Ti 6:2), as a benefactor, not a malefactor.
   Skilful turn made by Peter. Is made whole [sesOstai]. Perfect passive
   indicative of [sOzO], stands whole.

   4:10 Be it known [gnOston estO]. Imperative present active third
   singular of [eimi], to be, and the verbal adjective [gnOston]. Whom ye
   crucified [hon humeis estaurOsate]. Too good a chance to miss, and so
   Peter boldly charges the Sanhedrin with responsibility for the death of
   Jesus. Note [humeis] (ye) again. Whom God raised from the dead [hon ho
   theos egeiren ek nekrOn]. Note repetition of [hon] (whom). This is
   God's answer to their act of crucifixion. In him doth this man stand
   [en toutOi houtos paresteken]. Rather (note play on [houtos], "In this
   one [hon, hon] this one stands (present perfect active indicative,
   intransitive)." In Jesus this man stands before you whole [hugies]. It
   was a centre shot.

   4:11 Of you the builders [huph' humOn tOn oikodomOn]. The experts, the
   architects, had rejected Jesus for their building (Ps 118:22) as Jesus
   himself had pointed out (Mt 21:42; Lu 21:17). This very Rejected Stone
   God had made the head of the corner (either the highest corner stone
   right under the roof or the corner stone under the building, Isa 28:16)
   as Jesus showed, as Peter here declares and repeats later (1Pe 2:6f.).

   4:12 Salvation [he sOteria]. The Messianic salvation as in 5:31; 17:11
   and as Jesus meant in Joh 4:22. It is amazing to see Peter speaking
   thus to the Sanhedrin and proclaiming the necessity of salvation [dei
   sOthenai] in the name of Jesus Christ and in no other. If this was true
   then, it is true today. There is no second [heteron] name to go beside
   that of Jesus in India, China, Japan, or America.

   4:13 The boldness [ten parresian]. Telling it all [pan, resia]. See
   also verses 29, 31. Actually Peter had turned the table on the
   Sanhedrin and had arraigned them before the bar of God. Had perceived
   [katalabomenoi]. Second aorist middle participle of [katalambanO],
   common verb to grasp strongly [kata], literally or with the mind
   (especially middle voice), to comprehend. The rulers recalled Peter and
   John from having seen them often with Jesus, probably during the temple
   teaching, etc. They were unlearned [agrammatoi eisin]. Present
   indicative retained in indirect discourse. Unlettered men without
   technical training in the professional rabbinical schools of Hillel or
   Shammai. Jesus himself was so regarded (Joh 7:15, "not having learned
   letters"). And ignorant [kai idiOtai]. Old word, only here in the N.T.
   and 1Co 14:24; 2Co 11:6. It does not mean "ignorant," but a layman, a
   man not in office (a private person), a common soldier and not an
   officer, a man not skilled in the schools, very much like [agrammatos].
   It is from [idios] (one's own) and our "idiosyncracy" is one with an
   excess of such a trait, while "idiot" (this very word) is one who has
   nothing but his idiosyncracy. Peter and John were men of ability and of
   courage, but they did not belong to the set of the rabbis. They
   marvelled [ethaumazon]. Imperfect (inchoative) active, began to wonder
   and kept it up. Took knowledge of them [epeginOskon autous]. Imperfect
   (inchoative) active again, they began to recognize them as men that
   they had seen with Jesus.

   4:14 They could say nothing against it [ouden eichon anteipein].
   Imperfect again, they kept on having nothing to say against it. The
   lame man was standing there before their eyes in proof of what Peter
   had said.

   4:15 They conferred among themselves [suneballon pros allelous].
   Imperfect active again. With Peter and John and the lame man outside,
   they began to compare [sun, ballO] notes and take stock of their
   predicament.

   4:16 What shall we do? [Ti poiesOmen]. Deliberative aorist active
   subjunctive (ingressive and urgent aorist). Notable miracle [gnOston
   semeion]. Or sign. It was useless to deny it with the man there. We
   cannot deny it [ou dunametha arneisthai]. That is, it will do no good.

   4:17 That it spread no further [hina me epi pleion dianemethei]. First
   aorist passive subjunctive of [dianemO], to distribute with [hina me],
   negative purpose. Let us threaten them [apeilesOmetha autois].
   Hortatory aorist middle subjunctive of [apeileO], old verb (note middle
   voice). In the N.T. only here and 1Pe 2:23. That they speak henceforth
   to no man in this name [meketi lalein epi tOi onomati toutOi medeni
   anthrOpOn]. Indirect command with the infinitive and double negative
   [meketi, medeni]. They will not say "Jesus," but make a slur at "this
   name," contemptuous use of [houtos], though they apparently do mention
   the name "Jesus" in verse 18.

   4:18 Not to speak at all [katholou me phtheggesthai]. Same construction
   as above, infinitive in indirect command with negative [me] (and
   [mede].

   4:20 For we cannot but speak [ou dunametha gar hemeis--me lalein]. Both
   negatives hold here, "For we (note emphatic [hemeis] are not able not
   to speak" (what we saw and heard). This is defiance of the civil and
   ecclesiastical authorities that was justified, for the temple
   authorities stepped in between the conscience and God. Peter and John
   were willing to pay the price of this defiance with their lives. This
   is the courage of martyrs through all the ages.

   4:21 When they had further threatened them [prosapeilesamenoi]. The
   "further" is in "pros" (in addition), Finding nothing how they might
   punish them [meden heuriskontes to pOs kolasOntai autous]. Note the
   article "to" before [pOs] (how), "the how." Aorist middle deliberative
   subjunctive [kolasOntai] in indirect question after [pOs] from
   [kolazO], to lop [kolos], lopped), to curb, to prune, to correct, to
   punish. Old verb, in the N.T. only here and 2Pe 2:9. Glorified God
   [edoxazon ton theon]. Imperfect active, kept on glorifying God while
   the Sanhedrin were threatening Peter and John. It was to laugh at the
   helplessness of the Sanhedrin.

   4:22 Was wrought [gegonei]. Second past perfect active without augment
   from [ginomai].

   4:23 To their own company [pros tous idious]. Their own people as in
   Joh 1:11; 13:1; Ac 24:23; 1Ti 5:8; Tit 3:14, not merely the apostles
   (all the disciples). In spite of Peter's courageous defiance he and
   John told the brotherhood all that had been said by the Sanhedrin. They
   had real apprehension of the outcome.

   4:24 With one accord [homothumadon]. A concert of voices as already
   seen by the word in 1:14; 2:46 and later in 5:12; 7:57; 15:25. O Lord
   [Despota]. Our word despot. Old word for relation of master to slaves
   or household servants (1Ti 6:1; 2Ti 2:21; Tit 2:9; 1Pe 2:18). Simeon
   thus addressed God (Lu 2:29). So in 2Pe 2:1; Jude 1:4; Re 6:10. See
   "slaves" in verse 29.

   4:25 By the mouth of our father David [tou patros hemOn dia pneumatos
   hagiou stomatos Daueid]. From Ps 2:1f. here ascribed to David.
   Baumgarten suggests that the whole company sang the second Psalm and
   then Peter applied it to this emergency. The Greek MSS. do not have
   [dia] (by) here before [stomatos], but only [dia] before [pneumatos
   hagiou] (the Holy Spirit). Hort calls this a "primitive error" perhaps
   due to an early scribe who omitted this second [dia] so close to the
   first [dia] (Robertson, Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the
   N.T., p. 238). A small list of such primitive errors is there given as
   suggested by Dr. Hort. Why [hina ti]. This Greek idiom calls for
   [genetai] (second aorist middle subjunctive), That what may happen. The
   Gentiles [ethne]. So always in LXX, while [laoi] (peoples) can include
   Jews. Did rage [ephruaxan]. First aorist active indicative of
   [phruassO], late word, to neigh like a horse, to prance or stamp the
   ground, to put on lofty airs. Only here in the N.T. in this quotation
   from Ps 2:1. Imagine [emeletesan]. First aorist active indicative of
   [meletaO]. Old verb from [melete] (care), to practise, to caution, as
   orators and rhetoricians. Only here in the N.T. in this quotation.

   4:26 Set themselves in array [parestesan]. Literally, stood by. Against
   his Anointed [kata tou Christou autou]. Against his Messiah, his
   Christ.

   4:27 Both Herod and Pontios Pilate [HerOides te kai Pontius Peilatos].
   Luke alone (Lu 23:12) tells of the reconciliation between Herod and
   Pilate at the trial of Jesus. So Peter and the rest interpret this
   prophecy as directly fulfilled in their conduct towards Jesus Christ.
   Whom thou didst anoint [hon echrisas]. As in verse 26 (cf. Lu 4:18; Isa
   61:1). Inaugurated as King Messiah.

   4:28 Foreordained [proOrisen]. First aorist active indicative of
   [proorizO], "They rise above sight and seem to see the Hand which
   'shapes men's ends, rough hew them how they will'" (Furneaux).

   4:29 And now [kai ta nun]. "And as to (accusative of general reference)
   the now things (the present situation)." Only in the Acts in the N.T.
   (5:38; 17:30; 20:32; 27:22). Grant [dos]. Second aorist active
   imperative of [didOmi], urgency of the aorist, Do it now. To speak thy
   word with all boldness [meta parresias pases lalein ton logon sou].
   Literally, "with all boldness to go on speaking (present active
   infinitive) thy word." Peter and John had defied the Sanhedrin in verse
   20, but all the same and all the more they pray for courage in deed to
   live up to their brave words. A wholesome lesson.

   4:30 While thou stretchest forth thy hand [en tOi ten cheira ekteinein
   se]. Luke's favourite idiom, "In the stretching out (articular present
   active infinitive) the hand as to thee" (accusative of general
   reference), the second allusion to God's "hand" in this prayer (verse
   28). To heal [eis iasin]. For healing. See verse 22. And that signs and
   wonders may be done [kai semeia kai terata ginesthai]. Either to be
   taken as in the same construction as [ekteinein] with [en tOi] as
   Revised Version has it here or to be treated as subordinate purpose to
   [en tOi ekteinein] (as Knowling, Page, Wendt, Hackett). The latter most
   likely true. They ask for a visible sign or proof that God has heard
   this prayer for courage to be faithful even unto death.

   4:31 The place was shaken [esaleuthe ho topos]. By an earthquake most
   likely as in 16:26, but none the less a token of God's presence and
   power (Ps 114:7; Isa 2:19, 21; Heb 12:26f.). Were gathered together
   [esan sunegmenoi]. Periphrastic past perfect passive of [sunagO]. They
   spake [elaloun]. Imperfect active indicative, began to speak, after
   being filled [eplesthesan], aorist passive indicative) with the Holy
   Spirit. Luke uses the very words of the prayer in verse 29 to describe
   their conduct.

   4:32 Of one heart and soul [kardia kai psuche mia]. It is not possible
   to make sharp distinction between heart and soul here (see Mr 12:30),
   only that there was harmony in thought and affection. But the English
   translation is curiously unlike the Greek original. "There was one
   heart and soul (nominative case, not genitive as the English has it) in
   the multitude [tou plethous], subjective genitive) of those who
   believed." Not one of them [oude heis]. More emphatic than [oudeis],
   "not even one." Common [koina]. In the use of their property, not in
   the possession as Luke proceeds to explain. The word [koinos] is kin to
   [sun] (together with) = [xun] (Epic) and so [xunos=koinos]. See this
   word already in 2:44. The idea of unclean (Ac 10:15) is a later
   development from the original notion of common to all.

   4:33 Gave their witness [apedidoun to marturion]. Imperfect active of
   [apodidOmi], old verb to give back, to pay back a debt (Lu 7:42), but a
   late omega form instead of the usual [apedidosan]. They kept on giving
   their witness with power after the answer to their prayer (verse 31).
   Of the resurrection [tes anastaseOs]. It was on this issue that the
   Sadducees had arrested them (4:1-3).

   4:34 That lacked [endees]. Literally, in need, old adjective, here only
   in the N.T. Were [huperchon]. Imperfect active of [huparchO], to exist.
   Sold them and brought [pOlountes epheron]. Present active participle
   and imperfect active indicative. Selling they brought from time to
   time, as there was occasion by reason of need. Hence the wants were
   kept supplied. Laid them [etithoun]. Imperfect active again,
   repetition, of [tithemi], late omega form for the usual [etithesan].

   4:35 Distribution was made [diedideto]. Imperfect passive of
   [diadidOmi], late omega form for [diedidoto] (the stem vowel [o]
   displaced by [e]. Impersonal use of the verb here. According as any one
   had need [kathoti an tis chreian eichen]. Imperfect active of [echO]
   with [kathoti] and [an] with the notion of customary repetition in a
   comparative clause (Robertson, Grammar, p. 967).

   4:36 Barnabas [Barnabas]. His name was Joseph (correct text, and not
   Jesus) and he is mentioned as one illustration of those in verse 34 who
   selling brought the money. The apostles gave him the nickname Barnabas
   by which later he was known because of this noble deed. This fact
   argues that all did not actually sell, but were ready to do so if
   needed. Possibly Joseph had a larger estate than some others also. The
   meaning of the nickname is given by Luke as "son of consolation or
   exhortation" [huios parakleseOs]. Doubtless his gifts as a preacher lay
   along this same line. Rackham thinks that the apostles gave him this
   name when he was recognized as a prophet. In Ac 11:23 the very word
   [parekalei] (exhorted) is used of Barnabas up at Antioch. He is the
   type of preacher described by Paul in 1Co 14:3. Encouragement is the
   chief idea in [paraklesis] though exhortation, comfort, consolation are
   used to render it (Ac 9:31; 13:15; 15:31). See also 16:9; 20:12. It is
   not necessary to think that the apostles coined the name Barnabas for
   Joseph which originally may have come from [Barnebous] (Deissmann,
   Bible Studies, pp. 308-10), son of Nebo, or even the Hebrew Bar Nebi
   (son of a prophet). But, whatever the origin, the popular use is given
   by Luke. He was even called apostle along with Paul (Ac 14:14) in the
   broad sense of that word.

   4:37 Having a held [huparchontos autOi agrou]. Genitive absolute with
   present active participle of [huparchO] and dative of possession. Sold
   it and brought [pOlesas enegken]. Aorist active participle of [pOleO]
   and second aorist active indicative of [pherO] because a single
   definite instance. So also with [etheken] (laid), first aorist active.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 5

   5:1 Sold [epOlesen]. Aorist active indicative again, for a single case.

   5:2 Kept back [enosphisato]. First aorist middle indicative of
   [nosphizO], old verb from [nosphi], afar, apart, and so to set apart,
   to separate for oneself, but only here, verse 3; Tit 2:10 in the N.T.
   His wife also being privy to it [suneiduies kai tes gunaikos]. Genitive
   absolute with second perfect participle of [sunoida], to know together
   with one, "his wife also knowing it together with him." Brought a
   certain part [enegkas meros ti]. Aorist active participle of [pherO],
   for a definite act. The praise of Joseph was too much for Ananias, but
   he was not willing to turn over all. He wanted praise for giving all
   and yet he took care of himself by keeping some. Thus he started the
   Ananias Club that gave a new meaning to his lovely name (God is
   gracious).

   5:3 Filled [eplerOsen]. The very verb used of the filling by the Holy
   Spirit (4:31). Satan the adversary is the father of lies (Joh 8:44). He
   had entered into Judas (Lu 22:3; Joh 13:27) and now he has filled the
   heart of Ananias with a lie. To lie to the Holy Spirit [pseusasthai se
   to pneuma to hagion]. Infinitive (aorist middle) of purpose with
   accusative of general reference [se] and the accusative of the person
   (object) as often in Greek writers, though here only in the N.T. with
   this verb. Usual dative of the person in verse 4 [anthrOpois], men,
   [tOi theOi], God). The Holy Spirit had been given them to guide them
   into truth (Joh 15:13).

   5:4 Whiles it remained [menon]. Present active participle of mend,
   unsold, Peter means. After it was sold [prathen]. First aorist passive
   of [pipraskO], to sell. How is that thou hast conceived [Ti hoti
   ethou]. Quid est quod. See Lu 2:49. See also Ac 5:9. Second aorist
   middle indicative second person singular of [tithemi]. The devil filled
   his heart (verse 3), but all the same Ananias did it too and is wholly
   responsible.

   5:5 Hearing [akouOn]. Present active participle of [akouO], while
   hearing. Fell down [pesOn]. Second aorist active participle of [piptO],
   fell all of a sudden while listening. Gave up the ghost [exepsuxen].
   First aorist active indicative of [ekpsuchO], late verb in LXX and
   Hippocrates, to breathe out, to expire. In the N.T. only here, verse
   10; 12:23. It is needless to blame Peter for the death of Ananias. He
   had brought the end upon himself. It was the judgment of God.
   Physically the nervous shock could have caused the collapse.

   5:6 The young men [hoi neOteroi]. Literally the younger men (contrast
   with [hoi presbuteroi], the elder men). Same as [neaniskoi] in verse 10
   and so no order in the young church. Perhaps these young men were
   acting as ushers or actual pallbearers. Wrapped him round
   [sunesteilan]. First aorist active indicative of [sustellO], old verb,
   to draw together, or contract (1Co 7:29), to roll together, to wrap
   with bandages, to enshroud as here. Nowhere else in the N.T. Frequent
   in medical writers. They may have used their own mantles. The time for
   burial was short in Jerusalem for sanitary reasons and to avoid
   ceremonial defilement.

   5:7 And it was about the space of three hours after [egeneto de hOs
   hOrOn triOn diastema]. Literally "Now there came an interval
   [diastema], distance, space between) of about [hOs] three hours." When
   [kai]. This use of [kai] after [egeneto] is characteristic of Luke's
   style in the Gospel. Not knowing [me eiduia]. Feminine singular of
   second perfect active participle of [oida]. [Me] usual negative of the
   participle in the Koine.

   5:8 For so much [tosoutou]. Genitive of price. Perhaps Peter pointed to
   the pile of money at the feet of the apostles ( verse 2). The use of
   [ei] in direct questions appears in Luke (Lu 13:23; 22:49) as in the
   LXX like the Hebrew im and in Ac 1:6; 19:2, etc.

   5:9 Ye have agreed together [sunephOnethe humin]. First aorist passive
   indicative of [sumphOneO] (to voice together, symphony), impersonal
   with dative; It was agreed together by you (or for you). "Your souls
   were allured together respecting this deceit" (Vincent). To tempt the
   Spirit of the Lord [peirasai to pneuma kuriou]. Like "Thou shalt not
   tempt the Lord thy God." It was close to the unpardonable sin which was
   attributing the manifest work of the Holy Spirit to Beelzebub. The feet
   [hoi podes]. Graphic picture by Peter as he heard the steps of the
   young men at the door.

   5:10 Immediately [parachrema]. Hence her death was regarded as
   supernatural like that of Ananias. By her husband [pros ton andra
   autes]. Face to face to her husband.

   5:11 Upon the whole church [eph' holen ten ekklesian]. Here [ekklesia]
   for the first time in Acts of the believers in Jerusalem. Twice already
   in the Gospels, once of the whole body of believers or the Kingdom (Mt
   16:18), the other of the local body (Mt 18:17). In Ac 7:38 it is used
   of the whole congregation of Israel while in 19:32 it is used of a
   public assembly in Ephesus. But already in Ac 8:3 it is applied to the
   church which Saul was persecuting in their homes when not assembled. So
   here the etymological meaning of "assembly" disappears for "the church"
   were now the scattered saints hiding in their separate homes. The whole
   body of believers in Jerusalem and all who heard of the fate of Ananias
   and Sapphira (beautiful, her name means) were in awe and dread. It was
   already a dangerous thing to be a follower of Christ unless one was
   willing to walk straight.

   5:12 Were wrought [egineto]. Imperfect middle, wrought from time to
   time. With one accord [homothumadon]. As already in 1:14; 2:46; 4:24
   and later 7:57; 8:6; 12:20; 15:25; 18:21; 19:29, old adverb and only in
   Acts in the N.T. Here "all" is added. In Solomon's Porch again as in
   3:11 which see.

   5:13 Durst [etolma]. Imperfect active of [tolmaO], old verb, not to
   fear or shun through fear, boldly to take a stand. The fate of Ananias
   and Sapphira continued to hold many in check. Join [kollasthai].
   Present middle infinitive of [kollaO], old verb to cleave to like glue
   as in Lu 15:15 which see. Seven times in Acts (9:26; 10:28; 17:34). The
   outsiders (the rest) preferred, many of them, to remain outside for the
   present, especially the rulers. Howbeit the people [all'--ho laos].
   Probably individuals among the people, the populace as distinct from
   the rulers and hostile outsiders.

   5:14 Were the more added [mallon prosetithento]. Rather [mallon]
   instead of decrease as one might expect. Imperfect passive indicative
   of [prostithemi] common [mi] verb, kept on being added. Both of men and
   women [andrOn te kai gunaikOn]. The distinction between [andres] and
   [gunaikes] and to be considered in connection with [andres] in 4:4
   which see.

   5:15 Insomuch that [hOste]. With the present infinitive [ekpherein] and
   [tithenai], regular Greek idiom for result. Into the streets [eis tas
   plateias]. Supply [hodous] (ways), into the broad ways. On beds and
   couches [epi klinariOn kai krabattOn]. Little beds [klinaria]
   diminutive of [kline] and camp beds or pallets (see on Mr 2:4, 9, 11).
   As Peter came by [erchomenou Petrou]. Genitive absolute with present
   middle participle. At the least his shadow might overshadow [kan he
   skia episkiasei]. Future active indicative with [hina] (common with
   [hopOs] in ancient Greek) and [kan] (crasis for [kai ean] = even if),
   even if only the shadow. The word for shadow [skia], like our "sky") is
   repeated in the verb and preserved in our "overshadow." There was, of
   course, no virtue or power in Peter's shadow. That was faith with
   superstition, of course, just as similar cases in the Gospels occur (Mt
   9:20; Mr 6:56; Joh 9:5) and the use of Paul's handkerchief (Ac 19:12).
   God honours even superstitious faith if it is real faith in him. Few
   people are wholly devoid of superstition.

   5:16 Came together [sunercheto]. Imperfect middle, kept on coming.
   Round about [perix]. Old adverb, strengthened form of [peri], only here
   in the N.T. Vexed [ochloumenous]. Present passive participle of
   [ochleO], to excite a mob [ochlos] against one, to trouble, annoy. Old
   word, only here in the N.T., though [enochleO] in Lu 6:18. Were healed
   every one [etherapeuonto hapantes]. Imperfect passive, were healed one
   at a time, repetition.

   5:17 Which is the sect of the Sadducees [he ousa hairesis tOn
   SaddoukaiOn]. Literally, "the existing sect of the Sadducees" or "the
   sect which is of the Sadducees," [he] being the article, not the
   relative. [Hairesis] means a choosing, from [haireomai], to take for
   oneself, to choose, then an opinion chosen or tenet (possibly 2Pe 2:1),
   then parties or factions (Gal 5:20; 1Co 11:19; possibly 2Pe 2:1). It is
   applied here to the Sadducees; to the Pharisees in Ac 15:5; 26:5; to
   the Christians in 24:5-14; 28:22. Already Luke has stated that the
   Sadducees started the persecution of Peter and John (Ac 4:1f.). Now it
   is extended to "the apostles" as a whole since Christianity has spread
   more rapidly in Jerusalem than before it began.

   5:18 With jealousy [zelou]. Genitive case. Old word from zeO, to boil,
   our zeal. In itself it means only warmth, ardour, zeal, but for a bad
   cause or from a bad motive, jealousy, envy, rivalry results (Ac 13:45).
   Common in the epistles. In public ward [en teresei demosiai]. As in 4:3
   only with [demosiai] (public) added, in the public prison, perhaps not
   the "common" prison, but any prison is bad enough. In verse 19 it is
   called "the prison" [tes phulakes], the guardhouse.

   5:20 And stand [kai stathentes]. First aorist passive participle
   (intransitive, ingressive aorist), take a stand. Bold and pictorial
   command. All the words of this life [panta ta rhemata tes zOes tautes].
   Not just a Hebraism for "all these words of life." Probably "this life"
   which the Sadducees deny and of which the angel is now speaking, this
   eternal life. (Joh 6:63,68; 1Co 15:19).

   5:21 About daybreak [hupo ton orthron]. From [ornumi], to stir up, to
   arouse, so the dawn (Lu 24:1; Joh 8:2). Old word, but in the N.T. only
   these three passages. "Under the dawn" or "about dawn." Sub lucem. The
   temple doors would be open for early worshippers and traffickers (Joh
   2:14). Taught [edidaskon]. Imperfect active, began to teach. The
   council [to sunedrion]. The Sanhedrin. The senate [ten gerousian]. From
   [gerOn], an old man, just as the Latin senatus is from senex, old. Like
   the [gerontes] in Homer and the Elder Statesmen in Japan. Apparently
   the senate of the people were also part of the Sanhedrin and the use of
   "and" [kai] is explanatory and adds this item in particular. Page
   thinks that this group of elders were not members of the Sanhedrin at
   all. To the prison house [eis to desmOterion], another word for prison
   [teresis demosia] in verse 18, [he phulake] in verse 19). See also
   verses 22, 23, 25. This from [desmos], bond, and [tereO], to keep,
   place where bound men are kept.

   5:22 The officers [hoi huperetai]. Under-rowers, literally (Mt 5:25).
   The servants or officers who executed the orders of the Sanhedrin. Shut
   [kekleismenon]. Perfect passive participle of [kleiO]. Shut tight.
   Standing at the doors [hestOtas epi tOn thurOn]. Graphic picture of the
   sentinels at the prison doors.

   5:24 They were much perplexed [dieporoun]. Imperfect active of
   [diaporeO] old verb by Luke only in the N.T. See already on Ac 2:12.
   They continued puzzled. Whereunto this would grow [ti an genoito
   touto]. More exactly, As to what this would become. Second aorist
   middle optative of [ginomai] with [an], the conclusion of a condition
   of the fourth class (undetermined with less likelihood of
   determination), the unexpressed condition being "if the thing should be
   allowed to go on." The indirect question simply retains the optative
   with [an] (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1021, 1044). If they had only known
   how this grain of mustard seed would grow into the greatest tree on
   earth and how dwarfed the tree of Judaism would be beside it!

   5:26 Brought [egen]. Imperfect active of [agO], was bringing (leading),
   slowly no doubt, and solemnly. But without violence [ou meta bias].
   Literally, not with violence. For they feared [ephobounto gar].
   Imperfect middle, still feared, kept on fearing. Lest they be stoned
   [me lithasthOsin]. Negative purpose with [me] (like [hina me], probably
   with "not with violence," though possible with "they feared." They
   handled the apostles gently for fear of being stoned themselves by the
   people. First aorist passive subjunctive of [lithazO] (from [lithos],
   stone), old verb to pelt with stones (Ac 14:19; Joh 10:31-33).

   5:27 They set them [estesan]. First aorist active indicative
   (transitive) of [histemi].

   5:28 We straitly charged [Paraggeliai pareggeilamen]. Like the Hebrew
   idiom (common in the LXX), though found in Greek, with charging
   (instrumental case) we charged (cf. same idiom in Lu 22:15). Somewhat
   like the cognate accusative. The command referred to occurs in Ac 4:17,
   18 and the refusal of Peter and John in 4:20. To bring upon us
   [epagagein eph' hemas]. Note repetition of [epi]. Second aorist active
   infinitive of [epagO], old verb, but in the N.T. only here and 2Pe 2:1,
   5. The Sanhedrin gladly took the blood of Christ on their heads and
   their children to Pilate (Mt 27:25). Paul tried to save the Jews (Ac
   18:6; 22:20). "This man" [tou anthrOpou toutou]. Contemptuous slur and
   refusal to call the name of Jesus as in the Talmud later.

   5:29 We must [dei]. Moral necessity left them no choice. They stood
   precisely where Peter and John were when before the Sanhedrin before
   (Ac 4:20). Obey [peitharchein]. Old verb from [peithomai] and [arche],
   to obey a ruler. Only by Luke and Paul in the N.T.

   5:30 Ye slew [diecheirisasthe]. First aorist middle indicative of
   [diacheirizomai], old verb from [dia] and [cheir] (hand), to take in
   hand, manage, to lay hands on, manhandle, kill. In the N.T. only here
   and Ac 26:21. Hanging him upon a tree [kremasantes epi xulou]. First
   aorist active participle of [kremannumi] [kremannuO] seen already in Mt
   18:6 and Lu 23:39). Peter refers to De 21:23 as Paul does in Ga 3:13,
   the curse pronounced on every one who "hangs upon a tree."

   5:31 Exalt [upsOsen] In contrast to their murder of Christ as in 2:23f.
   Peter repeats his charges with increased boldness. With his right hand
   [tei dexiai autou]. So instrumental case, or at his right hand
   (locative case), or even "to his right hand" (dative case) as in 2:33.
   Prince and Saviour [archegon kai sOtera]. See on 3:15. Clearly "Prince"
   here. To give [tou dounai]. Genitive of articular infinitive (second
   aorist active of [didOmi] of purpose.

   5:32 We are witnesses [hemeis esmen martures]. As in 2:32. Things
   [rhematOn]. Literally, sayings, but like the Hebrew dabhar for "word"
   it is here used for "things." And so is the Holy Ghost [kai to pneuma
   to hagion]. The word for "is" [estin] is not in the Greek, but this is
   plainly the meaning. Peter claims the witness of the Holy Spirit to the
   raising of Jesus Christ, God's Son, by the Father.

   5:33 Were cut to the heart [dieprionto]. Imperfect passive of [diapriO]
   old verb [dia, priO], to saw in two [dia], to cut in two (to the
   heart). Here it is rage that cuts into their hearts, not conviction of
   sin as in Ac 2:37. Only here and Ac 7:54 (after Stephen's speech) in
   the N.T. (cf. Simeon's prophecy in Lu 2:35). Were minded [eboulonto].
   Imperfect middle of [boulomai]. They were plotting and planning to kill
   [anelein], as in Ac 2:23; Lu 23:33 which see) then and there. The point
   in 4:7 was whether the apostles deserved stoning for curing the cripple
   by demoniacal power, but here it was disobedience to the command of the
   Sanhedrin which was not a capital offence. "They were on the point of
   committing a grave judicial blunder" (Furneaux).

   5:34 Gamaliel [Gamaliel]. The grandson of Hillel, teacher of Paul (Ac
   22:3), later president of the Sanhedrin, and the first of the seven
   rabbis termed "Rabban." It is held by some that he was one of the
   doctors who heard the Boy Jesus in the temple (Lu 2:47) and that he was
   a secret disciple like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, but there is
   no evidence of either position. Besides, he appears here as a loyal
   Pharisee and "a doctor of the law" [nomodidaskalos]. This word appears
   already in Lu 5:17 of the Pharisaic doctors bent on criticizing Jesus,
   which see. Paul uses it of Judaizing Christians (1Ti 1:7). Like other
   great rabbis he had a great saying: "Procure thyself a teacher, avoid
   being in doubt; and do not accustom thyself to give tithes by guess."
   He was a man of judicial temper and not prone to go off at a tangent,
   though his brilliant young pupil Saul went to the limit about Stephen
   without any restraint on the part of Gamaliel so far as the record
   goes. Gamaliel champions the cause of the apostles as a Pharisee to
   score a point against the Sadducees. He acts as a theological
   opportunist, not as a disciple of Christ. He felt that a temporizing
   policy was best. There are difficulties in this speech of Gamaliel and
   it is not clear how Luke obtained the data for the address. It is, of
   course, possible that Saul was present and made notes of it for Luke
   afterwards. Had in honour of all the people [timios panti tOi laOi].
   Ethical dative. [Timios] from [time], old word meaning precious, dear.
   The men [tous anthrOpous]. Correct text as in verse 35, not "the
   apostles" as Textus Receptus.

   5:35 Take heed [prosechete heautois]. Hold your mind [noun],
   unexpressed) for or on yourselves (dative case), the usual idiom.

   5:36 Theudas [Theudas]. Luke represents Gamaliel here about A.D. 35 as
   speaking of a man who led a revolt before that of Judas the Galilean in
   connection with the enrolment under Quirinius (Cyrenius) in A.D. 6. But
   Josephus (Ant. XX. 5, 1) tells of a Theudas who led a similar
   insurrection in the reign of Claudius about A.D. 44 or 45. Josephus
   (Ant. XVIII. 1, 6; XX. 5, 2; War ii. 8, 1 and 17, 8) also describes
   Judas the Galilean or Gaulonite and places him about A.D. 6. It is not
   certain that Josephus and Luke (Gamaliel) refer to the same Theudas as
   the name is an abbreviation of Theodosus, a common name. "Josephus
   gives an account of four men named Simon who followed each other within
   forty years, and of three named Judas within ten years, who were all
   instigators of rebellion" (Hackett). If the same Theudas is meant, then
   either Josephus or Luke (Gamaliel) has the wrong historical order. In
   that case one will credit Luke or Josephus according to his estimate of
   the two as reliable historians. To be somebody [einai tina]. Indirect
   assertion with the infinitive and the accusative of general reference
   [heauton] and [tina], predicate accusative. [Tina] could be "anybody"
   or "somebody" according to context, clearly "somebody" of importance
   here. Joined themselves [proseklithe]. Correct text and not
   [prosekollethe] (Textus Receptus). First aorist passive indicative of
   [prosklinO], old verb to lean towards, to incline towards. Here only in
   the N.T. Was slain [aneirethe]. First aorist passive of [anaireO] (cf.
   verse 33). Obeyed [epeithonto]. Imperfect middle, kept on obeying. Were
   dispersed [dieluthesan]. First aorist passive indicative (effective
   aorist) of [dialuO], old verb to dissolve, to go to pieces. Here only
   in the N.T.

   5:37 Of the enrolment [tes apographes]. Described by Josephus (Ant. XV.
   1, 1). The same word used by Luke of the first enrolment started by
   Augustus B.C. 8 to 6 (Lu 2:2). See the discussion on Lu 2:2. This is
   the second enrolment in the fourteen year cycle carried on for
   centuries as shown by numerous dated papyri. Ramsay (The Bearing of
   Recent Discovery on the Trustworthiness of the N.T.) has produced proof
   from inscriptions that Quirinius was twice in Syria as Luke reports
   (Robertson, Luke the Historian in the Light of Research). Drew away
   [apestese]. Causative sense of the first aorist active indicative of
   [aphistemi], made people [laon], no need of "some of the") to revolt
   (apostatize) with him. He also [kakeinos], crasis for [kai ekeinos].
   That one, also. Were scattered abroad [dieskorpisthesan]. First aorist
   (effective) passive indicative of [diaskorpizO], old verb to disperse.
   Used of sheep (Mr 14:27), of property (Lu 15:13). Aorist here after
   imperfect [epeithonto] as in verse 36.

   5:38 Refrain from [apostete apo]. Second aorist (ingressive) active
   imperative of [aphistemi] of verse 37. Do ye stand off from these men.
   "Hands off" was the policy of Gamaliel. For if--be [hoti ean--ei].
   [Hoti] gives the reason for the advice. Gamaliel presents two
   alternatives in terms of two conditional clauses. The first one is
   stated as a condition of the third class, [ean] with the present
   subjunctive [ei], undetermined with prospect of determination. Assuming
   that it is from men, "it will be overthrown" [kataluthesetai], first
   future passive of [kataluO], to loosen down like a falling house) as
   was true of the following of Theudas and Judas the Galilean.

   5:39 But if it is of God [ei de ek theou estin]. The second alternative
   is a condition of the first class, determined as fulfilled, [ei] with
   the present indicative. By the use of this idiom Gamaliel does put the
   case more strongly in favor of the apostles than against them. This
   condition assumes that the thing is so without affirming it to be true.
   On the basis of this alternative Gamaliel warns the Sanhedrin that they
   cannot "overthrow" [katalusai] these men for they in that case must
   "overthrow" God, lest haply ye be found [me pote--hurethete], negative
   purpose with first aorist passive subjunctive) even to be fighting
   against God [kai theomachoi], late adjective from [theos] and
   [machomai], in LXX and here only in the N.T.).

   5:40 To him they agreed [epeisthesan autOi]. First aorist passive
   indicative of [peithO], to persuade, the passive to be persuaded by, to
   listen to, to obey. Gamaliel's shrewd advice scored as against the
   Sadducaic contention (verse 17). Not to speak [me lalein]. The
   Sanhedrin repeated the prohibition of 4:18 which the apostles had
   steadily refused to obey. The Sanhedrin stood by their guns, but
   refused to shoot. It was a "draw" with Gamaliel as tactical victor over
   the Sadducees. Clearly now the disciples were set free because only the
   Sadducees had become enraged while the Pharisees held aloof.

   5:41 They therefore [hoi men oun]. No answering [de]. They were counted
   worthy to suffer dishonour for the Name [katexiOthesan huper tou
   onomatos atimasthenai]. First aorist passive indicative of [kataxioO],
   old verb to count worthy. Three times in N.T. (Lu 20:35; Ac 5:41; 2Th
   1:5). First aorist passive infinitive of [atimazO], old verb to make
   one dishonoured [atimos]. Forms here an oxymoron [oxus], sharp,
   [moros], foolish) pointedly foolish saying "which is witty or
   impressive through sheer contradiction or paradox as laborious
   idleness, sublime indifference" (Vincent). The apostles felt honoured
   by dishonour. Note the same use of "the Name" as in Jas 2:7; 3Jo 1:7.
   With the Jews this absolute use of "the Name" meant Jehovah. The
   Christians now apply it to Jesus.

   5:42 Every day [pasan hemeran]. Accusative of extent of time, all
   through every day. In the temple and at home [en tOi hierOi kai kat'
   oikon]. This was a distinct triumph to go back to the temple where they
   had been arrested (verse 25) and at home or from house to house, as it
   probably means (cf. 2:46). It was a great day for the disciples in
   Jerusalem. They ceased not [ouk epauonto]. Imperfect middle. They kept
   it up. Jesus as the Christ [ton Christon Iesoun]. Jesus is the direct
   object of the participles [didaskontes] (teaching) and
   [euaggelizomenoi] (preaching or evangelizing) while "the Christ" [ton
   Christon] is the predicate accusative. These words give the substance
   of the early apostolic preaching as these opening chapters of Acts
   show, that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah of promise. Gamaliel had
   opened the prison doors for them and they took full advantage of the
   opportunity that now was theirs.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 6

   6:1 When the number of the disciples was multiplying [plethunontOn tOn
   mathetOn]. Genitive absolute of [plethunO], old verb from [plethos],
   fulness, to increase. The new freedom from the intercession of Gamaliel
   was bearing rich fruit. A murmuring of the Grecian Jews [goggusmos tOn
   HellenistOn]. Late onomatopoetic word (LXX) from the late verb
   [gogguzO], to mutter, to murmur. The substantive occurs also in Joh
   7:12; Php 2:14; 1Pe 4:9. It is the secret grumblings that buzz away
   till they are heard. These "Grecian Jews" or Hellenists are members of
   the church in Jerusalem who are Jews from outside of Palestine like
   Barnabas from Cyprus. These Hellenists had points of contact with the
   Gentile world without having gone over to the habits of the Gentiles,
   the Jews of the Western Dispersion. They spoke Greek. Against the
   Hebrews [pros tous Ebraious]. The Jewish Christians from Jerusalem and
   Palestine. The Aramaean Jews of the Eastern Dispersion are usually
   classed with the Hebrew (speaking Aramaic) as distinct from the Grecian
   Jews or Hellenists. Were neglected [paretheOrounto]. Imperfect passive
   of [paratheOreO], old verb, to examine things placed beside [para] each
   other, to look beyond [para] also), to overlook, to neglect. Here only
   in the N.T. These widows may receive daily [kathemerinei], late
   adjective from [kath' hemeran], only here in the N.T.) help from the
   common fund provided for all who need it (Ac 4:32-37). The temple funds
   for widows were probably not available for those who have now become
   Christians. Though they were all Christians here concerned, yet the
   same line of cleavage existed as among the other Jews (Hebrew or
   Aramaean Jews and Hellenists). It is not here said that the murmuring
   arose among the widows, but because of them. Women and money occasion
   the first serious disturbance in the church life. There was evident
   sensitiveness that called for wisdom.

   6:2 The multitude [to plethos]. The whole church, not just the 120. Fit
   [areston]. Pleasing, verbal adjective from [areskO], to please, old
   word, but in the N.T. only here and Ac 12:3; Joh 8:29; 1Jo 3:22. Non
   placet. Should forsake [kataleipsantas]. Late first aorist active
   participle for usual second aorist [katalipontas] from [kataleipO], to
   leave behind. Serve tables [diakonein trapezais]. Present active
   infinitive of [diakoneO] from [diakonos] [dia] and [konis], dust), to
   raise a dust in a hurry, to serve, to minister either at table (Joh
   12:20), or other service (Joh 12:25f.), to serve as deacon (1Ti 3:10,
   13). "Tables" here hardly means money-tables as in Joh 2:15, but rather
   the tables used in the common daily distribution of the food (possibly
   including the love-feasts, Ac 2:43-47). This word is the same root as
   [diakonia] (ministration) in verse 1 and [diakonos] (deacon) in Php
   1:1; 1Ti 3:8-13. It is more frequently used in the N.T. of ministers
   (preachers) than of deacons, but it is quite possible, even probable,
   that the office of deacon as separate from bishop or elder grew out of
   this incident in Ac 6:1-7. Furneaux is clear that these "seven" are not
   to be identified with the later "deacons" but why he does not make
   clear.

   6:3 Of good report [marturoumenous]. Present passive participle of
   [martureO], to bear witness to. Men with a good reputation as well as
   with spiritual gifts (the Holy Spirit and wisdom). We may appoint
   [katastesomen]. Future active indicative of [kathistemi], we shall
   appoint. The action of the apostles follows the choice by the church,
   but it is promised as a certainty, not as a possibility. The Textus
   Receptus has a first aorist active subjunctive here [katastesOmen].

   6:4 But we [hemeis de]. In contrast to the work given the seven. The
   ministry of the word [tei diakoniai tou logou]. The same word
   [diakoniai] employed in verse 1, but here about preaching as the
   special ministry with which the apostles were concerned. For "continue
   steadfastly" [proskarteresomen] see on 2:42.

   6:5 Pleased [eresen]. Aorist active indicative of [areskO] like Latin
   placuit when a vote was taken. The use of [enOpion] before "the whole
   multitude" is like the LXX. They chose [exelexanto]. First aorist
   middle indicative of [eklegO], to pick out for oneself. Each one of the
   seven has a Greek name and was undoubtedly a Hellenist, not an Aramaean
   Jew. Consummate wisdom is here displayed for the murmuring had come
   from the Hellenists, seven of whom were chosen to take proper care of
   the widows of Hellenists. This trouble was settled to stay settled so
   far as we know. Nothing is here told of any of the seven except Stephen
   who is "a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit" and Nicolas "a
   proselyte of Antioch" (who was not then born a Jew, but had come to the
   Jews from the Greek world).

   6:6 They laid their hands on them [epethekan autois tas cheiras]. First
   aorist active indicative of [epitithemi]. Probably by the apostles who
   ratified the choice (verse 3). The laying on of hands "was a symbol of
   the impartation of the gifts and graces which they needed to qualify
   them for the office. It was of the nature of a prayer that God would
   bestow the necessary gifts, rather than a pledge that they were
   actually conferred" (Hackett).

   6:7 Increased [euxanen]. Imperfect active, kept on growing all the more
   because the apostles were now relieved from the daily ministration of
   the food. Multiplied [eplethuneto]. Imperfect passive. The two
   imperfects kept pace with each other. Of the priests [tOn hierOn]. Who
   were usually Sadducees. It was a sad day for Annas and Caiaphas and all
   the sect of the Sadducees (5:17). Were obedient to [hupekouon].
   Imperfect active of [hupakouO], repetition, one after another. The
   faith [tei pistei]. Here meaning the gospel, the faith system as in Ro
   1:5; Ga 1:23; Jude 1:3, etc. Here the word means more than individual
   trust in Christ.

   6:8 Wrought [epoiei]. Imperfect active, repeatedly wrought. Evidently a
   man like Stephen would not confine his "ministry" to "serving tables."
   He was called in verse 5 "full of faith and the Holy Spirit." Here he
   is termed "full of grace (so the best MSS., not faith) and power." The
   four words give a picture of remarkable attractiveness. The grace of
   God gave him the power and so "he kept on doing great wonders and signs
   among the people." He was a sudden whirlwind of power in the very realm
   of Peter and John and the rest.

   6:9 The synagogue of the Libertines [ek tes sunagOges tes legomenes
   LibertinOn]. The Libertines (Latin libertinus, a freedman or the son of
   a freedman) were Jews, once slaves of Rome (perhaps descendants of the
   Jews taken to Rome as captives by Pompey), now set free and settled in
   Jerusalem and numerous enough to have a synagogue of their own.
   Schuerer calls a Talmudic myth the statement that there were 480
   synagogues in Jerusalem. There were many, no doubt, but how many no one
   knows. These places of worship and study were in all the cities of the
   later times where there were Jews enough to maintain one. Apparently
   Luke here speaks of five such synagogues in Jerusalem (that of the
   Libertines, of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, of Cilicia, and of
   Asia). There probably were enough Hellenists in Jerusalem to have five
   such synagogues. But the language of Luke is not clear on this point.
   He may make only two groups instead of five since he uses the article
   [tOn] twice (once before [LibertinOn kai KurenaiOn kai AlexandreOn],
   again before [apo Kilikias kai Asias]. He also changes from the
   genitive plural to [apo] before Cilicia and Asia. But, leaving the
   number of the synagogues unsettled whether five or two, it is certain
   that in each one where Stephen appeared as a Hellenist preaching Jesus
   as the Messiah he met opposition. Certain of them "arose" [anestesan]
   "stood up" after they had stood all that they could from Stephen,
   "disputing with Stephen" [sunzetountes tOi StephanOi]. Present active
   participle of [sunzeteO], to question together as the two on the way to
   Emmaus did (Lu 24:15). Such interruptions were common with Jews. They
   give a skilled speaker great opportunity for reply if he is quick in
   repartee. Evidently Stephen was fully equipped for the emergency. One
   of their synagogues had men from Cilicia in it, making it practically
   certain that young Saul of Tarsus, the brilliant student of Gamaliel,
   was present and tried his wits with Stephen. His ignominious defeat may
   be one explanation of his zest in the stoning of Stephen (Ac 8:1).

   6:10 They were not able to withstand [ouk ischuon antistenai].
   Imperfect active of [ischuO], to have strength, and ingressive second
   aorist active (intransitive) infinitive of [anthistemi]. They continued
   unable (without strength enough) to take a stand against. Stephen
   knocked them down, Saul included, as fast as they got up. Stephen was
   like a battery charged and in action. The wisdom and spirit [tei
   sophiai kai pneumati]. Dative case. They stood up against Stephen's
   wisdom and the Holy Spirit "by whom he spoke" [hOi elalei].
   Instrumental case and the relative agrees with "Spirit." He kept on
   speaking so [elalei], imperfect active). It was a desperate situation.

   6:11 Then they suborned men [tote hupebalon andras]. Second aorist
   active indicative of [hupoballO], old verb, but here only in the N.T.,
   to put under like a carpet, to bring men under one's control by
   suggestion or by money. One recalls the plight of Caiaphas in the trial
   of Jesus when he sought false witnesses. Subornaverunt. They put these
   men forward in an underhand way for fraud. Blasphemous words against
   Moses and God [blasphema eis MOusen kai ton theon]. The punishment for
   blasphemy was stoning to death. See Mt 12:31 for discussion of the word
   [blasphemia, blasphemeO, blasphemos], all in the N.T. from [blaptO], to
   harm, and [pheme], speech, harmful speech, or [blax], stupid, and
   [pheme]. But the charge against Stephen was untrue. Please note that
   Moses is here placed before God and practically on a par with God in
   the matter of blasphemy. The purpose of this charge is to stir the
   prejudices of the people in the matter of Jewish rights and privileges.
   It is the Pharisees who are conducting this attack on Stephen while the
   Sadducees had led them against Peter and John. The position of Stephen
   is critical in the extreme for the Sadducees will not help him as
   Gamaliel did the apostles.

   6:12 They stirred up the people [sunekinesan ton laon]. They shook the
   people together like an earthquake. First aorist active indicative of
   [sunkineO], to throw into commotion. Old verb, but here only in the
   N.T. The elders and the scribes (Pharisees) are reached, but no word
   about the Sadducees. This is the first record of the hostility of the
   masses against the disciples (Vincent). Came upon him [epistantes].
   Second aorist (ingressive) active participle of [ephistemi]. Rushed at
   him. Seized [sunerpasan]. Effective aorist active of [sunarpazO] as if
   they caught him after pursuit.

   6:13 False witnesses [marturas pseudeis]. Just as Caiaphas did with
   Jesus. Ceaseth not [ou pauetai]. Wild charge just like a false witness
   that Stephen talks in the synagogues against the law and the holy
   temple.

   6:14 We have heard him say [akekoamen autou legontos]. The only direct
   testimony and evidently wrong. Curiously like the charge brought
   against Jesus before Caiaphas that he would destroy the temple and
   build it again in three days. Undoubtedly Stephen had said something
   about Christianity before as meant for others besides Jews. He had
   caught the spirit of Jesus about worship as shown to the woman at
   Sychar in Joh 4 that God is spirit and to be worshipped by men anywhere
   and everywhere without having to come to the temple in Jerusalem. It
   was inflammable material surely and it was easy to misrepresent and
   hard to clear up. This Jesus of Nazareth [Iesous ho NazOraios houtos].
   With contempt.

   6:15 As if the face of an angel [hOsei prosOpon aggelou]. Even his
   enemies saw that, wicked as they were. See Ex 34:30 for the face of
   Moses when he came down from Sinai (2Co 3:7). Page quotes Tennyson:
   "God's glory smote him on the face." Where were Peter and John at this
   crisis? Apparently Stephen stands alone before the Sanhedrin as Jesus
   did. But he was not alone for he saw Jesus standing at the right hand
   of God (Ac 7:56). There was little that Peter and John could have done
   if they had been present. Gamaliel did not interpose this time for the
   Pharisees were behind the charges against Stephen, false though they
   were as Gamaliel could have found out.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 7

   7:1 Are these things so? [ei tauta houtOs echei]. On this use of [ei]
   in a direct question see on 1:6. Literally "Do these things hold thus?"
   A formal question by the high priest like our "Do you plead guilty, or
   not guilty?" (Furneaux). The abrupt question of the high priest would
   serve to break the evident spell of the angelic look on Stephen's face.
   Two charges had been made against Stephen (1) speaking against the holy
   temple, (2) changing the customs which Moses had delivered. Stephen
   could not give a yes or no answer to these two charges. There was an
   element of truth in each of them and a large amount of error all mixed
   together. So he undertakes to explain his real position by the
   historical method, that is to say, by a rapid survey of God's dealing
   with the people of Israel and the Gentiles. It is the same method
   adopted by Paul in Pisidian Antioch (Ac 13:16ff.) after he had become
   the successor of Stephen in his interpretation of the universal mission
   of Christianity. If one is disposed to say that Luke made up this
   speech to suit Stephen's predicament, he has to explain how the style
   is less Lukan than the narrative portions of Acts with knowledge of
   Jewish traditions that a Greek would not be likely to know. Precisely
   how Luke obtained the data for the speech we do not know, but Saul
   heard it and Philip, one of the seven, almost certainly. Both could
   have given Luke help about it. It is even possible that some one took
   notes of this important address. We are to remember also that the
   speech was interrupted at the end and may not include all that Stephen
   meant to say. But enough is given to give us a good idea of how Stephen
   met the first charge "by showing that the worship of God is not
   confined to Jerusalem or the Jewish temple" (Page). Then he answers the
   second charge by proving that God had many dealings with their fathers
   before Moses came and that Moses foretold the coming of the Messiah who
   is now known to be Jesus. It is at this point (verse 51) that Stephen
   becomes passionate and so powerful that the wolves in the Sanhedrin
   lose all self-control. It is a great and masterful exposition of the
   worldwide mission of the gospel of Christ in full harmony with the
   Great Commission of Christ. The apostles had been so busy answering the
   Sadducees concerning the Resurrection of Christ and maintaining their
   freedom to teach and preach that they had not pushed the world-wide
   propaganda of the gospel as Jesus had commanded after they had received
   the Promise of the Father. But Stephen had proclaimed the same message
   of Christ and was now facing the same fate. Peter's mind had been
   enlightened by the Holy Spirit so that he could rightly interpret Joel
   and David in the light of Pentecost. "So Stephen read the history of
   the Old Testament with new eyes in the light of the life and death of
   Jesus" (Furneaux).

   7:2 Brethren and fathers [andres adelphoi kai pateres]. The spectators
   (brethren) and members of the Sanhedrin (fathers) as Paul in Ac 22:1.
   Hearken [akousate]. First aorist (ingressive) active imperative, Give
   me your attention now. The God of glory [Ho theos tes doxes]. The God
   characterized by glory (genitive case, genus or kind) as seen in the
   Shekinah, the visible radiance of God. Jesus is also called "the Glory"
   = the Shekinah in Jas 2:1. Cf. Ex 25:22; 40:34; Le 9:6; Heb 9:5. By
   these words Stephen refutes the charge of blasphemy against God in Ac
   6:11. Appeared [Ophthe]. First aorist passive indicative of [horaO].
   See on Lu 23:43. Before there was temple or tabernacle and away over in
   Mesopotamia (Ur of the Chaldees, Ge 11:31), even before [prin e] with
   the infinitive) he dwelt in Haran [Charran], or Carrae not far from
   Edessa, where Crassus met death after his defeat by the Parthians B.C.
   53).

   7:3 Which I shall shew thee [hen an soi deixO]. Indefinite relative
   clause with [an] and the aorist active subjunctive (same form in first
   person singular as the future active indicative). Abraham followed on
   as God led him.

   7:4 When his father was dead [meta to apothanein auton]. [Meta] with
   the accusative of the articular infinitive and the accusative of
   general reference [auton], regular Greek idiom. In Ge 11:32 it is
   stated that Terah died at Haran at the age of 205. There are various
   explanations of the discrepancy, but no one that seems certain. It is
   possible (Hackett, Felten) that Abraham is mentioned first in Ge 11:26
   because he became the most prominent and was really younger than Haran
   his brother who died before the first migration who was really sixty
   years older than Abraham. According to this view Terah was 130 years
   old at the birth of Abraham, leaving Abraham 75 at the death of Terah
   (205). Wherein ye now dwell [eis hen humeis nun katoikeite]. Note [eis]
   in the sense of [en] as often. Note also emphatic use of [humeis] (ye)
   and now [nun].

   7:5 Not so much as to set his foot on [oude bema podos]. From De 2:5.
   Old word from [bainO], to go, to step. "Stepping of a foot," only
   instance of this original meaning in the N.T. From this it comes to
   mean a platform reached by steps, official seat of a judge (Mt 27:19).
   The field purchased by Abraham (Ge 23:9-17) was not a gift from God.
   Promised [epeggeilato]. First aorist middle indicative of [epaggellO],
   common verb. See Ge 12:7; 17:8; 48:4 for this promise. So God appeared
   again to Abraham in a strange land. In possession [eis kataschesin].
   Late word, in LXX, and in N.T. only here and verse 45. From [katechO],
   to hold back, then to hold fast (or down), to possess. It was fulfilled
   in the descendants of Abraham. When as yet he had no child [ouk ontos
   autOi teknou]. Genitive absolute with negative [ouk] rather than [me]
   to emphasize actual absence of a child. He had only the promise of God
   about the land and the child.

   7:6 On this wise [houtOs]. A free quotation from Ge 15:13. Should
   sojourn [estai paroikon]. Shall be a sojourner, [Paroikos] [para],
   beside, [oikos], home), one dwelling near one's home, but not of it, so
   a stranger, foreigner, old word, often in LXX, temporary residence
   without full rights of citizenship (7:29; 13:17), and descriptive of
   Christians (Eph 2:19; 1Pe 1:17; 2:11). In a strange land [en gei
   allotriai]. In a land not one's own, that belongs to another, alien as
   in Mt 17:25f., which see. Four hundred years [ete tetrakosia].
   Accusative of duration of time. As in Ge 15:13, but a round number as
   in Ex 12:40 the time is 430 years. But in Ga 3:17 Paul, following the
   LXX in Ex 12:40, takes the 430 years to cover the period in Canaan and
   the stay in Egypt, cutting the sojourn in Egypt to about half. Josephus
   gives it both ways. Hackett suggests two solutions, one that there were
   two ways of reckoning the period among the Jews with no way of settling
   it, the other that by the 430 years in Egypt the writers meant to
   include Canaan also as merely the preliminary to the period in Egypt.

   7:7 Will I judge [krinO egO]. Future (accent on [O] active indicative
   of [krinO] and [egO] (I) expressed is emphatic. In this place [en tOi
   topOi toutOi]. Quoted from Ex 3:12 and referring to Sinai or Horeb, but
   Stephen applies it to the Promised Land.

   7:8 The covenant of circumcision [diatheken peritomes]. A covenant
   marked by (genitive) circumcision (no article) of which circumcision is
   the sign (Ro 4:11) as set forth in Ge 17:9-14. In the ancient Greek
   [diatheke] was usually will (Latin, testamentum) and [suntheke] was
   used for covenant [sun], together, rather than [dia], between). But the
   LXX and the N.T. use [diatheke] for covenant (will in Heb 9:15f.) as
   Lightfoot on Ga 3:16 says: "The LXX translation and New Testament
   writers probably preferred [diatheke] as better expressing the free
   grace of God than [suntheke]." And so [kai houtOs]. After the covenant
   was made and as a sign and seal of it.

   7:9 Moved with jealousy [zelOsantes]. First aorist active participle of
   [zeloO], old verb from [zelos] (Ac 5:17), to burn or boil with zeal,
   and then with envy as here (17:5, etc.) and Ge 37:11.

   7:10 Delivered him out [exeilato auton ek]. First aorist middle
   indicative of [exaireO], old verb to take out, snatch out. Note
   repetition of [ek]. Pharaoh King of Egypt [PharaO basileOs Aiguptou].
   Pharaoh is not a name, but a title, the Egyptian peraa meaning great
   house.

   7:11 Found no sustenance [ouch heuriskon chortasmata]. Imperfect
   active, kept on not finding. Chortasmata is from chortazO, originally
   to feed with grass [chortos] or herbs. Old word, but only here in the
   N.T. and includes food for both men and animals. In Ge 24:25, 32 it is
   fodder for the cattle, a first necessity for owners of herds of cattle.

   7:12 That there was corn [onta sitia]. Participle (present active of
   [eimi] in indirect discourse, after [akousas], "heard of corn being in
   Egypt." [Sitia] is diminutive of [sitos] and means grain (wheat,
   barley, not our maize or Indian corn), old word also for provisions,
   victuals, here only in the N.T. The first time [prOton]. While Jacob
   himself remained in Canaan before he went down to Egypt and died there
   (verse 15f.).

   7:13 At the second time [en tOi deuterOi]. This expression only here in
   the N.T. This second visit is recorded in Ge 45:1ff. Became manifest
   [phaneron egeneto]. In Ge 41:12 the fact that Joseph was a Hebrew had
   been incidentally mentioned to Pharaoh, but now it was made clear to
   him.

   7:14 Three-score and fifteen souls [en psuchais hebdomekonta pente].
   Stephen follows the LXX which counts some grandchildren of Joseph and
   so makes it 75 whereas Ge 46:26 has 66 and then the next verse makes it
   70 including Jacob and Joseph with his two sons. The use of [en] means
   "consisting in."

   7:16 They were carried over unto Shechem [metetethesan eis Suchem].
   First aorist passive of [metatithemi], only here in the N.T. in this
   sense of changing places. Jacob was buried in the cave of Machpelah (Ge
   50:13). The O.T. does not say where the sons of Jacob were buried save
   that Joseph was buried in Shechem (Jos 24:32). Possibly only "our
   fathers" without Jacob is the subject of "were carried." Which Abraham
   bought [hOi Onesato Abraam]. Hackett is sure that our present text is
   wrong. Hort notes some sixty "primitive errors" in the critical text of
   the N.T. It is possible that this is also one. If "Jacob" is
   substituted for "Abraham," the matter is cleared up. "It is quite as
   likely, judging a priori, that the word producing the error escaped
   from some early copyist as that so glaring an error was committed by
   Stephen" (Hackett). At any rate Abraham bought a burying-place, the
   cave of Machpelah, from Ephron the Hittite at Hebron (Ge 23:16), while
   Jacob bought a field from the sons of Hamor at Shechem (Ge 33:19; Jos
   24:32). Abraham had built an altar at Shechem when he entered Canaan
   (Ge 12:6f.). It is possible, of course, that Abraham also bought the
   ground on which the altar stood. In Shechem [en Suchem]. This is the
   reading of Aleph B C instead of the Textus Receptus [tou Suchem] which
   makes it "Hamar the father of Sichem." "In Shechem" is the true
   reading.

   7:17 Drew nigh [eggizen]. Imperfect active, was drawing nigh.

   7:18 Another king [basileus heteros]. A different kind of king also,
   probably a king of the new dynasty after the shepherd kings had been
   expelled from Egypt. Who knew not Joseph [hos ouk eidei ton IOseph].
   Second past perfect of [oida] used like an imperfect. Joseph's history
   and services meant nothing to the new king. "The previous dynasty had
   been that of the Hyksos: the new king was Ahmes who drove out the
   Hyksos" (Knobel).

   7:19 Dealt subtilly [katasophisamenos]. First aorist middle participle
   of [katasophizomai], late compound [kata] and [sophizO], old verb, to
   make wise, to become wise, then to play the sophist), perfective use of
   [kata]. In the LXX, but here only in the N.T. To use fraud, craft,
   deceit. That they should cast out their babes [tou poiein ta brephe
   ektheta]. [Tou poiein] (genitive of the articular present infinitive)
   can be either design or result. The Revised Version here takes it as
   purpose while the Authorized as result. In either case Pharaoh required
   the Israelites to expose their children to death, a possible practice
   done voluntarily in heathen China and by heathen in so-called Christian
   lands. But the Israelites fought against such an iniquity. The word
   [ektheta] (exposed, cast out) is a verbal adjective from [ektithemi].
   It is an old word, but here only in the N.T. and not in the LXX. To the
   end they might not live [eis to me zOogoneisthai]. Purpose with [eis]
   and the articular infinitive (present middle). This compound verb is
   from [zOogonos] (from [zOos], alive, and [genO], to bear) and is used
   by late writers and the LXX. It is three times in the N.T. (here, Lu
   17:33; 1Ti 6:13) in the sense to preserve alive.

   7:20 Exceeding fair [asteios tOi theOi]. Ethical dative, fair to God
   (as God looked at him). [Asteios] is from [astu], city, and so means
   "of the city," with city manners and polish. Old word, only twice in
   the N.T. (here and Heb 11:23) and both times about Moses and taken from
   Ex 2:2. He was nourished [anetraphe]. Second aorist passive indicative
   of [anatrephO]. He was brought up at home for three months in defiance
   of the new Pharaoh.

   7:21 When he was cast out [ektethentos autou]. Genitive absolute with
   first aorist passive participle of [ektithemi]. Took up [aneilato].
   Second aorist middle indicative (with first aorist vowel [a] instead of
   [e] as often in the Koine) of [anaireO], common in the N.T. in the
   sense of take up and make away with, to kill as in verse 28, but here
   only in the N.T. in the original sense of taking up from the ground and
   with the middle voice (for oneself). Quoted here from Ex 2:5. The word
   was used of old for picking up exposed children as here. Vincent quotes
   Aristophanes (Clouds, 531): "I exposed (the child), and some other
   women, having taken it, adopted [aneileto] it." Vulgate has sustulit.
   "Adopted" is the idea here. "After the birth of a child the father took
   it up to his bosom, if he meant to rear it; otherwise it was doomed to
   perish" (Hackett). Nourished him for her own son [anethrepsato auton
   heautei eis huion]. Literally, "she nursed him up for herself [heautei]
   besides middle voice) as a son." This use of [eis] = as occurs in the
   old Greek, but is very common in the LXX as a translation of the Hebrew
   le. The tradition is that she designed Moses for the throne as the
   Pharaoh had no son (Josephus, Ant. ii. 9, 7).

   7:22 Was instructed [epaideuthe]. First aorist passive indicative of
   [paideuO], to train a child [pais], the usual idea in ancient Greek as
   here. The notion of chastisement (Heb 12:6) is also in the old Greek
   and especially in the LXX and the N.T. Here with instrumental case
   [pasei sophiai] or the locative. The accusative would usually be
   retained after this verb. The priestly caste in Egypt was noted for
   their knowledge of science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics. This
   reputation was proverbial (1Ki 4:30). Modern discoveries have thrown
   much light on the ancient civilization of Egypt. Moses, like Paul, was
   a man of the schools. Mighty in his words and works [dunatos en logois
   kai ergois autou]. The same phrase used of Jesus in Lu 24:19. The
   adjective [dunatos] is employed of Apollos as an interpreter of the
   Scriptures (Ac 18:24). Moses did not have the rhetorical skill or
   eloquence of Aaron (Ex 4:10), but his words like his deeds carried
   weight and power.

   7:23 When he was well-nigh forty years old [HOs eplerouto autOi
   tessarakontaetes chronos]. A rather awkward Greek idiom for the
   English: "When a forty year old time (same idiom in Ac 13:18 and only
   twice in the N.T.) was being fulfilled [eplerouto], imperfect passive)
   for him (dative case)." The life of Moses is divided into three periods
   of forty years each (in Egypt 40 years, in Midian 40, governed Israel
   40, 120 when he died, De 34:7). It came into his heart [anebe epi ten
   kardian autou]. Second aorist active indicative of [anabainO], common
   verb. Came up as if from the lower deeps of his nature. This Hebrew
   image occurs in Jer 3:16; Isa 65:17; 1Co 2:9. To visit
   [episkepsasthai]. First aorist middle infinitive of [episkeptomai], old
   verb to go to see for oneself, with his own eyes, to help if possible.
   Used of God visiting his people (Lu 7:16). Our "visit" is from Latin
   video, to see, visito, to go to see. During the Welsh mining troubles
   the Prince of Wales made a sympathetic visit to see for himself the
   actual condition of the coal miners. Moses desired to know first hand
   how his kinsmen were faring.

   7:24 Suffer wrong [adikoumenon]. Present passive participle of
   [adikeo]. By blows (Ex 2:11). Avenged [epoiesen ekdikesin]. First
   aorist active indicative of [poieO]. This idiom occurs in Lu 18:7 with
   [ekdikesin] (this from [ekdikeO] and that from [ekdikos] without right
   or law [dike] and then exacting law of right out of [ek] one, exacting
   vengeance). Him that was oppressed [tOi kataponoumenOi]. Present
   passive articular participle in the dative case of [kataponeo], to tire
   down with toil, to treat roughly, common in late Greek, in the N.T.
   only here and 2Pe 2:7 (sore distressed). The man was on the point of
   being overcome. Smiting [pataxas]. First aorist active participle of
   [patassO], in the old Greek the beat of the heart, only in the LXX and
   N.T. to smite a deadly blow as here like [plessO].

   7:25 He supposed [enomizen]. Imperfect active of [nomizO]. He was
   supposing, Stephen explains, when he smote the Egyptian. That his
   brethren understood [sunienai tous adelphous]. Present active
   infinitive of [suniemi], to send (put) together, to grasp, to
   comprehend, in indirect discourse with the accusative of general
   reference. By his hand was giving them deliverance [dia cheiros autou
   didOsin soterian autois]. Picturesque use of "hand" as in 2:23, present
   active indicative of [didOmi] retained in indirect discourse after
   imperfect [enomizen]. But they understood not [hoi de ou sunekan]. Page
   notes "the rhetorical power of these words" from Stephen. [Sunekan]
   (first aorist indicative, [k] aorist) refers to [sunienai] just before.

   7:26 The day following [tei epiousei hemerai]. Locative case, "on the
   following day" (from [epeimi], to come upon, to approach, present
   active participle [epiOn -ousa, -on]. Common phrase in old Greek both
   with [hemera] (day) as here and without as 16:11. Only in Acts in the
   N.T. Appeared [Ophthe]. First aorist passive indicative of [horaO] not
   with idea that only a vision but rather that it was sudden or
   unexpected. As they strove [machomenois]. Present middle participle of
   [machomai], actually fighting. Would have set them at one again
   [sunellassen autous eis eirenen]. Better, he tried to reconcile them
   (or change them into peace). It is the conative imperfect active as in
   Mt 3:14 of [sunallassO], only here in the N.T. though common in the old
   Greek. Vulgate has reconciliabat. The usual word in the N.T. for
   reconcile is [katallassO]. Do ye wrong one to another [adikeite
   allelous]. The same word used in verse 24 of the wrong done one of the
   Hebrews by the Egyptian, but here both are "brethren."

   7:27 Thrust him away [apOsato auton]. First aorist middle indicative
   (Koine for Attic [apeOsato] of [apOtheO], to push away from oneself in
   middle voice as here, common in old Greek. Again in verse 39; 13:46; Ro
   11:1; 1Ti 1:19. It is always the man who is doing the wrong who is hard
   to reconcile.

   7:28 Wouldest thou kill me? [me anelein me su theleis]. Expecting the
   answer no, but a thrust direct at Moses, Do you wish to kill me (note
   [me su] right together, me thou). See Ex 2:14 quoted by Stephen.

   7:29 Sojourner [paroikos]. Temporary dweller (cf. Abraham in verse 6)
   in Midian though for forty years.

   7:30 Sentence begins with genitive absolute again. In a flame of fire
   in a bush [en phlogi puros batou]. Horeb in Ex 3:1; but Sinai and Horeb
   were "probably peaks of one mountain range" (Page), Horeb "the mountain
   of the dried-up ground," Sinai "the mountain of the thorns." Literally,
   "in the flame of fire of a bush" (two genitives, [puros] and [batou]
   dependent on [phlogi], flame). Descriptive genitives as in 9:15; 2Th
   1:8. [Batos] (bush) is the wild acacia (mimosa nilotica). In Ex 3:20 it
   is Jehovah who speaks. Hence "angel" here with Stephen is understood to
   be the Angel of the Presence, the Eternal Logos of the Father, the
   Angel of Jehovah.

   7:31 The sight [to horama]. Used of visions in the N.T. as in Mt 17:9.
   As he drew near [proserchomenou autou]. Genitive absolute with present
   middle participle of [proserchomai]. A voice of the Lord [phOne
   kuriou]. Here the angel of Jehovah of verse 30 is termed Jehovah
   himself. Jesus makes powerful use of these words in his reply to the
   Sadducees in defence of the doctrine of the resurrection and the future
   life (Mr 12:26; Mt 22:32; Lu 20:37f.) that God here describes himself
   as the God of the living. Trembled [entromos genomenos]. Literally,
   becoming tremulous or terrified. The adjective [entromos] [en, tromos]
   from [tremO], to tremble, to quake) occurs in Plutarch and the LXX. In
   the N.T. only here and Ac 16:29. Durst not [ouk etolma]. Imperfect
   active, was not daring, negative conative imperfect.

   7:33 Holy ground [ge hagia]. The priests were barefooted when they
   ministered in the temple. Moslems enter their mosques barefooted today.
   Cf. Jos 5:15. Sandal [hupodema], bound under) is here "a distributive
   singular" (Hackett). Even the ground near the bush was "holy," a fine
   example for Stephen's argument.

   7:34 I have surely seen [idOn eidon]. Imitation of the Hebrew
   infinitive absolute, (Ex 3:7) "Seeing I saw" (cf. Heb 6:14). The
   affliction [ten kakOsin]. From [kakoO], to treat evilly (from [kakos],
   evil). Old word, here only in the N.T. and from Ex 3:7. Groaning
   [stenagmou]. Old word from [stenazO], to sigh, to groan. In the N.T.
   only here and Ro 8:26. Root [sten] in our word stentorian. I am come
   down [kateben]. Second aorist active indicative of [katabainO], I came
   down. To deliver [exelesthai]. Second aorist middle infinitive of
   [exaireO], to take out for myself. I will send [aposteilO]. First
   aorist active subjunctive (hortatory of [apostellO], "Let me send").

   7:35 This Moses [Touton ton MOusen]. Rhetorical repetition follows this
   description of Moses (five times, anaphora, besides the use here, six
   cases of [houtos] here about Moses: verse 35 twice, 36, 37, 38, 40).
   Clearly Stephen means to draw a parallel between Moses and Jesus. They
   in Egypt denied [ernesanto] Moses as now you the Jews denied
   [ernesasthe], 3:13) Jesus. Those in Egypt scouted Moses as "ruler and
   judge" (verses 27, 35, [archonta kai dikasten] and God "hath sent"
   [apestalken], perfect active indicative, state of completion) Moses
   "both a ruler and a deliverer" [archonta kai lutrOten] as Jesus was to
   be (Lu 1:68; 2:38; Heb 9:12; Tit 2:14). "Ransomer" or "Redeemer"
   [lutrOtes] is not found elsewhere, [lutron] (ransom), [lutroO], to
   ransom, and [lutrOsis], ransoming or redemption, are found often. In Ac
   5:31 Christ is termed "Prince and Saviour." With the hand [sun cheiri].
   So the correct text. The Pharisees had accused Stephen of blaspheming
   "against Moses and God" (6:11). Stephen here answers that slander by
   showing how Moses led the people out of Egypt in co-operation [sun]
   with the hand of the Angel of Jehovah.

   7:37 Like unto me [hOs eme]. This same passage Peter quoted to the
   crowd in Solomon's Porch (Ac 3:22). Stephen undoubtedly means to argue
   that Moses was predicting the Messiah as a prophet like himself who is
   no other than Jesus so that these Pharisees are in reality opposing
   Moses. It was a neat turn.

   7:38 In the church in the wilderness [en tei ekklesiai en tei eremOi].
   Better rendered "congregation" here as in Heb 2:12 (Ps 22:22), the
   people of Israel gathered at Mt. Sinai, the whole nation. Moses is here
   represented as receiving the law from an angel as in Heb 2:2; Ga 3:19
   (De 33:2, LXX) and so was a mediator [mesites] or middle man between
   the angel and the people whereas Jesus is the Mediator of a better
   covenant (Heb 8:6). But Exodus does not speak of an angel. Living
   oracles [logia zOnta]. A [logion] is a little word (diminutive of
   [logos]. Common in the old Greek, LXX, Philo, in ecclesiastical writers
   for sayings of Christ, Papias (for instance) saying that Matthew wrote
   in Hebrew (Aramaic) "Logia of Jesus." Oxyrhynchus papyri fragments
   called "Logia of Jesus" are of much interest though only fragments. The
   Greeks used it of the "oracles" or brief sayings from Delphi. In the
   N.T. the word occurs only four times (Ac 7:38; Ro 3:2; Heb 5:12; 1Pe
   4:11). Here the participle [zOnta], living, is the same used by Peter
   (1Pe 2:4f.), stone [lithos] of Christ and Christians. The words from
   God to Moses are still "living" today. In 1Pe 4:11 the word is applied
   to one who speaks [logia theou] (oracles of God). In Ro 3:2 Paul refers
   to the substance of the law and of prophecy. In Heb 5:12 the writer
   means the substance of the Christian religious teaching.

   7:39 To whom [hOi]. That is Moses, this Moses. Would not be [ouk
   ethelesan genesthai]. Aorist active, negative aorist, were unwilling to
   become [genesthai] obedient. Thrust him from them [apOsanto]. Indirect
   middle of the very verb used of the man (verse 27) who "thrust" Moses
   away from him. Turned back [estraphesan]. Second aorist passive
   indicative of [strephO], to turn. They yearned after the fleshpots of
   Egypt and even the gods of Egypt. It is easy now to see why Stephen has
   patiently led his hearers through this story. He is getting ready for
   the home-thrust.

   7:40 Gods which shall go before us [theous hoi proporeusontai hemOn].
   Ex 32:1. As guides and protectors, perhaps with some allusion to the
   pillar of fire and of cloud that had gone before them (Ex 13:21). The
   future indicative here with [hoi] (relative) expresses purpose. Ye wot
   not [ouk oidamen]. We do not know. How quickly they had forgotten both
   God and Moses while Moses was absent in the mount with God. Become of
   him [egeneto autOi]. Happened to him. "This" [houtos] here is a
   contemptuous allusion to Moses by the people.

   7:41 They made a calf [emoschopoiesan]. First aorist active indicative
   of [moschopoieO], here only in the N.T. and unknown elsewhere. The LXX
   (Ex 32:3) has [epoiese moschon] from which phrase the word is evidently
   made. Aaron made the calf, but so did the people (Ex 32:35). The idol
   [tOi eidOlOi]. Stephen calls it by the right name. The people said it
   was their way of worshipping Jehovah! So the Egyptians worshipped the
   bull Apis at Memphis as the symbol of Osiris (the sun). They had
   another sacred bull Mnevis at Leontopolis. [EidOlon] (from [eidos],
   form or figure) is the image or likeness of anything. The heathen
   worship the god through the image or idol. Rejoiced [euphrainonto].
   Imperfect, middle, kept on rejoicing (Ex 32:6,18) or making merry.

   7:42 Gave them up [paredOken]. First aorist active indicative of
   [paradidOmi]. This same form occurs three times like clods on a coffin
   in a grave in Ro 1:24, 26, 28 where Paul speaks of God giving the
   heathen up to their lusts. To serve the host of heaven [latreuein tei
   stratiai tou ouranou]. The verb [latreuO] is used of the worship of God
   (Mt 4:10) as well as of idols as here (from [latron], hire, [latris],
   hireling, then to serve). But the worship of the host of heaven (De
   17:3; 2Ki 17:16; 21:3; 2Ch 33:3,5; Jer 8:2; 19:13) is Sabaism or
   worship of the host [stratia] of heaven (sun, moon, and stars) instead
   of the Lord of hosts. This star-worship greatly injured the Jews. In
   the book of the prophets [en biblOi tOn prophetOn]. That is the twelve
   minor prophets which the Jews counted as one book (cf. Ac 13:40). This
   quotation is from Am 5:25-27. The greater prophets were Isaiah,
   Jeremiah, Ezekiel. Slain beasts [sphagia]. Here only in the N.T. (from
   Am 5:25) [sphage], slaughter, [sphazO], to slay.

   7:43 The tabernacle of Moloch [ten skenen tou Moloch]. Or tent of
   Moloch which they took up after each halt instead of the tabernacle of
   Jehovah. Moloch was the god of the Amorites to whom children were
   offered as live sacrifices, an ox-headed image with arms outstretched
   in which children were placed and hollow underneath so that fire could
   burn underneath. The star of the god Rephan [to astron tou theou
   Rompha]. Spelled also Romphan and Remphan. Supposed to be Coptic for
   the star Saturn to which the Egyptians, Arabs, and Phoenicians gave
   worship. But some scholars take the Hebrew Kiyyoon to mean statues and
   not a proper name at all, "statues of your gods" carried in procession,
   making "figures" [tupous] with both "tabernacle" and "star" which they
   carried in procession. I will carry [metoikiO]. Attic future of
   [metoikisO] from [metoikizO]. Beyond Babylon [epekeina BabulOnos]. The
   Hebrew and the LXX have "beyond Damascus." An adverbial preposition
   [ep' ekeina] with [mere] understood) used in the old Greek and the LXX
   with the ablative case and meaning "beyond." Here only in the N.T. in
   quotation from Am 5:27.

   7:44 The tabernacle of the testimony [he skene tou marturiou]. Probably
   suggested by the mention of "the tabernacle of Moloch" (verse 43). See
   on Mt 17:4 for discussion of [skene] (from [skia], shadow, root [ska],
   to cover). This first sanctuary was not the temple, but the tent in the
   wilderness. "Stephen passes on from the conduct of the Israelites to
   his other argument that God is not necessarily worshipped in a
   particular spot" (Page). According to the figure [kata ton tupon].
   According to the type or pattern. [Tupos] is from [tuptO], to strike,
   to smite, and is the print of the blow (Joh 20:25), then the figure
   formed by a blow or impression like our type, a model or example.
   Quoted from Ex 25:40. Common word in the old Greek. That he had seen
   [hon heOrakei]. Past perfect active of [horaO], to see (double
   reduplication).

   7:45 Which [hen]. Agreeing with [skenen], not with [tupon]. In their
   turn [diadexamenoi]. First aorist middle participle of [diadechomai],
   to receive through another, to receive in sucession or in turn. Late
   Greek, only here in N.T. Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 115) argues from
   a second century B.C. papyrus that [diadochos] means rather deputy or
   court official than successor. With Joshua [meta Iesou]. With Jesus,
   the Greek form of Joshua (contracted from Jehoshua, Mt 1:21), as in Heb
   4:8. When they entered on the possession of the nations [en tei
   kataschesei tOn ethnOn]. Literally "in (or at the time of) the
   possession of the nations." See on 7:5 for the only other N.T. instance
   of [kataschesis]. Which [hOn]. The nations, genitive by attraction to
   case of [ethnOn]. Thrust out [exOsen]. First aorist active indicative
   of [exOtheO], to push out, common verb, here, only in N.T. save some
   MSS. in Ac 27:39.

   7:46 Asked [eitesato]. Aorist middle (indirect) indicative, asked for
   himself (as a favour to himself). Cf. 2Sa 7:2f. A habitation [skenOma].
   Like Ps 132:5, but it was a house that David proposed to build (2Sa
   7:2), not a tent [skene] which already existed. [SkenOma] here means a
   more permanent abode [oikon], house, in verse 47), though from the same
   root as [skene].

   7:48 Howbeit [all']. By contrast with what Solomon did and David
   planned. Note emphatic position of "not" [all' ouch], "But not does the
   Most High dwell." The presence of the Most High is not confined in any
   building, even one so splendid as Solomon's Temple as Solomon himself
   foresaw and acknowledged in his prayer (1Ki 8:27; 2Ch 6:18). In houses
   made with hands [en cheiropoietois]. No word here for "houses" or
   "temples" in correct text [naois] temples in Textus Receptus).
   Literally, "In things made with hands" [cheir], hand, [poietos], verbal
   adjective of [poieO]. It occurs in Mr 14:58 of the temple and of the
   sanctuary of Moab (Isa 16:12). It occurs also in Ac 7:24; Heb 9:11, 24;
   Eph 2:11. Common in the old Greek. The prophet [ho prophetes]. Isa
   66:1. Isaiah taught plainly that heaven is God's throne.

   7:49 What manner of house [Poion oikon]. What sort of a house? This
   interrogative is sometimes scornful as in 4:7; Lu 6:32ff. (Page). So
   Stephen shows by Isaiah that Solomon was right that the temple was not
   meant to "confine" God's presence and that Jesus had rightly shown that
   God is a spirit and can be worshipped anywhere by any individual of any
   race or land. It is a tremendous argument for the universality and
   spirituality of Christianity free from the shackles of Jewish racial
   and national limitations, but its very strength only angered the
   Sanhedrin to desperation.

   7:51 Stiffnecked [sklerotracheloi]. From [skleros] (hard) and
   [trachelos], neck, both old words, but this compound only in the LXX
   and here alone in the N.T. Critics assume that Stephen was interrupted
   at this point because of the sharp tone of the speech. That may be
   true, but the natural climax is sufficient explanation. Uncircumcised
   in heart [aperitmetoi kardiais]. Late adjective common in LXX and here
   only in the N.T. Verbal of [peritemnO], to cut around and [a]
   privative. Both of these epithets are applied to the Jews in the O.T.
   (Ex 32:9; 33:3,5; 34:9; Le 26:41; De 9:6; Jer 6:10). [Kardiais] is
   locative plural like [Osin] (ears), but some MSS. have genitive
   singular [kardias] (objective genitive). No epithet could have been
   more galling to these Pharisees than to be turned "uncircumcised in
   heart" (Ro 2:29). They had only the physical circumcision which was
   useless. Ye always [humeis aei]. Emphatic position of humeis and
   "always" looks backward over the history of their forefathers which
   Stephen had reviewed. Resist [antipiptete]. Old word to fall against,
   to rush against. Only here in the N.T., but used in the O.T. which is
   here quoted (Nu 27:14). Their fathers had made "external worship a
   substitute for spiritual obedience" (Furneaux). Stephen has shown how
   God had revealed himself gradually, the revelation sloping upward to
   Christ Jesus. "And as he saw his countrymen repeating the old
   mistake--clinging to the present and the material, while God was
   calling them to higher spiritual levels--and still, as ever, resisting
   the Holy Spirit, treating the Messiah as the patriarchs had treated
   Joseph, and the Hebrews Moses--the pity of it overwhelmed him, and his
   mingled grief and indignation broke out in words of fire, such as
   burned of old on the lips of the prophets" (Furneaux). Stephen, the
   accused, is now the accuser, and the situation becomes intolerable to
   the Sanhedrin.

   7:52 Which of the prophets [tina tOn prophetOn]. Jesus (Lu 11:47; Mt
   23:29-37) had charged them with this very thing. Cf. 2Ch 36:16. Which
   shewed before [prokataggeilantas]. The very prophets who foretold the
   coming of the Messiah their fathers killed. The coming [tes eleuseOs].
   Not in ancient Greek or LXX and only here in the N.T. (in a few late
   writers). Betrayers [prodotai]. Just like Judas Iscariot. He hurled
   this old biting word at them. In the N.T. only here and Lu 6:16; 2Ti
   3:4. It cut like a knife. It is blunter than Peter in Ac 3:13.
   Murderers [phoneis]. The climax with this sharp word used of Barabbas
   (3:14).

   7:53 Ye who [hoitines]. The very ones who, quippe qui, often in Acts
   when the persons are enlarged upon (8:15; 9:35; 10:41, 47). As it was
   ordained by angels [eis diatagas aggelOn]. About angels see on 7:38.
   [Diatage] (from [diatassO], to arrange, appoint) occurs in late Greek,
   LXX, inscriptions, papyri, Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, pp.
   89ff., and in N.T. only here and Ro 13:2. At (or as) the appointment of
   angels (cf. Mt 10:41; 12:41 for this use of [eis]. And kept it not [kai
   ouk ephulaxate]. Like a whipcracker these words cut to the quick. They
   gloried in possessing the law and openly violated it (Ro 2:23).

   7:54 When they heard [akouontes]. Present active participle of [akouO],
   while hearing. They were cut to the heart [dieprionto tais kardiais].
   See 5:33 where the same word and form (imperfect passive of [diapriO]
   is used of the effect of Peter's speech on the Sadducees. Here Stephen
   had sent a saw through the hearts of the Pharisees that rasped them to
   the bone. They gnashed on him with their teeth [ebruchon tous odontas
   ep' auton]. Imperfect (inchoative) active of [bruchO] (Attic [brukO],
   to bite with loud noise, to grind or gnash the teeth. Literally, They
   began to gnash their teeth at [ep'] him (just like a pack of hungry,
   snarling wolves). Stephen knew that it meant death for him.

   7:55 And Jesus standing [kai Iesoun hestOta]. Full of the Holy Spirit,
   gazing steadfastly into heaven, he saw God's glory and Jesus "standing"
   as if he had risen to cheer the brave Stephen. Elsewhere (save verse 56
   also) he is pictured as sitting at the right hand of God (the Session
   of Christ) as in Mt 26:64; Mr 16:19; Ac 2:34; Eph 1:20; Col 3:1; Heb
   1:3.

   7:56 Opened [dienoigmenous]. Perfect passive predicate participle of
   [dianoignumi] (cf. Mt 3:16; Lu 3:21). The son of man [ton huion tou
   anthrOpou]. Elsewhere in the N.T. in Christ's own words. Here Stephen
   may refer to the words of Jesus as preserved in Mt 26:64.

   7:57 Stopped their ears [suneschon ta Ota autOn]. Second aorist active
   of [sunechO], to hold together. They held their ears together with
   their hands and affected to believe Stephen guilty of blasphemy (cf. Mt
   26:65). Rushed upon him with one accord [hOrmesan homothumadon ep'
   auton]. Ingressive aorist active indicative of [hormaO], to rush
   impetuously as the hogs did down the cliff when the demons entered them
   (Lu 8:33). No vote was taken by the Sanhedrin. No scruple was raised
   about not having the right to put him to death (Joh 8:31). It may have
   taken place after Pilate's recall and before his successor came or
   Pilate, if there, just connived at such an incident that did not
   concern Rome. At any rate it was mob violence like modern lynching that
   took the law into the hands of the Sanhedrin without further
   formalities. Out of the city [ek tes poleOs]. To keep from defiling the
   place with blood. But they sought to kill Paul as soon as they got him
   out of the temple area (Ac 21:30f.). Stoned [elithoboloun]. Imperfect
   active indicative of [lithoboleO], began to stone, from [lithobolos]
   [lithos], stone, [ballO], to throw), late Greek verb, several times in
   the N.T. as Lu 13:34. Stoning was the Jewish punishment for blasphemy
   (Le 24:14-16). The witnesses [hoi martures]. The false testifiers
   against Stephen suborned by the Pharisees (Ac 6:11,13). These witnesses
   had the privilege of casting the first stones (De 13:10; 17:7) against
   the first witness for Christ with death (martyr in our modern sense of
   the word). At the feet of a young man named Saul [para tous podas
   neaniou kaloumenou Saulou]. Beside [para] the feet. Our first
   introduction to the man who became the greatest of all followers of
   Jesus Christ. Evidently he was not one of the "witnesses" against
   Stephen, for he was throwing no stones at him. But evidently he was
   already a leader in the group of Pharisees. We know from later hints
   from Saul (Paul) himself that he had been a pupil of Gamaliel (Ac
   22:3). Gamaliel, as the Pharisaic leader in the Sanhedrin, was probably
   on hand to hear the accusations against Stephen by the Pharisees. But,
   if so, he does not raise his voice against this mob violence. Saul does
   not seem to be aware that he is going contrary to the views of his
   master, though pupils often go further than their teachers.

   7:59 They stoned [elithoboloun]. Same verb and tense repeated, they
   kept on stoning, they kept it up as he was calling upon the Lord Jesus
   and making direct prayer to him as "Lord Jesus" [Kurie Iesou]. Receive
   my spirit [dexai to pneuma mou]. Aorist middle imperative, urgency,
   receive it now. Many have followed Stephen into death with these words
   upon their dying lips. See, 9:14, 21; 22:16.

   7:60 Kneeled down [theis ta gonata]. Second aorist active participle of
   [tithemi], placing the knees (on the ground). This idiom is not in the
   old Greek for kneeling, but Luke has it five times (Lu 22:41; Ac 7:60;
   9:40; 22:36; 21:5) and Mark once (15:19). Jesus was standing at the
   right hand of God and Stephen knelt before him in worship and called on
   him in prayer. Lay not this sin to their charge [me steseis autois
   tauten ten hamartian]. First aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive
   with [me], regular Greek idiom, Place not to them or against them
   (dative [autois] this sin. The very spirit of Jesus towards his enemies
   as he died upon the Cross (Lu 23:34). He fell asleep [ekoimethe]. First
   aorist passive indicative of [koimaO], to put to sleep. Old verb and
   the metaphor of sleep for death is common in all languages, but it is
   peculiarly appropriate here as Jesus used it of Lazarus. See also Ac
   13:36; 1Co 15:18, etc. Our word cemetery [koimeterion] is the sleeping
   place of the dead. Knowling calls [ekoimethe] here "a picture word of
   rest and calmness which stands in dramatic contrast to the rage and
   violence of the scene."
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 8

   8:1 Was consenting [en suneudokOn]. Periphrastic imperfect of
   [suneudokeO], a late double compound [sun, eu, dokeO] that well
   describes Saul's pleasure in the death [anairesis], taking off, only
   here in the N.T., though old word) of Stephen. For the verb see on Lu
   23:32. Paul himself will later confess that he felt so (Ac 22:20),
   coolly applauding the murder of Stephen, a heinous sin (Ro 1:32). It is
   a gruesome picture. Chapter 7 should have ended here. On that day [en
   ekeinei tei hemerai]. On that definite day, that same day as in 2:41. A
   great persecution [diOgmos megas]. It was at first persecution from the
   Sadducees, but this attack on Stephen was from the Pharisees so that
   both parties are now united in a general persecution that deserves the
   adjective "great." See on Mt 13:21 for the old word [diOgmos] from
   [diOkO], to chase, hunt, pursue, persecute. Were all scattered abroad
   [pantes diesparesan]. Second aorist passive indicative of [diaspeirO],
   to scatter like grain, to disperse, old word, in the N.T. only in Ac
   8:1, 4; 11:19. Except the apostles [plen tOn apostolOn]. Preposition
   [plen] (adverb from [pleon], more) with the ablative often in Luke. It
   remains a bit of a puzzle why the Pharisees spared the apostles. Was it
   due to the advice of Gamaliel in Ac 5:34-40? Or was it the courage of
   the apostles? Or was it a combination of both with the popularity of
   the apostles in addition?

   8:2 Devout [eulabeis]. Only four times in the N.T. (Lu 2:25; Ac 2:5;
   8:2; 22:12). Possibly some non-Christian Jews helped. The burial took
   place before the Christians were chiefly scattered. Buried
   [sunekomisan]. Aorist active indicative of [sunkomizO], old verb to
   bring together, to collect, to join with others in carrying, to bury
   (the whole funeral arrangements). Only here in the N.T. Lamentation
   [kopeton]. Late word from [koptomai], to beat the breast, in LXX,
   Plutarch, etc., only here in the N.T.

   8:3 Laid waste [elumaineto]. Imperfect middle of [lumainomai], old verb
   (from [lume], injury), to dishonour, defile, devastate, ruin. Only here
   in the N.T. Like the laying waste of a vineyard by a wild boar (Ps
   79:13). Picturesque description of the havoc carried on by Saul now the
   leader in the persecution. He is victor over Stephen now who had
   probably worsted him in debate in the Cilician synagogue in Jerusalem.
   Into every house [kata tous oikous]. But Luke terms it "the church"
   [ten ekklesian]. Plainly not just an "assembly," but an organized body
   that was still "the church" when scattered in their own homes, "an
   unassembled assembly" according to the etymology. Words do not remain
   by the etymology, but travel on with usage. Haling [surOn]. Literally,
   dragging forcibly (=hauling). Present active participle of [surO], old
   verb. Men and women [andras kai gunaikas]. A new feature of the
   persecution that includes the women. They met it bravely as through all
   the ages since (cf. 9:2; 22:4). This fact will be a bitter memory for
   Paul always. Committed [paredidou]. Imperfect active of [paradidOmi],
   old verb, kept on handing them over to prison.

   8:4 They therefore [hoi men oun]. Demonstrative [hoi] as often (1:6,
   etc.) though it will make sense as the article with the participle
   [diasparentes]. The general statement is made here by [men] and a
   particular instance [de] follows in verse 5. The inferential particle
   [oun] points back to verse 3, the persecution by young Saul and the
   Pharisees. Jesus had commanded the disciples not to depart from
   Jerusalem till they received the Promise of the Father (1:4), but they
   had remained long after that and were not carrying the gospel to the
   other peoples (1:8). Now they were pushed out by Saul and began as a
   result to carry out the Great Commission for world conquest, that is
   those "scattered abroad" [diasparentes], second aorist passive
   participle of [diaspeirO]. This verb means disperse, to sow in separate
   or scattered places [dia] and so to drive people hither and thither.
   Old and very common verb, especially in the LXX, but in the N.T. only
   in Ac 8:1, 4; 11:19. Went about [dielthon]. Constative second aorist
   active of [dierchomai], to go through (from place to place, [dia]. Old
   and common verb, frequent for missionary journeys in the Acts (5:40;
   8:40; 9:32; 11:19; 13:6). Preaching the word [euaggelizomenoi ton
   logon]. Evangelizing or gospelizing the word (the truth about Christ).
   In 11:19 Luke explains more fully the extent of the labours of these
   new preachers of the gospel. They were emergency preachers, not
   ordained clergymen, but men stirred to activity by the zeal of Saul
   against them. The blood of the martyrs (Stephen) was already becoming
   the seed of the church. "The violent dispersion of these earnest
   disciples resulted in a rapid diffusion of the gospel" (Alvah Hovey).

   8:5 Philip [Philippos]. The deacon (6:5) and evangelist (21:8), not the
   apostle of the same name (Mr 3:18). To the city of Samaria [eis ten
   polin tes Samarias]. Genitive of apposition. Samaria is the name of the
   city here. This is the first instance cited of the expansion noted in
   verse 4. Jesus had an early and fruitful ministry in Samaria (Joh 4),
   though the twelve were forbidden to go into a Samaritan city during the
   third tour of Galilee (Mt 10:5), a temporary prohibition withdrawn
   before Jesus ascended on high (Ac 1:8). Proclaimed [ekerussen].
   Imperfect active, began to preach and kept on at it. Note
   [euaggelizomenoi] in verse 4 of missionaries of good news (Page) while
   [ekerussen] here presents the preacher as a herald. He is also a
   teacher [didaskalos] like Jesus. Luke probably obtained valuable
   information from Philip and his daughters about these early days when
   in his home in Caesarea (Ac 21:8).

   8:6 Gave heed [proseichon]. Imperfect active as in verses 10, 11, there
   with dative of the person [autOi], here with the dative of the thing
   [tois legomenois]. There is an ellipse of [noun] (mind). They kept on
   giving heed or holding the mind on the things said by Philip,
   spell-bound, in a word. When they heard [en tOi akouein autous].
   Favourite Lukan idiom, [en] and the locative case of the articlar
   infinitive with the accusative of general reference "in the hearing as
   to them." Which he did [ha epoiei]. Imperfect active again, which he
   kept on doing from time to time. Philip wrought real miracles which
   upset the schemes of Simon Magus.

   8:7 For many [polloi gar]. So the correct text of the best MSS., but
   there is an anacoluthon as this nominative has no verb with it. It was
   "the unclean spirits" that "came out" [exerchonto], imperfect middle).
   The margin of the Revised Version has it "came forth," as if they came
   out of a house, a rather strained translation. The loud outcry is like
   the demons cast out by Jesus (Mr 3:11; Lu 4:41). Palsied
   [paralelumenoi], perfect passive participle). Luke's usual word,
   loosened at the side, with no power over the muscles. Furneaux notes
   that "the servant was reaping where the Master had sown. Samaria was
   the mission field white for the harvest (Joh 4:35)." The Samaritans who
   had been bewitched by Simon are now carried away by Philip.

   8:9 Simon [SimOn]. One of the common names (Josephus, Ant. XX. 7, 2)
   and a number of messianic pretenders had this name. A large number of
   traditions in the second and third centuries gathered round this man
   and Baur actually proposed that the Simon of the Clementine Homilies is
   really the apostle Paul though Paul triumphed over the powers of magic
   repeatedly (Ac 13:6-12; 19:11-19), "a perfect absurdity" (Spitta,
   Apostelgeschichte, p. 149). One of the legends is that this Simon Magus
   of Acts is the father of heresy and went to Rome and was worshipped as
   a god (so Justin Martyr). But a stone found in the Tiber A.D. 1574 has
   an inscription to Semoni Sanco Deo Fidio Sacrum which is (Page) clearly
   to Hercules, Sancus being a Sabine name for Hercules. This Simon in
   Samaria is simply one of the many magicians of the time before the
   later gnosticism had gained a foothold. "In his person Christianity was
   for the first time confronted with superstition and religious
   imposture, of which the ancient world was at this period full"
   (Furneaux). Which beforetime used sorcery [prouperchen mageuOn]. An
   ancient idiom (periphrastic), the present active participle [mageuOn]
   with the imperfect active verb from [prouparchO], the idiom only here
   and Lu 23:12 in the N.T. Literally "Simon was existing previously
   practising magic." This old verb [mageuO] is from [magos] (a [magus],
   seer, prophet, false prophet, sorcerer) and occurs here alone in the
   N.T. Amazed (existanOn). Present active participle of the verb
   [existanO], later form of [existemi], to throw out of position,
   displace, upset, astonish, chiefly in the Gospels in the N.T. Same
   construction as [mageuOn]. Some great one [tina megan]. Predicate
   accusative of general reference (infinitive in indirect discourse). It
   is amazing how gullible people are in the presence of a manifest
   impostor like Simon. The Magi were the priestly order in the Median and
   Persian empires and were supposed to have been founded by Zoroaster.
   The word [magoi] (magi) has a good sense in Mt 2:1, but here and in Ac
   13:6 it has the bad sense like our "magic."

   8:10 That power of God which is called Great [he Dunamis tou theou he
   kaloumene Megale]. Apparently here already the oriental doctrine of
   emanations or aeons so rampant in the second century. This "power" was
   considered a spark of God himself and Jerome (in Mt 24) quotes Simon
   (Page) as saying: Ego sum sermo Dei, ... ego omnipotens, ego omnia Dei.
   Simon claimed to impersonate God.

   8:11 Because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries
   [dia to hikanOi chronOi tais magiais exestakenai autous]. Causal use of
   [dia] with the accusative articular infinitive (perfect active Koine
   form and transitive, [exestakenai]. Same verb as in verse 9 participle
   [existanOn] and in verse 13 imperfect passive [existato] (cf. also 2:7
   already). [ChronOi] is associative instrumental and [magiais]
   instrumental case.

   8:12 They were baptized [ebaptizonto]. Imperfect passive (repetition,
   from time to time), while believed [episteusan] is constative aorist
   antecedent to the baptism. Note dative case of Philip with
   [episteusan]. Note the gospel of Philip "concerning the kingdom of God,
   and the name of Jesus Christ."

   8:13 And Simon also himself believed [Ho de SimOn kai autos
   episteusen]. Note the same verb in the aorist tense [episteusen]. What
   did he believe? Evidently that Jesus was this "power of God" not
   himself (Simon). He saw that the miracles wrought by Philip in the name
   of Christ were genuine while he knew that his own were frauds. He
   wanted this power that Philip had to add to his own pretensions. "He
   was probably half victim of self-delusion, half conscious impostor"
   (Furneaux). He was determined to get this new "power," but had no sense
   of personal need of Jesus as Saviour for his sins. So he submitted to
   baptism [baptistheis], first aorist passive participle of [baptizO],
   clear proof that baptism does not convey salvation. He continued with
   Philip [en proskarterOn tOi PhilippOi]. Periphrastic imperfect of the
   verb [proskartereO] (see on 2:46). He stuck to Philip (dative case) to
   find out the secret of his power. Beholding [theOrOn]. Watching the
   signs and miracles (powers, [dunameis] that threw his "power" in the
   shade) as they were wrought [ginomenas], present middle participle of
   [ginomai]. The more he watched the more the wonder grew [existato]. He
   had "amazed" (verse 9) the people by his tricks and he was himself more
   "amazed" than they by Philip's deeds.

   8:14 That Samaria had received [hoti dedektai he Samaria]. The district
   here, not the city as in verse 5. Perfect middle indicative of
   [dechomai] retained in indirect discourse. It was a major event for the
   apostles for now the gospel was going into Samaria as Jesus had
   predicted (1:8). Though the Samaritans were nominally Jews, they were
   not held so by the people. The sending of Peter and John was no
   reflection on Philip, but was an appropriate mission since "many
   Christian Jews would be scandalized by the admission of Samaritans"
   (Furneaux). If Peter and John sanctioned it, the situation would be
   improved. John had once wanted to call down fire from heaven on a
   Samaritan village (Lu 9:54).

   8:15 That they might receive [hopOs labOsin]. Second aorist active
   subjunctive of [lambanO], final clause with [hopOs]. Did they wish the
   Samaritan Pentecost to prove beyond a doubt that the Samaritans were
   really converted when they believed? They had been baptized on the
   assumption that the Holy Spirit had given them new hearts. The coming
   of the Holy Spirit with obvious signs (cf. 10:44-48) as in Jerusalem
   would make it plain.

   8:16 He was fallen [en epipeptOkos]. Periphrastic past perfect active
   of [epipiptO], old verb. The participle is neuter here because of the
   grammatical gender of [pneuma], but the translation should be "he"
   (natural gender), not "it." We should not use "it" for the Holy Spirit.
   Only they had been baptized [monon de babaptismenoi huperchon].
   Periphrastic past perfect passive of [baptizO] with [huparchO] (see
   verse 9 [prouperchon], instead of [esan]. Into the name [eis to onoma].
   Better, in the name (see on 2:38).

   8:17 Laid they their hands [epetithesan tas cheiras]. Imperfect active,
   repetition. The laying on of hands did not occur at the great Pentecost
   (2:4, 33) nor in 4:31; 10:44 nor is it mentioned in 1Co 12; 14. It is
   mentioned in Ac 6:7 about the deacons and in 13:3 when Barnabas and
   Saul left Antioch. And in Saul's case it was Ananias who laid his hands
   on him (9:17). Hence it cannot be concluded that the Holy Spirit was
   received only by the laying on of the hands of the apostles or by the
   hands of anyone. The so-called practice of "confirmation" appeals to
   this passage, but inconclusively. They received [elambanon]. Imperfect
   active, repetition as before and [pari passu] with the laying on of the
   hands.

   8:18 When Simon saw [IdOn de ho SimOn]. This participle (second aorist
   active of [horaO] shows plainly that those who received the gift of the
   Holy Spirit spoke with tongues. Simon now saw power transferred to
   others. Hence he was determined to get this new power. He offered them
   money [prosenegken chremata]. Second aorist active indicative of
   [prospherO]. He took Peter to be like himself, a mountebank performer
   who would sell his tricks for enough money. Trafficking in things
   sacred like ecclesiastical preferments in England is called "Simony"
   because of this offer of Simon.

   8:19 Me also [kamoi]. This is the whole point with this charlatan. He
   wants the power to pass on "this power." His notion of "The Holy
   Spirit" was on this low level. He regarded spiritual functions as a
   marketable commodity. Money "can buy diamonds, but not wisdom, or
   sympathy, or faith, or holiness" (Furneaux).

   8:20 Perish with thee [sun soi eie eis apOleian]. Literally, Be with
   thee for destruction. Optative for a future wish. The use of [eis] with
   the accusative in the predicate is especially common in the LXX. The
   wish reveals Peter's indignation at the base offer of Simon. Peter was
   no grafter to accept money for spiritual power. He spurned the
   temptation. The natural meaning of Peter's language is that Simon was
   on the road to destruction. It is a warning and almost a curse on him,
   though verse 22 shows that there was still room for repentance. To
   obtain [ktasthai]. To acquire. Usual meaning of the present tense
   (infinitive middle) of [ktaomai].

   8:21 Lot [kleros]. Same idea as "part" [meris], only as a figure.
   Matter [logoi]. Literally, word or subject (as in Lu 1:4; Ac 15:6), the
   power of communicating the Holy Spirit. This use of [logos] is in the
   ancient Greek. Straight [eutheia]. Quotation from Ps 78:37. Originally
   a mathematically straight line as in Ac 9:11, then moral rectitude as
   here.

   8:22 Wickedness [kakias]. Only here in Luke's writings, though old word
   and in LXX (cf. 1Pe 2:1, 16). If perhaps [ei ara]. Si forte. This
   idiom, though with the future indicative and so a condition of the
   first class (determined as fulfilled), yet minimizes the chance of
   forgiveness as in Mr 11:13. Peter may have thought that his sin was
   close to the unpardonable sin (Mt 12:31), but he does not close the
   door of hope. The thought [he epinoia]. Old Greek word from [epinoeO],
   to think upon, and so purpose. Only here in the N.T.

   8:23 That thou art [se onta]. Participle in indirect discourse after
   [horO] (I see). In the gall of bitterness [eis cholen pikrias]. Old
   word from [cholas] either from [cheO], to pour, or [chloe], yellowish
   green, bile or gall. In the N.T. only in Mt 27:34 and here. In LXX in
   sense of wormwood as well as bile. See De 29:18; 32:32; La 3:15; Job
   16:14. "Gall and bitterness" in De 29:18. Here the gall is described by
   the genitive [pikrias] as consisting in "bitterness." In Heb 12:15 "a
   root of bitterness," a bitter root. This word [pikria] in the N.T. only
   here and Heb 12:15; Ro 3:14; Eph 4:31. The "bond of iniquity"
   [sundesmon adikias] is from Isa 58:6. Paul uses this word of peace (Eph
   4:3), of love (Col 3:14), of the body (Col 2:19). Peter describes
   Simon's offer as poison and a chain.

   8:24 Pray ye for me [Deethete humeis huper emou]. Emphasis on [humeis]
   (you). First aorist passive imperative. Simon is thoroughly frightened
   by Peter's words, but shows no sign of personal repentance or change of
   heart. He wants to escape the penalty for his sin and hopes that Peter
   can avert it. Peter had clearly diagnosed his case. He was an
   unconverted man in spite of his profession of faith and baptism. There
   is no evidence that he ever changed his life at all. Which [hOn].
   Genitive by attraction of the accusative relative [ha] to case of the
   unexpressed antecedent [toutOn] (of those things), a common Greek
   idiom.

   8:25 They therefore [hoi men oun]. Demonstrative [hoi] with [men] (no
   following [de] and the inferential [oun] (therefore) as often in Acts
   (1:6, etc.). Returned [hupestrephon]. Imperfect active picturing the
   joyful journey of preaching [eueggelizonto], imperfect middle) to the
   Samaritan villages. Peter and John now carried on the work of Philip to
   the Samaritans. This issue was closed.

   8:26 Toward the South [kata mesembrian]. Old word from [mesos] and
   [hemera], midday or noon as in Ac 22:16, the only other example in the
   N.T. That may be the idea here also, though "towards the South" gets
   support from the use of [kata liba] in Ac 27:12. The same is desert
   [haute estin eremos]. Probably a parenthetical remark by Luke to give
   an idea of the way. One of the ways actually goes through a desert.
   Gaza itself was a strong city that resisted Alexander the Great five
   months. It was destroyed by the Romans after war broke out with the
   Jews.

   8:27 A eunuch of great authority [eunouchos dunastes]. Eunuchs were
   often employed by oriental rulers in high posts. Dynasty comes from
   this old word [dunastes] used of princes in Lu 1:52 and of God in 1Ti
   6:15. Eunuchs were not allowed to be Jews in the full sense (De 23:1),
   but only proselytes of the gate. But Christianity is spreading to
   Samaritans and to eunuchs. Candace [Kandakes]. Not a personal name, but
   like Pharaoh and Ptolemy, the title of the queens of Ethiopia. This
   eunuch apparently brought the gospel to Ethiopia. Treasure [gazes].
   Persian word, common in late Greek and Latin for the royal treasure,
   here only in the N.T. For to worship [proskunesOn]. Future active
   participle expressing purpose, a common idiom in the ancient Greek, but
   rare in the N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1128).

   8:28 Was reading [aneginOsken]. Imperfect active descriptive, not
   periphrastic like the two preceding verbs (was returning and sitting).
   He was reading aloud as Philip "heard him reading" [ekousen auton
   anaginOskontos], a common practice among orientals. He had probably
   purchased this roll of Isaiah in Jerusalem and was reading the LXX
   Greek text. See imperfect again in verse 32.

   8:29 Join thyself [kolletheti]. See this vivid word (be glued to, first
   aorist passive imperative) already in 5:13; Lu 10:11; 15:15. Philip
   probably jumped on the running board on the side of the chariot.

   8:30 Understandest thou what thou readest? [Ara ge ginOskeis ha
   anaginOskeis?] The interrogative particle [ara] and the intensive
   particle [ge] indicate doubt on Philip's part. The play [paranomasia]
   upon the words in the Greek is very neat: Do you know what you know
   again (read)? The verb for read [anaginOsko] means to know the letters
   again, recognize, read. The famous comment of Julian about the
   Christian writings is often quoted: [AnegnOn, egnOn, kategnOn] (I read,
   I understood, I condemned). The keen retort was: [AnegnOs, all'ouk
   egnOs, ei gar egnOs, ouk an kategnOs] (You read, but did not
   understand; for if you had understood, you would not have condemned).

   8:31 How can I, except some one shall guide me? [POs gar an dunaimen
   ean me tis hodegesei me?]. This is a mixed condition, the conclusion
   coming first belongs to the fourth class (undetermined with less
   likelihood of being determined) with [an] and the optative, but the
   condition [ean], instead of the usual [ei], and the future indicative)
   is of the first class (determined or fulfilled. Robertson, Grammar, p.
   1022), a common enough phenomenon in the Koine. The eunuch felt the
   need of some one to guide [hodegeO] from [hodegos], guide, and that
   from [hodos], way, and [hegeomai], to lead).

   8:32 The place [he perioche]. See the verb [periechei] so used in 1Pe
   2:6. The word is used either of the section as in Codex A before the
   beginning of Mark or the contents of a passage. He was here reading one
   particular passage (Isa 53:7f.). The quotation is from the LXX which
   has some variations from the Hebrew.

   8:33 Was taken away [erthe]. First aorist passive indicative of [airO],
   to take away. It is not clear what the meaning is here either in the
   Hebrew or the LXX. Knowling suggests that the idea is that justice was
   withheld, done away with, in his death, as it certainly was in the
   death of Christ.

   8:34 Of whom [peri tinos]. Concerning whom, a pertinent inquiry surely
   and one that troubles many critics today.

   8:35 Beginning from this scripture [arxamenos apo tes graphes tautes].
   As a text. Philip needed no better opening than this Messianic passage
   in Isaiah. Preached unto him Jesus [eueggelisato autOi ton Iesoun].
   Philip had no doubt about the Messianic meaning and he knew that Jesus
   was the Messiah. There are scholars who do not find Jesus in the Old
   Testament at all, but Jesus himself did (Lu 24:27) as Philip does here.
   Scientific study of the Old Testament (historical research) misses its
   mark if it fails to find Christ the Center of all history. The
   knowledge of the individual prophet is not always clear, but after
   events throw a backward light that illumines it all (1Pe 1:11f.; 2Pe
   1:19-21).

   8:36 What doth hinder me to be baptized? [Ti kOluei me baptisthenai?].
   Evidently Philip had said something about baptism following faith and
   conversion. verse 37 is not a genuine part of Acts, a western addition.
   Later baptismal liturgies had it.

   8:39 Out of the water [ek tou hudatos]. Not from the edge of the water,
   but up out of the water as in Mr 1:10. Caught away [herpasen]. Suddenly
   and miraculously, for [harpazO], like the Latin rapio, means to carry
   off. Cf. 2Co 12:2; 1Th 4:17. Went on his way [eporeueto]. Kept on
   going, imperfect active.

   8:40 He preached the gospel [eueggelizeto]. Imperfect middle describing
   the evangelistic tour of Philip "till he came to Caesarea" [heOs tou
   elthein auton], genitive articular infinitive with the preposition
   [heOs] and the accusative of general reference) where he made his home
   and headquarters thereafter (Ac 21:28) and was known as the Evangelist.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 9

   9:1 Yet [eti]. As if some time elapsed between the death of Stephen as
   is naturally implied by the progressive persecution described in 8:3.
   The zeal of Saul the persecutor increased with success. Breathing
   threatening and slaughter [enpneOn apeiles kai phonou]. Present active
   participle of old and common verb. Not "breathing out," but "breathing
   in" (inhaling) as in Aeschylus and Plato or "breathing on" (from Homer
   on). The partitive genitive of [apeiles] and [phonou] means that
   threatening and slaughter had come to be the very breath that Saul
   breathed, like a warhorse who sniffed the smell of battle. He breathed
   on the remaining disciples the murder that he had already breathed in
   from the death of the others. He exhaled what he inhaled. Jacob had
   said that "Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf" (Ge 49:27). This greatest
   son of Benjamin was fulfilling this prophecy (Furneaux). The taste of
   blood in the death of Stephen was pleasing to young Saul (8:1) and now
   he revelled in the slaughter of the saints both men and women. In 26:11
   Luke quotes Paul as saying that he was "exceedingly mad against them."

   9:2 Asked [eitesato]. First aorist middle indicative, the indirect
   middle, asked for himself (as a favour to himself). Felten notes that
   "Saul as a Pharisee makes request of a Sadducee" (the high priest)
   either Caiaphas if before A.D. 35, but if in 36 Jonathan, son of
   Caiaphas or if in 37 Theophilus, another son of Caiaphas. Letters
   [epistolas]. Julius Ceasar and Augustus had granted the high priest and
   Sanhedrin jurisdiction over Jews in foreign cities, but this central
   ecclesiastical authority was not always recognized in every local
   community outside of Judea. Paul says that he received his authority to
   go to Damascus from the priests (Acts 26:10) and "the estate of the
   elders" (22:5), that is the Sanhedrin. To Damascus [eis Damaskon]. As
   if no disciples of importance (outside the apostles in Jerusalem) were
   left in Judea. Damascus at this time may have been under the rule of
   Aretas of Arabia (tributary to Rome) as it certainly was a couple of
   years later when Saul escaped in a basket (2Co 11:32). This old city is
   the most enduring in the history of the world (Knowling). It is some
   150 miles Northeast from Jerusalem and watered by the river Abana from
   Anti-Lebanon. Here the Jews were strong in numbers (10,000 butchered by
   Nero later) and here some disciples had found refuge from Saul's
   persecution in Judea and still worshipped in the synagogues. Paul's
   language in Ac 26:11 seems to mean that Damascus is merely one of other
   "foreign cities" to which he carried the persecution. If he found [ean
   heurei]. Third class condition with aorist subjunctive retained after
   secondary tense (asked). The Way [tes hodou]. A common method in the
   Acts for describing Christianity as the Way of life, absolutely as also
   in 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14, 22 or the way of salvation (16:17) or the way
   of the Lord (18:25). It is a Jewish definition of life as in Isa 40:3
   "the way of the Lord," Ps 1:6 "the way of the righteous," "the way of
   the wicked." Jesus called himself "the way" (Joh 14:6), the only way to
   the Father. The so-called Epistle of Barnabas presents the Two Ways.
   The North American Indians call Christianity the Jesus Road. That he
   might bring them bound [hopOs dedemenous agagei]. Final clause with
   [hopOs] (less common than [hina] and aorist (effective) subjunctive
   [agagei], reduplicated aorist of [agO], common verb) and perfect
   passive participle [dedemenous] of [deO], in a state of sheer
   helplessness like his other victims both men and women. Three times
   (8:3; 9:2; 22:4) this fact of persecuting women is mentioned as a
   special blot in Paul's cruelty (the third time by Paul himself) and one
   of the items in his being chief of sinners (1Ti 1:15).

   9:3 As he journeyed [en tOi poreuesthai]. Luke's common idiom for a
   temporal clause (in the journeying), [en] with the locative articular
   middle infinitive. Drew nigh [eggizein]. Present active infinitive, was
   drawing nigh. Shone round about him [auton periestrapsen]. First aorist
   (ingressive) active indicative of [periastraptO], late compound verb
   common in LXX and Byzantine writers, here and 22:6 alone in the N.T. "A
   light from heaven suddenly flashed around him." It was like a flash of
   lightning. Paul uses the same verb in 22:5, but in 26:13 he employs
   [perilampsan] (shining around). There are numerous variations in the
   historical narrative of Saul's conversion in 9:3-18 and Luke's report
   of Paul's two addresses, one on the steps of the Tower of Antonia
   facing the murderous mob (22:6-16), the other before Festus and Agrippa
   (26:12-20). A great deal of capital has been made of these variations
   to the discredit of Luke as a writer as if he should have made Paul's
   two speeches conform at every point with his own narrative. This
   objection has no weight except for those who hold that Luke composed
   Paul's speeches freely as some Greek writers used to do. But, if Luke
   had notes of Paul's speeches or help from Paul himself, he naturally
   preserved the form of the two addresses without trying to make them
   agree with each other in all details or with his own narrative in
   chapter 9. Luke evidently attached great importance to the story of
   Saul's conversion as the turning point not simply in the career of the
   man, but an epoch in the history of apostolic Christianity. In broad
   outline and in all essentials the three accounts agree and testify to
   the truthfulness of the account of the conversion of Saul. It is
   impossible to overestimate the worth to the student of Christianity of
   this event from every angle because we have in Paul's Epistles his own
   emphasis on the actual appearance of Jesus to him as the fact that
   changed his whole life (1Co 15:8; Ga 1:16f.). The variations that
   appear in the three accounts do not mar the story, when rightly
   understood, as we shall see. Here, for instance, Luke simply mentions
   "a light from heaven," while in 22:6 Paul calls it "a great [hikanon]
   light" "about noon" and in 26:13 "above the brightness of the sun," as
   it would have to be "at midday" with the sun shining.

   9:4 He fell upon the earth [pesOn epi ten gen]. Second aorist active
   participle. So in 22:7 Paul says: "I fell unto the ground" [epesa eis
   to edaphos] using an old word rather than the common [gen]. In 26:14
   Paul states that "we were all fallen to the earth" [pantOn katapesontOn
   hemOn eis ten gen], genitive absolute construction). But here in verse
   7 "the men that journeyed with him stood speechless" [histekeisan
   eneoi]. But surely the points of time are different. In 26:14 Paul
   refers to the first appearance of the vision when all fell to the
   earth. Here in verse 7 Luke refers to what occurred after the vision
   when both Saul and the men had risen from the ground. Saul, Saul
   [Saoul, Saoul]. The Hebrew form occurs also in 22:7; 26:14 where it is
   expressly stated that the voice was in the Hebrew (Aramaic) tongue as
   also in 9:17 (Ananias). Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 316) terms this
   use of [Saoul] "the historian's sense of liturgical rhythm." For the
   repetition of names by Jesus note Lu 10:41 (Martha, Martha), Lu 22:31
   (Simon, Simon). Me [me]. In persecuting the disciples, Saul was
   persecuting Jesus, as the words of Jesus in verse 5 made plain. Christ
   had already spoken of the mystic union between himself and his
   followers (Mt 10:40; 25:40, 45; Joh 15:1-5). The proverb (Pindar) that
   Jesus quotes to Saul about kicking against the goad is genuine in
   26:14, but not here.

   9:5 Lord [kurie]. It is open to question if [kurie] should not here be
   translated "Sir" as in 16:30 and in Mt 21:29,30; Joh 5:7; 12:21; 20:15;
   and should be so in Joh 9:36. It is hardly likely that at this stage
   Saul recognized Jesus as Lord, though he does so greet him in 22:10
   "What shall I do, Lord?" Saul may have recognized the vision as from
   God as Cornelius says "Lord" in 10:4. Saul surrendered instantly as
   Thomas did (Joh 20:28) and as little Samuel (1Sa 3:9). This surrender
   of the will to Christ was the conversion of Saul. He saw a real Person,
   the Risen Christ, to whom he surrendered his life. On this point he
   never wavered for a moment to the end.

   9:6 The best MSS. do not have "trembling and astonished," and "What
   wilt thou have me to do, Lord?" The Textus Receptus put these words in
   here without the authority of a Greek codex. See 22:10 above for the
   genuine text. It shall be told thee [lalethesetai]. Future passive
   indicative of [laleO]. It is hardly likely that Luke records all that
   Jesus said to Saul, but more was to come on his arrival in Damascus.
   Saul had received all that he could bear just now (Joh 16:12). What
   [hoti]. Rare in Koine use of this indefinite neuter relative in an
   indirect question, the only example in the N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, p.
   731). Human agents like Ananias can finish what Jesus by supernatural
   manifestation has here begun in Saul.

   9:7 That journeyed with him [hoi sunodeuontes autOi]. Not in the older
   Greek, but in the Koine, with the associative instrumental. Speechless
   [eneoi]. Mute. Only here in N.T., though old word. Hearing the voice,
   but beholding no man [akouontes men tes phOnes, medena de theOrountes].
   Two present active participles in contrast [men, de]. In 22:9 Paul says
   that the men "beheld the light" [to men phOs etheasanto], but evidently
   did not discern the person. Paul also says there, "but they heard not
   the voice of him that spake to me" [ten de phOnen ouk ekousan tou
   lalountos moi]. Instead of this being a flat contradiction of what Luke
   says in 9:7 it is natural to take it as being likewise (as with the
   "light" and "no one") a distinction between the "sound" (original sense
   of [phOne] as in Joh 3:8) and the separate words spoken. It so happens
   that [akouO] is used either with the accusative (the extent of the
   hearing) or the genitive (the specifying). It is possible that such a
   distinction here coincides with the two senses of [phOne]. They heard
   the sound (9:7), but did not understand the words (22:9). However, this
   distinction in case with [akouO], though possible and even probable
   here, is by no means a necessary one for in Joh 3:8 where [phOnen]
   undoubtedly means "sound" the accusative occurs as Luke uses [ekousen
   phOnen] about Saul in Ac 9:4. Besides in 22:7 Paul uses [ekousa phOnes]
   about himself, but [ekousa phOnen] about himself in 26:14,
   interchangeably.

   9:8 He saw nothing [ouden eblepen]. Imperfect active indicative, was
   seeing nothing. "The glory of that light" (22:11) when he saw Jesus had
   blinded his eyes now wide open [aneOigmenOn], perfect passive
   participle of [anoigO] with double reduplication). The blindness was
   proof that something had happened to him and that it was no
   hallucination that he had seen the Risen Christ. Saul arose after the
   others were on their feet. They led him by the hand [cheiragOgountes].
   From [cheiragOgos] [cheir], hand and [agO], to lead). Only here in the
   N.T., but in LXX and late writers though not in the old Greek. It was a
   pathetic picture to see the masterful Saul, victorious persecutor and
   conqueror of the disciples, now helpless as a child.

   9:9 Not seeing [me blepOn]. The usual negative [me] of the participle.
   It was a crisis for Saul, this sudden blindness for three days [hemeras
   treis], accusative of extent of time). Later (Ga 4:15) Paul has an
   affection of the eyes which may have been caused by this experience on
   the road to Damascus or at least his eyes may have been predisposed by
   it to weakness in the glare of the Syrian sun in the land where today
   so much eye trouble exists. He neither ate nor drank anything, for his
   appetite had gone as often happens in a crisis of the soul. These must
   have been days of terrible stress and strain.

   9:10 Ananias [Hananias]. Name common enough (cf. 5:1 for another
   Ananias) and means "Jehovah is gracious." Nomen et omen (Knowling).
   This Ananias had the respect of both Jews and Christians in Damascus
   (22:12). In a vision [en horamati]. Zeller and others scout the idea of
   the historicity of this vision as supernatural. Even Furneaux holds
   that "it is a characteristic of the Jewish Christian sources to point
   out the Providential ordering of events by the literary device of a
   vision," as "in the early chapters of Matthew's and Luke's Gospels." He
   is content with this "beautiful expression of the belief" with no
   interest in the actual facts. But that is plain illusion, not to say
   delusion, and makes both Paul and Luke deceived by the story of Ananias
   (9:10-18; 22:12-16, 26). One MS. of the old Latin Version does omit the
   vision to Ananias and that is basis enough for those who deny the
   supernatural aspects of Christianity.

   9:11 To the street [epi ten rhumen]. See on Lu 14:21. A run way (from
   [rheO], to run) between the houses. So were the narrow lanes or alleys
   called streets and finally in later Greek the word is applied to
   streets even when broad. Straight [eutheian]. Most of the city lanes
   were crooked like the streets of Boston (old cow-paths, people say),
   but this one still runs "in a direct line from the eastern to the
   western gate of the city" (Vincent). Since the ancients usually rebuilt
   on the same sites, it is probable that the line of the street of that
   name today is the same, though the actual level has been much raised.
   Hence the identification of the house of Ananias and the house of Judas
   are very precarious.

   9:12 Coming in and laying [eiselthonta kai epithenta]. Second aorist
   (ingressive) active participles picturing the punctiliar act as a sort
   of indirect discourse after verbs of sensation (Robertson, Grammar, pp.
   1040-2). Some ancient documents do not have "in a vision" here. Receive
   his sight [anablepsei]. First aorist active subjunctive with [hopOs]
   (purpose). See again as in 9:17.

   9:13 How much evil [hosa kaka]. How many evil things. Saul's reputation
   (26:10) as a persecutor had preceded him. To thy saints [tois hagiois].
   Dative of disadvantage. "Used here for the first time as a name for the
   Christians" (Knowling), but it came to be the common and normal
   (Hackett) term for followers of Christ (9:32, 41; 26:10; 1Co 1:2,
   etc.). This common word is from [to hagos], religious awe or reverence
   and is applied to God's name (Lu 1:49), God's temple (Mt 24:15), God's
   people as set apart for God (Lu 1:70; 2:23; Ro 1:7, etc.). Ananias in
   his ignorance saw in Saul only the man with an evil reputation while
   Jesus saw in Saul the man transformed by grace to be a messenger of
   mercy.

   9:14 Hath authority [echei exousian]. Probably Ananias had received
   letters from the Christians left in Jerusalem warning him of the coming
   of Saul. The protest of Ananias to Jesus against any dealing with Saul
   is a fine illustration of our own narrow ignorance in our rebellious
   moods against the will of God.

   9:15 A chosen vessel [skeuos ekloges]. A vessel of choice or selection.
   The genitive of quality is common in the Hebrew, as in the vernacular
   Koine. Jesus chose Saul before Saul chose Jesus. He felt of himself
   that he was an earthen vessel (2Co 4:7) unworthy of so great a
   treasure. It was a great message that Ananias had to bear to Saul. He
   told it in his own way (9:17; 22:14f.) and in 26:16f. Paul blends the
   message of Jesus to Ananias with that to him as one. Before the
   Gentiles [enOpion tOn ethnOn]. This was the chief element in the call
   of Saul. He was to be an apostle to the Gentiles (Eph 3:6-12).

   9:16 I will shew [hupodeixO]. Beforehand as a warning as in Lu 3:7 and
   from time to time. He must suffer [dei auton pathein]. Constative
   aorist active infinitive [pathein], from [paschO] covering the whole
   career of Saul. Suffering is one element in the call that Saul
   receives. He will learn "how many things" [hosa] are included in this
   list by degrees and by experience. A glance at 2Co 10-12 will show one
   the fulfilment of this prophecy. But it was the "gift" of Christ to
   Paul to go on suffering [paschein], present infinitive, Php 1:39).

   9:17 Laying his hands on him [epitheis ep' auton tas cheiras]. As in
   the vision Saul saw (verse 12). Brother Saul [Saoul adelphe]. All
   suspicion has vanished and Ananias takes Saul to his heart as a brother
   in Christ. It was a gracious word to Saul now under suspicion on both
   sides. The Lord, even Jesus [ho kurios, Iesous]. Undoubted use of
   [kurios] as Lord and applied to Jesus. Who appeared [ho ophtheis].
   First aorist passive participle of [horaO], was seen as in 26:16 and
   with the dative also [soi]. Thou camest [erchou]. Imperfect indicative
   middle, "thou wert coming." Be filled with the Holy Spirit [plestheis
   pneumatos hagiou]. This enduement of special power he will need as an
   apostle (Hackett) and as promised by Jesus (1:8; Ga 2:7).

   9:18 Fell off [apepesan]. Second aorist active indicative (note--an
   ending like first aorist) of [apopiptO], old verb, but here alone in
   the N.T. As if it were scales [hOs lepides]. Chiefly late word (LXX)
   from [lepO], to peel, and only here in the N.T. See Tobit 11:13, "The
   white film peeled from his eyes" [elepisthe]. Luke does not say that
   actual "scales" fell from the eyes of Saul, but that it felt that way
   to him as his sight returned, "as if" [hOs]. Medical writers use the
   word [lepis] for pieces of the skin that fall off (Hobart, Medical
   Language of St. Luke, p. 39). Luke may have heard Paul tell of this
   vivid experience. Was baptized [ebaptisthe]. First aorist passive
   indicative. Apparently by Ananias (22:16) as a symbol of the new life
   in Christ already begun, possibly in the pool in the house of Judas as
   today water is plentiful in Damascus or in Abana or Pharpar (Furneaux),
   better than all the waters of Israel according to Naaman (2Ki 5:12).

   9:19 Was strengthened [enischuthe]. First aorist passive indicative of
   [enischuO], to receive strength [ischus], comparatively late verb and
   here only in the N.T. save Lu 22:43 where it is doubtful. Poor verse
   division. This clause belongs in sense to verse 18. Some days [hemeras
   tinas]. An indefinite period, probably not long, the early period in
   Damascus before Saul left for Arabia (Ga 1:13-24).

   9:20 He proclaimed Jesus [ekerussen ton Iesoun]. Imperfect indicative,
   inchoative, began to preach. Jesus, not Christ, is the correct text
   here. He did this first preaching in the Jewish synagogues, a habit of
   his life when possible, and following the example of Jesus. That he is
   the Son of God [hoti houtos estin ho huios tou theou]. This is Paul's
   platform as a Christian preacher, one that he always occupied to the
   very end. It was a complete reversal of his previous position. Jesus
   had turned him completely around. It is the conclusion that Saul now
   drew from the vision of the Risen Christ and the message through
   Ananias. By "the Son of God" Saul means the Messiah of promise and
   hope, the Messianic sense of the Baptist (Joh 1:34) and of Nathanael
   (Joh 1:49) for Saul is now proclaiming his faith in Jesus in the very
   synagogues where he had meant to arrest those who professed their faith
   in him. Peter laid emphasis on the Resurrection of Jesus as a glorious
   fact and proclaimed Jesus as Lord and Christ. Paul boldly calls Jesus
   the Son of God with full acknowledgment of his deity from the very
   start. Thomas had come to this place slowly (Joh 20:28). Saul begins
   with this truth and never leaves it. With this faith he can shake the
   world. There is no power in any other preaching.

   9:21 Were amazed [existanto]. Imperfect middle indicative of
   [existemi]. They continued to stand out of themselves in astonishment
   at this violent reversal in Saul the persecutor. Made havock
   [porthesas]. First aorist active participle of [portheO], to lay waste,
   an old verb, but only here and Ga 1:13, 23 by Paul, an interesting
   coincidence. It is the old proverb about Saul among the prophets (1Sa
   10:12) revived with a new meaning (Furneaux). Had come [eleluthei].
   Past perfect indicative active. Might bring [agagei]. Second aorist
   (effective) active subjunctive of [agO] with [hina] (purpose). Bound
   [dedemenous]. Perfect passive participle of [deO]. Interesting tenses.

   9:22 Increased the more [mallon enedunamouto]. Imperfect passive
   indicative of [endunamoO], to receive power (late verb), progressive
   increase in strength as opposition grew. Saul's recantation stirred
   controversy and Saul grew in power. See also Paul in Php 4:13; 1Ti
   1:12; 2Ti 2:1; 4:17; Ro 4:20. Christ, the dynamo of spiritual energy,
   was now pouring power (Ac 1:8) into Paul who is already filled with the
   Holy Spirit (Ac 9:17). Confounded [sunechunnen]. Imperfect active
   indicative of [sunchunnO] (late form of [suncheO], to pour together,
   commingle, make confusion.) The more Saul preached, the more the Jews
   were confused. Proving [sunbibazOn]. Present active participle of
   [sunbibazO], old verb to make go together, to coalesce, to knit
   together. It is the very word that Luke will use in 16:10 of the
   conclusion reached at Troas concerning the vision of Paul. Here Saul
   took the various items in the life of Jesus of Nazareth and found in
   them the proof that he was in reality "the Messiah" [ho Christos]. This
   method of argument Paul continued to use with the Jews (Ac 17:3). It
   was irresistible argument and spread consternation among the Jews. It
   was the most powerful piece of artillery in the Jewish camp that was
   suddenly turned round upon them. It is probable that at this juncture
   Saul went into Arabia for several years (Ga 1:12-24). Luke makes no
   mention of this important event, but he leaves ample room for it at
   this point.

   9:23 When many days were fulfilled [HOs eplerounto hemerai hikanai].
   Imperfect passive indicative of [pleroO], old and common verb, were in
   process of being fulfilled. How "many" (considerable, [hikanai], common
   word for a long period) Luke does not say nor does he say that Saul
   spent all of this period in Damascus, as we know from Ga 1:16-18 was
   not the case. Paul there states definitely that he went away from
   Damascus to Arabia and returned there before going back to Jerusalem
   and that the whole period was about "three years" which need not mean
   three full years, but at least portions of three. Most of the three
   years was probably spent in Arabia because of the two explosions in
   Damascus (before his departure and on his return) and because he was
   unknown in Jerusalem as a Christian on his arrival there. It cannot be
   argued from the frequent lacunae in the Acts that Luke tells all that
   was true or that he knew. He had his own methods and aims as every
   historian has. We are at perfect liberty to supplement the narrative in
   the Acts with items from Paul's Epistles. So we must assume the return
   of Saul from Arabia at this juncture, between verses 22, 23, when Saul
   resumed his preaching in the Jewish synagogues with renewed energy and
   grasp after the period of mature reflection and readjustment in Arabia.
   Took counsel together [sunebouleusanto]. First aorist (effective)
   middle indicative of [sunbouleuO], old and common verb for counselling
   [bouleuO] together [sun]. Things had reached a climax. It was worse
   than before he left for Arabia. Paul was now seeing the fulfilment of
   the prophecy of Jesus about him (9:16). To kill him [anelein auton].
   Second aorist (effective) active infinitive of [anaireO], to take up,
   to make away with, to kill (Lu 23:32; Ac 12:1, etc.). The infinitive
   expresses purpose here as is done in verse 24 by [hopOs] and the aorist
   active subjunctive of the same verb [anelOsin]. Saul now knew what
   Stephen had suffered at his hands as his own life was in peril in the
   Jewish quarter of Damascus. It was a picture of his old self. He may
   even have been scourged here (2Co 11:24).

   9:24 Plot [epiboule]. Old word for a plan [boule] against [epi] one. In
   the N.T. only in Acts (9:24; 20:3, 19; 23:30). They watched
   [pareterounto]. Imperfect middle indicative of [paratereO], common verb
   in late Greek for watching beside [para] or insidiously or on the sly
   as in Lu 6:7, they kept on watching by day and night to kill him. In
   2Co 11:32 Paul says that the Ethnarch of Aretas "kept guard"
   [ephrourei], imperfect active of [phroureO] to seize him. Probably the
   Jews obtained the consent of the Ethnarch and had him appoint some of
   them as guards or watchers at the gate of the city.

   9:25 Through the wall [dia tou teichous]. Paul in 2Co 11:33 explains
   [dia tou teichous] as being [dia thuridos] (through a window) which
   opened into the house on the inside of the wall as is true today in
   Damascus as Hackett saw there. See Jos 2:15f. (cf. 1Sa 19:12) for the
   way that Rahab let out the spies "by a cord through the window."
   Lowering him [auton chalasantes]. First aorist active participle of
   [chalaO], old and common verb in a nautical sense (Ac 27:17, 30) as
   well as otherwise as here. Same verb used by Paul of this experience
   (2Co 11:33). In a basket [en sphuridi]. The word used when the four
   thousand were fed (Mr 8:8; Mt 15:37). A large basket plaited of reeds
   and distinguished in Mr 8:19f. (Mt 16:9f.) from the smaller [kophinos].
   Paul uses [sargane], a basket made of ropes. This escape by night by
   the help of the men whom he had come to destroy was a shameful memory
   to Paul (2Co 11:33). Wendt thinks that the coincidences in language
   here prove that Luke had read II Corinthians. That, of course, is quite
   possible.

   9:26 He assayed [epeirazen]. Imperfect active of conative action. To
   join himself [kollasthai]. Present middle (direct) infinitive of
   conative action again. Same word [kollaO] in Lu 15:15; Ac 10:28. See on
   Mt 19:5 for discussion. Were all afraid of him [pantes ephobounto
   auton]. They were fearing him. Imperfect middle picturing the state of
   mind of the disciples who had vivid recollections of his conduct when
   last here. What memories Saul had on this return journey to Jerusalem
   after three years. He had left a conquering hero of Pharisaism. He
   returns distrusted by the disciples and regarded by the Pharisees as a
   renegade and a turncoat. He made no effort to get in touch with the
   Sanhedrin who had sent him to Damascus. He had escaped the plots of the
   Jews in Damascus only to find himself the object of suspicion by the
   disciples in Jerusalem who had no proof of his sincerity in his alleged
   conversion. Not believing [me pisteuontes]. They had probably heard of
   his conversion, but they frankly disbelieved the reports and regarded
   him as a hypocrite or a spy in a new role to ruin them. Was [estin].
   The present tense is here retained in indirect discourse according to
   the common Greek idiom.

   9:27 Took him [epilabomenos]. Second aorist middle (indirect)
   participle of [epilambanO], common verb to lay hold of. Barnabas saw
   the situation and took Saul to himself and listened to his story and
   believed it. It is to the credit of Barnabas that he had the insight
   and the courage to stand by Saul at the crucial moment in his life when
   the evidence seemed to be against him. It is a pleasing hypothesis that
   this influential disciple from Cyprus had gone to the University of
   Tarsus where he met Saul. If so, he would know more of him than those
   who only knew his record as a persecutor of Christians. That fact
   Barnabas knew also, but he was convinced that Jesus had changed the
   heart of Saul and he used his great influence (Ac 4:36; 11:22) to win
   the favour of the apostles, Peter in particular (Ga 1:19) and James the
   half-brother of Jesus. The other apostles were probably out of the city
   as Paul says that he did not see them. To the apostles [pros tous
   apostolous]. Both Barnabas and James are termed apostles in the general
   sense, though not belonging to the twelve, as Paul did not, though
   himself later a real apostle. So Barnabas introduced Saul to Peter and
   vouched for his story, declared it fully [diegesato], in detail)
   including Saul's vision of Jesus [eiden ton kurion] as the vital thing
   and Christ's message to Saul [elalesen autOi] and Saul's bold preaching
   [eparresiasato], first aorist middle indicative of [parresiazO] from
   [pan--resia] telling it all as in Ac 2:29). Peter was convinced and
   Saul was his guest for two weeks (Ga 1:18) with delightful fellowship
   [historesai]. He had really come to Jerusalem mainly "to visit" (to
   see) Peter, but not to receive a commission from him. He had that from
   the Lord (Ga 1:1f.). Both Peter and James could tell Saul of their
   special experiences with the Risen Christ. Furneaux thinks that Peter
   was himself staying at the home of Mary the mother of John Mark (Ac
   12:12) who was a cousin of Barnabas (Col 4:10). This is quite possible.
   At any rate Saul is now taken into the inner circle of the disciples in
   Jerusalem.

   9:28 Going in and going out [eisporeumenos kai ekporeuomenos]. Barnabas
   and Peter and James opened all the doors for Saul and the fear of the
   disciples vanished.

   9:29 Preaching boldly [parresiazomenos]. For a while. Evidently Saul
   did not extend his preaching outside of Jerusalem (Ga 1:22) and in the
   city preached mainly in the synagogues of the Hellenists [pros tous
   Hellenistas] as Stephen had done (Ac 8:9). As a Cilician Jew he knew
   how to speak to the Hellenists. Disputed [sunezetei]. Imperfect active
   of [sunzeteO], the very verb used in 6:9 of the disputes with Stephen
   in these very synagogues in one of which (Cilicia) Saul had probably
   joined issue with Stephen to his own discomfort. It was intolerable to
   these Hellenistic Jews now to hear Saul taking the place of Stephen and
   using the very arguments that Stephen had employed. But they went about
   to kill him [Hoi de epecheiroun anelein auton]. Demonstrative [hoi]
   with [de] and the conative imperfect of [epicheireO], to put the hand
   to, to try, an old verb used in the N.T. only three times (Lu 1:1; Ac
   9:29; 19:3). They offer to Saul the same conclusive answer that he gave
   to Stephen, death. Paul tells how the Lord Jesus appeared to him at
   this juncture in a vision in the temple (Ac 22:17-21) with the distinct
   command to leave Jerusalem and how Paul protested that he was willing
   to meet the fate of Stephen in whose death he had a shameful part. That
   is to Saul's credit, but the Lord did not want Saul to be put to death
   yet. His crown of martyrdom will come later.

   9:30 Knew it [epignontes]. Second aorist active participle of
   [epiginOskO], to know fully. The disciples saw it clearly, so they
   conducted [kategagon], effective second aorist active indicative of
   [katagO]. Sent forth [exapesteilan]. Double compound [ex], out, [apo],
   away or off). Sent him out and off to Tarsus [eis Tarson]. Silence is
   preserved by Luke. But it takes little imagination to picture the scene
   at home when this brilliant young rabbi, the pride of Gamaliel, returns
   home a preacher of the despised Jesus of Nazareth whose disciples he
   had so relentlessly persecuted. What will father, mother, sister think
   of him now?

   9:31 So the church [He men oun ekklesia]. The singular [ekklesia] is
   undoubtedly the true reading here (all the great documents have it so).
   By this time there were churches scattered over Judea, Galilee, and
   Samaria (Ga 1:22), but Luke either regards the disciples in Palestine
   as still members of the one great church in Jerusalem (instance already
   the work of Philip in Samaria and soon of Peter in Joppa and Caesarea)
   or he employs the term [ekklesia] in a geographical or collective sense
   covering all of Palestine. The strictly local sense we have seen
   already in 8:1, 3 (and Mt 18:17) and the general spiritual sense in Mt
   16:18. But in Ac 8:3 it is plain that the term is applied to the
   organization of Jerusalem Christians even when scattered in their
   homes. The use of [men oun] (so) is Luke's common way of gathering up
   the connection. The obvious meaning is that the persecution ceased
   because the persecutor had been converted. The wolf no longer ravined
   the sheep. It is true also that the effort of Caligula A.D. 39 to set
   up his image in the temple in Jerusalem for the Jews to worship greatly
   excited the Jews and gave them troubles of their own (Josephus, Ant.
   XVIII. 8, 2-9). Had peace [eichen eirenen]. Imperfect active. Kept on
   having peace, enjoying peace, because the persecution had ceased. Many
   of the disciples came back to Jerusalem and the apostles began to make
   preaching tours out from the city. This idiom [echO eirenen] occurs
   again in Ro 5:1 [eirenen echOmen], present active subjunctive) where it
   has been grievously misunderstood. There it is an exhortation to keep
   on enjoying the peace with God already made, not to make peace with God
   which would be [eirenen schOmen] (ingressive aorist subjunctive).
   Edified [oikodomoumene]. Present passive participle, linear action
   also. One result of the enjoyment of peace after the persecution was
   the continued edification (Latin word aedificatio for building up a
   house), a favourite figure with Paul (1Co 14; Eph 3) and scattered
   throughout the N.T., old Greek verb. In 1Pe 2:5 Peter speaks of "the
   spiritual house" throughout the five Roman provinces being "built up"
   (cf. Mt 16:18). In the comfort of the Holy Spirit [tei paraklesei tou
   hagiou pneumatos]. Either locative (in) or instrumental case (by). The
   Holy Spirit had been promised by Jesus as "another Paraclete" and now
   this is shown to be true. The only instance in Acts of the use of
   [paraklesis] with the Holy Spirit. The word, of course, means calling
   to one's side [parakaleO] either for advice or for consolation. Was
   multiplied [eplethuneto]. Imperfect middle passive. The multiplication
   of the disciples kept pace with the peace, the edification, the walking
   in the fear of the Lord, the comfort of the Holy Spirit. The blood of
   the martyrs was already becoming the seed of the church. Stephen had
   not borne his witness in vain.

   9:32 Lydda [Ludda]. In O.T. Lod (1Ch 8:12) and near Joppa. Later
   Diospolis.

   9:33 Aenias [Ainean]. Old Greek name and so probably a Hellenistic Jew.
   He was apparently a disciple already (the saint, verse 32). Luke the
   physician notes that he had been bed ridden for eight years. See on
   5:15 for "bed" [krabattou] and 8:7; Lu 5:18 for "paralyzed"
   [paralelumenos], perfect passive participle of [paraluO] with [en],
   periphrastic past perfect passive).

   9:34 Healeth [iatai]. Aoristic present middle indicative, heals here
   and now. Make thy bed [strOson seautOi]. First aorist (ingressive)
   active imperative of [strOnnumi] [-uO]. Old word with "bed" [krabatton]
   understood as the object. Literally, spread thy bed for thyself (dative
   case), what others for eight years have done for thee.

   9:35 Sharon [SarOna]. The Plain of Sharon, not a town. Thirty miles
   long from Joppa to Caesarea.

   9:36 At Joppa [En Ioppei]. The modern Jaffa, the port of Jerusalem (2Ch
   2:16). Disciple [mathetria]. Feminine form of [mathetes], a learner
   from [manthanO], to learn, a late word and only here in the N.T.
   Tabitha [Tabeitha]. Aramaic form of the Hebrew Tsebi and, like the
   Greek word Dorcas [Dorkas], means Gazelle, "the creature with the
   beautiful look" (or eyes), from [derkomai]. The gazelle was a favourite
   type for beauty in the orient (Song of Solomon 2:9, 17; 4:5; 7:3). She
   may have had both the Aramaic and the Greek name, Tabitha Dorcas like
   John Mark. There is nothing said about a husband and so she was
   probably unmarried. She is the second woman mentioned by name after
   Pentecost (Sapphira the other). She did her beautiful deeds by herself.
   She did not have a Dorcas society. Did [epoiei]. Imperfect active, her
   habit.

   9:37 In an upper chamber [en huperOiOi]. See on 1:13. Also in verse 39.
   In that house. This service was rendered by the women, though Luke has
   [lousantes] (masculine plural aorist active participle of [louO], a
   general way of saying "they washed." The interment was not hurried as
   in Jerusalem (Ananias and Sapphira) and the upper room is where the
   body was usually placed.

   9:38 Delay not [me okneseis]. Ingressive aorist active subjunctive in
   prohibition. Direct discourse and not indirect as late MSS. have
   (aorist active infinitive, [oknesai]. Possibly the two messengers
   started before Dorcas was quite dead, though we do not know. Peter had
   recently healed Aeneas and the disciples may have had faith enough to
   believe that he could raise the dead by the power of Christ. W. M.
   Ramsay doubts if Dorcas was really dead, but why see legends in these
   supernatural events?

   9:39 Stood by him [parestesan autOi]. Second aorist active indicative,
   intransitive, of [paristemi]. Vivid picture of this group of widows as
   they stood around Peter, weeping [klaiousai] and showing
   [epideiknumenai], present middle as belonging to themselves, pointing
   with pride to) the very inner garments [chitOnas] and outer garments
   [himatia], like the Latin tunica and toga, which she made from time to
   time [epoiei], imperfect active, repeated action). It was a
   heart-breaking scene.

   9:40 Put them all forth [ekbalOn exO pantas]. Second aorist (effective)
   active participle of [ekballO], a rather strong word, perhaps with some
   difficulty. Cf. Mr 5:40 which incident Peter may have recalled. The
   words are not genuine in Lu 8:54. Peter's praying alone reminds one of
   Elijah (1Ki 17:20) and the widow's son and Elisha for the Shunammite's
   son (2Ki 4:33). Tabitha, arise [Tabeitha, anastethi]. With sublime
   faith like [Taleitha koum] of Jesus in Mr 5:41. She sat up
   [anekathisen]. Effective aorist active indicative of [anakathizO].
   Often in medical writers, only here in the N.T. and Lu 7:15 where
   Westcott and Hort have in the margin the uncompounded form [ekathisen].
   Vivid picture.

   9:41 Raised her up [anestesen auten]. First aorist active indicative,
   transitive, of [anistemi]. Presented [parestesen]. First aorist active
   indicative, transitive of [paristemi] (cf. intransitive second aorist
   in verse 39 above). It was a joyful time for Peter, the widows, all the
   saints, and for Dorcas.

   9:43 Many days [hemeras hikanas]. See on verse 23. Luke is fond of the
   phrase and uses it for time, number, size. It might be "ten days, ten
   months, or ten years" (Page). With one Simon a tanner [para tini SimOni
   bursei]. The use of [para] is usual for staying with one (by his side).
   "The more scrupulous Jews regarded such an occupation as unclean, and
   avoided those who pursued it. The conduct of Peter here shows that he
   did not carry his prejudices to that extent" (Hackett). One of the
   rabbis said: "It is impossible for the world to do without tanners; but
   woe to him who is a tanner." A Jewess could sue for divorce if she
   discovered that her husband was a tanner. And yet Peter will have
   scruples on the housetop in the tanner's house about eating food
   considered unclean. "The lodging with the tanner was a step on the road
   to eating with a Gentile" (Furneaux).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 10

   10:1 Cornelius [Kornelios]. The great Cornelian family of Rome may have
   had a freedman or descendant who is centurion [hekaton-tarches], leader
   of a hundred, Latin centurio). See on Mt 8:5. These Roman centurions
   always appear in a favourable light in the N.T. (Mt 8:5; Lu 7:2; 23:47;
   Ac 10:1; 22:25; 27:3). Furneaux notes the contrasts between Joppa, the
   oldest town in Palestine, and Caesarea, built by Herod; the Galilean
   fisherman lodging with a tanner and the Roman officer in the seat of
   governmental authority. Of the band called the Italian [ek speires tes
   kaloumenes Italikes]. A legion had ten cohorts or "bands" and sixty
   centuries. The word [speires] (note genitive in [-es] like the Ionic
   instead of [-as] is here equal to the Latin cohors. In the provinces
   were stationed cohorts of Italic citizens (volunteers) as an
   inscription at Carnuntum on the Danube (Ramsay) has shown (epitaph of
   an officer in the second Italic cohort). Once more Luke has been
   vindicated. The soldiers could, of course, be Roman citizens who lived
   in Caesarea. But the Italian cohorts were sent to any part of the
   empire as needed. The procurator at Caesarea would need a cohort whose
   loyalty he could trust, for the Jews were restless.

   10:2 Devout [eusebes]. Old word from [eu] (well) and [sebomai] (to
   worship, to reverence), but rare in the N.T. (Ac 10:2, 7; 2Pe 2:1). It
   might refer to a worshipful pagan (Ac 17:23, [sebasmata], objects of
   worship), but connected with "one that feared God" [phoboumenos ton
   theon] Luke describes "a God-fearing proselyte" as in 10:22, 35. This
   is his usual term for the Gentile seekers after God (13:16, 26; 17:4,
   17, etc.), who had come into the worship of the synagogue without
   circumcision, and were not strictly proselytes, though some call such
   men "proselytes of the gate" (cf. Ac 13:43); but clearly Cornelius and
   his family were still regarded as outside the pale of Judaism (10:28,
   34; 11:1, 8; 15:7). They had seats in the synagogue, but were not Jews.
   Gave much alms [poiOn eleemosunas pollas]. Doing many alms (the very
   phrase in Mt 6:2), a characteristic mark of Jewish piety and from a
   Gentile to the Jewish people. Prayed [deomenos]. Begging of God.
   Almsgiving and prayer were two of the cardinal points with the Jews
   (Jesus adds fasting in his picture of the Pharisee in Mt 6:1-18).

   10:3 Coming in [eiselthonta]. Ingressive second aorist active
   participle, not present. So punctiliar, "saw come," not "saw coming."
   So also "say" or "speak," not "saying." Luke repeats the account of
   this vision to Cornelius twice (10:30; 11:13) and also the story of the
   vision to Peter (10:1-16, 28; 11:5).

   10:4 Lord [kurie]. Cornelius recognizes the angel of God (verse 3) as
   God's messenger. Are gone up [anebesan]. Timeless second aorist active
   indicative of [anabainO]. Gone up like the smoke of incense in
   sacrifices. For a memorial [eis mnemosunon]. Old word from [mnemOn].
   The only other instance in the N.T. is by Jesus about the act of Mary
   of Bethany (Mt 26:13; Mr 14:9). His prayers and his alms proved his
   sincerity and won the ear of God.

   10:5 Fetch [metapempsai]. First aorist middle (indirect, for one's
   self) imperative of [metapempO], usual voice in ancient Greek with this
   verb in sense of sending another for one's own sake. Only in Acts in
   the N.T. See also 10:22.

   10:6 Lodgeth [xenizetai]. Present passive indicative of [xenizO] old
   verb from [xenos], a stranger as a guest. So to entertain a guest as
   here or to surprise by strange acts (Ac 17:20; 1Pe 4:4). Whose [hOi].
   To whom, dative of possession. By the seaside [para thalassan]. Along
   by the sea. Note accusative case. Outside the city walls because a
   tanner and to secure water for his trade. Some tanneries are by the
   seashore at Jaffa today.

   10:8 Rehearsed [exegesamenos]. See on Lu 24:35. All the details about
   the vision. The soldier was "devout" like Cornelius and would protect
   the two household servants [oiketOn].

   10:9 On the morrow [tei epaurion]. Locative case of article with the
   compound adverb [hemerai] day being understood), the second day after
   leaving Caesarea, 28 miles from Joppa. The third day (the next morrow,
   verse 23) they start back home and the fourth day (on the morrow again,
   verse 24) they reach Caesarea. As they [ekeinOn]. The party of three
   from Caesarea. Genitive absolute with present participle
   [hodoiporountOn] (journeying) and [eggizontOn] (drew nigh). The
   housetop [to dOma]. Old word and in Gospels (Lu 3:19, etc.), but only
   here in Acts. From [demO], to build, and so any part of the building
   (hall, dining room, and then roof). The roof was nearly flat with walls
   around and so was a good place for meditation and prayer and naps.

   10:10 Hungry [prospeinos] Only instance of the word known, a [hapax
   legomenon]. Probably "very hungry" [pros] = besides, in addition).
   Desired [ethelen]. Imperfect active. Was longing to eat. It was about
   twelve o'clock noon and Peter may even have smelt the savory dishes,
   "while they made ready" [paraskeuazontOn]. "The natural and the
   supernatural border closely on one another, with no definable limits"
   (Furneaux). He fell into a trance [egeneto ep' auton ekstasis]. More
   exactly, "An ecstasy came upon him," in which trance he passed out of
   himself [ekstasis], from [existemi] and from which one came to himself
   (12:11). Cf. also 11:5; 22:17. It is thus different from a vision
   [horama] as in verse 3.

   10:11 Beholdeth [theOrei]. Vivid historical present and change from
   past time. Opened [aneOigmenon], perfect passive participle with double
   reduplication, state of completion). Descending [katabainon]. Present
   active participle describing the process. Sheet [othonen]. Old word for
   linen cloth and only here in the N.T. Accusative case in apposition
   with [skeuos] (vessel). Let down [Kathiemenon]. Present passive
   participle of [Kathiemi]. Old verb, but in the N.T. only here and Lu
   5:19; Ac 9:25. Linear action here picturing the process, "being let
   down." By four corners [tessarsin archais]. Instrumental case of
   [arche], beginning. We say "end" or extremity for this use of the word.
   The picture is the sheet held up by four cords to which the sheet is
   fastened. Isa 11:12 had said that Israel would be gathered from the
   four corners of the earth. Knowling follows Hobart in taking the four
   corners of the sheet to be a medical phrase for bandage (the end of a
   bandage).

   10:12 Were [huperchen]. Imperfect of [huparchO] in sense of [en], to
   exist, be. Fish are not mentioned, perhaps because the sheet had no
   water, though they were clean and unclean also (Le 11:9; De 14:9). All
   manner of [panta]. Literally, all, but clearly all varieties, not all
   individuals. Both clean and unclean animals are in the sheet.

   10:14 Not so, Lord [MedamOs, kurie]. The negative [medamOs] calls for
   the optative [eie] (may it not be) or the imperative [estO] (let it
   be). It is not [oudamOs], a blunt refusal (I shall not do it). And yet
   it is more than a mild protest as Page and Furneaux argue. It is a
   polite refusal with a reason given. Peter recognizes the invitation to
   slay [thuson] the unclean animals as from the Lord [kurie] but declines
   it three times. For I have never eaten anything [hoti oudepote ephagon
   pan]. Second aorist active indicative, I never did anything like this
   and I shall not do it now. The use of [pan] (everything) with
   [oudepote] (never) is like the Hebrew (lo--kOl) though a like idiom
   appears in the vernacular Koine (Robertson, Grammar, p. 752). Common
   and unclean [koinon kai akatharton]. [Koinos] from epic [xunos] [xun,
   sun], together with) originally meant common to several (Latin
   communis) as in Ac 2:44; 4:32; Tit 1:4; Jude 1:3. The use seen here
   (also Mr 7:2, 5; Ro 14:14; Heb 10:29; Re 21:27; Ac 10:28; 11:8), like
   Latin vulgaris is unknown in ancient Greek. Here the idea is made plain
   by the addition of [akatharton] (unclean), ceremonially unclean, of
   course. We have the same double use in our word "common." See on Mr
   7:18f. where Mark adds the remarkable participle [katharizOn] (making
   all meats clean), evidently from Peter who recalls this vision. Peter
   had been reared from childhood to make the distinction between clean
   and unclean food and this new proposal even from the Lord runs against
   all his previous training. He did not see that some of God's plans for
   the Jews could be temporary. This symbol of the sheet was to show Peter
   ultimately that Gentiles could be saved without becoming Jews. At this
   moment he is in spiritual and intellectual turmoil.

   10:15 Make not thou common [su me koinou]. Note emphatic position of
   [su] (thou). Do thou stop making common what God cleansed
   [ekatharisen]. The idiom of [me] with the present active imperative
   [koinou] means precisely this. Peter had just called "common" what God
   had invited him to slay and eat.

   10:16 Thrice [epitris]. For three times. Peter remained unconvinced
   even by the prohibition of God. Here is a striking illustration of
   obstinacy on the part of one who acknowledges the voice of God to him
   when the command of the Lord crosses one's preferences and prejudices.
   There are abundant examples today of precisely this thing. In a real
   sense Peter was maintaining a pose of piety beyond the will of the
   Lord. Peter was defiling what God had cleansed. Was received up
   [anelemphthe]. First aorist passive indicative of [analambanO], to take
   up. The word used of the Ascension (1:22).

   10:17 Was much perplexed in himself [en heautOi dieporei]. Imperfect
   active of [diaporeO], intensive compound [dia], thoroughly, and [a]
   privative and [poros], way), to be completely at a loss to know what
   road to take. Old verb, but in N.T. only in Luke and Acts. Page notes
   that Luke is singularly fond of verbs compounded with [dia]. See on Lu
   9:7 and Ac 2:12. When out of the ecstasy he was more puzzled than ever.
   Might be [an eie]. Optative with [an] in indirect question simply
   retained from the direct (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1021, 1044). See Ac
   17:18, for the direct and Lu 1:62 for the indirect [an theloi] both
   times). It is the conclusion of a fourth class condition. Having made
   inquiry [dierOtesantes]. First aorist active participle of [dierOtaO],
   another compound of [dia], to ask one after another, to ask through,
   old verb, but only here in the N.T. It took diligent inquiry to find
   the obscure house of Simon the tanner. Stood before the gate [epestesan
   epi ton pulOna]. Second aorist active indicative of [ephistemi],
   intransitive. Note repetition of [epi]. The messengers stopped right at
   the folding gates of the passage [pulOna] which led from the street to
   the inner court or house.

   10:18 Called [phOnesantes]. In a loud voice that those inside the house
   might hear. Asked [epunthanonto]. Imperfect middle of [punthanomai],
   old verb to make inquiry especially with an indirect question as here.
   Kept on inquiring. Westcott and Hort follow B C here and read
   [eputhonto] (second aorist middle, effective aorist). Either makes
   sense, though the imperfect is more picturesque. Were lodging
   [xenizetai]. Present middle indicative retained in indirect question.
   See on verse 6 for the verb.

   10:19 Thought [dienthumoumenou]. Genitive absolute of present middle
   participle of [dienthumeomai], a double compound [dia] and [en-] with
   [thumos] and another [hapax legomenon] save in ecclesiastical writers,
   though [enthumeomai] is common enough and Textus Receptus so reads
   here. Peter was revolving in his mind, through and through, in and out,
   to find the meaning of the strange vision.

   10:20 But [alla]. So usually, though it is open to question whether
   [alla] is adversative here and not rather, "Now then." Get thee down
   [katabethi]. Second aorist active imperative, at once. Go [poreuou].
   Present middle imperative, go on. Nothing doubting [meden
   diakrinomenos]. Another compound of [dia], old and common verb for a
   divided mind [dia] like [duo], two). Note usual negative of the present
   middle participle, the subjective [meden]. The notion of wavering (Jas
   1:6) is common with this verb in the middle voice. In Ac 11:12 the
   aorist active [meden diakrinanta] is used perhaps with the idea of
   conduct towards others rather than his own internal doubt as here
   (Page). For I [hoti egO]. The Holy Spirit assumes responsibility for
   the messengers from Cornelius and thus connects their mission with the
   vision which was still troubling Peter. Peter had heard his name called
   by the man (verse 19).

   10:21 Cause [aitia]. Or reason. Common in this sense. See on Mt 19:3.

   10:22 Righteous [dikaios]. In the Jewish sense as in Lu 1:6; 2:25. Well
   reported of [marturoumenos]. Present passive participle as in 6:3. Cf.
   the other centurion in Lu 7:4. Nation [ethnous]. Not [laou], for the
   speakers are Gentiles. Was warned [echrematisthe]. First aorist passive
   of [chrematizO], old word for doing business, then consulting an
   oracle, and here of being divinely (word God not expressed) warned as
   in Mt 2:12, 22; Lu 2:26; Heb 11:7. Then to be called or receive a name
   from one's business as in Ac 11:26; Ro 7:3.

   10:23 Lodged them [exenisen]. Active voice here rather than passive as
   in 10:6. Accompanied him [sunelthan autOi]. Associative instrumental
   case after verb. The wisdom of having these half dozen Jewish
   Christians from Joppa with Peter in the house of Cornelius in Caesarea
   becomes manifest in Jerusalem (11:12).

   10:24 Was waiting [en prosdokOn]. Periphrastic imperfect active, in
   eager expectation and hope, directing the mind [dokaO] towards [pros]
   anything. Old and common verb. Near [anagkaious]. Only instance in the
   N.T. of this sense of [anagkaios] from [anagke], necessity, what one
   cannot do without, necessary (1Co 12:22), duty (Ac 13:46), or blood
   relations as here. The ancient Greek writers combined these two words
   [suggeneis], kinsmen, [anagkaious], necessary friends) as here. It was
   a homogeneous group of Gentiles close to Cornelius and predisposed to
   hear Peter favourably.

   10:25 That Peter entered [tou eiselthein ton Petron]. This is a
   difficult construction, for the subject of [egeneto] (it happened) has
   to be the articular genitive infinitive [tou eiselthein] with the
   accusative of general reference [ton Petron]. Most commentators
   consider it inexplicable. It is probably an extension of the ordinary
   articular infinitive under the influence of the Hebrew infinitive
   construct without regard to the case, regarding it as a fixed case form
   and so using it as nominative. Precisely this construction of [tou] and
   the infinitive as the subject of a verb occurs in the LXX (2Ch 6:7,
   etc.). See Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1067f. for full discussion of this
   obvious Hebraism. Somewhat similar examples appear in Ac 20:3; 27:1.
   But the Codex Bezae avoids this awkward idiom by the genitive absolute
   [proseggizontos tou Petrou] and some additional details (one of the
   servants ran forward and announced that he was come). Worshipped him
   [prosekunesen]. "Cornelius was not an idolator and would not have
   honoured Peter as a god" (Furneaux). The word probably means here
   reverence like old English usage (Wycliff) and not actual worship,
   though Peter took it that way (verse 26). Jesus accepted such worship
   (Mt 8:2; Lu 5:8 by Peter).

   10:27 As he talked with him [sunomilOn autOi]. Present active
   participle of [sunomileO], rare compound and here alone in the N.T.,
   with associative instrumental case. The uncompounded verb is common
   enough though in the N.T. only in Lu 24:14 which see and Ac 20:11;
   24:26. Findeth [heuriskei]. Vivid historical present indicative active.
   Come together [suneleluthotas]. Second perfect active participle of
   [sunerchomai]. It was an expectant group of Gentiles eager for Peter's
   interpretation of the vision of Cornelius.

   10:28 How that it is an unlawful thing [hOs athemiton estin]. The
   conjunction [hOs] is sometimes equivalent to [hoti] (that). The old
   form of [athemitos] was [athemistos] from [themisto] [themizO, themis],
   law custom) and [a] privative. In the N.T. only here and 1Pe 4:3 (Peter
   both times). But there is no O.T. regulation forbidding such social
   contact with Gentiles, though the rabbis had added it and had made it
   binding by custom. There is nothing more binding on the average person
   than social custom. On coming from the market an orthodox Jew was
   expected to immerse to avoid defilement (Edersheim, Jewish Social Life,
   pp. 26-28; Taylor's Sayings of the Jewish Fathers, pp. 15, 26, 137,
   second edition). See also Ac 11:3; Ga 2:12. It is that middle wall of
   partition between Jew and Gentile (Eph 2:14) which Jesus broke down.
   One of another nation [allophulOi]. Dative case of an old adjective,
   but only here in the N.T. [allos], another, [phulon], race). Both
   Juvenal (Sat. XIV. 104, 105) and Tacitus (History, V. 5) speak of the
   Jewish exclusiveness and separation from Gentiles. And yet unto
   [kamoi]. Dative of the emphatic pronoun (note position of prominence)
   with [kai] [crasis] meaning here "and yet" or adversative "but" as
   often with [kai] which is by no means always merely the connective
   "and" (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1182f.). Now Peter takes back both the
   adjectives used in his protest to the Lord (verse 14) "common and
   unclean." It is a long journey that Peter has made. He here refers to
   "no one" [medena], not to "things," but that is great progress.

   10:29 Without gainsaying [anantirrhetOs]. [A] privative with compound
   adverb from [anti] (back, in return, against) and verbal [rhetos] (from
   [errhethen], to speak). Late and rare and here only in the N.T., but
   the adjective in 19:36. Without answering back. That is true after the
   Holy Spirit expressly told Peter to go with the messengers of Cornelius
   (10:19-23). Peter's objections were made to the Lord in the vision
   which he did not understand. But that vision prepared him for this
   great step which he had now taken. He had stepped over the line of
   Jewish custom. With what intent [tini logOi]. More exactly, "for what
   reason" as in Plato, Gorgias 512 C.

   10:30 Four days ago [apo tetartes hemeras]. From the fourth day,
   reckoning backwards from this day. I was keeping the ninth hour of
   prayer [emen ten enaten proseuchomenos]. Periphrastic middle imperfect
   and accusative of extension of time (all the ninth hour).

   10:31 Is heard [eisekousthe]. Sort of timeless first aorist passive
   indicative as is "are had in remembrance" [emnesthesan]. See verse 4
   "are gone up for a memorial").

   10:32 In the house of Simon [en oikiai SimOnos]. See 9:43 for [para
   SimOni] with same idea.

   10:33 And thou hast well done that thou art come [su te kalOs epoiesas
   paragenomenos]. "And thou didst well in coming." A regular formula for
   expressing thanks as in Php 4:14; 3Jo 1:6; 2Pe 1:19. The participle
   completes the idea of [kalOs poieO] neatly. Cornelius commends Peter
   for his courage in breaking away from Jewish custom and takes no
   offence at the implied superiority of the Jews over the Gentiles.
   Cornelius and his circle of kinsmen and close friends are prepared soil
   for a new era in the history of Christianity. The Samaritans were now
   nominal Jews and the Ethiopian eunuch was a single case, but here Peter
   the chief apostle, not Philip the preaching deacon (evangelist), was
   involved. It was a crisis. Cornelius reveals an open mind for the
   message of God through Peter. Commanded thee [prostetagmena soi].
   Perfect passive participle with the dative case [soi]. Cornelius is a
   military man and he employs a military term [prostassO], old word to
   command). He is ready for orders from the Lord.

   10:34 Opened his mouth [anoixas to stoma]. Solemn formula for beginning
   his address (8:35; 18:14; Mt 5:2; 13:35). But also good elocution for
   the speaker. I perceive [katalambanomai]. Aoristic present middle of
   [katalambanO], to take hold of, the middle noting mental action, to lay
   hold with the mind (Ac 4:13; 10:34; 25:25; Eph 3:18). It had been a
   difficult thing for Peter to grasp, but now "of a truth" [ep'
   aletheias] the light has cleared away the fogs. It was not until Peter
   had crossed the threshold of the house of Cornelius in the new
   environment and standpoint that he sees this new and great truth.
   Respecter of persons [prosOpolemptes]. This compound occurs only here
   and in Chrysostom. It is composed of [prosOpon] face or person [pros]
   and [ops], before the eye or face) and [lambanO]. The abstract form
   [prosOpolempsia] occurs in Jas 2:1 (also Ro 2:11; Eph 6:9; Col 3:25)
   and the verb [prosOpolempteO] in Jas 2:9. The separate phrase
   [lambanein prosOpon] occurs in Lu 20:21; Ga 2:6. The phrase was already
   in the LXX (De 10:17; 2Ch 19:7; Ps 82:6). Luke has simply combined the
   two words into one compound one. The idea is to pay regard to one's
   looks or circumstances rather than to his intrinsic character. The Jews
   had come to feel that they were the favourites of God and actually sons
   of the kingdom of heaven because they were descendants of Abraham. John
   the Baptist rebuked them for this fallacy.

   10:35 Acceptable to him [dektos autOi]. Verbal adjective from
   [dechomai]. Acceptabilis. That is to say, a Gentile would not have to
   become a Jew in order to become a Christian. Evidently Peter had not
   before perceived this fact. On the great Day of Pentecost when he spoke
   of the promise "to all those afar off" (2:39) Peter understood that
   they must first become Jews and then Christians. The new idea that now
   makes a revolution in Peter's outlook is precisely this that Christ can
   and will save Gentiles like this Cornelius group without their becoming
   Jews at all.

   10:36 The word which he sent [ton logon hon apesteilen]. Many ancient
   MSS. (so Westcott and Hort) read merely [ton logon apesteilen] (he sent
   the word). This reading avoids the anacoluthon and inverse attraction
   of [logon] to the case of the relative [hon] (which). Preaching good
   tidings of peace through Jesus Christ [euaggelizomenos eirenen dia
   Iesou Christou]. Gospelizing peace through Jesus Christ. There is no
   other way to have real peace between individuals and God, between races
   and nations, than by Jesus Christ. Almost this very language occurs in
   Eph 2:17 where Paul states that Jesus on the cross "preached
   (gospelized) peace to you who are afar off and peace to you who are
   near." Peter here sees what Paul will see later with great clearness.
   He is Lord of all [houtos estin pantOn kurios]. A triumphant
   parenthesis that Peter throws in as the reason for his new truth. Jesus
   Christ is Lord of all, both Jews and Gentiles.

   10:37 Ye know [humeis oidate]. Peter reminds his Gentile audience that
   the main facts concerning Jesus and the gospel were known to them. Note
   emphatic expression of [humeis] (you). Beginning [arxamenos]. The
   Textus Receptus has [arxamenon] (accusative), but the nominative is
   given by Aleph A B C D E H and is certainly correct. But it makes a
   decided anacoluthon. The accusative would agree with [rhema] used in
   the sense of message or story as told by the disciples. The nominative
   does not agree with anything in the sentence. The same phrase occurs in
   Lu 23:5. Here is this aorist middle participle almost used like an
   adverb. See a similar loose use of [arxamenos] in the same sense by
   Peter in Ac 1:22. The baptism of John is given as the terminus a quo.
   The story began with a skip to Galilee after the baptism just like the
   Gospel of Mark. This first message of Peter to the Gentiles (10:37-44)
   corresponds in broad outline with Mark's Gospel. Mark heard Peter
   preach many times and evidently planned his Gospel (the Roman Gospel)
   on this same model. There is in it nothing about the birth and
   childhood of Jesus nor about the intervening ministry supplied by
   John's Gospel for the period (a year) between the baptism and the
   Galilean Ministry. Peter here presents an objective statement of the
   life, death, and resurrection of Jesus with proof from the Scriptures
   that he is the Messiah. It is a skilful presentation.

   10:38 Jesus of Nazareth [Iesoun ton apo Nazareth]. Jesus the one from
   Nazareth, the article before the city identifying him clearly. The
   accusative case is here by [prolepsis], Jesus being expressed for
   emphasis before the verb "anointed" and the pronoun repeated
   pleonastically after it. "Jesus transfers the mind from the
   gospel-history to the personal subject of it" (Hackett). God anointed
   him [echrisen, auton, ho theos]. First aorist active of the verb
   [chriO], to anoint, from which the verbal [Christos] is formed (Ac
   2:36). The precise event referred to by Peter could be the Incarnation
   (Lu 1:35f.), the Baptism (Lu 3:22), the Ministry at Nazareth (Lu 4:14).
   Why not to the life and work of Jesus as a whole? Went about doing good
   [dielthen euergetOn]. Beautiful description of Jesus. Summary
   (constative) aorist active of [dierehomai], to go through [dia] or from
   place to place. The present active participle [euergetOn] is from the
   old verb [euergeteO] [eu], well, [ergon], work) and occurs only here in
   the N.T. The substantive [euergetes] (benefactor) was often applied to
   kings like Ptolemy Euergetes and that is the sense in Lu 22:25 the only
   N.T. example. But the term applies to Jesus far more than to Ptolemy or
   any earthly king (Cornelius a Lapide). And healing [kai iOmenos]. And
   in particular healing. Luke does not exclude other diseases (cf. Lu
   13:11,16), but he lays special emphasis on demoniacal possession (cf.
   Mr 1:23). That were oppressed [tous katadunasteuomenous]. Present
   passive articular participle of [katadunasteuO]. A late verb in LXX and
   papyri. In the N.T. only here and Jas 2:6 (best MSS.). One of the
   compounds of [kata] made transitive. The reality of the devil (the
   slanderer, [diabolos] is recognized by Peter. For God was with him
   [hoti ho theos en met' autou]. Surely this reason does not reveal "a
   low Christology" as some charge. Peter had used the same language in Ac
   7:9 and earlier in Lu 1:28, 66 as Nicodemus does in Joh 3:2.

   10:39 And we are witnesses [kai hemeis martures]. Compare "ye
   yourselves know" (verse 37). Peter thus appeals to what the audience
   know and to what the disciples know. He made the same claim about
   personal witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus at Pentecost (2:32).
   Here Peter affirms full knowledge of the work of Jesus in Judea (for
   whole country including Galilee and Perea) and Jerusalem (given mainly
   in John's Gospel). In the Greek [hOn] (which) is attracted into the
   genitive case to agree with the antecedent [pantOn] (all), a common
   enough idiom. Whom also they slew [hon kai aneilan]. Second aorist
   active indicative of [anaireO] with [a] as often in Acts (2:23; 5:30).
   But note [kai] (also) in the old MSS., not in the Textus Receptus. They
   "also" slew him, went that far, "this crowning atrocity" (Vincent),
   [kai] could here be "even." Hanging him on a tree [kremasantes epi
   xulou]. This same expression used by Peter in 5:30 which see for
   discussion.

   10:40 Gave him to be made manifest [edOken auton emphane genesthai].
   Peculiar phrase, here only in the N.T. and in Ro 10:20 (quoted from Isa
   65:1). [Emphane], predicate accusative after infinitive [genesthai]
   agreeing with [auton] object of [edOken].

   10:41 Chosen before [prokecheirotonemenois]. Perfect passive participle
   dative plural from [procheirotoneO], to choose or designate by hand
   [cheirotoneO, cheir], hand, and [teinO], to stretch, as in Ac 14:23;
   2Co 8:19), beforehand [pro], a double compound as old as Plato, but
   here alone in the N.T. Peter is evidently stating the thing as it
   happened and not trying to make a convincing story by saying that both
   friends and foes saw him after his resurrection. It is the "historian's
   candour" (Paley) in Luke here that adds to the credibility of the
   narrative. The sceptical Jews would not have believed and Jesus was
   kept from open contact with the world of sin after his Passion. To us
   who did eat and drink with him [hemin hoitines sunephagomen kai
   sunepiomen autOi]. The "who" [hoitines] is first person agreeing with
   "us" [hemin]. Second aorist active indicative of the common verbs
   [sunesthiO] and [sumpinO]. [AutOi] is associative instrumental case.
   There are difficulties to us in understanding how Jesus could eat and
   drink after the resurrection as told here and in Lu 24:41-3, but at any
   rate Peter makes it clear that it was no hallucination or ghost, but
   Jesus himself whom they saw after he rose from the dead, "after the
   rising as to him" [meta to anastenai auton], [meta] with the accusative
   articular infinitive second aorist active and the accusative [auton] of
   general reference). Furneaux dares to think that the disciples
   misunderstood Jesus about eating after the resurrection. But that is to
   deny the testimony merely because we cannot explain the transition
   state of the body of Jesus.

   10:42 He charged [pareggeilen]. First aorist active indicative as in
   1:4. There Jesus is the subject and so probably here, though Page
   insists that [ho theos] (God) is here because of verse 40. To testify
   [diamarturasthai]. First aorist middle infinitive. See on 2:40.
   Ordained [hOrismenos]. Perfect passive participle of [horizO], old
   verb, to mark out, to limit, to make a horizon. Judge [krites]. The
   same point made by Peter in 1Pe 4:5. He does not use the word "Messiah"
   to these Gentiles though he did say "anointed" [echrisen] in verse 38.
   Peter's claim for Jesus is that he is the Judge of Jew and Gentile
   (living and dead).

   10:43 Every one that believeth [panta ton pisteuonta]. This accusative
   active participle of general reference with the infinitive in indirect
   discourse is the usual idiom. Only [labein] (second aorist active
   infinitive of [lambanO] is not indirect statement so much as indirect
   command or arrangement. The prophets bear witness to Jesus Christ to
   this effect. It is God's plan and no race distinctions are drawn. Peter
   had already said the same thing at Pentecost (2:38), but now he sees
   himself that Gentiles do not have to become Jews, but have only to
   believe in Jesus as Messiah and Judge as foretold by the prophets. It
   was glorious news to Cornelius and his group. Through his name [dia tou
   onomatos autou], not as a title or magic formula (Ac 18:13), but the
   power of Christ himself represented by his name.

   10:44 While Peter yet spake [eti lalountos tou Petrou]. Genitive
   absolute of present participle, still going on. The Holy Ghost fell
   [epepesen to pneuma to hagion]. Second aorist active indicative of
   [epipiptO], old verb to fall upon, to recline, to come upon. Used of
   the Holy Spirit in 8:16; 10:44; 11:15. It appears that Peter was
   interrupted in his sermon by this remarkable event. The Jews had
   received the Holy Spirit (2:4), the Samaritans (8:17), and now
   Gentiles. But on this occasion it was before baptism, as was apparently
   true in Paul's case (9:17f.). In 8:16; 19:5 the hands of the apostles
   were also placed after baptism on those who received the Holy Spirit.
   Here it was unexpected by Peter and by Cornelius and was indubitable
   proof of the conversion of these Gentiles who had accepted Peter's
   message and had believed on Jesus Christ as Saviour.

   10:45 They of the circumcision which believed [hoi ek peritomes
   pistoi]. The believing ones of the circumcision, more exactly. Were
   amazed [exestesan]. Second aorist active indicative, intransitive, of
   [existemi]. They stood out of themselves. On the Gentiles also [kai epi
   ta ethne]. Or, even upon the Gentiles. Was poured out [ekkechutai].
   Present perfect passive retained in indirect discourse of [ekcheO] or
   [ekchunO], old verb, used metaphorically of the Holy Spirit also in
   2:17 (from Joe 2:28f.), Ac 2:33.

   10:46 They heard [ekouon]. Imperfect active, were hearing, kept on
   hearing. Speak [lalountOn]. Present active participle, speaking, for
   they kept it up. With tongues [glOssais]. Instrumental case as in 2:4,
   11 which see. The fuller statement there makes it clear that here it
   was new and strange tongues also as in 19:6; 1Co 14:4-19. This sudden
   manifestation of the Holy Spirit's power on uncircumcised Gentiles was
   probably necessary to convince Peter and the six brethren of the
   circumcision that God had opened the door wide to Gentiles. It was
   proof that a Gentile Pentecost had come and Peter used it effectively
   in his defence in Jerusalem (Ac 11:15).

   10:47 Can any man forbid the water? [Meti to hudOr dunatai kOl-sai
   tis?]. The negative [meti] expects the answer No. The evidence was
   indisputable that these Gentiles were converted and so were entitled to
   be baptized. See the similar idiom in Lu 6:39. Note the article with
   "water." Here the baptism of the Holy Spirit had preceded the baptism
   of water (Ac 1:5; 11:16). "The greater had been bestowed; could the
   lesser be withheld?" (Knowling). That these should not be baptized [tou
   me baptisthenai toutous]. Ablative case of the articular first aorist
   passive infinitive of [baptizO] with the redundant negative after the
   verb of hindering [kOl-sai] and the accusative of general reference
   [toutous]. The redundant negative after the verb of hindering is not
   necessary though often used in ancient Greek and in the Koine (papyri).
   Without it see Mt 19:14; Ac 8:36 and with it see Lu 4:42; 24:16; Ac
   14:18. Cf. Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1061, 1094, 1171. The triple
   negatives here are a bit confusing to the modern mind [meti] in the
   question, [kOl-sai], to hinder or to cut off, [me] with [baptisthenai].
   Literally, Can any one cut off the water from the being baptized as to
   these? Meyer: "The water is in this animated language conceived as the
   element offering itself for the baptism." As well as we [hOs kai
   hemeis]. The argument was conclusive. God had spoken. Note the query of
   the eunuch to Philip (Ac 8:36).

   10:48 Commanded [prosetaxen]. First aorist active indicative. Peter
   himself abstained from baptizing on this occasion (cf. Paul in 1Co
   1:14). Evidently it was done by the six Jewish brethren. Them to be
   baptized [autous baptisthenai]. Accusative of general reference with
   the first aorist passive infinitive. In the name of Jesus Christ [en
   tOi onomati Iesou Christou]. The essential name in Christian baptism as
   in 2:38; 19:5. But these passages give the authority for the act, not
   the formula that was employed (Alvah Hovey in Hackett's Commentary. See
   also chapter on the Baptismal Formula in my The Christ of the Logia).
   "Golden days" [aurei dies], Bengel) were these for the whole group.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 11

   11:1 In Judea [kata ten Ioudaian]. Throughout Judea (probably all
   Palestine), distributive use of [kata]. The news from Casearea spread
   like wildfire among the Jewish Christians. The case of the Samaritans
   was different, for they were half Jews, though disliked. But here were
   real Romans even if with Jewish affinities. Had received [edexanto].
   First aorist middle indicative. The English idiom requires "had"
   received, the Greek has simply "received."

   11:2 They that were of the circumcision [hoi ek peritomes]. Literally,
   those of circumcision (on the side of circumcision, of the circumcision
   party). The phrase in 10:46 is confined to the six brethren with Peter
   in Caesarea (11:12). That can hardly be the meaning here for it would
   mean that they were the ones who brought the charge against Peter
   though Hort takes this view. All the disciples in Jerusalem were Jews
   so that it can hardly mean the whole body. In Ga 2:12 the phrase has
   the narrower sense of the Judaizing or Pharisaic wing of the disciples
   (Ac 15:5) who made circumcision necessary for all Gentile converts.
   Probably here by anticipation Luke so describes the beginning of that
   great controversy. The objectors probably did not know of Peter's
   vision at Joppa, but only of the revolutionary conduct of Peter in
   Caesarea. These extremists who spoke probably had abundant sympathy in
   their protest. The apostles are mentioned in verse 1, but are not
   referred to in verse 2. Apparently they are in contrast with the
   circumcision party in the church. Contended [diekrinonto]. Imperfect
   middle of the common verb [diakrinO], to separate. Here to separate
   oneself apart [dia], to take sides against, to make a cleavage [dia],
   two, in two) as in Jude 1:9. So Peter is at once put on the defensive
   as the contention went on. It is plain that Peter was not regarded as
   any kind of pope or overlord.

   11:3 Thou wentest in [eiselthes]. Direct form, but Westcott and Hort
   have it [eiselthen] (he went in), indirect form. So with [sunephages]
   (didst eat) and [sunephagen] (did eat). The direct is more vivid. Men
   uncircumcised [andras akrobustian echontas]. "Men having
   uncircumcision." It is a contemptuous expression. They did not object
   to Peter's preaching to the Gentiles, but to his going into the house
   of Cornelius and eating with them, violating his supposed obligations
   as a Jew (Hackett). It was the same complaint in principle that the
   Pharisees had made against Jesus when he ate with publicans and sinners
   (Lu 15:12). The Jews had not merely the Mosaic regulations about clean
   and unclean food, but also the fact that at a Gentile table some of the
   meat may have been an idol sacrifice. And Peter himself had similar
   scruples when the vision came to him at Joppa and when he entered the
   house of Cornelius in Caesarea 10:28). Peter had been led beyond the
   circumcision party.

   11:4 Began [arxamenos]. Not pleonastic here, but graphically showing
   how Peter began at the beginning and gave the full story of God's
   dealings with him in Joppa and Caesarea. Expounded [exetitheto].
   Imperfect middle of [ektithemi], to set forth, old verb, but in the
   N.T. only in Acts (7:21; 11:4; 18:26; 28:23), a deliberate and detailed
   narrative "in order" [kathexes]. Old word for in succession. In the
   N.T. only in Lu 1:2; 8:1; Ac 3:24; 11:14; 18:23. Luke evidently
   considered this defence of Peter important and he preserves the marks
   of authenticity. It came originally from Peter himself (verses 5, 6,
   15, 16). "The case of Cornelius was a test case of primary importance"
   (Page), "the first great difficulty of the early Church." Part of the
   story Luke gives three times (10:3-6,30-32; 11:13f.). See the
   discussion chapter 10 for details given here.

   11:5 Let down [kathiemenen]. Here agreeing with the "sheet" [othonen],
   feminine), not with "vessel" [skeuos], neuter) as in 10:11. Even unto
   me [achri emou]. Vivid detail added here by Peter.

   11:6 When I had fastened my eyes [atenisas]. This personal touch Peter
   adds from his own experience. See on Lu 4:20; Ac 3:4, 12 for this
   striking verb [atenizO], to stretch the eyes towards, first aorist
   active participle here. I considered [katanoeO]. Imperfect active of
   [kataneoO] to put the mind down on, to ponder, I was pondering. And saw
   [kai eidon]. Second aorist active indicative, saw in a flash.

   11:7 A voice saying [phOnes legouses]. Genitive case after [ekousa]
   (cf. 9:7 and accusative 9:4 which see for discussion). Participle
   [legouses] (present active of [legO] agreeing with [phOnes], a kind of
   indirect discourse use of the participle.

   11:8 Came into my mouth [eiselthen eis to stoma mou]. Instead of
   [ephagon] (I ate) in 10:14. Different phrase for the same idea.

   11:10 Was drawn up [anespasthe]. Instead of [anelempthe] (was taken up)
   in 10:16. First aorist passive indicative of [anaspaO], old verb, but
   in N.T. only in Lu 14:5 and here.

   11:12 Making no distinction [meden diakrinanta]. So Westcott and Hort
   (first aorist active participle) instead of [meden diakrinomenon]
   "nothing doubting" (present middle participle) like 10:20. The
   difference in voice shows the distinction in meaning. We entered into
   the man's house [eiselthomen eis ton oikon tou andros]. Peter confesses
   it, but shows that the other six went in also. He avoids mention of
   Cornelius's name and office.

   11:13 Standing and saying [stathenta kai eiponta]. More precisely,
   "stand and say" (punctiliar act, first aorist passive and second aorist
   active participles). Fetch Simon [metapempsai SimOna]. First aorist
   middle imperative. Third time mentioned (10:5, 22; 11:13). Perhaps
   Peter is anxious to make it plain that he did not go of his own
   initiative into the house of Cornelius. He went under God's direct
   orders.

   11:14 Whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house [en hois
   sOthesei su kai pas ho oikos sou]. Future passive indicative of [sOzO],
   to save. Clearly Cornelius was unsaved in spite of his interest in
   Jewish worship. Clearly also the household of Cornelius would likewise
   be won to Christ by the words of Simon Peter. This is household
   conversion before the household baptism (10:48; 11:17).

   11:15 As I began to speak [en tOi arxasthai me lalein]. [En] with the
   locative of the articular aorist infinitive [arxasthai] (punctiliar
   action simply) and the accusative of general reference. The second
   infinitive [lalein] (to speak) is dependent on [arxasthai], "In the
   beginning to speak as to me." Even as on us at the beginning [hOsper
   kai eph' hemas en archei]. Peter recalls vividly the events at
   Pentecost, the speaking with tongues and all. It is noteworthy that
   Peter does not here repeat his sermon. "He rests his defence, not on
   what he said, but on what God did" (Furneaux).

   11:16 I remembered [emnesthen]. First aorist passive indicative of the
   common verb [mimneskO], to remind. Peter recalls the very words of
   Jesus as reported in Ac 1:5. Peter now understands this saying of Jesus
   as he had not done before. That is a common experience with us all as
   new experiences of grace open richer veins in God's truth (Joh 12:16).
   Peter clearly sees that the water baptism is merely the symbol or
   picture of the spiritual baptism in the heart.

   11:17 The like gift [ten isen dOrean]. The equal gift, equal in
   quality, rank, or measure. Common word. When we believed [pisteusasin].
   First aorist active participle of [pisteuO] in the dative case. It
   agrees both with [hemin] (unto us) and with [autois] (unto them),
   "having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ." Both classes (Gentiles and
   Jews) trusted in Christ, and both received the Holy Spirit. Who was I
   [egO tis emen]. Note order, "I, who was I." "That I could withstand
   God" [dunatos kOl-sai ton theon]. Literally, "able to withstand or
   hinder God." It is a rhetorical question, really two questions. Who was
   I ? Was I able to hinder God? Peter's statement of the facts made an
   unanswerable defence. And yet Peter (Ga 2:11) will later in Antioch
   play the coward before emissaries from Jerusalem on this very point of
   eating with Gentile Christians.

   11:18 Held their peace [hesuchasan]. Ingressive aorist active
   indicative of [hesuchazO], old verb to be quiet, to keep quiet. The
   wrangling (verse 2) ceased. The critics even "glorified God"
   [edoxasan], ingressive aorist again). Then to the Gentiles also [Ara
   kai tois ethnesin]. [Ergo] as in Lu 11:20, 48 and like [ara oun] in Ro
   5:18. In ancient Greek inferential [ara] cannot come at the beginning
   of a clause as here. It was reluctant acquiescence in the undoubted
   fact that God had "granted repentance unto life" to these Gentiles in
   Caesarea, but the circumcision party undoubtedly looked on it as an
   exceptional case and not to be regarded as a precedent to follow with
   other Gentiles. Peter will see in this incident (Ac 15:8) the same
   principle for which Paul contends at the Jerusalem Conference. Furneaux
   suggests that this conduct of Peter in Caesarea, though grudgingly
   acquiesced in after his skilful defence, decreased his influence in
   Jerusalem where he had been leader and helped open the way for the
   leadership of James the Lord's brother.

   11:19 They therefore that were scattered abroad [hoi men oun
   diasparentes]. Precisely the same words used in 8:4 about those
   scattered by Saul (which see) and a direct reference to it is made by
   the next words, "upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen" [apo
   tes thlipseOs tes genomenes epi StephanOi]. As a result of [apo], in
   the case of [epi] Stephen. From that event Luke followed Saul through
   his conversion and back to Jerusalem and to Tarsus. Then he showed the
   activity of Peter outside of Jerusalem as a result of the cessation of
   the persecution from the conversion of Saul with the Gentile Pentecost
   in Caesarea and the outcome in Jerusalem. Now Luke starts over again
   from the same persecution by Saul and runs a new line of events up to
   Antioch parallel to the other, probably partly following. Except to
   Jews only [ei me monon Ioudaiois]. Clearly these disciples did not know
   anything about the events in Caesarea and at first their flight
   preceded that time. But it was a wonderful episode, the eager and loyal
   preaching of the fleeing disciples. The culmination in Antioch was
   probably after the report of Peter about Caesarea. This Antioch by the
   Orontes was founded 300 B.C. by Seleucus Nicator and was one of five
   cities so named by the Seleucides. It became the metropolis of Syria
   though the Arabs held Damascus first. Antioch ranked next to Rome and
   Alexandria in size, wealth, power, and vice. There were many Jews in
   the cosmopolitan population of half a million. It was destined to
   supplant Jerusalem as the centre of Christian activity.

   11:20 Spake [elaloun]. Inchoative imperfect active, began to speak. For
   them it was an experiment. Unto the Greeks also [kai pros tous
   Hellenas]. This is undoubtedly the correct reading in spite of
   Hellenists [Hellenistas] or Grecian Jews in B E H L P. [Hellenas] is
   read by A and D and a corrector of Aleph. The presence of "also" or
   "even" [kai] in Aleph A B makes no sense unless "Greeks" is correct.
   Hellenists or Grecian Jews as Christians were common enough as is seen
   in Ac 2; 6. Saul also had preached to the Hellenists in Jerusalem
   (9:29). Hellenists were merely one kind of Jews in contrast with those
   who spoke Aramaic (Ac 6). It is true that the case of Cornelius was
   first in importance, but it is not clear that it was before the work in
   Antioch. Probably the report of the work among the Greeks in Antioch
   reached Jerusalem after Peter's defence in 11:1-18. That explains the
   calm tone about it and also why Barnabas and not Peter was sent to
   investigate. Peter and John (Ac 8) had condoned Philip's work in
   Samaria and Peter was the agent in the work among the Romans in
   Caesarea. His position was now well-known and his services discounted
   for this new crisis. These Greeks in Antioch were apparently in part
   pure heathen and not "God-fearers" like Cornelius. A man of wisdom was
   called for. These preachers were themselves Hellenists (verse 19) and
   open to the lessons from their environment without a vision such as
   Peter had at Joppa. "It was a departure of startling boldness"
   (Furneaux) by laymen outside of the circle of official leaders.

   11:21 The hand of the Lord was with them [en cheir kuriou met' autOn].
   This O.T. phrase (Ex 9:3; Isa 59:1) is used by Luke (Lu 1:66; Ac 4:28,
   30; 13:11). It was proof of God's approval of their course in preaching
   the Lord Jesus to Greeks. Turned unto the Lord [epestrepsen epi ton
   kurion]. First aorist active indicative of [epistrephO], common verb to
   turn. The usual expression for Gentiles turning to the true God (14:15;
   15:3, 19; 26:18, 20; 1Th 1:9). Here "Lord" refers to "the Lord Jesus"
   as in verse 20, though "the hand of the Lord" is the hand of Jehovah,
   clearly showing that the early disciples put Jesus on a par with
   Jehovah. His deity was not a late development read back into the early
   history.

   11:22 Came to the ears [ekousthe eis ta Ota]. First aorist passive
   indicative of [akouO], was heard in the ears. Of the church which was
   in Jerusalem [tes ekklesias tes en Ierousalem]. Not yet was the term
   "church" applied to the group of disciples in Antioch as it is in
   11:26; 13:1. They sent forth [exapesteilan]. First aorist active
   indicative of the double compound verb [ex-apo-stellO], to send out and
   away. The choice of Barnabas was eminently wise. He already had a
   position of leadership in Jerusalem because of his generosity (4:36f.)
   and his championship of Saul after his conversion (9:27). He was
   originally from Cyprus and probably had personal friends among some of
   the leaders in this new movement. He was to investigate the work of the
   travelling preachers (verse 19) all the way to Antioch [heOs
   Antiocheias].

   11:23 The grace of God, was glad [ten charin ten tou theou echare].
   Note repetition of the article, "the grace that of God." The verb
   (second aorist passive indicative of [chairO] has the same root as
   [charis]. See the same suavis paronomasia in Lu 1:28. "Grace brings
   gladness" (Page). "A smaller man would have raised difficulties as to
   circumcision or baptism" (Furneaux). He exhorted [parekalei]. Imperfect
   active, picturing the continuous encouragement from Barnabas. With
   purpose of heart [tei prothesei tes kardias]. Placing before (from
   [pro-tithemi], old word for set plan as in Ac 27:13; Ro 8:28. The glow
   of the first enthusiasm might pass as often happens after a revival.
   Barnabas had a special gift (4:36) for work like this. Cleave unto the
   Lord [prosmenein [en] tOi kuriOi]. Dative case (locative if [en] is
   genuine) of [kurios] (here Jesus again) after [prosemenein] to keep on
   remaining loyal to (present active infinitive). Persistence was needed
   in such a pagan city.

   11:24 For [hoti]. Because. This is the explanation of the conduct of
   Barnabas. The facts were opposed to the natural prejudices of a Jew
   like Barnabas, but he rose above such racial narrowness. He was a
   really good man [agathos]. See Ro 5:7 for distinction between [agathos]
   and [dikaios], righteous, where [agathos] ranks higher than [dikaios].
   Besides, Barnabas was full of the Holy Spirit (like Peter) and of faith
   and so willing to follow the leading of God's Spirit and take some
   risks. This is a noble tribute paid by Luke. One wonders if Barnabas
   was still living when he wrote this. Certainly he was not prejudiced
   against Barnabas though he will follow the fortunes of Paul after the
   separation (15:36-41). Was added unto the Lord [prosetethe tOi kuriOi].
   First aorist passive indicative of [prostithemi], common verb to add
   to. These people were added to the Lord Jesus before they were added to
   the church. If that were always true, what a difference it would make
   in our churches.

   11:25 To seek for Saul [anazetesai Saulon]. First aorist (effective)
   active infinitive of purpose. [AnazeteO] is a common verb since Plato,
   but in the N.T. only here and Lu 2:44, 45, to seek up and down [ana],
   back and forth, to hunt up, to make a thorough search till success
   comes. It is plain from Ga 1:21 that Saul had not been idle in Cilicia.
   Tarsus was not very far from Antioch. Barnabas probably knew that Saul
   was a vessel of choice (Ac 9:15) by Christ for the work among the
   Gentiles. He knew, of course, of Saul's work with the Hellenists in
   Jerusalem (9:29) and echoes of his work in Cilicia and Syria had
   probably come to him. So to Tarsus he goes when he saw the need for
   help. "He had none of the littleness which cannot bear the presence of
   a possible rival" (Furneaux). Barnabas knew his own limitations and
   knew where the man of destiny for this crisis was, the man who already
   had the seal of God upon him. The hour and the man met when Barnabas
   brought Saul to Antioch. The door was open and the man was ready, far
   more ready than when Jesus called him on the road to Damascus. The
   years in Cilicia and Syria were not wasted for they had not been idle.
   If we only knew the facts, it is probable that Saul also had been
   preaching to Hellenes as well as to Hellenists. Jesus had definitely
   called him to work among the Gentiles (9:15). In his own way he had
   come to the same place that Peter reached in Caesarea and that Barnabas
   now holds in Antioch. God always has a man prepared for a great
   emergency in the kingdom. The call of Barnabas was simply the
   repetition of the call of Christ. So Saul came.

   11:26 Even for a whole year [kai eniauton holon]. Accusative of extent
   of time, probably the year A.D. 44, the year preceding the visit to
   Jerusalem (11:30), the year of the famine. The preceding years with
   Tarsus as headquarters covered A.D. 37 (39) to 44. They were gathered
   together with the church [sunachthenai en tei ekklesiai]. First aorist
   passive infinitive of [sunagO], old verb, probably here to meet
   together as in Mt 28:12. In Ac 14:27 the verb is used of gathering
   together the church, but here [en tei ekklesiai] excludes that idea.
   Barnabas met together "in the church" (note first use of the word for
   the disciples at Antioch). This peculiar phrase accents the leadership
   and co-operation of Barnabas and Saul in teaching [didaxai], first
   aorist active infinitive) much people. Both infinitives are in the
   nominative case, the subject of [egeneto] (it came to pass). And that
   the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch [chrematisai te
   prOtOs en Antiocheiai tous mathetas Christianous]. This first active
   infinitive [chrematisai] is also a subject of [egeneto] and is added as
   a separate item by the use of [te] rather than [kai]. For the word
   itself in the sense of divine command see on Mt 2:12, 22; Lu 2:26; Ac
   10:22. Here and in Ro 7:3 it means to be called or named (assuming a
   name from one's business, [chrema], from [chraomai], to use or to do
   business). Polybius uses it in this sense as here. [Tous mathetas] (the
   disciples) is in the accusative of general reference with the
   infinitive. [Christianous] (Christians) is simply predicate accusative.
   This word is made after the pattern of [Herodianus] (Mt 22:16,
   [HerOidianoi], followers of Herod), [Caesarianus], a follower of Caesar
   (Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East, p. 377, gives papyri examples
   of the genitive [Kaisaros] meaning also "belonging to Caesar" like the
   common adjective [Caesarianus]. It is made thus like a Latin adjective,
   though it is a Greek word, and it refers to the Hebrew belief in a
   Messiah (Page). The name was evidently given to the followers of Christ
   by the Gentiles to distinguish them from the Jews since they were
   Greeks, not Grecian Jews. The Jews would not call them Christians
   because of their own use of [Christos] the Messiah. The Jews termed
   them Galileans or Nazarenes. The followers of Christ called themselves
   disciples (learners), believers, brethren, saints, those of the Way.
   The three uses of Christian in the N.T. are from the heathen standpoint
   (here), Ac 26:28 (a term of contempt in the mouth of Agrippa), and 1Pe
   4:16 (persecution from the Roman government). It is a clear distinction
   from both Jews and Gentiles and it is not strange that it came into use
   first here in Antioch when the large Greek church gave occasion for it.
   Later Ignatius was bishop in Antioch and was given to the lions in
   Rome, and John Chrysostom preached here his wonderful sermons.

   11:27 Prophets [prophetai]. Christian prophets these were (cf. 13:1)
   who came from Jerusalem (the headquarters, 8:15). Judas and Silas are
   called prophets (14:4; 15:32). They were not just fore-tellers, but
   forth-tellers. The prophet had inspiration and was superior to the
   speaker with tongues (1Co 14:3). John was a prophet (Lu 7:26). We need
   prophets in the ministry today.

   11:28 Signified [esemainen]. Imperfect active in Westcott and Hort, but
   aorist active [esemanen] in the margin. The verb is an old one from
   [sema] [semeion] a sign (cf. the symbolic sign in 21:11). Here Agabus
   (also in 21:10) does predict a famine through the Holy Spirit. Should
   be [mellein esesthai]. [MellO] occurs either with the present
   infinitive (16:27), the aorist infinitive (12:6), or the future as here
   and 24:15; 27:10. Over all the world [eph' holen ten oikoumenen]. Over
   all the inhabited earth [gen], understood). Probably a common hyperbole
   for the Roman empire as in Lu 2:1. Josephus (Ant. VIII. 13, 4) appears
   to restrict it to Palestine. In the days of Claudius [epi Klaudiou]. He
   was Roman Emperor A.D. 41-44. The Roman writers (Suetonius, Dio
   Cassius, Tacitus) all tell of dearths (assiduae sterilitates) during
   the brief reign of Claudius who was preceded by Caligula and followed
   by Nero.

   11:29 Every man according to his ability [kathOs euporeito tis].
   Imperfect middle of [euporeO], to be well off (from [euporos], old
   verb, but here alone in the N.T., "as any one was well off." The
   sentence is a bit tangled in the Greek from Luke's rush of ideas.
   Literally, "Of the disciples, as any one was able (or well off), they
   determined [hOrisan], marked off the horizon) each of them to send
   relief [eis diakonian], for ministry) to the brethren who dwelt in
   Judaea." The worst of the famine came A.D. 45. The warning by Agabus
   stirred the brethren in Antioch to send the collection on ahead.

   11:30 Sending [aposteilantes]. First aorist active participle of
   [apostellO], coincident action with [epoiesan] (did). To the elders
   [pros tous presbuterous]. The first use of that term for the Christian
   preachers. In 20:17, 28 "elders" and "bishops" are used interchangeably
   as in Tit 1:5, 7. The term probably arose gradually and holds a
   position in the church similar to the same term in the synagogue. The
   apostles were apparently absent from Jerusalem at this time and they
   were no longer concerned with serving tables. In 21:18 Paul presented
   the later collection also to the elders. Since Peter and James (till
   his death) were in Jerusalem during the persecution in chapter 12 it is
   probable that the visit of Barnabas and Saul to Jerusalem came really
   after that persecution for Peter left Jerusalem (12:17). The elders
   here mentioned may include the preachers in Judea also outside of
   Jerusalem (26:20).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 12

   12:1 About that time [kat' ekeinon ton kairon]. Same phrase in Ro 9:9.
   That is, the early part of A.D. 44 since that is the date of Herod's
   death. As already suggested, Barnabas and Saul came down from Antioch
   to Jerusalem after the persecution by Herod at the end of 44 or the
   beginning of 45. Herod the king [HerOides ho basileus]. Accurate title
   at this particular time. Herod Agrippa I, grandson of Herod the Great,
   was King of Palestine A.D. 42 to 44; only for these three years was a
   Herod king over Palestine since the death of Herod the Great and never
   afterwards. Archelaus never actually became king though he had the
   popular title at first (Mt 2:22). Put forth his hands [epebalen tas
   cheiras]. Second aorist active indicative of [epiballO], old verb, to
   cast upon or against. The same idiom with [tas cheiras] (the hands,
   common Greek idiom with article rather than possessive pronoun) in 4:3;
   5:18. To afflict [kakOsai]. First aorist active infinitive of [kakoO],
   old word to do harm or evil to [kakos], already in 7:6, 19. Outside of
   Acts in the N.T. only 1Pe 5:13. Infinitive of purpose. Probably the
   first who were afflicted were scourged or imprisoned, not put to death.
   It had been eight years or more since the persecution over the death of
   Stephen ceased with the conversion of Saul. But the disciples were not
   popular in Jerusalem with either Sadducees or Pharisees. The overtures
   to the Gentiles in Caesarea and Antioch may have stirred up the
   Pharisees afresh (cf. 6:14). Herod Agrippa I was an Idumean through his
   grandfather Herod the Great and a grandson of Mariamne the Maccabean
   princess. He was a favourite of Caligula the Roman Emperor and was
   anxious to placate his Jewish subjects while retaining the favour of
   the Romans. So he built theatres and held games for the Romans and
   Greeks and slew the Christians to please the Jews. Josephus (Ant. XIX.
   7, 3) calls him a pleasant vain man scrupulously observing Jewish
   rites. Here we have for the first time political power (after Pilate)
   used against the disciples.

   12:2 James the brother of John [IakObon ton adelphon IOanou]. He had
   been called by Jesus a son of thunder along with his brother John.
   Jesus had predicted a bloody death for both of them (Mr 10:38ff.; Mt
   20:23). James is the first of the apostles to die and John probably the
   last. He is not James the Lord's brother (Ga 1:19). We do not know why
   Luke tells so little about the death of James and so much about the
   death of Stephen nor do we know why Herod selected him as a victim.
   Eusebius (H.E. ii. 9) quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that a Jew
   made accusations against James and was converted and beheaded at the
   same time with him. Killed with the sword [aneilen machairei]. The verb
   is a favourite one with Luke (Ac 2:33; 5:33,36; 7:28; 9:23-29; 10:39,
   etc.). Instrumental case and Ionic form of [machaira]. The Jews
   considered beheading a shameful death as in the case of the Baptist (Mt
   14:10).

   12:3 That it pleased the Jews [hoti areston estin tois Ioudaiois].
   Indirect assertion with the present tense [estin] retained. [Areston]
   is the verbal adjective from [areskO] followed by the dative as in Joh
   8:29. Proceeded to seize [prosetheto sullabein]. A patent Hebraism in
   Lu 20:11f. already, and nowhere else in the N.T. It occurs in the LXX
   (Ge 4:2; 8:12; 18:29, etc.). Second aorist middle indicative of
   [prostithemi] and the second aorist active infinitive of [sullambanO].
   Literally, he added to seize, he seized Peter in addition to James. The
   days of unleavened bread [hemerai tOn azumOn]. By this parenthesis Luke
   locates the time of the year when Peter was arrested, the passover. It
   was a fine occasion for Agrippa to increase his favour among the crowds
   of Jews there by extra zeal against the Christians. It is possible that
   Luke obtained his information about this incident from John Mark for at
   his Mother's house the disciples gathered (12:12).

   12:4 When he had taken him [piasas]. See on 3:7 for same form. He put
   him in prison [etheto eis phulaken]. Second aorist middle indicative of
   [tithemi], common verb. This is the third imprisonment of Peter (4:3;
   5:18). To four quaternions of soldiers [tessarsin tetradiois
   stratiOtOn]. Four soldiers in each quaternion [tetradion] from
   [tetras], four), two on the inside with the prisoner (chained to him)
   and two on the outside, in shifts of six hours each, sixteen soldiers
   in all, the usual Roman custom. Probably Agrippa had heard of Peter's
   previous escape (5:19) and so took no chances for connivance of the
   jailors. After the passover [meta to pascha]. The passover feast of
   eight days. "The stricter Jews regarded it as a profanation to put a
   person to death during a religious festival" (Hackett). So Agrippa is
   more scrupulous than the Sanhedrin was about Jesus. To bring him forth
   [anagagein auton]. Second aorist active infinitive of [anagO], to lead
   up, old verb, used literally here. Peter was in the inner prison or
   lower ward and so would be led up to the judgment seat where Herod
   Agrippa would sit (cf. Joh 19:13). To the people [tOi laOi]. Ethical
   dative, in the presence of and for the pleasure of the Jewish people.

   12:5 Therefore [men oun]. Because of the preceding situation. Was kept
   [etereito]. Imperfect passive, continuously guarded, waiting for the
   feast to be over. But prayer was made earnestly [proseuche de en
   ektenOs ginomene]. Probably [de] here is not adversative (but), merely
   parallel (and) as Page argues. It was a crisis for the Jerusalem
   church. James had been slain and Peter was to be the next victim. Hence
   "earnestly" (late adverb from [ektenes], strained, from [ekteinO], to
   stretch. In the N.T. only here, Lu 22:44; 1Pe 1:22) prayer was going up
   [ginomene], present middle participle, periphrastic imperfect with
   [en]. It looked like a desperate case for Peter. Hence the disciples
   prayed the more earnestly.

   12:6 Was about to bring him forth [emellen prosagagein] or
   [proagagein]. The MSS. vary, but not [anagagein] of verse 4. The same
   night [tei nukti ekeinei]. Locative case, on that (very) night. Was
   sleeping [en koimOmenos]. Periphrastic middle imperfect. Bound with two
   chains [dedemenos halusesin dusin]. Perfect passive participle of
   [deO], to bind, followed by instrumental case. One chain was fastened
   to each soldier (one on each side of Peter). Kept [eteroun]. Imperfect
   active, were keeping. Two guards outside before the door and two
   inside, according to Roman rule. Did Peter recall the prophecy of Jesus
   that he should be put to death in his old age (Joh 21:18)? Jesus had
   not said, as Furneaux does, that he would die by crucifixion.

   12:7 Stood by him [epeste]. Ingressive second aorist active indicative
   of [ephistemi], intransitive. This very form occurs in Lu 2:9 of the
   sudden appearance of the angel of the Lord to the shepherds. Page notes
   that this second aorist of [ephistemi] occurs seven times in the Gospel
   of Luke, eight times in the Acts, and nowhere else in the N.T. Note
   also the same form [apeste] (departed from, from [aphistemi], stood off
   from) of the disappearance of the angel in verse 10. In the cell [en
   tOi oikemati]. Literally, a dwelling place or habitation (from [oikeO],
   to dwell, [oikos], house), but here not the prison as a whole as in
   Thucydides, but the room in the prison (cell) where Peter was chained
   to the two guards. Old word, but only here in the N.T. He smote Peter
   on the side [pataxas ten pleuran tou Petrou]. More exactly, "smote the
   side of Peter." Strongly enough to wake Peter up who was sound asleep
   and yet not rouse the two guards. It was probably between 3 A.M. and 6
   A.M., hours when changes in the guards were made. Rise up [anasta].
   Short form (Koine) of [anastethi], second aorist active imperative of
   [anistemi], intransitive. So also Ac 9:11 (Westcott and Hort text); Eph
   5:14. Fell off [exepesan]. Second aorist active with [a] ending like
   first aorist of [expiptO], old verb. This miracle was necessary if
   Peter was to escape without rousing the two guards.

   12:8 Gird thyself [zOsai]. Direct middle first aorist (ingressive)
   imperative (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 806f.) from [zOnnumi] [zOnnuO]. Old
   verb, but in the N.T. only here and Joh 21:18 (twice to Peter) where
   the active voice and the reflexive pronoun occur in the first example.
   The girdle was worn round the [chitOn] or undergarment. Bind on
   [hupodesai]. Indirect middle (by yourself or for yourself) first aorist
   imperative of [hupodeO], to bind under, old verb, only three times in
   the N.T. (Mr 6:9; Ac 12:8; Eph 6:15 (middle)). Sandals [sandalia].
   Persian word common from Herodotus on, a sole made of wood or leather
   covering the bottom of the foot and bound on with thongs. In the N.T.
   only here and Mr 6:9. In the LXX used indiscriminately with [hupodema].
   Cast about thee [peribalou]. Second aorist middle (indirect) imperative
   of [periballO], old and common verb to throw around, especially
   clothing around the body as here. The [himation] (outer garment) was
   put over the [chitOn]. It was not a hurried flight. Follow me
   [akolouthei moi]. Present (linear) active imperative, keep on following
   me (associative instrumental case).

   12:9 Wist not [ouk eidei]. Past perfect of [oida] used as imperfect,
   did not know. Followed [ekolouthei]. Imperfect active, kept on
   following as the angel had directed (verse 8). That it was true [hoti
   alethes estin]. Indirect assertion and so present tense retained. Note
   "true" [alethes] in the sense of reality or actuality. Which was done
   [to ginomenon]. Present middle participle, that which was happening.
   Thought he saw a vision [edokei horama blepein]. Imperfect active, kept
   on thinking, puzzled as he was. [Blepein] is the infinitive in indirect
   assertion without the pronoun (he) expressed which could be either
   nominative in apposition with the subject as in Ro 1:22 or accusative
   of general reference as in Ac 5:36; 8:9 (Robertson, Grammar, pp.
   1036-40). Peter had had a vision in Joppa (10:10) which Luke describes
   as an "ecstasy," but here is objective fact, at least Luke thought so
   and makes that distinction. Peter will soon know whether he is still in
   the cell or not as we find out that a dream is only a dream when we
   wake up.

   12:10 When they were past [dielthontes]. Second aorist active
   participle of [dierchomai], transitive with [dia] in composition. The
   first and the second ward [prOten phulaken kai deuteran]. It is not
   clear to what this language refers. Some take it to mean single
   soldiers, using [phulaken] in the sense of a guard (one before the
   door, one at the iron gate). But it seems hardly likely that the two
   soldiers with whom Peter had been stationed are meant. Probably the
   "first ward" means the two soldiers of the quaternion stationed by the
   door and the second ward some other soldiers, not part of the sixteen,
   further on in the prison by the iron gate. However understood, the
   difficulties of escape are made plain. Unto the iron gate that leadeth
   into the city [epi ten pulen ten sideran ten pherousan eis ten polin].
   Note the triple use of the article (the gate the iron one the one
   leading into the city). For this resumptive use of the article see
   Robertson, Grammar, pp. 762, 764. This iron gate may have opened from a
   court out into the street and effectually barred escape. Opened to them
   [enoige autois]. Second aorist passive indicative of [anoigO], the
   usual later form though [enoichthe] (first aorist passive) occurs also,
   was opened. Of its own accord [automate]. Old compound adjective
   [autos], self, obsolete [maO], to desire eagerly, feminine form though
   masculine [automatos] also used as feminine). In the N.T. only here and
   Mr 4:28. It was a strange experience for Peter. The Codex Bezae adds
   here "went down the seven steps" [katebesan tous hepta bathmous], an
   interesting detail that adds to the picture. One street [rhumen mian].
   The angel saw Peter through one of the narrow streets and then left
   him. We have no means of knowing precisely the location of the prison
   in the city. On "departed" [apeste] see on verse 7.

   12:11 Was come to himself [en heautOi genomenos]. Second aorist middle
   participle of [ginomai] with [en] and the locative case, "becoming at
   himself." In Lu 15:17 we have [eis heauton elthOn] (coming to himself,
   as if he had been on a trip away from himself). Now I know of a truth
   [nun oida alethOs]. There was no further confusion of mind that it was
   an ecstasy as in 10:10. But he was in peril for the soldiers would soon
   learn of his escape, when the change of guards came at 6 A.M. Delivered
   me [exeilato me]. Second aorist middle indicative of [exaireO]. The
   Lord rescued me of himself by his angel. Expectation [prosdokias]. Old
   word from [prosdokaO], to look for. In the N.T. only here and Lu 21:26.
   James had been put to death and the Jewish people were eagerly waiting
   for the execution of Peter like hungry wolves.

   12:12 When he had considered [sunidOn]. Second aorist active participle
   of [suneidon] (for the defective verb [sunoraO], to see together, to
   grasp as a whole, old verb, but in the N.T. only here and 14:6, save
   the perfect indicative [sunoida] (1Co 4:4) and participle (Ac 5:2). It
   is the word from which [suneidesis] (conscience) comes (Ro 2:15).
   Peter's mind worked rapidly and he decided what to do. He took in his
   situation clearly. To the house of Mary [epi ten oikian tes Marias].
   Another Mary (the others were Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary of
   Bethany, Mary Magdalene, Mary wife of Cleopas, Mary the mother of James
   and Joses). She may have been a widow and was possessed of some means
   since her house was large enough to hold the large group of disciples
   there. Barnabas, cousin of John Mark her son (Col 4:10), was also a man
   of property or had been (Ac 4:36f.). It is probable that the disciples
   had been in the habit of meeting in her house, a fact known to Peter
   and he was evidently fond of John Mark whom he afterwards calls "my
   son" (1Pe 5:13) and whom he had met here. The upper room of Ac 1:13 may
   have been in Mary's house and Mark may have been the man bearing a
   pitcher of water (Lu 22:10) and the young man who fled in the Garden of
   Gethsemane (Mr 14:51f.). There was a gate and portress here as in the
   house of the highpriest (Joh 18:16). Peter knew where to go and even at
   this early hour hoped to find some of the disciples. Mary is one of the
   many mothers who have become famous by reason of their sons, though she
   was undoubtedly a woman of high character herself. Were gathered
   together and were praying [esan sunethroismenoi kai proseuchomenoi].
   Note difference in the tenses, one periphrastic past perfect passive
   [sunathroizO] old verb, in the N.T. here only and 19:25 and the
   uncompounded [throizO] in Lu 24:33) and the periphrastic imperfect. The
   praying apparently had been going on all night and a large number
   (many, [hikanoi] of the disciples were there. One recalls the time when
   they had gathered to pray (4:31) after Peter had told the disciples of
   the threats of the Sanhedrin (4:23). God had rescued Peter then. Would
   he let him be put to death now as James had been?

   12:13 When he knocked at the door of the gate [krousantos autou ten
   thuran tou pulOnos]. Genitive absolute with aorist active participle of
   [krouO], common verb to knock or knock at. So from the outside (Lu
   13:25). [PulOn] here is the gateway or passageway from the door [thura]
   that leads to the house. In verse 14 it is still the passageway without
   the use of [thura] (door, so for both door and passageway). To answer
   [hupakousai]. To listen under before opening. First aorist active
   infinitive of [hupakouO], common verb to obey, to hearken. A maid
   [paidiske]. Portress as in Joh 18:17. A diminutive of [pais], a female
   slave (so on an ostracon of second century A.D., Deissmann, Light from
   the Ancient East, p. 200). Rhoda. A rose. Women can have such beautiful
   names like Dorcas (Gazelle), Euodia (Sweet Aroma), Syntyche (Good
   Luck). Mark or Peter could tell Luke her name.

   12:14 When she knew [epignousa]. Second aorist (ingressive) active
   participle of [epiginOskO], to know fully or in addition [epi], to
   recognize. She knew Peter and his voice from his frequent visits there.
   For joy [apo tes charas]. From her joy (ablative case), life-like
   picture of the maid who left Peter standing outside with the door to
   the passageway unopened. Note the aorist tenses for quick action [ouk
   enoixen], [eisdramousa] (from [eistrechO], defective verb, only here in
   the N.T.), [apeggeilen]. Stood [hestanai]. Second perfect active
   infinitive of [histemi], intransitive, in indirect assertion with [ton
   Petron] (Peter) accusative of general reference. The slave girl acted
   as if she were a member of the family (Furneaux), but she left Peter in
   peril.

   12:15 Thou art mad [mainei]. Present middle indicative second person
   singular. Old verb, only in the middle voice. Festus used the same word
   to Paul (26:24). The maid was undoubtedly excited, but it was a curious
   rebuff from those who had been praying all night for Peter's release.
   In their defence it may be said that Stephen and James had been put to
   death and many others by Saul's persecution. She confidently affirmed
   [diischurizeto]. Imperfect middle of [diischurizomai], an old word of
   vigorous and confident assertion, originally to lean upon. Only here in
   the N.T. The girl stuck to her statement. It is his angel [Ho aggelos
   estin autou]. This was the second alternative of the disciples. It was
   a popular Jewish belief that each man had a guardian angel. Luke takes
   no position about it. No scripture teaches it.

   12:16 Continued knocking [epemenen krouOn]. Imperfect active and
   present participle. Now all heard the knocking. When they had opened
   [anoixantes]. First aorist active participle of [anoigO] or [-numi].
   The whole group rushed out to the courtyard this time to make sure.
   They were amazed [exestesan]. The frequent second aorist active
   (intransitive) indicative of [existemi].

   12:17 There were probably loud exclamations of astonishment and joy.
   Beckoning with the hand [kataseisas tei cheiri]. First aorist active
   participle of [kataseiO], old verb to signal or shake down with the
   hand (instrumental case [cheiri]. In the N.T. only in Ac 12:17; 13:16;
   19:33; 21:40. The speaker indicates by a downward movement of the hand
   his desire for silence (to hold their peace, [sigain], present active
   infinitive, to keep silent). Peter was anxious for every precaution and
   he wanted their instant attention. Declared [diegesato]. First aorist
   middle of [diegeomai], old verb to carry through a narrative, give a
   full story. See also Ac 9:27 of Barnabas in his defence of Saul. Peter
   told them the wonderful story. Unto James and the brethren [IakObOi kai
   tois adelphois]. Dative case after [apaggeilate] (first aorist active
   imperative). Evidently "James and the brethren" were not at this
   meeting, probably meeting elsewhere. There was no place where all the
   thousands of disciples in Jerusalem could meet. This gathering in the
   house of Mary may have been of women only or a meeting of the
   Hellenists. It is plain that this James the Lord's brother, is now the
   leading presbyter or elder in Jerusalem though there were a number
   (11:30; 21:18). Paul even terms him apostle (Gal 1:19), though
   certainly not one of the twelve. The twelve apostles probably were
   engaged elsewhere in mission work save James now dead (Ac 12:2) and
   Peter. The leadership of James is here recognized by Peter and is due,
   partly to the absence of the twelve, but mainly to his own force of
   character. He will preside over the Jerusalem Conference (Ac 15:13). To
   another place [eis heteron topon]. Probably Luke did not know the place
   and certainly it was prudent for Peter to conceal it from Herod
   Agrippa. Probably Peter left the city. He is back in Jerusalem at the
   Conference a few years later (Ac 15:7) and after the death of Herod
   Agrippa. Whether Peter went to Rome during these years we do not know.
   He was recognized later as the apostle to the circumcision (Gal 2:7;
   1Pe 1:1) and apparently was in Rome with John Mark when he wrote the
   First Epistle (1Pe 5:13), unless it is the real Babylon. But, even if
   Peter went to Rome during this early period, there is no evidence that
   he founded the church there. If he had done so, in the light of 2Co
   10:16 it would be strange that Paul had not mentioned it in writing to
   Rome, for he was anxious not to build on another man's foundation (Ro
   15:20). Paul felt sure that he himself had a work to do in Rome.
   Unfortunately Luke has not followed the ministry of Peter after this
   period as he does Paul (appearing again only in chapter Ac 15). If
   Peter really left Jerusalem at this time instead of hiding in the city,
   he probably did some mission work as Paul says that he did (1Co 9:5).

   12:18 As soon as it was day [Genomenes hemeras]. Genitive absolute, day
   having come. No small stir [tarachos ouk oligos]. Litotes [ouk oligos],
   occurs eight times in the Acts as in 15:2, and nowhere else in the N.T.
   [Tarachos] (stir) is an old word from [tarassO], to agitate. In the N.T
   only here and 19:23. Probably all sixteen soldiers were agitated over
   this remarkable escape. They were responsible for the prisoner with
   their lives (cf. Ac 16:27; 27:42). Furneaux suggests that Manaen, the
   king's foster-brother and a Christian (13:1), was the "angel" who
   rescued Peter from the prison. That is not the way that Peter looked at
   it. What was become of Peter [ti ara ho Petros egeneto]. An indirect
   question with the aorist indicative retained. [Ara] adds a syllogism
   (therefore) to the problem as in Lu 1:66. The use of the neuter [ti]
   (as in Ac 13:25) is different from [tis], though nominative like
   [Petros], literally, "what then Peter had become," "what had happened
   to Peter" (in one idiom). See the same idiom in Joh 21:21 [houtos de
   ti]. But this one what (verb [genesetai] not used).

   12:19 He examined [anakrinas]. First aorist active participle of
   [anakrinO], old verb to sift up and down, to question thoroughly, in a
   forensic sense (Lu 23:14; Ac 4:9; 12:19; 28:18). That they should be
   put to death [apachthenai]. First aorist passive infinitive (indirect
   command) of [apagO], old verb to lead away, especially to execution as
   in Mt 27:31. Here it is used absolutely. This was the ordinary Roman
   routine and not a proof of special cruelty on the part of Herod
   Agrippa. Tarried [dietriben]. Imperfect active. Herod Agrippa made his
   home in Jerusalem, but he went to Caesarea to the public games in
   honour of Emperor Claudius.

   12:20 Was highly displeased [en thumomachOn]. Periphrastic imperfect
   active of [thumomacheO], late compound of [thumos] (passionate heat)
   and [machomai], to fight. Only here in the N.T., to fight desperately,
   to have a hot quarrel. Whether it was open war with the Phoenicians or
   just violent hostility we do not know, save that Phoenicia belonged to
   Syria and Herod Agrippa had no authority there. The quarrel may have
   been over commercial matters. They came with one accord [homothumadon
   paresan]. The representatives of Tyre and Sidon. See on 1:14 for
   [homothumadon]. Tyre was a colony of Sidon and had become one of the
   chief commercial cities of the world by reason of the Phoenician ships.
   The king's chamberlain [ton epi tou koitOnos tou basileos]. The one
   over the bedchamber [koitOnos], late word from [koite], bed, here only
   in the N.T.). Made their friend [peisantes]. First aorist active
   participle of [peithO], to persuade. Having persuaded (probably with
   bribes as in Mt 28:14). They asked for peace [eitounto eirenen].
   Imperfect middle of [aiteO], kept on asking for peace. Because their
   country was fed [dia to trephesthai autOn ten choran]. Causal sentence
   with [dia] and the articular infinitive (present passive of [trephO],
   to nourish or feed) and the accusative of general reference, "because
   of the being fed as to their country." Tyre and Sidon as large
   commercial cities on the coast received large supplies of grain and
   fruits from Palestine. Herod had cut off the supplies and that brought
   the two cities to action.

   12:21 Upon a set day [taktei hemerai]. Locative case and the verbal
   adjective of [tassO], to arrange, appoint, old word, here only in the
   N.T. Josephus (Ant. XVII. 6, 8; XIX. 8, 2) gives a full account of the
   occasion and the death of Herod Agrippa. It was the second day of the
   festival in honour of the Emperor Claudius, possibly his birthday
   rather than the Quinquennalia. The two accounts of Luke and Josephus
   supplement each other with no contradiction. Josephus does not mention
   the name of Blastus. Arrayed himself in royal apparel [endusamenos
   estheta basiliken]. First aorist middle (indirect) participle of
   [endunO] or [enduO], common verb to put on. Literally, having put royal
   apparel on himself (a robe of silver tissue, Josephus says). The rays
   of the sun shone on this brilliant apparel and the vast crowd in the
   open amphitheatre became excited as Herod began to speak. Made an
   oration [edemegorei]. Imperfect active of [demegoreO], old verb from
   [demegoros] (haranguer of the people), and that from [demos] (people)
   and [agoreuO], to harangue or address the people. Only here in the N.T.
   He kept it up.

   12:22 Shouted [epephOnei]. Imperfect active, kept on shouting, calling
   out to him. Old verb, but only four times in the N.T. and all by Luke.
   The heathen crowd [demos] repeated their flattering adulation to gain
   Herod's favour. The voice of a god [theou phOne]. In the pagan sense of
   emperor worship, not as the Supreme Being. But it was pleasing to Herod
   Agrippa's vanity.

   12:23 Smote him [epataxen auton]. Effective aorist active indicative of
   [patassO], old verb, used already in verse 7 of gentle smiting of the
   angel of the Lord, here of a severe stroke of affliction. Like
   Nebuchadnezzar (Da 4:30) pride went before a fall. He was struck down
   in the very zenith of his glory. Because [anth' hOn]. [Anti] with the
   genitive of the relative pronoun, "in return for which things." He
   accepted the impious flattery (Hackett) instead of giving God the
   glory. He was a nominal Jew. He was eaten of worms [genomenos
   skOlekobrOtos]. Ingressive aorist middle participle, "becoming
   worm-eaten." The compound verbal adjective [skOlex], worm, [brOtos],
   eaten, from [bibrOskO] is a late word (II Macc. 9:9) of the death of
   Antiochus Epiphanes, used also of a tree (Theophrastus), here only in
   the N.T. The word [skOlex] was used of intestinal worms and Herodotus
   (IV. 205) describes Pheretima, Queen of Cyrene, as having swarms of
   worms which ate her flesh while still alive. Josephus (Ant. XIX. 8, 2)
   says that Herod Agrippa lingered for five days and says that the
   rotting of his flesh produced worms, an item in harmony with the
   narrative in Luke. Josephus gives further details, one a superstitious
   sight of an owl sitting on one of the ropes of the awning of the
   theatre while the people flattered him, an omen of his death to him.
   Luke puts it simply that God smote him. Gave up the ghost [exepsuxen].
   Effective aorist active of [ekpsuchO], to breathe out, late verb,
   medical term in Hippocrates, in the N.T. only in Ac 5:5, 10; 12:23.
   Herod was carried out of the theatre a dying man and lingered only five
   days.

   12:24 Grew and multiplied [euxanen kai eplethuneto]. Imperfect active
   and passive. Cf. 6:1. The reaction from the death of James and the
   imprisonment of Peter.

   12:25 From Jerusalem [ex Ierousalem]. Probably correct text, though D
   has [apo]. Westcott and Hort follow Aleph B in reading [eis] (to)
   Jerusalem, an impossible reading contradicted by 11:29f.; 13:1. The
   ministration [diakonian] referred to is that in 11:29f. which may have
   taken place, in point of time, after the death of Herod. Taking with
   them [sunparalabontes]. Taking along [para] with [sun] them, John Mark
   from Jerusalem (12:12) to Antioch (13:1). The aorist participle does
   not express subsequent action as Rackham here argues (Robertson,
   Grammar, pp. 861-863).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 13

   13:1 In the church that was there [kata ten ousan ekklesian]. Possibly
   distributed throughout the church (note "in the church" 11:26). Now a
   strong organization there. Luke here begins the second part of Acts
   with Antioch as the centre of operations, no longer Jerusalem. Paul is
   now the central figure instead of Peter. Jerusalem had hesitated too
   long to carry out the command of Jesus to take the gospel to the whole
   world. That glory will now belong to Antioch. Prophets and teachers
   [prophetai kai didaskaloi]. All prophets were teachers, but not all
   teachers were prophets who were for-speakers of God, sometimes
   fore-speakers like Agabus in 11:28. The double use of [te] here makes
   three prophets (Barnabas, Symeon, Lucius) and two teachers (Manaen and
   Saul). Barnabas heads the list (11:22) and Saul comes last. Symeon
   Niger may be the Simon of Cyrene who carried the Saviour's cross.
   Lucius of Cyrene was probably one of the original evangelists (11:20).
   The name is one of the forms of Luke, but it is certainly not Luke the
   Physician. Manaen shows how the gospel was reaching some of the higher
   classes (home of Herod Antipas). Foster-brother [suntrophos]. Old word
   for nourished with or brought up with one collactaneus (Vulgate). These
   are clearly the outstanding men in the great Greek church in Antioch.

   13:2 As they ministered to the Lord [leitourgountOn autOn toi kuriOi].
   Genitive absolute of [leitourgeO], old verb, used of the Attic orators
   who served the state at their own cost [leOs] or [laos], people, and
   [ergon], work or service). Common in the LXX of the priests who served
   in the tabernacle (Ex 28:31, 39) like [leitourgia] (Lu 1:23) which see.
   So in Heb 10:11. In Ro 15:27 of aiding others in poverty. Here of
   worship (prayer, exhortation, fasting). The word liturgy grows out of
   this use. And fasted [kai nesteuontOn]. Genitive absolute also.
   Christian Jews were keeping up the Jewish fast (Lu 18:12). Note fasting
   also in the choice of elders for the Mission Churches (Ac 14:23).
   Fasting was not obligatory on the Christians, but they were facing a
   great emergency in giving the gospel to the Gentile world. Separate me
   [aphorisate de moi]. First aorist active imperative of [aphorizO], old
   verb to mark off boundaries or horizon, used by Paul of his call (Ro
   1:1; Ga 1:15). The Greek has [de], a shortened form of [ede] and like
   Latin jam and German doch, now therefore. It ought to be preserved in
   the translation. Cf. Lu 2:15; Ac 15:36; 1Co 6:20. [Moi] is the ethical
   dative. As in verse 1 Barnabas is named before Saul. Both had been
   called to ministry long ago, but now this call is to the special
   campaign among the Gentiles. Both had been active and useful in such
   work. Whereunto [ho]. Here [eis] has to be repeated from [eis to ergon]
   just before, "for which" as Jesus sent the twelve and the seventy in
   pairs, so here. Paul nearly always had one or more companions.

   13:3 When they had fasted [nesteusantes]. Either finishing the same
   fast in verse 2 or another one (Hackett), but clearly a voluntary fast.
   Laid their hands upon them [epithentes tas cheiras autois]. Second
   aorist active participle of [epitithemi]. Not ordination to the
   ministry, but a solemn consecration to the great missionary task to
   which the Holy Spirit had called them. Whether the whole church took
   part in this ceremony is not clear, though in 15:40 "the brethren" did
   commend Paul and Silas. Perhaps some of them here acted for the whole
   church, all of whom approved the enterprise. But Paul makes it plain in
   Php 4:15 that the church in Antioch did not make financial contribution
   to the campaign, but only goodwill. But that was more than the church
   at Jerusalem would have done as a whole since Peter had been arraigned
   there for his activities in Caesarea (Ac 11:1-18). Clearly Barnabas and
   Saul had to finance the tour themselves. It was Philippi that first
   gave money to Paul's campaigns. There were still heathen enough in
   Antioch, but the church approved the going of Barnabas and Saul, their
   very best.

   13:4 So they [autoi men oun]. They themselves indeed therefore. No
   contrast is necessary, though there is a slight one in verses 5, 6.
   Luke again refers to the Holy Spirit as the source of their authority
   for this campaign rather than the church at Antioch. Sent forth
   [ekpemphthentes]. Old verb from [ekpempO] and first aorist passive
   participle, but in the N.T. only here and Ac 17:10. Sailed
   [apepleusan]. Effective aorist active indicative of [apopleO], old verb
   to sail away, depart from. In the N.T. only here and 14:26; 20:15;
   27:1. Barnabas was from Cyprus where there were many Jews.

   13:5 Proclaimed [kateggellon]. Imperfect active of [kataggellO],
   inchoative, began to proclaim. This was Paul's rule of procedure, "to
   the Jew first" (Ro 1:16; Ac 13:46; 17:2; 18:4,19; 19:8). They had also
   [eichon de kai]. Imperfect active, descriptive. As their attendant
   [hupereten]. Literally, "under-rower" [hupo, eretes] in the trireme.
   Probably here minister [chazzan] or assistant in the synagogue as in Lu
   4:20. Cf. Mt 5:25. It is not clear what John Mark did, though he was
   evidently selected by Barnabas as his cousin. He may have helped in the
   baptizing. There were probably others also in the company (verse 13).
   The "also" may mean that Mark did some preaching. Barnabas was probably
   the leader in the work in these Jewish synagogues.

   13:6 Unto Paphos [achri Paphou]. The new Paphos at the other end of the
   island, reached by a fine Roman road, some eight miles north of the old
   Paphos famous for the worship of Venus. A certain sorcerer, a false
   prophet, a Jew [andra tina magon pseudopropheten Ioudaion]. Literally,
   "a certain man" [andra tina] with various descriptive epithets. The
   word [magon] does not necessarily mean "sorcerer," but only a [magus]
   (Mt 2:1, 7, 10 which see). The bad sense occurs in Ac 8:9, 11 (Simon
   Magus) and is made plain here by "false prophet." In verse 8 here
   Barjesus (Son of Jesus) is called "Elymas the sorcerer (or Magian),"
   probably his professional title, as Luke interprets the Arabic or
   Aramaic word Elymas. These Jewish mountebanks were numerous and had
   great influence with the uneducated. In Ac 19:13 the seven sons of
   Sceva, Jewish exorcists, tried to imitate Paul. If one is surprised
   that a man like Sergius Paulus should fall under the influence of this
   fraud, he should recall what Juvenal says of the Emperor Tiberius
   "sitting on the rock of Capri with his flock of Chaldaeans around him."

   13:7 With the proconsul Sergius Paulus [sun tOi anthupatOi SergiOi
   PaulOi]. Luke used to be sharply criticized for applying this term to
   Sergius Paulus on the ground that Cyprus was a province under the
   appointment of the emperor with the title of propraetor and not under
   the control of the senate with the title of proconsul. That was true
   B.C. 30, but five years later it was changed to proconsul by Augustus
   and put under the control of the Senate. Two inscriptions have been
   found with the date A.D. 51 and 52 with the names of proconsuls of
   Cyprus and one is in the Cesnola Collection, an inscription found at
   Soli with the name of Paulus as Proconsul, undoubtedly this very man,
   though no date occurs. A man of understanding [andri sunetOi]. All the
   more amazing that he should be a victim of Barjesus. He had given up
   idolatry at any rate and was eager to hear Barnabas and Saul.

   13:8 Withstood them [anthistato autois]. Imperfect middle of
   [anthistemi], to stand against (face to face). Dative case [autois]. He
   persisted in his opposition and was unwilling to lose his great prize.
   There may have been a public discussion between Elymas and Saul. To
   turn aside [diastrepsai]. First aorist active infinitive of
   [diastrephO], old verb to turn or twist in two, to distort, to pervert
   (cf. Mt 17:17; Lu 23:2).

   13:9 But Saul, who is also called Paul [Saulos de, ho kai Paulos]. By
   this remarkably brief phrase Luke presents this epoch in the life of
   Saul Paul. The "also" [kai] does not mean that the name Paul was given
   now for the first time, rather than he had always had it. As a Jew and
   a Roman citizen, he undoubtedly had both names all the time (cf. John
   Mark, Symeon Niger, Barsabbas Justus). Jerome held that the name of
   Sergius Paulus was adopted by Saul because of his conversion at this
   time, but this is a wholly unlikely explanation, "an element of
   vulgarity impossible to St. Paul " (Farrar). Augustine thought that the
   meaning of the Latin paulus (little) would incline Saul to adopt, "but
   as a proper name the word rather suggested the glories of the Aemilian
   family, and even to us recalls the name of another Paulus, who was
   lavish of his noble life'" (Page). Among the Jews the name Saul was
   naturally used up to this point, but from now on Luke employs Paul save
   when there is a reference to his previous life (Ac 22:7; 26:14). His
   real career is work among the Gentiles and Paul is the name used by
   them. There is a striking similarity in sound between the Hebrew Saul
   and the Roman Paul. Paul was proud of his tribe of Benjamin and so of
   King Saul (Php 3:5). Filled with the Holy Spirit [plestheis pneumatos
   hagiou]. First aorist (ingressive) passive participle of [pimplemi]
   with the genitive case. A special influx of power to meet this
   emergency. Here was a cultured heathen, typical of the best in Roman
   life, who called forth all the powers of Paul plus the special help of
   the Holy Spirit to expose the wickedness of Elymas Barjesus. If one
   wonders why the Holy Spirit filled Paul for this emergency rather than
   Barnabas, when Barnabas was named first in 13:2, he can recall the
   sovereignty of the Holy Spirit in his choice of agents (1Co 12:4-11)
   and also the special call of Paul by Christ (Ac 9:15; 26:17f.).
   Fastened his eyes [atenisas]. As already in Lu 4:20; 22:56; Ac 3:4, 12;
   6:15; 10:4.

   13:10 Of all guile [pantos dolou]. From [delO], to catch with bait, old
   word, already seen in Mt 26:4; Mr 7:22; 14:1. Paul denounces Elymas as
   a trickster. All villainy [pases rhaidiourgias]. Late compound from
   [rhaidiourgos] [rhaidios], easy, facile, [ergon], deed, one who does a
   thing adroitly and with ease). So levity in Xenophon and
   unscrupulousness in Polybius, Plutarch, and the papyri. Only here in
   the N.T., though the kindred word [rhaidiourgema] occurs in Ac 18:14.
   With deadly accuracy Paul pictured this slick rascal. Thou son of the
   devil [huie diabolou]. Damning phrase like that used by Jesus of the
   Pharisees in Joh 8:44, a slanderer like the [diabolos]. This use of son
   [huios] for characteristic occurs in Ac 3:25; 4:36, a common Hebrew
   idiom, and may be used purposely by Paul in contrast with the name
   Barjesus (son of Jesus) that Elymas bore (13:6). Enemy of all
   righteousness [echthre pases dikaiosunes]. Personal enemy to all
   justice, sums up all the rest. Note triple use of "all" [pantos, pases,
   pases], total depravity in every sense. Wilt thou not cease? [ou
   pausei]. An impatient rhetorical question, almost volitive in force
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 874). Note [ou], not [me], To pervert
   [diastrephOn]. Present active participle describing the actual work of
   Elymas as a perverter or distorter (see verse 8). More exactly, Wilt
   thou not cease perverting? The right ways of the Lord [tas hodous tou
   kuriou tas eutheias]. The ways of the Lord the straight ones as opposed
   to the crooked ways of men (Isa 40:4; 42:16; Lu 3:5). The task of John
   the Baptist as of all prophets and preachers is to make crooked paths
   straight and to get men to walk in them. This false prophet was making
   even the Lord's straight ways crooked. Elymas has many successors.

   13:11 Upon thee [epi se]. The use of [epi] with the accusative is rich
   and varied, the precise shade of meaning depending on the content. The
   "hand of the Lord" might be kindly (Ac 11:21) or hostile (Heb 10:31),
   but when God's hand touches one's life (Job 19:21) it may be in
   judgment as here with Elymas. He has not humbled himself under the
   mighty hand of God (1Pe 5:6). Not seeing [me blepOn]. Repeating with
   negative participle the negative idea in "blind" [tuphlos]. "It was a
   judicial infliction; blindness for blindness, darkness without for
   wilful darkness within" (Furneaux). He was an example of the blind
   leading the blind that was to cease and Sergius Paulus was to be led
   into the light. The blindness was to be "for a season" [achri kairou],
   Lu 4:13), if it should please God to restore his sight. Paul apparently
   recalls his own blindness as he entered Damascus. A mist [achlus].
   Especially a dimness of the eyes, old poetic word and late prose, in
   LXX, only here in N.T. Galen uses it of the opacity of the eye caused
   by a wound. He went about seeking some one to lead him by the hand
   [periagOn ezetei cheiragOgous]. A rather free rendering. Literally,
   "going about [periagOn], present active participle of [periagO] he was
   seeking [ezetei], imperfect active of [zeteO] guides [cheiragOgous],
   from [cheir], hand, and [agOgos], guide, from [agO], one who leads by
   the hand)." The very verb [cheiragOgeO], to lead by the hand, Luke uses
   of Paul in 9:8, as he entered Damascus.

   13:12 Believed [episteusen]. Ingressive aorist active indicative. Renan
   considers it impossible that a Roman proconsul could be converted by a
   miracle. But it was the teaching about the Lord [tou kuriou], objective
   genitive) by which he was astonished [ekplessomenos], present passive
   participle of [ekplessO], see on Mt 7:28) or struck out as well as by
   the miracle. The blindness came "immediately" [paraehrema] upon the
   judgment pronounced by Paul. It is possible that Sergius Paulus was
   converted to Christ without openly identifying himself with the
   Christians as his baptism is not mentioned as in the case of Cornelius.
   But, even if he was baptized, he need not have been deposed from his
   proconsulship as Furneaux and Rackham argue because his office called
   for "official patronage of idolatrous worship." But that could have
   been merely perfunctory as it probably was already. He had been a
   disciple of the Jewish magician, Elymas Barjesus, without losing his
   position. Imperial persecution against Christianity had not yet begun.
   Furneaux even suggests that the conversion of a proconsul to
   Christianity at this stage would have called for mention by the Roman
   and Greek historians. There is the name Sergia Paullina in a Christian
   cemetery in Rome which shows that one of his family was a Christian
   later. One will believe what he wills about Sergius Paulus, but I do
   not see that Luke leaves him in the category of Simon Magus who
   "believed" (8:13) for revenue only.

   13:13 Paul and his company [hoi peri Paulon]. Neat Greek idiom as in
   Plato, Cratylus 440 C [hoi peri Herakleiton]. On this idiom see
   Gildersleeve, Syntax, p. 264. It means a man and his followers, "those
   around Paul." Now Paul ranks first always in Acts save in 14:2; 15:12,
   25 for special reasons. Heretofore Saul (Paul) held a secondary
   position (9:27; 11:30; 13:1f.). "In nothing is the greatness of
   Barnabas more manifest than in his recognition of the superiority of
   Paul and acceptance of a secondary position for himself" (Furneaux).
   Set sail [anachthentes]. First aorist passive participle of [anagO].
   Thirteen times in the Acts and Lu 8:22 which see. They sailed up to sea
   and came down [katagO, katabainO] to land. So it looks. Departed from
   them [apochOresas ap' autOn]. First aorist active participle of
   [apochOreO], old verb to withdraw, go away from. In the N.T. only here
   and Mt 7:23; Lu 9:39. He is called John there as in verse 5 and Mark in
   15:39, though John Mark in 12:12, 25. This may be accidental or on
   purpose (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 317). Luke is silent on John's
   reasons for leaving Paul and Barnabas. He was the cousin of Barnabas
   and may not have relished the change in leadership. There may have been
   change in plans also now that Paul is in command. Barnabas had chosen
   Cyprus and Paul has led them to Perga in Pamphylia and means to go on
   into the highlands to Antioch in Pisidia. There were perils of many
   sorts around them and ahead (2Co 11:26), perils to which John Mark was
   unwilling to be exposed. Paul will specifically charge him at Antioch
   with desertion of his post (Ac 15:39). It is possible, as Ramsay
   suggests, that the mosquitoes at Perga gave John malaria. If so, they
   bit Paul and Barnabas also. He may not have liked Paul's aggressive
   attitude towards the heathen. At any rate he went home to Jerusalem
   instead of to Antioch, zu seiner Mutter (Holtzmann). It was a serious
   breach in the work, but Paul and Barnabas stuck to the work.

   13:14 Passing through [dielthontes]. It is not clear why Paul and
   Barnabas left Perga so soon nor why they went to Antioch in Pisidia.
   Ramsay suggests malaria that spurred them on to the hills after the
   desertion of John Mark. They preached at Perga on the return (14:25)
   and apparently hurried away now. Farrar thinks that the hot weather had
   driven the population to the hills. At any rate it is not difficult to
   imagine the perils of this climb over the rough mountain way from Perga
   to Pisidian Antioch to which Paul apparently refers in 2Co 11:26. Sat
   down [ekathisan]. Ingressive aorist active indicative, took their seats
   as visiting Jews, possibly in the seats of the rabbis (J. Lightfoot).
   Whether they expected to be called on or not, they were given the
   opportunity as prominent visitors. The Pisidian Antioch was really in
   Phrygia, but towards Pisidia to distinguish it from Antioch on the
   Maeander (Ramsay, Church in the Roman Empire, p. 25). It was a colony
   like Philippi and so a free city. If Paul is referring to South Galatia
   and not North Galatia in Ga 4:13 when he says that his preaching in
   Galatia at first was due to illness, then it was probably here at
   Pisidian Antioch. What it was we have no means of knowing, though it
   was a temptation in his flesh to them so severe that they were willing
   to pluck out their eyes for him (Ga 4:14f.). Opthalmia, malaria,
   epilepsy have all been suggested as this stake in the flesh (2Co 12:7).
   But Paul was able to preach with power whatever his actual physical
   condition was.

   13:15 After the reading of the law and the prophets [meta ten anagnOsin
   tou nomou kai tOn prophetOn]. The law was first read in the synagogues
   till B.C. 163 when Antiochus Epiphones prohibited it. Then the reading
   of the prophets was substituted for it. The Maccabees restored both.
   There was a reading from the law and one from the prophets in Hebrew
   which was interpreted into the Aramaic or the Greek Koine for the
   people. The reading was followed by the sermon as when Jesus was
   invited to read and to preach in Nazareth (Lu 4:16f.). For the service
   in the synagogue see Schuerer, History of the Jewish People, Div. II,
   Vol. II, pp. 79ff. It was the duty of the rulers of the synagogue
   [archisunagOgoi] to select the readers and the speakers for the service
   (Mr 5:22, 35-38; Lu 8:49; 13:14; Ac 13:15; 18:8,17). Any rabbi or
   distinguished stranger could be called on to speak. If ye have any word
   of exhortation for the people [ei tis estin en humin logos parakleseOs
   pros ton laon]. Literally, if there is among you any word of
   exhortation for the people. It is a condition of the first class and
   assumed to be true, a polite invitation. On "exhortation" [paraklesis]
   see 9:31. It may be a technical phrase used in the synagogue (Heb
   13:22; 1Ti 4:13).

   13:16 Paul stood up [anastas Paulos]. The Jewish custom was to sit
   while speaking (Lu 4:20), but the Greek and Roman was to stand (Ac
   17:22). It is possible as Lewin (Life of St. Paul, Vol. 1, p. 141)
   suggests that here Paul stepped upon the platform and then took his
   seat as he began to speak or he may have followed the Greek and Roman
   custom. Paul is the leader now and the more gifted speaker (Ac 14:12),
   so that he responds to the courteous invitation of the rulers.
   Beckoning [kataseisas]. First aorist active participle of [kataseiO],
   old verb to shake down, a dramatic gesture for quiet and order like
   Peter in 12:17 and Paul on the steps of the tower of Antonia (21:40).
   And ye that fear God [kai hoi phoboumenoi ton theon]. Evidently large
   numbers of these Gentiles like Cornelius in Caesarea were present. They
   offered Paul a great opportunity for reaching the purely pagan
   Gentiles. This (verses 16-41) is the first full report of a sermon of
   Paul's that Luke has preserved for us. He is now a practised preacher
   of the gospel that he began proclaiming at Damascus, that Jesus of
   Nazareth is the Messiah of promise and the Saviour of the whole world
   both Jew and Gentile if they will only believe on him and be saved. It
   is possible that Paul here based his sermon on the passages of the law
   and the prophets that had just been read. He uses two words from the
   LXX, one in verse 19 from De 1:31 [etrophophoresen] (as a
   nursing-father bare he them), the reading of many old MSS. and the one
   preferred by the American Committee, the other in verse 17 from Isa 1:2
   [hupsOsen] (exalted). At any rate it is clear that Paul spoke in Greek
   so that all could understand his sermon. He may have written out notes
   of this sermon afterwards for Luke. The keynotes of Paul's theology as
   found in his Epistles appear in this sermon. It is interesting to
   observe the steady growth of Paul's Christology as he faced the great
   problems of his day. Here we see Paul's gospel for the Jews and the
   God-fearers (Gentiles friendly to the Jews).

   13:17 Chose [exelexato]. First aorist middle (indirect), selected for
   himself. Israel was the chosen people. Exalted [hupsOsen]. From
   [hupsoO], late verb from [hupsos] so often used of Christ. When they
   sojourned [en tei paroikiai]. In the sojourn. Late word from [paroikos]
   (sojourner, dweller, Ac 7:6) common in LXX. In N.T. only here and 1Pe
   1:17. With a high arm [meta brachionos hupselou]. Vivid picture from
   the LXX (Ex 6:1, 6; De 5:15; Ps 136:12).

   13:18 Suffered he their manners [etropophoresen]. First aorist active
   indicative of [tropophoreO], late word from [tropos], manner, and
   [pherO], reading of Aleph B D and accepted by Westcott and Hort. But A
   C Sahidic Bohairic read [etrophophoresen] from [trophophoreO]
   [trophos], a nurse, and [pherO],) late word (II Macc. 7:27), probably
   correct word here and De 1:31.

   13:19 When he had destroyed [kathelOn]. Second aorist active participle
   of [kathaireO], to tear down, old verb. He gave them for an inheritance
   [katekleronomesen]. First aorist active indicative of the double
   compound verb [kata-klero-nomeO], late verb in LXX (Nu 34:18; De 3:28;
   Jos 14:1) and only here in the N.T., to distribute by lot, to
   distribute as an inheritance. This is the correct reading and not
   [kateklerodotesen] from [kataklerodoteO] of the Textus Receptus. These
   two verbs were confused in the MSS. of the LXX as well as here. For
   about four hundred and fifty years [hOs etesin tetrakosiois kai
   pentekonta]. Associative instrumental case with an expression of time
   as in 8:11; Lu 8:29 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 527). The oldest MSS.
   (Aleph A B C Vg Sah Boh) place these figures before "after these
   things" and so in verse 19. This is the true reading and is in
   agreement with the notation in 1Ki 6:1. The difficulty found in the
   Textus Receptus (King James Version) thus disappears with the true
   text. The four hundred and fifty years runs therefore from the birth of
   Isaac to the actual conquest of Canaan and does not cover the period of
   the Judges. See on Ac 7:6.

   13:20 And after these things [kai meta tauta]. That is, the time of the
   Judges then began. Cf. Jud 2:16. Until Samuel the prophet [heOs Samouel
   prophetou]. The terminus ad quem. He was the last of the judges and the
   first of the prophets who selected the first king (Saul) under God's
   guidance. Note the absence of the Greek article with [prophetou].

   13:21 They asked [eitesanto]. First aorist indirect middle indicative,
   they asked for themselves. They were tired of a theocracy. Cf. 1Sa 8:5;
   10:1. Paul mentions with pride that Benjamin was the tribe of Saul (his
   name also), but he does not allude to Saul's sin (Furneaux). For the
   space of forty years [ete tesserakonta]. Accusative of extent of time.
   Not in the O.T., but in Josephus, Ant. VI. 14, 9.

   13:22 When he had removed him [metastesas auton]. First aorist active
   participle of [methistemi], old verb to transfer, to transpose (note
   force of [meta]. This verb occurs in Lu 16:4 by the unjust steward
   about his removal from office. Cf. 1Sa 15:16. To be [eis]. As or for,
   Greek idiom like the Hebrew le, common in the LXX. A man after my heart
   [andra kata ten kardian mou]. The words quoted by Paul as a direct
   saying of God are a combination of Ps 89:20, 21; 1Sa 13:14 (the word of
   the Lord to Samuel about David). Knowling thinks that this free and
   rather loose quotation of the substance argues for the genuineness of
   the report of Paul's sermon. Hackett observes that the commendation of
   David is not absolute, but, as compared with the disobedient Saul, he
   was a man who did God's will in spite of the gross sin of which he
   repented (Ps 51). Note "wills" [thelemata], plural, of God.

   13:23 Of this man's seed [toutou apo tou spermatos]. Emphatic position
   of [toutou]. Of this one from the (his) seed. According to promise
   [kat' epaggelian]. This phrase in Ga 3:29; 2Ti 1:1. See the promise in
   2Sa 7:2; Ps 132:11; Isa 11:1, 10; Jer 23:5f.; Zec 3:8. In Zec 3:8 the
   verb [agO] is used of the sending of the Messiah as here. A Saviour
   Jesus [SOtera Iesoun]. Jesus is in apposition with Saviour (accusative
   case) and comes at the end of the sentence in contrast with "this man"
   (David) at the beginning. Paul goes no further than David because he
   suggests to him Jesus, descendant in the flesh from David. By "Israel"
   here Paul means the Jewish people, though he will later enlarge this
   promise to include the spiritual Israel both Gentile and Jew (Ro
   9:6f.).

   13:24 When John had first preached [prokeruxantos IOanou]. Literally,
   John heralding beforehand, as a herald before the king (Lu 3:3).
   Genitive absolute of first aorist active participle of [prokerussO],
   old verb to herald beforehand, here alone in the N.T., though Textus
   Receptus has it also in Ac 3:20. Before his coming [pro prosOpou tes
   eisodou autou]. Literally, before the face of his entering in (here act
   of entrance as 1Th 1:9, not the gate as in Heb 10:19). See Mal 3:1
   quoted in Mt 11:10 (Lu 7:27) for this Hebrew phrase and also Lu 1:76.
   The baptism of repentance [baptisma metanoias]. Baptism marked by,
   characterized by (genitive case, case of kind or species) repentance
   (change of mind and life). The very phrase used of John's preaching in
   Mr 1:4; Lu 3:3. It is clear therefore that Paul understood John's
   ministry and message as did Peter (Ac 2:38; 10:37).

   13:25 As John was fulfilling his course [hOs eplerou IOanes ton
   dromon]. Imperfect active of [pleroO], describing his vivid ministry
   without defining the precise period when John asked the question. Paul
   uses this word [dromos] (course) of his own race (Ac 20:24; 2Ti 4:7).
   What suppose ye that I am? [Ti eme huponoeite einai?] Note [ti]
   (neuter), not [tina] (masculine), what not who, character, not
   identity. It is indirect discourse (the infinitive [einai] and the
   accusative of general reference). HuponoeO [hupo, noeO] is to think
   secretly, to suspect, to conjecture. I am not he [ouk eimi egO]. These
   precise words are not given in the Gospels, but the idea is the same as
   the disclaimers by the Baptist in Joh 1:19-27 (cf. also Mt 3:11; Mr
   1:7; Lu 3:16). Paul had a true grasp of the message of the Baptist. He
   uses the very form [l-sai] (first aorist active infinitive of [luO]
   found in Mr 1:7; Lu 3:16 and the word for shoes [hupodema], singular)
   in all three. His quotation is remarkably true to the words in the
   Synoptic Gospels. How did Paul get hold of the words of the Baptist so
   clearly?

   13:26 To us [hemin]. Both Jews and Gentiles, both classes in Paul's
   audience, dative of advantage. Is sent forth [exapestale]. Second
   aorist passive indicative of the double compound verb [exapostellO],
   common verb to send out [ex] and forth [apo]. It is a climacteric or
   culminative aorist tense. It has come to us in one day, this glorious
   promise. The word of this salvation [ho logos tes sOterias tautes]. The
   message of Jesus as Saviour (verse 23), long ago promised and now come
   to us as Saviour.

   13:27 Because they knew him not [touton agnoesantes]. First aorist
   active participle (causal) of [agnoeO], old verb, not to know. Peter
   gives "ignorance" [agnoia] as the excuse of the Jews in the death of
   Christ (3:17) and Paul does the same about his conduct before his
   conversion (1Ti 1:13). This ignorance mitigated the degree of their
   guilt, but it did not remove it, for it was willing ignorance and
   prejudice. The voices of the prophets which are read [tas phOnas tOn
   prophetOn tas anaginOskomenas]. Object also of [agnoesantes], though it
   could be the object of [eplerOsan] (fulfilled) if [kai] is taken as
   "also". The "voices" were heard as they were read aloud each Sabbath in
   the synagogue. In their ignorant condemnation they fulfilled the
   prophecies about the suffering Messiah.

   13:28 Though they found no cause of death [medemian aitian thanatou
   heurontes]. Second aorist active with usual negative of the participle.
   As a matter of fact the Sanhedrin did charge Jesus with blasphemy, but
   could not prove it (Mt 26:65; 27:24; Lu 23:22). At this time no Gospel
   had probably been written, but Paul knew that Jesus was innocent. He
   uses this same idiom about his own innocence (Ac 28:18). That he should
   be slain [anairethenai auton]. First aorist passive infinitive, the
   accusative case, the direct object of [eitesanto] (first aorist middle
   indicative, asked as a favour to themselves).

   13:29 From the tree [apo tou xulou]. Not here strictly a tree, but wood
   as already in 5:30; 10:29 and later in Ga 3:13. Strictly speaking, it
   was Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus who took the body of Jesus down
   from the cross, though the Jews had asked Pilate to have the bones of
   Jesus broken that his body should not remain on the cross during the
   Sabbath (Joh 19:31). Paul does not distinguish the details here. Laid
   [ethekan]. First (kappa) aorist active indicative third plural of
   [tithemi] in place of [ethesan] the usual second aorist active plural
   form. Tomb [mnemeion]. Memorial, common in the Gospels.

   13:30 But God raised him from the dead [ho de theos egeiren ek nekrOn].
   This crucial fact Paul puts sharply as he always did.

   13:31 Was seen for many days [Ophthe epi hemeras pleious]. The common
   verb (first aorist passive indicative of [horaO], to see) for the
   appearance of the Risen Christ, the one used by Paul of his own vision
   of Christ (1Co 15:8), which is not reported by Luke here. For more days
   (than a few), the language means, forty in all (1:3). Of them that came
   up with him [tois sunanabasin autOi]. Dative (after [Ophthe] articular
   participle (second aorist active of [sunanabainO] with associative
   instrumental case [autOi], the very men who knew him best and who could
   not be easily deceived about the reality of his resurrection. But this
   fact rules Paul out on this point, for he had not fellowshipped with
   Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem. Who are now his witnesses [hoitines
   nun eisin martures autou]. The very point that Peter used to clinch his
   argument with such powerful effect (2:32; 3:15).

   13:32 We bring you good tidings of the promise [hemeis humas
   euaggelizometha ten epaggelian]. Two accusatives here (person and
   thing), old Greek did not use accusative of the person with this verb
   as in 16:10; Lu 3:18. Note "we you" together. Here the heart of Paul's
   message on this occasion.

   13:33 Hath fulfilled [ekpeplerOken]. Hath filled out [ek]. Unto our
   children [tois teknois hemOn]. The MSS. vary greatly here about [hemOn]
   (our), some have [autOn], some [autOn hemin]. Westcott and Hort
   consider these readings "a primitive error" for [hemin] (to us) taken
   with [anastesas Iesoun] (having for us raised up Jesus). This raising
   up (from [anistemi], set up) as in 3:22; 7:37 refers not to
   resurrection (verse 34), but to the sending of Jesus (two raisings up).
   In the second psalm [en tOi psalmOi tOi deuterOi]. Ps 2:7. D has
   [prOtOi] because the first psalm was often counted as merely
   introductory.

   13:34 Now no more to return to corruption [meketi mellonta
   hupostrephein eis diaphthoran]. No longer about to return as Lazarus
   did. Jesus did not die again and so is the first fruits of the
   resurrection (1Co 15:23; Ro 6:9). He hath spoken [eireken]. Present
   perfect active indicative, common way of referring to the permanent
   utterances of God which are on record in the Scriptures. The holy and
   sure blessings of David [ta hosia Daueid ta pista]. See 2Sa 7:13.
   Literally, "the holy things of David the trustworthy things." He
   explains "the holy things" at once.

   13:35 Because [dioti]. Compound conjunction [dia, hoti] like our
   "because that." The reason for the previous statement about "the holy
   things." Thou wilt not give thy holy one to see corruption [ou dOseis
   ton hosion sou idein diaphthoran]. Quotation from Ps 16:10 to show that
   Jesus did not see corruption in his body, a flat contradiction for
   those who deny the bodily resurrection of Jesus.

   13:36 His own generation [idiai geneai]. Either locative case, "in his
   own generation" or dative object of [huperetesas] (served). The counsel
   of God [tei tou theou boulei]. So here, either the dative, the object
   of [huperetesas] if [geneai] is locative, or the instrumental case "by
   the counsel of God" which again may be construed either with
   [huperetesas] (having served) or after [ekoimethe] (fell on sleep).
   Either of the three ways is grammatical and makes good sense.
   [Koimaomai] for death we have already had (Ac 7:60). So Jesus (Joh
   11:11) and Paul (1Co 15:6,51). Was laid [prosetethe]. Was added unto
   (first aorist passive indicative of [prostithemi]. See the verb in
   2:47; 5:14. This figure for death probably arose from the custom of
   burying families together (Ge 15:15; Jud 2:10). Saw corruption [eiden
   diaphthoran]. As Jesus did not (Ac 2:31) as he shows in verse 37.

   13:38 Through this man [dia toutou]. This very man whom the Jews had
   crucified and whom God had raised from the dead. Remission of sins
   [aphesis hamartiOn] is proclaimed [kataggelletai] to you. This is the
   keynote of Paul's message as it had been that of Peter at Pentecost
   (2:38; 5:31; 10:43). Cf. 26:18. This glorious message Paul now presses
   home in his exhortation.

   13:39 And by him every one that believeth is justified from all things,
   from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses [kai apo
   pantOn hOn ouk edunethete en nomOi MOuseOs dikaiothenai en toutOi pas
   ho pisteuOn dikaioutai]. This is a characteristic Greek sentence with
   the principal clause at the end and Pauline to the core. A literal
   rendering as to the order would be: "And from all the things from [apo]
   not repeated in the Greek, but understood, the ablative case being
   repeated) which ye were not able to be justified in this one every one
   who believes is justified." The climax is at the close and gives us the
   heart of Paul's teaching about Christ. "We have here the germ of all
   that is most characteristic in Paul's later teaching. It is the
   argument of the Epistle to Galatians and Romans in a sentence"
   (Furneaux). The failure of the Mosaic law to bring the kind of
   righteousness that God demands is stated. This is made possible in and
   by [en] Christ alone. Paul's favourite words occur here, [pisteuO],
   believe, with which [pistis], faith, is allied, [dikaioO], to set right
   with God on the basis of faith. In Ro 6:7 Paul uses [apo] also after
   [dikaioO]. These are key words [pisteuO] and [dikaioO] in Paul's
   theology and call for prolonged and careful study if one is to grasp
   the Pauline teaching. [DikaioO] primarily means to make righteous, to
   declare righteous like [axioO], to deem worthy [axios]. But in the end
   Paul holds that real righteousness will come (Ro 6-8) to those whom God
   treats as righteous (Ro 3-5) though both Gentile and Jew fall short
   without Christ (Ro 1-3). This is the doctrine of grace that will prove
   a stumbling block to the Jews with their ceremonial works and
   foolishness to the Greeks with their abstract philosophical ethics (1Co
   1:23-25). It is a new and strange doctrine to the people of Antioch.

   13:40 Beware therefore [blepete oun]. The warning is pertinent. Perhaps
   Paul noticed anger on the faces of some of the rabbis. Lest there come
   upon you [me epelthei]. Second aorist active subjunctive with the
   negative final conjunction [me]. In the prophets [en tois prophetais].
   The quotation is from the LXX text of Hab 1:5. The plural here refers
   to the prophetic collection (Lu 24:44; Ac 24:14). "The Jews of
   Habakkuk's day had refused to believe in the impending invasion by the
   Chaldeans, and yet it had come" (Furneaux).

   13:41 Ye despisers [hoi kataphronetai]. Not in the Hebrew, but in the
   LXX. It is pertinent for Paul's purpose. Perish [aphanisthete]. Or
   vanish away. First aorist passive imperative. Added by the LXX to the
   Hebrew. If one declare it unto you [ean tis ekdiegetai humin].
   Condition of third class with present middle subjunctive, if one keep
   on outlining (double compound, [ek-di-egeomai] it unto you. Paul has
   hurled a thunderbolt at the close.

   13:42 And as they went out [ExiontOn de autOn]. Genitive absolute with
   present active participle of [exeimi], to go out, old verb, in the N.T.
   only in Ac 12:42; 17:15; 20:7; 27:43. As they (Paul and Barnabas) were
   going out with all the excitement and hubbub created by the sermon.
   They besought [parekaloun]. Imperfect active, inchoative, began to
   beseech. The Textus Receptus inserts wrongly [ta ethne] (the Gentiles)
   as if the Jews were opposed to Paul from the first as some doubtless
   were. But both Jews and Gentiles asked for the repetition of the sermon
   [lalethenai], first aorist passive infinitive object of [parekaloun]
   with accusative of general reference). The next Sabbath [eis to metaxu
   sabbaton]. Late use (Josephus, Plutarch, etc.) of [metaxu] [meta] and
   [xun] = [sun] in sense of after or next instead of between (sense of
   [meta] prevailing). Note use of [eis] for "on" or "by."

   13:43 When the synagogue broke up [lutheises tes sunagOges]. Genitive
   absolute of first aorist passive participle of [luO]. Apparently Paul
   and Barnabas had gone out before the synagogue was formally dismissed.
   Of the devout proselytes [tOn sebomenOn proselutOn]. Of the worshipping
   proselytes described in verses 16, 25 as "those who fear God" (cf.
   16:14) employed usually of the uncircumcised Gentiles who yet attended
   the synagogue worship, but the word [proselutoi] [pros, elutos] verbal
   from [erchomai], a new-comer) means usually those who had become
   circumcised (proselytes of righteousness). Yet the rabbis used it also
   of proselytes of the gate who had not yet become circumcised, probably
   the idea here. In the N.T. the word occurs only in Mt 23:15; Ac 2:10;
   6:5; 13:43. Many (both Jews and proselytes) followed [ekolouthesan],
   ingressive aorist active indicative of [akoloutheO] Paul and Barnabas
   to hear more without waiting till the next Sabbath. So we are to
   picture Paul and Barnabas speaking [proslalountes], late compound, in
   N.T. only here and 28:20) to eager groups. Urged [epeithon]. Imperfect
   active of [peithO], either descriptive (were persuading) or conative
   (were trying to persuade). Paul had great powers of persuasion (18:4;
   19:8, 26; 26:28; 28:23; 2Co 5:11; Ga 1:10). These Jews "were beginning
   to understand for the first time the true meaning of their national
   history" (Furneaux), "the grace of God" to them.

   13:44 The next Sabbath [tOi erchomenOi sabbatOi]. Locative case, on the
   coming [erchomenOi], present middle participle of [erchomai] Sabbath.
   So the best MSS., though some have [echomenOi] (present middle
   participle of [echO] in sense of near, bordering, following as in Lu
   13:33; Ac 29:15). Almost [schedon]. Old word, but in N.T. only here, Ac
   19:26; Heb 9:22. Was gathered together [sunechthe]. First aorist
   (effective) passive indicative of [sunagO], old and common verb. The
   "whole city" could hardly all gather in the synagogue. Perhaps Paul
   spoke in the synagogue and Barnabas to the overflow outside (see verse
   46). It was an eager and earnest gathering "to hear [akousai], first
   aorist active infinitive of purpose) the word of God" and a great
   opportunity for Paul and Barnabas. The Codex Bezae has it "to hear
   Paul." It was the new preacher (Paul) that drew the big crowd. It was a
   crowd such as will later hang on the words of John Wesley and George
   Whitfield when they preach Jesus Christ.

   13:45 The Jews [hoi Ioudaioi]. Certainly not the proselytes of verse
   43. Probably many of the Jews that were then favourably disposed to
   Paul's message had reacted against him under the influence of the
   rabbis during the week and evidently on this Sabbath very many Gentiles
   ("almost the whole city," "the multitudes" [tous ochlous] had gathered,
   to the disgust of the stricter Jews. Nothing is specifically stated
   here about the rabbis, but they were beyond doubt the instigators of,
   and the ringleaders in, the opposition as in Thessalonica (17:5). No
   such crowds [ochlous] came to the synagogue when they were the
   speakers. With jealousy [zelou]. Genitive case of [zelos] (from [zeO],
   to boil) after [eplesthesan] (effective first aorist passive indicative
   of [pimplemi]. Envy and jealousy arise between people of the same
   calling (doctors towards doctors, lawyers towards lawyers, preachers
   towards preachers). So these rabbis boiled with jealousy when they saw
   the crowds gathered to hear Paul and Barnabas. Contradicted
   [antelegon]. Imperfect active of [antilegO], old verb to speak against,
   to say a word in opposition to [anti], face to face). It was
   interruption of the service and open opposition in the public meeting.
   Paul and Barnabas were guests by courtesy and, of course, could not
   proceed further, when denied that privilege. Blasphemed
   [blasphemountes]. Blaspheming. So the correct text without the addition
   [antilegontes] (repeated from [antelegon] above). Common verb in the
   Gospels for saying injurious and harmful things. Doubtless these rabbis
   indulged in unkind personalities and made it plain that Paul and
   Barnabas were going beyond the limitations of pure Judaism in their
   contacts with Gentiles.

   13:46 Spake out boldly [parresiasamenoi]. First aorist middle
   participle of [parresiazomai], to use freedom in speaking, to assume
   boldness. Both Paul and Barnabas accepted the challenge of the rabbis.
   They would leave their synagogue, but not without a word of
   explanation. It was necessary to you first [Humin en anagkaion prOton].
   They had done their duty and had followed the command of Jesus (1:8).
   They use the very language of Peter in 3:26 [humin prOton] "to you
   first." This position Paul as the apostle to the Gentiles will always
   hold, the Jew first in privilege and penalty (Ro 1:16; 2:9, 10). Ye
   thrust it from you [apOtheisthe auton]. Present middle (indirect, from
   yourselves) indicative of [apOtheO], to push from. Vigorous verb seen
   already in Ac 7:27, 39 which see. Judge yourselves unworthy [ouk axious
   krinete heautous]. Present active indicative of the common verb
   [krinO], to judge or decide with the reflexive pronoun expressed.
   Literally, Do not judge yourselves worthy. By their action and their
   words they had taken a violent and definite stand. Lo, we turn to the
   Gentiles [idou strephometha eis ta ethne]. It is a crisis [idou], lo):
   "Lo, we turn ourselves to the Gentiles." Probably also aoristic
   present, we now turn (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 864-70). [Strephometha]
   is probably the direct middle (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 806-08) though
   the aorist passive [estraphen] is so used also (7:39). It is a dramatic
   moment as Paul and Barnabas turn from the Jews to the Gentiles, a
   prophecy of the future history of Christianity. In Ro 9-11 Paul will
   discuss at length the rejection of Christ by the Jews and the calling
   of the Gentiles to be the real (the spiritual) Israel.

   13:47 For so hath the Lord commanded us [houtOs gar entetaltai hemin ho
   kurios]. Perfect middle indicative of [entellO], poetic (Pindar) and
   late verb to enjoin (1:2). The command of the Lord Paul finds in Isa
   49:6 quoted by Simeon also (Lu 2:32). The conviction of Paul's mind was
   now made clear by the fact of the rejection by the Jews. He could now
   see more clearly the words of the prophet about the Gentiles: The
   Messiah is declared by God in Isaiah to be "a light to the Gentiles"
   [ethnOn], objective genitive), "a light for revelation to the Gentiles"
   [phOs eis apokalupsin ethnOn], Lu 2:32). So Paul is carrying out the
   will of God in turning to the Gentiles. He will still appeal to the
   Jews elsewhere as they allow him to do so, but not here. That thou
   shouldest be [tou einai se]. Genitive articular infinitive of purpose
   with the accusative of general reference. This is all according to
   God's fixed purpose [tetheika], perfect active indicative of [tithemi].
   Unto the uttermost part of the earth [heOs eschatou tes ges]. Unto the
   last portion (genitive neuter, not feminine) of the earth. It is a long
   time from Paul to now, not to say from Isaiah to now, and not yet has
   the gospel been carried to half of the people of earth. God's people
   are slow in carrying out God's plans for salvation.

   13:48 As the Gentiles heard this they were glad [akouonta ta ethne
   echairon]. Present active participle of [akouO] and imperfect active of
   [chairO], linear action descriptive of the joy of the Gentiles.
   Glorified the word of God [edoxazon ton logon tou theou]. Imperfect
   active again. The joy of the Gentiles increased the fury of the Jews.
   "The synagogue became a scene of excitement which must have been
   something like the original speaking with tongues" (Rackham). The joy
   of the Gentiles was to see how they could receive the higher blessing
   of Judaism without circumcision and other repellent features of Jewish
   ceremonialism. It was the gospel of grace and liberty from legalism
   that Paul had proclaimed. Whether Ga 4:13 describes this incident or
   not (the South Galatian theory), it illustrates it when Gentiles
   received Paul as if he were Christ Jesus himself. It was triumph with
   the Gentiles, but defeat with the Jews. As many as were ordained to
   eternal life [hosoi esan tetagmenoi eis zOen aiOnion]. Periphrastic
   past perfect passive indicative of [tassO], a military term to place in
   orderly arrangement. The word "ordain" is not the best translation
   here. "Appointed," as Hackett shows, is better. The Jews here had
   voluntarily rejected the word of God. On the other side were those
   Gentiles who gladly accepted what the Jews had rejected, not all the
   Gentiles. Why these Gentiles here ranged themselves on God's side as
   opposed to the Jews Luke does not tell us. This verse does not solve
   the vexed problem of divine sovereignty and human free agency. There is
   no evidence that Luke had in mind an absolutum decretum of personal
   salvation. Paul had shown that God's plan extended to and included
   Gentiles. Certainly the Spirit of God does move upon the human heart to
   which some respond, as here, while others push him away. Believed
   [episteusan]. Summary or constative first aorist active indicative of
   [pisteuO]. The subject of this verb is the relative clause. By no
   manner of legerdemain can it be made to mean "those who believe were
   appointed." It was saving faith that was exercised only by those who
   were appointed unto eternal life, who were ranged on the side of
   eternal life, who were thus revealed as the subjects of God's grace by
   the stand that they took on this day for the Lord. It was a great day
   for the kingdom of God.

   13:49 Was spread abroad [diephereto]. Imperfect passive of [diapherO],
   to carry in different directions [dia]. By the recent converts as well
   as by Paul and Barnabas. This would seem to indicate a stay of some
   months with active work among the Gentiles that bore rich fruit.
   Throughout all the region [di' holes tes chOras]. Antioch in Pisidia as
   a Roman colony would be the natural centre of a Roman Regio, an
   important element in Roman imperial administration. There were probably
   other Regiones in South Galatia (Ramsay, St. Paul the Traveller and
   Roman Citizen, pp. 102-12).

   13:50 Urged on [parOtrunan]. First aorist (effective) active of
   [par-otrunO], old verb, but here alone in the N.T., to incite, to stir
   up. The Jews were apparently not numerous in this city as they had only
   one synagogue, but they had influence with people of prominence, like
   "the devout women of honourable estate" [tas sebomenas gunaikas tas
   euschemonas], the female proselytes of high station, a late use of an
   old word used about Joseph of Arimathea (Mr 15:43). The rabbis went
   after these Gentile women who had embraced Judaism (cf. Ac 17:4 in
   Thessalonica) as Paul had made an appeal to them. The prominence of
   women in public life here at Antioch is quite in accord with what we
   know of conditions in the cities of Asia Minor. "Thus women were
   appointed under the empire as magistrates, as presidents of the games,
   and even the Jews elected a woman as Archisynagogos, at least in one
   instance at Smyrna" (Knowling). In Damascus Josephus (War II. 20, 21)
   says that a majority of the married women were proselytes. Strabo
   (VIII. 2) and Juvenal (VI. 542) speak of the addiction of women to the
   Jewish religion. The chief men of the city [tous prOtous tes poleOs].
   Probably city officials (the Duumviri, the Praetors, the First Ten in
   the Greek Cities of the east) or other "foremost" men, not officials.
   The rabbis were shrewd enough to reach these men (not proselytes)
   through the women who were proselytes of distinction. Stirred up a
   persecution [epegeiran diOgmon]. First aorist active indicative of
   [epegeirO], old verb, but in the N.T. only here and 14:2. Paul seems to
   allude to this persecution in 2Ti 3:11 "persecutions, sufferings, what
   things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, what persecutions I
   endured." Here Paul had perils from his own countrymen and perils from
   the Gentiles after the perils of rivers and perils of robbers on the
   way from Perga (2Co 11:26). He was thrice beaten with rods [tris
   erhabdisthen], 2Co 11:25) by Roman lictors in some Roman colony. If
   that was here, then Paul and Barnabas were publicly scourged by the
   lictors before they left. Probably the Jews succeeded in making the
   Roman officials look on Paul and Barnabas as disturbers of the public
   peace. So "they cast them out of their borders" [exebalon autous apo
   tOn horiOn autOn]. Second aorist active indicative of [ekballO],
   forcible expulsion plainly as public nuisances. Just a few days before
   they were the heroes of the city and now!

   13:51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them [Hoi de
   ektinaxamenoi ton koniorton tOn podOn ep' autous]. First aorist middle
   (indirect) participle of [ektinassO], to shake out or off. Homer uses
   it for knocking out teeth. In the papyri. The middle aorist participle
   occurs again in 18:6 and the active imperative with the dust of the
   feet in Mr 6:11 (Lu 10:11 has [apomassometha]. and Mt 10:14 (command of
   Jesus). It is a dramatic gesture that forbids further intercourse. "As
   a protest against the injustice which cast them out. The sandal was
   taken off and the dust shaken out as a symbolic token that the very
   soil of the country was defiling" (Furneaux). Unto Iconium [eis
   Ikonion]. About 45 miles southeast from Antioch in Pisidia, at the foot
   of the Taurus mountains. At various times it was reckoned also in
   Pisidia or Phrygia as well as Lycaonia, Phrygian in population and
   distinguished by Luke (Ac 14:6) from Lystra and Derbe, cities of
   Lycaonia. As compared with Antioch (a Roman colony) it was a native
   Phrygian town. When the province of Galatia was divided, Iconium became
   the capital of Lycaonia and eclipsed Antioch in Pisidia. Strictly
   speaking at this time Lystra and Derbe were cities of Lycaonia-Galatica
   while Iconium was in Phrygia-Galatica (all three in the Roman Province
   of Galatia). It was at the meeting place of several Roman roads and on
   the highway from east to west. It is still a large town Konieh with
   30,000 population.

   13:52 And the disciples [hoi te] or [hoi de mathetai]. The Gentile
   Christians in Antioch in Pisidia. Persecution had precisely the
   opposite effect to the intention of the Jews for they "were filled with
   joy and the Holy Spirit" [eplerounto charas kai pneumatos hagiou].
   Imperfect passive, they kept on being filled. It had been so before (Ac
   4:31; 8:4; 9:31; 12:24). The blood of the martyrs is still the seed of
   the church.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 14

   14:1 They entered together [kata to auto eiselthein]. Like [epi to
   auto] in 3:1. The infinitive [eiselthein] is the subject of [egeneto].
   So spake that [lalesai houtOs hOste]. Infinitive again parallel to
   [eiselthein]. With the result that, actual result here stated with
   [hOste] and the aorist infinitive [pisteusai] (Robertson, Grammar, pp.
   999f.) rather than [hOste] and the indicative like Joh 3:16. It was a
   tremendous first meeting.

   14:2 That were disobedient [hoi apeithesantes]. First aorist active
   articular participle, not the present [apeithountes] as the Textus
   Receptus has it. But the meaning is probably the Jews that disbelieved,
   rather than that disobeyed. Strictly [apeitheO] does mean to disobey
   and [apisteO] to disbelieve, but that distinction is not observed in
   Joh 3:36 nor in Ac 19:9; 28:24. The word [apeitheO] means to be
   [apeithes], to be unwilling to be persuaded or to withhold belief and
   then also to withhold obedience. The two meanings run into one another.
   To disbelieve the word of God is to disobey God. Made them evil
   affected [ekakOsan]. First aorist active indicative of [kakoO], old
   verb from [kakos], to do evil to, to ill-treat, then in later Greek as
   here to embitter, to exasperate as in Ps 105:32 and in Josephus. In
   this sense only here in the N.T. Evidently Paul preached the same
   message as in Antioch for it won both Jews and Gentiles, and displeased
   the rabbis. Codex Bezae adds here that "the chiefs of the synagogue and
   the rulers" brought persecution upon Paul and Barnabas just as was
   argued about Antioch. Outside the synagogue the Jews would poison the
   minds of the Gentiles against Paul and Barnabas. "The story of Thecla
   suggests a means, and perhaps the apostles were brought before the
   magistrates on some charge of interference with family life. The
   magistrates however must have seen at once that there was no legal case
   against them; and by a sentence of acquittal or in some other way the
   Lord gave peace" (Rackham). As we have it, the story of Paul and Thecla
   undoubtedly has apocryphal features, though Thecla may very well be an
   historical character here at Iconium where the story is located.
   Certainly the picture of Paul herein drawn cannot be considered
   authentic though a true tradition may underlie it: "bald, bowlegged,
   strongly built, small in stature, with large eyes and meeting eyebrows
   and longish nose; full of grace; sometimes looking like a man,
   sometimes having the face of an angel."

   14:3 Long time therefore [hikanon men oun chronon]. Accusative of
   duration of time (possibly six months) and note [men oun]. There is an
   antithesis in [eschisthe de] (verse 4) and in verse 5 [egeneto de].
   After the persecution and vindication there was a season of great
   opportunity which Paul and Barnabas used to the full, "speaking boldly"
   [parresiazomenoi] as in 13:46 at Antioch in Pisidia, "in the Lord" [epi
   tOi kuriOi], upon the basis of the Lord Jesus as in 4:17f. And the Lord
   Jesus "bore witness to the word of his grace" as he always does,
   "granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands" [didonti semeia
   kai terata ginesthai dia tOn cheirOn autOn]. Present participle
   [didonti] and present infinitive [ginesthai] repetition of both signs
   and wonders (note both words) just as had happened with Peter and John
   and the other apostles (2:43; 4:29f.; 5:12; cf. Heb 2:4). The time of
   peace could not last forever with such a work of grace as this. A
   second explosion of persecution was bound to come and some of the MSS.
   actually have [ek deuterou] (a second time).

   14:4 But the multitude of the city was divided [eschisthe de to plethos
   tes poleOs]. First aorist passive indicative of [schizO], old verb to
   split, to make a schism or factions as Sadducees and Pharisees (23:7).
   This division was within the Gentile populace. Part held [hoi men
   esan], literally "some were with the Jews" [sun tois Ioudaiois], part
   with the apostles [hoi de sun tois apostolois]. Common demonstrative of
   contrast [hoi men, hoi de], Robertson, Grammar, p. 694). The Jewish
   leaders made some impression on the Gentiles as at Antioch in Pisidia
   and later at Thessalonica (17:4f.). This is the first time in the Acts
   that Paul and Barnabas are termed "apostles" (see also verse 14).
   Elsewhere in the Acts the word is restricted to the twelve. Certainly
   Luke does not here employ it in that technical sense. To have followed
   Jesus in his ministry and to have seen the Risen Christ was essential
   to the technical use (1:22f.). Whether Barnabas had seen the Risen
   Christ we do not know, but certainly Paul had (1Co 9:1f.; 15:8). Paul
   claimed to be an apostle on a par with the twelve (Ga 1:1, 16-18). The
   word originally means simply one sent (Joh 13:16) like messengers of
   the churches with the collection (2Co 8:23). The Jews used it of those
   sent from Jerusalem to collect the temple tribute. Paul applies the
   word to James the Lord's brother (Ga 1:19), to Epaphroditus (Php 2:25)
   as the messenger of the church in Philippi, to Silvanus and Timothy
   (1Th 2:6; Ac 18:5), apparently to Apollos (1Co 4:9), and to Andronicus
   and Junias (Ro 16:6f.). He even calls the Judaizers "false apostles"
   (2Co 11:13).

   14:5 An onset [horme]. A rush or impulse as in Jas 3:4. Old word, but
   only twice in the N.T. (here and James). It probably denotes not an
   actual attack so much as the open start, the co-operation of both Jews
   and Gentiles (the disaffected portion), "with their rulers" [sun tois
   archousin autOn], that is the rulers of the Jewish synagogue (13:27).
   The city officials would hardly join in a mob like this, though Hackett
   and Rackham think that the city magistrates were also involved as in
   Antioch in Pisidia (13:50). To entreat them shamefully [hubrisai].
   First aorist active infinitive of [hubrizO], old verb to insult
   insolently. See on Mt 22:6; Lu 18:32. To stone [lithobolesai]. First
   aorist active infinitive of [lithoboleO], late verb from [lithobolos]
   [lithos], stone, [ballO], to throw) to pelt with stones, the verb used
   of the stoning of Stephen (7:58). See on Mt 21:35. The plan to stone
   them shows that the Jews were in the lead and followed by the Gentile
   rabble. "Legal proceedings having failed the only resource left for the
   Jews was illegal violence" (Rackham).

   14:6 They became aware of it [sunidontes]. Second aorist (ingressive)
   active participle of [sunoraO] [suneidon], old word to see together, to
   become conscious of as already in 12:12. In the N.T. only by Luke and
   Paul. Fled [katephugon]. Second aorist (effective) active indicative of
   [katapheugO], old verb, but in the N.T. only here and Heb 6:18. Paul
   and Barnabas had no idea of remaining to be stoned (lynched) by this
   mob. It is a wise preacher who always knows when to stand his ground
   and when to leave for the glory of God. Paul and Barnabas were
   following the directions of the Lord Jesus given to the twelve on their
   special tour of Galilee (Mt 10:23). Lystra and Derbe, cities of
   Lycaonia (still part of the Province of Galatia, though in another
   Regio), not far from the base of the Black Mountain. Professor Sterrett
   has apparently identified Lystra by an inscription about six hours (18
   miles) south-southwest from Iconium near the village Khatyn Serai and
   Derbe probably near the village Losta or Zosta though its location is
   really not known. Lystra had been made a colony in B.C. 6 and Derbe was
   the frontier city of the Roman empire in the southeast. These are the
   only cities mentioned, but they were of importance and show that Paul
   kept to his plan of going to centres of influence. The new imperial
   road from Antioch and Iconium reached these cities. The region round
   about [ten perichOron] was "a high table land, ill-watered, bleak, but
   suited for sheep pasture" (Page).

   14:7 And there they preached the gospel [kakei euaggelizomenoi esan].
   Periphrastic imperfect middle. We are to think of extensive
   evangelistic work perhaps with the assistance of disciples from Antioch
   and Iconium since Paul and Barnabas could not speak Lycaonian. [Kakei]
   is crasis for [kai ekei].

   14:8 At Lystra [en Lustrois]. Neuter plural as in 16:2; 2Ti 3:11 while
   feminine singular in 14:6, 21; 16:1. There was apparently no synagogue
   in Lystra and so not many Jews. Paul and Barnabas had to do open-air
   preaching and probably had difficulty in being understood by the
   natives though both Greek and Latin inscriptions were discovered here
   by Professor Sterrett in 1885. The incident narrated here (verses 8-18)
   shows how they got a real hearing among these rude heathen. There sat
   [ekatheto]. Imperfect middle of [kathemai]. Was sitting. This case is
   very much like that in 3:1-11, healed by Peter. Possibly outside the
   gate (verse 13) or some public place. Impotent in his feet [adunatos
   tois posin]. Old verbal, but only here in the N.T. in this sense except
   figuratively in Ro 15:1. Elsewhere it means "impossible" (Mt 19:26).
   Locative case. Common in medical writers in the sense of "impotent." So
   Tobit 2:10; 5:9. Had walked [periepatesen]. So best MSS., first aorist
   active indicative "walked," not [periepepatekei], "had walked" (past
   perfect active).

   14:9 The same [houtos]. Just "this one." Heard [ekouen]. Imperfect
   active, was listening to Paul speaking [lalountos]. Either at the gate
   or in the market place (17:17) Paul was preaching to such as would
   listen or could understand his Greek (Koine). Ramsay (St. Paul the
   Traveller, pp. 114, 116) thinks that the cripple was a proselyte. At
   any rate he may have heard of the miracles wrought at Iconium (verse 3)
   and Paul may have spoken of the work of healing wrought by Jesus. This
   man was "no mendicant pretender," for his history was known from his
   birth. Fastening his eyes upon him [atenisas autOi]. Just as in 13:9 of
   Paul and 1:10 which see. Paul saw a new hope in the man's eyes and
   face. He had faith [echei pistin]. Present active indicative retained
   in indirect discourse. To be made whole [tou sOthenai]. Genitive of
   articular first aorist passive infinitive (purpose and result combined)
   of [sOzO], to make sound and also to save. Here clearly to make whole
   or well as in Lu 7:50 (cf. Ac 3:16; 4:10).

   14:10 Upright [orthos]. Predicate adjective. In this sense Galen and
   Hippocrates frequently use [orthos] (erect, straight). Paul spoke in a
   loud [megalei] voice so that all could hear and know. He leaped up and
   walked [helato kai periepatei]. Rather, He leaped up with a single
   bound and began to walk. The second aorist middle indicative (with
   first aorist vowel [a] of [hallomai] (late verb, in papyri) and
   inchoative imperfect active of [peripateO], common verb to walk around.
   This graphic picture is concealed by the usual English rendering. It is
   possible that Luke obtained the vivid report of this incident from
   Timothy who may have witnessed it and who was probably converted during
   Paul's stay here (16:3). His father was a prominent Greek and his
   mother Eunice, possibly a widow, may have lived here with her mother
   Lois (2Ti 1:5).

   14:11 Lifted up their voice [eperan ten phOnen autOn]. First aorist
   active of [epairO]. In their excitement they elevated their voices. In
   the speech of Lycaonia [Lukaonisti]. Adverb from verb [lukaonizO], to
   use the language of Lycaonia found here alone, but formed regularly
   like [Ebraisti] (Joh 5:2), [Hellenisti] (Ac 21:37), [ROmaisti] (Joh
   19:20). Paul was speaking in Greek, of course, but the excitement of
   the crowd over the miracle made them cry out in their native tongue
   which Paul and Barnabas did not understand. Hence it was not till
   preparations for offering sacrifice to them had begun that Paul
   understood the new role in which he and Barnabas were held. In the
   likeness of men [homoiOthentes anthrOpois]. First aorist passive
   participle of [homoiO], to liken, with the associative instrumental
   case. In this primitive state the people hold to the old Graeco-Roman
   mythology. The story of Baucis and Philemon tells how Jupiter (Zeus)
   and Mercury (Hermes) visited in human form the neighbouring region of
   Phrygia (Ovid, Meta. VIII. 626). Jupiter (Zeus) had a temple in Lystra.

   14:12 They called [ekaloun]. Inchoative imperfect began to call.
   Barnabas, Jupiter [ton Barnaban Dia]. Because Barnabas was the older
   and the more imposing in appearance. Paul admits that he was not
   impressive in looks (2Co 10:10). And Paul, Mercury [ton de Paulon
   Hermen]. Mercury [Hermes] was the messenger of the gods, and the
   spokesman of Zeus. [Hermes] was of beautiful appearance and eloquent in
   speech, the inventor of speech in legend. Our word hermeneutics or
   science of interpretation comes from this word (Heb 7:2; Joh 1:38).
   Because he was the chief speaker [epeide autos en ho hegoumenos tou
   logou]. Paul was clearly "the leader of the talk." So it seemed a clear
   case to the natives. If preachers always knew what people really think
   of them! Whether Paul was alluding to his experience in Lystra or not
   in Ga 4:14, certainly they did receive him as an angel of God, as if
   "Mercury" in reality.

   14:13 Whose temple was before the city [tou ontos pro tes pOleOs]. The
   god (Zeus) is identified with his temple. He had a statue and temple
   there. Oxen and garlands [taurous kai stemmata]. Probably garlands to
   put on the oxen before they were slain. It was common to sacrifice
   bullocks to Jupiter and Mercury. Would have done sacrifice [ethelen
   thuein]. Imperfect indicative, wanted to offer sacrifice. He was
   planning to do it, and his purpose now became plain to Paul and
   Barnabas.

   14:14 Having heard [akousantes]. Such elaborate preparation "with the
   multitudes" [sun tois ochlois] spread rumours and some who spoke Greek
   told Paul and Barnabas. It is possible that the priest of Jupiter may
   have sent a formal request that the visiting "gods" might come out to
   the statue by the temple gates to make it a grand occasion. They rent
   their garments [diarrexantes]. First aorist active participle from
   [diarregnumi], old verb to rend in two. Like the high priest in Mt
   26:65 as if an act of sacrilege was about to be committed. It was
   strange conduct for the supposed gods! Sprang forth [exepedesan]. First
   aorist (ingressive) active indicative of [ekpedaO] (note [ek], old
   verb, here only in the N.T. It was all a sign of grief and horror with
   loud outcries [krazontes].

   14:15 Sirs [andres]. Literally, Men. Abrupt, but courteous. We also are
   men of like passions with you [kai hemeis homoiopatheis esmen humin
   anthrOpoi]. Old adjective from [homoios] (like) and [paschO], to
   experience. In the N.T. only here and Jas 5:17. It means "of like
   nature" more exactly and affected by like sensations, not "gods" at
   all. Their conduct was more serious than the obeisance of Cornelius to
   Peter (10:25f.). [Humin] is associative instrumental case. And bring
   you good tidings [euaggelizomenoi]. No "and" in the Greek, just the
   present middle participle, "gospelizing you." They are not gods, but
   evangelists. Here we have Paul's message to a pagan audience without
   the Jewish environment and he makes the same line of argument seen in
   Ac 17:21-32; Ro 1:18-23. At Antioch in Pisidia we saw Paul's line of
   approach to Jews and proselytes (Ac 13:16-41). That ye should turn from
   these vain things [apo toutOn tOn mataiOn epistrephein]. He boldly
   calls the worship of Jupiter and Mercury and all idols "vain" or empty
   things, pointing to the statues and the temple. Unto the living God
   [epi theon zOnta]. They must go the whole way. Our God is a live God,
   not a dead statue. Paul is fond of this phrase (2Co 6:16; Ro 9:26). Who
   made [hos epoiesen]. The one God is alive and is the Creator of the
   Universe just as Paul will argue in Athens (Ac 17:24). Paul here quotes
   Ps 146:6 and has Ge 1:1 in mind. See also 1Th 1:9 where a new
   allegiance is also claimed as here.

   14:16 In the generations gone by [en tais parOichemenais geneais].
   Perfect middle participle from [paroichomai], to go by, old verb, here
   alone in the N.T. Suffered [eiasen]. Constative aorist active
   indicative of [eaO] (note syllabic augment). Paul here touches God in
   history as he did just before in creation. God's hand is on the history
   of all the nations (Gentile and Jew), only with the Gentiles he
   withdrew the restraints of his grace in large measure (Ac 17:30; Ro
   1:24,26,28), judgment enough for their sins. To walk in their ways
   [poreuesthai tais hodois autOn]. Present middle infinitive, to go on
   walking, with locative case without [en]. This philosophy of history
   does not mean that God was ignorant or unconcerned. He was biding his
   time in patience.

   14:17 And yet [kaitoi]. Old Greek compound particle [kai toi]. In the
   N.T. twice only, once with finite verb as here, once with the
   participle (Heb 4:3). Without witness [amarturon]. Old adjective [a]
   privative and [martus], witness), only here in the N.T. Left [apheken].
   First aorist active [k] aorist indicative of [aphiemi]. In that he did
   good [agathourgOn]. Present active causal participle of [agathourgeO],
   late and rare verb (also [agathoergeO] 1Ti 6:18), reading of the oldest
   MSS. here for [agathopoieO], to do good. Note two other causal
   participles here parallel with [agathourgOn], viz., [didous] ("giving
   you") present active of [didOmi, empiplOn] ("filling") present active
   of [empimplaO] (late form of [empimplemi]. This witness to God (his
   doing good, giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with
   food and gladness) they could receive without the help of the Old
   Testament revelation (Ro 1:20). Zeus was regarded as the god of rain
   (Jupiter Pluvius) and Paul claims the rain and the fruitful
   [karpophorous, karpos], and [pherO], fruit bearing, old word, here
   alone in N.T.) seasons as coming from God. Lycaonia was often dry and
   it would be an appropriate item. "Mercury, as the God of merchandise,
   was also the dispenser of food" (Vincent). Paul does not talk about
   laws of nature as if they governed themselves, but he sees the living
   God "behind the drama of the physical world" (Furneaux). These simple
   country people could grasp his ideas as he claims everything for the
   one true God. Gladness [euphrosunes]. Old word from [euphrOn] [eu] and
   [phren], good cheer. In the N.T. only Ac 2:28 and here. Cheerfulness
   should be our normal attitude when we consider God's goodness. Paul
   does not here mention Christ because he had the single definite purpose
   to dissuade them from worshipping Barnabas and himself.

   14:18 Scarce [molis]. Adverb in same sense as old [mogis], from
   [molos], toil. Restrained [katepausan]. Effective first aorist active
   indicative of [katapauO], old verb in causative sense to make abstain
   from. From doing sacrifice unto them [tou me thuein autois]. Ablative
   case of the articular infinitive with redundant negative after
   [katepausan], regular Greek idiom (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1094, 1171).
   It had been a harrowing and well-nigh a horrible ordeal, but finally
   Paul had won. If only nobody else had interposed!

   14:19 But there came thither Jews from Antioch and Iconium [Epelthan de
   apo Antiocheias kai Ikoniou Ioudaioi]. Came to or upon them,
   [epelthan], second aorist (ingressive) indicative of [eperchomai].
   Whether news of the miracle had reached those cities we do not know.
   These may have been travelling grain merchants. At any rate there was
   an interval in which Paul and Barnabas won some disciples (verse 22).
   There would be a natural reaction, even revulsion, in the minds of many
   who had come so near to worshipping Paul and Barnabas. The pendulum
   swings easily from one extreme to the other. The hostile Jews from
   Antioch and Iconium may even have followed Paul and Barnabas along the
   fine Roman road on purpose to keep them on the run. They had driven
   them out of Antioch and out of Iconium and now appear at Lystra at an
   opportune moment for their work. Having persuaded the multitudes
   [peisantes tous ochlous]. First aorist (effective) active participle of
   [peithO]. They had complete success with many and struck at the
   psychological moment. They stoned Paul [lithasantes ton Paulon]. First
   aorist active participle of [lithazO], late verb from [lithos] for
   throwing stones (used by Paul referring to this one incident when alone
   he was stoned, 2Co 11:25). The wounds inflicted may have left some of
   the scars [stigmata] mentioned in Ga 6:17. They stoned Paul as the
   chief speaker (Mercury) and passed by Barnabas (Jupiter). It was a
   Jewish mode of punishment as against Stephen and these Jews knew that
   Paul was the man that they had to deal with. Hackett notes that the
   Jews with two exceptions incited the persecutions which Paul endured.
   The exceptions were in Philippi (16:16-40) and Ephesus (19:23-41).
   Dragged him out of the city [esuron exO tes poleOs]. They hurled
   Stephen outside of the city before stoning him [7:58]. It was a hurried
   and irregular proceeding, but they were dragging (imperfect active of
   [surO], old verb) Paul out now. Supposing that he were dead [nomizontes
   auton tethnekenai]. Present active participle with infinitive (second
   perfect active of [thneskO] in indirect discourse with accusative of
   general reference. The Jews are jubilant this time with memories of
   Paul's escape at Antioch and Iconium. The pagan mob feel that they have
   settled accounts for their narrow escape from worshipping two Jewish
   renegade preachers. It was a good day's work for them all. Luke does
   not say that Paul was actually dead.

   14:20 Stood round about him [kuklOsantOn auton]. Genitive absolute with
   first aorist active participle of [kukloO], old verb from [kuklos]
   (circle, cycle) to make a circle round, to encircle. The would-be
   murderers left and a group of disciples gathered round to see if Paul
   was dead or alive and, if dead, to bury him. In that group Timothy may
   very well have been along with Eunice and Barnabas. Timothy, a lad of
   about fifteen, would not soon forget that solemn scene (2Ti 3:11). But
   Paul suddenly (apparently a miraculous recovery) rose up [anastas] and
   entered the city to the surprise and joy of the disciples who were
   willing to brave persecution with Paul. With Barnabas [sun tOi
   Barnabai]. With the assistance of Barnabas. It was plainly unwise to
   continue in Lystra so that they set out on the next day [tei epaurion],
   ten times in Acts), shaken and bruised as Paul was. Derbe was some
   forty miles distant, near the pass to the Cilician Gates.

   14:21 When they had preached the gospel to that city [euaggelisamenoi
   ten polin ekeinen]. Having evangelized (first aorist middle participle)
   that city, a smaller city and apparently with no trouble from the Jews.
   Had made many disciples [matheteusantes hikanous]. First aorist active
   participle of [matheteuO] from [mathetes], a learner or disciple. Late
   verb in Plutarch, to be a disciple (Mt 27:57 like Joh 19:38) and then
   to disciple (old English, Spenser), to make a disciple as in Mt 28:19
   and here. Paul and Barnabas were literally here obeying the command of
   Jesus in discipling people in this heathen city. They returned to
   Lystra and to Iconium, and to Antioch [hupestrepsan eis ten Lustran kai
   eis Ikonion kai eis Antiocheian]. Derbe was the frontier city of the
   Roman empire. The quickest way to return to Antioch in Syria would have
   been by the Cilician Gates or by the pass over Mt. Taurus by which Paul
   and Silas will come to Derbe in the second tour (Ac 15:41-16:1), but
   difficult to travel in winter. But it was necessary to revisit the
   churches in Lystra, Iconium, Antioch in Pisidia and to see that they
   were able to withstand persecution. Paul was a Roman citizen though he
   had not made use of this privilege as yet for his own protection.
   Against mob violence it would count for little, but he did not
   hesitate. Paul had been stoned in Lystra, threatened in Iconium,
   expelled in Antioch. He shows his wisdom in conserving his work.

   14:22 Confirming [episterizontes]. Late verb (in LXX), in N.T. only in
   Ac 14:22; 15:32, 41, to make more firm, to give additional [epi]
   strength. Each time in Acts the word is used concerning these churches.
   To continue in the faith [emmenein tei pistei]. To remain in with
   locative, old verb. It is possible that [pistis] here has the notion of
   creed as Paul uses it later (Col 1:23 with [epimenO]; 1Ti 5:8). It
   seems to be here more than trust or belief. These recent converts from
   heathenism were ill-informed, were persecuted, had broken family and
   social ties, greatly needed encouragement if they were to hold out. We
   must [dei hemas]. It does not follow from this use of "we" that Luke
   was present, since it is a general proposition applying to all
   Christians at all times (2Ti 3:12). Luke, of course, approved this
   principle. Knowling asks why Timothy may not have told Luke about
   Paul's work. It all sounds like quotation of Paul's very language. Note
   the change of construction here after [parakalountes] (infinitive of
   indirect command, [emmenein], but [hoti dei], indirect assertion). They
   needed the right understanding of persecution as we all do. Paul
   frankly warned these new converts in this heathen environment of the
   many tribulations through which they must enter the Kingdom of God (the
   culmination at last) as he did at Ephesus (Ac 20:20) and as Jesus had
   done (Joh 16:33). These saints were already converted.

   14:23 And when they had appointed for them elders in every church
   [cheirotonesantes de autois kat' ekklesian presbuterous]. They needed
   also some form of organization, though already churches. Note
   distributive use of [kata] with [ekklesian] (2:46; 5:42; Tit 1:5).
   [CheirotoneO] (from [cheirotonos], extending the hand, [cheir], hand,
   and [teinO], to stretch) is an old verb that originally meant to vote
   by show of the hands, finally to appoint with the approval of an
   assembly that chooses as in 2Co 8:19, and then to appoint without
   regard to choice as in Josephus (Ant. XIII. 2, 2) of the appointment of
   Jonathan as high priest by Alexander. So in Ac 10:41 the compound
   [procheiratoneO] is used of witnesses appointed by God. But the seven
   (deacons) were first selected by the Jerusalem church and then
   appointed [katastesomen] by the apostles. That is probably the plan
   contemplated by Paul in his directions to Titus (Tit 1:5) about the
   choice of elders. It is most likely that this plan was the one pursued
   by Paul and Barnabas with these churches. They selected the elders in
   each instance and Paul and Barnabas "ordained" them as we say, though
   the word [cheirotoneO] does not mean that. "Elders" were mentioned
   first in 11:30. Later Paul will give the requirements expected in these
   "elders" or "bishops" (Php 1:1) as in 1Ti 3:1-7; Tit 1:5-9. It is
   fairly certain that these elders were chosen to correspond in a general
   way with the elders in the Jewish synagogue after which the local
   church was largely copied as to organization and worship. Paul, like
   Jesus, constantly worshipped and spoke in the synagogues. Already it is
   plain, as at Antioch in Syria (11:26), that the Christians can no
   longer count on the use of the Jewish synagogue. They must have an
   organization of their own. The use of the plural here implies what was
   true at Philippi (Php 1:1) and Ephesus (Ac 20:17, 28) that each church
   (one in each city) "had its college of elders" (Hackett) as in
   Jerusalem (21:18). Elder [presbuteros] was the Jewish name and bishop
   [episkopos] the Greek name for the same office. "Those who are called
   elders in speaking of Jewish communities are called bishops in speaking
   of Gentile communities" (Hackett). Hovey rightly holds against Hackett
   that teaching was a normal function of these elders, pastors or bishops
   as they were variously called (1Ti 3:2; Tit 1:9; 1Co 12:28, 30; Eph
   4:11). Had prayed with fasting [proseuxamenoi meta nesteiOn]. It was a
   serious matter, this formal setting apart of these "elders" in the
   churches. So it was done in a public meeting with prayer and fasting as
   when Paul and Barnabas were sent forth from Antioch in Syria (13:3) on
   this mission tour. They commended them to the Lord [parethento autous
   tOi kuriOi]. Second aorist middle indicative of [paratithemi]. Old and
   solemn word, to entrust, to deposit as in a bank (1Ti 1:18; 2Ti 2:2).
   Cf. [paratheke] in 1Ti 6:20; 2Ti 1:12, 14. It was all that they could
   now do, to commit them to the Lord Jesus. Jesus used this word on the
   cross (Lu 22:32). On whom they had believed [eis hon pepisteukeisan].
   Past perfect indicative (without augment) of [pisteuO]. They had
   "trusted" in Jesus (2Ti 1:12) and Paul now "entrusts" them to him with
   confidence. It was a solemn and serious occasion in each instance as it
   always is to set apart men for the ministry. These men may not have
   been ideal men for this service, but they were the only ones available
   and they were chosen from the actual membership in each instance, men
   who knew local conditions and problems.

   14:24 When they had spoken the word in Perga [lalesantes en Pergei ton
   logon]. Now they stopped and preached in Perga which they had
   apparently not done before (see 13:13f.). After leaving Antioch they
   passed on through Pisidia, as if Antioch was not strictly in Pisidia
   (see on 13:14) and into Pamphylia. They crossed from Perga to Attaleia,
   the port of Perga, sixteen miles down the Cestus, and capital of
   Pamphylia, to find a ship for Antioch in Syria. It is now called Adala
   and for long was the chief harbour of the south coast of Asia Minor. We
   do not know why they did not revisit Cyprus, perhaps because no
   permanent Gentile churches were founded there.

   14:26 They sailed away to Antioch [apepleusan eis Antiocheian].
   Effective aorist active indicative of [apopleO], to sail off. They had
   been gone some eighteen months. They had been committed [esan
   paradedomenoi]. Periphrastic past perfect passive of [paradidOmi], old
   and common verb. High and serious thoughts filled the hearts of these
   first returned missionaries as they neared home. The grace of God had
   been with them. They had fulfilled [eplerOsan] the work to which they
   had been set apart by the Holy Spirit with the prayers of the Antioch
   church. They now had a wondrous story to tell.

   14:27 Gathered the church together [sunagagontes ten ekklesian]. Second
   aorist active participle of [sunagO]. It "was the first missionary
   meeting in history" (Furneaux). It was not hard to get the church
   together when the news spread that Paul and Barnabas had returned. "The
   suitability of the Gospel to become the religion of the world had not
   before been put to the test" (Furneaux). Doubtless many "wise-acres"
   had predicted failure as they did for William Carey and for Adoniram
   Judson and Luther Rice. Rehearsed [aneggellon]. Imperfect active. It
   was a long story for they had many things to tell of God's dealings
   "with them" [met' autOn] for God had been "with them" all the while as
   Jesus had said he would be (Mt 28:20, [meth' h-mOn]. Paul could recount
   some of the details given later in 2Co 11. And how [kai hoti]. Or "and
   that" in particular, as the upshot of it all. He had opened a door of
   faith unto the Gentiles [enoixen tois ethnesin thuran pisteOs]. Three
   times in Paul's Epistles (1Co 16:9; 2Co 2:12; Col 4:3) he employed the
   metaphor of "door," perhaps a reminiscence of the very language of Paul
   here. This work in Galatia gained a large place in Paul's heart (Ga
   4:14f.). The Gentiles now, it was plain, could enter the kingdom of God
   (verse 22) through the door of faith, not by law or by circumcision or
   by heathen philosophy or mythology.

   14:28 And they tarried no little time [dietribon de chronon ouk
   oligon]. Imperfect active of [diatribO], old verb to rub hard, to
   consume, with accusative of extent of time. It was a happy time of
   fellowship. The experiment entered upon by the church of Antioch was
   now a pronounced success. It was at the direct command of the Holy
   Spirit, but they had prayed for the absent missionaries and rejoiced at
   their signal success. There is no sign of jealousy on the part of
   Barnabas when Paul returns as the chief hero of the expedition. A new
   corner has been turned in the history of Christianity. There is a new
   centre of Christian activity. What will Jerusalem think of the new
   developments at Antioch? Paul and Barnabas made no report to Jerusalem.

Chapter 15

   15:1 And certain men came down from Judea [kai tines katelthontes apo
   tes Ioudaias]. Evidently the party of the circumcision in the church in
   Jerusalem (11:2) had heard of the spread of the gospel among the
   Gentiles in Cyprus, Pamphylia, and South Galatia (Phrygia, Pisidia,
   Lycaonia). Possibly John Mark after his desertion at Perga (13:13) told
   of this as one of his reasons for coming home. At any rate echoes of
   the jubilation in Antioch in Syria would be certain to reach Jerusalem.
   The Judaizers in Jerusalem, who insisted that all the Gentile
   Christians must become Jews also, had acquiesced in the case of
   Cornelius and his group (11:1-18) after plain proof by Peter that it
   was the Lord's doing. But they had not agreed to a formal campaign to
   turn the exception into the rule and to make Christianity mainly
   Gentile with a few Jews instead of mainly Jewish with a few Gentiles.
   Since Paul and Barnabas did not come up to Jerusalem, the leaders among
   the Judaizers decided to go down to Antioch and attack Paul and
   Barnabas there. They had volunteered to go without church action in
   Jerusalem for their activity is disclaimed by the conference (Ac
   15:24). In Ga 2:4 Paul with some heat describes these Judaizers as
   "false brethren, secretly introduced who sneaked in to spy out our
   liberty." It is reasonably certain that this visit to Jerusalem
   described in Ga 2:1-10 is the same one as the Jerusalem Conference in
   Acts 15:5-29 in spite of the effort of Ramsay to identify it with that
   in 11:29f. Paul in Galatians is not giving a list of his visits to
   Jerusalem. He is showing his independence of the twelve apostles and
   his equality with them. He did not see them in 11:29f., but only "the
   elders." In Ac 15 Luke gives the outward narrative of events, in Ga
   2:1-10 Paul shows us the private interview with the apostles when they
   agreed on their line of conduct toward the Judaizers. In Ga 2:2 by the
   use of "them" [autois] Paul seems to refer to the first public meeting
   in Acts before the private interview that came in between verses
   15:5-6. If we recall the difficulty that Peter had on the subject of
   preaching the gospel to the heathen (10:1-11:18), we can the better
   understand the attitude of the Judaizers. They were men of sincere
   convictions without a doubt, but they were obscurantists and unable and
   unwilling to receive new light from the Lord on a matter that involved
   their racial and social prejudices. They recalled that Jesus himself
   had been circumcised and that he had said to the Syro-Phoenician woman
   that he had come only save to the lost sheep of the house of Israel (Mt
   15:24ff.). They argued that Christ had not repealed circumcision. So
   one of the great religious controversies of all time was begun, that
   between spiritual religion and ritualistic or ceremonial religion. It
   is with us yet with baptism taking the place of circumcision. These
   self-appointed champions of circumcision for Gentile Christians were
   deeply in earnest. Taught the brethren [edidaskon tous adelphous].
   Inchoative imperfect active, began to teach and kept it up. Their
   attitude was one of supercilious superiority. They probably resented
   the conduct of Barnabas, who, when sent by the Church in Jerusalem to
   investigate the conversion of the Greeks in Antioch (11:20-26), did not
   return and report till a strong church had been established there with
   the help of Saul and only then with a big collection to confuse the
   issue. Paul and Barnabas were on hand, but the Judaizers persisted in
   their efforts to force their views on the church in Antioch. It was a
   crisis. Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot
   be saved [ean me peritmethete tOi ethei MOuseOs, ou dunasthe sOthenai].
   There was the dictum of the Judaizers to the Gentiles. Paul and
   Barnabas had been circumcised. This is probably the precise language
   employed, for they spoke in Greek to these Greeks. It is a condition of
   the third class (undetermined, but with prospect of being determined,
   [ean] plus the first aorist passive subjunctive of [peritemnO]. There
   was thus hope held out for them, but only on condition that they be
   circumcised. The issue was sharply drawn. The associative instrumental
   case [tOi ethei] is customary. "Saved" [sOthenai] here is the Messianic
   salvation. This doctrine denied the efficacy of the work of Christ.

   15:2 When Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning
   with them [Genomenes staseOs kai zeteseOs ouk oliges tOi PaulOi kai
   Barnabai pros autous]. Genitive absolute of second aorist middle
   participle of [ginomai], genitive singular agreeing with first
   substantive [staseOs]. Literally, "No little (litotes for much) strife
   and questioning coming to Paul and Barnabas (dative case) with them "
   [pros autous], face to face with them). Paul and Barnabas were not
   willing to see this Gentile church brow-beaten and treated as heretics
   by these self-appointed regulators of Christian orthodoxy from
   Jerusalem. The work had developed under the leadership of Paul and
   Barnabas and they accepted full responsibility for it and stoutly
   resisted these Judaizers to the point of sedition (riot, outbreak in Lu
   23:25; Ac 19:40) as in 23:7. There is no evidence that the Judaizers
   had any supporters in the Antioch church so that they failed utterly to
   make any impression. Probably these Judaizers compelled Paul to think
   through afresh his whole gospel of grace and so they did Paul and the
   world a real service. If the Jews like Paul had to believe, it was
   plain that there was no virtue in circumcision (Ga 2:15-21). It is not
   true that the early Christians had no disagreements. They had selfish
   avarice with Ananias and Sapphira, murmuring over the gifts to the
   widows, simony in the case of Simon Magus, violent objection to work in
   Caesarea, and now open strife over a great doctrine (grace vs.
   legalism). The brethren appointed [etaxan]. "The brethren" can be
   supplied from verse 1 and means the church in Antioch. The church
   clearly saw that the way to remove this deadlock between the Judaizers
   and Paul and Barnabas was to consult the church in Jerusalem to which
   the Judaizers belonged. Paul and Barnabas had won in Antioch. If they
   can win in Jerusalem, that will settle the matter. The Judaizers will
   be answered in their own church for which they are presuming to speak.
   The verb [etaxan] [tassO], to arrange) suggests a formal appointment by
   the church in regular assembly. Paul (Ga 2:2) says that he went up by
   revelation [kat' apokalupsin], but surely that is not contradictory to
   the action of the church. Certain others of them [tinas allous].
   Certainly Titus (Ga 2:1, 3), a Greek and probably a brother of Luke who
   is not mentioned in Acts. Rackham thinks that Luke was in the number.
   The apostles and elders [tous apostolous kai presbuterous]. Note one
   article for both (cf. "the apostles and the brethren" in 11:1).
   "Elders" now (11:30) in full force. The apostles have evidently
   returned now to the city after the death of Herod Agrippa I stopped the
   persecution.

   15:3 They therefore [hoi men oun]. Luke's favourite method of
   resumptive narrative as we have seen (11:19, etc.), demonstrative [hoi]
   with [men] (indeed) and [oun] (therefore). Being brought on their way
   by the church [propemphthentes hupo tes ekklesias]. First aorist
   passive participle of [propempO], old verb, to send forward under
   escort as a mark of honour as in 20:38; 21:5; 3Jo 1:6. They were given
   a grand send-off by the church in Antioch. Passed through [dierchonto].
   Imperfect middle describing the triumphal procession through both [te
   kai] Phoenicia and Samaria. The conversion [ten epistrophen]. The
   turning. They caused great joy [epoioun charan megalen]. Imperfect
   active. They were raising a constant paean of praise as they proceeded
   toward Jerusalem. Probably the Judaizers had gone on or kept still.

   15:4 Were received [paredechthesan]. First aorist passive indicative of
   [paradechomai], old verb, to receive, to welcome. Here it was a public
   reception for Paul and Barnabas provided by the whole church including
   the apostles and elders, at which an opportunity was given to hear the
   story of Paul and Barnabas about God's dealings with them among the
   Gentiles. This first public meeting is referred to by Paul in Ga 2:2 "I
   set before them [autois] the gospel, etc."

   15:5 But there rose up [exanestesan de]. Second aorist active
   indicative (intransitive). Note both [ex] and [an]. These men rose up
   out of the crowd at a critical moment. They were believers in Christ
   [pepisteukotes], having believed), but were still members of "the sect
   of the Pharisees" [tes haireseOs tOn PharisaiOn]. Evidently they still
   held to the Pharisaic narrowness shown in the attack on Peter (11:2f.).
   Note the dogmatism of their "must" [dei] after the opposition of Paul
   and Barnabas to their "except" [ean me] at Antioch (15:1). They are
   unconvinced and expected to carry the elders with them. Codex Bezae
   says that they had appealed to the elders (15:2, 5). At any rate they
   have made the issue in open meeting at the height of the jubilation. It
   is plain from verse 6 that this meeting was adjourned, for another
   gathering came together then. It is here that the private conference of
   which Paul speaks in Ga 2:1-10 took place. It was Paul's chance to see
   the leaders in Jerusalem (Peter, James, and John) and he won them over
   to his view of Gentile liberty from the Mosaic law so that the next
   public conference (Ac 15:6-29) ratified heartily the views of Paul,
   Barnabas, Peter, James, and John. It was a diplomatic triumph of the
   first order and saved Christianity from the bondage of Jewish
   ceremonial sacramentalism. So far as we know this is the only time that
   Paul and John met face to face, the great spirits in Christian history
   after Jesus our Lord. It is a bit curious to see men saying today that
   Paul surrendered about Titus and had him circumcised for the sake of
   peace, the very opposite of what he says in Galatians, "to whom I
   yielded, no not for an hour." Titus as a Greek was a red flag to the
   Judaizers and to the compromisers, but Paul stood his ground.

   15:6 Were gathered together [sunechthesan]. First aorist (effective)
   passive indicative. The church is not named here as in verse 4, but we
   know from verses 12-22 that the whole church came together this time
   also along with the apostles and elders. Of this matter [peri tou logou
   toutou]. Same idiom in 8:21; 19:38. They realized the importance of the
   issue.

   15:7 When there had been much questioning [polles zeteseOs genomenes].
   Genitive absolute with second aorist middle participle of [ginomai].
   Evidently the Judaizers were given full opportunity to air all their
   grievances and objections. They were allowed plenty of time and there
   was no effort to shut off debate or to rush anything through the
   meeting. Peter rose up [anastas Petros]. The wonder was that he had
   waited so long. Probably Paul asked him to do so. He was the usual
   spokesman for the apostles and his activities in Jerusalem were
   well-known. In particular his experience at Caesarea (Ac 10) had caused
   trouble here in Jerusalem from this very same party of the circumcism
   (Ac 11:1-18). It was fitting that Peter should speak. This is the last
   time that Peter appears in the Acts. A good while ago [aph' hemerOn
   archaiOn]. From ancient days. The adjective [archaios] is from [arche],
   beginning, and its actual age is a matter of relativity. So Mnason (Ac
   21:16) is termed "an ancient disciple." It was probably a dozen years
   since God "made choice" [exelexato] to speak by Peter's mouth to
   Cornelius and the other Gentiles in Caesarea. His point is that what
   Paul and Barnabas have reported is nothing new. The Judaizers made
   objection then as they are doing now.

   15:8 Which knoweth the heart [kardiognOstes]. Late word from [kardia]
   (heart) and [gnOstes] (known, [ginOskO]. In the N.T. only here and 1:24
   which see. Giving them the Holy Spirit [dous to pneuma to hagion]. And
   before their baptism. This was the Lord's doing. They had accepted
   (11:18) this witness of God then and it was true now of these other
   Gentile converts.

   15:9 He made no distinction between us and them [outhen diekrinen
   metaxu hemOn te kai autOn]. He distinguished nothing (first aorist
   active ind.) between (both [dia] and [metaxu] both [te kai] us and
   them. In the matter of faith and conversion God treated us Jews as
   heathen and the heathen as Jews. Cleansing their hearts by faith [tei
   pistei katharisas tas kardias autOn]. Not by works nor by ceremonies.
   Peter here has a thoroughly Pauline and Johannine idea of salvation for
   all both Jew and Greek. Cf. 10:15.

   15:10 Why tempt ye God? [ti peirazete ton theon;]. By implying that God
   had made a mistake this time, though right about Cornelius. It is a
   home-thrust. They were refusing to follow the guidance of God like the
   Israelites at Massah and Meribah (Ex 17:7; De 6:16; 1Co 10:9). That ye
   should put [epitheinai]. Second aorist active infinitive of
   [epitithemi], epexegetic, explaining the tempting. A yoke upon the neck
   [zugon epi ton trachelon]. Familiar image of oxen with yokes upon the
   necks. Paul's very image for the yoke of bondage of the Mosaic law in
   Ga 5:1. It had probably been used in the private interview. Cf. the
   words of Jesus about the Pharisees (Mt 23:4) and how easy and light his
   own yoke is (Mt 11:30). Were able to bear [ischusamen bastasai].
   Neither our fathers nor we had strength [ischuO] to carry this yoke
   which the Judaizers wish to put on the necks of the Gentiles. Peter
   speaks as the spiritual emancipator. He had been slow to see the
   meaning of God's dealings with him at Joppa and Caesarea, but he has
   seen clearly by now. He takes his stand boldly with Paul and Barnabas
   for Gentile freedom.

   15:11 That we shall be saved [sOthenai]. First aorist passive
   infinitive in indirect discourse after [pisteuomen]. More exactly, "We
   believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in like
   manner as they also." This thoroughly Pauline note shows that whatever
   hopes the Judaizers had about Peter were false. His doctrine of grace
   is as clear as a bell. He has lifted his voice against salvation by
   ceremony and ritualism. It was a great deliverance.

   15:12 Kept silence [esigesen]. Ingressive first aorist active of
   [sigaO], old verb, to hold one's peace. All the multitude became silent
   after Peter's speech and because of it. Hearkened [ekouon]. Imperfect
   active of [akouO], descriptive of the rapt attention, were listening.
   Unto Barnabas and Paul [Barnaba kai Paulou]. Note placing Barnabas
   before Paul as in verse 25, possibly because in Jerusalem Barnabas was
   still better known than Paul. Rehearsing [exegoumenOn]. Present middle
   participle of [exegeomai], old verb, to go through or lead out a
   narrative of events as in Lu 24:35; Ac 10:8 which see. Three times
   (14:27; 15:4, 12) Paul is described as telling the facts about their
   mission work, facts more eloquent than argument (Page). One of the
   crying needs in the churches is fuller knowledge of the facts of
   mission work and progress with enough detail to give life and interest.
   The signs and wonders which God had wrought among the Gentiles set the
   seal of approval on the work done through [dia] Barnabas and Paul. This
   had been Peter's argument about Cornelius (11:17). This same verb
   [exegesato] is used by James in verse 14 referring to Peter's speech.

   15:13 After they had held their peace [meta to sigesai autous].
   Literally, "after the becoming silent (ingressive aorist active of the
   articular infinitive) as to them (Barnabas and Paul, accusative of
   general reference)." James answered [apekrithe IakObos]. First aorist
   passive (deponent) indicative. It was expected that James, as President
   of the Conference, would speak last. But he wisely waited to give every
   one an opportunity to speak. The challenge of the Judaizers called for
   an opinion from James. Furneaux thinks that he may have been elected
   one of the twelve to take the place of James the brother of John since
   Paul (Ga 1:19) calls him apostle. More likely he was asked to preside
   because of his great gifts and character as chief of the elders.

   15:14 Hearken unto me [akousate mou]. Usual appeal for attention. James
   was termed James the Just and was considered a representative of the
   Hebraic as opposed to the Hellenistic wing of the Jewish Christians (Ac
   6:1). The Judaizers had doubtless counted on him as a champion of their
   view and did later wrongfully make use of his name against Peter at
   Antioch (Ga 2:12). There was instant attention when James began to
   speak. Symeon [SumeOn]. The Aramaic form of Simon as in 2Pe 2:1. This
   little touch would show his affinities with the Jewish Christians (not
   the Judaizers). This Aramaic form is used also in Lu 2:25, 34 of the
   old prophet in the temple. Possibly both forms (Symeon, Aramaic, and
   Simon, Greek) were current in Jerusalem. How [kathOs]. Strictly,
   "according as," here like [hos] in indirect discourse somewhat like the
   epexegetic or explanatory use in 3Jo 1:3. First [prOton]. Told by Peter
   in verse 7. James notes, as Peter did, that this experience of Barnabas
   and Paul is not the beginning of work among the Gentiles. Did visit
   [epeskepsato]. First aorist middle indicative of [episkeptomai], old
   verb to look upon, to look after, provide for. This same verb occurs in
   Jas 1:27 and is one of various points of similarity between this speech
   of James in Acts and the Epistle of James as shown by Mayor in his
   Commentary on James. Somehow Luke may have obtained notes of these
   various addresses. To take from the Gentiles a people for his name
   [labein ex ethnOn laon tOi onomati autou]. Bengel calls this egregium
   paradoxon, a chosen people [laon] out of the Gentiles [ethnOn]. This is
   what is really involved in what took place at Caesarea at the hands of
   Peter and the campaign of Barnabas and Paul from Antioch. But such a
   claim of God's purpose called for proof from Scripture to convince Jews
   and this is precisely what James undertakes to give. This new Israel
   from among the Gentiles is one of Paul's great doctrines as set forth
   in Ga 3; Ro 9-11. Note the use of God's "name" here for "the Israel of
   God" (Ga 6:16).

   15:15 To this agree [toutOi sumphOnousin]. Associative instrumental
   case [toutOi] after [sumphOnousin] (voice together with, symphony with,
   harmonize with), from [sumphOneO], old verb seen already in Mt 18:19;
   Lu 5:36; Ac 5:9 which see. James cites only Am 9:11, 12 from the LXX as
   an example of "the words of the prophets" [hoi logoi tOn prophetOn] to
   which he refers on this point. The somewhat free quotation runs here
   through verses 16-18 of Ac 15 and is exceedingly pertinent. The Jewish
   rabbis often failed to understand the prophets as Jesus showed. The
   passage in Amos refers primarily to the restoration of the Davidic
   empire, but also the Messiah's Kingdom (the throne of David his
   father," Lu 1:32).

   15:16 I will build again [anoikodomesO]. Here LXX has [anastesO].
   Compound [ana], up or again) of [oikodomeO], the verb used by Jesus in
   Mt 16:18 of the general church or kingdom as here which see. The
   tabernacle of David [ten skenen Daueid], a poetical figure of the
   throne of David (2Sa 7:12) now "the fallen tent" [ten peptOkuian],
   perfect active participle of [piptO], state of completion. The ruins
   thereof [ta katestrammena autes]. Literally, "the ruined portions of
   it." Perfect passive participle of [katastrephO], to turn down. It is a
   desolate picture of the fallen, torn down tent of David. I will let it
   up [anorthOsO]. Old verb from [anorthoO] [ana, orthos], to set upright.
   See on Lu 3:13 of the old woman whose crooked back was set straight.

   15:17 That the residue of men may seek after the Lord [hopOs an
   ekzetesOsin hoi kataloipoi tOn anthrOpOn ton kurion]. The use of
   [hopOs] with the subjunctive (effective aorist active) to express
   purpose is common enough and note [an] for an additional tone of
   uncertainty. On the rarity of [an] with [hopOs] in the Koine see
   Robertson, Grammar, p. 986. Here the Gentiles are referred to. The
   Hebrew text is quite different, "that they may possess the remnant of
   Edom." Certainly the LXX suits best the point that James is making. But
   the closing words of this verse point definitely to the Gentiles both
   in the Hebrew and the LXX, "all the Gentiles" [panta ta ethne]. Another
   item of similarity between this speech and the Epistle of James is in
   the phrase "my name is called" [epikekletai to onoma mou] and Jas 2:7.
   The purpose of God, though future, is expressed by this perfect passive
   indicative [epikekletai] from [epi-kaleO], to call on. It is a Jewish
   way of speaking of those who worship God.

   15:18 From the beginning of the world [ap' aiOnos]. Or, "from of old."
   James adds these words, perhaps with a reminiscence of Isa 45:21. His
   point is that this purpose of God, as set forth in Amos, is an old one.
   God has an Israel outside of and beyond the Jewish race, whom he will
   make his true "Israel" and so there is no occasion for surprise in the
   story of God's dealings with the Gentiles as told by Barnabas and Paul.
   God's eternal purpose of grace includes all who call upon his name in
   every land and people (Isa 2:1; Mic 4:1). This larger and richer
   purpose and plan of God was one of the mysteries which Paul will unfold
   in the future (Ro 16:25; Eph 3:9). James sees it clearly now. God is
   making it known [poiOn tauta gnOsta], if they will only be willing to
   see and understand. It was a great deliverance that James had made and
   it exerted a profound influence on the assembly.

   15:19 Wherefore [dio]. "Because of which," this plain purpose of God as
   shown by Amos and Isaiah. My judgment is [egO krinO]. Note expression
   of [egO]. I give my judgment. [Ego censeo]. James sums up the case as
   President of the Conference in a masterly fashion and with that
   consummate wisdom for which he is noted. It amounts to a resolution for
   the adoption by the assembly as happened (verse 33). That we trouble
   not [me parenochlein]. Present active infinitive with [me] in an
   indirect command (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1046) of [parenochleO], a
   common late verb, occurring here alone in the N.T. This double compound
   [para, en] is from the old compound [enochleO] [en] and [ochlos],
   crowd, annoyance) seen in Lu 6:18; Heb 12:15, and means to cause
   trouble beside [para] one or in a matter. This is the general point of
   James which he explains further concerning "those who are turning from
   the Gentiles unto God," the very kind of people referred to in Amos.

   15:20 But that we write unto them [alla episteilai autois]. By way of
   contrast [alla]. First aorist active infinitive of [epistellO], old
   verb to send to one (message, letter, etc.). Our word [epistle]
   [epistole] as in verse 30) comes from this verb. In the N.T. only here,
   He 13:22, and possibly Ac 21:25. That they abstain from [tou
   apechesthai]. The genitive of the articular infinitive of purpose,
   present middle (direct) of [apechO], old verb, to hold oneself back
   from. The best old MSS. do not have [apo], but the ablative is clear
   enough in what follows. James agrees with Peter in his support of Paul
   and Barnabas in their contention for Gentile freedom from the Mosaic
   ceremonial law. The restrictions named by James affect the moral code
   that applies to all (idolatry, fornication, murder). Idolatry,
   fornication and murder were the outstanding sins of paganism then and
   now (Re 22:15). Harnack argues ably against the genuineness of the word
   [pniktou] (strangled) which is absent from D Irenaeus, Tertullian,
   Cyprian. It is a nice point, though the best MSS. have it in accord
   with Le 17:10-16. The problem is whether the words were added because
   "blood" was understood as not "murder," but a reference to the Mosaic
   regulation or whether it was omitted to remove the ceremonial aspect
   and make it all moral and ethical. The Western text omits the word also
   in verse 29. But with the word retained here and in verse 29 the
   solution of James is not a compromise, though there is a wise
   concession to Jewish feeling. Pollutions of idols [alisgematOn]. From
   [alisgeO] only in the LXX and this substantive nowhere else. The word
   refers to idolatrous practices (pollutions) and things sacrificed to
   idols [eidOluthOn] in verse 29, not to sacrificial meat sold in the
   market (1Co 10:27), a matter not referred to here. Cf. Le 17:1-9. All
   the four items in the position of James (accepting [pniktou] are
   mentioned in Le 17, 18.

   15:21 For Moses [MOuses gar]. A reason why these four necessary things
   (verse 28) are named. In every city are synagogues where rabbis
   proclaim [kerussontas] these matters. Hence the Gentile Christians
   would be giving constant offence to neglect them. The only point where
   modern Christian sentiment would object would be about "things
   strangled" and "blood" in the sense of any blood left in the animals,
   though most Christians probably agree with the feeling of James in
   objecting to blood in the food. If "blood" is taken to be "murder,"
   that difficulty vanishes. Moses will suffer no loss for these Gentile
   Christians are not adherents of Judaism.

   15:22 Then it seemed good [Tote edoxen]. First aorist active indicative
   of [dokeO]. A regular idiom at the beginning of decrees. This Eirenicon
   of James commended itself to the whole assembly. Apparently a vote was
   taken which was unanimous, the Judaizers probably not voting. The
   apostles and the elders [tois apostolois kai tois presbuterois],
   article with each, dative case) probably all vocally expressed their
   position. With the whole church [sun holei tei ekklesiai]. Probably by
   acclamation. It was a great victory. But James was a practical leader
   and he did not stop with speeches and a vote. To choose men out of
   their company [eklezamenous andras ex autOn]. Accusative case, though
   dative just before [tois apostolois], etc.), of first aorist middle
   participle of [eklegO], to select. This loose case agreement appears
   also in [grapsantes] in verse 23 and in MSS. in verse 25. It is a
   common thing in all Greek writers (Paul, for instance), especially in
   the papyri and in the Apocalypse of John. Judas called Barsabbas
   [Ioudan ton kaloumenon Barsabban]. Not otherwise known unless he is a
   brother of Joseph Barsabbas of 1:23, an early follower of Jesus. The
   other, Silas, is probably a shortened form of Silvanus [Silouanos], 1Pe
   5:12), the companion of Paul in his second mission tour (Ac 15:32, 41;
   16:25). Chief men [hegoumenous]. Leaders, leading men (participle from
   [hegeomai], to lead).

   15:23 And they wrote [grapsantes]. First aorist active participle of
   [graphO] and the nominative as if a principal verb [epempsan] had been
   used instead of [pempsai], the first aorist active infinitive
   (anacoluthon). This committee of four (Judas, Silas, Barnabas, Paul)
   carried the letter which embodied the decision of the Conference. This
   letter is the writing out of the judgment of James and apparently
   written by him as the President. The apostles and the elders, brethren
   [hoi apostoloi kai hoi presbuteroi, adelphoi]. So the oldest and best
   MSS. without [kai] (and) before "brethren." This punctuation is
   probably correct and not "elder brethren." The inquiry had been sent to
   the apostles and elders (verse 2) though the whole church joined in the
   welcome (verse 4) and in the decision ( verse 22). The apostles and
   elders send the epistle, but call themselves "brothers to brothers,"
   Fratres Fratibus Salutem. "The brothers" [tois adelphois] addressed
   (dative case) are of the Gentiles [ex ethnOn] and those in Antioch,
   Syria, and Cilicia, because they were immediately involved. But the
   decision of this Conference was meant for Gentile Christians everywhere
   (16:4). Greeting [Chairein]. The customary formula in the beginning of
   letters, the absolute infinitive (usually [chairein] with the
   nominative absolute also as in Jas 1:1; Ac 23:26 and innumerable papyri
   (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1902f.).

   15:24 Certain which went from us [tines ex hemOn], Aleph B omit
   [exelthontes]. A direct blow at the Judaizers, put in delicate language
   (we heard [ekousamen] as if only at Antioch (15:1), and not also in
   Jerusalem in open meeting (15:5). Have troubled you with words
   [etaraxan humas logois]. What a picture of turmoil in the church in
   Antioch, words, words, words. Aorist tense of the common verb
   [tarassO], to agitate, to make the heart palpitate (Joh 14:1, 27) and
   instrumental case of [logois]. Subverting your souls [anaskeuazontes
   tas psuchas humOn]. Present active participle of [anaskeuazO], old verb
   [ana] and [skeuos], baggage) to pack up baggage, to plunder, to ravage.
   Powerful picture of the havoc wrought by the Judaizers among the
   simple-minded Greek Christians in Antioch. To whom we gave no
   commandment [hois ou diesteilametha]. First aorist middle indicative of
   [diastellO], old verb to draw asunder, to distinguish, to set forth
   distinctly, to command. This is a flat disclaimer of the whole conduct
   of the Judaizers in Antioch and in Jerusalem, a complete repudiation of
   their effort to impose the Mosaic ceremonial law upon the Gentile
   Christians.

   15:25 It seemed good unto us [edoxen hemin]. See statement by Luke in
   verse 22, and now this definite decision is in the epistle itself. It
   is repeated in verse 28. Having come to one accord [genomenois
   homothumadon]. On this adverb, common in Acts, see on 1:14. But
   [genomenois] clearly means that the final unity was the result of the
   Conference (private and public talks). The Judaizers are here brushed
   to one side as the defeated disturbers that they really were who had
   lacked the courage to vote against the majority. To choose out men and
   send them [eklexamenois andras pempsai] A B L, though Aleph C D read
   [eklexamenous] as in verse 22). Precisely the same idiom as in verse
   22, "having chosen out to send." With our beloved Barnabas and Paul
   [sun tois agapetois hemOn Barnabai kai PaulOi]. The verbal adjective
   [agapetois] (common in the N.T.) definitely sets the seal of warm
   approval on Barnabas and Paul. Paul (Ga 2:9) confirms this by his
   statement concerning the right hand of fellowship given.

   15:26 Have hazarded their lives [paradedOkosi tas psuchas autOn].
   Perfect active participle dative plural of [paradidOmi], old word, to
   hand over to another, and with [psuchas], to hand over to another their
   lives. The sufferings of Paul and Barnabas in Pisidia and Lycaonia were
   plainly well-known just as the story of Judson in Burmah is today. On
   the use of "name" here see on 3:6.

   15:27 Who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of
   mouth [kai autous dia logou apaggellontas ta auta]. Literally, "they
   themselves also by speech announcing the same things." The present
   participle, as here, sometimes is used like the future to express
   purpose as in 3:26 [eulogounta] after [apesteilen] and so here
   [apaggellontas] after [apestalkamen] (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1128).
   Judas and Silas are specifically endorsed (perfect active indicative of
   [apostellO] as bearers of the epistle who will also verbally confirm
   the contents of the letter.

   15:28 To the Holy Spirit and to us [tOi pneumati tOi hagiOi kai hemin].
   Dative case after [edoxen] (third example, verses 22, 25, 28). Definite
   claim that the church in this action had the guidance of the Holy
   Spirit. That fact was plain to the church from what had taken place in
   Caesarea and in this campaign of Paul and Barnabas (verse 8). Jesus had
   promised that the Holy Spirit would guide them into all truth (Joh
   16:13). Even so the church deliberated carefully before deciding. What
   a blessing it would be if this were always true! But even so the
   Judaizers are only silenced for the present, not convinced and only
   waiting for a better day to start over again. No greater burden [meden
   pleon baros]. The restrictions named did constitute some burden (cf. Mt
   20:12), for the old word [baros] means weight or heaviness. Morality
   itself is a restraint upon one's impulses as is all law a prohibition
   against license.

   15:29 Than these necessary things [plen toutOn tOn epanagkes]. This old
   adverb (from [epi] and [anagke] means on compulsion, of necessity. Here
   only in the N.T. For discussion of these items see on verses 20, 21. In
   comparison with the freedom won this "burden" is light and not to be
   regarded as a compromise in spite of the arguments of Lightfoot and
   Ramsay. It was such a concession as any converted Gentile would be glad
   to make even if "things strangled" be included. This "necessity" was
   not a matter of salvation but only for fellowship between Jews and
   Gentiles. The Judaizers made the law of Moses essential to salvation
   (15:16). It shall be well with you [eu praxete]. Ye shall fare well. A
   classical idiom used here effectively. The peace and concord in the
   fellowship of Jews and Gentiles will justify any slight concession on
   the part of the Gentiles. This letter is not laid down as a law, but it
   is the judgment of the Jerusalem Christians for the guidance of the
   Gentiles (16:4) and it had a fine effect at once (15:30-35). Trouble
   did come later from the Judaizers who were really hostile to the
   agreement in Jerusalem, but that opposition in no way discredits the
   worth of the work of this Conference. No sane agreement will silence
   perpetual and professional disturbers like these Judaizers who will
   seek to unsettle Paul's work in Antioch, in Corinth, in Galatia, in
   Jerusalem, in Rome. Fare ye well [ErrOsthe]. Valete. Perfect passive
   imperative of [rhOnnumi], to make strong. Common at the close of
   letters. Be made strong, keep well, fare well. Here alone in the N.T.
   though some MSS. have it in 23:30.

   15:30 So they [hoi men oun]. As in verse 3. When they were dismissed
   [apoluthentes]. First aorist passive participle of [apoluO], common
   verb to loosen, to dismiss. Possibly (Hackett) religious services were
   held as in verse 33 (cf. 13:3) and perhaps an escort for part of the
   way as in verse 3. The multitude [to plethos]. Public meeting of the
   church as in verses 1-3. Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 232) gives
   illustrations from the inscriptions of the use of [plethos] for
   official, political, and religious gatherings. The committee formally
   "delivered" [epedOkan] the epistle to the church authorities.

   15:31 When they had read it [anagnontes]. Second aorist active
   participle of [anaginOskO]. Public reading, of course, to the church.
   They rejoiced [echaresan]. Second aorist (ingressive) passive
   indicative of [chairO]. They burst into exultant joy showing clearly
   that they did not consider it a weak compromise, but a glorious victory
   of Gentile liberty. For the consolation [epi tei paraklesei]. The
   encouragement, the cheer in the letter. See [parekalesan] in verse 32.
   Consolation and exhortation run into one another in this word.

   15:32 Being themselves also prophets [kai autoi prophetai ontes]. As
   well as Paul and Barnabas and like Agabus (11:27-30), for-speakers for
   Christ who justify the commendation in the letter (verse 27) "with many
   words" [dia logou pollou], "with much talk," and no doubt with kindly
   words concerning the part played at the Conference by Paul and
   Barnabas. Confirmed [epesterixan]. See on 14:22. It was a glorious time
   with no Judaizers to disturb their fellowship as in 1-3.

   15:33 Some time [chronon]. Accusative after [poiesantes], "having done
   time." How long we do not know.

   15:34 But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there [edoxe de Silai
   epimeinai autou]. This verse is not in the Revised Version or in the
   text of Westcott and Hort, being absent from Aleph A B Vulgate, etc. It
   is clearly an addition to help explain the fact that Silas is back in
   Antioch in verse 40. But the "some days" of verse 36 afforded abundant
   time for him to return from Jerusalem. He and Judas went first to
   Jerusalem to make a report of their mission.

   15:35 Tarried [dietribon]. Imperfect active of [diatribO], old verb to
   pass time, seen already in 12:19; 14:3, 28. With many others also [meta
   kai heterOn pollOn]. A time of general revival and naturally so after
   the victory at Jerusalem. It is at this point that it is probable that
   the sad incident took place told by Paul in Ga 2:11-21. Peter came up
   to see how things were going in Antioch after Paul's victory in
   Jerusalem. At first Peter mingled freely with the Greek Christians
   without the compunctions shown at Caesarea and for which he had to
   answer in Jerusalem (Ac 11:1-18). Rumours of Peter's conduct reached
   Jerusalem and the Judaizers saw a chance to reopen the controversy on
   the line of social customs, a matter not passed on at the Jerusalem
   Conference. These Judaizers threaten Peter with a new trial and he
   surrenders and is followed by Barnabas and all the Jewish brethren in
   Antioch to the dismay of Paul who boldly rebuked Peter and Barnabas and
   won them back to his view. It was a crisis. Some would even date the
   Epistle to the Galatians at this time also, an unlikely hypothesis.

   15:36 Let us return now and visit the brethren [epistrepsantes de
   episkepsOmetha tous adelphous]. Paul takes the initiative as the
   leader, all the more so if the rebuke to Peter and Barnabas in Ga
   2:11-21 had already taken place. Paul is anxious, like a true
   missionary, to go back to the fields where he has planted the gospel.
   He uses the hortatory subjunctive [episkepsOmetha] for the proposal
   (see on 15:14 for this verb). Note the repeated [epi] [epi-strepsantes]
   and [episkepsOmetha]. There is special point in the use of [de]
   (shortened form of [ede], now at this juncture of affairs (cf. 13:2).
   How they fare [pOs echousin]. Indirect question, "how they have it."
   The precariousness of the life of new converts in pagan lands is shown
   in all of Paul's Epistles (Furneaux). So he wanted to go city by city
   [kata polin pasan].

   15:37 Was minded to take with them [ebouleto sunparalabein]. Imperfect
   middle [ebouleto], not aorist middle [ebouleusato] of the Textus
   Receptus. Barnabas willed, wished and stuck to it (imperfect tense).
   [Sunparalabein] is second aorist active infinitive of the double
   compound [sunparalambanO], old verb to take along together with, used
   already about John Mark in 12:25 and by Paul in Ga 2:1 about Titus.
   Nowhere else in the N.T. Barnabas used the ingressive aorist in his
   suggestion.

   15:38 But Paul thought not good to take with them [Paulos de exiou--me
   sunparalambanein touton]. The Greek is far more effective than this
   English rendering. It is the imperfect active of [axioO], old verb to
   think meet or right and the present active infinitive of the same verb
   [sunparalambanO] with negative used with this infinitive. Literally,
   "But Paul kept on deeming it wise not to be taking along with them this
   one." Barnabas looked on it as a simple punctiliar proposal (aorist
   infinitive), but Paul felt a lively realization of the problem of
   having a quitter on his hands (present infinitive). Each was insistent
   in his position (two imperfects). Paul had a definite reason for his
   view describing John Mark as "him who withdrew from them from
   Pamphylia" [ton apostanta ap' autOn apo Pamphulias]. Second aorist
   active articular participle of [aphistemi], intransitive use, "the one
   who stood off from, apostatized from" (our very word "apostasy"). And
   also as the one who "went not with them to the work" [kai me
   sunelthonta autois eis to ergon]. At Perga Mark had faced the same task
   that Paul and Barnabas did, but he flinched and flickered and quit.
   Paul declined to repeat the experiment with Mark.

   15:39 A sharp contention [paroxusmos]. Our very word paroxysm in
   English. Old word though only twice in the N.T. (here and Heb 10:24),
   from [paroxunO], to sharpen [para, oxus] as of a blade and of the
   spirit (Ac 17:16; 1Co 13:5). This "son of consolation" loses his temper
   in a dispute over his cousin and Paul uses sharp words towards his
   benefactor and friend. It is often so that the little irritations of
   life give occasion to violent explosions. If the incident in Ga 2:11-21
   had already taken place, there was a sore place already that could be
   easily rubbed. And if Mark also joined with Peter and Barnabas on that
   occasion, Paul had fresh ground for irritation about him. But there is
   no way to settle differences about men and we can only agree to
   disagree as Paul and Barnabas did. So that they parted asunder from one
   another [hOste apochOristhenai autous ap' allelOn]. Actual result here
   stated by [hOste] and the first aorist passive infinitive of
   [apochOrizO], old verb to sever, to separate, here only and Re 6:4 in
   the N.T. The accusative of general reference [autous] is normal. For
   construction with [hOste] see Robertson, Grammar, pp. 999f. And
   Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus [ton te Barnaban
   paralabonta ton Markon ekpleusai eis Kupron]. Second infinitival clause
   [ekpleusai] after [hOste] connected by [te]. The same participle is
   used here minus [sun, paralabonta] (second aorist active). Barnabas and
   Mark sailed out [ekpleusai] from [ekpleO] from the harbour of Antioch.
   This is the last glimpse that Luke gives us of Barnabas, one of the
   noblest figures in the New Testament. Paul has a kindly reference to
   him in 1Co 9:6. No one can rightly blame Barnabas for giving his cousin
   John Mark a second chance nor Paul for fearing to risk him again. One's
   judgment may go with Paul, but one's heart goes with Barnabas. And Mark
   made good with Barnabas, with Peter (1Pe 5:13) and finally with Paul
   (Col 4:10; 2Ti 4:11). See my little book on John Mark (Making Good in
   the Ministry). Paul and Barnabas parted in anger and both in sorrow.
   Paul owed more to Barnabas than to any other man. Barnabas was leaving
   the greatest spirit of the time and of all times.

   15:40 Chose [epilexamenos]. First aorist middle (indirect) participle
   of [epilegO], choosing for himself, as the successor of Barnabas, not
   of Mark who had no place in Paul's plans at this time. Commended
   [paradotheis]. First aorist passive of [paradidOmi], the same verb
   employed about Paul and Barnabas (14:26) on their return from the first
   tour. It is clear now that the sympathy of the church at Antioch is
   with Paul rather than with Barnabas in the cleavage that has come. The
   church probably recalled how in the pinch Barnabas flickered and went
   to the side of Peter and that it was Paul who for the moment stood
   Paulus contra mundum for Gentile liberty in Christ against the threat
   of the Judaizers from Jerusalem. Silas had influence in the church in
   Jerusalem (verse 22) and was apparently a Roman citizen (16:37) also.
   He is the Silas or Silvanus of the epistles (1Th 1:1; 2Th 1:1; 2Co
   1:19; 1Pe 5:12). It is remarkable that Peter mentions both Mark and
   Silas as with him (1Pe 5:12f.) at the same time.

   15:41 Went through [diercheto]. Imperfect middle. So Paul went forth on
   his second mission tour with heart-aches and high hopes mingled
   together. Syria and Cilicia [ten Surian kai ten Kilikian]. He took the
   opposite course from the first tour, leaving Cyprus to Barnabas and
   Mark. Probably Paul had established these churches while in Tarsus
   after leaving Jerusalem (Ac 9:30; Ga 1:21). Paul would go "by the Gulf
   of Issus through the Syrian Gates, a narrow road between steep rocks
   and the sea, and then inland, probably past Tarsus and over Mt. Taurus
   by the Cilician gates" (Page). This second tour will occupy Luke's
   story in Acts through 18:22.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 16

   16:1 And he came also to Derbe and Lystra [katentesen de kai eis Derben
   kai eis Lustran]. First aorist active of [katantaO], late verb to come
   down to, to arrive at. He struck Derbe first of the places in the first
   tour which was the last city reached then. Timothy [Timotheos].
   Apparently a native of Lystra ("there," [ekei], his Hebrew mother named
   Eunice and grandmother Lois (2Ti 1:5) and his Greek father's name not
   known. He may have been a proselyte, but not necessarily so as Timothy
   was taught the Scriptures by his mother and grandmother (2Ti 3:15),
   and, if a proselyte, he would have had Timothy circumcised. It is idle
   to ask if Paul came on purpose to get Timothy to take Mark's place.
   Probably Timothy was about eighteen years of age, a convert of Paul's
   former visit a few years before (1Ti 1:2) and still young twelve years
   later (1Ti 4:12). Paul loved him devotedly (1Ti 1:3; 5:23; 2Ti 3:15;
   Php 2:19f.). It is a glorious discovery to find a real young preacher
   for Christ's work.

   16:2 Was well reported of [emartureito]. Imperfect passive. It was a
   continuous witness that was borne the young disciple both in his home
   town of Lystra and in Derbe. Already he had so borne himself that his
   gifts and graces for the ministry were recognized. It is a wise
   precaution that the approval of the local church is necessary for the
   licensing and the ordaining of a preacher. If God has called a man for
   the work signs of it will be manifest to others.

   16:3 Him would Paul have to go forth with him [touton ethelesen ho
   Paulos sun autOi exelthein]. This one (note emphatic position) Paul
   wanted (first aorist active indicative of [thelO] with temporal augment
   as if from [ethelO] the old form). Here was a gifted young man who was
   both Jew and Greek. He took and circumcised him [labOn perietemen
   auton]. Any one could perform this rite. Paul had stoutly resisted
   circumcision in the case of Titus, a pure Greek (Ga 2:3, 5), because
   the whole principle of Gentile liberty was at stake. But Timothy was
   both Jew and Greek and would continually give offence to the Jews with
   no advantage to the cause of Gentile freedom. So here for the sake of
   expediency, "because of the Jews" [dia tous Ioudaious], Paul
   voluntarily removed this stumbling-block to the ministry of Timothy.
   Otherwise Timothy could not have been allowed to preach ln the
   synagogues. Idem non est semper idem. But Timothy's case was not the
   case of Titus. Here it was a question of efficient service, not an
   essential of salvation. Hovey notes that Timothy was circumcised
   because of Jewish unbelievers, not because of Jewish believers. Was a
   Greek [Hellen huperchen]. Imperfect active in indirect assertion where
   ordinarily the present [huparchei] would be retained, possibly
   indicating that his father was no longer living.

   16:4 They delivered them [paredidosan autois]. Imperfect active, kept
   on delivering to them in city after city. This is a proof of Paul's
   loyalty to the Jerusalem compact (Knowling). The circumcision of
   Timothy would indicate also that the points involved were under
   discussion and that Paul felt no inconsistency in what he did. The
   decrees [ta dogmata]. Old word from [dokeO], to give an opinion. It is
   used of public decrees of rulers (Lu 2:1; Ac 17:7), of the requirements
   of the Mosaic law (Col 2:14), and here of the regulations or
   conclusions of the Jerusalem Conference. Silas was with Paul and his
   presence gave added dignity to the passing out of the decrees, a
   charter of Gentile freedom, since he was one of the committee from
   Jerusalem to Antioch (15:22, 27, 32). Which had been ordained [ta
   kekrimena]. Perfect passive articular participle of [krinO], to judge,
   emphasizing the permanence of the conclusions reached by the apostles
   and elders in Jerusalem. For to keep [phulassein]. This present active
   infinitive likewise accents that it is a charter of liberty for
   continual living, not a temporary compromise.

   16:5 Were strengthened [estereounto]. Imperfect passive of [stereoO],
   old verb to make firm and solid like the muscles (Ac 3:7,16), these
   three the only examples in the N.T. Increased [eperisseuon]. Imperfect
   active of the old and common verb [perisseuO] from [perissos]
   (overplus). The blessing of God was on the work of Paul, Silas, and
   Timothy in the form of a continuous revival.

   16:6 The region of Phrygia and Galatia [ten Phrugian kai Galatiken
   chOran]. This is probably the correct text with one article and
   apparently describes one "Region" or District in The Province of
   Galatia which was also Phrygian (the old-ethnographic name with which
   compare the use of Lycaonia in 14:6). Strictly speaking Derbe and
   Lystra, though in the Province of Galatia, were not Phrygian, and so
   Luke would here be not resumptive of the record in verses 1-5; but a
   reference to the country around Iconium and Antioch in Pisidia in North
   Galatia is not included. This verse is hotly disputed at every point by
   the advocates of the North Galatian theory as represented by Chase and
   the South Galatian theory by Ramsay. Whatever is true in regard to the
   language of Luke here and in 18:23, it is still possible for Paul in Ga
   1:2 to use the term Galatia of the whole province of that name which
   could, in fact, apply to either South or North Galatia or to both. He
   could, of course, use it also in the ethnographic sense of the real
   Gauls or Celts who dwelt in North Galatia. Certainly the first tour of
   Paul and Barnabas was in the Province of Galatia though touching only
   the Regions of Pisidia, Phrygia, and Lycaonia, which province included
   besides the Gauls to the north. In this second tour Lycaonia has been
   already touched (Derbe and Lystra) and now Phrygia. The question arises
   why Luke here and in 18:23 adds the term "of Galatia" [Galatiken]
   though not in 13:14 (Pisidian Antioch) nor in 14:6 (cities of
   Lycaonia). Does Luke mean to use "of Galatia" in the same ethnographic
   sense as "of Phrygia" or does he here add the province (Galatia) to the
   name of the Region (Phrygia)? In itself either view is possible and it
   really matters very little except that the question is raised whether
   Paul went into the North Galatian Region on this occasion or later
   (18:23). He could have done so and the Epistle be addressed to the
   churches of South Galatia, North Galatia, or the province as a whole.
   But the Greek participle [kOluthentes] ("having been forbidden") plays
   a part in the argument that cannot be overlooked whether Luke means to
   say that Paul went north or not. This aorist passive participle of
   [kOluO], to hinder, can only express simultaneous or antecedent action,
   not subsequent action as Ramsay argues. No example of the so-called
   subsequent use of the aorist participle has ever been found in Greek as
   all Greek grammarians agree (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 860-63, 1112-14).
   The only natural meaning of [kOluthentes] is that Paul with Silas and
   Timothy "passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia" because they
   were hindered by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia (the
   Province of Asia of which Ephesus was the chief city and west of Derbe
   and Lystra). This construction implies that the country called "the
   region of Phrygia and Galatia" is not in the direct line west toward
   Ephesus. What follows in verse 7 throws further light on the point.

   16:7 Over against Mysia [kata ten Musian]. This was an ill-defined
   region rather north and west of Phrygia. The Romans finally absorbed
   most of it in the Province of Asia. They assayed to go into Bithynia
   [epeirazon eis ten Bithunian poreuthenai]. Conative imperfect of
   [peirazO] and ingressive aorist passive infinitive of [poreuomai]. Now
   Bithynia is northeast of Mysia and north of Galatia (province). Clearly
   Luke means to say that Paul had, when hindered by the Holy Spirit from
   going west into Asia, gone north so as to come in front of Bithynia.
   This journey would take him directly through Phrygia and the North
   Galatian country (the real Gauls or Celts). This is, to my mind, the
   strongest argument for the North Galatian view in these verses 6, 7.
   The grammar and the topography bring Paul right up to Bithynia (north
   of the old Galatia). It is verses 6, 7 that make me pause before
   accepting the plausible arguments of Ramsay for the South Galatian
   theory. In itself the problem is nothing like so important or so
   determinative as he makes it. But shall we smash Luke's grammar to
   pieces to bolster up a theory of criticism? And the Spirit of Jesus
   suffered them not [kai ouk eiasen autous to pneuma Iesou]. The same
   Spirit who in verse 6 had forbidden going into Asia now closed the door
   into Bithynia. This expression occurs nowhere else, but we have the
   spirit of Christ (Ro 8:9) and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Php 1:19).
   [Eiasen] is first aorist active indicative of [eaO], old verb to allow.

   16:8 Passing by Mysia [parelthontes ten Musian]. Literally, passing
   alongside or skirting Mysia, neglecting it without preaching there.
   Strictly they passed through part of it to reach Troas. To Troas [eis
   Troiada]. This city, named Alexandria Troas after Alexander the Great,
   was the seaport of Mysia, though a Roman colony and not counted as part
   of either Asia or Bithynia. New Ilium, on the site of the old Troy, was
   four miles farther north. It was the place to take ship for Philippi.
   Twice again Paul will be here (2Co 2:12; Ac 20:6).

   16:9 A vision [horama]. Old word, eleven times in Acts, once in Mt
   17:9. Twice Paul had been hindered by the Holy Spirit from going where
   he wanted to go. Most men would have gone back home with such rebuffs,
   but not so Paul. Now the call is positive and not negative, to go "far
   hence to the Gentiles" (22:21). He had little dreamed of such a call
   when he left Antioch. Paul's frequent visions always came at real
   crises in his life. A man of Macedonia [aner MakedOn]. Ramsay follows
   Renan in the view that this was Luke with whom Paul had conversed about
   conditions in Macedonia. verse 10 makes it plain that Luke was now in
   the party, but when he joined them we do not know. Some hold that Luke
   lived at Antioch in Syria and came on with Paul and Silas, others that
   he joined them later in Galatia, others that he appeared now either as
   Paul's physician or new convert. Ramsay thinks that Philippi was his
   home at this time. But, whatever is true about Luke, the narrative must
   not be robbed of its supernatural aspect (10:10; 22:17). Was standing
   [en hestOs]. Second perfect active participle of [histemi],
   intransitive, periphrastic imperfect. Vivid picture. Help us [boetheson
   hemin]. Ingressive first aorist active imperative of [boetheO] [boe,
   theO], to run at a cry, to help. The man uses the plural for all
   including himself. It was the cry of Europe for Christ.

   16:10 We sought [ezetesamen]. This sudden use of the plural, dropped in
   17:1 when Paul leaves Philippi, and resumed in 20:5 when Paul rejoins
   Luke in Philippi, argues conclusively that Luke, the author, is in the
   party ("we" portions of Acts) and shows in a writer of such literary
   skill as Luke that he is not copying a document in a blundering sort of
   way. Paul told his vision to the party and they were all ready to
   respond to the call. Concluding [sunbibazontes]. A very striking word,
   present active participle of [sunbibazO], old verb to make go together,
   to coalesce or knit together, to make this and that agree and so to
   conclude. Already in 9:22 of Paul's preaching. This word here gives a
   good illustration of the proper use of the reason in connection with
   revelation, to decide whether it is a revelation from God, to find out
   what it means for us, and to see that we obey the revelation when
   understood. God had called them to preach to the Macedonians. They had
   to go.

   16:11 Setting sail [anachthentes]. Same word in 13:13 which see. We
   made a straight course [euthudromesamen]. First aorist active
   indicative of compound verb [euthudromeO] (in Philo) from adjective
   [euthudromos] (in Strabo), running a straight course [euthus, dromos].
   In the N.T. only here and 21:1. It is a nautical term for sailing
   before the wind. Luke has a true feeling for the sea. To Samothrace
   [eis Samothraiken]. A small island in the Aegean about halfway between
   Troas and Neapolis. The day following [tei epiousei]. Locative case of
   time with [hemerai] (day) to be supplied (7:26; 20:15; 21:18; 23:11).
   With adverse winds it took five days to make the run of 125 miles
   (20:6). To Neapolis [eis Nean Polin]. To New Town (Newton, Naples,
   Neapolis). The port of Philippi ten miles distant, Thracian, but
   reckoned as Macedonian after Vespasian.

   16:12 To Philippi [eis Philippous]. The plural like [Athenai] (Athens)
   is probably due to separate sections of the city united (Winer-Moulton,
   Grammar, p. 220). The city (ancient name Krenides or Wells) was renamed
   after himself by Philip, the father of Alexander the Great. It was
   situated about a mile east of the small stream Gangites which flows
   into the river Strymon some thirty miles away. In this valley the
   Battle of Philippi was fought B.C. 42 between the Second Triumvirate
   (Octavius, Antonius, Lepidus) and Brutus and Cassius. In memory of the
   victory Octavius made it a colony [kolOnia] with all the privileges of
   Roman citizenship, such as freedom from scourging, freedom from arrest
   save in extreme cases, and the right of appeal to the emperor. This
   Latin word occurs here alone in the N.T. Octavius planted here a colony
   of Roman veterans with farms attached, a military outpost and a
   miniature of Rome itself. The language was Latin. Here Paul is face to
   face with the Roman power and empire in a new sense. He was a new
   Alexander, come from Asia to conquer Europe for Christ, a new Caesar to
   build the Kingdom of Christ on the work of Alexander and Caesar. One
   need not think that Paul was conscious of all that was involved in
   destiny for the world. Philippi was on the Egnatian Way, one of the
   great Roman roads, that ran from here to Dyrrachium on the shores of
   the Adriatic, a road that linked the east with the west. The first of
   the district [prOte tes meridos]. Philippi was not the first city of
   Macedonia nor does Luke say so. That honour belonged to Thessalonica
   and even Amphipolis was larger than Philippi. It is not clear whether
   by [meris] Luke means a formal division of the province, though the
   Koine has examples of this geographical sense (papyri). There is no
   article with [prOte] and Luke may not mean to stress unduly the
   position of Philippi in comparison with Amphipolis. But it was
   certainly a leading city of this district of Macedonia. We were
   tarrying [emen diatribontes]. Periphrastic imperfect active.

   16:13 By a river side [para potamon]. The little river Gangites (or
   Gargites) was one mile west of the town. Philippi as a military outpost
   had few Jews. There was evidently no synagogue inside the city, but
   "without the gates" [exO tes pules] they had noticed an enclosure
   "where we supposed" [hou enomizomen], correct text, imperfect active),
   probably as they came into the city, "was a place of prayer"
   [proscuchen einai]. Infinitive with accusative of general reference in
   indirect discourse. [Proseuche] is common in the LXX and the N.T. for
   the act of prayer as in Ac 2:42 then for a place of prayer either a
   synagogue (III Macc. 7:20) or more often an open air enclosure near the
   sea or a river where there was water for ceremonial ablutions. The word
   occurs also in heathen writers for a place of prayer (Schurer, Jewish
   People, Div. II, Vol. II, p. 69, Engl. Tr.). Deissmann (Bible Studies,
   p. 222) quotes an Egyptian inscription of the third century B.C. with
   this sense of the word and one from Panticapaeum on the Black Sea of
   the first century A.D. (Light from the Ancient East, p. 102). Juvenal
   (III. 296) has a sneering reference to the Jewish [proseucha]. Josephus
   (Ant. XIV. 10, 23) quotes a decree of Halicarnassus which allowed the
   Jews "to make their prayers [proseuchas] on the seashore according to
   the custom of their fathers." There was a synagogue in Thessalonica,
   but apparently none in Amphipolis and Apollonia (Ac 17:1). The rule of
   the rabbis required ten men to constitute a synagogue, but here were
   gathered only a group of women at the hour of prayer. In pioneer days
   in this country it was a common thing to preach under bush arbours in
   the open air. John Wesley and George Whitfield were great open air
   preachers. Paul did not have an inspiring beginning for his work in
   Europe, but he took hold where he could. The conjecture was correct. It
   was a place of prayer, but only a bunch of women had come together
   [tais sunelthousais gunaixin], excuse enough for not preaching to some
   preachers, but not to Paul and his party. The "man of Macedonia" turned
   out to be a group of women (Furneaux). Macedonian inscriptions show
   greater freedom for women in Macedonia than elsewhere at this time and
   confirm Luke's story of the activities of women in Philippi,
   Thessalonica, Berea. We sat down and spake [kathisantes elaloumen].
   Having taken our seats (aorist active participle of [kathizO] we began
   to speak or preach (inchoative imperfect of [laleO], often used for
   preaching). Sitting was the Jewish attitude for public speaking. It was
   not mere conversation, but more likely conversational preaching of an
   historical and expository character. Luke's use of the first person
   plural implies that each of the four (Paul, Silas, Timothy, Luke)
   preached in turn, with Paul as chief speaker.

   16:14 Lydia [Ludia]. Her birthplace was Thyatira in Lydia. She may have
   been named after the land, though Lydia is a common female name (see
   Horace). Lydia was itself a Macedonian colony (Strabo, XIII. 4).
   Thyatira (note plural form like Philippi and one of the seven churches
   of Asia here Re 2:18) was famous for its purple dyes as old as Homer
   (Iliad, IV. 141) and had a guild of dyers [hoi bapheis] as inscriptions
   show. A seller of purple [porphuropOlis]. A female seller of purple
   fabrics [porphura, pOlis]. Late word, masculine form in an inscription.
   There was a great demand for this fabric as it was used on the official
   toga at Rome and in Roman colonies. We still use the term "royal
   purple." See on Lu 16:19. Evidently Lydia was a woman of some means to
   carry on such an important enterprise from her native city. She may
   have been a freed-woman, since racial names were often borne by slaves.
   One that worshipped God [sebomene ton theon]. A God-fearer or proselyte
   of the gate. There was a Jewish settlement in Thyatira which was
   especially interested in the dyeing industry. She probably became a
   proselyte there. Whether this was true of the other women we do not
   know. They may have been Jewesses or proselytes like Lydia, probably
   all of them employees of hers in her business. When Paul writes to the
   Philippians he does not mention Lydia who may have died meanwhile and
   who certainly was not Paul's wife. She was wealthy and probably a
   widow. Heard us [ekouen]. Imperfect active of [akouO], was listening,
   really listening and she kept it up, listening to each of these new and
   strange preachers. Opened [dienoixen]. First aorist active indicative
   of [dianoigO], old word, double compound [dia, ana, oigO] to open up
   wide or completely like a folding door (both sides, [dia], two). Only
   the Lord could do that. Jesus had opened (the same verb) the mind of
   the disciples to understand the Scriptures (Lu 24:45). To give heed
   [prosechein]. To hold the mind [ton noun] understood), present active
   infinitive. She kept her mind centred on the things spoken by Paul
   whose words gripped her attention. She rightly perceived that Paul was
   the foremost one of the group. He had personal magnetism and power of
   intellect that the Spirit of God used to win the heart of this
   remarkable woman to Christ. It was worth coming to Philippi to win this
   fine personality to the Kingdom of God. She will be the chief spirit in
   this church that will give Paul more joy and co-operation than any of
   his churches. It is not stated that she was converted on the first
   Sabbath, though this may have been the case. "One solitary convert, a
   woman, and she already a seeker after God, and a native of that very
   Asia where they had been forbidden to preach" (Furneaux). But a new era
   had dawned for Europe and for women in the conversion of Lydia.

   16:15 And when she was baptized [hOs de ebaptisthe]. First aorist
   passive indicative of [baptizO]. The river Gangites was handy for the
   ordinance and she had now been converted and was ready to make this
   public declaration of her faith in Jesus Christ. And her household [kai
   ho oikos autes]. Who constituted her "household"? The term [oikos],
   originally means the building as below, "into my house" and then it
   includes the inmates of a house. There is nothing here to show whether
   Lydia's "household" went beyond "the women" employed by her who like
   her had heard the preaching of Paul and had believed. "Possibly Euodia
   and Syntyche and the other women, Php 4:2, 3, may have been included in
   the family of Lydia, who may have employed many slaves and freed women
   in her trade" (Knowling). "This statement cannot be claimed as any
   argument for infant baptism, since the Greek word may mean her servants
   or her work-people" (Furneaux). In the household baptisms (Cornelius,
   Lydia, the jailor, Crispus) one sees "infants" or not according to his
   predilections or preferences. If ye have judged me [ei kekrikate me].
   Condition of the first class, assumed to be true [ei] and the
   indicative, here perfect active of [krinO]. She had confessed her faith
   and submitted to baptism as proof that she was "faithful to the Lord"
   [pisten tOi kuriOi], believing on the Lord. "If she was fit for that,
   surely she was fit to be their hostess" (Furneaux). And Paul and his
   party had clearly no comfortable place to stay while in Philippi. The
   ancient hotels or inns were abominable. Evidently Paul demurred for
   there were four of them and he did not wish to sacrifice his
   independence or be a burden even to a woman of wealth. And she
   constrained us [kai parebiasato hemas]. Effective first aorist middle
   of [parabiazomai], late word, in the N.T. only here and Lu 24:29. Some
   moral force [bia] or hospitable persuasion was required (cf. 1Sa
   28:23), but Lydia had her way as women usually do. So he accepted
   Lydia's hospitality in Philippi, though he worked for his own living in
   Thessalonica (2Th 3:8) and elsewhere (2Co 11:9). So far only women have
   been won to Christ in Philippi. The use of "us" shows that Luke was not
   a householder in Philippi.

   16:16 A spirit of divination [pneuma puthOna]. So the correct text with
   accusative (apparition, a spirit, a python), not the genitive
   [puthOnos]. Hesychius defines it as [daimonion manikon] (a spirit of
   divination). The etymology of the word is unknown. Bengel suggests
   [puthesthai] from [punthanomai], to inquire. Python was the name given
   to the serpent that kept guard at Delphi, slain by Apollo, who was
   called [Puthios Apollo] and the prophetess at Delphi was termed Pythia.
   Certainly Luke does not mean to credit Apollo with a real existence
   (1Co 8:4). But Plutarch (A.D. 50-100) says that the term [puthOnes] was
   applied to ventriloquists [eggastrimuthoi]. In the LXX those with
   familiar spirits are called by this word ventriloquists (Le 19:31;
   20:6, 27, including the witch of Endor 1Sa 28:7). It is possible that
   this slave girl had this gift of prophecy "by soothsaying"
   [manteuomene]. Present middle participle of [manteuomai], old heathen
   word (in contrast with [propheteuO] for acting the seer [mantis] and
   this kin to [mainomai], to be mad, like the howling dervishes of later
   times. This is the so-called instrumental use of the circumstantial
   participles. Brought [pareichen]. Imperfect active of [parechO], a
   steady source of income. Much gain [ergasian pollen]. Work, business,
   from [ergazomai], to work. Her masters [tois kuriois autes]. Dative
   case. Joint owners of this poor slave girl who were exploiting her
   calamity, whatever it was, for selfish gain, just as men and women
   today exploit girls and women in the "white slave" trade. As a
   fortune-teller she was a valuable asset for all the credulous dupes of
   the community. Simon Magus in Samaria and Elymas Barjesus in Cyprus had
   won power and wealth as soothsayers.

   16:17 The Most High God [tou theou tou hupsistou]. Pagan inscriptions
   use this language for the Supreme Being. It looks like supernatural
   testimony like that borne by the demoniacs to Jesus as "son of the Most
   High God" (Lu 8:28. Cf; also Mr 1:24; 3:11; Mt 8:29; Lu 4:41, etc.).
   She may have heard Paul preach about Jesus as the way of salvation. The
   way of salvation [hodon sOterias]. A way of salvation, strictly
   speaking (no article). There were many "ways of salvation" offered to
   men then as now.

   16:18 She did [epoiei]. Imperfect active, kept it up for many days. The
   strange conduct gave Paul and the rest an unpleasant prominence in the
   community. Being sore troubled [diaponetheis]. First aorist passive of
   [diaponeO], old verb, to work laboriously, then in passive to be
   "worked up," displeased, worn out. In the N.T. only here and 4:2 which
   see (there of the Sadducees about Peter's preaching). Paul was grieved,
   annoyed, indignant. He wanted no testimony from a source like this any
   more than he did the homage of the people of Lystra (14:14). That very
   hour [autei tei hOrai]. Locative case of time and familiar Lukan idiom
   in his Gospel, "at the hour itself." The cure was instantaneous. Paul,
   like Jesus, distinguished between the demon and the individual.

   16:19 Was gone [exelthen]. Was gone out of the slave girl, second
   aorist active indicative of [exerchomai]. "The two most important
   social revolutions worked by Christianity have been the elevation of
   woman and the abolition of slavery" (Furneaux). Both are illustrated
   here (Lydia and this slave girl). "The most sensitive part of
   civilized' man is the pocket" (Ramsay). Laid hold on [epilabomenoi].
   Second aorist middle participle of [epilambanO] as in 9:27; 17:19, but
   here with hostile intent. Dragged [heilkusan]. First aorist active
   indicative of [helkuO], late form of the old verb [helkO] (also in Jas
   2:6) to draw as a sword, and then to drag one forcibly as here and
   21:30. It is also used of spiritual drawing as by Jesus in Joh 12:32.
   Here it is by violence. Into the marketplace [eis ten agoran]. Into the
   Roman forum near which would be the courts of law as in our courthouse
   square, as in 17:17. Marketing went on also (Mr 7:4), when the crowds
   collect (Mr 6:56), from [ageirO], to collect or gather. Unto the rulers
   [epi tous archontas]. General Greek term for "the magistrates."

   16:20 Unto the magistrates [tois strategois]. Greek term [stratos, agO]
   for leader of an army or general. But in civic life a governor. The
   technical name for the magistrates in a Roman colony was duumviri or
   duumvirs, answering to consuls in Rome. [Strategoi] here is the Greek
   rendering of the Latin praetores (praetors), a term which they
   preferred out of pride to the term duumviri. Since they represented
   consuls, the praetors or duumvirs were accompanied by lictors bearing
   rods (verse 35). These men [houtoi hoi anthrOpoi]. Contemptuous use.
   Being Jews [Ioudaioi huparchontes]. The people of Philippi, unlike
   those in Antioch (11:26), did not recognize any distinction between
   Jews and Christians. These four men were Jews. This appeal to race
   prejudice would be especially pertinent then because of the recent
   decree of Claudius expelling Jews from Rome (18:2). It was about A.D.
   49 or 50 that Paul is in Philippi. The hatred of the Jews by the Romans
   is known otherwise (Cicero, Pro Flacco, XXVIII; Juvenal, XIV. 96-106).
   Do exceedingly trouble [ektarassousin]. Late compound (effective use of
   [ek] in composition) and only here in the N.T.

   16:21 Customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe,
   being Romans [ethe ha ouk estin hemin paradechesthai oude poiein
   ROmaiois ousin]. Note the sharp contrast between "being Jews" in verse
   20 and "being Romans" here. This pose of patriotism is all sound and
   fury. It is love of money that moves these "masters" far more than zeal
   for Rome. As Roman citizens in a colony they make full use of all their
   rights of protest. Judaism was a religio licita in the Roman empire,
   only they were not allowed to make proselytes of the Romans themselves.
   No Roman magistrate would pass on abstract theological questions
   (18:15), but only if a breach of the peace was made [ektarassousin
   hemOn ten polin] or the formation of secret sects and organizations.
   Evidently both of these last points are involved by the charges of
   "unlawful customs" by the masters who are silent about their real
   ground of grievance against Paul and Silas. [Ethos] (kin to [ethos],
   1Co 15:33) is from [ethO], to be accustomed or used to a thing. The
   Romans granted toleration to conquered nations to follow their
   religious customs provided they did not try to win the Romans. But the
   Jews had made great headway to favour (the God-fearers) with increasing
   hatred also. Emperor worship had in store grave peril for both Jews and
   Christians. The Romans will care more for this than for the old gods
   and goddesses. It will combine patriotism and piety.

   16:22 Rose up together [sunepeste]. Second aorist (ingressive) active
   of the double compound [sunephistemi], intransitive, old verb, but only
   here in the N.T. (cf. [katepestesan] in 18:12). There was no actual
   attack of the mob as Paul and Silas were in the hands of the officers,
   but a sudden and violent uprising of the people, the appeal to race and
   national prejudice having raised a ferment. Rent their garments off
   them [perirexantes autOn ta himatia]. First aorist active participle of
   [periregnumi], old verb, to break off all around, to strip or rend all
   round. Here only in the N.T. The duumvirs probably gave orders for Paul
   and Silas to be stripped of their outer garments [himatia], though not
   actually doing it with their own hands, least of all not stripping off
   their own garments in horror as Ramsay thinks. That would call for the
   middle voice. In II Macc. 4:38 the active voice is used as here of
   stripping off the garments of others. Paul in 1Th 2:2 refers to the
   shameful treatment received in Philippi, "insulted" [hubristhentas]. As
   a Roman citizen this was unlawful, but the duumvirs looked on Paul and
   Silas as vagabond and seditious Jews and "acted with the highhandedness
   characteristic of the fussy provincial authorities" (Knowling).
   Commanded [ekeleuon]. Imperfect active, repeatedly ordered. The usual
   formula of command was: "Go, lictors; strip off their garments; let
   them be scourged." To beat them with rods [rhabdizein]. Present active
   infinitive of [rhabdizO], old verb, but in the N.T. = virgis caedere
   only here and 2Co 11:25 where Paul alludes to this incident and two
   others not given by Luke [tris erhabdisthen]. He came near getting
   another in Jerusalem (Ac 22:25). Why did not Paul say here that he was
   a Roman citizen as he does later (verse 37) and in Jerusalem (22:26f.)?
   It might have done no good in this hubbub and no opportunity was
   allowed for defence of any kind.

   16:23 When they had laid [epithentes]. Second aorist (constative)
   active participle of [epitithemi], to place upon. Many stripes [pollas
   plegas]. The Jewish law was forty stripes save one (2Co 11:24). The
   Roman custom depended on the caprice of the judge and was a terrible
   ordeal. It was the custom to inflict the stripes on the naked body
   (back) as Livy 2.5 says: "Missique lictores ad sumendum supplicium,
   nudatos virgis caedunt." On [plegas] (from [plessO], to strike a blow)
   see on Lu 10:30; 12:47f. The jailor [tOi desmophulaki]. Late word
   [desmos, phulax], keeper of bonds), in the N.T. only here (verses 23,
   27, 36). The LXX has the word [archidesmophulax] (Ge 39:21-23).
   Chrysostom calls this jailor Stephanus, he was of Achaia (1Co 16:15).
   To keep safely [asphalOs terein]. Present active infinitive, to keep on
   keeping safely, perhaps "as dangerous political prisoners" (Rackham).
   He had some rank and was not a mere turnkey.

   16:24 Into the inner prison [eis ten esOteran phulaken]. The
   comparative form from the adverb [esO] (within), Ionic and old Attic
   for [eisO]. In the LXX, but in the N.T. only here and Heb 6:19. The
   Roman public prisons had a vestibule and outer prison and behind this
   the inner prison, a veritable dungeon with no light or air save what
   came through the door when open. One has only to picture modern cells
   in our jails, the dungeons in feudal castles, London prisons before the
   time of Howard, to appreciate the horrors of an inner prison cell in a
   Roman provincial town of the first century A.D. Made their feet fast
   [tous podas esphalisato autOn]. First aorist (effective) middle of
   [asphalizO], from [asphales] (safe), common verb in late Greek, in the
   N.T. only here and Mt 24:64ff. The inner prison was safe enough without
   this refinement of cruelty. In the stocks [eis to xulon]. [Xulon], from
   [xuO], to scrape or plane, is used for a piece of wood whether a cross
   or gibbet (Ac 5:30; 10:39; 13:29; Ga 3:13; 1Pe 2:24) or a log or timber
   with five holes (four for the wrists and ankles and one for the neck)
   or two for the feet as here, [xulopede], Latin vervus, to shackle the
   feet stretched apart (Job 33:11). This torment was practiced in Sparta,
   Athens, Rome, and Adonirom Judson suffered it in Burmah. [Xulon] is
   also used in the N.T. for stick or staff (Mt 26:47) and even a tree (Lu
   23:31). Tertullian said of Christians in the stocks: Nihil crus sentit
   in vervo, quum animus in caelo est (Nothing the limb feels in the
   stocks when the mind is in heaven).

   16:25 About midnight [kata de mesonuktion]. Middle of the night, old
   adjective seen already in Mr 13:35; Lu 11:5 which see. Were praying and
   singing [proseuchomenoi humnoun]. Present middle participle and
   imperfect active indicative: Praying they were singing (simultaneously,
   blending together petition and praise). [HumneO] is an old verb from
   [humnos] (cf. Isa 12:4; Da 3:23). Paul and Silas probably used portions
   of the Psalms (cf. Lu 1:39f., 67f.; 2:28f.) with occasional original
   outbursts of praise. Were listening to them [epekroOnto autOn].
   Imperfect middle of [epakroaomai]. Rare verb to listen with pleasure as
   to a recitation or music (Page). It was a new experience for the
   prisoners and wondrously attractive entertainment to them.

   16:26 Earthquake [seismos]. Old word from [seiO], to shake. Luke
   regarded it as an answer to prayer as in 4:31. He and Timothy were not
   in prison. So that the foundations of the prison house were shaken
   [hOste saleuthenai ta themelia tou desmOteriou]. Regular construction
   of the first aorist passive infinitive and the accusative of general
   reference with [hOste] for actual result just like the indicative. This
   old word for prison house already in Mt 11:2; Ac 5:21, 23 which see.
   [Themelia] is neuter plural of the adjective [themelios], from [thema]
   (thing laid down from [tithemi]. So already in Lu 6:48; 14:29. If the
   prison was excavated from rocks in the hillside, as was often the case,
   the earthquake would easily have slipped the bars of the doors loose
   and the chains would have fallen out of the walls. Were opened
   [eneOichthesan]. First aorist passive indicative of [anoigO] (or
   [-numi] with triple augment [e, e, O], while there is no augment in
   [anethe] (first aorist passive indicative of [aniemi], were loosed),
   old verb, but in the N.T. only here and 27:40; Eph 6:9; Heb 13:5.

   16:27 Being roused out of sleep [exupnos genomenos]. Becoming [exupnos]
   (rare word, only here in N.T., in LXX and Josephus). An earthquake like
   that would wake up any one. Open [aneOigmenos]. Perfect passive
   participle with double reduplication in predicate position, standing
   open. Drew his sword [spasamenos ten machairan]. First aorist middle
   participle of [spaO], to draw, as in Mr 14:47, drawing his own sword
   himself. Our word spasm from this old word. Was about [emellen].
   Imperfect active of [mellO] with both syllabic and temporal augment and
   followed here by present infinitive. He was on the point of committing
   suicide as Brutus had done near here. Stoicism had made suicide popular
   as the escape from trouble like the Japanese harikari. Had escaped
   [ekpepheugenai]. Second perfect active infinitive of [ekpheugO], old
   verb with perfective force of [ek], to flee out, to get clean away.
   This infinitive and accusative of general reference is due to indirect
   discourse after [nomizOn]. Probably the prisoners were so panic
   stricken by the earthquake that they did not rally to the possibility
   of escape before the jailor awoke. He was responsible for the prisoners
   with his life (12:19; 27:42).

   16:28 Do thyself no harm [meden praxeis seautOi kakon]. The usual
   construction [me] and the aorist subjunctive) for a prohibition not to
   begin to do a thing. The older Greek would probably have used
   [poieseis] here. The later Greek does not always preserve the old
   distinction between [poieO], to do a thing, and [prassO], to practice,
   though [prassete] keeps it in Php 4:9 and [poieO] is rightly used in Lu
   3:10-14. As a matter of fact [prassO] does not occur in Matthew or in
   Mark, only twice in John, six times in Luke's Gospel, thirteen in Acts,
   and elsewhere by Paul. Sprang in [eisepedesen]. First aorist active of
   [eispedaO], old verb, but here only in the N.T. Cf. [ekpedaO] in 14:14.
   The jailor was at the outer door and he wanted lights to see what was
   inside in the inner prison.

   16:29 Trembling for fear [entromos genomenos]. "Becoming terrified."
   The adjective [entromos] (in terror) occurs in N.T. only here and 7:32;
   Heb 12:21. Fell down [prosepesen]. Second aorist active indicative of
   [prospiptO], old verb. An act of worship as Cornelius before Peter
   (10:25), when [prosekunesen] is used.

   16:30 Brought them out [progagOn autous exO]. Second aorist active
   participle of [proagO], to lead forward. He left the other prisoners
   inside, feeling that he had to deal with these men whom he had
   evidently heard preach or had heard of their message as servants of the
   Most High God as the slave girl called them. There may have been
   superstition behind his fear, but there was evident sincerity.

   16:31 To be saved [hina sOthO]. Final clause with [hina] and first
   aorist passive subjunctive. What did he mean by "saved"? Certainly more
   than escape from peril about the prisoners or because of the
   earthquake, though these had their influences on him. Cf. way of
   salvation in verse 17. Believe on the Lord Jesus [Pisteuson epi ton
   kurion Iesoun]. This is what Peter told Cornelius (10:43). This is the
   heart of the matter for both the jailor and his house.

   16:32 They spake the word of God [elalesan ton logon tou theou]. So
   Paul and Silas gave fuller exposition of the way of life to the jailor
   "with all that were in his house." It was a remarkable service with
   keenest attention and interest, the jailor with his warden, slaves, and
   family.

   16:33 Washed their stripes [elousen apo tOn plegOn]. Deissmann (Bible
   Studies, p. 227) cites an inscription of Pergamum with this very
   construction of [apo] and the ablative, to wash off, though it is an
   old verb. This first aorist active indicative of [louO], to bathe,
   succinctly shows what the jailor did to remove the stains left by the
   rods of the lictors ( verse 22). [NiptO] was used for washing parts of
   the body. And was baptized, he and all his, immediately [kai ebaptisthe
   autos kai hoi autou hapantes parachrema]. The verb is in the singular
   agreeing with [autos], but it is to be supplied with [hoi autou], and
   it was done at once.

   16:34 He brought them up [anagagOn]. Second aorist active participle of
   [anagO]. It looks as if his house was above the prison. The baptism
   apparently took place in the pool or tank in which he bathed Paul and
   Silas (De Wette) or the rectangular basin (impluvium) in the court for
   receiving the rain or even in a swimming pool or bath [kolumbethra]
   found within the walls of the prison (Kuinoel). Meyer: "Perhaps the
   water was in the court of the house; and the baptism was that of
   immersion, which formed an essential part of the symbolism of the act."
   Set meat [paretheken trapezan]. Set a "table" before them with food on
   it. They had probably had no food for a day. With all his house
   [panoikei]. Adverb, once in Plato, though usually [panoikiai]. In LXX,
   but here alone in the N.T. It is in an amphibolous position and can be
   taken either with "rejoiced" [egalliasato] or "having believed"
   [pepisteukOs], perfect active participle, permanent belief), coming
   between them. The whole household (family, warden, slaves) heard the
   word of God, believed in the Lord Jesus, made confession, were
   baptized, and rejoiced. Furneaux considers the haste in baptism here
   "precipitate" as in the baptism of the eunuch. But why delay?

   16:35 The serjeants [tous rhabdouchous]. Fasces-bearers, regular Greek
   word [rhabdos, echO] for Latin lictores though Cicero says that they
   should carry baculi, not fasces. Was this message because of the
   earthquake, the influence of Lydia, or a belated sense of justice on
   the part of the magistrates (praetors)? Perhaps a bit of all three may
   be true. The Codex Bezae expressly says that the magistrates "assembled
   together in the market place and recollecting the earthquake that had
   happened they were afraid."

   16:36 Now therefore [nun oun]. Note both particles (time and
   inference). It was a simple matter to the jailor and he was full of
   glee over this happy outcome.

   16:37 Unto them [pros autous]. The lictors by the jailor. The reply of
   Paul is a marvel of brevity and energy, almost every word has a
   separate indictment showing the utter illegality of the whole
   proceeding. They have beaten us [deirantes hemas]. First aorist active
   participle of [derO], old verb to flay, to skin, to smite. The Lex
   Valeria B.C. 509 and the Lex Poscia B.C. 248 made it a crime to inflict
   blows on a Roman citizen. Cicero says, "To fetter a Roman citizen was a
   crime, to scourge him a scandal, to slay him--parricide." Claudius had
   "deprived the city of Rhodes of its freedom for having crucified some
   citizen of Rome" (Rackham). Publicly [demosiai]. This added insult to
   injury. Common adverb [hodOi] supplied with adjective, associative
   instrumental case, opposed to [idiai] or [kat' oikous], Ac 20:20)
   Uncondemned [akatakritous]. This same verbal adjective from
   [kata-krinO] with [a] privative is used by Paul in 22:25 and nowhere
   else in the N.T. Rare in late Greek like [akatagnOstos], but in late
   Koine (papyri, inscriptions). The meaning is clearly "without being
   tried." Paul and Silas were not given a chance to make a defence. They
   were sentenced unheard (25:16). Even slaves in Roman law had a right to
   be heard. Men that are Romans [anthrOpous Romaious huparchontas]. The
   praetors did not know, of course, that Paul and Silas were Roman
   citizens any more than Lysias knew it in Ac 22:27. Paul's claim is not
   challenged in either instance. It was a capital offence to make a false
   claim to Roman citizenship. Have cast us into prison [ebalan eis
   phulaken]. Second aorist active indicative of [ballO], old verb, with
   first aorist ending as often in the Koine [-an], not [-on]. This was
   the climax, treating them as criminals. And now privily [kai nun
   lathrai]. Paul balances their recent conduct with the former. Nay
   verily, but [ou gar, alla]. No indeed! It is the use of [gar] so common
   in answers [ge+ara] as in Mt 27:23. [Alla] gives the sharp alternative.
   Themselves [autoi]. As a public acknowledgment that they had wronged
   and mistreated Paul and Silas. Let them come themselves and lead us out
   [exagagetOsan], third person plural second aorist active imperative of
   [exagO]. It was a bitter pill to the proud praetors.

   16:39 They feared [ephobethesan]. This is the explanation. They became
   frightened for their own lives when they saw what they had done to
   Roman citizens. They asked [erOtOn]. Imperfect active of [erOtaO]. They
   kept on begging them to leave for fear of further trouble. The
   colonists in Philippi would turn against the praetors if they learned
   the facts, proud as they were of being citizens. This verb in the Koine
   is often used as here to make a request and not just to ask a question.

   16:40 Into the house of Lydia [pros ten Ludian]. No word in the Greek
   for "house," but it means the house of Lydia. Note "the brethren" here,
   not merely Luke and Timothy, but other brethren now converted besides
   those in the house of the jailor. The four missionaries were guests of
   Lydia (verse 15) and probably the church now met in her home. They
   departed [exelthan]. Paul and Silas, but not Luke and Timothy. Note
   "they" here, not "we." Note also the [-an] ending instead of [-on] as
   above. The movements of Timothy are not perfectly clear till he
   reappears at Beroea (17:15). It seems unlikely that he came to
   Thessalonica with Paul and Silas since only Paul and Silas obtained
   security there (17:9) and were sent on to Beroea (17:10). Probably
   Timothy was sent to Thessalonica from Philippi with gifts of which Paul
   spoke later (Php 4:15f.). Then he followed Paul and Silas to Beroea.

Chapter 17

   17:1 When they had passed through [diodeusantes]. First aorist active
   participle of [diodeuO], common verb in the Koine (Polybius, Plutarch,
   LXX, etc.), but in the N.T. only here and Lu 8:1. It means literally to
   make one's way [hodos] through [dia]. They took the Egnatian Way, one
   of the great Roman roads from Byzantium to Dyrrachium (over 500 miles
   long) on the Adriatic Sea, opposite Brundisium and so an extension of
   the Appian Way. Amphipolis [ten Amphipolin]. So called because the
   Strymon flowed almost around [amphi] it, the metropolis of Macedonia
   Prima, a free city, about 32 miles from Philippi, about three miles
   from the sea. Paul and Silas may have spent only a night here or
   longer. Apollonia [ten ApollOnian]. Not the famous Apollonia in
   Illyria, but 32 miles from Amphipolis on the Egnatian Way. So here
   again a night was spent if no more. Why Paul hurried through these two
   large cities, if he did, we do not know. There are many gaps in Luke's
   narrative that we have no way of filling up. There may have been no
   synagogues for one thing. To Thessalonica [eis Thessaloniken]. There
   was a synagogue here in this great commercial city, still an important
   city called Saloniki, of 70,000 population. It was originally called
   Therma, at the head of the Thermaic Gulf. Cassander renamed it
   Thessalonica after his wife, the sister of Alexander the Great. It was
   the capital of the second of the four divisions of Macedonia and
   finally the capital of the whole province. It shared with Corinth and
   Ephesus the commerce of the Aegean. One synagogue shows that even in
   this commercial city the Jews were not very numerous. As a political
   centre it ranked with Antioch in Syria and Caesarea in Palestine. It
   was a strategic centre for the spread of the gospel as Paul later said
   for it sounded (echoed) forth from Thessalonica throughout Macedonia
   and Achaia (1Th 1:8).

   17:2 As his custom was [kata to eiOthos tOi PaulOi]. The same
   construction in Lu 4:16 about Jesus in Nazareth [kata to eiOthos autOi]
   with the second perfect active participle neuter singular from [ethO].
   Paul's habit was to go to the Jewish synagogue to use the Jews and the
   God-fearers as a springboard for his work among the Gentiles. For three
   Sabbaths [epi sabbata tria]. Probably the reference is to the first
   three Sabbaths when Paul had a free hand in the synagogue as at first
   in Antioch in Pisidia. Luke does not say that Paul was in Thessalonica
   only three weeks. He may have spoken there also during the week, though
   the Sabbath was the great day. Paul makes it plain, as Furneaux shows,
   that he was in Thessalonica a much longer period than three weeks. The
   rest of the time he spoke, of course, outside of the synagogue. Paul
   implies an extended stay by his language in 1Th 1:8. The church
   consisted mainly of Gentile converts (2Th 3:4, 7, 8) and seems to have
   been well organized (1Th 5:12). He received help while there several
   times from Philippi (Php 4:16) and even so worked night and day to
   support himself (1Th 2:9). His preaching was misunderstood there in
   spite of careful instruction concerning the second coming of Christ
   (1Th 4:13-5:5; 2Th 2:1-12). Reasoned [dielexato]. First aorist middle
   indicative of [dialegomai], old verb in the active to select,
   distinguish, then to revolve in the mind, to converse (interchange of
   ideas), then to teach in the Socratic ("dialectic") method of question
   and answer (cf. [dielegeto] in verse 17), then simply to discourse, but
   always with the idea of intellectual stimulus. With these Jews and
   God-fearers Paul appealed to the Scriptures as text and basis [apo] of
   his ideas.

   17:3 Opening and alleging [dianoigOn kai paratithemenos]. Opening the
   Scriptures, Luke means, as made plain by the mission and message of
   Jesus, the same word [dianoigO] used by him of the interpretation of
   the Scriptures by Jesus (Lu 24:32) and of the opening of the mind of
   the disciples also by Jesus (Lu 24:45) and of the opening of Lydia's
   heart by the Lord (16:14). One cannot refrain from saying that such
   exposition of the Scriptures as Jesus and Paul gave would lead to more
   opening of mind and heart. Paul was not only "expounding" the
   Scriptures, he was also "propounding" (the old meaning of "allege") his
   doctrine or setting forth alongside the Scriptures [para-tithemenos],
   quoting the Scripture to prove his contention which was made in much
   conflict (1Th 2:2), probably in the midst of heated discussion by the
   opposing rabbis who were anything but convinced by Paul's powerful
   arguments, for the Cross was a stumbling-block to the Jews (1Co 1:23).
   That it behoved the Christ to suffer [hoti ton Christon edei pathein].
   The second aorist active infinitive is the subject of [edei] with [ton
   Christon], the accusative of general reference. This is Paul's major
   premise in his argument from the Scriptures about the Messiah, the
   necessity of his sufferings according to the Scriptures, the very
   argument made by the Risen Jesus to the two on the way to Emmaus (Lu
   24:25-27). The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah was a passage in point
   that the rabbis had overlooked. Peter made the same point in Ac 3:18
   and Paul again in Ac 26:23. The minor premise is the resurrection of
   Jesus from the dead. To rise again from the dead [anastenai ek nekrOn].
   This second aorist active infinitive [anastenai] is also the subject of
   [edei]. The actual resurrection of Jesus was also a necessity as Paul
   says he preached to them (1Th 4:14) and argued always from Scripture
   (1Co 15:3-4) and from his own experience (Ac 9:22; 22:7; 26:8, 14; 1Co
   15:8). This Jesus is the Christ [houtos estin ho Christos, ho Iesous].
   More precisely, "This is the Messiah, viz., Jesus whom I am proclaiming
   unto you." This is the conclusion of Paul's line of argument and it is
   logical and overwhelming. It is his method everywhere as in Damascus,
   in Antioch in Pisidia, here, in Corinth. He spoke as an eye-witness.

   17:4 Some of them [tines ex autOn]. That is of the Jews who were
   evidently largely afraid of the rabbis. Still "some" were persuaded
   [epeisthesan], effective first aorist passive indicative) and
   "consorted with" [proseklerOthesan]. This latter verb is also first
   aorist passive indicative of [proskleroO], a common verb in late Greek
   (Plutarch, Lucian), but only here in the N.T., from [pros] and
   [kleros], to assign by lot. So then this small group of Jews were given
   Paul and Silas by God's grace. And of the devout Greeks a great
   multitude [tOn te sebomenOn HellenOn plethos polu]. These "God-fearers"
   among the Gentiles were less under the control of the jealous rabbis
   and so responded more readily to Paul's appeal. In 1Th 1:9 Paul
   expressly says that they had "turned to God from idols," proof that
   this church was mainly Gentile (cf. also 1Th 2:14). And of the chief
   women not a few [gunaikOn te tOn prOtOn ouk oligai]. Literally, "And of
   women the first not a few." That is, a large number of women of the
   very first rank in the city, probably devout women also like the men
   just before and like those in 13:50 in Antioch in Pisidia who along
   with "the first men of the city" were stirred up against Paul. Here
   these women were openly friendly to Paul's message, whether proselytes
   or Gentiles or Jewish wives of Gentiles as Hort holds. It is noteworthy
   that here, as in Philippi, leading women take a bold stand for Christ.
   In Macedonia women had more freedom than elsewhere. It is not to be
   inferred that all those converted belonged to the higher classes, for
   the industrial element was clearly large (1Th 4:11). In 2Co 8:2 Paul
   speaks of the deep poverty of the Macedonian churches, but with
   Philippi mainly in mind. Ramsay thinks that Paul won many of the
   heathen not affiliated at all with the synagogue. Certain it is that we
   must allow a considerable interval of time between verses 4, 5 to
   understand what Paul says in his Thessalonian Epistles.

   17:5 Moved with jealousy [zelOsantes]. Both our English words, zeal and
   jealousy, are from the Greek [zelos]. In 13:45 the Jews (rabbis) "were
   filled with jealousy" [eplesthesan zelou]. That is another way of
   saying the same thing as here. The success of Paul was entirely too
   great in both places to please the rabbis. So here is jealousy of
   Jewish preachers towards Christian preachers. It is always between men
   or women of the same profession or group. In 1Th 2:3-10 Paul hints at
   some of the slanders spread against him by these rabbis (deceivers,
   using words of flattery as men-pleasers, after vain-glory, greed of
   gain, etc.). Took unto them [proslabomenoi]. Second aorist middle
   (indirect, to themselves) participle of [proslambanO], old and common
   verb. Certain vile fellows of the rabble [tOn agoraiOn andras tinas
   ponerous]. The [agora] or market-place was the natural resort for those
   with nothing to do (Mt 20:4) like the court-house square today or
   various parks in our cities where bench-warmers flock. Plato
   (Protagoras 347 C) calls these [agoraioi] (common word, but in N.T.
   only here and 19:38) idlers or good-for-nothing fellows. They are in
   every city and such "bums" are ready for any job. The church in
   Thessalonica caught some of these peripatetic idlers (2Th 3:10f.)
   "doing nothing but doing about." So the Jewish preachers gather to
   themselves a choice collection of these market-loungers or loafers or
   wharf-rats. The Romans called them subrostrani (hangers round the
   rostrum or subbasilicari). Gathering a crowd [ochlopoiesantes].
   Literally, making or getting [poieO] a crowd [ochlos], a word not found
   elsewhere. Probably right in the [agora] itself where the rabbis could
   tell men their duties and pay them in advance. Instance Hyde Park in
   London with all the curious gatherings every day, Sunday afternoons in
   particular. Set the city on an uproar [ethoruboun]. Imperfect active of
   [thorubeO], from [thorubos] (tumult), old verb, but in the N.T. only
   here and 20:10; Mt 9:23; Mr 4:39. They kept up the din, this
   combination of rabbis and rabble. Assaulting the house of Jason
   [epistantes tei oikiai Iasonos]. Second aorist (ingressive) active of
   [ephistemi], taking a stand against, rushing at, because he was Paul's
   host. He may have been a Gentile (Jason the name of an ancient king of
   Thessaly), but the Jews often used it for Joshua or Jesus (II Macc.
   1:7). They sought [ezetoun]. Imperfect active. They burst into the
   house and searched up and down. Them [autous]. Paul and Silas. They
   were getting ready to have a lynching party.

   17:6 When they found them not [me heurontes]. Usual negative [me] with
   the participle in the Koine, second aorist (effective) active
   participle, complete failure with all the noise and "bums." They
   dragged [esuron]. Imperfect active, vivid picture, they were dragging
   (literally). See already 8:3; 16:19. If they could not find Paul, they
   could drag Jason his host and some other Christians whom we do not
   know. Before the rulers of the city [epi tous politarchas]. This word
   does not occur in Greek literature and used to be cited as an example
   of Luke's blunders. But now it is found in an inscription on an arch in
   the modern city preserved in the British Museum. It is also found in
   seventeen inscriptions (five from Thessalonica) where the word or the
   verb [politarcheO] occurs. It is a fine illustration of the historical
   accuracy of Luke in matters of detail. This title for city officers in
   Thessalonica, a free city, is correct. They were burgomasters or
   "rulers of the city." Crying [boOntes]. Yelling as if the house was on
   fire like the mob in Jerusalem (21:28). These that have turned the
   world upside down [hoi ten oikoumenen anastatOsantes]. The use of
   [oikoumenen] (supply [gen] or [chOran], the inhabited earth, present
   passive participle of [oikeO] means the Roman Empire, since it is a
   political charge, a natural hyperbole in their excitement, but the
   phrase occurs for the Roman Empire in Lu 2:1. It is possible that news
   had come to Thessalonica of the expulsion of the Jews from Rome by
   Claudius. There is truth in the accusation, for Christianity is
   revolutionary, but on this particular occasion the uproar (verse 5) was
   created by the rabbis and the hired loafers. The verb [anastatoO] (here
   first aorist active participle) does not occur in the ancient writers,
   but is in LXX and in Ac 17:6; 21:38; Ga 5:12. It occurs also in
   Harpocration (A.D. 4th cent.) and about 100 B.C. [exanastatoO] is found
   in a fragment of papyrus (Tebtunis no. 2) and in a Paris Magical
   Papyrus l. 2243f. But in an Egyptian letter of Aug. 4, 41 A.D.
   (Oxyrhynchus Pap. no. 119, 10) "the bad boy" uses it = "he upsets me"
   or " he drives me out of my senses" [anastatoi me]. See Deissmann,
   Light from the Ancient East, pp. 84f. It is not a "Biblical word" at
   all, but belongs to the current Koine. It is a vigorous and graphic
   term.

   17:7 Whom Jason hath received [hous hupodedektai IasOn]. Present
   perfect middle indicative of [hupodechomai], to entertain, old verb,
   but in N.T. only in Lu 10:38; 19:6; Ac 17:7; Jas 2:25. This is Jason's
   crime and he is the prisoner before the politarchs. These all [houtoi
   pantes]. Jason, the "brethren" of verse 6, Paul and Silas, and all
   Christians everywhere. Contrary [apenanti]. Late compound preposition
   [apo, en, anti] found in Polybius, LXX, here only in the N.T. The
   decrees of Caesar [tOn dogmatOn Kaisaros]. This was a charge of treason
   and was a sure way to get a conviction. Probably the Julian Leges
   Majestatis are in mind rather than the definite decree of Claudius
   about the Jews (Ac 18:2). Saying that there is another king, one Jesus
   [Basilea heteron legontes einai Iesoun]. Note the very order of the
   words in the Greek indirect discourse with the accusative and
   infinitive after [legontes]. [Basilea heteron] comes first, a different
   king, another emperor than Caesar. This was the very charge that the
   smart student of the Pharisees and Herodians had tried to catch Jesus
   on (Mr 12:14). The Sanhedrin made it anyhow against Jesus to Pilate (Lu
   23:2) and Pilate had to notice it. "Although the emperors never
   ventured to assume the title rex at Rome, in the Eastern provinces they
   were regularly termed basileus" (Page). The Jews here, as before Pilate
   (Joh 19:15), renounce their dearest hope of a Messianic king. It is
   plain that Paul had preached about Jesus as the Messiah, King of the
   Kingdom of God over against the Roman Empire, a spiritual kingdom, to
   be sure, but the Jews here turn his language to his hurt as they did
   with Jesus. As a matter of fact Paul's preaching about the kingdom and
   the second coming of Christ was gravely misunderstood by the Christians
   at Thessalonica after his departure (1Th 4:13-5:4; 2Th 2). The Jews
   were quick to seize upon his language about Jesus Christ to his own
   injury. Clearly here in Thessalonica Paul had faced the power of the
   Roman Empire in a new way and pictured over against it the grandeur of
   the reign of Christ.

   17:8 They troubled the multitude and the rulers [etaraxan ton ochlon
   kai tous politarchas]. First aorist active of [tarassO], old verb to
   agitate. The excitement of the multitude "agitated" the politarchs
   still more. To the people it meant a revolution, to the politarchs a
   charge of complicity in treason if they let it pass. They had no way to
   disprove the charge of treason and Paul and Silas were not present.

   17:9 When they had taken security [labontes to hikanon]. A Greek
   idiom=Latin satis accipere, to receive the sufficient (bond), usually
   money for the fulfilment of the judgment. Probably the demand was made
   of Jason that he see to it that Paul and Silas leave the city not to
   return. In 1Th 2:17f. Paul may refer to this in mentioning his
   inability to visit these Thessalonians again. The idiom [lambanein to
   hikanon] now is found in two inscriptions of the second century A.D.
   (O. G. I. S. 484, 50 and 629, 101). In Vol. III Oxyrhynchus Papyri no.
   294 A.D. 22 the corresponding phrase [dounai heikanon] ("to give
   security") appears. They let them go [apelusan autous]. The charge was
   serious but the proof slim so that the politarchs were glad to be rid
   of the case.

   17:10 Immediately by night [eutheOs dia nuktos]. Paul's work had not
   been in vain in Thessalonica (1Th 1:7f.; 2:13,20). Paul loved the
   church here. Two of them, Aristarchus and Secundus, will accompany him
   to Jerusalem (Ac 20:4) and Aristarchus will go on with him to Rome
   (27:2). Plainly Paul and Silas had been in hiding in Thessalonica and
   in real danger. After his departure severe persecution came to the
   Christians in Thessalonica (1Th 2:14; 3:1-5; 2Th 1:6). It is possible
   that there was an escort of Gentile converts with Paul and Silas on
   this night journey to Beroea which was about fifty miles southwest from
   Thessalonica near Pella in another district of Macedonia (Emathia).
   There is a modern town there of some 6,000 people. Went [apeiesan].
   Imperfect third plural active of [apeimi], old verb to go away, here
   alone in the N.T. A literary, almost Atticistic, form instead of
   [apelthon]. Into the synagogue of the Jews [eis ten sunagOgen tOn
   IoudaiOn]. Paul's usual custom and he lost no time about it. Enough
   Jews here to have a synagogue.

   17:11 More noble than those [eugenesteroi tOn]. Comparative form of
   [eugenes], old and common adjective, but in N.T. only here and Lu
   19:12; 1Co 1:26. Followed by ablative case [tOn] as often after the
   comparative. With all readiness of mind [meta pases prothumias]. Old
   word from [prothumos] [pro, thumos] and means eagerness, rushing
   forward. In the N.T. only here and 2Co 8:11-19; 9:2. In Thessalonica
   many of the Jews out of pride and prejudice refused to listen. Here the
   Jews joyfully welcomed the two Jewish visitors. Examining the
   Scriptures daily [kath' hemeran anakrinontes tas graphas]. Paul
   expounded the Scriptures daily as in Thessalonica, but the Beroeans,
   instead of resenting his new interpretation, examined [anakrinO] means
   to sift up and down, make careful and exact research as in legal
   processes as in Ac 4:9; 12:19, etc.) the Scriptures for themselves. In
   Scotland people have the Bible open on the preacher as he expounds the
   passage, a fine habit worth imitating. Whether these things were so [ei
   echoi tauta houtOs]. Literally, "if these things had it thus." The
   present optative in the indirect question represents an original
   present indicative as in Lu 1:29 (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1043f.). This
   use of [ei] with the optative may be looked at as the condition of the
   fourth class (undetermined with less likelihood of determination) as in
   Ac 17:27; 20:16; 24:19; 27:12 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1021). The
   Beroeans were eagerly interested in the new message of Paul and Silas
   but they wanted to see it for themselves. What a noble attitude. Paul's
   preaching made Bible students of them. The duty of private
   interpretation is thus made plain (Hovey).

   17:12 Many therefore [Polloi men oun]. As a result of this Bible study.
   Also of the Greek women of honourable estate. The word [Hellenis] means
   Greek woman, but the word [gune] is added. In particular women of rank
   [euschemonOn], from [eu] and [echO], graceful figure and the honourable
   standing) as in 13:50 (Mr 15:43). Probably Luke means by implication
   that the "men" [andrOn] were also noble Greeks though he does not
   expressly say so. So then the Jews were more open to the message, the
   proselytes or God-fearers followed suit, with "not a few" [ouk oligoi]
   real Greeks (both men and women) believing. It was quick and fine work.

   17:13 Was proclaimed [kateggele]. Second aorist passive indicative of
   [kataggellO], common late verb as in Ac 16:21. Of Paul [hupo Paulou].
   By Paul, of course. Stirring up and troubling the multitudes
   [saleuontes kai tarassontes tous ochlous]. Shaking the crowds like an
   earthquake (4:31) and disturbing like a tornado (17:8). Success at
   Thessalonica gave the rabbis confidence and courage. The attack was
   sharp and swift. The Jews from Antioch in Pisidia had likewise pursued
   Paul to Iconium and Lystra. How long Paul had been in Beroea Luke does
   not say. But a church was established here which gave a good account of
   itself later and sent a messenger (Ac 20:4) with their part of the
   collection to Jerusalem. This quiet and noble town was in a whirl of
   excitement over the attacks of the Jewish emissaries from Thessalonica
   who probably made the same charge of treason against Paul and Silas.

   17:14 And then immediately [eutheOs de tote]. They acted swiftly as in
   Thessalonica. Sent forth [exapesteilan]. Double compound [ex, apo],
   both out and away) common in late Greek. First aorist active indicative
   [exapostellO], liquid verb). Same form in 9:30. As far as to the sea
   [heOs epi ten thalassan]. It is not clear whether Paul went all the way
   to Athens by land or took ship at Dium or Pydna, some sixteen miles
   away, and sailed to Athens. Some even think that Paul gave the Jews the
   slip and went all the way by land when they expected him to go by sea.
   At any rate we know that Paul was grieved to cut short his work in
   Macedonia, probably not over six months in all, which had been so
   fruitful in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea. Silas and Timothy (note
   his presence) remained behind in Beroea and they would keep the work
   going. Paul no doubt hoped to return soon. Silas and Timothy in Beroea
   would also serve to screen his flight for the Jews wanted his blood,
   not theirs. The work in Macedonia spread widely (1Th 1:7f.).

   17:15 But they that conducted Paul [hoi de kathistanontes ton Paulon].
   Articular present active participle of [kathistanO] (late form in A B
   of [kathistemi] or [kathistaO], an old verb with varied uses to put
   down, to constitute, to conduct, etc. This use here is in the LXX (Jos
   6:23) and old Greek also. To Athens [heOs AthenOn]. To make sure of his
   safe arrival. That they should come to him with all speed [hina hOs
   tachista elthOsin pros auton]. Note the neat Greek idiom [hOs tachista]
   as quickly as possible (good Attic idiom). The indirect command and
   purpose [hina-elthOsin], second aorist active subjunctive) is also neat
   Greek (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1046). Departed [exeiesan]. Imperfect
   active of [exeimi], old Greek word, but rare in N.T. All in Acts
   (13:42; 17:15; 20:7; 27:43)

   17:16 Now while Paul waited for them in Athens [En de tais Athenais
   ekdechomenou autous tou Paulou]. Genitive absolute with present middle
   participle of [ekdechomai], old verb to receive, but only with the
   sense of looking out for, expecting found here and elsewhere in N.T We
   know that Timothy did come to Paul in Athens (1Th 3:1, 6) from
   Thessalonica and was sent back to them from Athens. If Silas also came
   to Athens, he was also sent away, possibly to Philippi, for that church
   was deeply interested in Paul. At any rate both Timothy and Silas came
   from Macedonia to Corinth with messages and relief for Paul (Ac 18:5;
   2Co 11:8f.). Before they came and after they left, Paul felt lonely in
   Athens (1Th 3:1), the first time on this tour or the first that he has
   been completely without fellow workers. Athens had been captured by
   Sulla B.C. 86. After various changes Achaia, of which Corinth is the
   capital, is a separate province from Macedonia and A.D. 44 was restored
   by Claudius to the Senate with the Proconsul at Corinth. Paul is
   probably here about A.D. 50. Politically Athens is no longer of
   importance when Paul comes though it is still the university seat of
   the world with all its rich environment and traditions. Rackham grows
   eloquent over Paul the Jew of Tarsus being in the city of Pericles and
   Demosthenes, Socrates and Plato and Aristotle, Sophocles and Euripides.
   In its Agora Socrates had taught, here was the Academy of Plato, the
   Lyceum of Aristotle, the Porch of Zeno, the Garden of Epicurus. Here
   men still talked about philosophy, poetry, politics, religion, anything
   and everything. It was the art centre of the world. The Parthenon, the
   most beautiful of temples, crowned the Acropolis. Was Paul insensible
   to all this cultural environment? It is hard to think so for he was a
   university man of Tarsus and he makes a number of allusions to Greek
   writers. Probably it had not been in Paul's original plan to evangelize
   Athens, difficult as all university seats are, but he cannot be idle
   though here apparently by chance because driven out of Macedonia. Was
   provoked [parOxuneto]. Imperfect passive of [paroxunO], old verb to
   sharpen, to stimulate, to irritate (from [para, oxus], from
   [paroxusmos] (Ac 15:39), common in old Greek, but in N.T. only here and
   1Co 13:5. It was a continual challenge to Paul's spirit when he beheld
   [theOrountos], genitive of present participle agreeing with [autou]
   (his), though late MSS. have locative [theOrounti] agreeing with [en
   autOi]. The city full of idols [kateidOlon ousan ten polin]. Note the
   participle [ousan] not preserved in the English (either the city being
   full of idols or that the city was full of idols, sort of indirect
   discourse). Paul, like any stranger was looking at the sights as he
   walked around. This adjective [kateidOlon] (perfective use of [kata]
   and [eidOlon] is found nowhere else, but it is formed after the analogy
   of [katampelos, katadendron], full of idols. Xenophon (de Republ. Ath.)
   calls the city [hole bomos, hole thuma theois kai anathema] (all altar,
   all sacrifice and offering to the gods). These statues were beautiful,
   but Paul was not deceived by the mere art for art's sake. The idolatry
   and sensualism of it all glared at him (Ro 1:18-32). Renan ridicules
   Paul's ignorance in taking these statues for idols, but Paul knew
   paganism better than Renan. The superstition of this centre of Greek
   culture was depressing to Paul. One has only to recall how
   superstitious cults today flourish in the atmosphere of Boston and Los
   Angeles to understand conditions in Athens. Pausanias says that Athens
   had more images than all the rest of Greece put together. Pliny states
   that in the time of Nero Athens had over 30,000 public statues besides
   countless private ones in the homes. Petronius sneers that it was
   easier to find a god than a man in Athens. Every gateway or porch had
   its protecting god. They lined the street from the Piraeus and caught
   the eye at every place of prominence on wall or in the agora.

   17:17 So he reasoned [dielegeto men oun]. Accordingly therefore, with
   his spirit stirred by the proof of idolatry. Imperfect middle of
   [dialegO], same verb used in verse 2 which see. First he reasoned in
   the synagogue at the services to the Jews and the God-fearers, then
   daily in the agora or marketplace (southwest of the Acropolis, between
   it and the Areopagus and the Pnyx) to the chance-comers, "them that met
   him" [pros tous paratugchanontas]. Simultaneously with the synagogue
   preaching at other hours Paul took his stand like Socrates before him
   and engaged in conversation with [pros] those who happened by. This old
   verb, [paratugchanO], occurs here alone in the N.T. and accurately
   pictures the life in the agora. The listeners to Paul in the agora
   would be more casual than those who stop for street preaching, a
   Salvation Army meeting, a harangue from a box in Hyde Park. It was a
   slim chance either in synagogue or in agora, but Paul could not remain
   still with all the reeking idolatry around him. The boundaries of the
   agora varied, but there was always the [Poikile Stoa] (the Painted
   Porch), over against the Acropolis on the west. In this [Stoa] (Porch)
   Zeno and other philosophers and rhetoricians held forth from time to
   time. Paul may have stood near this spot.

   17:18 And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers
   encountered him [tines de kai tOn EpikouriOn kai StOikOn philosophOn
   suneballon autOi]. Imperfect active of [sunballO], old verb, in the
   N.T. only by Luke, to bring or put together in one's mind (Lu 2:19), to
   meet together (Ac 20:14), to bring together aid (18:27), to confer or
   converse or dispute as here and already 4:15 which see. These
   professional philosophers were always ready for an argument and so they
   frequented the agora for that purpose. Luke uses one article and so
   groups the two sects together in their attitude toward Paul, but they
   were very different in fact. Both sects were eager for argument and
   both had disdain for Paul, but they were the two rival practical
   philosophies of the day, succeeding the more abstruse theories of Plato
   and Aristotle. Socrates had turned men's thought inward [GnOthi
   Seauton], Know Thyself) away from the mere study of physics. Plato
   followed with a profound development of the inner self (metaphysics).
   Aristotle with his cyclopaedic grasp sought to unify and relate both
   physics and metaphysics. Both Zeno and Epicurus (340-272 B.C.) took a
   more practical turn in all this intellectual turmoil and raised the
   issues of everyday life. Zeno (360-260 B.C.) taught in the [Stoa]
   (Porch) and so his teaching was called Stoicism. He advanced many noble
   ideas that found their chief illustration in the Roman philosophers
   (Seneca, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius). He taught self-mastery and
   hardness with an austerity that ministered to pride or suicide in case
   of failure, a distinctly selfish and unloving view of life and with a
   pantheistic philosophy. Epicurus considered practical atheism the true
   view of the universe and denied a future life and claimed pleasure as
   the chief thing to be gotten out of life. He did not deny the existence
   of gods, but regarded them as unconcerned with the life of men. The
   Stoics called Epicurus an atheist. Lucretius and Horace give the
   Epicurean view of life in their great poems. This low view of life led
   to sensualism and does today, for both Stoicism and Epicureanism are
   widely influential with people now. "Eat and drink for tomorrow we
   die," they preached. Paul had doubtless become acquainted with both of
   these philosophies for they were widely prevalent over the world. Here
   he confronts them in their very home. He is challenged by past-masters
   in the art of appealing to the senses, men as skilled in their
   dialectic as the Pharisaic rabbis with whom Paul had been trained and
   whose subtleties he had learned how to expose. But, so far as we know,
   this is a new experience for Paul to have a public dispute with these
   philosophical experts who had a natural contempt for all Jews and for
   rabbis in particular, though they found Paul a new type at any rate and
   so with some interest in him. "In Epicureanism, it was man's sensual
   nature which arrayed itself against the claims of the gospel; in
   Stoicism it was his self-righteousness and pride of intellect"
   (Hackett). Knowling calls the Stoic the Pharisee of philosophy and the
   Epicurean the Sadducee of philosophy. Socrates in this very agora used
   to try to interest the passers-by in some desire for better things.
   That was 450 years before Paul is challenged by these superficial
   sophistical Epicureans and Stoics. It is doubtful if Paul had ever met
   a more difficult situation. What would this babbler say? [Ti an theloi
   ho spermologos houtos legein?]. The word for "babbler" means
   "seed-picker" or picker up of seeds [sperma], seed, [legO], to collect)
   like a bird in the agora hopping about after chance seeds. Plutarch
   applies the word to crows that pick up grain in the fields. Demosthenes
   called Aeschines a [spermologos]. Eustathius uses it of a man hanging
   around in the markets picking up scraps of food that fell from the
   carts and so also of mere rhetoricians and plagiarists who picked up
   scraps of wisdom from others. Ramsay considers it here a piece of
   Athenian slang used to describe the picture of Paul seen by these
   philosophers who use it, for not all of them had it ("some," [tines].
   Note the use of [an] and the present active optative [theloi],
   conclusion of a fourth-class condition in a rhetorical question
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1021). It means, What would this picker up of
   seeds wish to say, if he should get off an idea? It is a contemptuous
   tone of supreme ridicule and doubtless Paul heard this comment.
   Probably the Epicureans made this sneer that Paul was a charlatan or
   quack. Other some [hoi de]. But others, in contrast with the "some"
   just before. Perhaps the Stoics take this more serious view of Paul. He
   seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods [zenOn daimoniOn dokei
   kataggeleus einai]. This view is put cautiously by [dokei] (seems).
   [Kataggeleus] does not occur in the old Greek, though in ecclesiastical
   writers, but Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, p. 99) gives an
   example of the word "on a marble stele recording a decree of the
   Mitylenaens in honour of the Emperor Augustus," where it is the herald
   of the games. Here alone in the N.T. [Daimonion] is used in the old
   Greek sense of deity or divinity whether good or bad, not in the N.T.
   sense of demons. Both this word and [kataggeleus] are used from the
   Athenian standpoint. [Xenos] is an old word for a guest-friend (Latin
   hospes) and then host (Ro 16:23), then for foreigner or stranger (Mt
   25:31; Ac 17:21), new and so strange as here and Heb 13:9; 1Pe 4:12,
   and then aliens (Eph 2:12). This view of Paul is the first count
   against Socrates: Socrates does wrong, introducing new deities [adikei
   SOkrates, kaina daimonia eispherOn], Xen. Mem. I). On this charge the
   Athenians voted the hemlock for their greatest citizen. What will they
   do to Paul? This Athens was more sceptical and more tolerant than the
   old Athens. But Roman law did not allow the introduction of a new
   religion (religio illicita). Paul was walking on thin ice though he was
   the real master philosopher and these Epicureans and Stoics were
   quacks. Paul had the only true philosophy of the universe and life with
   Jesus Christ as the centre (Col 1:12-20), the greatest of all
   philosophers as Ramsay justly terms him. But these men are mocking him.
   Because he preached Jesus and the resurrection [hoti ton Iesoun kai ten
   anastasin eueggelizato]. Reason for the view just stated. Imperfect
   middle indicative of [euaggelizO], to "gospelize." Apparently these
   critics considered [anastasis] (Resurrection) another deity on a par
   with Jesus. The Athenians worshipped all sorts of abstract truths and
   virtues and they misunderstood Paul on this subject. They will leave
   him as soon as he mentions the resurrection (verse 32). It is objected
   that Luke would not use the word in this sense here for his readers
   would not under stand him. But Luke is describing the misapprehension
   of this group of philosophers and this interpretation fits in
   precisely.

   17:19 And they took hold of him [epilabomenoi de autou]. Second aorist
   middle participle of [epilambanO], old verb, but in the N.T. only in
   the middle, here with the genitive [autou] to lay hold of, but with no
   necessary sense of violence (Ac 9:27; 23:27; Mr 8:23), unless the idea
   is that Paul was to be tried before the Court of Areopagus for the
   crime of bringing in strange gods. But the day for that had passed in
   Athens. Even so it is not clear whether "unto the Areopagus [epi ton
   Areion Pagon]") means the Hill of Mars (west of the Acropolis, north of
   the agora and reached by a flight of steps in the rock) or the court
   itself which met elsewhere as well as on the hills, usually in fact in
   the Stoa Basilica opening on the agora and near to the place where the
   dispute had gone on. Raphael's cartoon with Paul standing on Mars Hill
   has made us all familiar with the common view, but it is quite
   uncertain if it is true. There was not room on the summit for a large
   gathering. If Paul was brought before the Court of Areopagus (commonly
   called the Areopagus as here), it was not for trial as a criminal, but
   simply for examination concerning his new teaching in this university
   city whether it was strictly legal or not. Paul was really engaged in
   proselytism to turn the Athenians away from their old gods to Jesus
   Christ. But "the court of refined and polished Athenians was very
   different from the rough provincial magistrates of Philippi, and the
   philosophers who presented Paul to their cognizance very different from
   the mob of Thessalonians" (Rackham). It was all very polite. May we
   know? [Dunametha gnOnai]. Can we come to know (ingressive second aorist
   active infinitive). This new teaching [he kaine haute didache]. On the
   position of [haute] see Robertson, Grammar, pp. 700f. The question was
   prompted by courtesy, sarcasm, or irony. Evidently no definite charge
   was laid against Paul.

   17:20 For thou bringest certain strange things [xenizonta gar tina
   eisphereis]. The very verb used by Xenophon (Mem. I) about Socrates.
   [Xenizonta] is present active neuter plural participle of [xenizO] and
   from [xenos] (verse 18), "things surprising or shocking us." We would
   know therefore [boulometha oun gnOnai]. Very polite still, we wish or
   desire, and repeating [gnOnai] (the essential point).

   17:21 Spent their time [eukairoun]. Imperfect active of [eukaireO]. A
   late word to have opportunity [eu, kairos] from Polybius on. In the
   N.T. only here and Mr 6:31. They had time for,.etc. This verse is an
   explanatory parenthesis by Luke. Some new thing [ti kainoteron].
   Literally "something newer" or "fresher" than the new, the very latest,
   the comparative of [kainos]. Demosthenes (Philipp. 1. 43) pictures the
   Athenians "in the agora inquiring if anything newer is said"
   [punthanomenoi kata ten agoran ei ti legetai neOteron]. The new soon
   became stale with these itching and frivolous Athenians.

   17:22 Stood in the midst of the Areopagus [statheis en mesOi tou Areiou
   Pagou]. First aorist passive of [histemi] used of Peter in 2:14.
   Majestic figure whether on Mars Hill or in the Stoa Basilica before the
   Areopagus Court. There would be a crowd of spectators and philosophers
   in either case and Paul seized the opportunity to preach Christ to this
   strange audience as he did in Caesarea before Herod Agrippa and the
   crowd of prominent people gathered by Festus for the entertainment.
   Paul does not speak as a man on trial, but as one trying to get a
   hearing for the gospel of Christ. Somewhat superstitious [hOs
   deisidaimonesterous]. The Authorized Version has "too superstitious,"
   the American Standard "very religious." [DeisidaimOn] is a neutral word
   (from [deidO], to fear, and [daimOn], deity). The Greeks used it either
   in the good sense of pious or religious or the bad sense of
   superstitious. Thayer suggests that Paul uses it "with kindly
   ambiguity." Page thinks that Luke uses the word to represent the
   religious feeling of the Athenians (religiosus) which bordered on
   superstition. The Vulgate has superstitiosiores. In 25:19 Festus uses
   the term [deisidaimonia] for "religion." It seems unlikely that Paul
   should give this audience a slap in the face at the very start. The way
   one takes this adjective here colours Paul's whole speech before the
   Council of Areopagus. The comparative here as in verse 21 means more
   religions than usual (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 664f.), the object of the
   comparison not being expressed. The Athenians had a tremendous
   reputation for their devotion to religion, "full of idols" (verse 16).

   17:23 For [gar]. Paul gives an illustration of their religiousness from
   his own experiences in their city. The objects of your worship [ta
   sebasmata humOn]. Late word from [sebazomai], to worship. In N T. only
   here and 2Th 2:4. The use of this word for temples, altars, statues,
   shows the conciliatory tone in the use of [deisidaimonesterous] in
   verse 22. An altar [bOmon]. Old word, only here in the N.T. and the
   only mention of a heathen altar in the N.T With this inscription [en
   hOi epegegrapto]. On which had been written (stood written), past
   perfect passive indicative of [epigraphO], old and common verb for
   writing on inscriptions [epigraphe], Lu 23:38). To an Unknown God
   [AGNOSTO THEO]. Dative case, dedicated to. Pausanias (I. 1, 4) says
   that in Athens there are "altars to gods unknown" [bOmoi theOn
   agnOstOn]. Epimenides in a pestilence advised the sacrifice of a sheep
   to the befitting god whoever he might be. If an altar was dedicated to
   the wrong deity, the Athenians feared the anger of the other gods. The
   only use in the N.T. of [agnOstos], old and common adjective (from [a]
   privative and [gnOstos] verbal of [ginOskO], to know). Our word
   agnostic comes from it. Here it has an ambiguous meaning, but Paul uses
   it though to a stern Christian philosopher it may be the "confession at
   once of a bastard philosophy and of a bastard religion" (Hort, Hulsean
   Lectures, p. 64). Paul was quick to use this confession on the part of
   the Athenians of a higher power than yet known to them. So he gets his
   theme from this evidence of a deeper religious sense in them and makes
   a most clever use of it with consummate skill. In ignorance
   [agnoountes]. Present active participle of [agnoeO], old verb from same
   root as [agnOstos] to which Paul refers by using it. This set I forth
   unto you [touto ego kataggellO humin]. He is a [kataggeleus] (verse 18)
   as they suspected of a God, both old and new, old in that they already
   worship him, new in that Paul knows who he is. By this master stroke he
   has brushed to one side any notion of violation of Roman law or
   suspicion of heresy and claims their endorsement of his new gospel, a
   shrewd and consummate turn. He has their attention now and proceeds to
   describe this God left out of their list as the one true and Supreme
   God. The later MSS. here read [hon--touton] (whom--this one) rather
   than [ho--touto] (what--this), but the late text is plainly an effort
   to introduce too soon the personal nature of God which comes out
   clearly in verse 24.

   17:24 The God that made the world [Ho theos ho poiesas ton kosmon]. Not
   a god for this and a god for that like the 30,000 gods of the
   Athenians, but the one God who made the Universe [kosmos] on the old
   Greek sense of orderly arrangement of the whole universe). And all
   things therein [kai panta ta en autOi]. All the details in the universe
   were created by this one God. Paul is using the words of Isa 42:5. The
   Epicureans held that matter was eternal. Paul sets them aside. This one
   God was not to be confounded with any of their numerous gods save with
   this "Unknown God." Being Lord of heaven and earth [ouranou kai ges
   huparchOn kurios]. [Kurios] here owner, absolute possessor of both
   heaven and earth (Isa 45:7), not of just parts. Dwelleth not in temples
   made with hands [ouken cheiropoietois naois katoikei]. The old
   adjective [cheiropoietos] [cheir, poieO] already in Stephen's speech
   (7:48). No doubt Paul pointed to the wonderful Parthenon, supposed to
   be the home of Athene as Stephen denied that God dwelt alone in the
   temple in Jerusalem.

   17:25 As though he needed anything [prosdeomenos tinos]. Present middle
   participle of [prosdeomai], to want besides, old verb, but here only in
   the N.T. This was strange doctrine for the people thought that the gods
   needed their offerings for full happiness. This self-sufficiency of God
   was taught by Philo and Lucretius, but Paul shows that the Epicurean
   missed it by putting God, if existing at all, outside the universe.
   Seeing he himself giveth to all [autos didous pasin]. This Supreme
   Personal God is the source of life, breath, and everything. Paul here
   rises above all Greek philosophers.

   17:26 And he made of one [epoiesen te ex henos]. The word [haimatos]
   (blood) is absent from Aleph A B and is a later explanatory addition.
   What Paul affirms is the unity of the human race with a common origin
   and with God as the Creator. This view runs counter to Greek
   exclusiveness which treated other races as barbarians and to Jewish
   pride which treated other nations as heathen or pagan (the Jews were
   [laos], the Gentiles [ethne]. The cosmopolitanism of Paul here rises
   above Jew and Greek and claims the one God as the Creator of the one
   race of men. The Athenians themselves claimed to be [antochthonous]
   (indigenous) and a special creation. Zeno and Seneca did teach a kind
   of cosmopolitanism (really pantheism) far different from the personal
   God of Paul. It was Rome, not Greece, that carried out the moral ideas
   of Zeno. Man is part of the universe (verse 24) and God created
   [epoiesen] man as he created [poiesas] the all. For to dwell
   [katoikein]. Infinitive (present active) of purpose, so as to dwell.
   Having determined [horisas]. First aorist active participle of
   [horizO], old verb to make a horizon as already in 19:42 which see.
   Paul here touches God's Providence. God has revealed himself in history
   as in creation. His hand appears in the history of all men as well as
   in that of the Chosen People of Israel. Appointed seasons
   [prostetagmenous kairous]. Not the weather as in 14:17, but "the times
   of the Gentiles" [kairoi ethnOn] of which Jesus spoke (Lu 21:24). The
   perfect passive participle of [prostassO], old verb to enjoin,
   emphasizes God's control of human history without any denial of human
   free agency as was involved in the Stoic Fate [Heirmarmene]. Bounds
   [horothesias]. Limits? Same idea in Job 12:23. Nations rise and fall,
   but it is not blind chance or hard fate. Thus there is an interplay
   between God's will and man's activities, difficult as it is for us to
   see with our shortened vision.

   17:27 That they should seek God [Zetein ton theon]. Infinitive (present
   active) of purpose again. Seek him, not turn away from him as the
   nations had done (Ro 1:18-32). If haply they might feel after him [ei
   ara ge pselapheseian auton]. First aorist active (Aeolic form) optative
   of [pselaphaO], old verb from [psaO], to touch. So used by the Risen
   Jesus in his challenge to the disciples (Lu 24:39), by the Apostle John
   of his personal contact with Jesus (1Jo 1:1), of the contact with Mount
   Sinai (Heb 12:18). Here it pictures the blind groping of the darkened
   heathen mind after God to "find him" [heuroien], second aorist active
   optative) whom they had lost. One knows what it is in a darkened room
   to feel along the walls for the door (De 28:29; Job 5:14; 12:25; Isa
   59:10). Helen Keller, when told of God, said that she knew of him
   already, groping in the dark after him. The optative here with [ei] is
   due to the condition of the fourth class (undetermined, but with vague
   hope of being determined) with aim also present (Robertson, Grammar, p.
   1021). Note also [ara ge] the inferential particle [ara] with the
   delicate intensive particle [ge]. Though he is not far from each one of
   us [kai ge ou makran apo henos hekastou hemOn huparchonta]. More
   exactly with B L [kai ge] instead of [kaitoi] or [kaitoi ge], "and yet
   being not far from each one of us," a direct statement rather than a
   concessive one. The participle [huparchonta] agrees with [auton] and
   the negative [ou] rather than the usual [me] with the participle makes
   an emphatic negative. Note also the intensive particle [ge].

   17:28 For in him [en autOi gar]. Proof of God's nearness, not stoic
   pantheism, but real immanence in God as God dwells in us. The three
   verbs [zOmen, kinoumetha, esmen] form an ascending scale and reach a
   climax in God (life, movement, existence). [Kinoumetha] is either
   direct middle present indicative (we move ourselves) or passive (we are
   moved). As certain even of your own poets [hOs kai tines tOn kath'
   humas poietOn]. "As also some of the poets among you." Aratus of Soli
   in Cilicia (ab. B.C. 270) has these very words in his Ta Phainomena and
   Cleanthes, Stoic philosopher (300-220 B.C.) in his Hymn to Zeus has [Ek
   sou gar genos esmen]. In 1Co 15:32 Paul quotes from Menander and in Tit
   1:12 from Epimenides. J. Rendel Harris claims that he finds allusions
   in Paul's Epistles to Pindar, Aristophanes, and other Greek writers.
   There is no reason in the world why Paul should not have acquaintance
   with Greek literature, though one need not strain a point to prove it.
   Paul, of course, knew that the words were written of Zeus (Jupiter),
   not of Jehovah, but he applies the idea in them to his point just made
   that all men are the offspring of God.

   17:29 We ought not to think [ouk opheilomen nomizein]. It is a logical
   conclusion [oun], therefore) from the very language of Aratus and
   Cleanthes. That the Godhead is like [to theion einai homoion].
   Infinitive with accusative of general reference in indirect discourse.
   [To theion] is strictly "the divine" nature like [theiotes] (Ro 1:20)
   rather than like [theotes] (Col 2:9). Paul may have used [to theion]
   here to get back behind all their notions of various gods to the real
   nature of God. The Athenians may even have used the term themselves.
   After [homoios] (like) the associative instrumental case is used as
   with [chrusOi, argurOi, lithOi]. Graven by art and device of man
   [charagmati technes kai enthumeseOs anthrOpou]. Apposition with
   preceding and so [charagmati] in associative instrumental case.
   Literally, graven work or sculpture from [charassO], to engrave, old
   word, but here alone in N.T. outside of Revelation (the mark of the
   beast). Graven work of art [technes] or external craft, and of thought
   or device [enthumeseOs] or internal conception of man.

   17:30 The times of ignorance [tous chronous tes agnoias]. The times
   before full knowledge of God came in Jesus Christ. Paul uses the very
   word for their ignorance [agnoountes] employed in verse 23. Overlooked
   [huperidOn]. Second aorist active participle of [huperoraO] or
   [hupereidO], old verb to see beyond, not to see, to overlook, not "to
   wink at" of the Authorized Version with the notion of condoning. Here
   only in the N.T. It occurs in the LXX in the sense of overlooking or
   neglecting (Ps 18:62; 55:1). But it has here only a negative force. God
   has all the time objected to the polytheism of the heathen, and now he
   has made it plain. In Wisdom 11:23 we have these words: "Thou
   overlookest the sins of men to the end they may repent." But now [ta
   nun]. Accusative of general reference, "as to the now things or
   situation." All is changed now that Christ has come with the full
   knowledge of God. See also 27:22. All everywhere [pantas pantachou]. No
   exceptions anywhere. Repent [metanoein]. Present active infinitive of
   [metanoeO] in indirect command, a permanent command of perpetual force.
   See on [metanoeO] Ac 2:38 and the Synoptic Gospels. This word was the
   message of the Baptist, of Jesus, of Peter, of Paul, this radical
   change of attitude and life.

   17:31 Inasmuch as [kathoti]. According as [kata, hoti]. Old causal
   conjunction, but in N.T. only used in Luke's writings (Lu 1:7; 19:9; Ac
   2:45; 4:35; 17:31). Hath appointed a day [estesen hemeran] First aorist
   active indicative of [histemi], to place, set. God did set the day in
   his counsel and he will fulfil it in his own time. Will judge [mellei
   krinein]. Rather, is going to judge, [mellO] and the present active
   infinitive of [krinO]. Paul here quotes Ps 9:8 where [krinei] occurs.
   By the man whom he hath ordained [en andri hOi hOrisen]. Here he adds
   to the Psalm the place and function of Jesus Christ, a passage in
   harmony with Christ's own words in Mt 25. [HOi] (whom) is attracted
   from the accusative, object of [hOrisen] (first aorist active
   indicative of [horizO] to the case of the antecedent [andri]. It has
   been said that Paul left the simple gospel in this address to the
   council of the Areopagus for philosophy. But did he? He skilfully
   caught their attention by reference to an altar to an Unknown God whom
   he interprets to be the Creator of all things and all men who overrules
   the whole world and who now commands repentance of all and has revealed
   his will about a day of reckoning when Jesus Christ will be Judge. He
   has preached the unity of God, the one and only God, has proclaimed
   repentance, a judgment day, Jesus as the Judge as shown by his
   Resurrection, great fundamental doctrines, and doubtless had much more
   to say when they interrupted his address. There is no room here for
   such a charge against Paul. He rose to a great occasion and made a
   masterful exposition of God's place and power in human history. Whereof
   he hath given assurance [pistin paraschOn]. Second aorist active
   participle of [parechO], old verb to furnish, used regularly by
   Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence. Note this old use of
   [pistis] as conviction or ground of confidence (Heb 11:1) like a note
   or title-deed, a conviction resting on solid basis of fact. All the
   other uses of [pistis] grow out of this one from [peithO], to persuade.
   In that he hath raised him from the dead [anastesas auton ek nekrOn].
   First aorist active participle of [anistemi], causal participle, but
   literally, "having raised him from the dead." This Paul knew to be a
   fact because he himself had seen the Risen Christ. Paul has here come
   to the heart of his message and could now throw light on their
   misapprehension about "Jesus and the Resurrection" (verse 18). Here
   Paul has given the proof of all his claims in the address that seemed
   new and strange to them.

   17:32 The resurrection of the dead [anastasin nekrOn]. Rather, "a
   resurrection of dead men." No article with either word. The Greeks
   believed that the souls of men lived on, but they had no conception of
   resurrection of the body. They had listened with respect till Paul
   spoke of the actual resurrection of Jesus from the dead as a fact, when
   they did not care to hear more. Some mocked [hoi men echleuazon].
   Imperfect active of [chleuazO], a common verb (from [chleue], jesting,
   mockery). Only here in the N.T. though late MSS. have it in 2:13 (best
   MSS. [diachleuazO]. Probably inchoative here, began to mock. In
   contempt at Paul's statement they declined to listen further to "this
   babbler" (verse 18) who had now lost what he had gained with this group
   of hearers (probably the light and flippant Epicureans). But others
   [hoi de]. A more polite group like those who had invited him to speak
   (verse 19). They were unconvinced, but had better manners and so were
   in favour of an adjournment. This was done, though it is not clear
   whether it was a serious postponement or a courteous refusal to hear
   Paul further (probably this). It was a virtual dismissal of the matter.
   " It is a sad story--the noblest of ancient cities and the noblest man
   of history--and he never cared to look on it again" (Furneaux).

   17:33 Thus Paul went out from among them [houtOs ho Paulos exelthen ek
   mesou autOn]. No further questions, no effort to arrest him, no further
   ridicule. He walked out never to return to Athens. Had he failed?

   17:34 Clave unto him and believed [kollethentes autOi episteusan].
   First aorist passive of this strong word [kollaO], to glue to, common
   in Acts (5:13; 8:29; 9:26; 10:28) No sermon is a failure which leads a
   group of men [andres] to believe (ingressive aorist of [pisteuO] in
   Jesus Christ. Many so-called great or grand sermons reap no such
   harvest. Dionysius the Areopagite [Dionusios ho Areopagites]. One of
   the judges of the Court of the Areopagus. That of itself was no small
   victory. He was one of this college of twelve judges who had helped to
   make Athens famous. Eusebius says that he became afterwards bishop of
   the Church at Athens and died a martyr. A woman named Damaris [gune
   onomati Damaris]. A woman by name Damaris. Not the wife of Dionysius as
   some have thought, but an aristocratic woman, not necessarily an
   educated courtezan as Furneaux holds. And there were "others" [heteroi]
   with them, a group strong enough to keep the fire burning in Athens. It
   is common to say that Paul in 1Co 2:1-5 alludes to his failure with
   philosophy in Athens when he failed to preach Christ crucified and he
   determined never to make that mistake again. On the other hand Paul
   determined to stick to the Cross of Christ in spite of the fact that
   the intellectual pride and superficial culture of Athens had prevented
   the largest success. As he faced Corinth with its veneer of culture and
   imitation of philosophy and sudden wealth he would go on with the same
   gospel of the Cross, the only gospel that Paul knew or preached. And it
   was a great thing to give the world a sermon like that preached in
   Athens.

Chapter 18

   18:1 To Corinth [eis Korinthon]. Mummius had captured and destroyed
   Corinth B.C. 146. It was restored by Julius Caesar B.C. 46 as a boom
   town and made a colony. It was now the capital of the province of
   Achaia and the chief commercial city of Greece with a cosmopolitan
   population. It was only fifty miles from Athens. The summit of
   Acrocorinthus was 1,800 feet high and the ports of Cenchreae and
   Lechaeum and the Isthmus across which ships were hauled gave it command
   of the trade routes between Asia and Rome. The temple of Aphrodite on
   the Acrocorinthus had a thousand consecrated prostitutes and the very
   name to Corinthianize meant immorality. Not the Parthenon with Athene
   faced Paul in Corinth, but a worse situation. Naturally many Jews were
   in such a mart of trade. Philippi, Thessalonica, Beroea, Athens, all
   had brought anxiety to Paul. What could he expect in licentious
   Corinth?

   18:2 Aquila [Akulan]. Luke calls him a Jew from Pontus, apparently not
   yet a disciple, though there were Jews from Pontus at the great
   Pentecost who were converted (2:9). Aquila who made the famous A.D.
   translation of the O.T. was also from Pontus. Paul "found" [heurOn],
   second aorist active participle of [heuriskO] though we do not know
   how. Edersheim says that a Jewish guild always kept together whether in
   street or synagogue so that by this bond they probably met. Lately come
   from Italy [prosphatOs eleluthota apo tes Italias]. Second perfect
   participle of [erchomai]. Koine adverb, here only in the N.T., from
   adjective [prosphatos] [pro, sphaO] or [sphazO], to kill), lately
   slaughtered and so fresh or recent (Heb 10:20). With his wife Priscilla
   [kai Priskillan gunaika autou]. Diminutive of [Priska] (Ro 16:3; 1Co
   16:19). Prisca is a name in the Acilian family and the Prisci was the
   name of another noble clan. Aquila may have been a freedman like many
   Jews in Rome. Her name comes before his in verses 18, 26; Ro 16:3; 2Ti
   4:9. Because Claudius had commanded [dia to diatetachenai Klaudion].
   Perfect active articular infinitive of [diatassO], old verb to dispose,
   arrange, here with accusative of general reference. [Dia] here is
   causal sense, "because of the having ordered as to Claudius." This was
   about A.D. 49, done, Suetonius says (Claudius C. 25), because "the Jews
   were in a state of constant tumult at the instigation of one Chrestus"
   (probably among the Jews about Christ so pronounced). At any rate Jews
   were unpopular in Rome for Tiberius had deported 4,000 to Sardinia.
   There were 20,000 Jews in Rome. Probably mainly those implicated in the
   riots actually left.

   18:3 Because he was of the same trade [dia to homotechnon einai]. Same
   construction with [dia] as above. [Homotechnon] is an old word [homos,
   techne], though here alone in N.T. Rabbi Judah says: "He that teacheth
   not his son a trade, doth the same as if he taught him to be a thief."
   So it was easy for Paul to find a home with these "tentmakers by trade"
   [skenoipoioi tei technei]. Late word from [skene] and [poieO], here
   only in the N.T. They made portable tents of leather or of cloth of
   goat's hair. So Paul lived in this home with this noble man and his
   wife, all the more congenial if already Christians which they soon
   became at any rate. They worked as partners in the common trade. Paul
   worked for his support elsewhere, already in Thessalonica (1Th 2:9; 2Th
   3:8) and later at Ephesus with Aquila and Priscilla (Ac 18:18, 26;
   20:34; 1Co 16:19). They moved again to Rome (Ro 16:3) and were
   evidently a couple of considerable wealth and generosity. It was a
   blessing to Paul to find himself with these people. So he "abode"
   [emenen], imperfect active) with them and "they wrought" [ergazonto],
   imperfect middle), happy and busy during week days.

   18:4 He reasoned [dielegeto]. Imperfect middle, same form as in 17:17
   about Paul's work in Athens, here only on the Sabbaths. Persuaded
   [epeithen]. Imperfect active, conative, he tried to persuade both Jews
   and Greeks (God-fearers who alone would come).

   18:5 Was constrained by the word [suneicheto tOi logOi]. This is
   undoubtedly the correct text and not [tOi pneumati] of the Textus
   Receptus, but [suneicheto] is in my opinion the direct middle imperfect
   indicative, not the imperfect passive as the translations have it
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 808). Paul held himself together or completely
   to the preaching instead of just on Sabbaths in the synagogue (verse
   4). The coming of Silas and Timothy with the gifts from Macedonia (1Th
   3:6; 2Co 11:9; Php 4:15) set Paul free from tent-making for a while so
   that he began to devote himself (inchoative imperfect) with fresh
   consecration to preaching. See the active in 2Co 5:14. He was now also
   assisted by Silas and Timothy (2Co 1:19). Testifying to the Jews that
   Jesus was the Christ [diamarturomenos tois Ioudaiois einai ton Christon
   Iesoun]. Paul's witness everywhere (9:22; 17:3). This verb
   [diamarturomenos] occurs in 2:40 (which see) for Peter's earnest
   witness. Perhaps daily now in the synagogue he spoke to the Jews who
   came. [Einai] is the infinitive in indirect discourse (assertion) with
   the accusative of general reference. By [ton Christon] Paul means "the
   Messiah." His witness is to show to the Jews that Jesus of Nazareth is
   the Messiah.

   18:6 When they opposed themselves [antitassomenOn autOn]. Genitive
   absolute with present middle (direct middle again) of [antitassO], old
   verb to range in battle array [tassO] face to face with or against
   [anti]. In the N.T. only here and Ro 13:2; Jas 4:6; 1Pe 5:5. Paul's
   fresh activity roused the rabbis as at Antioch in Pisidia and at
   Thessalonica in concerted opposition and railing (blasphemy). He shook
   out his raiment [ektinaxamenos ta himatia]. First aorist middle of
   [ektinassO], old verb, in the N.T. only here as in 13:51 (middle) and
   Mr 6:11; Mt 10:15 where active voice occurs of shaking out dust also.
   Vivid and dramatic picture here like that in Ne 5:13, "undoubtedly a
   very exasperating gesture" (Ramsay), but Paul was deeply stirred. Your
   blood be upon your own heads [To haima humOn epi ten kephalen humOn].
   As in Eze 3:18f., 33:4, 8f.; 2Sa 1:16. Not as a curse, but "a solemn
   disclaimer of responsibility" by Paul (Page) as in Ac 20:26. The Jews
   used this very phrase in assuming responsibility for the blood of Jesus
   (Mt 27:25). Cf. Mt 23:35. I am clean [katharos egO]. Pure from your
   blood. Repeats the claim made in previous sentence. Paul had done his
   duty. From henceforth [apo tou nun]. Turning point reached in Corinth.
   He will devote himself to the Gentiles, though Jews will be converted
   there also. Elsewhere as in Ephesus (19:1-10) and in Rome (Ac 28:23-28)
   Paul will preach also to Jews.

   18:7 Titus Justus [Titou Ioustou]. So Aleph E Vulgate, while B has
   [Titiau Ioustou], while most MSS. have only [Ioustou]. Evidently a
   Roman citizen and not Titus, brother of Luke, of Ga 2:1. We had
   Barsabbas Justus (Ac 1:23) and Paul speaks of Jesus Justus (Co 4:11).
   The Titii were a famous family of potters in Corinth. This Roman was a
   God-fearer whose house "joined hard to the synagogue" [en sunomorousa
   tei sunagOgei]. Periphrastic imperfect active of [sunomoreO], a late
   (Byzantine) word, here only in the N.T., followed by the associative
   instrumental case, from [sunomoros] [sun], [homoros] from [homos],
   joint, and [horos], boundary) having joint boundaries, right next to.
   Whether Paul chose this location for his work because it was next to
   the synagogue, we do not know, but it caught the attendants at the
   synagogue worship. In Ephesus when Paul had to leave the synagogue he
   went to the school house of Tyrannus (19:9f.). The lines are being
   drawn between the Christians and the Jews, drawn by the Jews
   themselves.

   18:8 Crispus [Krispos]. Though a Jew and ruler of the synagogue (cf.
   13:15), he had a Latin name. Paul baptized him (1Co 1:14) himself,
   perhaps because of his prominence, apparently letting Silas and Timothy
   baptize most of the converts (1Co 1:14-17). Probably he followed Paul
   to the house of Titus Justus. It looked like ruin for the synagogue.
   With all his house [sun holOi tOi oikOi autou]. Another household
   conversion, for Crispus "believed [episteusen] in the Lord with all his
   house." Hearing believed and were baptized [akouontes episteuon kai
   ebaptizonto]. Present active participle and imperfect indicatives
   active and passive, expressing repetition for the "many" others who
   kept coming to the Lord in Corinth. It was a continual revival after
   Silas and Timothy came and a great church was gathered here during the
   nearly two years that Paul laboured in Corinth (possibly A.D. 51 and
   52).

   18:9 Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace [Me phobou, alla
   lalei kai me siOpeseis]. Literally, "stop being afraid [me] with
   present middle imperative of [phobeO], but go on speaking (present
   active imperative of [laleO] and do not become silent [me] and first
   aorist active of [siOpaO], ingressive aorist)." Evidently there were
   signs of a gathering storm before this vision and message from the Lord
   Jesus came to Paul one night. Paul knew only too well what Jewish
   hatred could do as he had learned it at Damascus, Jerusalem, Antioch in
   Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, Thessalonica, Beroea. He had clearly
   moments of doubt whether he had not better move on or become silent for
   a while in Corinth. Every pastor knows what it is to have such moods
   and moments. In 2Th 3:2 (written at this time) we catch Paul's
   dejection of spirits. He was like Elijah (1Ki 19:4) and Jeremiah (Jer
   15:15ff.).

   18:10 Because I am with thee [dioti egO eimi meta sou]. Jesus had given
   this promise to all believers (Mt 28:20) and here he renews it to Paul.
   This promise changes Paul's whole outlook. Jesus had spoken to Paul
   before, on the way to Damascus (9:4), in Jerusalem (22:17f.), in Troas
   (16:9), in great crises of his life. He will hear him again (23:11;
   27:23). Paul knows the voice of Jesus. No man shall set on thee to harm
   thee [oudeis epithesetai soi tou kakOsai se]. Future direct middle
   indicative of [epitithemi], old and common verb, here in direct middle
   to lay or throw oneself upon, to attack. Jesus kept that promise in
   Corinth for Paul. [Tou kakOsai] is genitive articular infinitive of
   purpose of [kakoO], to do harm to. Paul would now face all the rabbis
   without fear. I have much people [laos estin moi polus]. Dative of
   personal interest. "There is to me much people," not yet saved, but who
   will be if Paul holds on. There is the problem for every preacher and
   pastor, how to win the elect to Christ.

   18:11 A year and six months [eniauton kai menas hex]. Accusative of
   extent of time. How much time before this incident he had been there we
   do not know. He was in Corinth probably a couple of years in all. His
   work extended beyond the city (2Co 11:10) and there was a church in
   Cenchreae (Ro 16:1).

   18:12 When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia [GalliOnos de anthupatou
   ontos tes Achaias]. Genitive absolute of present participle [ontos].
   Brother of Seneca the Stoic (Nero's tutor) and uncle of Lucan the
   author of the [Pharsalia]. His original name was M. Annaeus Novatus
   till he was adopted by Gallio the rhetorician. The family was Spanish.
   Gallio was a man of culture and refinement and may have been chosen
   proconsul of Achaia for this reason. Statius calls him "dulcis Gallio."
   Seneca says of him: Nemo enim mortalium uni tam dulcis quam hic omnibus
   (No one of mortals is so pleasant to one person as he is to all). Luke
   alone among writers says that he was proconsul, but Seneca speaks of
   his being in Achaia where he caught fever, a corroboration of Luke. But
   now a whitish grey limestone inscription from the Hagios Elias quarries
   near Delphi (a letter of Claudius to Delphi) has been found which
   definitely names Gallio as proconsul of Achaia [authupatos tes
   Achaias]. The province of Achaia after various shifts (first
   senatorial, then imperial) back and forth with Macedonia, in A.D. 44
   Claudius gave back to the Senate with proconsul as the title of the
   governor. It is amazing how Luke is confirmed whenever a new discovery
   is made. The discovery of this inscription has thrown light also on the
   date of Paul's work in Corinth as it says that Gallio came in the 26th
   acclamation of Claudius as Emperor in A.D. 51, that would definitely
   fix the time of Paul in Corinth as A.D. 50 and 51 (or 51 and 52).
   Deissmann has a full and able discussion of the whole matter in
   Appendix I to his St. Paul. Rose up [katepestesan]. Second aorist
   active of [kat-eph-istemi], intransitive, to take a stand against, a
   double compound verb found nowhere else. They took a stand [estesan]
   against [kata], down on, [epi], upon), they made a dash or rush at Paul
   as if they would stand it no longer. Before the judgment seat [epi to
   bema]. See on 12:21. The proconsul was sitting in the basilica in the
   forum or agora. The Jews had probably heard of his reputation for
   moderation and sought to make an impression as they had on the praetors
   of Philippi by their rush [sunepeste], 16:22). The new proconsul was a
   good chance also (25:2). So for the second time Paul faces a Roman
   proconsul (Sergius Paulus, 13:7) though under very different
   circumstances.

   18:13 Contrary to the law [para ton nomon]. They did not accuse Paul of
   treason as in Thessalonica, perhaps Paul had been more careful in his
   language here. They bring the same charge here that the owners of the
   slave-girl brought in Philippi (16:21) Perhaps they fear to go too far
   with Gallio, for they are dealing with a Roman proconsul, not with the
   politarchs of Thessalonica. The Jewish religion was a religio licita
   and they were allowed to make proselytes, but not among Roman citizens.
   To prove that Paul was acting contrary to Roman law (for Jewish law had
   no standing with Gallio though the phrase has a double meaning) these
   Jews had to show that Paul was making converts in ways that violated
   the Roman regulations on that subject. The accusation as made did not
   show it nor did they produce any evidence to do it. The verb used
   [anapeithei] means to stir up by persuasion (old verb here only in the
   N.T.), a thing that he had a right to do.

   18:14 When Paul was about to open his mouth [mellontos tou Paulou
   anoigein to stoma]. Genitive absolute again. Before Paul could speak,
   Gallio cut in and ended the whole matter. According to their own
   statement Paul needed no defence. Wrong [adikema]. Injuria. Old word, a
   wrong done one. In N.T. only here, Ac 24:20; Re 18:5. Here it may mean
   a legal wrong to the state. Wicked villainy [rhaidiourgema]. A crime,
   act of a criminal, from [rhaidiourgos] [rhaidios], easy, [ergon],
   work), one who does a thing with ease, adroitly, a "slick citizen."
   Reason would that I should bear with you [kata logon an aneschomen
   humOn]. Literally, "according to reason I should have put up with you
   (or held myself back from you)." This condition is the second class
   (determined as unfulfilled) and means that the Jews had no case against
   Paul in a Roman court. The verb in the conclusion [aneschomen] is
   second aorist middle indicative and means with the ablative [humOn] "I
   should have held myself back (direct middle) from you (ablative). The
   use of [an] makes the form of the condition plain.

   18:15 Questions [zetemata]. Plural, contemptuous, "a parcel of
   questions" (Knowling). About words [peri logou]. Word, singular, talk,
   not deed or fact [ergon, factum]. And names [kai onomatOn]. As to
   whether "Jesus" should also be called "Christ" or "Messiah." The Jews,
   Gallio knew, split hairs over words and names. And your own law [kai
   nomou tou kath' humas] Literally, "And law that according to you."
   Gallio had not been caught in the trap set for him. What they had said
   concerned Jewish law, not Roman law at all. Look to it yourselves
   [opsesthe autoi]. The volitive future middle indicative of [horaO]
   often used (cf. Mt 27:4) where an imperative could be employed
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 874). The use of [autoi] (yourselves) turns it
   all over to them. I am not minded [ou boulomai]. I am not willing, I do
   not wish. An absolute refusal to allow a religious question to be
   brought before a Roman civil court. This decision of Gallio does not
   establish Christianity in preference to Judaism. It simply means that
   the case was plainly that Christianity was a form of Judaism and as
   such was not opposed to Roman law. This decision opened the door for
   Paul's preaching all over the Roman Empire. Later Paul himself argues
   (Ro 9-11) that in fact Christianity is the true, the spiritual Judaism.

   18:16 He drave them [apelasen autous]. First aorist active indicative
   of [apelaunO], old word, but here alone in the N.T. The Jews were
   stunned by this sudden blow from the mild proconsul and wanted to
   linger to argue the case further, but they had to go.

   18:17 They all laid hold on Sosthenes [epilabomenoi pantes SOsthenen].
   See 16:19; 17:19 for the same form. Here is violent hostile reaction
   against their leader who had failed so miserably. Beat him [etupton].
   Inchoative imperfect active, began to beat him, even if they could not
   beat Paul. Sosthenes succeeded Crispus (verse 8) when he went over to
   Paul. The beating did Sosthenes good for he too finally is a Christian
   (1Co 1:1), a co-worker with Paul whom he had sought to persecute. And
   Gallio cared for none of these things [kai ouden toutOn tOi GalliOni
   emelen]. Literally, "no one of these things was a care to Gallio." The
   usually impersonal verb [melei, emelen], imperfect active) here has the
   nominative as in Lu 10:40. These words have been often misunderstood as
   a description of Gallio's lack of interest in Christianity, a religious
   indifferentist. But that is quite beside the mark. Gallio looked the
   other way with a blind eye while Sosthenes got the beating which he
   richly deserved. That was a small detail for the police court, not for
   the proconsul's concern. Gallio shows up well in Luke's narrative as a
   clear headed judge who would not be led astray by Jewish subterfuges
   and with the courage to dismiss a mob.

   18:18 Having tarried after this yet many days [eti prosmeinas hemeras
   hikanas]. First aorist (constative) active participle of [prosmenO],
   old verb, to remain besides [pros] as in 1Ti 1:3) and that idea is
   expressed also in [eti] (yet). The accusative is extent of time. On
   Luke's frequent use of [hikanos] see 8:11. It is not certain that this
   period of "considerable days" which followed the trial before Gallio is
   included in the year and six months of verse 11 or is in addition to it
   which is most likely. Vindicated as Paul was, there was no reason for
   haste in leaving, though he usually left after such a crisis was
   passed. Took his leave [apotaxamenos]. First aorist middle (direct),
   old verb, to separate oneself, to bid farewell (Vulgate valefacio), as
   in verse 21; Mr 6:46. Sailed thence [exeplei]. Imperfect active of
   [ekpleO], old and common verb, inchoative imperfect, started to sail.
   Only Priscilla and Aquila are mentioned as his companions though others
   may have been in the party. Having shorn his head [keiramenos ten
   kephalen]. First aorist middle (causative) of [keirO], old verb to
   shear (sheep) and the hair as also in 1Co 11:6. The participle is
   masculine and so cannot refer to Priscilla. Aquila comes next to the
   participle, but since mention of Priscilla and Aquila is parenthetical
   and the two other participles [prosmeinas, apotaxamenos] refer to Paul
   it seems clear that this one does also. For he had a vow [eichen gar
   euchen]. Imperfect active showing the continuance of the vow up till
   this time in Cenchreae, the port of Corinth when it expired. It was not
   a Nazarite vow which could be absolved only in Jerusalem. It is
   possible that the hair was only polled or trimmed, cut shorter, not
   "shaved" [xuraO] as in 21:24) for there is a distinction as both verbs
   are contrasted in 1Co 11:6 [keirasthai e xurasthai]. It is not clear
   what sort of a vow Paul had taken nor why he took it. It may have been
   a thank offering for the outcome at Corinth (Hackett). Paul as a Jew
   kept up his observance of the ceremonial law, but refused to impose it
   on the Gentiles.

   18:19 Came [katentesan]. Came down, as usual in speaking of coming to
   land (16:1). To Ephesus [eis Epheson]. This great city on the Cayster,
   the capital of the Province of Asia, the home of the worship of Diana
   (Artemis) with a wonderful temple, Paul at last had reached, though
   forbidden to come on the way out on this tour (16:6). Here Paul will
   spend three years after his return from Jerusalem. He left them there
   [kakeinous katelipen autou]. That is, Priscilla and Aquila he left
   (second aorist active indicative) here [autou]. But Luke mentions the
   departure by way of anticipation before he actually went away (verse
   21). But he himself [autos de]. Paul again the leading person in the
   narrative. On this occasion he may have gone alone into the synagogue.
   He reasoned [dielexato]. Luke's favourite word for Paul's synagogue
   discourses (17:2, 17; 18:4 which see) as also 19:8, 9.

   18:20 When they asked him [erOtOntOn autOn]. Genitive absolute of
   present participle of [erOtaO], old verb to ask a question, common in
   Koine to make a request as here. He consented not [ouk epeneusen].
   First aorist active indicative of [epineuO], old verb to express
   approval by a nod, only here in the N.T.

   18:21 I shall return [anakampsO]. Future active indicative of
   [anakamptO], old verb to bend back, turn back (Mt 2:2). If God will
   [tou theou thelontos]. Genitive absolute of present active participle.
   This expression [ean] with subjunctive) occurs also in 1Co 4:19; 16:7;
   Jas 4:15. Such phrases were common among Jews, Greeks, and Romans, and
   are today. It is simply a recognition that we are in God's hands. The
   Textus Receptus has here a sentence not in the best MSS.: "I must by
   all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem." This addition by D
   and other documents may have been due to a desire to give a reason for
   the language in verse 22 about "going up" to Jerusalem. Whether Paul
   said it or not, it was in the spring when he made this journey with a
   company of pilgrims probably going to the feast of Pentecost in
   Jerusalem. We know that later Paul did try to reach Jerusalem for
   Pentecost (20:16) and succeeded. As the ship was leaving, Paul had to
   go, but with the hope of returning soon to Ephesus as he did.

   18:22 He went up and saluted the church [anabas kai aspasamenos ten
   ekklesian]. The language could refer to the church in Caesarea where
   Paul had just landed, except for several things. The going up [anabas],
   second aorist active participle of [anabainO] is the common way of
   speaking of going to Jerusalem which was up from every direction save
   from Hebron. It was the capital of Palestine as people in England today
   speaking of going up to London. Besides "he went down to Antioch"
   [katebe eis Antiocheian], second aorist active indicative of
   [katabainO] which language suits better leaving Jerusalem than
   Caesarea. Moreover, there was no special reason for this trip to
   Caesarea, but to Jerusalem it was different. Here Paul saluted the
   church in the fourth of his five visits after his conversion (9:26;
   11:30; 15:4; 18:22; 21:17). The apostles may or may not have been in
   the city, but Paul had friends in Jerusalem now. Apparently he did not
   tarry long, but returned to Antioch to make a report of his second
   mission tour as he had done at the close of the first when he and
   Barnabas came back (14:26-28). He had started on this tour with Silas
   and had picked up Timothy and Luke, but came back alone. He had a great
   story to tell.

   18:23 Having spent some time [poiesas chronon tina]. Literally, having
   done some time. How long we do not know, probably not long. There are
   those who place the visit of Peter here to which Paul alludes in Ga
   2:11ff. and which we have located while Paul was here the last time (Ac
   15:35). He departed [exelthen]. Thus simply and alone Paul began the
   third mission tour without a Barnabas or a Silas. Went through
   [dierchomenos]. Present middle participle, going through. The region of
   Galatia and Phrygia [ten Galatiken chOran kai Phrygian]. See on Ac 16:6
   for discussion of this phrase, here in reverse order, passing through
   the Galatic region and then Phrygia. Does Luke mean Lycaonia (Derbe and
   Lystra) and Phrygia (Iconium and Pisidian Antioch)? Or does he mean the
   route west through the old Galatia and the old Phrygia on west into
   Asia? The same conflict exists here over the South Galatian and the
   North Galatian theories. Phrygia is apparently distinguished from the
   Galatic region here. It is apparently A.D. 52 when Paul set out on this
   tour. In order [kathexes]. In succession as in 11:4, though the names
   of the cities are not given. Stablishing [sterizOn]. As he did in the
   second tour (15:41, [episterizOn], compound of this same verb) which
   see.

   18:24 Apollos [ApollOs]. Genitive [-O] Attic second declension.
   Probably a contraction of [Apollonios] as D has it here. An Alexandrian
   [Alexandreus]. Alexander the Great founded this city B.C. 332 and
   placed a colony of Jews there which flourished greatly, one-third of
   the population at this time. There was a great university and library
   there. The Jewish-Alexandrian philosophy developed here of which Philo
   was the chief exponent who was still living. Apollos was undoubtedly a
   man of the schools and a man of parts. A learned man [aner logios]. Or
   eloquent, as the word can mean either a man of words (like one "wordy,"
   verbose) or a man of ideas, since [logos] was used either for reason or
   speech. Apollos was doubtless both learned (mighty in the Scriptures)
   and eloquent, though eloquence varies greatly in people's ideas. Mighty
   in the Scriptures [dunatos On en tais graphais]. Being powerful
   [dunatos] verbal of [dunamai] and same root as [dunamis], dynamite,
   dynamo) in the Scriptures (in the knowledge and the use of the
   Scriptures), as should be true of every preacher. There is no excuse
   for ignorance of the Scriptures on the part of preachers, the professed
   interpreters of the word of God. The last lecture made to the New
   Testament English class in Southern Baptist Theological Seminary by
   John A. Broadus was on this passage with a plea for his students to be
   mighty in the Scriptures. In Alexandria Clement of Alexandria and
   Origen taught in the Christian theological school.

   18:25 Had been instructed in the way of the Lord [en katechemenos ten
   hodon tou kuriou]. Periphrastic past perfect passive of [katecheO],
   rare in the old Greek and not in the LXX from [kata] and [echeO]
   [echO], sound) as in Lu 1:4, to re-sound, to re-echo, to teach by
   repeated dinning into the ears as the Arabs do now, to teach orally by
   word of mouth (and ear). Here the accusative of the thing (the word) is
   retained in the passive like with [didaskO], to teach (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 485). Being fervent in spirit [zeOn tOi pneumati]. Boiling
   (from [zeO], to boil, old and common verb, in N.T. only here and Ro
   12:11) like boiling water or yeast. The Latin verb ferveo means to boil
   or ferment. Locative case after it. Taught carefully [edidasken
   akribOs]. Imperfect active, was teaching or inchoative, began teaching,
   accurately. He taught accurately what he knew, a fine gift for any
   preacher. Only the baptism of John [monon to baptisma IOanou]. It was a
   baptism of repentance (marked by repentance) as Paul said (13:24;
   19:4), as Peter said (2:38) and as the Gospels tell (Mr 1:4, etc.).
   That is to say, Apollos knew only what the Baptist knew when he died,
   but John had preached the coming of the Messiah, had baptized him, had
   identified him as the Son of God, had proclaimed the baptism of the
   Holy Spirit, but had not seen the Cross, the Resurrection of Jesus, nor
   the great Day of Pentecost.

   18:26 They took him unto them [proselabonto]. Second aorist middle
   (indirect) indicative of [proslambanO], old verb, to their home and
   heart as companion (cf. the rabbis and the ruffians in 17:5). Probably
   for dinner after service. Expounded [exethento]. Second aorist
   (effective) middle indicative of [ektithemi] seen already in 11:4, to
   set forth. More carefully [akribesteron]. Comparative adverb of
   [akribOs]. More accurately than he already knew. Instead of abusing the
   young and brilliant preacher for his ignorance they (particularly
   Priscilla) gave him the fuller story of the life and work of Jesus and
   of the apostolic period to fill up the gaps in his knowledge. It is a
   needed and delicate task, this thing of teaching gifted young
   ministers. They do not learn it all in schools. More of it comes from
   contact with men and women rich in grace and in the knowledge of God's
   ways. He was not rebaptized, but only received fuller information.

   18:27 Encouraged him [protrepsamenoi]. First aorist middle participle
   of [protrepO], old verb, to urge forward, to push on, only here in the
   N.T. Since Apollos wanted [boulomenou autou], genitive absolute) to go
   into Achaia, the brethren (including others besides Priscilla and
   Aquila) wrote [egrapsan] a letter of introduction to the disciples in
   Corinth to receive him [apodexasthai auton], a nice letter of
   recommendation and a sincere one also. But Paul will refer to this very
   letter later (2Co 3:1) and observe that he himself needed no such
   letter of commendation. The Codex Bezae adds here that certain
   Corinthians who had come to Ephesus heard Apollos and begged him to
   cross over with them to Corinth. This may very well be the way that
   Apollos was led to go. Preachers often receive calls because visitors
   from other places hear them. Priscilla and Aquila were well known in
   Corinth and their approval would carry weight. But they did not urge
   Apollos to stay longer in Ephesus. Helped them much [sunebaleto polu].
   Second aorist middle indicative of [sunballO] used in 17:18 for
   "dispute," old verb to throw together, in the N.T. always in the active
   save here in the middle (common in Greek writers) to put together, to
   help. Through grace [dia tes charitos]. This makes sense if taken with
   "believed," as Hackett does (cf. 13:48; 16:14) or with "helped" (1Co
   3:10; 15:10; 2Co 1:12). Both are true as the references show.

   18:28 Powerfully [eutonOs]. Adverb from [eutonos] [eu], well, [teinO],
   to stretch), well-strung, at full stretch. Confuted [diakatelegcheto].
   Imperfect middle of the double compound verb [dia-kat-elegchomai], to
   confute with rivalry in a contest, here alone. The old Greek has
   [dielegchO], to convict of falsehood, but not this double compound
   which means to argue down to a finish. It is the imperfect tense and
   does not mean that Apollos convinced these rabbis, but he had the last
   word. Publicly [demosiai]. See 5:18; 16:37. In open meeting where all
   could see the victory of Apollos. Shewing [epideiknus]. Present active
   participle of [epideiknumi], old verb to set forth so that all see. By
   the Scriptures [dia tOn graphOn]. In which Apollos was so "mighty"
   (verse 24) and the rabbis so weak for they knew the oral law better
   than the written (Mr 7:8-12). That Jesus was the Christ [einai ton
   Christon Iesoun]. Infinitive and the accusative in indirect assertion.
   Apollos proclaims the same message that Paul did everywhere (17:3). He
   had not yet met Paul, but he had been instructed by Priscilla and
   Aquila. He is in Corinth building on the foundation laid so well by
   Paul (1Co 3:4-17). Luke has here made a brief digression from the story
   of Paul, but it helps us understand Paul better There are those who
   think that Apollos wrote Hebrews, a guess that may be correct.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 19

   19:1 While Apollos was at Corinth [en tOi ton ApollO einai en
   KorinthOi]. Favourite idiom with Luke, [en] with the locative of the
   articular infinitive and the accusative of general reference (Lu 1:8;
   2:27, etc.). Having passed through the upper country [dielthonta ta
   anOterika mere]. Second aorist active participle of [dierchomai],
   accusative case agreeing with [Paulon], accusative of general reference
   with the infinitive [elthein], idiomatic construction with [egeneto].
   The word for "upper" [anOterika] is a late form for [anOtera] (Lu
   14:10) and occurs in Hippocrates and Galen. It refers to the highlands
   (cf. Xenophon's Anabasis) and means that Paul did not travel the usual
   Roman road west by Colossae and Laodicea in the Lycus Valley, cities
   that he did not visit (Col 2:1). Instead he took the more direct road
   through the Cayster Valley to Ephesus. Codex Bezae says here that Paul
   wanted to go back to Jerusalem, but that the Holy Spirit bade him to go
   into Asia where he had been forbidden to go in the second tour (16:6).
   Whether the upper "parts" [mere] here points to North Galatia is still
   a point of dispute among scholars. So he came again to Ephesus as he
   had promised to do (18:21). The province of Asia included the western
   part of Asia Minor. The Romans took this country B.C. 130. Finally the
   name was extended to the whole continent. It was a jewel in the Roman
   empire along with Africa and was a senatorial province. It was full of
   great cities like Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis,
   Philadelphia, Laodicea (the seven churches of Re 2; 3), Colossae,
   Hierapolis, Apamea, to go no further. Hellenism had full sway here.
   Ephesus was the capital and chief city and was a richer and larger city
   than Corinth. It was located at the entrance to the valley of the
   Maeander to the east. Here was the power of Rome and the splendour of
   Greek culture and the full tide of oriental superstition and magic. The
   Temple of Artemis was one of the seven wonders of the world. While in
   Ephesus some hold that Paul at this time wrote the Epistle to the
   Galatians after his recent visit there, some that he did it before his
   recent visit to Jerusalem. But it is still possible that he wrote it
   from Corinth just before writing to Rome, a point to discuss later.
   Certain disciples [tinas mathetas]. Who were they? Apollos had already
   gone to Corinth. They show no connection with Priscilla and Aquila.
   Luke calls them "disciples" or "learners" [mathetas] because they were
   evidently sincere though crude and ignorant. There is no reason at all
   for connecting these uninformed disciples of the Baptist with Apollos.
   They were floating followers of the Baptist who drifted into Ephesus
   and whom Paul found. Some of John's disciples clung to him till his
   death (Joh 3:22-25; Lu 7:19; Mt 14:12). Some of them left Palestine
   without the further knowledge of Jesus that came after his death and
   some did not even know that, as turned out to be the case with the
   group in Ephesus.

   19:2 Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? [ei pneuma hagion
   elabete pisteusantes?]. This use of [Pi] in a direct question occurs in
   1:6, is not according to the old Greek idiom, but is common in the LXX
   and the N.T. as in Lu 13:23 which see (Robertson, Grammar, p. 916).
   Apparently Paul was suspicious of the looks or conduct of these
   professed disciples. The first aorist active participle [pisteusantes]
   is simultaneous with the second aorist active indicative [elabete] and
   refers to the same event. Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the
   Holy Spirit was [All' oude ei pneuma hagion estin ekousamen]. The reply
   of these ignorant disciples is amazing. They probably refer to the time
   of their baptism and mean that, when baptized, they did not hear
   whether [ei] in indirect question) the Holy Spirit was [estin] retained
   as in Joh 7:39). Plain proof that they knew John's message poorly.

   19:3 Into what [eis ti]. More properly, Unto what or on what basis
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 592). Clearly, Paul felt they had received a
   poor baptism with no knowledge of the Holy Spirit. John's baptism [to
   IOanou baptisma]. Last mention of John the Baptist in the N.T. They had
   been dipped in other words, but they had not grasped the significance
   of the ordinance.

   19:4 With the baptism of repentance [baptisma metanoias]. Cognate
   accusative with [ebaptisen] and the genitive [metanoias] describing the
   baptism as marked by (case of species or genus), not as conveying,
   repentance just as in Mr 1:4 and that was the work of the Holy Spirit.
   But John preached also the baptism of the Holy Spirit which the Messiah
   was to bring (Mr 1:7f.; Mt 3:11f.; Lu 3:16). If they did not know of
   the Holy Spirit, they had missed the point of John's baptism. That they
   should believe on him that should come after him, that is on Jesus [eis
   ton erchomenon met' auton hina pisteusOsin, tout' estin eis ton
   Iesoun]. Note the emphatic prolepsis of [eis ton erchomenon met' auton]
   before [hina pisteusOsin] with which it is construed. This is John's
   identical phrase, "the one coming after me" as seen in Mr 1:7; Mt 3:11;
   Lu 3:16; Joh 1:15. It is not clear that these "disciples" believed in a
   Messiah, least of all in Jesus. They were wholly unprepared for the
   baptism of John. Paul does not mean to say that John's baptism was
   inadequate, but he simply explains what John really taught and so what
   his baptism signified.

   19:5 The name of the Lord Jesus [to onoma ton kuriou Iesou]. Apollos
   was not rebaptized. The twelve apostles were not rebaptized. Jesus
   received no other baptism than that of John. The point here is simply
   that these twelve men were grossly ignorant of the meaning of John's
   baptism as regards repentance, the Messiahship of Jesus, the Holy
   Spirit. Hence Paul had them baptized, not so much again, as really
   baptized this time, in the name or on the authority of the Lord Jesus
   as he had himself commanded (Mt 28:19) and as was the universal
   apostolic custom. Proper understanding of "Jesus" involved all the rest
   including the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Luke does not
   give a formula, but simply explains that now these men had a proper
   object of faith (Jesus) and were now really baptized.

   19:6 When Paul had laid his hands upon them [epithentos autois tou
   Paulou cheiras]. Genitive absolute of second aorist active participle
   of [epitithemi]. This act of laying on of the hands was done in Samaria
   by Peter and John (8:16) and in Damascus in the case of Paul (9:17) and
   was followed as here by the descent of the Holy Spirit in supernatural
   power. They spake with tongues [elaloun glOssais]. Inchoative
   imperfect, began to speak with tongues as in Jerusalem at Pentecost and
   as in Caesarea before the baptism. Prophesied [epropheteuon].
   Inchoative imperfect again, began to prophesy. The speaking with
   tongues and prophesying was external and indubitable proof that the
   Holy Spirit had come on these twelve uninformed disciples now fully won
   to the service of Jesus as Messiah. But this baptism in water did not
   "convey" the Holy Spirit nor forgiveness of sins. Paul was not a
   sacramentalist.

   19:8 Spake boldly [eparresiazeto]. Imperfect middle, kept on at it for
   three months. Cf. same word in 18:26. Persuading [peithOn]. Present
   active conative participle of [peithO], trying to persuade (28:23).
   Paul's idea of the Kingdom of God was the church of God which he
   (Jesus, God's Son) had purchased with his own blood (Ac 20:28, calling
   Christ God). Nowhere else had Paul apparently been able to speak so
   long in the synagogue without interruption unless it was so at Corinth.
   These Jews were already interested (18:30).

   19:9 But when some were hardened [hOs de tines esklerunonto]. Imperfect
   passive of [sklerunO], causative like hiphil in Hebrew, to make hard
   [skleros] or rough or harsh (Mt 25:24). In LXX and Hippocrates and
   Galen (in medical writings). In N.T. only here and Ro 9:18 and 4 times
   in Heb 3:8, 13, 15; 4:7, 8 quoting and referring to Ps 95:8 about
   hardening the heart like a gristle. The inevitable reaction against
   Paul went on even in Ephesus though slowly. Disobedient [epeithoun].
   Imperfect again, showing the growing disbelief and disobedience
   [apeithes], both ideas as in 14:2; 17:5, first refusal to believe and
   then refusal to obey. Both [sklerunO] and [apeitheO] occur together, as
   here, in Ecclus. 30:12. Speaking evil of the Way [kakologountes ten
   hodon]. Late verb from [kakologos] (speaker of evil) for the old [kakOs
   legO]. Already in Mr 7:10; 9:39; Mt 15:4. Now these Jews are aggressive
   opponents of Paul and seek to injure his influence with the crowd. Note
   "the Way" as in 9:2 for Christianity. He departed from them [apostas
   ap' autOn]. Second aorist active participle of [aphistemi], made an
   "apostasy" (standing off, cleavage) as he did at Corinth (18:7,
   [metabas], making a change). Separated the disciples [aphOrisen tous
   mathetas]. First aorist active indicative of [aphorizO], old verb to
   mark limits (horizon) as already in 13:2. Paul himself was a spiritual
   Pharisee "separated" to Christ (Ro 1:1). The Jews regarded this
   withdrawal as apostasy, like separating the sheep from the goats (Mt
   25:32). Paul now made a separate church as he had done at Thessalonica
   and Corinth. In the school of Tyrannus [en tei scholei Turannou].
   [Schole] (our school) is an old word from [schein] [echO] to hold on,
   leisure and then in later Greek (Plutarch, etc.) a place where there is
   leisure as here. Only this example in the N.T. This is the Greek notion
   of "school," the Jewish being that of "yoke" as in Mt 11:29. The name
   Tyrannus (our tyrant) is a common one. It is an inscription in the
   Columbarium of the Empress Livia as that of a physician in the court.
   Furneaux suggests the possibility that a relative of this physician was
   lecturing on medicine in Ephesus and so as a friend of Luke, the
   physician, would be glad to help Paul about a place to preach. It was
   probably a public building or lecture hall with this name whether hired
   by Paul or loaned to him. The pagan sophists often spoke in such halls.
   The Codex Bezae adds "from the fifth hour to the tenth" as the time
   allotted Paul for his work in this hall, which is quite possible, from
   just before midday till the close of the afternoon (from before the
   noon meal till two hours before sunset) each day. Here Paul had great
   freedom and a great hearing. As the church grows there will be other
   places of meeting as the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla
   (1Co 16:19).

   19:10 For two years [epi ete duo]. Note [epi] with accusative for
   extent of time as in verse 8, [epi menas treis] and often. But in 20:31
   Paul said to the Ephesian elders at Miletus that he laboured with them
   for the space of "three years." That may be a general expression and
   there was probably a longer period after the "two years" in the school
   of Tyrannus besides the six months in the synagogue. Paul may have
   preached thereafter in the house of Aquila and Priscilla for some
   months, the "for a while" of verse 22. So that all they which dwelt in
   Asia heard [hOste pantas tous katoikountas ten Asian akousai]. Actual
   result with [hOste] and the infinitive with accusative of general
   reference as is common (also verse 11) in the Koine (Robertson,
   Grammar, pp. 999f.). Paul apparently remained in Ephesus, but the
   gospel spread all over the province even to the Lycus Valley including
   the rest of the seven churches of Re 1:11; 2; 3. Demetrius in verse 26
   will confirm the tremendous influence of Paul's ministry in Ephesus on
   Asia. Forty years after this Pliny in his famous letter to Trajan from
   Bithynia will say of Christianity: "For the contagion of this
   superstition has not only spread through cities, but also through
   villages and country places." It was during these years in Ephesus that
   Paul was greatly disturbed over the troubles in the Corinthian Church.
   He apparently wrote a letter to them now lost to us (1Co 5:9), received
   messages from the household of Chloe, a letter from the church, special
   messengers, sent Timothy, then Titus, may have made a hurried trip
   himself, wrote our First Corinthians, was planning to go after the
   return of Titus to Troas where he was to meet him after Pentecost, when
   all of a sudden the uproar raised by Demetrius hurried Paul away sooner
   than he had planned. Meanwhile Apollos had returned from Corinth to
   Ephesus and refused to go back (1Co 16:12). Paul doubtless had helpers
   like Epaphras and Philemon who carried the message over the province of
   Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus of Asia who were with him on the last
   visit to Jerusalem (verses 22, 29; 20:4). Paul's message reached
   Greeks, not merely Hellenists and God-fearers, but some of the Greeks
   in the upper circles of life in Ephesus.

   19:11 Special miracles [dunameis ou tas tuchousas]. "Powers not the
   ones that happen by chance," "not the ordinary ones," litotes for "the
   extraordinary." All "miracles" or "powers" [dunameis] are supernatural
   and out of the ordinary, but here God regularly wrought [epoiei],
   imperfect active) wonders beyond those familiar to the disciples and
   completely different from the deeds of the Jewish exorcists. This
   phrase is peculiar to Luke in the N.T. (also 28:2), but it occurs in
   the classical Greek and in the Koine as in III Macc. 3:7 and in papyri
   and inscriptions (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 255). In Samaria Philip
   wrought miracles to deliver the people from the influence of Simon
   Magus. Here in Ephesus exorcists and other magicians had built an
   enormous vogue of a false spiritualism and Paul faces unseen forces of
   evil. His tremendous success led some people to superstitious practices
   thinking that there was power in Paul's person.

   19:12 Handkerchiefs [soudaria]. Latin word for [sudor] (sweat). Used in
   Lu 19:20; Joh 11:44; 20:7. In two papyri marriage-contracts this word
   occurs among the toilet articles in the dowry (Deissmann, Bible
   Studies, p. 223). Aprons [simikinthia]. Latin word also, semicinctilum
   [semi, cingo]. Only here in the N.T. Linen aprons used by servants or
   artisans (Martial XIV. 153). Paul did manual work at Ephesus (20:34)
   and so wore these aprons. Departed [apallalsethai]. Present passive
   infinitive with [hOste] for actual result as in verse 10. If one
   wonders how God could honour such superstitious faith, he should
   remember that there is no power in superstition or in magic, but in
   God. If God never honoured any faith save that entirely free from
   superstition, how about Christian people who are troubled over the
   number 13, over the moon, the rabbit's foot? The poor woman with an
   issue of blood touched the hem of Christ's garment and was healed (Lu
   8:44-46) as others sought to do (Mt 14:36). God condescends to meet us
   in our ignorance and weakness where he can reach us. Elisha had a
   notion that some of the power of Elijah resided in his mantle (2Ki
   2:13). Some even sought help from Peter's shadow (Ac 5:15).

   19:13 Of the strolling Jews, exorcists [tOn perierchomenOn IoudaiOn
   exorkistOn]. These exorcists travelled around [peri] from place to
   place like modern Gypsy fortune-tellers. The Jews were especially
   addicted to such practices with spells of sorcery connected with the
   name of Solomon (Josephus, Ant. VIII. 2.5). See also Tobit 8:1-3. Jesus
   alludes to those in Palestine (Mt 12:27; Lu 11:19). The exorcists were
   originally those who administered an oath (from [exorkizO], to exact an
   oath), then to use an oath as a spell or charm. Only instance here in
   the N.T. These men regarded Paul as one of their own number just as
   Simon Magus treated Simon Peter. Only here these exorcists paid Paul
   the compliment of imitation instead of offering money as Magus did. To
   name over [onomazein epi]. They heard what Paul said and treated his
   words as a magic charm or spell to drive the evil spirits out. I adjure
   you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth [HorkizO humas ton Iesoun hon Paulos
   kerussei]. Note two accusatives with the verb of swearing (cf. Mr 5:7)
   as a causative verb (Robertson, Grammar, p. 483). The papyri furnish
   numerous instances of [horkizO] in such constructions (Deissmann, Bible
   Studies, p. 281). Note also the article with Jesus, "the Jesus," as if
   to identify the magic word to the demons with the addition "whom Paul
   preaches." They thought that success turned on the correct use of the
   magical formula. The Ephesian mysteries included Christianity, so they
   supposed.

   19:14 Seven sons of Sceva [Skeua hepta huioi]. Who this Sceva was we do
   not know. If a high priest, he was highly connected in Jerusalem (cf.
   5:24). Some MSS. have ruler instead of priest. His name may be Latin in
   origin. [Skeua] has Doric form of genitive. But that he had seven sons
   in this degraded business shows how Judaism had fared poorly in this
   superstitious city. Did they imagine there was special power in the
   number seven?

   19:15 Jesus I know [ton Iesoun ginOskO]. "The (whom you mention) Jesus
   I recognize [ginOskO]" and "the (whom you mentioned) Paul I am
   acquainted with [ton Paulon epistamai]." Clear distinction between
   [ginOskO] and [epistamai]. But who are ye? [humeis de tines este?]. But
   you, who are you? Emphatic prolepsis.

   19:16 Leaped on them [ephalomenos ep' autous]. Second aorist
   (ingressive) middle participle of [ephallomai], old verb to spring upon
   like a panther, here only in the N.T. Mastered [katakurieusas]. First
   aorist (effective) active participle of [katakurieuO], late verb from
   [kata] and [kurios], to become lord or master of. Both [amphoterOn].
   Papyri examples exist where [amphoteroi] means "all" or more than "two"
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 745). So here [amphoteroi] includes all seven.
   "Both" in old English was used for more than two. So that [hOste].
   Another example (verses 10, 11) of [hOste] with the infinitive for
   result. Naked [gumnous]. Probably with torn garments, Wounded
   [tetraumatismenous]. Perfect passive participle of [traumatizO], old
   verb to wound, from [trauma] (a wound). In the N.T. only here and Lu
   20:12.

   19:17 Was magnified [emegaluneto]. Imperfect passive. To make great. It
   was a notable victory over the powers of evil in Ephesus.

   19:18 Came [erchonto]. Imperfect middle, kept coming, one after
   another. Even some of the believers were secretly under the spell of
   these false spiritualists just as some Christians today cherish private
   contacts with so-called occult powers through mediums, seances, of
   which they are ashamed. Confessing [exomologoumenoi]. It was time to
   make a clean breast of it all, to turn on the light, to unbosom their
   secret habits. Declaring their deeds [anaggellontes tas praxeis autOn].
   Judgment was beginning at the house of God. The dupes (professing
   believers, alas) of these jugglers or exorcists now had their eyes
   opened when they saw the utter defeat of the tricksters who had tried
   to use the name of Jesus without his power. The boomerang was
   tremendous. The black arts were now laid bare in their real character.
   Gentile converts had a struggle to shake off their corrupt environment.

   19:19 Not a few of them that practised curious arts [hikanoi tOn ta
   perierga praxantOn]. Considerable number of the performers or exorcists
   themselves who knew that they were humbugs were led to renounce their
   evil practices. The word [perierga] (curious) is an old word [peri,
   erga] originally a piddler about trifles, a busybody (1Ti 5:13), then
   impertinent and magical things as here. Only two examples in the N.T.
   It is a technical term for magic as the papyri and inscriptions show.
   Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 323) thinks that these books here burned
   were just like the Magic Papyri now recovered from Egypt. Burned them
   in the sight of all [katekaion enOpion pantOn]. Imperfect active of
   [katakaiO]. It probably took a good while to do it, burned them
   completely (up, we say; down, the Greeks say, perfective use of [kata].
   These Magical Papyri or slips of parchment with symbols or magical
   sentences written on them called [Ephesia Grammata] (Ephesian Letters).
   These Ephesian Letters were worn as amulets or charms. They brought
   them together [sunenegkantes]. Second aorist active participle of
   [sunpherO]. What a glorious conflagration it would be if in every city
   all the salacious, blasphemous, degrading books, pamphlets, magazines,
   and papers could be piled together and burned. They counted
   [sunepsephisan]. First aorist active indicative of [sunpsephizO], to
   reckon together. In LXX (Jer 29:49). Only here in N.T.
   [SunkatapsephizO] in 1:26. Fifty thousand pieces of silver [arguriou
   muriadas pente]. Five ten thousand [muriadas] pieces of silver. Ephesus
   was largely Greek and probably the silver pieces were Greek drachmae or
   the Latin denarius, probably about ten thousand dollars or two thousand
   English pounds.

   19:20 Mightily [kata kratos]. According to strength. Only here in N.T.,
   common military term in Thucydides. Such proof of a change counted.
   Grew and prevailed [euxanen kai ischuen]. Imperfect actives, kept
   growing and gaining strength. It was a day of triumph for Christ in
   Ephesus, this city of vast wealth and superstition. Ephesus for
   centuries will be one of the centres of Christian power. Timothy will
   come here and John the Apostle and Polycarp and Irenaeus.

   19:21 Purposed in the spirit [etheto en tOi pneumati]. Second aorist
   middle indicative for mental action and "spirit" expressed also. A new
   stage in Paul's career begins here, a new division of the Acts. Passed
   through [dielthOn]. Word [dierchomai] used ten times in Acts (cf. 19:1)
   of missionary journeys (Ramsay). Macedonia and Achaia [ten Makedonian
   kai Achaian]. This was the way that he actually went, but originally he
   had planned to go to Achaia (Corinth) and then to Macedonia, as he says
   in 2Co 1:15f., but he had now changed that purpose, perhaps because of
   the bad news from Corinth. Already when he wrote I Corinthians he
   proposed to go first to Macedonia (1Co 16:5-7). He even hoped to spend
   the winter in Corinth "if the Lord permit" and to remain in Ephesus
   till Pentecost, neither of which things he did. I must also see Rome
   [dei me kai ROmen idein]. This section of Acts begins with Rome in the
   horizon of Paul's plans and the book closes with Paul in Rome
   (Rackham). Here he feels the necessity of going as in Ro 1:15 he feels
   himself "debtor" to all including "those in Rome" (Ro 1:16). Paul had
   long desired to go to Rome (Rom 1:10), but had been frequently hindered
   (Ro 1:13), but he has definitely set his face to go to Rome and on to
   Spain (Ro 15:23-29). Paley calls sharp attention to this parallel
   between Ac 19:21 and Ro 1:10-15; 15:23-29. Rome had a fascination for
   Paul as the home of Aquila and Priscilla and numerous other friends (Ro
   16), but chiefly as the capital of the Roman Empire and a necessary
   goal in Paul's ambition to win it to Jesus Christ. His great work in
   Asia had stirred afresh in him the desire to do his part for Rome. He
   wrote to Rome from Corinth not long after this and in Jerusalem Jesus
   in vision will confirm the necessity [dei] that Paul see Rome (Acts
   23:11).

   19:22 Timothy and Erastus [Timotheon kai Eraston]. Paul had sent
   Timothy to Corinth (1Co 4:17) and had requested kindly treatment of
   this young minister in his difficult task of placating the divided
   church (1Co 16:10-11) that he might return to Paul as he evidently had
   before Paul leaves Ephesus. He then despatched Titus to Corinth to
   finish what Timothy had not quite succeeded in doing with instructions
   to meet him in Troas. Now Timothy and Erastus (cf. Ro 16:23; 2Ti 4:20)
   go on to Macedonia to prepare the way for Paul who will come on later.
   He himself stayed in Asia for a while [autos epeschen chronon eis ten
   Asian]. Literally, He himself had additional time in Asia. Second
   aorist active indicative of [epechO], old and common idiom, only here
   in the N.T. in this sense and the verb only in Luke and Paul. The
   reason for Paul's delay is given by him in 1Co 16:8f., the great door
   wide open in Ephesus. Here again Luke and Paul supplement each other.
   Pentecost came towards the end of May and May was the month of the
   festival of Artemis (Diana) when great multitudes would come to
   Ephesus. But he did not remain till Pentecost as both Luke and Paul
   make plain.

   19:23 No small stir [tarachos ouk oligos]. Same phrase in 12:18 and
   nowhere else in the N.T. Litotes. Concerning the Way [peri tes hodou].
   See this phrase for Christianity in 9:2; 19:9; 24:22 which see, like
   the "Jesus Way" of the Indians. There had already been opposition and
   "stir" before this stage (cf. 19:11-20). The fight with wild beasts in
   1Co 15:32 (whatever it was) was before that Epistle was written and so
   before this new uproar. Paul as a Roman citizen could not be thrown to
   wild beasts, but he so pictured the violent opponents of Christ in
   Ephesus.

   19:24 Demetrius, a silversmith [Demetrios argurokopos]. The name is
   common enough and may or may not be the man mentioned in 3Jo 1:12 who
   was also from the neighbourhood of Ephesus. There is on an inscription
   at Ephesus near the close of the century a Demetrius called [neopoios
   Artemidos] a temple warden of Artemis (Diana). Zoeckler suggests that
   Luke misunderstood this word [neopoios] and translated it into
   [argurokopos], a beater [koptO], to beat) of silver [arguros], silver),
   "which made silver shrines of Artemis" [poiOn naous] (argurous)
   [Artemidos]. It is true that no silver shrines of the temple have been
   found in Ephesus, but only numerous terra-cotta ones. Ramsay suggests
   that the silver ones would naturally be melted down. The date is too
   late anyhow to identify the Demetrius who was [neopoios] with the
   Demetrius [argurokopos] who made little silver temples of Artemis,
   though B does not have the word [argurous]. The poor votaries would buy
   the terra-cotta ones, the rich the silver shrines (Ramsay, Paul the
   Traveller, p. 278). These small models of the temple with the statue of
   Artemis inside would be set up in the houses or even worn as amulets.
   It is a pity that the Revised Version renders Artemis here. Diana as
   the Ephesian Artemis is quite distinct from the Greek Artemis, the
   sister of Apollo, the Diana of the Romans. This temple, built in the
   6th century B.C., was burnt by Herostratus Oct. 13 B.C. 356, the night
   when Alexander the Great was born. It was restored and was considered
   one of the seven wonders of the world. Artemis was worshipped as the
   goddess of fertility, like the Lydian Cybele, a figure with many
   breasts. The great festival in May would offer Demetrius a golden
   opportunity for the sale of the shrines. Brought no little business
   [pareicheto ouk oligen ergasian]. Imperfect middle, continued to bring
   (furnish, provide). The middle accents the part that Demetrius played
   as the leader of the guild of silversmiths, work for himself and for
   them. Unto the craftsmen [tais technitais]. The artisans from [techne]
   (craft, art). Trade guilds were common in the ancient world. Demetrius
   had probably organized this guild and provided the capital for the
   enterprise.

   19:25 Whom he gathered together [hous sunathroisas]. First aorist
   active participle of [sunathroizO], old verb to assemble together
   [athroos], a crowd), in the N.T. only here and Ac 12:12. With the
   workmen of like occupation [kai tous peri ta toiauta ergatas]. "And the
   workmen concerning such things," apparently those who made the marble
   and terra-cotta shrines who would also be affected in the same way. It
   was a gathering of the associated trades, not for a strike, for
   employer and employees met together, but in protest against the
   preaching of Paul. We have our wealth [he euporia hemin estin]. The
   wealth is to us (dative of possession). This old word for wealth occurs
   here alone in the N.T. It is from [eu] and [poros], easy to pass
   through, easy to accomplish, to be well off, wealthy, welfare, weal,
   well-being, rich. Demetrius appeals to this knowledge and self-interest
   of the artisans as the basis for their zeal for Artemis, piety for
   revenue.

   19:26 At Ephesus [Ephesou]. Genitive of place as also with [Asias]
   (Asia). Cf. Robertson, Grammar, pp. 494f. This Paul [ho Paulos houtos].
   Contemptuous use of [houtos]. Hath turned away [metestesen]. Changed,
   transposed. First aorist active indicative, did change. Tribute to
   Paul's powers as a preacher borne out by Luke's record in 19:10. There
   may be an element of exaggeration on the part of Demetrius to incite
   the workmen to action, for the worship of Artemis was their wealth.
   Paul had cut the nerve of their business. There had long been a Jewish
   colony in Ephesus, but their protest against idolatry was as nothing
   compared with Paul's preaching (Furneaux). Which are made with hands
   [hoi dia cheirOn ginomenoi]. Note the present tense, made from time to
   time. No doubt Paul had put the point sharply as in Athens (Ac 17:29).
   Isaiah (Isa 44:9-17) had pictured graphically the absurdity of
   worshipping stocks and stones, flatly forbidden by the Old Testament
   (Ex 20:4; Ps 135:15-18). The people identified their gods with the
   images of them and Demetrius reflects that point of view. He was
   jealous of the brand of gods turned out by his factory. The artisans
   would stand by him on this point. It was a reflection on their work.

   19:27 This our trade [touto to meros]. Part, share, task, job, trade.
   Come into disrepute [eis apelegmon elthein]. Not in the old writers,
   but in LXX and Koine. Literally, reputation, exposure, censure,
   rejection after examination, and so disrepute. Their business of making
   gods would lose caste as the liquor trade (still called the trade in
   England) has done in our day. They felt this keenly and so Demetrius
   names it first. They felt it in their pockets. Of the great goddess
   Artemis [tes megales theas Artemidos]. She was generally known as the
   Great [he Megale]. An inscription found at Ephesus calls her "the
   greatest god" [he megiste theos]. The priests were eunuchs and there
   were virgin priestesses and a lower order of slaves known as
   temple-sweepers [neOkoroi], verse 35). They had wild orgiastic
   exercises that were disgraceful with their Corybantic processions and
   revelries. Be made of no account [eis outhen logisthenai]. Be reckoned
   as nothing, first aorist passive infinitive of [logizomai] and [eis].
   Should even be deposed of her magnificence [mellein te kai
   kathaireisthai tes megaleiotetos autes]. Note the present infinitive
   after [mellein], ablative case (so best MSS.) after [kathaireO], to
   take down, to depose, to deprive of. The word [megaleiotes] occurs also
   in Lu 9:43 (the majesty of God) and in 2Pe 1:16 of the transfiguration
   of Christ. It is already in the LXX and Deissmann (Light from the
   Ancient East, p. 363) thinks that the word runs parallel with terms
   used in the emperor-cult. All Asia and the world [hole (he) Asia kai
   (he) oikoumene]. See 11:28 for same use of [oikoumene]. An
   exaggeration, to be sure, but Pausanias says that no deity was more
   widely worshipped. Temples of Artemis have been found in Spain and
   Gaul. Multitudo errantium non efficit veritatem (Bengel). Even today
   heathenism has more followers than Christianity. To think that all this
   splendour was being set at naught by one man and a despised Jew at
   that!

   19:28 They were filled with wrath [genomenoi plereis thumou]. Having
   become full of wrath. Cried out [ekrazon]. Inchoative imperfect, began
   to cry out and kept it up continuously. Reiteration was characteristic
   of the orgiastic exercises. The Codex Bezae adds after [thumou]
   (wrath): [Dramontes eis ten amphodon] (running into the street), which
   they certainly did after the speech of Demetrius. Great is Artemis of
   the Ephesians [Megale he Artemis EphesiOn]. D (Codex Bezae) omits [he]
   (the) and makes it read: "Great Artemis of the Ephesians." This was the
   usual cry of the votaries in their orgies as the inscriptions show, an
   ejaculatory outcry or prayer instead of an argument as the other MSS.
   have it. That is vivid and natural (Ramsay, Church in the Roman Empire,
   pp. 135ff.). Yet on this occasion the artisans were making an
   argumentative protest and plea against Paul. An inscription at
   Dionysopolis has "Great is Apollo."

   19:29 With the confusion [tes sugchuseOs]. Genitive case after
   [eplesthe]. An old word, but in the N.T. only here, from verb
   [sugcheO], to pour together like a flood (only in Acts in the N.T.).
   Vivid description of the inevitable riot that followed "the appearance
   of such a body in the crowded agora of an excitable city" (Rackham)
   "vociferating the city's watch-word." They rushed [hOrmesan].
   Ingressive aorist active indicative of [hormaO], old verb for impetuous
   dashing, a case of mob psychology (mob mind), with one accord
   [homothumadon] as in Ac 1:14, etc.). Into the theatre [eis to
   theatron]. A place for seeing [theaomai] spectacles, originally for
   dramatic representation (Thucydides, Herodotus), then for the
   spectators, then for the spectacle or show (1Co 4:9). The theatre
   (amphitheatre) at Ephesus can still be traced in the ruins (Wood,
   Ephesus) and shows that it was of enormous size capable of seating
   fifty-six thousand persons (some estimate it only 24,500). It was the
   place for large public gatherings of any sort out of doors like our
   football and baseball parks. In particular, gladiatorial shows were
   held in these theatres. Having seized Gaius and Aristarchus men of
   Macedonia [sunarpasantes Gaion kai Aristarchon Makedonas]. See 6:12 for
   this same verb. They wanted some victims for this "gladiatorial" show.
   These two men were "Paul's companions in travel" [sunekdemous Paulou],
   together [sun] with Paul in being abroad, away from home or people
   [ek-demous], late word, in the N.T. only here and 2Co 8:19). How the
   mob got hold of Gaius (Ac 20:4) and Aristarchus (20:4; 27:2; Col 4:10;
   Phm 1:24) we do not know whether by accidental recognition or by search
   after failure to get Paul. In Ro 16:4 Paul speaks of Priscilla and
   Aquila as those "who for my life laid down their own necks." Paul lived
   with them in Ephesus as in Corinth. It is possible that Demetrius led
   the mob to their house and that they refused to allow Paul to go or to
   be seized at the risk of their own lives. Paul himself may have been
   desperately ill at this time as we know was the case once during his
   stay in Ephesus when he felt the answer of death in himself (2Co 1:9)
   and when God rescued him. That may mean that, ill as he was, Paul
   wanted to go and face the mob in the theatre, knowing that it meant
   certain death.

   19:30 And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people [Paulou de
   boulomenou eiselthein eis ton demon]. Genitive absolute. Plainly Paul
   wanted to face the howling mob, whether it was the occasion pictured in
   2Co 1:9 or not. "St. Paul was not the man to leave his comrades in the
   lurch" (Knowling). Suffered him not [ouk eiOn auton]. Imperfect of
   [eaO], common verb to allow, what Gildersleeve called the negative
   imperfect (Robertson, Grammar, p. 885), denoting resistance to
   pressure. The more Paul insisted on going the more the disciples
   refused to agree to it and they won.

   19:31 Certain also of the chief officers of Asia [tines de kai tOn
   AsiarchOn]. These "Asiarchs" were ten officers elected by cities in the
   province who celebrated at their own cost public games and festivals
   (Page). Each province had such a group of men chosen, as we now know
   from inscriptions, to supervise the funds connected with the worship of
   the emperor, to preside at games and festivals even when the temple
   services were to gods like Artemis. Only rich men could act, but the
   position was eagerly sought. Being his friends [ontes autOi philoi].
   Evidently the Asiarchs had a high opinion of Paul and were unwilling
   for him to expose his life to a wild mob during the festival of
   Artemis. They were at least tolerant toward Paul and his preaching. "It
   was an Asiarch who at Smyrna resisted the cry of the populace to throw
   Polycarp to the lions" (Furneaux). Besought him [parekaloun auton].
   Imperfect active, showing that the messengers sent had to insist over
   Paul's protest. "Not to adventure himself" [me dounai heauton]. It was
   a hazard, a rash adventure "to give himself" (second aorist active
   infinitive of [didOmi]. Just this sense of "adventure" with the idiom
   occurs only here in the N.T., though in Polybius V., 14, 9. But the
   phrase itself Paul uses of Jesus who gave himself for our sins (Ga 1:4;
   1Ti 2:6; Tit 2:14). It is not the first time that friends had rescued
   Paul from peril (Ac 9:25,30; 17:10,14). The theatre was no place for
   Paul. It meant certain death.

   19:32 Some therefore cried one thing and some another [alloi men oun
   allo ti ekrazon]. This classical use of [allos allo] (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 747) appears also in 2:12; 21:34. Literally, "others cried
   another thing." The imperfect shows the repetition (kept on crying) and
   confusion which is also distinctly stated. For the assembly was in
   confusion [en gar he ekklesia sunkechumene]. The reason for the
   previous statement. Periphrastic past perfect passive of [sugcheO,
   sugchunO (-unnO)], to pour together, to commingle as in verse 29
   [sugchuseOs]. It was not an "assembly" [ekklesia, ek, kaleO], to call
   out), but a wholly irregular, disorganized mob in a state (perfect
   tense) of confusion. There was "a lawful assembly" (verse 39), but this
   mob was not one. Luke shows his contempt for this mob (Furneaux). Had
   come together [sunelelutheisan]. Past perfect active of [sunerchomai].
   It was an assembly only in one sense. For some reason Demetrius who was
   responsible for the mob preferred now to keep in the background, though
   he was known to be the ring-leader of the gathering ( verse 38). It was
   just a mob that shouted because others did.

   19:33 And they brought Alexander out of the crowd [ek de tou ochlou
   sunebibasan Alexandron]. The correct text (Aleph A B) has this verb
   [sunebibasan] (from [sunbibazO], to put together) instead of
   [proebibasan] (from [probibazO], to put forward). It is a graphic word,
   causal of [bainO], to go, and occurs in Ac 16:10; Col 2:19; Eph 4:16.
   Evidently some of the Jews grew afraid that the mob would turn on the
   Jews as well as on the Christians. Paul was a Jew and so was
   Aristarchus, one of the prisoners. The Jews were as strongly opposed to
   idolatry as were the Christians. The Jews putting him forward
   [probalontOn auton tOn IoudaiOn]. Genitive absolute of the second
   aorist active participle of [proballO], old verb to push forward as
   leaves in the spring (Lu 21:30). In the N.T. only in these two
   passages. Alexandria had already disgraceful scenes of Jew-baiting and
   there was real peril now in Ephesus with this wild mob. So Alexander
   was pushed forward as the champion to defend the Jews to the excited
   mob. He may be the same Alexander the coppersmith who did Paul much
   evil (2Ti 4:14), against whom Paul will warn Timothy then in Ephesus.
   "The Jews were likely to deal in the copper and silver required for the
   shrines, so he may have had some trade connexion with the craftsmen
   which would give him influence" (Furneaux). Beckoned with the hand
   [kataseisas ten cheira]. Old verb [kataseiO], to shake down, here the
   hand, rapidly waving the hand up and down to get a hearing. In the N.T.
   elsewhere only in Ac 12:17; 13:16; 21:40 where "with the hand" [tei
   cheiri], instrumental case) is used instead of [ten cheira] (the
   accusative). Would have made a defence unto the people [ethelen
   apologeisthai tOi demOi]. Imperfect active, wanted to make a defence,
   tried to, started to, but apparently never got out a word.
   [Apologeisthai] (present middle infinitive, direct middle, to defend
   oneself), regular word for formal apology, but in N.T. only by Luke and
   Paul (twice in Gospel, six times in Acts, and in Ro 2:15; 2Co 12:19).

   19:34 When they perceived [epignontes]. Recognizing, coming to know
   fully and clearly [epi-], second aorist (ingressive) active participle
   of [epiginOskO]. The masculine plural is left as nominative absolute or
   [pendens] without a verb. The rioters saw at once that Alexander was
   [estin], present tense retained in indirect assertion) a Jew by his
   features. An with one voice cried out [phOne egeneto mia ek pantOn
   krazontOn]. Anacoluthon or construction according to sense. Literally,
   "one voice arose from all crying." [KrazontOn] agrees in case
   (ablative) with [pantOn], but Aleph A have [krazontes]. This loose
   construction is not uncommon (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 436f.). Now at
   last the crowd became unanimous (one voice) at the sight of a hated Jew
   about to defend their attacks on the worship of Artemis. The unanimity
   lasted "about the space of two hours" [hosei epi hOras duo], "as if for
   two hours." Their creed centred in this prolonged yell: "Great is
   Artemis of the Ephesians" with which the disturbance started (verse
   28).

   19:35 The town-clerk [ho grammateus]. Ephesus was a free city and
   elected its own officers and the recorder or secretary was the chief
   magistrate of the city, though the proconsul of the province of Asia
   resided there. This officer is not a mere secretary of another officer
   or like the copyists and students of the law among the Jews, but the
   most influential person in Ephesus who drafted decrees with the aid of
   the [strategoi], had charge of the city's money, was the power in
   control of the assembly, and communicated directly with the proconsul.
   Inscriptions at Ephesus give frequently this very title for their chief
   officer and the papyri have it also. The precise function varied in
   different cities. His name appeared on the coin at Ephesus issued in
   his year of office. Had quieted the multitude [katasteilas ton ochlon].
   First aorist active participle of [katastellO], to send down, arrange
   dress (Euripides), lower (Plutarch), restrain (papyrus example), only
   twice in the N.T. (here and verse 36, be quiet), but in LXX and
   Josephus. He evidently took the rostrum and his very presence as the
   city's chief officer had a quieting effect on the billowy turmoil and a
   semblance of order came. He waited, however, till the hubbub had nearly
   exhausted itself (two hours) and did not speak till there was a chance
   to be heard. Saith [phesin]. Historical present for vividness. How
   that. Merely participle [ousan] and accusative [polin] in indirect
   discourse, no conjunction at all (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1040ff.),
   common idiom after [ginOskO], to know. Temple-keeper [neOkoron]. Old
   word from [neOs] [naos)], temple, and [koreO], to sweep. Warden,
   verger, cleaner of the temple, a sacristan. So in Xenophon and Plato.
   Inscriptions so describe Ephesus as [neOkoron tes Artemidos] as Luke
   has it here and also applied to the imperial cultus which finally had
   several such temples in Ephesus. Other cities claimed the same honour
   of being [neOkoros], but it was the peculiar boast of Ephesus because
   of the great temple of Artemis. A coin of A.D. 65 describes Ephesus as
   [neOkoros]. There are papyri examples of the term applied to
   individuals, one to Priene as [neOkoros] of the temple in Ephesus
   (Moulton and Milligan, Vocabulary). And of the image which fell down
   from Jupiter [kai tou diopetous]. Supply [agalma] (image), "the from
   heaven-fallen image." From Zeus [Dios] and [petO] [piptO, pipetO], to
   fall. Zeus (Jupiter) was considered lord of the sky or heaven and that
   is the idea in [diopetous] here. The legend about a statue fallen from
   heaven occurs concerning the statue of Artemis at Tauris, Minerva at
   Athens, etc. Thus the recorder soothed the vanity (Rackham) of the
   crowd by appeal to the world-wide fame of Ephesus as sacristan of
   Artemis and of her heaven-fallen image.

   19:36 Cannot be gainsaid [anantiretOn oun ontOn]. Genitive absolute
   with [oun] (therefore). Undeniable [an, anti, retos], verbal adjective.
   Occasionally in late Greek (Polybius, etc.), only here in N.T., but
   adverb [anantiretOs] in Ac 10:29. These legends were accepted as true
   and appeased the mob. Ye ought [deon estin]. It is necessary.
   Periphrastic present indicative instead of [dei] like 1Pe 1:6; 1Ti
   5:13f. Be quiet [katestalmenous]. Perfect passive participle of
   [katastellO] (see verse 35). Rash [propetes]. Old adjective from [pro]
   and [petO], to fall forward, headlong, precipitate. In the N.T. only
   here and 2Ti 3:4, though common in the Koine. Better look before you
   leap.

   19:37 Neither robbers of temples [oute hierosulous]. Common word in
   Greek writers from [hieron], temple, and [sulaO], to rob, be guilty of
   sacrilege. The word is found also on inscriptions in Ephesus. The Jews
   were sometimes guilty of this crime (Ro 2:22), since the heathen
   temples often had vast treasures like banks. The ancients felt as
   strongly about temple-robbing as westerners used to feel about a
   horse-thief. Nor blasphemers of our goddess [oute blasphemountas ten
   theon hemOn]. Nor those who blasphemed our goddess. That is to say,
   these men (Gaius and Aristarchus) as Christians had so conducted
   themselves (Col 4:5) that no charge could be placed against them either
   in act (temple-robbery) or word (blasphemy). They had done a rash thing
   since these men are innocent. Paul had used tact in Ephesus as in
   Athens in avoiding illegalities.

   19:38 Have a matter against any one [echousin pros tina logon]. For
   this use of [echO logon] with [pros] see Mt 5:32; Col 3:13. The
   town-clerk names Demetrius and the craftsmen [technitai] as the parties
   responsible for the riot. The courts are open [agoraioi agontai].
   Supply [hemerai] (days), court days are kept, or [sunodoi],
   court-meetings are now going on, Vulgate conventus forenses aguntur.
   Old adjective from [agora] (forum) marketplace where trials were held.
   Cf. Ac 17:4. There were regular court days whether they were in session
   then or not. And there are proconsuls [kai anthupatoi eisin]. Asia was
   a senatorial province and so had proconsuls (general phrase) though
   only one at a time, "a rhetorical plural" (Lightfoot). Page quotes from
   an inscription of the age of Trajan on an aqueduct at Ephesus in which
   some of Luke's very words occur [neOkoros, anthupatos, grammateus,
   demos]. Let them accuse one another [egkaleitOsan allelois]. Present
   active imperative of [egkaleO] [en, kaleO], old verb to call in one's
   case, to bring a charge against, with the dative. Luke uses the verb
   six times in Acts for judicial proceedings (19:38, 40; 23:28, 29; 26:2,
   7). The town-clerk makes a definite appeal to the mob for orderly legal
   procedure as opposed to mob violence in a matter where money and
   religious prejudice unite, a striking rebuke to so-called lynch-law
   proceedings in lands today where Christianity is supposed to prevail.

   19:39 Anything about other matters [ti peraiterO]. Most MSS. here have
   [ti peri heterOn], but B b Vulgate read [ti peraiterO] as in Plato's
   [Phaedo]. Several papyri examples of it also. It is comparative
   [peraiteros] of [pera], beyond. Note also [epi] in [epizeteite].
   Charges of illegal conduct (Page) should be settled in the regular
   legal way. But, if you wish to go further and pass resolutions about
   the matter exciting you, "it shall be settled in the regular assembly"
   [en tOi ennomOi ekklesiai]. "In the lawful assembly," not by a mob like
   this. Wood (Ephesus) quotes an inscription there with this very phrase
   "at every lawful assembly" [kata pasan ennomon ekklesian]. The Roman
   officials alone could give the sanction for calling such a lawful or
   regular assembly. The verb [epiluO] is an old one, but in the N.T. only
   here and Mr 4:34 (which see) where Jesus privately opened or disclosed
   the parables to the disciples. The papyri give examples of the verb in
   financial transactions as well as of the metaphorical sense. The
   solution will come in the lawful assembly, not in a riot like this. See
   also 2Pe 1:20 where the substantive [epilusis] occurs for disclosure or
   revelation (prophecy).

   19:40 For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day's
   riot [kai gar kinduneuomen egkaleisthai staseOs peri tes semeron]. The
   text is uncertain. The text of Westcott and Hort means "to be accused
   of insurrection concerning today's assembly." The peril was real.
   [Kinduneuomen], from [kindunos], danger, peril. Old verb, but in the
   N.T. only here and Lu 8:23; B.C. 1Co 15:30. There being no cause for it
   [medenos aitiou huparchontos]. Genitive absolute with [aitios], common
   adjective (cf. [aitia], cause) though in N.T. only here and Heb 5:9; Lu
   23:4, 14, 22. And as touching it [peri hou]. "Concerning which." But
   what? No clear antecedent, only the general idea. Give an account of
   this concourse [apodounai logon peri tes sustrophes tautes]. Rationem
   reddere. They will have to explain matters to the proconsul.
   [Sustrophe] (from [sun], together, [strephO], to turn) is a late word
   for a conspiracy (Ac 23:12) and a disorderly riot as here (Polybius).
   In Ac 28:12 [sustrephO] is used of gathering up a bundle of sticks and
   of men combining in Mt 17:22. Seneca says that there was nothing on
   which the Romans looked with such jealousy as a tumultuous meeting.

   19:41 Dismissed the assembly [apelusen ten ekklesian]. The town-clerk
   thus gave a semblance of law and order to the mob by formally
   dismissing them, this much to protect them against the charge to which
   they were liable. This vivid, graphic picture given by Luke has all the
   earmarks of historical accuracy. Paul does not describe the incidents
   in his letters, was not in the theatre in fact, but Luke evidently
   obtained the details from one who was there. Aristarchus, we know, was
   with Luke in Caesarea and in Rome and could have supplied all the data
   necessary. Certainly both Gaius and Aristarchus were lively witnesses
   of these events since their own lives were involved.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 20

   20:1 After the uproar was ceased [meta to pausasthai ton thorubon].
   Literally, after the ceasing (accusative of articular aorist middle
   infinitive of [pauO], to make cease) as to the uproar (accusative of
   general reference). Noise and riot, already in Mt 26:5; 27:24; Mr 5:38;
   14:2; and see in Ac 21:34; 24:18. Pictures the whole incident as bustle
   and confusion. Took leave [aspamenos]. First aorist middle participle
   of [aspazomai], old verb from [a] intensive and [spaO], to draw, to
   draw to oneself in embrace either in greeting or farewell. Here it is
   in farewell as in 21:6. Salutation in 21:7, 19. Departed for to go into
   Macedonia [exelthen poreuesthai eis Makedonian]. Both verbs, single act
   and then process. Luke here condenses what was probably a whole year of
   Paul's life and work as we gather from II Corinthians, one of Paul's
   "weighty and powerful" letters as his enemies called them (2Co 10:10).
   "This epistle more than any other is a revelation of S. Paul's own
   heart: it is his spiritual autobiography and apologia pro vita sua."

   20:2 Those parts [ta mere ekeina]. We have no way of knowing why Luke
   did not tell of Paul's stay in Troas (2Co 2:12f.) nor of meeting Titus
   in Macedonia (2Co 2:13-7:16) nor of Paul's visit to Illyricum (Ro
   15:19f.) to give time for II Corinthians to do its work (2Co 13), one
   of the most stirring experiences in Paul's whole career when he opened
   his heart to the Corinthians and won final victory in the church by the
   help of Titus who also helped him round up the great collection in
   Achaia. He wrote II Corinthians during this period after Titus arrived
   from Corinth. The unity of II Corinthians is here assumed. Paul
   probably met Luke again in Macedonia, but all this is passed by except
   by the general phrase: "had given them much exhortation" [parakalesas
   autous logOi pollOi]. Literally, "having exhorted them (the Macedonian
   brethren) with much talk" (instrumental case). Into Greece [eis ten
   Hellada]. That is, Achaia (18:12; 19:21), and particularly Corinth,
   whither he had at last come again after repeated attempts, pauses, and
   delays (2Co 13:1). Now at last the coast was clear and Paul apparently
   had an open door in Corinth during these three months, so completely
   had Titus at last done away with the opposition of the Judaizers there.

   20:3 When he had spent three months there [poiesas menas treis].
   Literally, "having done three months," the same idiom in Ac 14:33;
   18:23; Jas 5:13. During this period Paul may have written Galatians as
   Lightfoot argued and certainly did Romans. We do not have to say that
   Luke was ignorant of Paul's work during this period, only that he did
   not choose to enlarge upon it. And a plot was laid against him by the
   Jews [genomenes epiboules autOi hupo tOn IoudaiOn]. Genitive absolute,
   "a plot by the Jews having come against him." [Epiboule] is an old word
   for a plot against one. In the N.T. only in Acts (9:24; 20:3, 19;
   23:30). Please note that this plot is by the Jews, not the Judaizers
   whom Paul discusses so vehemently in 2Co 10-13. They had given Paul
   much anguish of heart as is shown in I Cor. and in 2Co 1-7, but that
   trouble seems now past. It is Paul's old enemies in Corinth who had
   cherished all these years their defeat at the hands of Gallio (Ac
   18:5-17) who now took advantage of Paul's plans for departure to
   compass his death if possible. As he was about to set sail for Syria
   [mellonti anagesthai eis ten Surian]. The participle [mellonti] agrees
   in case (dative) with [autOi]. For the sense of intending see also
   verse 13. [Anagesthai] (present middle infinitive) is the common word
   for putting out to sea (going up, they said, from land) as in 13:13. He
   determined [egeneto gnOmes]. The best MSS. here read [gnOmes]
   (predicate ablative of source like [epiluseOs], 2Pe 1:20, Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 514), not [gnOme] (nominative). "He became of opinion." The
   Jews had heard of Paul's plan to sail for Syria and intended in the
   hurly-burly either to kill him at the docks in Cenchreae or to push him
   overboard from the crowded pilgrim ship bound for the passover.
   Fortunately Paul learned of their plot and so eluded them by going
   through Macedonia. The Codex Bezae adds here that "the Spirit bade him
   return into Macedonia."

   20:4 Accompanied him [suneipeto autOi]. Imperfect of [sunepomai], old
   and common verb, but only here in the N.T. The singular is used
   agreeing with the first name mentioned [SOpatros] and to be supplied
   with each of the others. Textus Receptus adds here "into Asia" [achri
   tes Asias], as far as Asia), but the best documents (Aleph B Vulg. Sah
   Boh) do not have it. As a matter of fact, Trophimus went as far as
   Jerusalem (Ac 21:29) and Aristarchus as far as Rome (27:2; Col 4:10),
   The phrase could apply only to Sopatros. It is not clear though
   probable that Luke means to say that these seven brethren, delegates of
   the various churches (2Co 8:19-23) started from Corinth with Paul. Luke
   notes the fact that they accompanied Paul, but the party may really
   have been made up at Philippi where Luke himself joined Paul, the rest
   of the party having gone on to Troas (20:5f.). These were from Roman
   provinces that shared in the collection (Galatia, Asia, Macedonia,
   Achaia). In this list three were from Macedonia, Sopater of Beroea,
   Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica; two from Galatia, Gaius of
   Derbe and Timothy of Lystra; two from Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. It
   is a bit curious that none are named from Achaia. Had Corinth failed
   after all (2Co 8; 9) to raise its share of the collection after such
   eager pledging? Rackham suggests that they may have turned their part
   over directly to Paul. Luke joined Paul in Philippi and could have
   handled the money from Achaia. It was an important event and Paul took
   the utmost pains to remove any opportunity for scandal in the handling
   of the funds.

   20:5 Were waiting for us in Troas [emenon hemas en Troiadi]. Here again
   we have "us" for the first time since chapter 16 where Paul was with
   Luke in Philippi. Had Luke remained all this time in Philippi? We do
   not know, but he is with Paul now till Rome is reached. The seven
   brethren of verse 4 went on ahead from Philippi to Troas while Paul
   remained with Luke in Philippi.

   20:6 After the days of unleavened bread [meta tas hemeras tOn azumOn].
   Paul was a Jew, though a Christian, and observed the Jewish feasts,
   though he protested against Gentiles being forced to do it (Ga 4:10;
   Col 2:16). Was Luke a proselyte because he notes the Jewish feasts as
   here and in Ac 27:9? He may have noted them merely because Paul
   observed them. But this passover was a year after that in Ephesus when
   Paul expected to remain there till Pentecost (1Co 16:8). He was hoping
   now to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost (Ac 20:16) as he did. We do not
   know the precise year, possibly A.D. 56 or 57. In five days [achri
   hemerOn pente]. Up to five days (cf. Lu 2:37). D has [pemptaioi],
   "fifth day men," a correct gloss. Cf. [deuteraioi], second-day men (Ac
   28:13). In Ac 16:11 they made the voyage in two days. Probably adverse
   winds held them back here. Seven days [hepta hemeras]. To atone for the
   short stay in Troas before (2Co 2:12f.) when Paul was so restless. Now
   he preaches a week to them.

   20:7 Upon the first day of the week [en de miai tOn sabbatOn]. The
   cardinal [miai] used here for the ordinal [prOtei] (Mr 16:9) like the
   Hebrew ehadh as in Mr 16:2; Mt 28:1; Lu 24:1; Joh 20:1 and in harmony
   with the Koine idiom (Robertson, Grammar, p. 671). Either the singular
   (Mr 16:9) [sabbatou] or the plural [sabbaton] as here was used for the
   week (sabbath to sabbath). For the first time here we have services
   mentioned on the first day of the week though in 1Co 16:2 it is implied
   by the collections stored on that day. In Re 1:10 the Lord's day seems
   to be the day of the week on which Jesus rose from the grave. Worship
   on the first day of the week instead of the seventh naturally arose in
   Gentile churches, though Joh 20:26 seems to mean that from the very
   start the disciples began to meet on the first (or eighth) day. But
   liberty was allowed as Paul makes plain in Ro 14:5f. When we were
   gathered together [sunegmenOn hemOn]. Genitive absolute, perfect
   passive participle of [sunagO], to gather together, a formal meeting of
   the disciples. See this verb used for gatherings of disciples in Ac
   4:31; 11:26; 14:27; 15:6,30; 19:7,8; 1Co 5:4. In Heb 10:25 the
   substantive [episunagOgen] is used for the regular gatherings which
   some were already neglecting. It is impossible for a church to flourish
   without regular meetings even if they have to meet in the catacombs as
   became necessary in Rome. In Russia today the Soviets are trying to
   break up conventicles of Baptists. They probably met on our Saturday
   evening, the beginning of the first day at sunset. So these Christians
   began the day (Sunday) with worship. But, since this is a Gentile
   community, it is quite possible that Luke means our Sunday evening as
   the time when this meeting occurs, and the language in Joh 20:19 "it
   being evening on that day the first day of the week" naturally means
   the evening following the day, not the evening preceding the day. To
   break bread [klasai arton]. First aorist active infinitive of purpose
   of [klaO]. The language naturally bears the same meaning as in 2:42,
   the Eucharist or the Lord's Supper which usually followed the [Agape].
   See 1Co 10:16. The time came, when the [Agape] was no longer observed,
   perhaps because of the abuses noted in 1Co 11:20ff. Rackham argues that
   the absence of the article with bread here and its presence [ton arton]
   in verse 11 shows that the [Agape] is ] referred to in verse 7 and the
   Eucharist in verse 11, but not necessarily so because [ton arton] may
   merely refer to [arton] in verse 7. At any rate it should be noted that
   Paul, who conducted this service, was not a member of the church in
   Troas, but only a visitor. Discoursed [dielegeto]. Imperfect middle
   because he kept on at length. Intending [mellO]. Being about to, on the
   point of. On the morrow [tei epaurion]. Locative case with [hemerai]
   understood after the adverb [epaurion]. If Paul spoke on our Saturday
   evening, he made the journey on the first day of the week (our Sunday)
   after sunrise. If he spoke on our Sunday evening, then he left on our
   Monday morning. Prolonged his speech [Pareteinen ton logon]. Imperfect
   active (same form as aorist) of [parateinO], old verb to stretch beside
   or lengthwise, to prolong. Vivid picture of Paul's long sermon which
   went on and on till midnight [mechri mesonuktiou]. Paul's purpose to
   leave early next morning seemed to justify the long discourse.
   Preachers usually have some excuse for the long sermon which is not
   always clear to the exhausted audience.

   20:8 Many lights [lampades hikanai]. It was dark at night since the
   full moon (passover) was three weeks behind. These lamps were probably
   filled with oil and had wicks that flickered and smoked. They would not
   meet in the dark. In the upper room [en tOi huperOiOi]. As in 1:13
   which see.

   20:9 Sat [kathezomenos]. Sitting (present middle participle describing
   his posture). In the window [epi tes thuridos]. Old word diminutive
   from [thura], door, a little door. Latticed window (no glass) opened
   because of the heat from the lamps and the crowd. Our window was once
   spelt windore (Hudibras), perhaps from the wrong idea that it was
   derived from wind and door. Eutychus (a common slave name) was sitting
   on [epi] the window sill. Ahaziah "fell down through a lattice in his
   upper chamber" (2Ki 1:2). In the N.T. [thuris] only here and 2Co 11:33
   [dia thuridos] through which Paul was let down through the wall in
   Damascus. Borne down with deep sleep [katapheromenos hupnOi bathei].
   Present passive participle of [katapherO], to bear down, and followed
   by instrumental case [hupnOi]. Describes the gradual process of going
   into deep sleep. Great medical writers use [bathus] with [hupnos] as we
   do today (deep sleep). D here has [basei] (heavy) for [bathei] (deep).
   As Paul discoursed yet longer [dialegomenou tou Paulou epi pleion].
   Genitive absolute of present middle participle of [dialegomai] (cf.
   verse 7). with [epi pleion]. Eutychus struggled bravely to keep awake,
   vainly hoping that Paul would finish. But he went on "for more." Being
   born down by his sleep [katenechtheis apo tou hupnou]. First aorist
   (effective) passive showing the final result of the process described
   by [katapheromenos], finally overcome as a result of [apo] the (note
   article [tou] sleep (ablative case). These four participles
   [kathezomenos, katapheromenos, dialegomenou, katenechtheis] have no
   connectives, but are distinguished clearly by case and tense. The
   difference between the present [katapheromenos] and the aorist
   [katenechtheis] of the same verb is marked. Fell down [epesen katO].
   Effective aorist active indicative of [piptO] with the adverb [katO],
   though [katapiptO] (compound verb) could have been used (Ac 26:14;
   28:6). Hobart (Medical Language of St. Luke) thinks that Luke shows a
   physician's interest in the causes of the drowsiness of Eutychus (the
   heat, the crowd, the smell of the lamps, the late hour, the long
   discourse). Cf. Lu 22:45. From the third story [apo tou tristegou].
   From [treis] (three) and [stege] (roof), adjective [tristegos] having
   three roofs. Was taken up dead [erthe nekros]. First aorist passive
   indicative of [airO]. Luke does not say [hOs] (as) or [hOsei] (Mr 9:26
   as if). The people considered him dead and Luke the physician seems to
   agree with that view.

   20:10 Fell on him [epepesen autOi]. Second aorist active indicative of
   [epipiptO] with dative case as Elijah did (1Ki 17:21) and Elisha (2Ki
   4:34). Embracing [sunperilabOn]. Second aorist active participle of
   [sunperilambanO], old verb to embrace completely (take hold together
   round), but only here in the N.T. In Ezr 5:3. Make ye no ado [me
   thorubeisthe]. Stop [me] and present middle imperative of [thorubeO]
   making a noise [thorubos] as the people did on the death of Jairus's
   daughter (Mt 9:23 [thoruboumenou] and Mr 5:38 [thorubou] when Jesus
   asked [Ti thorubeisthe?] For his life is in him [he gar psuche autou en
   autOi estin]. This language is relied on by Ramsay, Wendt, Zoeckler to
   show that Eutychus had not really died, but had merely swooned. Paul's
   language would suit that view, but it suits equally well the idea that
   he had just been restored to life and so is indecisive. Furneaux urges
   also the fact that his friends did not bring him back to the meeting
   till morning ( verse 12) as additional evidence that it was a case of
   swooning rather than of death. But this again is not conclusive as they
   would naturally not take him back at once. One will believe here as the
   facts appeal to him.

   20:11 When he was gone up [anabas]. Second aorist active participle in
   sharp contrast to [katabas] (went down) of verse 10. Had broken bread
   [klasas ton arton]. Probably the Eucharist to observe which ordinance
   Paul had come and tarried (verse 7), though some scholars distinguish
   between what took place in verse 7 and verse 11, needlessly so as was
   stated on verse 7. And eaten [kai geusamenos]. The word is used in
   10:10 of eating an ordinary meal and so might apply to the [Agape], but
   it suits equally for the Eucharist. The accident had interrupted Paul's
   sermon so that it was observed now and then Paul resumed his discourse.
   And had talked with them a long while [eph' hikanon te homilesas].
   Luke, as we have seen, is fond of [hikanos] for periods of time, for a
   considerable space of time, "even till break of day" [achri auges]. Old
   word for brightness, radiance like German Auge, English eye, only here
   in the N.T. Occurs in the papyri and in modern Greek for dawn. This
   second discourse lasted from midnight till dawn and was probably more
   informal (as in 10:27) and conversational [homilesas], though our word
   homiletics comes from [homileO] than the discourse before midnight
   [dialegomai], verses 7, 9). He had much to say before he left. So he
   departed [houtOs exelthen]. Thus Luke sums up the result. Paul left
   (went forth) only after all the events narrated by the numerous
   preceding participles had taken place. Effective aorist active
   indicative [exelthen]. [HoutOs] here equals [tum demum], now at length
   (Ac 27:7) as Page shows.

   20:12 They brought the lad alive [egagon ton paida zOnta]. Second
   aorist active indicative of [agO]. Evidently the special friends of the
   lad who now either brought him back to the room or (Rendall) took him
   home to his family. Knowling holds that [zOnta] (living) here is
   pointless unless he had been dead. He had been taken up dead and now
   they brought him living. Not a little [ou metriOs]. Not moderately,
   that is a great deal. Luke is fond of this use of the figure litotes
   (use of the negative) instead of the strong positive (1:5, etc.). D
   (Codex Bezae) has here instead of [egagon] these words: [alpazomenOn de
   autOn egagen ton neaniskon zOnta] (while they were saying farewell he
   brought the young man alive). This reading pictures the joyful scene
   over the lad's restoration as Paul was leaving.

   20:13 To the ship [epi to ploion]. Note article. It is possible that
   Paul's party had chartered a coasting vessel from Philippi or Troas to
   take them to Patara in Lycia. Hence the boat stopped when and where
   Paul wished. That is possible, but not certain, for Paul could simply
   have accommodated himself to the plans of the ship's managers. To take
   in Paul [analambanein ton Paulon]. So in verse 14. Same use in 2Ti
   4:11: "Picking up Mark" [Markon analabOn]. Assos was a seaport south of
   Troas in Mysia in the province of Asia. He had appointed [diatetagmenos
   en]. Past perfect periphrastic middle of [diatassO], old verb to give
   orders (military in particular). To go by land [pezeuein]. Present
   active infinitive of [pezeuO], old verb to go on foot, not on horse
   back or in a carriage or by ship. Here only in the N.T. It was about
   twenty miles over a paved Roman road, much shorter (less than half)
   than the sea voyage around Cape Lectum. It was a beautiful walk in the
   spring-time and no doubt Paul enjoyed it whatever his reason was for
   going thus to Assos while the rest went by sea. Certainly he was
   entitled to a little time alone, this one day, as Jesus sought the
   Father in the night watches (Mt 14:23).

   20:14 Met us [suneballen hemin]. Imperfect active where the aorist
   [sunebalen], as C D have it) would seem more natural. It may mean that
   as soon as [hOs] Paul "came near or began to meet us" (inchoative
   imperfect), we picked him up. Luke alone in the N.T. uses [sunballO] to
   bring or come together either in a friendly sense as here or as enemies
   (Lu 14:31). To Mitylene [eis Mitulenen]. The capital of Lesbos about
   thirty miles from Assos, an easy day's sailing.

   20:15 We came over against Chios [katentesamen antikrus Chiou]. Luke
   uses this Koine verb several times (16:1; 18:19), meaning to come right
   down in front of and the notion of [anta] is made plainer by
   [antikrus], face to face with, common "improper" preposition only here
   in the N.T. They probably lay off the coast (anchoring) during the
   night instead of putting into the harbour. The Island of Chios is about
   eight miles from the mainland. The next day [tei heterai]. The third
   day in reality from Assos (the fourth from Troas), in contrast with
   [tei epiousei] just before for Chios. We touched at Samos [parebalomen
   eis Samon]. Second aorist active of [paraballO], to throw alongside, to
   cross over, to put in by. So Thucydides III. 32. Only here in the N.T.
   though in Textus Receptus in Mr 4:30. The word parable [parabole] is
   from this verb. The Textus Receptus adds here [kai meinantes en
   TrogulliOi] (and remaining at Trogyllium), but clearly not genuine. In
   passing from Chios to Samos they sailed past Ephesus to save time for
   Pentecost in Jerusalem (verse 16), if in control of the ship, or
   because the captain allowed Paul to have his way. The island of Samos
   is still further down the coast below Chios. It is not stated whether a
   stop was made here or not. The day after [tei echomenei]. The day
   holding itself next to the one before. Note Luke's three terms in this
   verse [tei epiousei, tei heterai, tei echomenei]. This would be the
   fourth from Assos. To Miletus [eis Mileton]. About 28 miles south of
   Ephesus and now the site is several miles from the sea due to the silt
   from the Maeander. This city, once the chief city of the Ionian Greeks,
   was now quite eclipsed by Ephesus.

   20:16 For Paul had determined [kekrikei gar ho Paulos]. Past perfect
   active (correct text) of [krinO] and not the aorist [ekrine]. Either
   Paul controlled the ship or the captain was willing to oblige him. To
   sail past Ephesus [parapleusai ten Epheson]. First aorist active
   infinitive of [parapleO], old verb to sail beside, only here in the
   N.T. That he might not have [hopOs me genetai autOi]. Final clause
   (negative) with aorist middle subjunctive of [ginomai] and dative "that
   it might not happen to him." To spend time [chronotribesai]. First
   aorist active of the late compound verb [chronotribeO] [chronos], time,
   [tribO], to spend), only here in the N.T. The verb [tribO], to rub, to
   wear out by rubbing, lends itself to the idea of wasting time. It was
   only a year ago that Paul had left Ephesus in haste after the riot. It
   was not expedient to go back so soon if he meant to reach Jerusalem by
   Pentecost. Paul clearly felt (Ro 15) that the presentation of this
   collection at Pentecost to the Jewish Christians would have a wholesome
   influence as it had done once before (Ac 11:30). He was hastening
   [espeuden]. Imperfect active of [speudO], old verb to hasten as in Lu
   2:16; 19:56. If it were possible for him [ei dunaton eie autOi].
   Condition of the fourth class (optative mode), if it should be possible
   for him. The form is a remote possibility. It was only some thirty days
   till Pentecost. The day of Pentecost [ten hemeran tes pentekostes].
   Note the accusative case. Paul wanted to be there for the whole day.
   See Ac 2:1 for this very phrase.

   20:17 Called to him [metekalesato]. Aorist middle (indirect) indicative
   of [metakaleO], old verb to call from one place to another [meta] for
   "change"), middle to call to oneself, only in Acts in the N.T. (7:14;
   10:32; 20:17; 24:25). Ephesus was some thirty miles, a stiff day's
   journey each way. They would be with Paul the third day of the stay in
   Miletus. The elders of the church [tous presbuterous tes ekklesias].
   The very men whom Paul terms "bishops" [episkopous] in verse 28 just as
   in Tit 1:5, 7 where both terms [presbuterous, ton episkopon] describe
   the same office. The term "elder" applied to Christian ministers first
   appears in Ac 11:30 in Jerusalem and reappears in 15:4, 6, 22 in
   connection with the apostles and the church. The "elders" are not
   "apostles" but are "bishops" (cf. Php 1:1) and with "deacons"
   constitute the two classes of officers in the early churches. Ignatius
   shows that in the early second century the office of bishop over the
   elders had developed, but Lightfoot has shown that it was not so in the
   first century. Each church, as in Jerusalem, Philippi, Ephesus, had a
   number of "elders" ("bishops") in the one great city church. Hackett
   thinks that other ministers from the neighbourhood also came. It was a
   noble group of preachers and Paul, the greatest preacher of the ages,
   makes a remarkable talk to preachers with all the earmarks of Pauline
   originality (Spitta, Apostelgeschichte, p. 252) as shown by the
   characteristic Pauline words, phrases, ideas current in all his
   Epistles including the Pastoral (testify, course, pure, take heed,
   presbyter, bishop, acquire, apparel). Luke heard this address as he may
   and probably did hear those in Jerusalem and Caesarea (Ac 21-26).
   Furneaux suggests that Luke probably took shorthand notes of the
   address since Galen says that his students took down his medical
   lectures in shorthand: "At any rate, of all the speeches in the Acts
   this contains most of Paul and least of Luke. ... It reveals Paul as
   nothing else does. The man who spoke it is no longer a man of eighteen
   centuries ago: he is of yesterday; of today. He speaks as we speak and
   feels as we feel; or rather as we fain would speak and feel." We have
   seen and listened to Paul speak to the Jews in Antioch in Pisidia as
   Luke pictures the scene, to the uneducated pagans at Lystra, to the
   cultured Greeks in Athens. We shall hear him plead for his life to the
   Jewish mob in Jerusalem, to the Roman governor Felix in Caesarea, to
   the Jewish "King" Herod Agrippa II in Caesarea, and at last to the Jews
   in Rome. But here Paul unbosoms himself to the ministers of the church
   in Ephesus where he had spent three years (longer than with any other
   church) and where he had such varied experiences of prowess and
   persecution. He opens his heart to these men as he does not to the
   average crowd even of believers. It is Paul's Apologia pro sua Vita. He
   will probably not see them again and so the outlook and attitude is
   similar to the farewell discourse of Jesus to the disciples in the
   upper room (Joh 13-17). He warns them about future perils as Jesus had
   done. Paul's words here will repay any preacher's study today. There is
   the same high conception of the ministry here that Paul had already
   elaborated in 2Co 2:12-6:10 (see my Glory of the Ministry). It is a
   fitting time and occasion for Paul to take stock of his ministry at the
   close of the third mission tour. What wonders had God wrought already.

   20:18 Ye yourselves know [humeis epistasthe]. Pronoun expressed and
   emphatic. He appeals to their personal knowledge of his life in
   Ephesus. From the first day that [apo prOtes hemeras aph' hes]. "From
   first day from which." He had first "set foot" [epeben], second aorist
   active indicative of old verb [epibainO], to step upon or step into) in
   Ephesus four years ago in the spring of 51 or 52, but had returned from
   Antioch that autumn. It is now spring of 54 or 55 so that his actual
   ministry in Ephesus was about two and a half years, roughly three years
   (verse 31).

   After what manner I was with you [pOs meth' h-mOn egenomen]. Literally,
   "How I came (from Asia and so was) with you." Cf. 1Th 1:5; 2Th 2:1-10
   where Paul likewise dares to refer boldly to his life while with them
   "all the time" [ton panta chronon]. Accusative of duration of time. So
   far as we know, Paul stuck to Ephesus the whole period. He had devoted
   himself consecratedly to the task in Ephesus. Each pastor is bishop of
   his field and has a golden opportunity to work it for Christ. One of
   the saddest things about the present situation is the restlessness of
   preachers to go elsewhere instead of devoting themselves wholly to the
   task where they are. 19. Serving the Lord [douleuOn tOi kuriOi]. It was
   Paul's glory to be the [doulos] (bond-slave) as in Ro 1:1; Php 1:1.
   Paul alone, save Jesus in Mt 6:24; Lu 16:13, uses [douleuO] six times
   for serving God (Page). With all lowliness of mind [meta pases
   tapeinophrosunes]. Lightfoot notes that heathen writers use this word
   for a grovelling, abject state of mind, but Paul follows Christ in
   using it for humility, humble-mindedness that should mark every
   Christian and in particular the preacher. With tears [dakruOn].
   Construed with [meta]. Paul was a man of the deepest emotion along with
   his high intellectuality. He mentions his tears again in verse 31,
   tears of sorrow and of anxiety. He refers to his tears in writing the
   sharp letter to the church in Corinth (2Co 2:4) and in denouncing the
   sensual apostates in Php 3:18. Adolphe Monod has a wonderful sermon on
   the tears of Paul. Consider also the tears of Jesus. Trials which
   befell me [peirasmOn tOn sumbantOn moi]. Construed also with [meta].
   Second aorist active participle of [sunbainO], to walk with, to go
   with, to come together, to happen, to befall. Very common in this sense
   in the old Greek (cf. Ac 3:10). By the plots of the Jews [en tais
   epiboulais tOn IoudaiOn]. Like the plot [epiboule] against him in
   Corinth (20:3) as well as the earlier trial before Gallio and the
   attacks in Thessalonica. In Ac 19:9 Luke shows the hostile attitude of
   the Jews in Ephesus that drove Paul out of the synagogue to the school
   of Tyrannus. He does not describe in detail these "plots" which may
   easily be imagined from Paul's own letters and may be even referred to
   in 1Co 4:10; 15:30ff.; 16:9; 2Co 1:4-10; 7:5; 11:23. In fact, one has
   only to dwell on the allusions in 2Co 11 to picture what Paul's life
   was in Ephesus during these three years. Luke gives in Ac 19 the
   outbreak of Demetrius, but Paul had already fought with "wild-beasts"
   there.

   20:20 How that I shrank not [hOs ouden hupesteilamen]. Still indirect
   discourse (question) after [epistasthe] (ye know) with [hOs] like [pOs]
   in verse 18. First aorist middle of [hupostellO], old verb to draw
   under or back. It was so used of drawing back or down sails on a ship
   and, as Paul had so recently been on the sea, that may be the metaphor
   here. But it is not necessarily so as the direct middle here makes good
   sense and is frequent, to withdraw oneself, to cower, to shrink, to
   conceal, to dissemble as in Hab 2:4 (Heb 10:38). Demosthenes so used it
   to shrink from declaring out of fear for others. This open candour of
   Paul is supported by his Epistles (1Th 2:4, 11; 2Co 4:2; Ga 1:10). From
   declaring unto you [tou me anaggeilai humin]. Ablative case of the
   articular first aorist active infinitive of [anaggellO] with the
   redundant negative after verbs of hindering, etc. (Robertson, Grammar,
   p. 1094). Anything that was profitable [tOn sumpherontOn]. Partitive
   genitive after [ouden] of the articular present active participle of
   [sumpherO], to bear together, be profitable. Publicly [demosiai],
   adverb) and from house to house [kai kat' oikous]. By (according to)
   houses. It is worth noting that this greatest of preachers preached
   from house to house and did not make his visits merely social calls. He
   was doing kingdom business all the while as in the house of Aquila and
   Priscilla (1Co 16:19).

   20:21 Testifying [diamarturomenos]. As Peter did (Ac 2:40) where Luke
   uses this same word thoroughly Lucan and Pauline. So again in verses
   23, 24. Paul here as in Ro 1:16 includes both Jews and Greeks, to the
   Jew first. Repentance toward God [ten eis theon metanoian] and faith
   toward our Lord Jesus [kai pistin eis ton kurion hemOn Iesoun]. These
   two elements run through the Epistle to the Romans which Paul had
   recently written and sent from Corinth. These two elements appear in
   all Paul's preaching whether "to Jews or Gentiles, to philosophers at
   Athens or to peasants at Lystra, he preached repentance toward God and
   faith toward the Lord Jesus" (Knowling).

   20:22 Bound in the spirit [dedemenos tOi pneumati]. Perfect passive
   participle of [deO], to bind, with the locative case. "Bound in my
   spirit" he means, as in 19:21, from a high sense of duty. The mention
   of "the Holy Spirit" specifically in verse 23 seems to be in contrast
   to his own spirit here. His own spirit was under the control of the
   Holy Spirit (Ro 8:16) and the sense does not differ greatly. Not
   knowing [me eidOs]. Second perfect active participle of [oida] with
   [me]. That shall befall me [ta sunantesonta emoi]. Articular future
   active participle of [sunantaO], to meet with (Ac 10:25), to befall
   (with associative instrumental case) and compare with [sumbantOn]
   (befell) in verse 19. One of the rare instances of the future
   participle in the N.T.

   20:23 Save that [plen hoti]. The [hoti] clause is really in the
   ablative case after [plen], here a preposition as in Php 1:18, this
   idiom [plen hoti] occasionally in ancient Greek. In every city [kata
   polin]. Singular here though plural in [kat' oikous] (verse 20). Bonds
   and afflictions [desma kai thlipseis]. Both together as in Php 1:17;
   2Co 1:8. Literal bonds and actual pressures. Abide me [me menousin].
   With the accusative as in verse 5 [emenon hemas] and nowhere else in
   the N.T.

   20:24 But I hold not my life of any account [all' oudenos logou
   poioumai ten psuchen]. Neat Greek idiom, accusative [psuchen] and
   genitive [logou] and then Paul adds "dear unto myself" [timian emautOi]
   in apposition with [psuchen] (really a combination of two
   constructions). So that I may accomplish my course [hOs teleiOsO dromon
   mou]. Rather, "In order that" (purpose, not result). Aleph and B read
   [teleiOsO] here (first aorist active subjunctive) rather than
   [teleiOsai] (first aorist active infinitive). It is the lone instance
   in the N.T. of [hOs] as a final particle (Robertson, Grammar, p. 987).
   Paul in Ac 13:25 in his sermon at Antioch in Pisidia described John as
   fulfilling his course and in 2Ti 4:7 he will say: "I have finished my
   course" [ton dromon teteleka]. He will run the race to the end. Which I
   received from the Lord Jesus [hen elabon para tou kuriou Iesou]. Of
   that fact he never had a doubt and it was a proud boast (Gal 1:1; Ro
   11:13). The gospel of the grace of God [to euaggelion tes charitos tou
   theou]. To Paul the gospel consisted in the grace of God. See this word
   "grace" [charis] in Romans and his other Epistles.

   20:25 And now, behold [kai nun, idou]. Second time and solemn reminder
   as in verse 22. I know [egO oida]. Emphasis on [egO] which is
   expressed. Ye all [humeis pantes]. In very emphatic position after the
   verb [opsesthe] (shall see) and the object (my face). Twice Paul will
   write from Rome (Php 2:24; Phm 1:22) the hope of coming east again; but
   that is in the future, and here Paul is expressing his personal
   conviction and his fears. The Pastoral Epistles show Paul did come to
   Ephesus again (1Ti 1:3; 3:14; 4:13) and Troas (2Ti 4:13) and Miletus
   (2Ti 4:20). There need be no surprise that Paul's fears turned out
   otherwise. He had reason enough for them. Among whom I went about [en
   hois dielthon]. Apparently Paul here has in mind others beside the
   ministers. They represented the church in Ephesus and the whole region
   where Paul laboured.

   20:26 I testify [marturomai]. Elsewhere in the N.T. only in Paul's
   Epistles (Ga 5:3; Eph 4:17; 1Th 2:12). It means "I call to witness"
   while [martureO] means "I bear witness." This day [en tei semeron
   hemerai]. The today day, the last day with you, our parting day. I am
   pure from the blood of all men [katharos eimi apo tou haimatos pantOn].
   Paul was sensitive on this point as in Corinth (Ac 18:6). It is much
   for any preacher to claim and it ought to be true of all. The papyri
   also give this use of [apo] with the ablative rather than the mere
   ablative after [katharos].

   20:27 Paul here repeats the very words and idioms used in verse 20,
   adding "the whole counsel of God" [pasan ten boulen tou theou]. All the
   counsel of God that concerned Paul's work and nothing inconsistent with
   the purpose of God of redemption through Christ Jesus (Page).

   20:28 Take heed unto yourselves [prosechete heautois]. The full phrase
   had [ton noun], hold your mind on yourselves (or other object in the
   dative), as often in old writers and in Job 7:17. But the ancients
   often used the idiom with [noun] understood, but not expressed as here
   and Ac 5:35; Lu 12:1; 17:3; 21:34; 1Ti 1:4; 3:8; 4:13. [Epeche] is so
   used in 1Ti 4:16. To all the flock [panti tOi poimniOi]. Contracted
   form of [poimenion = poimne] (Joh 10:16) already in Lu 12:32 and also
   in Ac 20:29; 1Pe 5:2, 3. Common in old Greek. Hath made [etheto]. Did
   make, second aorist middle indicative of [tithemi], did appoint. Paul
   evidently believed that the Holy Spirit calls and appoints ministers.
   Bishops [episkopous]. The same men termed elders in verse 17 which see.
   To shepherd [poimainein]. Present active infinitive of purpose of
   [poimainO], old verb to feed or tend the flock [poimne, poimnion], to
   act as shepherd [poimen]. These ministers are thus in Paul's speech
   called elders (verse 17), bishops ( verse 28), and shepherds (verse
   28). Jesus had used this very word to Peter (Joh 21:16, twice [boske],
   feed, 21:15, 17) and Peter will use it in addressing fellow-elders (1Pe
   5:2) with memories, no doubt of the words of Jesus to him. The "elders"
   were to watch over as "bishops" and "tend and feed as shepherds" the
   flock. Jesus is termed "the shepherd and bishop of your souls" in 1Pe
   2:25 and "the great Shepherd of the sheep" in Heb 13:20. Jesus called
   himself "the good Shepherd" in Joh 10:11. The church of God [ten
   ekklesian tou theou]. The correct text, not "the church of the Lord" or
   "the church of the Lord and God" (Robertson, Introduction to Textual
   Criticism of the N.T., p. 189). He purchased [periepoiesato]. First
   aorist middle of [peripoieO], old verb to reserve, to preserve (for or
   by oneself, in the middle). In the N.T. only in Luke 17:33; Ac 20:28;
   1Ti 3:13. The substantive [peripoiesin] (preservation, possession)
   occurs in 1Pe 2:9 ("a peculiar people" = a people for a possession) and
   in Eph 1:14. With his own blood [dia tou haimatos tou idiou]. Through
   the agency of [dia] his own blood. Whose blood? If [tou theou] (Aleph B
   Vulg.) is correct, as it is, then Jesus is here called "God" who shed
   his own blood for the flock. It will not do to say that Paul did not
   call Jesus God, for we have Ro 9:5; Col 2:9; Tit 2:13 where he does
   that very thing, besides Col 1:15-20; Php 2:5-11.

   20:29 After my departing [meta ten aphixin mou]. Not his death, but his
   departure from them. From [aphikneomai] and usually meant arrival, but
   departure in Herodotus IX. 17, 76 as here. Grievous wolves [lukoi
   bareis]. [Bareis] is heavy, rapacious, harsh. Jesus had already so
   described false teachers who would raven the fold (Joh 10:12). Whether
   Paul had in mind the Judaizers who had given him so much trouble in
   Antioch, Jerusalem, Galatia, Corinth or the Gnostics the shadow of
   whose coming he already foresaw is not perfectly clear. But it will not
   be many years before Epaphras will come to Rome from Colossae with news
   of the new peril there (Epistle to the Colossians). In writing to
   Timothy (1Ti 1:20) Paul will warn him against some who have already
   made shipwreck of their faith. In Re 2:2 John will represent Jesus as
   describing false apostles in Ephesus. Not sparing the flock [me
   pheidomenoi tou poimniou]. Litotes again as so often in Acts. Sparing
   the flock was not the fashion of wolves. Jesus sent the seventy as
   lambs in the midst of wolves (Lu 10:3). In the Sermon on the Mount
   Jesus had pictured the false prophets who would come as ravening wolves
   in sheep's clothing (Mt 7:15).

   20:30 From among your own selves [ex humOn autOn]. In sheep's clothing
   just as Jesus had foretold. The outcome fully justified Paul's
   apprehensions as we see in Colossians, Ephesians, I and II Timothy,
   Revelation. False philosophy, immorality, asceticism will lead some
   astray (Col 2:8, 18; Eph 4:14; 5:6). John will picture "antichrists"
   who went out from us because they were not of us (1Jo 2:18f.). There is
   a false optimism that is complacently blind as well as a despondent
   pessimism that gives up the fight. Perverse things [diestrammena].
   Perfect passive participle of [diastrephO], old verb to turn aside,
   twist, distort as in Ac 13:8, 10. To draw away [tou apospain].
   Articular genitive present active participle of purpose from [apospaO],
   old verb used to draw the sword (Mt 26:51), to separate (Lu 22:41; Ac
   21:1). The pity of it is that such leaders of dissension can always
   gain a certain following. Paul's long residence in Ephesus enabled him
   to judge clearly of conditions there.

   20:31 Wherefore watch ye [dio gregoreite]. Paul has concluded his
   defence of himself and his warning. Now he exhorts on the basis of it
   [dio] because of which thing. The very command of Jesus concerning the
   perils before his return as in Mr 13:35 [gregoreite], the very form
   (late present imperative from the second perfect [egregora] of
   [egeirO], to arouse). Stay awake. I ceased not to admonish [ouk
   epausamen nouthetOn]. Participle describes Paul, I did not cease
   admonishing, night and day [nukta kai hemeran], accusative of extent of
   time, for three years [trietian], accusative of extent of time also).
   [NouthetOn] is from [noutheteO], to put sense into one. So Paul kept it
   up with tears (verse 19) if so be he could save the Ephesians from the
   impending perils. Forewarned is to be forearmed. Paul did his duty by
   them.

   20:32 And now [kai ta nun]. Same phrase as in verses 22, 25 save that
   [idou] (behold) is wanting and the article [ta] occurs before [nun],
   accusative of general reference. And as to the present things (or
   situation) as in 4:29. I commend [paratithemai]. Present middle
   indicative of [paratithemi], old verb to place beside, middle, to
   deposit with one, to interest as in 1Ti 1:18; 2Ti 2:2. Paul can now
   only do this, but he does it hopefully. Cf. 1Pe 4:19. The word of his
   grace [tOi logOi tes charitos autou]. The instrumentality through
   preaching and the Holy Spirit employed by God. Cf. Col 4:6; Eph 4:29.
   Which is able to build up [tOi dunamenOi oikodomesai]. God works
   through the word of his grace and so it is able to build up (edify); a
   favourite Pauline word (1Co 3:10-14; 3:9; 2Co 5:1; Eph 2:20-22; 2Ti
   3:15; etc.), and Jas 1:21. The very words "build" and "inheritance
   among the sanctified" will occur in Eph 1:11; 2:30; 3:18 and which some
   may recall on reading. Cf. Col 1:12. Stephen in Ac 7:5 used the word
   "inheritance" [kleronomian], nowhere else in Acts, but in Eph 1:14, 18;
   5:5. In Eph 1:18 the very expression occurs "his inheritance among the
   saints " [ten kleronomian autou en tois hagiois].

   20:33 No man's silver or gold or apparel [arguriou e chrusiou e
   himatismou oudenos]. Genitive case after [epethumesa]. One of the
   slanders against Paul was that he was raising this collection,
   ostensibly for the poor, really for himself (2Co 12:17f.). He includes
   "apparel" because oriental wealth consisted largely in fine apparel
   (not old worn out clothes). See Ge 24:53; 2Ki 5:5; Ps 45:13f.; Mt 6:19.
   Paul did not preach just for money.

   20:34 Ye yourselves [autoi]. Intensive pronoun. Certainly they knew
   that the church in Ephesus had not supported Paul while there. These
   hands [hai cheires hautai]. Paul was not above manual labour. He
   pointed to his hands with pride as proof that he toiled at his trade of
   tent-making as at Thessalonica and Corinth for his own needs [chreiais]
   and for those with him (probably Aquila and Priscilla) with whom he
   lived and probably Timothy because of his often infirmities (1Ti 5:23).
   Ministered [huperetesan]. First aorist active of [hupereteO], to act as
   under rower, old verb, but in the N.T. only in Ac 13:36; 20:34; 24:23.
   While in Ephesus Paul wrote to Corinth: "We toil, working with our own
   hands" (1Co 4:12). "As he held them up, they saw a tongue of truth in
   every seam that marked them" (Furneaux).

   20:35 I gave you an example [hupedeixa]. First aorist active indicative
   of [hupodeiknumi], old verb to show under one's eyes, to give object
   lesson, by deed as well as by word (Lu 6:47). [Hupodeigma] means
   example (Joh 13:15; Jas 5:10). So Paul appeals to his example in 1Co
   11:1; Php 3:17. [Panta] is accusative plural of general reference (in
   all things). So labouring ye ought to help [houtOs kopiOntas dei
   antilambanesthai]. So, as I did. Necessity [dei]. Toiling [kopiOntas]
   not just for ourselves, but to help [antilambanesthai], to take hold
   yourselves (middle voice) at the other end [anti]. This verb common in
   the old Greek, but in the N.T. only in Lu 1:54; Ac 20:35; 1Ti 6:2. This
   noble plea to help the weak is the very spirit of Christ (1Th 5:14; 1Co
   12:28; Ro 5:6; 14:1). In 1Th 5:14 [antechesthe tOn asthenountOn] we
   have Paul's very idea again. Every Community Chest appeal today
   re-echoes Paul's plea. He himself said [autos eipen]. Not in the
   Gospels, one of the sayings of Jesus in current use that Paul had
   received and treasured. Various other Agrapha of Jesus have been
   preserved in ancient writers and some in recently discovered papyri
   which may be genuine or not. We are grateful that Paul treasured this
   one. This Beatitude (on [makarion] see on Mt 5:3-11) is illustrated by
   the whole life of Jesus with the Cross as the culmination. Aristotle
   (Eth. IV. I) has a saying somewhat like this, but assigns the feeling
   of superiority as the reason (Page), an utterly different idea from
   that here. This quotation raises the question of how much Paul
   personally knew of the life and sayings of Jesus.

   20:36 He kneeled down [theis ta gonata autou]. Second aorist active
   participle of [tithemi], to place. The very idiom used in 7:60 of
   Stephen. Not in ancient writers and only six times in the N.T. (Mr
   15:19; Lu 22:41; Ac 7:60; 9:40; 20:36; 21:5). Certainly kneeling in
   prayer is a fitting attitude (cf. Jesus, Lu 22:41), though not the only
   proper one (Mt 6:5). Paul apparently prayed aloud [proseuxato].

   20:37 They all wept sore [hikanos klauthmos egeneto pantOn]. Literally,
   There came considerable weeping of all (on the part of all, genitive
   case). Kissed him [katephiloun auton]. Imperfect active of
   [kataphileO], old verb, intensive with [kata] and repetition shown also
   by the tense: They kept on kissing or kissed repeatedly, probably one
   after the other falling on his neck. Cf. also Mt 26:49.

   20:38 Sorrowing [odunOmenoi]. Present middle participle of [odunaO],
   old verb to cause intense pain, to torment (Lu 16:24), middle to
   distress oneself (Lu 2:48; Ac 20:38). Nowhere else in N.T. Which he had
   spoken [hOi eirekei]. Relative attracted to the case of the antecedent
   [logOi] (word). Past perfect indicative of [eipon]. They brought him on
   his way [proepempon auton]. Imperfect active of [propempO], old verb to
   send forward, to accompany as in Ac 15:3; 20:38; 21:5; 1Co 16:6,11; 2Co
   1:16; Tit 3:13; 3Jo 1:6. Graphic picture of Paul's departure from this
   group of ministers.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 21

   21:1 Were parted from them [apospasthentas ap' autOn]. First aorist
   passive participle of [apospaO] same verb as in 20:30; Lu 22:41. Had
   set sail [anachthenai]. First aorist passive of [anagO], the usual verb
   to put out (up) to sea as in verse 2 [anechthemen]. We came with a
   straight course [euthudromesantes elthomen]. The same verb (aorist
   active participle of [euthudromeO] used by Luke in 16:11 of the voyage
   from Troas to Samothrace and Neapolis, which see. Unto Cos [eis ten
   Ko]. Standing today, about forty nautical miles south from Miletus,
   island famous as the birthplace of Hippocrates and Apelles with a great
   medical school. Great trading place with many Jews. The next day [tei
   hexes]. Locative case with [hemerai] (day) understood. The adverb
   [hexes] is from [echO] (future [hexO] and means successively or in
   order. This is another one of Luke's ways of saying "on the next day"
   (cf. three others in 20:15). Unto Rhodes [eis ten Rhodon]. Called the
   island of roses. The sun shone most days and made roses luxuriant. The
   great colossus which represented the sun, one of the seven wonders of
   the world, was prostrate at this time. The island was at the entrance
   to the Aegean Sea and had a great university, especially for rhetoric
   and oratory. There was great commerce also. Unto Patara [eis Patara]. A
   seaport on the Lycian coast on the left bank of the Xanthus. It once
   had an oracle of Apollo which rivalled that at Delphi. This was the
   course taken by hundreds of ships every season.

   21:2 Having found a ship [heurontes ploion]. Paul had used a small
   coasting vessel (probably hired) that anchored each night at Cos,
   Rhodes, Patara. He was still some four hundred miles from Jerusalem.
   But at Patara Paul caught a large vessel (a merchantman) that could
   sail across the open sea. Crossing over unto Phoenicia [diaperOn eis
   Phoiniken]. Neuter singular accusative (agreeing with [ploion] present
   active participle of [diaperaO], old verb to go between [dia] and so
   across to Tyre. We went aboard [epibantes]. Second aorist active
   participle of [epibainO].

   21:3 When we had come in sight of Cyprus [anaphanantes ten Kupron].
   First aorist active participle of [anaphainO] (Doric form [-phanantes]
   rather than the Attic [-phenantes], old verb to make appear, bring to
   light, to manifest. Having made Cyprus visible or rise up out of the
   sea. Nautical terms. In the N.T. only here and Lu 19:11 which see. On
   the left hand [euOnumon]. Compound feminine adjective like masculine.
   They sailed south of Cyprus. We sailed [epleomen]. Imperfect active of
   common verb [pleO], kept on sailing till we came to Syria. Landed at
   Tyre [katelthomen eis Turon]. Came down to Tyre. Then a free city of
   Syria in honour of its former greatness (cf. the long siege by
   Alexander the Great). There [ekeise]. Thither, literally. Only one
   other instance in N.T., 22:5 which may be pertinent = [ekei] (there).
   Was to unlade [en apophortizomenon]. Periphrastic imperfect middle of
   [apophortizO], late verb from [apo] and [phortos], load, but here only
   in the N.T. Literally, "For thither the boat was unloading her cargo,"
   a sort of "customary" or "progressive" imperfect (Robertson, Grammar,
   p. 884). Burden [gomon]. Cargo, old word, from [gemO], to be full. Only
   here and Re 18:11f. in N.T. Probably a grain or fruit ship. It took
   seven days here to unload and reload.

   21:4 Having found [aneurontes]. Second aorist active participle of
   [aneuriskO], to seek for, to find by searching [ana]. There was a
   church here, but it was a large city and the number of members may not
   have been large. Probably some of those that fled from Jerusalem who
   came to Phoenicia (Ac 11:19) started the work here. Paul went also
   through Phoenicia on the way to the Jerusalem Conference (15:3). As at
   Troas and Miletus, so here Paul's indefatigible energy shows itself
   with characteristic zeal. Through the Spirit [dia tou pneumatos]. The
   Holy Spirit undoubtedly who had already told Paul that bonds and
   afflictions awaited him in Jerusalem (20:23). That he should not set
   foot in Jerusalem [me epibainein eis Ierosoluma]. Indirect command with
   [me] and the present active infinitive, not to keep on going to
   Jerusalem (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1046). In spite of this warning Paul
   felt it his duty as before (20:22) to go on. Evidently Paul interpreted
   the action of the Holy Spirit as information and warning although the
   disciples at Tyre gave it the form of a prohibition. Duty called louder
   than warning to Paul even if both were the calls of God.

   21:5 That we had accomplished the days [exartisai hemas tas hemeras].
   First aorist active infinitive of [exartizO], to furnish perfectly,
   rare in ancient writers, but fairly frequent in the papyri. Only twice
   in the N.T., here and 2Ti 3:17. Finish the exact number of days (seven)
   of verse 4. The accusative of general reference [hemas] is the usual
   construction and the infinitive clause is the subject of [egeneto]. We
   departed and went on our journey [exelthontes eporeuometha]. Sharp
   distinction between the first aorist active participle [exelthontes]
   (from [exerchomai], to go out) and the imperfect middle [eporeuometha]
   from [poreuO] (we were going on). And they all, with wives and
   children, brought us on our way [propempontOn hemas pantOn sun gunaixi
   kai teknois]. No "and" in the Greek, simply genitive absolute, "They
   all with wives and children accompanying us," just as at Miletus
   (20:28), same verb [propempO] which see. The first mention of children
   in connection with the apostolic churches (Vincent). Vivid picture here
   as at Miletus, evident touch of an eyewitness. Till we were out of the
   city [heOs exO tes poleOs]. Note both adverbial prepositions [heOs exO]
   clear outside of the city.

   21:6 Beach [aigialon]. As in Mt 13:2 which see. This scene is in public
   as at Miletus, but they did not care. Bade each other farewell
   [apespasametha allelous]. First aorist middle of [apaspazomai]. Rare
   compound, here alone in the N.T. Tender scene, but "no bonds of long
   comradeship, none of the clinging love" (Furneaux) seen at Miletus (Ac
   20:37f.). Home again [eis ta idia]. To their own places as of the
   Beloved Disciple in Joh 19:27 and of Jesus in Joh 1:11. This idiom in
   the papyri also.

   21:7 Had finished [dianusantes]. First aorist active participle of
   [dianuO], old verb to accomplish [anuO] thoroughly [dia], only here in
   the N.T. From Tyre [apo Turou]. Page takes (Hackett also) with
   [katentesamen] (we arrived) rather than with "[ton ploun]" (the voyage)
   and with good reason: "And we, having (thereby) finished the voyage,
   arrived from Tyre at Ptolemais." Ptolemais is the modern Acre, called
   Accho in Jud 1:31. The harbour is the best on the coast of Palestine
   and is surrounded by mountains. It is about thirty miles south of Tyre.
   It was never taken by Israel and was considered a Philistine town and
   the Greeks counted it a Phoenician city. It was the key to the road
   down the coast between Syria and Egypt and had successively the rule of
   the Ptolemies, Syrians, Romans. Saluted [aspasamenoi]. Here greeting as
   in 21:19 rather than farewell as in 20:1. The stay was short, one day
   [hemeran mian], accusative), but "the brethren" Paul and his party
   found easily. Possibly the scattered brethren (Ac 11:19) founded the
   church here or Philip may have done it.

   21:8 On the morrow [tei epaurion]. Another and the more common way of
   expressing this idea of "next day" besides the three in 20:15 and the
   one in 21:1. Unto Caesarea [eis Kaisarian]. Apparently by land as the
   voyage [ploun] ended at Ptolemais (verse 7). Caesarea is the political
   capital of Judea under the Romans where the procurators lived and a
   city of importance, built by Herod the Great and named in honour of
   Augustus. It had a magnificent harbour built Most of the inhabitants
   were Greeks. This is the third time that we have seen Paul in Caesarea,
   on his journey from Jerusalem to Tarsus (Ac 9:30), on his return from
   Antioch at the close of the second mission tour (18:22) and now. The
   best MSS. omit [hoi peri Paulou] (we that were of Paul's company) a
   phrase like that in 13:13. Into the house of Philip the evangelist [eis
   ton oikon Philippou tou euaggelistou]. Second in the list of the seven
   (6:5) after Stephen and that fact mentioned here. By this title he is
   distinguished from "Philip the apostle," one of the twelve. His
   evangelistic work followed the death of Stephen (Ac 8) in Samaria,
   Philistia, with his home in Caesarea. The word "evangelizing"
   [eueggelizeto] was used of him in 8:40. The earliest of the three N.T.
   examples of the word "evangelist" (Ac 21:8; Eph 4:11; 2Ti 4:5).
   Apparently a word used to describe one who told the gospel story as
   Philip did and may have been used of him first of all as John was
   termed "the baptizer" [ho baptizOn], Mr 1:4), then "the Baptist" [ho
   baptistes], Mt 3:1). It is found on an inscription in one of the Greek
   islands of uncertain date and was used in ecclesiastical writers of
   later times on the Four Gospels as we do. As used here the meaning is a
   travelling missionary who "gospelized" communities. This is probably
   Paul's idea in 2Ti 4:5. In Eph 4:11 the word seems to describe a
   special class of ministers just as we have them today. Men have
   different gifts and Philip had this of evangelizing as Paul was doing
   who is the chief evangelist. The ideal minister today combines the
   gifts of evangelist, herald, teacher, shepherd. "We abode with him"
   [emeinamen par' autOi]. Constative aorist active indicative. [Par
   autOi] (by his side) is a neat idiom for "at his house." What a joyful
   time Paul had in conversation with Philip. He could learn from him much
   of value about the early days of the gospel in Jerusalem. And Luke
   could, and probably did, take notes from Philip and his daughters about
   the beginnings of Christian history. It is generally supposed that the
   "we" sections of Acts represent a travel document by Luke (notes made
   by him as he journeyed from Troas to Rome). Those who deny the Lukan
   authorship of the whole book usually admit this. So we may suppose that
   Luke is already gathering data for future use. If so, these were
   precious days for him.

   21:9 Virgins which did prophesy [parthenoi propheteusai]. Not
   necessarily an "order" of virgins, but Philip had the honour of having
   in his home four virgin daughters with the gift of prophecy which was
   not necessarily predicting events, though that was done as by Agabus
   here. It was more than ordinary preaching (cf. 19:6) and was put by
   Paul above the other gifts like tongues (1Co 14:1-33). The prophecy of
   Joel (2:28f.) about their sons and daughters prophesying is quoted by
   Peter and applied to the events on the day of Pentecost (Ac 2:17). Paul
   in 1Co 11:5 gives directions about praying and prophesying by the women
   (apparently in public worship) with the head uncovered and sharply
   requires the head covering, though not forbidding the praying and
   prophesying. With this must be compared his demand for silence by the
   women in 1Co 14:34-40; 1Ti 2:8-15 which it is not easy to reconcile.
   One wonders if there was not something known to Paul about special
   conditions in Corinth and Ephesus that he has not told. There was also
   Anna the prophetess in the temple (Lu 2:36) besides the inspired hymns
   of Elizabeth (Lu 1:42-45) and of Mary (Lu 1:46-55). At any rate there
   was no order of women prophets or official ministers. There were Old
   Testament prophetesses like Miriam, Deborah, Huldah. Today in our
   Sunday schools the women do most of the actual teaching. The whole
   problem is difficult and calls for restraint and reverence. One thing
   is certain and that is that Luke appreciated the services of women for
   Christ as is shown often in his writings (Lu 8:1-3, for instance)
   before this incident.

   21:10 As we tarried [epimenontOn hemOn]. Genitive absolute. Note [epi]
   (additional) with [menO] as in 12:16. Many days [hemeras pleious]. More
   days (than we expected), accusative of time. A certain prophet named
   Agabus [prophetes onomati Agabos]. A prophet like the daughters of
   Philip, mentioned already in connection with the famine predicted by
   him (Ac 11:28), but apparently not a man of prominence like Barnabas,
   and so no allusion to that former prophecy.

   21:11 Coming [elthOn], second aorist active participle of [erchomai],
   taking [aras], first aorist active participle of [airO], to take up),
   binding [desas], first aorist active participle of [deO], to bind).
   Vivid use of three successive participles describing the dramatic
   action of Agabus. Paul's girdle [ten zOnen tou Paulou]. Old word from
   [zOnnumi], to gird. See on 12:8. His own feet and hands [heautou tous
   podas kai tas cheiras]. Basis for the interpretation. Old Testament
   prophets often employed symbolic deeds (1Ki 22:11; Jas 2:2; Jer 13:1-7;
   Eze 4:1-6). Jesus interpreted the symbolism of Peter's girding himself
   (Joh 21:18). So [houtOs]. As Agabus had bound himself. Agabus was just
   from Jerusalem and probably knew the feeling there against Paul. At any
   rate the Holy Spirit revealed it to him as he claims. Shall deliver
   [paradOsousin]. Like the words of Jesus about himself (Mt 20:19). He
   was "delivered" into the hands of the Gentiles and it took five years
   to get out of those hands.

   21:12 Both we and they of that place [hemeis te kai hoi entopioi].
   Usual use of [te kai] (both--and). [Entopioi], old word, only here in
   N.T. Not to go up [tou me anabainein]. Probably ablative of the
   articular present active infinitive with redundant negative [me] after
   [parekaloumen] (imperfect active, conative). We tried to persuade him
   from going up. It can be explained as genitive, but not so likely: We
   tried to persuade him in respect to not going up. Vincent cites the
   case of Regulus who insisted on returning from Rome to Carthage to
   certain death and that of Luther on the way to the Diet of Worms.
   Spalatin begged Luther not to go on. Luther said: "Though devils be as
   many in Worms as tiles upon the roofs, yet thither will I go." This
   dramatic warning of Agabus came on top of that in Tyre (21:4) and
   Paul's own confession in Miletus (20:23). It is small wonder that Luke
   and the other messengers together with Philip and his daughters
   (prophetesses versus prophet?) joined in a chorus of dissuasion to
   Paul.

   21:13 What are you doing weeping? [Ti poieite klaiontes?] Strong
   protest as in Mr 11:5. Breaking my heart [sunthruptontes mou ten
   kardian]. The verb [sunthruptO], to crush together, is late Koine for
   [apothruptO], to break off, both vivid and expressive words. So to
   enervate and unman one, weakening Paul's determination to go on with
   his duty. I am ready [EgO hetoimOs echO]. I hold (myself) in readiness
   (adverb, [hetoimOs]. Same idiom in 2Co 12:14. Not only to be bound [ou
   monon dethenai]. First aorist passive infinitive of [deO] and note [ou
   monon] rather than [me monon], the usual negative of the infinitive
   because of the sharp contrast (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1095). Paul's
   readiness to die, if need be, at Jerusalem is like that of Jesus on the
   way to Jerusalem the last time. Even before that Luke (9:51) said that
   "he set his face to go on to Jerusalem." Later the disciples will say
   to Jesus, "Master, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and
   goest thou thither?" (Joh 11:8). The stature of Paul rises here to
   heroic proportions "for the name of the Lord Jesus" [huper tou onomatos
   tou kuriou Iesou].

   21:14 When he would not be persuaded [me peithomenou autou]. Genitive
   absolute of the present passive participle of [peithO]. Literally, "he
   not being persuaded." That was all. Paul's will [kardia] was not
   broken, not even bent. We ceased [hesuchasamen]. Ingressive aorist
   active indicative of [hesuchazO], old verb to be quiet, silent. The
   will of the Lord be done [tou kuriou to thelema ginesthO]. Present
   middle imperative of [ginomai]. There is a quaint naivete in this
   confession by the friends of Paul. Since Paul would not let them have
   their way, they were willing for the Lord to have his way, acquiescence
   after failure to have theirs.

   21:15 We took up our baggage [episkeuasamenoi]. First aorist middle
   participle of [episkeuazO], old verb to furnish [skeuos, epi] with
   things necessary, to pack up, saddle horses here Ramsay holds. Here
   only in the N.T. Went up [anebainomen]. Inchoative imperfect active of
   [anabainO], we started to go up.

   21:16 Certain of the disciples [tOn mathetOn]. The genitive here occurs
   with [tines] understood as often in the Greek idiom, the partitive
   genitive used as nominative (Robertson, Grammar, p. 502). Bringing
   [agontes]. Nominative plural participle agreeing with [tines]
   understood, not with case of [mathetOn]. One Mnason of Cyprus, an early
   disciple, with whom we should lodge [par hOi xenisthOmen MnasOni tini
   KupriOi archaiOi mathetei]. A thoroughly idiomatic Greek idiom,
   incorporation and attraction of the antecedent into the relative clause
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 718). [MnasOni] is really the object of
   [agontes] or the accusative with [para] or [pros] understood and should
   be accusative, but it is placed in the clause after the relative and in
   the same locative case with the relative [hOi] (due to [par'], beside,
   with). Then the rest agrees in case with [MnasOni]. He was originally
   from Cyprus, but now in Caesarea. The Codex Bezae adds [eis tina kOmen]
   (to a certain village) and makes it mean that they were to lodge with
   Mnason at his home there about halfway to Jerusalem. This may be true.
   The use of the subjunctive [xenisthOmen] (first aorist passive of
   [xenizO], to entertain strangers as in Ac 10:6, 23, 32 already) may be
   volitive of purpose with the relative (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 955,
   989). The use of [archaiOi] for "early" may refer to the fact that he
   was one of the original disciples at Pentecost as Peter in 15:7 uses
   [hemerOn archaiOn] (early days) to refer to his experience at Ceasarea
   in Ac 10. "As the number of the first disciples lessened, the next
   generation accorded a sort of honour to the survivors" (Furneaux).

   21:17 When we were come [genomenOn hemOn]. Genitive absolute again, "we
   having come." Received [apedexanto]. [Apodechomai], to receive from.
   This old compound only in Luke in the N.T. Gladly [asmenOs]. Old adverb
   [hesmenOs] from [hedomai], to be pleased. Here only in the N.T. Perhaps
   this first glad welcome was from Paul's personal friends in Jerusalem.

   21:18 The day following [tei epiousei]. As in 20:15 which see. Went in
   [eiseiei]. Imperfect active of [eiseimi], old classic verb used only
   four times in the N.T. (Ac 3:3; 21:18,26; Heb 9:6), a mark of the
   literary style rather than the colloquial Koine use of [eiserchomai].
   Together with us to James [sun hemin pros IakObon]. So then Luke is
   present. The next use of "we" is in 27:1 when they leave Caesarea for
   Rome, but it is not likely that Luke was away from Paul in Jerusalem
   and Caesarea. The reports of what was done and said in both places is
   so full and minute that it seems reasonable that Luke got first hand
   information here whatever his motive was for so full an account of
   these legal proceedings to be discussed later. There are many details
   that read like an eye witness's story (21:30, 35, 40; 22:2, 3; 23:12,
   etc.). It was probably the house of James [pros] and [para] so used
   often). And all the elders were present [pantes te paregenonto hoi
   presbuteroi]. Clearly James is the leading elder and the others are his
   guests in a formal reception to Paul. It is noticeable that the
   apostles are not mentioned, though both elders and apostles are named
   at the Conference in chapter 15. It would seem that the apostles are
   away on preaching tours. The whole church was not called together
   probably because of the known prejudice against Paul created by the
   Judaizers.

   21:19 He rehearsed [exegeito]. Imperfect middle of [exegeomai], old
   verb to lead out, to draw out in narrative, to recount. So Paul is
   pictured as taking his time for he had a great story to tell of what
   had happened since they saw him last. One by one [kath' hena hekaston].
   According to each one (item) and the adverbial phrase used as an
   accusative after the verb [exegeito] as Demosthenes does (1265), though
   it could be like [kath' hena hekastos] in Eph 5:33. Which [hOn].
   Genitive attracted from [ha] (accusative) into the case of the
   unexpressed antecedent [toutOn]. God had wrought [epoiesen ho theos].
   Summary constative aorist active indicative that gathers up all that
   God did and he takes pains to give God the glory. It is possible that
   at this formal meeting Paul observed an absence of warmth and
   enthusiasm in contrast with the welcome accorded by his friends the day
   before (verse 17). Furneaux thinks that Paul was coldly received on
   this day in spite of the generous offering brought from the Gentile
   Christians. "It looks as though his misgiving as to its reception (Ro
   15:31) was confirmed. Nor do we hear that the Christians of Jerusalem
   later put in so much as a word on his behalf with either the Jewish or
   the Roman authorities, or expressed any sympathy with him during his
   long imprisonment at Caesarea" (Furneaux). The most that can be said is
   that the Judaizers referred to by James do not appear actively against
   him. The collection and the plan proposed by James accomplished that
   much at any rate. It stopped the mouths of those lions.

   21:20 Glorified [edoxazon]. Inchoative imperfect, began to glorify God,
   though without special praise of Paul. How many thousands [posai
   muriades]. Old word for ten thousand (Ac 19:19) and then an indefinite
   number like our "myriads" (this very word) as Lu 12:1; Ac 21:20; Jude
   1:14; Re 5:11; 9:16. But it is a surprising statement even with
   allowable hyperbole, but one may recall Ac 4:4 (number of the men--not
   women--about five thousand); 5:14 (multitudes both of men and women);
   6:7. There were undoubtedly a great many thousands of believers in
   Jerusalem and all Jewish Christians, some, alas, Judaizers (Ac 11:2;
   15:1,5). This list may include the Christians from neighbouring towns
   in Palestine and even some from foreign countries here at the Feast of
   Pentecost, for it is probable that Paul arrived in time for it as he
   had hoped. But we do not have to count the hostile Jews from Asia
   (verse 27) who were clearly not Christians at all. All zealous for the
   law [pantes zelOtai tou nomou]. Zealots (substantive) rather than
   zealous (adjective) with objective genitive [tou nomou]. The word
   zealot is from [zeloO], to burn with zeal, to boil. The Greek used
   [zelOtes] for an imitator or admirer. There was a party of Zealots
   (developed from the Pharisees), a group of what would be called
   "hot-heads," who brought on the war with Rome. One of this party, Simon
   Zelotes (Ac 1:13), was in the number of the twelve apostles. It is
   important to understand the issues in Jerusalem. It was settled at the
   Jerusalem Conference (Ac 15; Ga 2) that the Mosaic ceremonial law was
   not to be imposed upon Gentile Christians. Paul won freedom for them,
   but it was not said that it was wrong for Jewish Christians to go on
   observing it if they wished. We have seen Paul observing the passover
   in Philippi (Ac 20:6) and planning to reach Jerusalem for Pentecost
   (20:16). The Judaizers rankled under Paul's victory and power in
   spreading the gospel among the Gentiles and gave him great trouble in
   Galatia and Corinth. They were busy against him in Jerusalem also and
   it was to undo the harm done by them in Jerusalem that Paul gathered
   the great collection from the Gentile Christians and brought it with
   him and the delegates from the churches. Clearly then Paul had real
   ground for his apprehension of trouble in Jerusalem while still in
   Corinth (Ro 15:25) when he asked for the prayers of the Roman
   Christians (verses 30-32). The repeated warnings along the way were
   amply justified.

   21:21 They have been informed concerning thee [katechethesan peri sou].
   First aorist passive indicative of [katecheO]. A word in the ancient
   Greek, but a few examples survive in the papyri. It means to sound
   (echo, from [echO], our word) down [kata], to resound, re-echo, to
   teach orally. Oriental students today (Arabs learning the Koran) often
   study aloud. In the N.T. only in Lu 1:4 which see; Ac 18:25; 21:21; 1Co
   14:19; Ga 6:6; Ro 2:18. This oral teaching about Paul was done
   diligently by the Judaizers who had raised trouble against Peter (Ac
   11:2) and Paul (15:1, 5). They had failed in their attacks on Paul's
   world campaigns. Now they try to undermine him at home. In Paul's long
   absence from Jerusalem, since 18:22, they have had a free hand, save
   what opposition James would give, and have had great success in
   prejudicing the Jerusalem Christians against Paul. So James, in the
   presence of the other elders and probably at their suggestion, feels
   called upon to tell Paul the actual situation. That thou teachest all
   the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses [hoti apostasian
   didaskeis apo MOuseOs tous kata ta ethne pantas Ioudaious]. Two
   accusatives with [didaskeis] (verb of teaching) according to rule.
   Literally, "That thou art teaching all the Jews among [kata] the
   Gentiles (the Jews of the dispersion as in 2:9) apostasy from Moses."
   That is the point, the dreadful word [apostasian] (our apostasy), a
   late form (I Macc. 2:15) for the earlier [apostasis] (cf. 2Th 2:3 for
   [apostasia]. "In the eyes of the church at Jerusalem this was a far
   more serious matter than the previous question at the Conference about
   the status of Gentile converts" (Furneaux). Paul had brought that issue
   to the Jerusalem Conference because of the contention of the Judaizers.
   But here it is not the Judaizers, but the elders of the church with
   James as their spokesman on behalf of the church as a whole. They do
   not believe this false charge, but they wish Paul to set it straight.
   Paul had made his position clear in his Epistles (I Corinthians,
   Galatians, Romans) for all who cared to know. Telling them not to
   circumcise their children [legOn me peritemnein autous ta tekna]. The
   participle [legOn] agrees with "thou" (Paul), the subject of
   [didaskeis]. This is not indirect assertion, but indirect command,
   hence the negative [me] instead of [ou] with the infinitive (Robertson,
   Grammar, p.1046). The point is not that Paul stated what the Jewish
   Christians in the dispersion do, but that he says that they [autous]
   accusative of general reference) are not to go on circumcising
   [peritemnein], present active infinitive) their children. Paul taught
   the very opposite (1Co 7:18) and had Timothy circumcised (Ac 16:3)
   because he was half Jew and half Greek. His own practice is stated in
   1Co 9:19 ("to the Jews as a Jew"). Neither to walk after the customs
   [mede tois ethesin peripatein]. Locative case with infinitive
   [peripatein]. The charge was here enlarged to cover it all and to make
   Paul out an enemy of Jewish life and teachings. That same charge had
   been made against Stephen when young Saul (Paul) was the leader (6:14):
   "Will change the customs [ethe] the very word used here) which Moses
   delivered unto us." It actually seemed that some of the Jews cared more
   for Moses than for God (Ac 6:11). So much for the charge of the
   Judaizers.

   21:22 What is it therefore? [Ti oun estin?]. See this form of question
   by Paul (1Co 14:15, 26). What is to be done about it? Clearly James and
   the elders do not believe these misrepresentations of Paul's teaching,
   but many do. They will certainly hear [pantOs akousontai]. [PantOs] is
   old adverb, by all means, altogether, wholly, certainly as here and
   28:4; Lu 4:23; 1Co 9:10. This future middle of [akouO] is the usual
   form instead of [akousO]. There was no way to conceal Paul's arrival
   nor was it wise to do so. B C and several cursives omit [dei plethos
   sunelthein] (The multitude must needs come together).

   21:23 Do therefore this [touto oun poieson]. The elders had thought out
   a plan of procedure by which Paul could set the whole matter straight.
   We have [eisin hemin]. "There are to us" (dative of possession as in
   18:10). Apparently members of the Jerusalem church. Which have a vow on
   them [euchen echontes aph']-- or [eph' heautOn]. Apparently a temporary
   Nazarite vow like that in Nu 6:1-21 and its completion was marked by
   several offerings in the temple, the shaving of the head (Nu 6:13-15).
   Either Paul or Aquila had such a vow on leaving Cenchreae (Ac 18:18).
   "It was considered a work of piety to relieve needy Jews from the
   expenses connected with this vow, as Paul does here" (Page). The
   reading [aph' heautOn] would mean that they had taken the vow
   voluntarily or of themselves (Lu 12:57; 2Co 3:5), while [eph' heautOn]
   means that the vow lies on them still.

   21:24 These take [toutous paralabOn]. Second aorist active participle
   of [paralambanO]. Taking these alone. Purify thyself with them
   [hagnistheti sun autois]. First aorist passive imperative of [hagnizO],
   old verb to purify, to make pure [hagnos]. See the active voice in Jas
   4:8; 1Pe 1:22; 1Jo 3:3. It is possible to see the full passive force
   here, "Be purified." But a number of aorist passives in the Koine
   supplant the aorist middle forms and preserve the force of the middle
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 819). That is possible here. Hence, "Purify
   thyself" is allowable. The word occurs in Nu 6:1 for taking the
   Nazarite vow. The point is that Paul takes the vow with them. Note
   [hagnismou] in verse 26. Be at charges for them [dapaneson ep' autois].
   First aorist active imperative of old verb [dapanaO], to incur expense,
   expend. Spend (money) upon [ep'] them. Ramsay (St. Paul the Traveller,
   etc., p. 310) argues that Paul had use of considerable money at this
   period, perhaps from his father's estate. The charges for five men
   would be considerable. "A poor man would not have been treated with the
   respect paid him at Caesarea, on the voyage, and at Rome" (Furneaux).
   That they may shave their heads [hina xuresontai ten kephalen]. Note
   [ten kephalen], the head (singular). Future middle indicative of
   [xuraO], late form for the old [xureO], to shave, middle to shave
   oneself or (causative) to get oneself shaved. This use of [hina] with
   the future indicative is like the classic [hopOs] with the future
   indicative and is common in the N.T. as in the Koine (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 984). And all shall know [kai gnOsontai]. This future
   middle indicative of [ginOskO] (cf. [akousontai] in verse 22) may be
   independent of [hina] or dependent on it like [xuresontai], though some
   MSS. (H L P) have [gnOsin] (second aorist subjunctive, clearly
   dependent on [hina]. Of which [hOn]. Genitive plural of the relative
   [ha] (accusative) object of the perfect passive verb [katechentai] (cf.
   verse 21 [katechethesan] attracted into the case of the omitted
   antecedent [toutOn]. The instruction still in effect. But that thou
   thyself walkest orderly [alla stoicheis kai autos]. [Stoicheis] is an
   old verb to go in a row (from [stoichos], row, rank, series), to walk
   in a line or by rule. In the N.T. only here and Ga 5:25; Ro 4:12; Php
   3:16. The rule is the law and Paul was not a sidestepper. The idea of
   the verb is made plain by the participle [phulassOn ton nomon] (keeping
   or observing the law).

   21:25 We wrote [epesteilamen]. First aorist active of [epistellO], to
   send to and so to write like our epistle [epistole]. Old verb, but in
   the N.T. only here and Ac 15:20; Heb 13:22. It is the very word used by
   James in this "judgment" at the Conference (Ac 15:20, [episteilai]. B D
   here read [apesteilamen] from [apostellO], to send away, to give
   orders. Wendt and Schuerer object to this as a gloss. Rather is it an
   explanation by James that he does not refer to the Gentile Christians
   whose freedom from the Mosaic ceremonial law was guaranteed at the
   Jerusalem Conference. James himself presided at that Conference and
   offered the resolution that was unanimously adopted. James stands by
   that agreement and repeats the main items (four: anything sacrificed to
   idols, blood, anything strangled, fornication, for discussion see Ac
   15) from which they are to keep themselves (direct middle
   [phulassesthai] of [phulassO], indirect command after [krinantes] with
   accusative, [autous], of general reference). James has thus again
   cleared the air about the Gentiles who have believed [pepisteukotOn],
   perfect active participle genitive plural of [pisteuO]. He asks that
   Paul will stand by the right of Jewish Christians to keep on observing
   the Mosaic law. He has put the case squarely and fairly.

   21:26 Took the men [paralabOn tous andras]. The very phrase used in
   verse 24 to Paul. The next day [tei echomenei]. One of the phrases in
   20:15 for the coming day. Locative case of time. Purifying himself with
   them [sun autois hagnistheis], first aorist passive participle of
   [hagnizO]. The precise language again of the recommendation in verse
   24. Paul was conforming to the letter. Went into the temple [eiseiei
   eis to hieron]. Imperfect active of [eiseimi] as in verse 18 which see.
   Went on into the temple, descriptive imperfect. Paul joined the four
   men in their vow of separation. Declaring [diaggellOn]. To the priests
   what day he would report the fulfilment of the vow. The priests would
   desire notice of the sacrifice. This verb only used by Luke in N.T.
   except Ro 11:17 (quotation from the LXX). It is not necessary to assume
   that the vows of each of the five expired on the same day (Rackham).
   Until the offering was offered for every one of them [heOs hou
   prosenechthe huper henos hekastou autOn he prosphora]. This use of
   [heOs hou] (like [heOs], alone) with the first aorist passive
   indicative [prosenechthe] of [prospherO], to offer, contemplates the
   final result (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 974f.) and is probably the
   statement of Luke added to Paul's announcement. He probably went into
   the temple one day for each of the brethren and one for himself. The
   question arises whether Paul acted wisely or unwisely in agreeing to
   the suggestion of James. What he did was in perfect harmony with his
   principle of accommodation in 1Co 9:20 when no principle was involved.
   It is charged that here on this occasion Paul was unduly influenced by
   considerations of expediency and was willing for the Jewish Christians
   to believe him more of a Jew than was true in order to placate the
   situation in Jerusalem. Furneaux calls it a compromise and a failure. I
   do not so see it. To say that is to obscure the whole complex
   situation. What Paul did was not for the purpose of conciliating his
   opponents, the Judaizers, who had diligently spread falsehoods about
   him in Jerusalem as in Corinth. It was solely to break the power of
   these "false apostles" over the thousands in Jerusalem who have been
   deluded by Paul's accusers. So far as the evidence goes that thing was
   accomplished. In the trouble that comes in Jerusalem and Caesarea the
   Judaizers cut no figure at all. The Jewish Christians do not appear in
   Paul's behalf, but there was no opportunity for them to do so. The
   explosion that came on the last day of Paul's appearance in the temple
   was wholly disconnected from his offerings for the four brethren and
   himself. It must be remembered that Paul had many kinds of enemies. The
   attack on him by these Jews from Asia had no connexion whatever with
   the slanders of the Judaizers about Paul's alleged teachings that
   Jewish Christians in the dispersion should depart from the Mosaic law.
   That slander was put to rest forever by his following the advice of
   James and justifies the wisdom of that advice and Paul's conduct about
   it.

   21:27 The seven days [hai hepta hemerai]. For which Paul had taken the
   vow, though there may be an allusion to the pentecostal week for which
   Paul had desired to be present (20:16). There is no necessary connexion
   with the vow in 18:15. In 24:17 Paul makes a general reference to his
   purpose in coming to Jerusalem to bring alms and offerings
   [prosphoras], sacrifices). Paul spent seven days in Troas (20:6), Tyre
   (21:4), and had planned for seven here if not more. It was on the last
   of the seven days when Paul was completing his offerings about the vows
   on all five that the incident occurred that was to make him a prisoner
   for five years. When they saw him in the temple [theasamenoi auton en
   tOi hierOi]. First aorist middle participle of [theaomai] (from [thea],
   a view, cf. theatre) to behold. In the very act of honouring the temple
   these Jews from Asia raise a hue and cry that he is dishonouring it.
   Paul was not known by face now to many of the Jerusalem Jews, though
   once the leader of the persecution after the death of Stephen and the
   outstanding young Jew of the day. But the Jews in Ephesus knew him only
   too well, some of whom are here at the pentecostal feast. They had
   plotted against him in Ephesus to no purpose (Ac 19:23-41; 20:19), but
   now a new opportunity had come. It is possible that the cry was led by
   Alexander put forward by the Jews in Ephesus (19:33) who may be the
   same as Alexander the coppersmith who did Paul so much harm (2Ti 4:14).
   Paul was not in the inner sanctuary [ho naos], but only in the outer
   courts [to hieron]. Stirred up all the multitude [sunecheon panta ton
   ochlon]. Imperfect (kept on) active of [suncheO] or [sunchunO] [-unnO],
   to pour together, to confuse as in Ac 2:6; 9:22; 19:31,32; 21:31 and
   here to stir up by the same sort of confusion created by Demetrius in
   Ephesus where the same word is used twice (19:31, 32). The Jews from
   Ephesus had learned it from Demetrius the silversmith. Laid hands on
   him [epebalan ep' auton tas cheiras]. Second aorist (ingressive, with
   endings of the first aorist, [-an] active indicative of [epiballO], old
   verb to lay upon, to attack (note repetition of [epi]. They attacked
   and seized Paul before the charge was made.

   21:28 Help [boetheite]. Present active imperative of [boetheO], to run
   [theO] at a cry [boe], as if an outrage had been committed like murder
   or assault. All men everywhere [panta pantachei]. Alliterative.
   [Pantachei] is a variation in MSS., often [pantachou], and here only in
   the N.T. The charges against Paul remind one of those against Stephen
   (Ac 6:13) in which Paul had participated according to his confession
   (22:20). Like the charges against Stephen and Jesus before him truth
   and falsehood are mixed. Paul had said that being a Jew would not save
   a man. He had taught the law of Moses was not binding on Gentiles. He
   did hold, like Jesus and Stephen, that the temple was not the only
   place to worship God. But Paul gloried himself in being a Jew,
   considered the Mosaic law righteous for Jews, and was honouring the
   temple at this very moment. And moreover also he brought Greeks also
   into the temple [eti te kai Hellenas eisegagen eis to hieron]. Note the
   three particles [eti te kai], and [te] still more [eti] also or even
   [kai]. Worse than his teaching [didaskOn] is his dreadful deed: he
   actually brought [eisegagen], second aorist active indicative of
   [eisagO]. This he had a right to do if they only went into the court of
   the Gentiles. But these Jews mean to imply that Paul had brought Greeks
   beyond this court into the court of Israel. An inscription was found by
   Clermont-Ganneau in Greek built into the walls of a mosque on the Via
   Dolorosa that was on the wall dividing the court of Israel from the
   court of the Gentiles. Death was the penalty to any Gentile who crossed
   over into the Court of Israel (The Athenaeum, July, 1871). Hath defiled
   this holy place [kekoinOken ton hagion topon touton]. Present perfect
   active of [koinoO], to make common (see on 10:14). Note vivid change of
   tense, the defilement lasts (state of completion). All this is the
   substance of the call of these shrewd conspirators from Ephesus, Jews
   (not Jewish Christians, not even Judaizers) who hated him for his work
   there and who probably "spoke evil of the Way before the multitude"
   there so that Paul had to separate the disciples from the synagogue and
   go to the School of Tyrannus (19:9f.). These enemies of Paul had now
   raised the cry of "fire" and vanish from the scene completely (24:19).
   This charge was absolutely false as we shall see, made out of
   inferences of hate and suspicion.

   21:29 For [gar]. Luke adds the reason for the wild charges made against
   Paul. They had before seen [esan proeOrakotes]. Periphrastic past
   perfect of [prooraO], old verb to see before, whether time or place.
   Only twice in the N.T., here and Ac 2:25 quoted from Ps 15:8. Note the
   double reduplication in [-eO-] as in Attic (Robertson, Grammar, p.
   364). With him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian [Trophimon ton
   Ephesion en tei polei sun autOi]. The Jews from Asia (Ephesus) knew
   Trophimus by sight as well as Paul. One day they saw both of them
   together [sun] in the city. That was a fact. They had just seized Paul
   in the temple [hieron]. That was another fact. They supposed
   [enomizon]. Imperfect active of [nomizO], common to think or suppose.
   Perfectly harmless word, but they did, as so many people do, put their
   supposed inference on the same basis with the facts. They did not see
   Trophimus with Paul now in the temple, nor had they ever seen him
   there. They simply argued that, if Paul was willing to be seen down
   street with a Greek Christian, he would not hesitate to bring him
   (therefore, did bring him, [eisegagen] as in verse 28) into the temple,
   that is into the court of Israel and therefore both Paul and Trophimus
   were entitled to death, especially Paul who had brought him in (if he
   had) and, besides, they now had Paul. This is the way of the mob-mind
   in all ages. Many an innocent man has been rushed to his death by the
   fury of a lynching party.

   21:30 All the city was shaken [ekinethe he polis hole]. First aorist
   passive of [kineO], common verb for violent motion and emotion. See
   also 24:5 where the word is used by Tertullus of Paul as the stirrer up
   of riots! The people ran together [egeneto sundrome tou laou]. Rather,
   There came a running together [sun-drome] from [sun-trechO] of the
   people. The cry spread like wildfire over the city and there was a
   pell-mell scramble or rush to get to the place of the disturbance. They
   laid hold on Paul [epilabomenoi tou Paulou]. Second aorist middle
   participle of [epilambanomai] with the genitive (cf. [epebalan] in
   verse 27). Dragged [heilkon]. Imperfect active of [helkO] (and also
   [helkuO], old verb to drag or draw. Imperfect tense vividly pictures
   the act as going on. They were saving the temple by dragging Paul
   outside. Curiously enough both [epilabomenoi] and [heilkusan] occur in
   16:19 about the arrest of Paul and Silas in Philippi. Straightway the
   doors were shut [eutheOs ekleisthesan hai thurai]. With a bang and at
   once. First aorist (effective) passive of [kleiO]. The doors between
   the inner court and the court of the Gentiles. But this was only the
   beginning, the preparation for the real work of the mob. They did not
   wish to defile the holy place with blood. The doors were shut by the
   Levites.

   21:31 As they were seeking to kill him [zetountOn autOn]. Genitive
   absolute of [zeteO], to seek, without [autOn] (they). This was their
   real purpose. Tidings [phasis]. From [phainO], to show. Old word for
   the work of informers and then the exposure of secret crime. In LXX.
   Here only in the N.T. Came up [anebe]. Naturally in the wild uproar.
   The Roman guard during festivals was kept stationed in the Tower of
   Antonia at the northwest corner of the temple overlooking the temple
   and connected by stairs (verse 35). To the chief captain [tOi
   chiliarchOi]. Commander of a thousand men or cohort (Mr 15:16). His
   name was Claudius Lysias. Of the band [tes speires]. Each legion had
   six tribunes and so each tribune (chiliarch) had a thousand if the
   cohort had its full quota. See on 10:1; 27:1. The word is the Latin
   spira (anything rolled up). Note the genitive [speires] instead of
   [speiras] (Attic). Was in confusion [sunchunnetai]. Present passive
   indicative of [sunchunnO] (see verse 27, [sunecheon]. This is what the
   conspirators had desired.

   21:32 Forthwith [exautes]. Common in the Koine [ex autes], supply
   [hOras], hour). He took [paralabOn]. See verses 24, 26. Centurions
   [hekatontarchas]. See on Lu 7:2 for discussion. Plural shows that
   Lysias the chiliarch took several hundred soldiers along (a centurion
   with each hundred). Ran down [katedramen]. Effective second aorist
   active indicative of [katatrechO]. From the tower of Antonia, vivid
   scene. And they [hoi de]. Demonstrative use of [hoi]. The Jewish mob
   who had begun the work of killing Paul (verse 31). Left off beating
   Paul [epausanto tuptontes ton Paulon]. The participle with [pauomai]
   describes what they were already doing, the supplementary participle
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1121). They stopped before the job was over
   because of the sudden onset of the Roman soldiers. Some ten years
   before in a riot at the passover the Roman guard marched down and in
   the panic several hundred were trampled to death.

   21:33 Came near [eggisas]. First aorist active participle of [eggizO],
   to draw near, Koine verb from [eggus], near, and common in the N.T.
   Laid hold on him [epelabeto antou]. See same verb in verse 30. To be
   bound [dethenai]. First aorist passive infinitive of [deO] (see verse
   11). With two chains [halusesi dusi]. Instrumental case of [halusis],
   old word from [a] privative and [luO] (not loosing, i.e. chaining).
   With two chains as a violent and seditious person, probably leader of a
   band of assassins (verse 38). See on Mr 5:4. Inquired [epunthaneto].
   Imperfect middle of [punthanomai], old and common verb used mainly by
   Luke in the N.T. Lysias repeated his inquiries. Who he was [tis eie].
   Present active optative of [eimi] changed from [estin] (present
   indicative) in the indirect question, a change not obligatory after a
   past tense, but often done in the older Greek, rare in the N.T.
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1043f.). And what he had done [kai ti estin
   pepoiekOs]. Periphrastic perfect active indicative of [poieO] here
   retained, not changed to the optative as is true of [eie] from [estin]
   in the same indirect question, illustrating well the freedom about it.

   21:34 Some shouting one thing, some another [alloi allo ti epephOnoun].
   Same idiom of [alloi allo] as in 19:32 which see. The imperfect of
   [epiphOneO], to call out to, suits well the idiom. This old verb occurs
   in the N.T. only in Luke and Acts (already in 12:22). When he could not
   know [me dunamenou autou gnOnai]. Genitive absolute of present middle
   participle of [dunamai] with negative [me] and second aorist active
   infinitive of [ginOskO]. The certainty [to asphales]. Neuter articular
   adjective from [a] privative and [sphallO], to make totter or fall. Old
   word, in the N.T. only in Ac 21:34; 22:30; 25:26; Php 3:1; Heb 6:19.
   Into the castle [eis ten parembolen]. Koine word from [paremballO], to
   cast in by the side of, to assign soldiers a place, to encamp (see on
   Lu 19:43). So [parembole] comes to mean an interpolation, then an army
   drawn up (Heb 11:34), but mainly an encampment (Heb 13:11, 13),
   frequent in Polybius and LXX. So here barracks of the Roman soldiers in
   the tower of Antonia as in verse 37; 22:24; 23:10, 16, 32.

   21:35 Upon the stairs [epi tous anabathmous]. From [ana], up, and
   [bainO], to go. Late word, in LXX and Koine writers. In the N.T. only
   here and verse 40. So it was [sunebe]. Second aorist active of
   [sumbainO], to happen (see on 20:19) with infinitive clause as subject
   here as often in the old Greek. He was borne [bastazesthai auton].
   Accusative of general reference with this subject infinitive, present
   passive of [bastazO], to take up with the hands, literally as here.
   Violence [bian]. See on Ac 5:26. [BiazO], to use force, is from [bia].

   21:36 Followed after [ekolouthei]. Imperfect active of [akolutheO], was
   following. Cheated of their purpose to lynch Paul, they were determined
   to have his blood. Crying out [krazontes]. Construction according to
   sense, plural masculine participle agreeing with neuter singular
   substantive [plethos] (Robertson, Grammar, p. 401). Away with him [Aire
   auton]. The very words used by the mob to Pilate when they chose
   Barabbas in preference to Jesus (Lu 23:18, [Aire touton]. He will hear
   it again from this same crowd (Ac 22:22). It is the present imperative
   [aire] as in Lu 23:18, but some may have used the urgent aorist active
   imperative as also in the case of Jesus Joh 19:15, [aron, aron] with
   [staurOson] added). Luke does not say that this mob demanded
   crucifixion for Paul. He was learning what it was to share the
   sufferings of Christ as the sullen roar of the mob's yells rolled on
   and on in his ears.

   21:37 May I say something unto thee? [Ei exestin moi eipein ti pros
   se?]. On this use of [ei] in a direct question see on 1:6. The calm
   self-control of Paul in the presence of this mob is amazing. His
   courteous request to Lysias was in Greek to the chiliarch's amazement.
   Dost thou know Greek? [Hellenisti ginOskeis?]. Old Greek adverb in [-i]
   from [HellenizO], meaning "in Greek." "Do you know it in Greek?" In the
   N.T. only here and Joh 19:20. Art thou not then the Egyptian? [Ouk ara
   su ei ho Aiguptios?]. Expects the answer Yes and [ara] argues the
   matter (therefore). The well-known [ho] Egyptian who had given the
   Romans so much trouble. Stirred up to sedition [anastatOsas]. First
   aorist active participle of [anastatoO], a late verb from [anastatos],
   outcast, and so to unsettle, to stir up, to excite, once known only in
   LXX and Ac 17:6 (which see); 21:38; Ga 5:12, but now found in several
   papyri examples with precisely this sense to upset. Of the Assassins
   [tOn sikariOn]. Latin word sicarius, one who carried a short sword
   [sica] under his cloak, a cutthroat. Josephus uses this very word for
   bands of robbers under this Egyptian (War II. 17,6 and 13,5; Ant. XX.
   8,10). Josephus says that there were 30,000 who gathered on the Mount
   of Olives to see the walls of Jerusalem fall down and not merely 4,000
   as Lysias does here. But Lysias may refer to the group that were armed
   thus (banditti) the core of the mob of 30,000. Lysias at once saw by
   Paul's knowledge of Greek that he was not the famous Egyptian who led
   the Assassins and escaped himself when Felix attacked and slew the most
   of them.

   21:39 I am [EgO men eimi]. In contrast with the wild guess of Lysias
   Paul uses [men] and [de]. He tells briefly who he is: a Jew [Ioudaios]
   by race, of Tarsus in Cilicia [Tarseus tes Kilikias] by country,
   belonging to Tarsus (this adjective [Tarseus] only here and Ac 9:11),
   and proud of it, one of the great cities of the empire with a great
   university. A citizen of no mean city [ouk asemou poleOs polites].
   Litotes again, "no mean" [asemos], old adjective, unmarked, [a]
   privative and [sema], mark, insignificant, here only in the N.T.). This
   same litotes used by Euripides of Athens (Ion 8). But Paul calls
   himself a citizen [polites] of Tarsus. Note the "effective assonance"
   (Page) in [poleOs polites]. Paul now [de] makes his request [deomai] of
   Lysias. Give me leave [epitrepson moi]. First aorist active imperative
   of [epitrepO], old and common verb to turn to, to permit, to allow. It
   was a strange request and a daring one, to wish to speak to this mob
   howling for Paul's blood.

   21:40 When he had given him leave [epitrepsantos autou]. Genitive
   absolute of aorist active participle of the same verb [epitrepO].
   Standing on the stairs [hestOs epi tOn anabathmOn]. Second perfect
   active participle of [histemi], to place, but intransitive to stand.
   Dramatic scene. Paul had faced many audiences and crowds, but never one
   quite like this. Most men would have feared to speak, but not so Paul.
   He will speak about himself only as it gives him a chance to put Christ
   before this angry Jewish mob who look on Paul as a renegade Jew, a
   turncoat, a deserter, who went back on Gamaliel and all the traditions
   of his people, who not only turned from Judaism to Christianity, but
   who went after Gentiles and treated Gentiles as if they were on a par
   with Jews. Paul knows only too well what this mob thinks of him.
   Beckoned with the hand [kateseise tei cheiri]. He shook down to the
   multitude with the hand (instrumental case [cheiri], while Alexander,
   Luke says (19:33), "shook down the hand" (accusative with the same
   verb, which see). In 26:1 Paul reached out the hand [ekteinas ten
   cheira]. When there was made a great silence [polles siges genomenes].
   Genitive absolute again with second aorist middle participle of
   [ginomai], "much silence having come." Paul waited till silence had
   come. In the Hebrew language [tei Ebraidi dialektOi]. The Aramaean
   which the people in Jerusalem knew better than the Greek. Paul could
   use either tongue at will. His enemies had said in Corinth that "his
   bodily presence was weak and his speech contemptible" (2Co 10:10). But
   surely even they would have to admit that Paul's stature and words
   reach heroic proportions on this occasion. Self-possessed with majestic
   poise Paul faces the outraged mob beneath the stairs.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 22

   22:1 Brethren and fathers [Andres adelphoi kai pateres] Men, brethren,
   and fathers. The very language used by Stephen (7:2) when arraigned
   before the Sanhedrin with Paul then present. Now Paul faces a Jewish
   mob on the same charges brought against Stephen. These words are those
   of courtesy and dignity (amoris et honoris nomina, Page). These men
   were Paul's brother Jews and were (many of them) official
   representatives of the people (Sanhedrists, priests, rabbis). Paul's
   purpose is conciliatory, he employs "his ready tact" (Rackham). The
   defence which I now make unto you [mou tes pros humas nuni apologias].
   Literally, My defence to you at this time. [Nuni] is a sharpened form
   (by [-i] of [nun] (now), just now. The term [apologia] (apology) is not
   our use of the word for apologizing for an offence, but the original
   sense of defence for his conduct, his life. It is an old word from
   [apologeomai], to talk oneself off a charge, to make defence. It occurs
   also in Ac 25:16 and then also in 1Co 9:3; 2Co 7:11; Php 1:7, 16; 2Ti
   4:16; 1Pe 3:15. Paul uses it again in Ac 25:16 as here about his
   defence against the charges made by the Jews from Asia. He is suspected
   of being a renegade from the Mosaic law and charged with specific acts
   connected with the alleged profanation of the temple. So Paul speaks in
   Aramaic and recites the actual facts connected with his change from
   Judaism to Christianity. The facts make the strongest argument. He
   first recounts the well-known story of his zeal for Judaism in the
   persecution of the Christians and shows why the change came. Then he
   gives a summary of his work among the Gentiles and why he came to
   Jerusalem this time. He answers the charge of enmity to the people and
   the law and of desecration of the temple. It is a speech of great skill
   and force, delivered under remarkable conditions. The one in chapter Ac
   26 covers some of the same ground, but for a slightly different purpose
   as we shall see. For a discussion of the three reports in Acts of
   Paul's conversion see chapter Ac 9. Luke has not been careful to make
   every detail correspond, though there is essential agreement in all
   three.

   22:2 He spake [prosephOnei]. Imperfect active, was speaking. See aorist
   active [prosephOnesen] in 21:40. They were the more quiet [mallon
   pareschon hesuchian]. Literally, The more [mallon] they furnished or
   supplied (second aorist active indicative of [parechO] quietness
   [hesuchian], old word, in the N.T. only here and 2Th 3:12; 1Ti
   2:11ff.). Precisely this idiom occurs in Plutarch (Cor. 18) and the LXX
   (Job 34:29). Knowling notes the fondness of Luke for words of silence
   [sige, sigaO, hesuchazO] as in Lu 14:4; 15:26; Ac 11:18; 12:17; 15:12;
   21:14,40. It is a vivid picture of the sudden hush that swept over the
   vast mob under the spell of the Aramaic. They would have understood
   Paul's Koine Greek, but they much preferred the Aramaic. It was a
   masterstroke.

   22:3 I am a Jew [EgO eimi aner Ioudaios]. Note use of [EgO] for
   emphasis. Paul recounts his Jewish advantages or privileges with
   manifest pride as in Ac 26:4f.; 2Co 11:22; Ga 1:14; Php 3:4-7. Born
   [gegennemenos]. Perfect passive participle of [gennaO]. See above in
   21:39 for the claim of Tarsus as his birth-place. He was a Hellenistic
   Jew, not an Aramaean Jew (cf. Ac 6:1). Brought up [anatethrammenos].
   Perfect passive participle again of [anatrephO], to nurse up, to
   nourish up, common old verb, but in the N.T. only here, 7:20ff., and
   MSS. in Lu 4:16. The implication is that Paul was sent to Jerusalem
   while still young, "from my youth" (26:4), how young we do not know,
   possibly thirteen or fourteen years old. He apparently had not seen
   Jesus in the flesh (2Co 5:16). At the feet of Gamaliel [pros tous podas
   Gamaliel]. The rabbis usually sat on a raised seat with the pupils in a
   circle around either on lower seats or on the ground. Paul was thus
   nourished in Pharisaic Judaism as interpreted by Gamaliel, one of the
   lights of Judaism. For remarks on Gamaliel see chapter 5:34ff. He was
   one of the seven Rabbis to whom the Jews gave the highest title
   [Rabban] (our Rabbi). [Rabbi] (my teacher) was next, the lowest being
   [Rab] (teacher). "As Aquinas among the schoolmen was called Doctor
   Angelicus, and Bonaventura Doctor Seraphicus, so Gamaliel was called
   the Beauty of the Law" (Conybeare and Howson). Instructed
   [pepaideumenos]. Perfect passive participle again (each participle
   beginning a clause), this time of [paideuO], old verb to train a child
   [pais] as in 7:22 which see. In this sense also in 1Ti 1:20; Tit 2:12.
   Then to chastise as in Lu 23:16, 22 (which see); 2Ti 2:25; Heb 12:6f.
   According to the strict manner [kata akribeian]. Old word, only here in
   N.T. Mathematical accuracy, minute exactness as seen in the adjective
   in 26:5. See also Ro 10:2; Gal 1:4; Php 3:4-7. Of our fathers
   [patrOiou]. Old adjective from [pater], only here and 24:14 in N.T.
   Means descending from father to son, especially property and other
   inherited privileges. [Patrikos] (patrician) refers more to personal
   attributes and affiliations. Being zealous for God [zelOtes huparchOn
   tou theou]. Not adjective, but substantive zealot (same word used by
   James of the thousands of Jewish Christians in Jerusalem, 21:20 which
   see) with objective genitive [tou theou] (for God). See also verse 14;
   28:17; 2Ti 1:3 where he makes a similar claim. So did Peter (Ac 3:13;
   5:30) and Stephen (7:32). Paul definitely claims, whatever freedom he
   demanded for Gentile Christians, to be personally "a zealot for God"
   "even as ye all are this day" [kathOs pantes humeis este semeron]. In
   his conciliation he went to the limit and puts himself by the side of
   the mob in their zeal for the law, mistaken as they were about him. He
   was generous surely to interpret their fanatical frenzy as zeal for
   God. But Paul is sincere as he proceeds to show by appeal to his own
   conduct.

   22:4 And I [hos]. I who, literally. This Way [tauten ten hodon]. The
   very term used for Christianity by Luke concerning Paul's persecution
   (9:2), which see. Here it "avoids any irritating name for the Christian
   body" (Furneaux) by using this Jewish terminology. Unto the death
   [achri thanatou]. Unto death, actual death of many as 26:10 shows. Both
   men and women [andras te kai gunaikas]. Paul felt ashamed of this fact
   and it was undoubtedly in his mind when he pictured his former state as
   "a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious (1Ti 1:13), the first of
   sinners" (1Ti 1:15). But it showed the lengths to which Paul went in
   his zeal for Judaism.

   22:5 Doth bear me witness [marturei moi]. Present active indicative as
   if still living. Caiaphas was no longer high priest now, for Ananias is
   at this time (23:2), though he may be still alive. All the estate of
   the elders [pan to presbuterion]. All the eldership or the Sanhedrin
   (4:5) of which Paul was probably then a member (26:10). Possibly some
   of those present were members of the Sanhedrin then (some 20 odd years
   ago). From whom [par' hOn]. The high priest and the Sanhedrin. Letters
   unto the brethren [epistalas pros tous adelphous]. Paul still can
   tactfully call the Jews his "brothers" as he did in Ro 9:3. There is no
   bitterness in his heart. Journeyed [eporeuomen]. Imperfect middle
   indicative of [poreuomai], and a vivid reality to Paul still as he was
   going on towards Damascus. To bring also [axOn kai]. Future active
   participle of [agO], to express purpose, one of the few N.T. examples
   of this classic idiom (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1118). Them which were
   there [tous ekeise ontas]. Constructio praegnans. The usual word would
   be [ekei] (there), not [ekeise] (thither). Possibly the Christians who
   had fled to Damascus, and so were there (Robertson, Grammar, p. 548).
   In bonds [dedemenous]. Perfect passive participle of [deO], predicate
   position, "bound." For to be punished [hina timOrethOsin]. First aorist
   passive subjunctive of [timOreO], old verb to avenge, to take vengeance
   on. In the N.T. only here, and 26:11. Pure final clause with [hina]. He
   carried his persecution outside of Palestine just as later he carried
   the gospel over the Roman empire.

   22:6 And it came to pass [egeneto de]. Rather than the common [kai
   egeneto] and with the infinitive [periastrapsai], one of the three
   constructions with [kai (de) egeneto] by Luke (Robertson, Grammar, pp.
   1042f.), followed by [kai], by finite verb, by subject infinitive as
   here. As I made my journey [moi poreuomenOi]. To me (dative after
   [egeneto], happened to me) journeying (participle agreeing with [moi].
   See this same idiom in verse 17. Luke uses [egeneto de] seventeen times
   in the gospel and twenty-one in the Acts. Unto Damascus [tei DamaskOi].
   Dative after [eggizonti] (drawing nigh to). About noon [peri
   mesembrian]. Mid [mesos] day [hemera], old word, in the N.T. only here
   and 8:26 which see where it may mean "toward the south." An item not in
   ch. 9. Shone round about me [periastrapsai peri eme]. First aorist
   active infinitive of [periastraptO], to flash around, in LXX and late
   Greek, in the N.T. only here and 9:3 which see. Note repetition of
   [peri]. A great light [phOs hikanon]. Luke's favourite word [hikanon]
   (considerable). Accusative of general reference with the infinitive.

   22:7 I fell [epesa]. Second aorist active indicative with [-a] rather
   than [epeson], the usual form of [piptO]. Unto the ground [eis to
   edaphos]. Old word, here alone in N.T. So the verb [edaphizO], is in Lu
   19:44 alone in the N.T. A voice saying [phOnes legouses]. Genitive
   after [ekousa], though in 26:14 the accusative is used after [ekousa],
   as in 22:14 after [akousai], either being allowable. See on 9:7 for
   discussion of the difference in case. Saul's name repeated each time
   (9:4; 22:7; 26:14). Same question also in each report: "Why persecuted
   thou me?" [Ti me diOkeis?]. These piercing words stuck in Paul's mind.

   22:8 Of Nazareth [ho NazOraios]. The Nazarene, not in 9:5; 26:15 and
   here because Jesus is mentioned now for the first time in the address.
   The form [NazOraios] as in Mt 2:23 (which see) is used also in 24:5 for
   the followers of Jesus instead of [Nazarenos] as in Mr 1:24, etc.
   (which see).

   22:9 But they heard not the voice [ten de phOnen ouk ekousan]. The
   accusative here may be used rather than the genitive as in verse 7 to
   indicate that those with Paul did not understand what they heard (9:7)
   just as they beheld the light (22:9), but did not see Jesus (9:7). The
   difference in cases allows this distinction, though it is not always
   observed as just noticed about 22:14; 26:14. The verb [akouO] is used
   in the sense of understand (Mr 4:33; 1Co 14:2). It is one of the
   evidences of the genuineness of this report of Paul's speech that Luke
   did not try to smooth out apparent discrepancies in details between the
   words of Paul and his own record already in ch. 9. The Textus Receptus
   adds in this verse: "And they became afraid" [kai emphoboi egenonto].
   Clearly not genuine.

   22:10 Into Damascus [eis Damaskon]. In 9:6 simply "into the city" [eis
   ten polin]. Of all things which [peri pantOn hOn]. [HOn], relative
   plural attracted to genitive of antecedent from accusative [ha], object
   of [poiesai] (do). Are appointed for thee [tetaktai soi]. Perfect
   passive indicative of [tassO], to appoint, to order, with dative [soi].
   Compare with [hoti se dei] of 9:6. The words were spoken to Paul, of
   course, in the Aramaic, Saoul, Saoul.

   22:11 I could not see [ouk eneblepon]. Imperfect active of [emblepO], I
   was not seeing, same fact stated in 9:8. Here the reason as "for the
   glory of that light" [apo tes doxes tou phOtos ekeinou]. Being led by
   the hand [cheiragOgoumenos]. Present passive participle of
   [cheiragOgeO], the same verb used in 9:8 [cheiragOgountes] which see.
   Late verb, in the N.T. only in these two places. In LXX.

   22:12 A devout man according to the law [eulabes kata ton nomon]. See
   on 2:5; 8:2; Lu 2:25 for the adjective [eulabes]. Paul adds "according
   to the law" to show that he was introduced to Christianity by a devout
   Jew and no law-breaker (Lewin).

   22:13 I looked up on him [anablepsa eis auton]. First aorist active
   indicative and same word as [anablepson] (Receive thy sight). Hence
   here the verb means as the margin of the Revised Version has it: "I
   received my sight and looked upon him." For "look up" see Joh 9:11.

   22:14 Hath appointed thee [proecheirisato]. First aorist middle
   indicative of [procheirizO], old verb to put forth into one's hands, to
   take into one's hands beforehand, to plan, propose, determine. In the
   N.T. only in Ac 3:20; 22:14; 26:16. Three infinitives after this verb
   of God's purpose about Paul: to know [gnOnai], second aorist active of
   [ginOskO] his will, to see [idein], second aorist active of [horaO] the
   Righteous One (cf. 3:14), to hear [akousai], first aorist active of
   [akouO] a voice from his mouth.

   22:15 A witness for him [martus autOi]. As in 1:8. Of what [hOn].
   Attraction of the accusative relative [ha] to the genitive case of the
   unexpressed antecedent [toutOn]. Thou hast seen and heard [heOrakas],
   present perfect active indicative [kai ekousas], first aorist active
   indicative). This subtle change of tense is not preserved in the
   English. Blass properly cites the perfect [heOraka] in 1Co 9:1 as proof
   of Paul's enduring qualification for the apostleship.

   22:16 By baptized [baptisai]. First aorist middle (causative), not
   passive, Get thyself baptized (Robertson, Grammar, p. 808). Cf. 1Co
   10:2. Submit yourself to baptism. So as to [apolousai], Get washed off
   as in 1Co 6:11. It is possible, as in 2:38, to take these words as
   teaching baptismal remission or salvation by means of baptism, but to
   do so is in my opinion a complete subversion of Paul's vivid and
   picturesque language. As in Ro 6:4-6 where baptism is the picture of
   death, burial and resurrection, so here baptism pictures the change
   that had already taken place when Paul surrendered to Jesus on the way
   (verse 10). Baptism here pictures the washing away of sins by the blood
   of Christ.

   22:17 When I had returned [moi hupostrepsanti], while I prayed
   [proseuchomenou mou], I fell [genesthai me]. Note dative [moi] with
   [egeneto] as in verse 6, genitive [mou] (genitive absolute with
   [proseuchomenou], accusative of general reference [me] with
   [genesthai], and with no effort at uniformity, precisely as in 15:22,
   23 which see. The participle is especially liable to such examples of
   anacolutha (Robertson, Grammar, p. 439).

   22:18 Saw him saying [idein auton legonta]. The first visit after his
   conversion when they tried to kill him in Jerusalem (9:29). Because
   [dioti, dia] and [hoti], for that.

   22:19 Imprisoned and beat [emen phulakizOn kai derOn]. Periphrastic
   imperfect active of [phulakizO] (LXX and late Koine, here alone in the
   N.T.) and [derO] (old verb to skin, to beat as in Mt 21:35 which see).
   In every synagogue [kata tas sunagogas]. Up and down [kata] in the
   synagogues.

   22:20 Was shed [exechunneto]. Imperfect passive of [ekchunnO] (see on
   Mt 23:35), was being shed. Witness [marturos]. And "martyr" also as in
   Re 2:13; 17:6. Transition state for the word here. I also was standing
   by [kai autos emen ephestOs]. Periphrastic second past perfect in form,
   but imperfect (linear) in sense since [hestOs=histamenos]
   (intransitive). Consenting [suneudokOn]. The very word used by Luke in
   Ac 8:1 about Paul. Koine word for being pleased at the same time with
   (cf. Lu 11:48). Paul adds here the item of "guarding the clothes of
   those who were slaying [anairountOn] as in Lu 23:32; Ac 12:2) him"
   (Stephen). Paul recalls the very words of protest used by him to Jesus.
   He did not like the idea of running away to save his own life right
   where he had helped slay Stephen. He is getting on dangerous ground.

   22:21 I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles [EgO eis ethne
   makran exapostelO se]. Future active of the double [ex], out, [apo],
   off or away) compound of [exapostellO], common word in the Koine (cf.
   Lu 24:49). This is a repetition by Jesus of the call given in Damascus
   through Ananias (9:15). Paul had up till now avoided the word Gentiles,
   but at last it had to come, "the fatal word" (Farrar).

   22:22 They gave him audience [ekouon]. Imperfect active, they kept on
   listening, at least with respectful attention. Unto this word [achri
   toutou tou logou]. But "this word" was like a spark in a powder
   magazine or a torch to an oil tank. The explosion of pent-up
   indignation broke out instantly worse than at first (21:30). Away with
   such a fellow from the earth [Aire apo tes ges ton toiouton]. They
   renew the cry with the very words in 21:36, but with "from the earth"
   for vehemence. For it is not fit [ou gar katheken]. Imperfect active of
   [kathekO], old verb to come down to, to become, to fit. In the N.T.
   only here and Ro 1:28. The imperfect is a neat Greek idiom for
   impatience about an obligation: It was not fitting, he ought to have
   been put to death long ago. The obligation is conceived as not lived up
   to like our "ought" (past of owe). See Robertson, Grammar, p. 886.

   22:23 As they cried out [kraugazontOn autOn]. Genitive absolute with
   present active participle of [kraugazO], a rare word in the old Greek
   from [krauge] (a cry). See on Mt 12:19. Two other genitive absolutes
   here, [rhiptountOn] (throwing off, present active participle, frequent
   active variation of [rhiptO] and [ballontOn] (present active participle
   of [ballO], flinging). These present participles give a lively picture
   of the uncontrolled excitement of the mob in their spasm of wild rage.

   22:24 That he be examined by scourging [mastixin anetazesthai auton].
   The present passive infinitive of [anetazO] in indirect command after
   [eipas] (bidding). This verb does not occur in the old Greek (which
   used [exetazO] as in Mt 2:8), first in the LXX, in the N.T. only here
   and verse 29, but Milligan and Moulton's Vocabulary quotes an
   Oxyrhynchus papyrus of A.D. 127 which has a prefect using the word
   directing government clerks to "examine" [anetazein] documents and glue
   them together into volumes [tomoi]. The word was evidently in use for
   such purposes. It was a kind of "third degree" applied to Paul by the
   use of scourges [mastixin], instrumental plural of [mastix], old word
   for whip, as in Heb 11:36. But this way of beginning an inquiry by
   torture (inquisition) was contrary to Roman law (Page): Non esse a
   tormentis incipiendum, Divus Augustus statuit. That he might know [hina
   epignOi]. Final clause with [hina] and second aorist active subjunctive
   of [epignOskO] (full knowledge). Lysias was as much in the dark as
   ever, for Paul's speech had been in Aramaic and this second explosion
   was a mystery to him like the first. They so shouted [houtos
   epephOnoun]. Imperfect active progressive imperfect had been so
   shouting.

   22:25 When they had tied him up [hos proeteinan auton]. First aorist
   active indicative of [proteinO], old verb to stretch forward, only here
   in the N.T. Literally, "When they stretched him forward." With the
   thongs [tois himasin]. If the instrumental case of [himas], old word
   for strap or thong (for sandals as Mr 1:7, or for binding criminals as
   here), then Paul was bent forward and tied by the thongs to a post in
   front to expose his back the better to the scourges. But [tois himasin]
   may be dative case and then it would mean "for the lashes." In either
   case it is a dreadful scene of terrorizing by the chiliarch. Unto the
   centurion that stood by [pros ton hestOta hekatontarchon]. He was
   simply carrying out the orders of the chiliarch (cf. Mt 27:54). Why had
   not Paul made protest before this? Is it lawful? [ei exestin?]. This
   use of [ei] in indirect questions we have had before (1:6). A Roman and
   uncondemned [Romaion kai akatakriton]. Just as in 16:37 which see.
   Blass says of Paul's question: Interrogatio subironica est confidentiae
   plena.

   22:26 What art thou about to do? [Ti melleis poiein?]. On the point of
   doing, sharp warning.

   22:27 Art thou a Roman? [Su Romaios ei?]. Thou (emphatic position) a
   Roman? It was unbelievable.

   22:28 With a great sum [pollou kephalaiou]. The use of [kephalaiou]
   (from [kephale], head) for sums of money (principal as distinct from
   interest) is old and frequent in the papyri. Our word capital is from
   [caput] (head). The genitive is used here according to rule for price.
   "The sale of the Roman citizenship was resorted to by the emperors as a
   means of filling the exchequer, much as James I. made baronets" (Page).
   Dio Cassius (LX., 17) tells about Messalina the wife of Claudius
   selling Roman citizenship. Lysias was probably a Greek and so had to
   buy his citizenship. But I am a Roman born [EgO de kai gegennemai].
   Perfect passive indicative of [gennaO]. The word "Roman" not in the
   Greek. Literally, "But I have been even born one," (i.e. born a Roman
   citizen). There is calm and simple dignity in this reply and pardonable
   pride. Being a citizen of Tarsus (21:39) did not make Paul a Roman
   citizen. Tarsus was an urbs libera, not a colonia like Philippi. Some
   one of his ancestors (father, grandfather) obtained it perhaps as a
   reward for distinguished service. Paul's family was of good social
   position. "He was educated by the greatest of the Rabbis; he was at an
   early age entrusted by the Jewish authorities with an important
   commission; his nephew could gain ready access to the Roman tribune; he
   was treated as a person of consequence by Felix, Festus, Agrippa, and
   Julius" (Furneaux).

   22:29 Departed from him [apestesan ap' autou]. Second aorist active
   indicative (intransitive) of [aphistemi], stood off from him at once.
   Was afraid [ephobethe]. Ingressive aorist passive indicative of
   [phobeomai], became afraid. He had reason to be. That he was a Roman
   [hoti Romaios estin]. Indirect assertion with tense of [estin]
   retained. Because he had bound him [hoti auton en dedekOs]. Causal
   [hoti] here after declarative [hoti] just before. Periphrastic past
   perfect active of [deO], to bind.

   22:30 To know the certainty [gnOnai to asphales]. Same idiom in 21:34
   which see. Wherefore he was accused [to ti kategoreitai]. Epexegetical
   after to [asphales]. Note article (accusative case) with the indirect
   question here as in Lu 22:1, 23, 24 (which see), a neat idiom in the
   Greek. Commanded [ekeleusen]. So the Sanhedrin had to meet, but in the
   Tower of Antonia, for he brought Paul down [katagagOn], second aorist
   active participle of [katagO]. Set him [estesen]. First aorist active
   (transitive) indicative of [histemi], not the intransitive second
   aorist [este]. Lysias is determined to find out the truth about Paul,
   more puzzled than ever by the important discovery that he has a Roman
   citizen on his hands in this strange prisoner.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 23

   23:1 Looking steadfastly [atenisas]. See on this word 1:10; 3:12; 6:15;
   7:55; 13:9. Paul may have had weak eyes, but probably the earnest gaze
   was to see if he recognized any faces that were in the body that tried
   Stephen and to which he apparently once belonged. I have lived before
   God [pepoliteumai tOi theOi]. Perfect middle indicative of [politeuO],
   old verb to manage affairs of city [polis] or state, to be a citizen,
   behave as a citizen. In the N.T. only here and Php 1:27. The idea of
   citizenship was Greek and Roman, not Jewish. "He had lived as God's
   citizen, as a member of God's commonwealth" (Rackham). God [theOi] is
   the dative of personal interest. As God looked at it and in his
   relation to God. In all good conscience unto this day [pasei suneidesei
   agathei achri tautes tes hemeras]. This claim seems to lack tact, but
   for brevity's sake Paul sums up a whole speech in it. He may have said
   much more than Luke here reports along the line of his speech the day
   before, but Paul did not make this claim without consideration. It
   appears to contradict his confession as the chief of sinners (1Ti
   1:13-16). But that depends on one's interpretation of "good
   conscience." The word [suneidesis] is literally "joint-knowledge" in
   Greek, Latin (conscientia) and English "conscience" from the Latin. It
   is a late word from [sunoida], to know together, common in O.T.,
   Apocrypha, Philo, Plutarch, New Testament, Stoics, ecclesiastical
   writers. In itself the word simply means consciousness of one's own
   thoughts (Heb 10:2), or of one's own self, then consciousness of the
   distinction between right and wrong (Ro 2:15) with approval or
   disapproval. But the conscience is not an infallible guide and acts
   according to the light that it has (1Co 8:7, 10; 1Pe 2:19). The
   conscience can be contaminated (Heb 10:22, evil [poneras]. All this and
   more must be borne in mind in trying to understand Paul's description
   of his motives as a persecutor. Alleviation of his guilt comes thereby,
   but not removal of guilt as he himself felt (1Ti 1:13-16). He means to
   say to the Sanhedrin that he persecuted Christians as a conscientious
   (though mistaken) Jew (Pharisee) just as he followed his conscience in
   turning from Judaism to Christianity. It is a pointed disclaimer
   against the charge that he is a renegade Jew, an opposer of the law,
   the people, the temple. Paul addresses the Sanhedrin as an equal and
   has no "apologies" (in our sense) to make for his career as a whole.
   The golden thread of consistency runs through, as a good citizen in
   God's commonwealth. He had the consolation of a good conscience (1Pe
   3:16). The word does not occur in the Gospels and chiefly in Paul's
   Epistles, but we see it at work in Joh 8:9 (the interpolation
   7:53-8:11).

   23:2 Ananias [Hananias]. Not the one in Lu 3:2; Joh 18:13; Ac 4:7, but
   the son of Nebedaeus, nominated high priest by Herod, King of Chalcis,
   A.D. 48 and till A.D. 59. He was called to Rome A.D. 52 to answer "a
   charge of rapine and cruelty made against him by the Samaritans, but
   honourably acquitted" (Page). Though high priest, he was a man of bad
   character. Them that stood by him [tois parestOsin autOi]. Dative case
   of second perfect participle of [paristemi], to place, and
   intransitive. See the same form in verse 4 [parestOtes]. To smite him
   on the mouth [tuptein autou to stoma]. See on 12:45; 18:17. Cf. the
   treatment of Jesus (Joh 18:22). Ananias was provoked by Paul's
   self-assertion while on trial before his judges. "The act was illegal
   and peculiarly offensive to a Jew at the hands of a Jew" (Knowling).
   More self-control might have served Paul better. Smiting the mouth or
   cheek is a peculiarly irritating offence and one not uncommon among the
   Jews and this fact gives point to the command of Jesus to turn the
   other check (Lu 6:29 where [tuptO] is also used).

   23:3 Thou whited wall [toiche kekoniamene]. Perfect passive participle
   of [koniaO] (from [konia], dust or lime). The same word used in Mt
   23:27 for "whited sepulchres" [taphoi kekoniamenoi] which see. It is a
   picturesque way of calling Ananias a hypocrite, undoubtedly true, but
   not a particularly tactful thing for a prisoner to say to his judge,
   not to say Jewish high priest. Besides, Paul had hurled back at him the
   word [tuptein] (smite) in his command, putting it first in the sentence
   [tuptein se mellei ho theos] in strong emphasis. Clearly Paul felt that
   he, not Ananias, was living as a good citizen in God's commonwealth.
   And sittest thou to judge me? [Kai su kathei krinOn me?] Literally,
   "And thou (being what thou art) art sitting [kathei], second person
   singular middle of [kathemai], late form for [kathesai], the
   uncontracted form) judging me." Cf. Lu 22:30. [Kai su] at the beginning
   of a question expresses indignation. Contrary to the law [paranomOn].
   Present active participle of [paranomeO], old verb to act contrary to
   the law, here alone in the N.T., "acting contrary to the law."

   23:4 Of God [tou theou]. As God's representative in spite of his bad
   character (De 17:8f.). Here was a charge of irreverence, to say the
   least. The office called for respect.

   23:5 I wist not [ouk eidein]. Second past perfect of [oida] used as an
   imperfect. The Greek naturally means that Paul did not know that it was
   the high priest who gave the order to smite his mouth. If this view is
   taken, several things may be said by way of explanation. The high
   priest may not have had on his official dress as the meeting was called
   hurriedly by Lysias. Paul had been away so long that he may not have
   known Ananias on sight. And then Paul may have had poor eyesight or the
   high priest may not have been sitting in the official seat. Another way
   of explaining it is to say that Paul was so indignant, even angry, at
   the command that he spoke without considering who it was that gave the
   order. The Greek allows this idea also. At any rate Paul at once
   recognizes the justice of the point made against him. He had been
   guilty of irreverence against the office of high priest as the passage
   from Ex 22:18 (LXX) shows and confesses his fault, but the rebuke was
   deserved. Jesus did not threaten (1Pe 2:23) when smitten on the cheek
   (Joh 18:22), but he did protest against the act and did not turn the
   other cheek.

   23:6 But when Paul perceived [gnous de ho Paulos]. Perceiving (second
   aorist ingressive of [ginOskO]. Paul quickly saw that his cause was
   ruined before the Sanhedrin by his unwitting attack on the high priest.
   It was impossible to get a fair hearing. Hence, Vincent says, "Paul,
   with great tact, seeks to bring the two parties of the council into
   collision with each other." So Alford argues with the motto "divide and
   conquer." Farrar condemns Paul and takes 24:21 as a confession of error
   here, but that is reading into Paul's word about the resurrection more
   than he says. Page considers Luke's report meagre and unsatisfactory.
   Rackham thinks that the trial was already started and that Paul
   repeated part of his speech of the day before when "the Sadducees
   received his words with ostentatious scepticism and ridicule: this
   provoked counter-expressions of sympathy and credulity among the
   Pharisees." But all this is inference. We do not have to adopt the
   Jesuitical principle that the end justifies the means in order to see
   shrewdness and hard sense in what Paul said and did. Paul knew, of
   course, that the Sanhedrin was nearly evenly divided between Pharisees
   and Sadducees, for he himself had been a Pharisee. I am a Pharisee, a
   son of Pharisees [EgO Pharisaios eimi huios PharisaiOn]. This was
   strictly true as we know from his Epistles (Php 3:5). Touching the hope
   and resurrection of the dead I am called in question [peri elpidos kai
   anastaseOs nekrOn krinomai]. This was true also and this is the point
   that Paul mentions in 24:21. His failure to mention again the fact that
   he was a Pharisee throws no discredit on Luke's report here. The chief
   point of difference between Pharisees and Sadducees was precisely this
   matter of the resurrection. And this was Paul's cardinal doctrine as a
   Christian minister. It was this fact that convinced him that Jesus was
   the Messiah and was "the very centre of his faith" (Page) and of his
   preaching. It was not a mere trick for Paul to proclaim this fact here
   and so divide the Sanhedrin. As a matter of fact, the Pharisees held
   aloof when the Sadducees persecuted Peter and the other apostles for
   preaching resurrection in the case of Jesus and even Gamaliel threw
   cold water on the effort to punish them for it (Ac 5:34-39). So then
   Paul was really recurring to the original cleavage on this point and
   was able to score a point against the Sadducees as Gamaliel, his great
   teacher, had done before him. Besides, "Paul and Pharisaism seem to us
   such opposite ideas that we often forget that to Paul Christianity was
   the natural development of Judaism" (Page). Paul shows this in Ga 3; Ro
   9-11.

   23:7 When he had so said [touto autou lalountos]. Genitive absolute of
   present participle (Westcott and Hort) rather than aorist [eipontos].
   While he was saying this. A dissension [stasis]. This old word for
   standing or station (Heb 9:8) from [histemi], to place, we have seen
   already to mean insurrection (Ac 19:40 which see). Here it is strife as
   in 15:2. Was divided [eschisthe]. See on 14:4.

   23:8 There is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit [me einai
   anastasin mete aggelon mete pneuma]. Infinitive with negative [me] in
   indirect assertion. These points constitute the chief doctrinal
   differences between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Both [amphotera].
   Here used though three items of belief are mentioned as in 19:16 where
   the seven sons of Sceva are thus described. This idiom is common enough
   in papyri and Byzantine Greek (Robertson, Grammar, p. 745).

   23:9 Strove [diemachonto]. Imperfect middle of [diamachomai], old Attic
   verb, to fight it out (between, back and forth, fiercely). Here only in
   the N.T. It was a lively scrap and Luke pictures it as going on. The
   Pharisees definitely take Paul's side. And what if a spirit hath spoken
   to him or an angel? [ei de pneuma elalesen autOi e aggelos?]. This is
   aposiopesis, not uncommon in the N.T., as in Lu 13:9; Joh 6:62
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1203). See one also in Ex 32:32.

   23:10 When there arose a great dissension [polles tes ginomenes
   staseOs]. Present middle participle (genitive absolute). Literally,
   "dissension becoming much." Lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them
   [me diaspasthei ho Paulos]. First aorist passive subjunctive of
   [diaspaO], to draw in two, to tear in pieces, old verb, in the N.T.
   only here and Mr 5:4 of tearing chains in two. The subjunctive with
   [me] is the common construction after a verb of fearing (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 995). The soldiers [to strateuma]. The army, the band of
   soldiers and so in verse 27. To go down [kataban]. Second aorist active
   participle of [katabainO], having gone down. Take him by force
   [harpasai]. To seize. The soldiers were to seize and save Paul from the
   midst of [ek mesou] the rabbis or preachers (in their rage to get at
   each other). Paul was more of a puzzle to Lysias now than ever.

   23:11 The night following [tei epiousei nukti]. Locative case, on the
   next (following) night. The Lord [ho kurios]. Jesus. Paul never needed
   Jesus more than now. On a previous occasion the whole church prayed for
   Peter's release (12:5), but Paul clearly had no such grip on the church
   as that, though he had been kindly welcomed (21:18). In every crisis
   Jesus appears to him (cf. Ac 18:9). It looked dark for Paul till Jesus
   spoke. Once before in Jerusalem Jesus spoke words of cheer (22:18).
   Then he was told to leave Jerusalem. Now he is to have "cheer" or
   "courage" [tharsei]. Jesus used this very word to others (Mt 9:2, 22;
   Mr 10:49). It is a brave word. Thou hast testified [diemarturO]. First
   aorist middle indicative second person singular of [diamarturomai],
   strong word (see on 22:18). Must thou [se dei]. That is the needed word
   and on this Paul leans. His hopes (19:21) of going to Rome will not be
   in vain. He can bide Christ's time now. And Jesus has approved his
   witness in Jerusalem.

   23:12 Banded together [poiesantes sustrophen]. See on 19:40 (riot), but
   here conspiracy, secret combination, binding together like twisted
   cords. Bound themselves under a curse [anethematisan heautous]. First
   aorist active indicative of [anathematizO], a late word, said by Cremer
   and Thayer to be wholly Biblical or ecclesiastical. But Deissmann
   (Light from the Ancient East, p. 95) quotes several examples of the
   verb in an Attic cursing tablet from Megara of the first or second
   century A.D. This proof shows that the word, as well as [anathema]
   (substantive) from which the verb is derived, was employed by pagans as
   well as by Jews. Deissmann suggests that Greek Jews like the seven sons
   of Sceva may have been the first to coin it. It occurs in the LXX as
   well as Mr 14:71 (which see and Luke 21:5); Ac 23:12, 14, 21. They
   placed themselves under an anathema or curse, devoted themselves to God
   (cf. Le 27:28f.; 1Co 16:22). Drink [pein=piein]. Second aorist active
   infinitive of [pinO]. For this shortened form see Robertson, Grammar,
   p. 343. Till they had killed [heOs hou apokteinOsin]. First aorist
   active subjunctive of [apokteinO], common verb. No reason to translate
   "had killed," simply "till they should kill," the aorist merely
   punctiliar action, the subjunctive retained instead of the optative for
   vividness as usual in the Koine (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 974-6). Same
   construction in verse 14. King Saul took an "anathema" that imperilled
   Jonathan (1Sa 14:24). Perhaps the forty felt that the rabbis could find
   some way to absolve the curse if they failed. See this verse repeated
   in verse 21.

   23:13 More than forty [pleious tesserakonta]. Without "than" [e] as in
   verse 21; 24:11 and often in the ancient Greek. Conspiracy
   [sunOmosian]. Old word from [sunomnumi], to swear together. Only here
   in the N.T.

   23:14 Came to the chief priests and the elders [proselthontes tois
   archiereusin kai tois presbuterois]. The Sanhedrin, just as Judas did
   (Lu 22:4). With a great curse [anathemati]. This use of the same word
   as the verb repeated in the instrumental case is in imitation of the
   Hebrew absolute infinitive and common in the LXX, the very idiom and
   words of De 13:15; 20:17, an example of translation Greek, though found
   in other languages (Robertson, Grammar, p. 531). See on Lu 21:5 for the
   distinction between [anathema] and [anathema]. Jesus had foretold:
   "Whoso killeth you will think that he doeth God service" (Joh 16:2).

   23:15 Ye [humeis]. Emphatic. Signify [emphanisate]. First aorist active
   imperative of [emphanizO]. Make plain from [emphanes], chiefly in Acts.
   Repeated in verse 22. The authority is with the chiliarch not with the
   Sanhedrin, but he had appealed to the Sanhedrin for advice. As though
   ye would judge of his case more exactly [hOs mellontas diaginOskein
   akribesteron ta peri autou]. [HOs] with the participle gives the
   alleged reason as here. So also in verse 20. [DiagnoskO], old verb to
   distinguish accurately, only here in N.T. and 24:22. Or ever come near
   [pro tou eggisai auton]. "Before the coming near as to him." [Pro] and
   the genitive of the articular infinitive of [eggizO] with accusative of
   general reference. We are ready to slay him [hetoimoi esmen tou anelein
   auton]. Genitive of purpose of the articular infinitive after the
   adjective [hetoimoi] (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1061). [Anelein], second
   aorist active of [anaireO].

   23:16 Their lying in wait [ten enedran]. Old word from [en] (in) and
   [hedra] (seat), ambush. In N.T. only here and 25:3. Accusative object
   of [akousas]. He came [paragenomenos]. Second aorist middle participle
   of [paraginomai]. It may mean, "having come upon them" and so discount
   their plot, a graphic touch. Vincent thinks that some Pharisee, since
   Paul was a Pharisee and so a member of the "guild," told his nephew of
   the plot. Perhaps, and perhaps not. Told Paul [apeggeilen tOi PaulOi].
   This nephew is not known otherwise. He may be a student here from
   Tarsus as Paul once was. Anyhow he knows what to do when he catches on
   to the conspirators. He had enough address to get into the barracks
   where Paul was. He ran the risk of death if discovered.

   23:17 Called unto him [proskalesamenos]. First aorist participle
   indirect middle, calling to himself. Paul laid his plans as
   energetically as if Jesus had not promised that he would see Rome
   (23:11). Bring [apage]. "Take away."

   23:18 Paul the prisoner [ho desmios Paulos]. Bound [desmios] to a
   soldier, but not with two chains (21:33), and with some freedom to see
   his friends as later (28:16), in military custody (custodia militaris).
   This was better than custodia publica (public custody), the common
   prison, but more confining. Who hath something to say to thee [echonta
   ti lalesai soi]. Same idiom as in verse 17, 19, but [lalesai] here
   instead of [apaggeilai].

   23:19 Took him by the hand [epilabomenos tes cheiros autou]. Kindly
   touch in Lysias, ut fiduciam adolescentis confirmaret (Bengel). Note
   genitive with the second aorist middle (indirect, to himself) of
   [epilambanO] as in Lu 8:54 with [kratesas] which see. How old the young
   man [neanias] was we do not know, but it is the very word used of Paul
   in 7:58 when he helped in the killing of Stephen, a young man in the
   twenties probably. See also 20:9 of Eutychus. He is termed [neaniskos]
   in verse 22. Asked him privately [kat' idian epunthaneto]. Imperfect
   middle, began to ask (inchoative).

   23:20 The Jews [hoi Ioudaioi]. As if the whole nation was in the
   conspiracy and so in verse 12. The conspirators may have belonged to
   the Zealots, but clearly they represented the state of Jewish feeling
   toward Paul in Jerusalem. Have agreed [sunethento]. Second aorist
   middle indicative of [suntithemi], old verb to join together, to agree.
   Already this form in Lu 22:5 which see. See also Joh 9:22; Ac 24:9. To
   bring down [hopOs katagageis]. Very words of the conspirators in verse
   15 as if the young man overheard. Second aorist active subjunctive of
   [katagO] with [hopOs] in final clause, still used, but nothing like so
   common as [hina] though again in verse 23 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 985).
   As though thou wouldest inquire [hOs mellOn punthanesthai]. Just as in
   verse 15 except that here [mellOn] refers to Lysias instead of to the
   conspirators as in verse 15. The singular is used by the youth out of
   deference to the authority of Lysias and so modifies a bit the scheming
   of the conspirators, not "absurd" as Page holds.

   23:21 Do not therefore yield unto them [Su oun me peistheis autois].
   First aorist passive subjunctive of [peithO], common verb, here to be
   persuaded by, to listen to, to obey, to yield to. With negative and
   rightly. Do not yield to them (dative) at all. On the aorist
   subjunctive with [me] in prohibitions against committing an act see
   Robertson, Grammar, pp. 851-4. For there lie in wait [enedreuousin
   gar]. Present active indicative of [enedreuO], old verb from [enedra]
   (verse 16), in the N.T. only here and Lu 11:54 which see. Till they
   have slain him [heOs hou anelOsin auton]. Same idiom as in verse 12
   save that here we have [anelOsin] (second aorist active subjunctive)
   instead of [apokteinOsin] (another word for kill), "till they slay
   him." Looking for the promise from thee [prosdechomenoi ten apo sou
   epaggelian]. This item is all that is needed to put the scheme through,
   the young man shrewdly adds.

   23:22 Tell no man [medeni eklalesai]. Indirect command (oratio obliqua)
   after [paraggeilas] (charging) with first aorist active infinitive of
   [eklaleO] (in ancient Greek, but here only in N.T.), but construction
   changed to direct in rest of the sentence (oratio recta) as in 1:4,
   "that thou hast signified these things to me" [hoti tauta enephanisas
   pros eme]. Same verb here as in verse 15. This change is common in the
   N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1047).

   23:23 Two [tinas duo]. "Some two" as in Lu 7:19, indicating (Page) that
   they were not specially chosen. Soldiers [stratiOtas], horsemen
   [hippeis], spearmen [dexiolabous]. The three varieties of troops in a
   Roman army like the cohort of Lysias (Page). The [stratiOtai] were the
   heavy-armed legionaries, the [hippeis] belonged to every legion, the
   [dexiolaboi] were light-armed supplementary troops who carried a lance
   in the right hand [dexios], right, [lambanO], to take). Vulgate,
   lancearios. At the third hour of the night [apo trites hOras tes
   nuktos]. About nine in the evening.

   23:24 Provide beasts [ktene parastesai]. Change from direct to indirect
   discourse just the opposite of that in verse 22. Beasts [ktene]. For
   riding as here or for baggage. See on Lu 10:34. Asses or horses, but
   not war-horses. Since Paul was chained to a soldier, another animal
   would be required for baggage. It was also seventy miles and a change
   of horses might be needed. The extreme precaution of Lysias is
   explained in some Latin MSS. as due to fear of a night attack with the
   result that he might be accused to Felix of bribery. Luke also probably
   accompanied Paul. To bring safe [hina diasOsOsin]. Final clause with
   [hina] and the first aorist active subjunctive of [diasOzO], old verb,
   to save through [dia] to a finish. Eight times in the N.T. (Mt 14:36;
   Lu 7:3; Ac 23:24; 27:43,44; 28:1,4; 1Pe 3:20). Unto Felix the governor
   [pros Phelika ton hegemona]. Felix was a brother of Pallas, the
   notorious favourite of Claudius. Both had been slaves and were now
   freedmen. Felix was made procurator of Judea by Claudius A.D. 52. He
   held the position till Festus succeeded him after complaints by the
   Jews to Nero. He married Drusilla the daughter of Herod Agrippa I with
   the hope of winning the favour of the Jews. He was one of the most
   depraved men of his time. Tacitus says of him that "with all cruelty
   and lust he exercised the power of a king with the spirit of a slave."
   The term "governor" [hegemOn] means "leader" from [hegeomai], to lead,
   and was applied to leaders of all sorts (emperors, kings, procurators).
   In the N.T. it is used of Pilate (Mt 27:2), of Felix, (Ac 23:24,26,33;
   24:1), of Festus (26:30).

   23:25 And he wrote [grapsas]. First aorist active participle of
   [graphO], agreeing with the subject (Lysias) of [eipen] (said) back in
   verse 23 (beginning). After this form [echousan ton tupon touton].
   Textus Receptus has [periechousan]. The use of [tupon] (type or form)
   like exemplum in Latin (Page who quotes Cicero Ad Att. IX. 6. 3) may
   give merely the purport or substantial contents of the letter. But
   there is no reason for thinking that it is not a genuine copy since the
   letter may have been read in open court before Felix, and Luke was
   probably with Paul. The Roman law required that a subordinate officer
   like Lysias in reporting a case to his superior should send a written
   statement of the case and it was termed elogium. A copy of the letter
   may have been given Paul after his appeal to Caesar. It was probably
   written in Latin. The letter is a "dexterous mixture of truth and
   falsehood" (Furneaux) with the stamp of genuineness. It puts things in
   a favourable light for Lysias and makes no mention of his order to
   scourge Paul.

   23:26 Most excellent [kratistOi]. See on Lu 1:3 to Theophilus though
   not in Ac 1:1. It is usual in addressing men of rank as here, like our
   "Your Excellency" in 24:3 and Paul uses it to Festus in 26:25. Greeting
   [chairein]. Absolute infinitive with independent or absolute nominative
   [Klaudios Lusias] as is used in letters (Ac 15:23; Jas 1:1) and in
   countless papyri (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1092).

   23:27 Was seized [sullemphthenta]. First aorist passive participle of
   [sullambanO]. Rescued him having learned that he was a Roman [exeilamen
   mathOn hoti Romaios estin]. Wendt, Zoeckler, and Furneaux try to defend
   this record of two facts by Lysias in the wrong order from being an
   actual lie as Bengel rightly says. Lysias did rescue Paul and he did
   learn that he was a Roman, but in this order. He did not first learn
   that he was a Roman and then rescue him as his letter states. The use
   of the aorist participle [mathOn] from [manthanO] after the principal
   verb [exeilamen] (second aorist middle of [exaireO], to take out to
   oneself, to rescue) can be either simultaneous action or antecedent.
   There is in Greek no such idiom as the aorist participle of subsequent
   action (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1112-14). Lysias simply reversed the
   order of the facts and omitted the order for scourging Paul to put
   himself in proper light with Felix his superior officer and actually
   poses as the protector of a fellow Roman citizen.

   23:28 To know [epignOnai]. To know fully, [epi], second aorist active
   infinitive. They accused him [enekaloun autOi]. Imperfect active
   indicative, were accusing him (dative), repeating their charges.

   23:29 Concerning questions of their law [peri zetemata tou nomou
   autOn]. The very distinction drawn by Gallio in Corinth (Ac 18:14f.).
   On the word see on 15:2. But to have nothing laid to his charge worthy
   of death or of bonds [meden de axion thanatou e desmOn echonta
   enklema]. Literally, "having no accusation (or crime) worthy of death
   or of bonds." This phrase here only in the N.T. [Egklema] is old word
   for accusation or crime from [egkaleO] used in verse 28 and in the N.T.
   only here and 25:16. Lysias thus expresses the opinion that Paul ought
   to be set free and the lenient treatment that Paul received in Caesarea
   and Rome (first imprisonment) is probably due to this report of Lysias.
   Every Roman magistrate before whom Paul appears declares him innocent
   (Gallio, Lysias, Felix, Festus).

   23:30 When it was shown to me that there would be a plot [menutheises
   moi epiboules esesthai]. Two constructions combined; genitive absolute
   [menutheises epiboules], first aorist passive participle of [menuO] and
   future infinitive [esesthai] as if [epiboulen] accusative of general
   reference used) in indirect assertion after [menuO] (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 877). Charging his accusers also [paraggeilas kai tois
   kategorois]. First aorist active participle of [paraggellO] with which
   compare [mathOn] above (verse 27), not subsequent action. Dative case
   in [kategorois]. Before thee [epi sou]. Common idiom for "in the
   presence of" when before a judge (like Latin apud) as in 24:20, 21;
   25:26; 26:2. What happened to the forty conspirators we have no way of
   knowing. Neither they nor the Jews from Asia are heard of more during
   the long five years of Paul's imprisonment in Caesarea and Rome.

   23:31 As it was commanded them [kata to diatetagmenon autois].
   "According to that which was commanded them," perfect passive articular
   participle of [diatassO]. By night [dia nuktos]. Through the night,
   travelling by night forty miles from Jerusalem to Antipatris which was
   founded by Herod the Great and was on the road from Jerusalem to
   Caesarea, a hard night's ride.

   23:33 And they [hoitines]. Which very ones, the cavalry, the horsemen
   of verse 31. Delivered [anadontes]. Second aorist active participle of
   [anadidOmi], old verb to give up, to hand over, here only in the N.T.
   Presented Paul also [parestesan kai ton Paulon]. First aorist active
   (transitive, not second aorist intransitive) indicative of [paristemi],
   common verb to present or place beside. What would Paul's friends in
   Caesarea (Philip and his daughters) think of the prophecy of Agabus now
   so quickly come true.

   23:34 When he had read it [anagnous]. Second aorist active participle
   of [anaginOskO], to know again, to read. Of what province he was [ek
   poias eparcheias estin]. Tense of [estin] (is) retained in indirect
   question. [Poias] is strictly "of what kind of" province, whether
   senatorial or imperial. Cilicia, like Judea, was under the control of
   the propraetor of Syria (imperial province). Paul's arrest was in
   Jerusalem and so under the jurisdiction of Felix unless it was a matter
   of insurrection when he could appeal to the propraetor of Syria.

   23:35 I will hear thy cause [diakousomai]. "I will hear thee fully"
   [dia]. When--are come [paragenOntai]. Second aorist middle subjunctive
   of [paraginomai] with temporal conjunction [hotan], indefinite temporal
   clause of future time (Robertson, Grammar, p. 972), "whenever thine
   accusers come." In Herod's palace [en tOi praitOriOi]. The Latin word
   [praetorium]. The word meant the camp of the general, then the palace
   of the governor as here and Mt 27:27 which see, and then the camp of
   praetorian soldiers or rather the praetorian guard as in Php 1:13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 24

   24:1 And with an Orator, one Tertullus [kai rhetoros Tertullou tinos].
   A deputation of elders along with the high priest Ananias, not the
   whole Sanhedrin, but no hint of the forty conspirators or of the Asian
   Jews. The Sanhedrin had become divided so that now it is probably
   Ananias (mortally offended) and the Sadducees who take the lead in the
   prosecution of Paul. It is not clear whether after five days is from
   Paul's departure from Jerusalem or his arrival in Caesarea. If he spent
   nine days in Jerusalem, then the five days would be counted from then
   (verse 11). The employment of a Roman lawyer (Latin orator) was
   necessary since the Jews were not familiar with Roman legal procedure
   and it was the custom in the provinces (Cicero pro Cael. 30). The
   speech was probably in Latin which Paul may have understood also.
   [RhetOr] is a common old Greek word meaning a forensic orator or
   advocate but here only in the N.T. The Latin rhetor was a teacher of
   rhetoric, a very different thing. Tertullus is a diminutive of Tertius
   (Ro 16:22). Informed [enephanisan]. Same verb as in 23:15, 22, somewhat
   like our modern "indictment," certainly accusations "against Paul"
   [kata tou Paulou]. They were down on Paul and the hired barrister was
   prosecuting attorney. For the legal form see Oxyrhynchus Papyri, Vol.
   II., p. 162, line 19.

   24:2 When he (Paul) was called [klethentos autou]. Genitive absolute
   (as so often in Acts) with first aorist passive participle of [kaleO].
   Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace [polles eirenes tugchanontes
   dia sou]. Literally, obtaining much peace by thee. A regular piece of
   flattery, captatio benevolentiae, to ingratiate himself into the good
   graces of the governor. Felix had suppressed a riot, but Tacitus (Ann.
   XII. 54) declares that Felix secretly encouraged banditti and shared
   the plunder for which the Jews finally made complaint to Nero who
   recalled him. But it sounded well to praise Felix for keeping peace in
   his province, especially as Tertullus was going to accuse Paul of being
   a disturber of the peace. And that by thy providence [kai dia tes
   pronoias]. Forethought, old Greek word from [pronoos] [pronoeO] in 1Ti
   5:8; Ro 12:17; 2Co 8:21), in N.T. only here and Ro 13:14. "Providence"
   is Latin Providentia (foreseeing, provideo). Roman coins often have
   Providentia Caesaris. Post-Augustan Latin uses it of God (Deus). Evils
   are corrected for this nation [diorthOmatOn ginomenOn tOi ethnei
   toutOi]. Genitive absolute again, [ginomenOn], present middle
   participle describing the process of reform going on for this nation
   (dative case of personal interest). [DiorthOma] (from [diorthoO], to
   set right) occurs from Aristotle on of setting right broken limbs
   (Hippocrates) or reforms in law and life (Polybius, Plutarch). "Reform
   continually taking place for this nation." Felix the Reform Governor of
   Judea! It is like a campaign speech, but it doubtless pleased Felix.

   24:3 In all ways and in all places [pantei te kai pantachou]. [Pantei],
   old adverb of manner only here in N.T. [Pantachou] also old adverb of
   place, several times in N.T. But these adverbs most likely go with the
   preceding clause about "reforms" rather than as here translated with
   "we accept" [apodechometha]. But "with all gratitude" [meta pases
   eucharistias] does naturally go with [apodechometha].

   24:4 That I be not further tedious unto thee [hina me epi pleion se
   enkoptO]. Koine verb (Hippocrates, Polybius) to cut in on (or into), to
   cut off, to impede, to hinder. Our modern telephone and radio
   illustrate it well. In the N.T. (Ac 24:4; 1Th 2:18; Ga 5:7; Ro 15:22;
   1Pe 3:7). "That I may not cut in on or interrupt thee further [epi
   pleion] in thy reforms." Flattery still. Of thy clemency [tei sei
   epieikeiai]. Instrumental case of old word from [epieikes] and this
   from [epi] and [eikos] (reasonable, likely, fair). "Sweet
   Reasonableness" (Matthew Arnold), gentleness, fairness. An [epieikes]
   man is "one who makes reasonable concessions" (Aristotle, Eth. V. 10),
   while [dikaios] is "one who insists on his full rights" (Plato, Leg.
   757 D) as translated by Page. A few words [suntomOs]. Old adverb from
   [suntemnO], to cut together (short), abbreviate. Like [dia bracheOn] in
   Heb 13:22. In N.T. only here and Mr 16 (shorter conclusion).

   24:5 For we have found [heurontes gar]. Second aorist active participle
   of [heuriskO], but without a principal verb in the sentence. Probably
   we have here only a "summary of the charges against Paul" (Page). A
   pestilent fellow [loimon]. An old word for pest, plague, pestilence,
   Paul the pest. In N.T. only here and Lu 21:11 [loimoi kai limoi],
   pestilences and famines) which see. Latin pestis. Think of the greatest
   preacher of the ages being branded a pest by a contemporary hired
   lawyer. A mover of insurrections [kinounta staseis]. This was an
   offence against Roman law if it could be proven. "Plotted against at
   Damascus, plotted against at Jerusalem, expelled from Pisidian Antioch,
   stoned at Lystra, scourged and imprisoned at Philippi, accused of
   treason at Thessalonica, haled before the proconsul at Corinth, cause
   of a serious riot at Ephesus, and now finally of a riot at Jerusalem"
   (Furneaux). Specious proof could have been produced, but was not.
   Tertullus went on to other charges with which a Roman court had no
   concern (instance Gallio in Corinth). Throughout the world [kata ten
   oikoumenen]. The Roman inhabited earth [gen] as in 17:6. A ringleader
   of the sect of the Nazarenes [prOtostaten tes tOn NazOraiOn haireseOs].
   [PrOtostates] is an old word in common use from [prOtos] and [histemi],
   a front-rank man, a chief, a champion. Here only in the N.T. This
   charge is certainly true. About "sect" [hairesis] see on 5:17.
   [NazOraioi] here only in the plural in the N.T., elsewhere of Jesus (Mt
   2:23; 26:71; Lu 18:37; Joh 18:5,7; 19:19; Ac 2:22; 3:6; 4:10; 6:14;
   22:8; 26:9). The disciple is not above his Master. There was a sneer in
   the term as applied to Jesus and here to his followers.

   24:6 Assayed to profane [epeirasen bebelOsai]. A flat untruth, but the
   charge of the Asian Jews (21:28-30). Verbum optum ad calumnian
   (Bengel). We seized [ekratesamen]. As if the Sanhedrin had arrested
   Paul, Tertullus identifying himself with his clients. But it was the
   mob (21:28-31) that attacked Paul and Lysias who rescued him
   (21:32ff.).

   24:7 This whole verse with some words at the end of verse 6 and the
   beginning of verse 8 in the Textus Receptus ("And would have judged
   according to our law. But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and
   with great violence took him away out of our hands, commanding his
   accusers to come unto thee") is absent from Aleph A B H L P 61 (many
   other cursives) Sahidic Bohairic. It is beyond doubt a later addition
   to the incomplete report of the speech of Tertullus. As the Revised
   Version stands, verse 8 connects with verse 6. The motive of the added
   words is clearly to prejudice Felix against Lysias and they contradict
   the record in Ac 21. Furneaux holds them to be genuine and omitted
   because contradictory to Ac 21. More likely they are a clumsy attempt
   to complete the speech of Tertullus.

   24:8 From whom [par' hou]. Referring to Paul, but in the Textus
   Receptus referring to Lysias. By examining him thyself [autos
   anakrinas]. Not by torture, since Paul was a Roman citizen, but by
   hearing what Paul has to say in defence of himself. [AnakrinO] is to
   examine thoroughly up and down as in Lu 23:14.

   24:9 Joined in the charge [sunepethento]. Second aorist middle
   indicative of [sunepitithemi], old verb, double compound, to place upon
   [epi] together with [sun], to make a joint attack, here only in the
   N.T. Affirming [phaskontes]. Alleging, with the accusative in indirect
   assertion as in 25:19; Ro 1:22 (nominative with infinitive, Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 1038). Were so [houtOs echein], "held thus," common idiom.

   24:10 When the governor had beckoned to him [neusantos autOi tou
   hegemonos]. Genitive absolute again with first aorist active participle
   of [neuO], to give a nod, old word, in N.T. only here and Joh 13:24.
   "The governor nodding to him." Forasmuch as I know [epistamenos].
   Knowing, from [epistamai]. That thou hast been of many years a judge
   [ek pollOn etOn onta se kriten]. The participle in indirect assertion
   after [epistamenos] (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1041). Paul goes as far as
   he can in the way of a compliment. For seven years Felix has been
   governor, [onta] being a sort of progressive present participle with
   [ek pollOn etOn] (Robertson, Grammar, p. 892). Cheerfully [euthumOs].
   Old adverb from [euthumos] [eu] and [thumos], good spirit), here only
   in N.T. Make my defence [apologoumai]. Old and regular word for this
   idea as in Lu 21:14 which see.

   24:11 Seeing that thou canst take knowledge [dunamenou sou epignOnai].
   Genitive absolute again. The same word and form [epignOnai] used by
   Tertullus, if in Greek, in verse 8 to Felix. Paul takes it up and
   repeats it. Not more than twelve days [ou pleious hemerai dOdeka]. Here
   [e] (than) is absent without change of case to the ablative as usually
   happens. But this idiom is found in the Koine (Robertson, Grammar, p.
   666). Since [aph' hes]. Supply [hemeras], "from which day." To worship
   [proskunesOn]. One of the few examples of the future participle of
   purpose so common in the old Attic.

   24:12 Disputing [dialegomenon]. Simply conversing, discussing, arguing,
   and then disputing, common verb in old Greek and in N.T. (especially in
   Acts). Stirring up a crowd [epistasin poiounta ochlou]. [Epistasis] is
   a late word from [ephistemi], to make an onset or rush. Only twice in
   the N.T., 2Co 11:28 (the pressure or care of the churches) and here
   (making a rush of a crowd). The papyri give examples also for "onset."
   So Paul denies the two charges that were serious and the only one that
   concerned Roman law (insurrection).

   24:13 Prove [parastesai]. First aorist active infinitive of
   [paristemi], to place beside. They have made "charges," mere
   assertions. They have not backed up these charges with proof, "nor can
   they," says Paul. Now [nuni]. As if they had changed their charges from
   the cries of the mob in Jerusalem which is true. Paul has no hired
   lawyer to plead for him, but he has made a masterly plea for his
   freedom.

   24:14 I confess [homologO]. The only charge left was that of being a
   ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. This Paul frankly confesses is
   true. He uses the word in its full sense. He is "guilty" of that. After
   the Way [kata ten hodon]. This word Paul had already applied to
   Christianity (22:4). He prefers it to "sect" [hairesin] which means a
   choosing, then a division). Paul claims Christianity to be the real
   (whole, catholic) Judaism, not a "sect" of it. But he will show that
   Christianity is not a deviation from Judaism, but the fulfilment of it
   (Page) as he has already shown in Ga 3; Ro 9. So serve I the God of our
   fathers [houtOs latreuO tOi patrOiOi theOi]. Paul has not stretched the
   truth at all. He has confirmed the claim made before the Sanhedrin that
   he is a spiritual Pharisee in the truest sense (23:6). He reasserts his
   faith in all the law and the prophets, holding to the Messianic hope. A
   curious "heretic" surely! Which these themselves also look for [hen kai
   autoi houtoi prosdechontai]. Probably with a gesture towards his
   accusers. He does not treat them all as Sadducees. See Tit 2:13 for
   similar use of the verb [prosdechomenoi ten makarian elpida], looking
   for the happy hope).

   24:15 That there shall be a resurrection [anastasin mellein esesthai].
   Indirect assertion with infinitive and accusative of general reference
   [anastasin] after the word [elpida] (hope). The future infinitive
   [esesthai] after [mellein] is also according to rule, [mellO] being
   followed by either present, aorist, or future infinitive (Robertson,
   Grammar, pp. 870, 877, 878). Both of the just and the unjust [dikaiOn
   te kai adikOn]. Apparently at the same time as in Joh 5:29 (cf. Ac
   17:31f.). Gardner thinks that Luke here misrepresents Paul who held to
   no resurrection save for those "in Christ," a mistaken interpretation
   of Paul in my opinion. The Talmud teaches the resurrection of
   Israelites only, but Paul was more than a Pharisee.

   24:16 Herein [en toutOi]. His whole confession of belief in verses 14,
   15. Do I also exercise myself [kai autos askO]. "Do I also myself take
   exercise," take pains, labour, strive. Old word in Homer to work as raw
   materials, to adorn by art, then to drill. Our word ascetic comes from
   this root, one who seeks to gain piety by rules and severe hardship.
   Paul claims to be equal to his accusers in efforts to please God. Void
   of offence [aproskopon]. This word belongs to the papyri and N.T. (only
   in Paul), not in the ancient writers. The papyri examples (Moulton
   Milligan, Vocabulary) use the word to mean "free from hurt or harm." It
   is a privative and [proskoptO] (to cut or stumble against). Page likes
   "void of offence" since that can be either active "not stumbling" as in
   Php 1:10 or passive "not stumbled against" as in 1Co 10:32 (the first
   toward God and the second toward men), the only other N.T. examples.
   Hence the word here appears in both senses (the first towards God, the
   second towards men). Paul adds "alway" [dia pantos], a bold claim for a
   consistent aim in life. "Certainly his conscience acquitted him of
   having caused any offence to his countrymen" (Rackham). Furneaux thinks
   that it must have been wormwood and gall to Ananias to hear Paul repeat
   here the same words because of which he had ordered Paul to be smitten
   on the mouth (23:1f.).

   24:17 After many years [di' etOn pleionOn]. "At an interval [dia] of
   more [pleionOn] years" (than a few, one must add), not "after many
   years." If, as is likely Paul went up to Jerusalem in Ac 18:22, that
   was some five years ago and would justify "[pleionOn]" (several years
   ago or some years ago). To bring alms [eleemosunas poieson]. Another
   (see [proskunesOn] in verse 11) example of the future participle of
   purpose in the N.T. These "alms" (on [eleemosunas] see on Mt 6:1, 4; Ac
   10:2, common in Tobit and is in the papyri) were for the poor saints in
   Jerusalem (1Co 16:1-4; 2Co 8; 9; Ro 15:26) who were none the less Jews.
   "And offerings" [kai prosphoras]. The very word used in 21:26 of the
   offerings or sacrifices made by Paul for the four brethren and himself.
   It does not follow that it was Paul's original purpose to make these
   "offerings" before he came to Jerusalem (cf. 18:18). He came up to
   worship (verse 11) and to be present at Pentecost (20:16).

   24:18 Amidst which [en hail]. That is, "in which offerings" (in
   presenting which offerings, 21:27). They found me (my accusers here
   present, [heuron me], purified in the temple [hegnismenon en tOi
   hierOi]. Perfect passive participle of [hagnizO] (same verb in 21:24,
   26) state of completion of the Jewish sacrifices which had gone on for
   seven days (21:27), the very opposite of the charges made. With no
   crowd [ou meta ochlou]. "Not with a crowd" till the Asiatic Jews
   gathered one (21:27). Nor yet with tumult [oude meta thorubou]. They
   made the tumult (27:30), not Paul. Till they made the stir, all was
   quiet.

   24:19 But certain Jews from Asia [tines de apo tes Alias Ioudaioi]. No
   verb appears in the Greek for these words. Perhaps he meant to say that
   "certain Jews from Asia charged me with doing these things." Instead of
   saying that, Paul stops to explain that they are not here, a thoroughly
   Pauline anacoluthon (2Co 7:5) as in 26:9. "The passage as it stands is
   instinct with life, and seems to exhibit the abruptness so
   characteristic of the Pauline Epistles" (Page). Who ought to have been
   here before thee [hous edei epi sou pareinai]. This use of [epi] with
   genitive of the person is common. The imperfect indicative with verbs
   of necessity and obligation to express failure to live up to it is
   common in Greek (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 919-21). "The accusers who
   were present had not witnessed the alleged offence: those who could
   have given evidence at first-hand were not present" (Furneaux). There
   was no case in a Roman court. These Asiatic Jews are never heard of
   after the riot, though they almost succeeded in killing Paul then. If
   they had aught against me [ei ti echoien pros eme]. A condition of the
   fourth class or undetermined with less likelihood of being determined
   [ei] with the optative, Robertson, Grammar, p. 1021). This is a "mixed
   condition" (op.cit., p. 1022) with a conclusion of the second class.

   24:20 These men themselves [autoi houtoi]. Since the Asiatic Jews are
   not present and these men are. Wrong doing [adikema]. Or misdeed. Old
   word from [adikeO], to do wrong. In the N.T. only here and Ac 18:14; Re
   18:5. Paul uses "[adikema]" from the standpoint of his accusers. "To a
   less sensitive conscience his action before the Sanhedrin would have
   seemed venial enough" (Furneaux). When I stood [stantos mou]. Genitive
   absolute, second aorist active participle of [histemi] (intransitive),
   "when I took my stand." Before the council [epi tou sunedriou]. Same
   use of [epi] with genitive as in verse 19.

   24:21 Except it be [e]. Literally, "than," but after interrogative [ti
   = ti allo] "what else than." For this one voice [peri mias tautes
   phOnes]. The normal Greek idiom with the attributive use of [houtos]
   calls for the article before [mias], though some inscriptions show it
   as here (Robertson, Grammar, p. 702). That [hes]. Genitive of the
   relative attracted to the case of the antecedent phOnes. I cried
   [ekekraxa]. Reduplicated aorist as is usual with this verb in the LXX
   (Jud 3:15). Robertson, Grammar, p. 348. Touching [peri]. Concerning
   (around, about). I am called in question [krinomai]. As in 23:6. Before
   you [eph' humOn]. Same idiom as in verses 19, 20.

   24:22 Having more exact knowledge [akribesteron eidOs]. "Knowing"
   (second perfect active participle of [oida] "more accurately"
   (comparative of adverb [akribOs]. More accurately than what? Than the
   Sanhedrin supposed he had "concerning the Way" [ta peri tes hodou], the
   things concerning the Way, common in Acts for Christianity). How Felix
   had gained this knowledge of Christianity is not stated. Philip the
   Evangelist lived here in Caesarea and there was a church also. Drusilla
   was a Jewess and may have told him something. Besides, it is wholly
   possible that Felix knew of the decision of Gallio in Corinth that
   Christianity was a religio licita as a form of Judaism. As a Roman
   official he knew perfectly well that the Sanhedrin with the help of
   Tertullus had failed utterly to make out a case against Paul. He could
   have released Paul and probably would have done so but for fear of
   offending the Jews whose ruler he was and the hope that Paul (note
   "alms" in verse 17) might offer him bribes for his liberty. Deferred
   them [anebaleto autous]. Second aorist middle indicative of [anaballO],
   old verb (only here in N.T.) to throw or toss up, to put back or off,
   in middle to put off from one, to delay, to adjourn. Felix adjourned
   the case without a decision under a plausible pretext, that he required
   the presence of Lysias in person, which was not the case. Lysias had
   already said that Paul was innocent and was never summoned to Caesarea,
   so far as we know. Since Paul was a Roman citizen, Lysias could have
   thrown some light on the riot, if he had any. Shall come down
   [katabei]. Second aorist active subjunctive of [katabainO]. I will
   determine your matter [diagnOsomai ta kath' humas]. Future middle of
   [diaginOskO], old and common verb to know accurately or thoroughly
   [dia]. In the N.T. only here (legal sense) and 23:15. "The things
   according to you" (plural, the matters between Paul and the Sanhedrin).

   24:23 And should have indulgence [echein te anesin]. From [aniemi], to
   let loose, release, relax. Old word, in the N.T. only here and 2Th 1:7;
   2Co 2:13; 7:5; 8:13. It is the opposite of strict confinement, though
   under guard, "kept in charge" [tereisthai]. Forbid [kOluein]. To hinder
   "no one of his friends" [medena tOn idiOn]. No one of Paul's "own" (cf.
   4:23; Joh 1:11) or intimates. Of these we know the names of Luke,
   Aristarchus, Trophimus, Philip the Evangelist.

   24:24 With Drusilla his wife [sun Drousillei tei idiai gunaiki]. Felix
   had induced her to leave her former husband Aziz, King of Emesa. She
   was one of three daughters of Herod Agrippa I (Drusilla, Mariamne,
   Bernice). Her father murdered James, her great-uncle Herod Antipas slew
   John the Baptist, her great-grandfather (Herod the Great) killed the
   babes of Bethlehem. Perhaps the mention of Drusilla as "his own wife"
   is to show that it was not a formal trial on this occasion. Page thinks
   that she was responsible for the interview because of her curiosity to
   hear Paul. Sent for [metepempsato]. First aorist middle of [metapempO]
   as usual (Ac 10:5).

   24:25 Was terrified [emphobos genomenos]. Ingressive aorist middle of
   [ginomai], "becoming terrified." [Emphobos] [en] and [phobos] old word,
   in the N.T. only Lu 24:5; Ac 10:5; 24:25; Re 11:13. Paul turned the
   tables completely around and expounded "the faith in Christ Jesus" as
   it applied to Felix and Drusilla and discoursed [dialegomenou autou],
   genitive absolute) concerning "righteousness" [dikaiosunes] which they
   did not possess, "self-control" or temperance [egkrateias] which they
   did not exhibit, and "the judgment to come" [tou krimatos tou
   mellontos] which was certain to overtake them. Felix was brought under
   conviction, but apparently not Drusilla. Like another Herodias her
   resentment was to be feared (Knowling). Go thy way for this time [to
   nun echon poreuou]. The ancient Greek has this use of [to nun echon]
   (Tobit 7:11) in the accusative of time, "as for the present or holding
   the now." When I have a convenient season [kairon metalabOn]. Second
   aorist active participle of the old verb [metalambanO], to find a share
   in, to obtain. It was his "excuse" for dodging the personal turn that
   Paul had given.

   24:26 He hoped withal [hama kai elpizOn]. "At the same time also
   hoping." Paul had mentioned the "alms" (24:17) and that excited the
   avarice of Felix for "money" [chremata]. Roman law demanded exile and
   confiscation for a magistrate who accepted bribes, but it was lax in
   the provinces. Felix had doubtless received them before. Josephus (Ant.
   XX. 8, 9) represents Felix as greedy for money. The oftener
   [puknoteron]. Comparative adverb of [puknos], old word, in N.T. only
   here and Lu 5:33 which see and 1Ti 5:23. Kin to [pugme] (Mr 7:3) which
   see from [pukO], thick, dense, compact. Paul kept on not offering a
   bribe, but Felix continued to have hopes (present tense [elpizOn], kept
   on sending for him (present tense [metapempomenos], and kept on
   communing (imperfect active [hOmilei] from [homileO], old word as in Ac
   20:11; Lu 24:14, which see, only N.T. examples of this word). But he
   was doomed to disappointment. He was never terrified again.

   24:27 But when two years were fulfilled [dietias de plerOtheises].
   Genitive absolute first aorist passive of [pleroO], common verb to fill
   full. [Dietia], late word in LXX and Philo, common in the papyri, in
   N.T. only here and Ac 28:30. Compound of [dia], two [duo, dis] and
   [etos], year. So Paul lingered on in prison in Caesarea, waiting for
   the second hearing under Felix which never came. Caesarea now became
   the compulsory headquarters of Paul for two years. With all his travels
   Paul spent several years each at Tarsus, Antioch, Corinth, Ephesus,
   though not as a prisoner unless that was true part of the time at
   Ephesus for which there is some evidence though not of a convincing
   kind. We do not know that Luke remained in Caesarea all this time. In
   all probability he came and went with frequent visits with Philip the
   Evangelist. It was probably during this period that Luke secured the
   material for his Gospel and wrote part or all of it before going to
   Rome. He had ample opportunity to examine the eyewitnesses who heard
   Jesus and the first attempts at writing including the Gospel of Mark
   (Lu 1:1-4). Was succeeded by [elaben diadochon]. Literally, "received
   as successor." [Diadochos] is an old word from [diadechomai], to
   receive in succession [dia, duo], two) and occurs here alone in the
   N.T. Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 115) gives papyri examples where [hoi
   diadochoi] means "higher officials at the court of the Ptolemies,"
   probably "deputies," a usage growing out of the "successors" of
   Alexander the Great (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary), though here
   the original notion of "successor" occurs (cf. Josephus, Ant. XX. 8,
   9). Luke does not tell why Felix "received" a successor. The
   explanation is that during these two years the Jews and the Gentiles
   had an open fight in the market-place in Caesarea. Felix put the
   soldiers on the mob and many Jews were killed. The Jews made formal
   complaint to the Emperor with the result that Felix was recalled and
   Porcius Festus sent in his stead. Porcius Festus [Porkion Pheston]. We
   know very little about this man. He is usually considered a worthier
   man than Felix, but Paul fared no better at his hands and he exhibits
   the same insincerity and eagerness to please the Jews. Josephus (Ant.
   XX. 8, 9) says that "Porcius Festus was sent as a successor to Felix."
   The precise year when this change occurred is not clear. Albinus
   succeeded Festus by A.D. 62, so that it is probable that Festus came
   A.D. 58 (or 59). Death cut short his career in a couple of years though
   he did more than Felix to rid the country of robbers and sicarii. Some
   scholars argue for an earlier date for the recall of Felix. Nero became
   Emperor Oct. 13, A.D. 54. Poppaea, his Jewish mistress and finally
   wife, may have had something to do with the recall of Felix at the
   request of the Jews. Desiring to gain favour with the Jews [thelOn te
   charita katathesthai tois Ioudaiois]. Reason for his conduct. Note
   second aorist (ingressive) middle infinitive [katathesthai] from
   [katatithemi], old verb to place down, to make a deposit, to deposit a
   favour with, to do something to win favour. Only here and 25:9 in N.T.,
   though in some MSS. in Mr 15:46. It is a banking figure. Left Paul in
   bonds [katelipe ton Paulon dedemenon]. Effective aorist active
   indicative of [kataleipO], to leave behind. Paul "in bonds"
   [dedemenon], perfect passive participle of [deO], to bind) was the
   "deposit" [katathesthai] for their favour. Codex Bezae adds that Felix
   left Paul in custody "because of Drusilla" [dia Drousillan]. She
   disliked Paul as much as Herodias did John the Baptist. So Pilate
   surrendered to the Jews about the death of Jesus when they threatened
   to report him to Caesar. Some critics would date the third group of
   Paul's Epistles (Philippians, Philemon, Colossians, Ephesians) to the
   imprisonment here in Caesarea, some even to one in Ephesus. But the
   arguments for either of these two views are more specious than
   convincing. Furneaux would even put 2Ti 4:9-22 here in spite of the
   flat contradiction with Ac 21:29 about Trophimus being in Jerusalem
   instead of Miletus (2Ti 4:20), a "mistake" which he attributes to Luke!
   That sort of criticism can prove anything.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 25

   25:1 Having come into the province [epibas tei eparcheiai]. Second
   aorist active participle of [epibainO], to set foot upon. Literally,
   "Having set foot upon his province." [Eparcheia] is a late word for
   province, in N.T. only here and 23:34. Judea was not strictly a
   province, but a department (Page) of the province of Syria which was
   under a propraetor [legatus Caesaris] while Judea was under a
   procurator [epitropos]. After three days [meta treis hemeras]. So in Ac
   28:17 in Rome. That is on the third day, with a day of rest in between.
   Precisely the language used of the resurrection of Jesus "after three
   days" = "on the third day." So by common usage then and now.

   25:2 The principal men [hoi prOtoi]. The first men, the leading men of
   the city, besides the chief priests. In verse 15 we have "the chief
   priests and the elders." These chief men among the Jews would desire to
   pay their respects to the new Procurator on his first visit to
   Jerusalem. There was another high priest now, Ishmael in place of
   Ananias. Informed him against Paul [enephanisan autOi kata tou Paulou].
   "This renewal of the charge after two years, on the very first
   opportunity, is a measure, not only of their unsleeping hatred, but of
   the importance which they attached to Paul's influence" (Furneaux).
   Besought [parekaloun]. Imperfect active, kept on beseeching as a
   special favour to the Jews.

   25:3 Asking favour against him [aitoumenoi charin kat' autou]. A favour
   to themselves (middle voice), not to Paul, but "against" [kat'], down,
   against) him. That he would send for [hopOs metapempsetai]. First
   aorist middle subjunctive of [metapempO] (see 24:24, 26) with final
   particle [hopOs] like [hina]. Aorist tense for single case. Laying wait
   [enedran poiountes]. See on 23:16 for the word [enedra]. Old idiom
   (Thucydides) for laying a plot or ambush as here. Only these two uses
   of [enedra] in N.T. Two years before the Sanhedrin had agreed to the
   plot of the forty conspirators. Now they propose one on their own
   initiative. On the way [kata ten hodon]. Down along, up and down along
   the way. Plenty of opportunity would occur between Caesarea and
   Jerusalem for ambush and surprise attacks.

   25:4 Howbeit [men oun]. No antithesis expressed, though Page considers
   [de] in verse 6 to be one. They probably argued that it was easier for
   one man (Paul) to come to Jerusalem than for many to go down there. But
   Festus was clearly suspicious ( verse 6) and was wholly within his
   rights to insist that they make their charges in Caesarea where he held
   court. Was kept in charge [tereisthai]. Present passive infinitive of
   [tereO] in indirect assertion. [Hoti] with finite verb is more common
   after [apokrinomai], but the infinitive with the accusative of general
   reference is proper as here (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1036). Shortly [en
   tachei]. In quickness, in speed. Old and common usage, seen already in
   Lu 18:8; Ac 12:7; 22:18. Festus is clearly within his rights again
   since his stay in Caesarea had been so brief. He did go down in "eight
   or ten days" (verse 6). Luke did not consider the matter important
   enough to be precise.

   25:5 Them therefore which are of power among you [hoi oun en humin
   dunatoi]. "The mighty ones among you," "the men of power" [dunatoi] and
   authority, "the first men," the Sanhedrin, in other words. Note change
   here by Luke from indirect discourse in verse 4, to direct in verse 5
   [phesin], says he). Go down with me [sunkatabantes]. Double compound
   [sun, kata] second aorist active participle of [sunkatabainO]. It was a
   fair proposal. If there is anything amiss in the man [ei ti estin en
   tOi andri atopon]. Condition of the first class, assuming that there is
   (to be courteous to them), but not committing himself on the merits of
   the case. [Atopon] is an old word, specially common in Plato, meaning
   "out of place." In N.T. only here and Lu 23:41 which see; Ac 28:6; 2Th
   3:2. Note present tense active voice of [kategoreitOsan] (imperative)
   of [kategoreO], repeat their accusations.

   25:6 On the morrow [tei epaurion]. Locative case of the article with
   [hemerai] understood [epaurion], adverb, tomorrow). Festus lost no time
   for the chief men had come down with him. Sat on the judgment seat
   [kathisas epi tou bematos]. A legal formality to give weight to the
   decision. Ingressive aorist active participle. For this use of [bema]
   for judgment seat see on Mt. 27:19; Joh 19:13; Acts 12:21; 18:12;
   25:10, 17. Same phrase repeated in 25:17. To be brought [achthenai].
   First aorist passive infinitive of [agO] after [ekeleusen] (commanded).
   Same words repeated in 25:17 by Festus.

   25:7 When he was come [paragenomenou autou]. Genitive absolute of
   common verb [paraginomai] (cf. 24:24). Which had come down [hoi
   katabebekotes]. Perfect active participle of [katabainO]. They had come
   down on purpose at the invitation of Festus (verse 5), and were now
   ready. Stood round about him [periestesan auton]. Second aorist
   (ingressive) active (intransitive) of [periistemi], old verb, "Took
   their stand around him," "periculum intentantes" (Bengel). Cf. Lu 23:10
   about Christ. They have no lawyer this time, but they mass their forces
   so as to impress Festus. Bringing against him [katapherontes]. Bearing
   down on. See on 20:9; 26:10, only N.T. examples of this ancient verb.
   Many and grievous charges [polla kai barea aitiOmata]. This word
   [aitiOma] for old form [aitiama] is found in one papyrus (Moulton and
   Milligan's Vocabulary) in sense of "blame." But the charges were no
   "heavier" than those made by Tertullus (24:5-8). Paul's reply proves
   this and they were also probably on court record (Furneaux). See this
   adjective [barus] (heavy) used with [lukoi] (wolves) in 20:29. Which
   they could not prove [ha ouk ischuon apodeixai]. Imperfect active of
   [ischuO], to have strength or power as in 19:16, 20. Repetition and
   reiteration and vehemence took the place of proof [apodeixai], first
   aorist active infinitive of [apodeiknumi], to show forth, old verb, in
   N.T. only here, Ac 2:22 which see and 1Co 4:9).

   25:8 While Paul said in his defence [tou Paulou apologoumenou].
   Genitive absolute again, present middle participle of [apologeomai],
   old verb to make defence as in 19:33; 24:10; 26:1, 2. The recitative
   [hoti] of the Greek before a direct quotation is not reproduced in
   English. Have I sinned at all [ti hemarton]. Constative aorist active
   indicative of [hamartanO], to miss, to sin. The [ti] is cognate
   accusative (or adverbial accusative). Either makes sense. Paul sums up
   the charges under the three items of law of the Jews, the temple, the
   Roman state (Caesar). This last was the one that would interest Festus
   and, if proved, would render Paul guilty of treason [majestas]. Nero
   was Emperor A.D. 54-68, the last of the emperors with any hereditary
   claim to the name "Caesar." Soon it became merely a title like Kaiser
   and Czar (modern derivatives). In Acts only "Caesar" and "Augustus" are
   employed for the Emperor, not "King" [Basileus] as from the time of
   Domitian. Paul's denial is complete and no proof had been presented.
   Luke was apparently present at the trial.

   25:9 Desiring to gain favour with the Jews [thelOn tois Ioudaiois
   charin katathesthai]. Precisely the expression used of Felix by Luke in
   24:27 which see. Festus, like Felix, falls a victim to fear of the
   Jews. Before me [ep' emou]. Same use of [epi] with the genitive as in
   23:30; 24:19, 21. Festus, seeing that it was unjust to condemn Paul and
   yet disadvantageous to absolve him (Blass), now makes the very proposal
   to Paul that the rulers had made to him in Jerusalem (verse 3). He
   added the words "[ep' emou]" (before me) as if to insure Paul of
   justice. If Festus was unwilling to give Paul justice in Caesarea where
   his regular court held forth, what assurance was there that Festus
   would give it to him at Jerusalem in the atmosphere of intense
   hostility to Paul? Only two years ago the mob, the Sanhedrin, the forty
   conspirators had tried to take his life in Jerusalem. Festus had no
   more courage to do right than Felix, however plausible his language
   might sound. Festus also, while wanting Paul to think that he would in
   Jerusalem "be judged of these things before me," in reality probably
   intended to turn Paul over to the Sanhedrin in order to please the
   Jews, probably with Festus present also to see that Paul received
   justice [me presente]. Festus possibly was surprised to find that the
   charges were chiefly against Jewish law, though one was against Caesar.
   It was not a mere change of venue that Paul sensed, but the utter
   unwillingness of Festus to do his duty by him and his willingness to
   connive at Jewish vengeance on Paul. Paul had faced the mob and the
   Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, two years of trickery at the hands of Felix in
   Caesarea, and now he is confronted by the bland chicanery of Festus. It
   is too much, the last straw.

   25:10 I am standing before Caesar's judgment-seat [HestOs epi tou
   bematos Kaisaros eimi]. Periphrastic present perfect indicative [hestOs
   eimi], second perfect participle [hestOs] of [histemi] (intransitive).
   Paul means to say that he is a Roman citizen before a Roman tribunal.
   Festus was the representative of Caesar and had no right to hand him
   over to a Jewish tribunal. Festus recognized this by saying to Paul
   "wilt thou" [theleis]. Where I ought to be judged [hou me dei
   krinesthai]. Rather, "Where I must be judged," for [dei] expresses
   necessity (it is necessary). Paul exposes the conduct of Festus with
   merciless precision. As thou also very well knowest [hOs kai su kallion
   epiginOskeis]. "As thou also dost understand (hast additional
   knowledge, [epiginOskeis] better" (than thou art willing to admit).
   That this is Paul's meaning by the use of the comparative [kallion]
   (positive [kalOs] is made plain by the confession of Festus to Agrippa
   in verse 18. Paul says that Festus knows that he has done no wrong to
   the Jews at all [ouden edikeka] and yet he is trying to turn him over
   to the wrath of the Jews in Jerusalem.

   25:11 If I am a wrong-doer [ei men oun adikO]. Condition of the first
   class with [ei] and the present active indicative of [adikeO] [a]
   privative and [dike]: "If I am in the habit of doing injustice,"
   assuming it to be true for the sake of argument. And have committed
   anything worthy of death [kai axion thanatou pepracha]. Same condition
   with the difference in tense [pepracha], perfect active indicative) of
   a single case instead of a general habit. Assuming either or both Paul
   draws his conclusion. I refuse not to die [ou paraitoumai to
   apothanein]. Old verb to ask alongside, to beg from, to deprecate, to
   refuse, to decline. See on Lu 14:18f. Josephus (Life, 29) has [thanein
   ou paraitoumai]. Here the articular second aorist active infinitive is
   in the accusative case the object of [paraitoumai]: "I do not beg off
   dying from myself." But if none of these things is [ei de ouden estin].
   [De] here is contrasted with [men] just before. No word for "true" in
   the Greek. [Estin] ("is") in the Greek here means "exists." Same
   condition (first class, assumed as true). Whereof these accuse me [hOn
   houtoi kategorousin mou]. Genitive of relative [hon] by attraction from
   [ha] (accusative with [kategorousin] to case of the unexpressed
   antecedent [toutOn] ("of these things"). [Mou] is genitive of person
   after [kategorousin]. No man can give me up to them [oudeis me dunatai
   autois charisasthai]. "Can" legally. Paul is a Roman citizen and not
   even Festus can make a free gift [charisasthai] of Paul to the
   Sanhedrin. I appeal unto Caesar [Kaisara epikaloumai]. Technical phrase
   like Latin Caesarem appello. Originally the Roman law allowed an appeal
   from the magistrate to the people (provocatio ad populum), but the
   emperor represented the people and so the appeal to Caesar was the
   right of every Roman citizen. Paul had crossed the Rubicon on this
   point and so took his case out of the hands of dilatory provincial
   justice (really injustice). Roman citizens could make this appeal in
   capital offences. There would be expense connected with it, but better
   that with some hope than delay and certain death in Jerusalem. Festus
   was no better than Felix in his vacillation and desire to curry favour
   with the Jews at Paul's expense. No doubt Paul's long desire to see
   Rome (19:21; Ro 15:22-28) and the promise of Jesus that he would see
   Rome (Ac 23:11) played some part in Paul's decision. But he made it
   reluctantly for he says in Rome (Ac 28:19): "I was constrained to
   appeal." But acquittal at the hands of Festus with the hope of going to
   Rome as a free man had vanished.

   25:12 When he had conferred with the council [sunlalesas meta tou
   sumbouliou]. The word [sumboulion] in the N.T. usually means "counsel"
   as in Mt 12:14, but here alone as an assembly of counsellors or
   council. But the papyri (Milligan and Moulton's Vocabulary) furnish a
   number of instances of this sense of the word as "council." Here it
   apparently means the chief officers and personal retinue of the
   procurator, his assessors [assessores consiliarii]. These local
   advisers were a necessity. Some discretion was allowed the governor
   about granting the appeal. If the prisoner were a well-known robber or
   pirate, it could be refused. Thou hast appealed unto Caesar [Kaisara
   epikeklesai]. The same technical word, but the perfect tense of the
   indicative. Unto Caesar thou shalt go [epi Kaisara poreusei]. Perhaps
   the volitive future (Robertson, Grammar, p. 874). Bengel thinks that
   Festus sought to frighten Paul with these words. Knowling suggests that
   "they may have been uttered, if not with a sneer, yet with the
   implication thou little knowest what an appeal to Caesar means.'" But
   embarrassment will come to Festus. He has refused to acquit this
   prisoner. Hence he must formulate charges against him to go before
   Caesar.

   25:13 When certain days were passed [HemerOn diagenomenon]. Genitive
   absolute of [diaginomai], to come between, "days intervening." Agrippa
   the King [Agrippas ho basileus]. Agrippa II son of Agrippa I of Ac
   12:20-23. On the death of Herod King of Chalcis A.D. 48, Claudius A.D.
   50 gave this Herod Agrippa II the throne of Chalcis so that Luke is
   correct in calling him king, though he is not king of Judea. But he was
   also given by Claudius the government of the temple and the right of
   appointing the high priest. Later he was given also the tetrarchies of
   Philip and Lysanias. He was the last Jewish king in Palestine, though
   not king of Judea. He angered the Jews by building his palace so as to
   overlook the temple and by frequent changes in the high priesthood. He
   made his capital at Caesarea Philippi which he called Neronias in
   honour of Nero. Titus visited it after the fall of Jerusalem. Bernice
   [Bernike]. He was her brother and yet she lived with him in shameful
   intimacy in spite of her marriage to her uncle Herod King of Chalcis
   and to Polemon King of Cilicia whom she left. Schuerer calls her both a
   Jewish bigot and a wanton. She afterwards became the mistress of Titus.
   Arrived at Caesarea [katentesan eis Kaisarian]. Came down (first aorist
   active of [katantaO] to Caesarea from Jerusalem. And saluted Festus
   [aspasamenoi ton Pheston]. The Textus Receptus has [aspasomenoi] the
   future participle, but the correct text is the aorist middle participle
   [aspasamenoi] which cannot possibly mean subsequent action as given in
   the Canterbury Revision "and saluted." It can only mean contemporaneous
   (simultaneous) action "saluting" or antecedent action like the margin
   "having saluted." But antecedent action is not possible here, so that
   simultaneous action is the only alternative. It is to be noted that the
   salutation synchronized with the arrival in Caesarea (note [kata],
   down, the effective aorist tense), not with the departure from
   Jerusalem, nor with the whole journey. Rightly understood the aorist
   participle here gives no trouble at all (Robertson, Grammar, pp.
   861-3).

   25:14 Tarried [dietribon]. Imperfect active of [diatribO], common verb
   for spending time (Ac 12:19, etc.). Many days [pleious hemeras]. More
   days (than a few). Accusative case for extent of time. Laid Paul's case
   [anetheto ta kata ton Paulon]. Second aorist middle indicative of
   [anatithemi], old verb to set before, to place up, as if for
   consultation in conference. Only twice in N.T. here and Ga 2:2. The
   motive of Festus is not given, though it was natural enough in view of
   the quandary of Festus about Paul (the things about Paul) and Agrippa's
   interest in and responsibility for Jewish worship in the temple in
   Jerusalem. It is quite possible that Festus had a bit of [ennui] over
   the visit of these Jewish dignitaries as "more days" went by. Hence the
   tone of Festus about Paul in this proposal for the entertainment of
   Agrippa and Bernice is certainly one of superficial and supremely
   supercilious indifference. Left a prisoner [katalelimmenos desmios].
   Perfect passive participle of [kataleipO], to leave behind. Paul is one
   of Felix's left overs (left behind), a sort of "junk" left on his
   hands. This cowardly Roman procurator thus pictures the greatest of
   living men and the greatest preacher of all time to this profligate
   pair (brother and sister) of sinners. Undoubtedly today in certain
   circles Christ and his preachers are held up to like contempt.

   25:15 Informed [enephanisan]. Same word as in 23:15, 22; 25:2 which
   see. Asking for sentence against him [aitoumenoi kat' autou katadiken].
   Only N.T. example of this old word (penalty, fine, condemnation) from
   [kata] and [dike] (justice against).

   25:16 It is not the custom of the Romans [hoti ouk estin ethos
   ROmaiois]. If a direct quotation, [hoti] is recitative as in Authorized
   Version. Canterbury Revision takes it as indirect discourse after
   [apekrithen] (I answered), itself in a relative clause [pros hous] with
   the present tense [estin], is) preserved as is usual. There is a touch
   of disdain (Furneaux) in the tone of Festus. He may refer to a demand
   of the Jews before they asked that Paul be brought to Jerusalem (25:3).
   At any rate there is a tone of scorn towards the Jews. Before that the
   accused have [prin e ho kategoroumenos echoi]. This use of the optative
   in this temporal clause with [prin e] instead of the subjunctive [an
   echei] is in conformity with literary Greek and occurs only in Luke's
   writings in the N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, p. 970). This sequence of
   modes is a mark of the literary style occasionally seen in Luke. It is
   interesting here to note the succession of dependent clauses in verses
   14-16. The accusers face to face [kata prosOpon tous kategorous]. Same
   word [kategoros] as in 23:30, 35; 25:18. This all sounds fair enough.
   And have had opportunity to make his defence concerning the matter laid
   against him [topon te apologias laboi peri tou egklematos]. Literally,
   "And should receive [laboi] optative for same reason as [echoi] above,
   second aorist active of [lambanO] opportunity for defence (objective
   genitive) concerning the charge" [egklematos] in N.T. only here and
   23:19 which see).

   25:17 When they were come together here [sunelthontOn enthade].
   Genitive absolute of second aorist active participle of [sunerchomai],
   but without [autOn] (they), merely understood. Delay [anabolen]. Old
   word from [anaballO], only here in N.T.

   25:18 Brought [epheron]. Imperfect active of [pherO], referring to
   their repeated charges. Of such evil things as I supposed [hOn egO
   hupenooun ponerOn]. Incorporation of the antecedent [ponerOn] into the
   relative clause and change of the case of the relative from the
   accusative [ha] object of [hupenooun] to the genitive like [ponerOn]
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 719). Note the imperfect active [hupenooun] of
   [huponoeO] to emphasize Festus's state of mind about Paul before the
   trial. This old verb only three times in the N.T. (here, Ac 13:25 which
   see; 27:27).

   25:19 But had [de eichon]. Descriptive imperfect active of [echO] and
   [de] of contrast (but). Concerning their own religion [peri tes idias
   deisidaimonias]. See on 17:22 for discussion of this word. Festus would
   hardly mean "superstition," whatever he really thought, because Agrippa
   was a Jew. And of one Jesus [kai peri tinos Iesou]. This is the climax
   of supercilious scorn toward both Paul and "one Jesus." Who was dead
   [tethnekotos]. Perfect active participle of [thneskO] agreeing with
   [Iesou] (genitive). As being dead. Whom Paul affirmed to be alive [hon
   ephasken ho Paulos zein]. Imperfect active of [phaskO], old form of
   [phemi] to say, in the N.T. only here and Ac 24:9; Ro 1:22. Infinitive
   [zein] in indirect discourse with [hon] (whom) the accusative of
   general reference. With all his top-loftical airs Festus has here
   correctly stated the central point of Paul's preaching about Jesus as
   no longer dead, but living.

   25:20 Being perplexed [aporoumenos]. Present middle participle of the
   common verb [aporeO] [a] privative and [poros] way), to be in doubt
   which way to turn, already in Mr 6:20 which see and Lu 24:4. The Textus
   Receptus has [eis] after here, but critical text has only the
   accusative which this verb allows (Mr 6:20) as in Thucydides and Plato.
   How to inquire concerning these things [ten peri toutOn zetesin].
   Literally, "as to the inquiry concerning these things." This is not the
   reason given by Luke in verse 9 (wanting to curry favour with the
   Jews), but doubtless this motive also actuated Festus as both could be
   true. Whether he would go to Jerusalem [ei bouloito poreuesthai eis
   Ierosoluma]. Optative in indirect question after [elegon] (asked or
   said) imperfect active, though the present indicative could have been
   retained with change of person: "Dost thou wish, etc.," [ei boulei],
   etc.). See Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1031, 1044. This is the question put
   to Paul in verse 9 though [theleis] is there used.

   25:21 When Paul had appealed [tou Paulou epikalesamenou]. Genitive
   absolute with first aorist middle participle of [epikaleomai], the
   technical word for appeal (verses 11, 12). The first aorist passive
   infinitive [terethenai] (to be kept) is the object of the participle.
   For the decision of the emperor [eis ten tou Sebastou diagnOsin].
   [DiagnOsin] (cf. [diagnOsomai] 24:22, I will determine) is the regular
   word for a legal examination [cognitio], thorough sifting [dia], here
   only in N.T. Instead of "the Emperor" it should be "the Augustus," as
   [Sebastos] is simply the Greek translation of Augustus, the adjective
   (Revered, Reverent) assumed by Octavius B.C. 27 as the [agnomen] that
   summed up all his various offices instead of Rex so offensive to the
   Romans having led to the death of Julius Caesar. The successors of
   Octavius assumed Augustus as a title. The Greek term [Sebastos] has the
   notion of worship (cf. [sebasma] in Acts 17:25). In the N.T. only here,
   verse 25; 27:1 (of the legion). It was more imposing than "Caesar"
   which was originally a family name (always official in the N.T.) and it
   fell in with the tendency toward emperor-worship which later played
   such a large part in Roman life and which Christians opposed so
   bitterly. China is having a revival of this idea in the insistence on
   bowing three times to the picture of Sun-Yat-Sen. Till I should send
   him to Caesar [heOs an anapempsO auton pros Kaisara]. Here [anapempsO]
   can be either future indicative or first aorist subjunctive (identical
   in first person singular), aorist subjunctive the usual construction
   with [heOs] for future time (Robertson, Grammar, p. 876). Literally,
   "send up" [ana] to a superior (the emperor). Common in this sense in
   the papyri and Koine writers. Here "Caesar" is used as the title of
   Nero instead of "Augustus" as [Kurios] (Lord) occurs in verse 26.

   25:22 I also could wish [eboulomen kai autos]. The imperfect for
   courtesy, rather than the blunt [boulomai], I wish, I want. Literally,
   "I myself also was wishing" (while you were talking), a compliment to
   the interesting story told by Festus. The use of [an] with the
   imperfect would really mean that he does not wish (a conclusion of the
   second class condition, determined as unfulfilled). [An] with the
   optative would show only a languid desire. The imperfect is keen enough
   and yet polite enough to leave the decision with Festus if inconvenient
   for any reason (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 885-7). Agrippa may have heard
   much about Christianity.

   25:23 When Agrippa was come and Bernice [elthontos tou Agrippa kai tes
   Bernikes]. Genitive absolute, the participle agreeing in number and
   gender (masculine singular, [elthontos] with [Agrippa], [Bernikes]
   being added as an afterthought. With great pomp [meta polles
   phantasias]. [Phantasia] is a Koine word (Polybius, Diodorus, etc.)
   from the old verb [phantazO] (Heb 12:21) and it from [phainO], common
   verb to show, to make an appearance. This is the only N.T. example of
   [phantasia], though the kindred common word [phantasma] (appearance)
   occurs twice in the sense of apparition or spectre (Mt 14:26; Mr 6:49).
   Herodotus (VII. 10) used the verb [phantazO] for a showy parade. Festus
   decided to gratify the wish of Agrippa by making the "hearing" of Paul
   the prisoner (verse 22) an occasion for paying a compliment to Agrippa
   (Rackham) by a public gathering of the notables in Caesarea. Festus
   just assumed that Paul would fall in with this plan for a grand
   entertainment though he did not have to do it. Into the place of
   hearing [eis to akroaterion]. From [akroaomai] (to be a hearer) and,
   like the Latin auditorium, in Roman law means the place set aside for
   hearing, and deciding cases. Here only in the N.T. Late word, several
   times in Plutarch and other Koine writers. The hearing was
   "semi-official" (Page) as is seen in verse 26. With the chief captains
   [sun te chiliarchois]. [Chiliarchs], each a leader of a thousand. There
   were five cohorts of soldiers stationed in Caesarea. And the principal
   men of the city [kai andrasin tois kat' exochen]. The use of [kat'
   exochen], like our French phrase par excellence, occurs here only in
   the N.T., and not in the ancient Greek, but it is found in inscriptions
   of the first century A.D. (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary). [Exoche]
   in medical writers is any protuberance or swelling. Cf. our phrase
   "outstanding men." At the command of Festus [keleusantos tou Phestou].
   Genitive absolute again, "Festus having commanded."

   25:24 Which are here present with us [hoi sunparontes hemin]. Present
   articular participle of [sunpareimi] (only here in N.T.) with
   associative instrumental case [hemin]. Made suit to me [enetuchon moi].
   Second aorist active indicative of [entugchanO], old verb to fall in
   with a person, to go to meet for consultation or supplication as here.
   Common in old Greek and Koine. Cf. Ro 8:27, 34. See [enteuxis]
   (petition) 1Ti 2:1. Papyri give many examples of the technical sense of
   [enteuxis] as petition (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 121). Some MSS.
   have plural here [enetuchon] rather than the singular [enetuchen].
   Crying [boOntes]. Yelling and demanding with loud voices. That he ought
   not to live any longer [me dein auton zein meketi]. Indirect command
   (demand) with the infinitive [dein] for [dei] (it is necessary). The
   double negative [me--meketi] with [zein] intensifies the demand.

   25:25 But I found [egO de katelabomen]. Second aorist middle of
   [katalambanO], to lay hold of, to grasp, to comprehend as in 4:13;
   10:34. That he had committed nothing worthy of death [meden axion auton
   thanatou peprachenai]. Perfect active infinitive of [prassO] in
   indirect assertion with negative [me] and accusative [auton] of general
   reference, the usual idiom. verse 25 repeats the statement in verse 21,
   perhaps for the benefit of the assembled dignitaries.

   25:26 No certain thing [asphales ti--ou]. Nothing definite or reliable
   [a] privative, [sphallO], to trip). All the charges of the Sanhedrin
   slipped away or were tripped up by Paul. Festus confesses that he had
   nothing left and thereby convicts himself of gross insincerity in his
   proposal to Paul in verse 9 about going up to Jerusalem. By his own
   statement he should have set Paul free. The various details here bear
   the marks of the eyewitness. Luke was surely present and witnessed this
   grand spectacle with Paul as chief performer. Unto my lord [tOi
   kuriOi]. Augustus (Octavius) and Tiberius refused the title of [kurios]
   (lord) as too much like rex (king) and like master and slave, but the
   servility of the subjects gave it to the other emperors who accepted it
   (Nero among them). Antoninus Pius put it on his coins. Deissmann (Light
   from the Ancient East, p. 105) gives an ostracon dated Aug. 4, A.D. 63
   with the words "in the year nine of Nero the lord" [enatou NerOnos tou
   kuriou]. Deissmann (op. cit., pp. 349ff.) runs a most interesting
   parallel "between the cult of Christ and the cult of Caesar in the
   application of the term [kurios], lord" in ostraca, papyri,
   inscriptions. Beyond a doubt Paul has all this fully in mind when he
   says in 1Co 12:3 that "no one is able to say [Kurios Iesous] except in
   the Holy Spirit" (cf. also Php 2:11). The Christians claimed this word
   for Christ and it became the test in the Roman persecutions as when
   Polycarp steadily refused to say " Lord Caesar" and insisted on saying
   "Lord Jesus" when it meant his certain death. Before you [eph' humOn].
   The whole company. In no sense a new trial, but an examination in the
   presence of these prominent men to secure data and to furnish
   entertainment and pleasure to Agrippa (verse 22). Especially before
   thee [malista epi sou]. Out of courtesy. It was the main reason as
   verse 22 shows. Agrippa was a Jew and Festus was glad of the chance to
   see what he thought of Paul's case. After examination had [tes
   anakriseOs genomenes]. Genitive absolute, "the examination having taken
   place." [Anakrisis] from [anakrinO] (cf. 12:19; 24:8; 28:18) is a legal
   term for preliminary examination. Only here in the N.T. Inscriptions
   and papyri give it as examination of slaves or other property. That I
   may have somewhat to write [hopOs schO ti grapsO]. Ingressive aorist
   subjunctive [schO] (may get) with [hopOs] (final particle like [hina].
   [Ti grapsO] in indirect question after [schO] is either future
   indicative or aorist subjunctive (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1045). Festus
   makes it plain that this is not a "trial," but an examination for his
   convenience to help him out of a predicament.

   25:27 Unreasonable [alogon]. Old word from [a] privative and [logos]
   (reason, speech). "Without reason" as of animals (Jude 1:10; 2Pe 2:12),
   "contrary to reason" here. These the only N.T. instances and in harmony
   with ancient usage. In sending [pemponta]. Note accusative case with
   the infinitive [semanai] though [moi] (dative) just before. Cf. same
   variation in 15:22f.; 22:17. Signify [semanai]. First aorist active
   infinitive (not [semenai], the old form) of [semainO], to give a sign
   [semeion]. The charges [tas aitias]. This naive confession of Festus
   reveals how unjust has been his whole treatment of Paul. He had to send
   along with the appeal of Paul litterae dimissoriae [apostoli] which
   would give a statement of the case (Page).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 26

   26:1 Thou art permitted [epitrepetai soi]. Literally, It is permitted
   thee. As if Agrippa were master of ceremonies instead of Festus.
   Agrippa as a king and guest presides at the grand display while Festus
   has simply introduced Paul. For thyself [huper seautou]. Some MSS. have
   [peri] (concerning). Paul is allowed to speak in his own behalf. No
   charges are made against him. In fact, Festus has admitted that he has
   no real proof of any charges. Stretched forth his hand [ekteinas ten
   cheira]. Dramatic oratorical gesture (not for silence as in 12:17;
   13:16) with the chain still upon it (verse 29) linking him to the
   guard. First aorist active participle of [ekteinO], to stretch out.
   Made his defence [apelogeito]. Inchoative imperfect of [apologeomai]
   (middle), "began to make his defence." This is the fullest of all
   Paul's defences. He has no word of censure of his enemies or of
   resentment, but seizes the opportunity to preach Christ to such a
   distinguished company which he does with "singular dignity" (Furneaux).
   He is now bearing the name of Christ "before kings" (Ac 9:15). In
   general Paul follows the line of argument of the speech on the stairs
   (chapter Ac 22).

   26:2 I think myself happy [hegemai emauton makarion]. See on Mt 5:3 for
   [makarios]. Blass notes that Paul, like Tertullus, begins with captatio
   benevolentiae, but absque adulatione. He says only what he can
   truthfully speak. For [hegemai] see Php 3:7; 1Ti 6:1 (perfect middle
   indicative of [hegeomai], I have considered. That I am to make my
   defence [mellOn apologeisthai]. Literally, "being about to make my
   defence." Whereof I am accused [hOn egkaloumai]. Genitive with
   [egkaloumai] as in 19:40 or by attraction from accusative of relative
   [ha] to case of antecedent [pantOn].

   26:3 Especially because thou art expert [malista gnOsten onta se]. Or
   like the margin, "because thou art especially expert," according as
   [malista] is construed. [GnOsten] is from [ginOskO] and means a knower,
   expert, connoisseur. Plutarch uses it and Deissmann (Light, etc., p.
   367) restores it in a papyrus. Agrippa had the care of the temple, the
   appointment of the high priest, and the care of the sacred vestments.
   But the accusative [onta se] gives trouble here coming so soon after
   [sou] (genitive with [epi]. Some MSS. insert [epistamenos] or [eidOs]
   (knowing) but neither is genuine. Page takes it as "governed by the
   sense of thinking or considering." Knowling considers it an
   anacoluthon. Buttmann held it to be an accusative absolute after the
   old Greek idiom. [Tuchon] is such an instance though used as an adverb
   (1Co 16:6). It is possible that one exists in Eph 1:18. See other
   examples discussed in Robertson's Grammar, pp. 490f. Customs and
   questions [ethOn te kai zetematOn]. Both consuetudinum in practicis and
   quaestionum in theoreticis (Bengel). Agrippa was qualified to give Paul
   an understanding and a sympathetic hearing. Paul understands perfectly
   the grand-stand play of the whole performance, but he refused to be
   silent and chose to use this opportunity, slim as it seemed, to get a
   fresh hearing for his own case and to present the claims of Christ to
   this influential man. His address is a masterpiece of noble apologetic.
   Patiently [makrothumOs]. Adverb from [makrothumos]. Only here in the
   N.T., though [makrothumia] occurs several times. Vulgate has
   longanimiter. Long spirit, endurance, opposite of impatience. So Paul
   takes his time.

   26:4 My manner of life [ten men oun biOsin mou]. With [men oun] Paul
   passes from the captatio benevolentiae (verses 1, 2) "to the narratio
   or statement of his case" (Page). [BiOsis] is from [bioO] (1Pe 4:2) and
   that from [bios] (course of life). This is the only instance of
   [biOsis] yet found except the Prologue (10) of Ecclesiasticus and an
   inscription given in Ramsay's Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, Vol II,
   p. 650. Know [isasi]. Literary form instead of the vernacular Koine
   [oidasin]. Paul's early life in Tarsus and Jerusalem was an open book
   to all Jews.

   26:5 Having knowledge of me from the first [proginOskontes me anOthen].
   Literally, "knowing me beforehand" (both [pro] and [anOthen], from the
   beginning of Paul's public education in Jerusalem (Knowling). Cf. 2Pe
   3:17. If they be willing to testify [ean thelOsin marturein]. Condition
   of third class [ean] and subjunctive). A neat turning of the tables on
   the distinguished audience about Paul's Jerusalem reputation before his
   conversion. After the straitest sect [ten akribestaten hairesin]. This
   is a true superlative (not elative) and one of the three (also
   [hagiOtatos], Jude 1:20, [timiOtatos] Re 18:12; 21:11) superlatives in
   [-tatos] in the N.T. (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 279f., 670), though
   common enough in the LXX and the papyri. [Hairesin] (choosing) is
   properly used here with Pharisees (Josephus, Life, 38). Religion
   [threskeias]. From [threskeuO] and this from [threskos] (Jas 1:26), old
   word for religious worship or discipline, common in the papyri and
   inscriptions (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary) for reverent worship,
   not mere external ritual. In N.T. only here, Jas 1:26f.; Col 2:18. I
   lived a Pharisee [ezesa Pharisaios]. Emphatic position. Paul knew the
   rules of the Pharisees and played the game to the full (Ga 1:14; Php
   3:5f.). The Talmud makes it plain what the life of a Pharisee was. Paul
   had become one of the leaders and stars of hope for his sect.

   26:6 And now [kai nun]. Sharp comparison between his youth and the
   present. To be judged for the hope [ep' elpidi--krinomenos]. The hope
   of the resurrection and of the promised Messiah (13:32). Page calls
   verses 6-8 a parenthesis in the course of Paul's argument by which he
   shows that his life in Christ is a real development of the best in
   Pharisaism. He does resume his narrative in verse 9, but verses 6-8 are
   the core of his defence already presented in Ga 3; Ro 9-11 where he
   proves that the children of faith are the real seed of Abraham.

   26:7 Our twelve tribes [to dOdekaphulon hemOn]. A word found only here
   in N.T. and in Christian and Jewish writings, though [dOdekamenon]
   (twelve month) is common in the papyri and [dekaphulos] (ten tribes) in
   Herodotus. Paul's use of this word for the Jewish people, like Jas 1:1
   [tais dOdeka phulais], the twelve tribes), shows that Paul had no
   knowledge of any "lost ten tribes." There is a certain national pride
   and sense of unity in spite of the dispersion (Page). Earnestly [en
   ekteneiai]. A late word from [ekteinO], to stretch out, only here in
   N.T., but in papyri and inscriptions. Page refers to Simeon and Anna
   (Lu 2:25-28) as instances of Jews looking for the coming of the
   Messiah. Note the accusative of [nukta kai hemeran] as in 20:31. Hope
   to attain [elpizei katantesai]. This Messianic hope had been the red
   thread running through Jewish history. Today, alas, it is a sadly worn
   thread for Jews who refuse to see the Messiah in Jesus. I am accused by
   Jews [egkaloumai hupo IoudaiOn]. The very word used in 23:28
   [enekaloun] which see, and by Jews of all people in the world whose
   mainspring was this very "hope." It is a tremendously effective turn.

   26:8 Incredible with you [apiston par' humin]. This old word [apiston]
   [a] privative and [pistos] means either unfaithful (Lu 12:46),
   unbelieving (Joh 20:27), or unbelievable as here). Paul turns suddenly
   from Agrippa to the audience [par' humin], plural), most of whom were
   probably Gentiles and scouted the doctrine of the resurrection as at
   Athens (17:32). If God doth raise the dead [ei ho theos nekrous
   egeirei]. Condition of the first class assuming that God does raise
   dead people. Only God can do it. This rhetorical question needs no
   answer, though the narrative resumed in verse 9 does it in a way.

   26:9 I verily thought with myself [egO men oun edoxa emautOi]. Personal
   construction instead of the impersonal, a touch of the literary style.
   Paul's "egoism" is deceived as so often happens. I ought [dein].
   Infinitive the usual construction with [dokeO]. Necessity and a sense
   of duty drove Paul on even in this great sin (see on 23:1), a common
   failing with persecutors. Contrary [enantia]. Old word (adjective),
   over against, opposite (Ac 27:4), then hostile to as here.

   26:10 I both shut up many [pollous te katekleisa]. Effective aorist
   active of [katakleiO], old word to shut down like a trap door, in N.T.
   only here and Lu 3:20. Double use of [te] (both--and). Having received
   authority from the chief priests [ten para tOn archiereOn exousian
   labOn]. "The authority," he says. Paul was the official persecutor of
   the saints under the direction of the Sanhedrin. He mentions "chief
   priests" (Sadducees), though a Pharisee himself. Both parties were
   co-operating against the saints. And when they were put to death
   [anairoumenOn te autOn]. Genitive absolute with present passive
   participle of [anaireO]. I gave my vote against them [katenegka
   psephon]. "I cast down my pebble" (a black one). The ancient Greeks
   used white pebbles for acquittal (Re 2:17), black ones for condemnation
   as here (the only two uses of the word in the N.T.). Paul's phrase (not
   found elsewhere) is more vivid than the usual [katapsephizO] for
   voting. They literally cast the pebbles into the urn. Cf. [sumpsephizO]
   in Ac 19:19, [sugkatapsephizo] in Ac 1:26. If Paul's language is taken
   literally here, he was a member of the Sanhedrin and so married when he
   led the persecution. That is quite possible, though he was not married
   when he wrote 1Co 7:7f., but a widower. It is possible to take the
   language figuratively for approval, but not so natural.

   26:11 Punishing [timOrOn]. Old word [timOreO] originally to render
   help, to succor [timOros], from [time] and [ouros], then to avenge (for
   honour). In N.T. only here and 22:5. I strove to make them blaspheme
   [enagkazon blasphemein]. Conative imperfect active of [anagkazO], old
   verb from [anagke] (necessity, compulsion). The tense, like the
   imperfect in Mt 3:14; Lu 1:59, leaves room to hope that Paul was not
   successful in this effort, for he had already said that he brought many
   "unto death" (22:4). I persecuted [ediOkon]. Imperfect active again,
   repeated attempts. The old verb [diOkO] was used to run after or chase
   game and then to chase enemies. The word "persecute" is the Latin
   persequor, to follow through or after. It is a vivid picture that Paul
   here paints of his success in hunting big game, a grand heresy hunt.
   Even unto foreign cities [kai eis exO poleis]. We know of Damascus, and
   Paul evidently planned to go to other cities outside of Palestine and
   may even have done so before the fateful journey to Damascus.

   26:12 Whereupon [en hois]. "In which things" (affairs of persecution),
   "on which errand." Cf. 24:18. Paul made them leave Palestine (11:19)
   and followed them beyond it (9:2). With the authority and commission
   [met' exousias kai epitropes]. Not merely "authority" [exousia], but
   express appointment [epitrope], old word, but here only in N.T.,
   derived from [epitropos], steward, and that from [epitrepO], to turn
   over to, to commit).

   26:13 At midday [hemeras meses]. Genitive of time and idiomatic use of
   [mesos], in the middle of the day, more vivid than [mesembrian] (22:6).
   Above the brightness of the sun [huper ten lamproteta tou heliou]. Here
   alone not in Ac 9; 22, though implied in 9:3; 22:6, "indicating the
   supernatural character of the light" (Knowling). Luke makes no effort
   to harmonize the exact phrases here with those in the other accounts
   and Paul here (verse 16) blends together what Jesus said to him
   directly and the message of Jesus through Ananias (9:15). The word
   [lamprotes], old word, is here alone in the N.T. Shining round about me
   [perilampsan me]. First aorist active participle of [perilampO], common
   Koine verb, in N.T. only here and Lu 2:9.

   26:14 When we were all fallen [pantOn katapesontOn hemOn]. Genitive
   absolute with second aorist active participle of [katapiptO]. In the
   Hebrew language [tei Ebraidi dialektOi]. Natural addition here, for
   Paul is speaking in Greek, not Aramaic as in 22:2. It is hard for thee
   to kick against the goad [skleron soi pros kentra laktizein]. Genuine
   here, but not in chapters 9, 22. A common proverb as Aeschylus Ag.
   1624: [Pros kentra me laktize]. "It is taken from an ox that being
   pricked with a goad kicks and receives a severer wound" (Page). Cf. the
   parables of Jesus (Mt 13:35). Blass observes that Paul's mention of
   this Greek and Latin proverb is an indication of his culture. Besides
   he mentions (not invents) it here rather than in chapter 22 because of
   the culture of this audience. [Kentron] means either sting as of bees
   (II Macc. 14:19) and so of death (1Co 15:55) or an iron goad in the
   ploughman's hand as here (the only two N.T. examples). Note plural here
   (goads) and [laktizein] is present active infinitive so that the idea
   is "to keep on kicking against goads." This old verb means to kick with
   the heel (adverb [lax], with the heel), but only here in the N.T. There
   is a papyrus example of kicking [laktizO] with the feet against the
   door.

   26:16 Arise and stand [anastethi kai stethi]. "Emphatic assonance"
   (Page). Second aorist active imperative of compound verb [anistemi] and
   simplex [histemi]. "Stand up and take a stand." Have I appeared unto
   thee [Ophthen soi]. First aorist passive indicative of [horaO]. See on
   Lu 22:43. To appoint thee [procheirisasthai se]. See 3:30; 22:14 for
   this verb. Both of the things wherein thou hast seen me [hOn te eides
   me]. The reading [me] (not in all MSS.) makes it the object of [eides]
   (didst see) and [hOn] is genitive of [ha] (accusative of general
   reference) attracted to the case of the unexpressed antecedent
   [toutOn]. Paul is thus a personal eyewitness of the Risen Christ (Lu
   1:1; 1Co 4:1; 9:1). And of the things wherein I will appear unto thee
   [hOn te ophthesomai soi]. Here again [hOn] is genitive of the
   accusative (general reference) relative [ha] attracted to the case of
   the antecedent [toutOn] or [ekeinOn] as before. But [ophthesomai] is
   first future passive of [horaO] and cannot be treated as active or
   middle. Page takes it to mean "the visions in which I shall be seen by
   you," the passive form bringing out the agency of God. See those in Ac
   18:9; 23:11; 2Co 12:2. The passive voice, however, like [apekrithen]
   and [ephobethen], did become sometimes transitive in the Koine
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 819).

   26:17 Delivering thee [exairoumenos se]. Present middle participle of
   [exaireO], old verb and usually so rendered, but the old Greek also
   uses it for "choose" as also in LXX (Isa 48:10). The papyri give
   examples of both meanings and either makes good sense here. God was
   continually rescuing Paul "out of the hands of Jews and Gentiles and
   Paul was a chosen vessel" (9:15). Modern scholars are also divided.

   26:18 To open [anoixai]. First aorist active infinitive of purpose.
   That they may turn [tou epistrepsai]. Another infinitive of purpose
   first aorist active (genitive case and articular), epexegetic to
   [anoixai]. That they may receive [tou labein]. Another genitive
   articular infinitive of purpose subordinate (epexegetic) to [tou
   epistrepsai]. Sanctified by faith in me [hegiasmenois pistei tei eis
   eme]. Perfect passive participle of [hagiazO], instrumental case of
   [pistei], article before [eis eme] ("by faith, that in me"). These
   important words of Jesus to Paul give his justification to this
   cultured audience for his response to the command of Jesus. This was
   the turning point in Paul's career and it was a step forward and
   upward.

   26:19 Wherefore [hothen]. This relatival adverb (cf. 14:26; 28:13)
   gathers up all that Paul has said. I was not disobedient [ouk egenomen
   apeithes]. Litotes again, "I did not become (second aorist middle
   indicative of [ginomai] disobedient" [apeithes], old word already in Lu
   1:17). Unto the heavenly vision [tei ouraniOi optasiai]. A later form
   of [opsis], from [optazO], in LXX, and in N.T. (Lu 1:22; 24:23; Ac
   26:19; 2Co 12:1). Only time that Paul uses it about seeing Christ on
   the Damascus road, but no reflection on the reality of the event.

   26:20 But declared [alla apeggellon]. Imperfect active of [apaggellO],
   repeatedly. Throughout all the country of Judea [pasan te ten chOran
   tes Ioudaias]. The accusative here in the midst of the datives [tois en
   DamaskOi, Ierosolumois, tois ethnesin] seems strange and Page feels
   certain that [eis] should be here even though absent in Aleph A B. But
   the accusative of extent of space will explain it (Robertson, Grammar,
   p. 469). Doing works worthy of repentance [axia tes metanoias erga
   prassontas]. Accusative case of present active participle [prassontas]
   because of the implied [autous] with the present infinitive [metanoein]
   (repent) and [epistrephein] (turn), though the dative [prassousin]
   could have been used to agree with [ethnesin] (Gentiles). Cf. Mt 3:8
   for similar language used of the Baptist. Paul, the greatest of
   theologians, was an interesting practical preacher.

   26:21 Assayed to kill me [epeirOnto diacheirisasthai]. Conative
   imperfect middle of [peiraO], the old form of the later Koine [peirazO]
   so common in the Koine, but in N.T. here only. Some MSS. have it in Ac
   9:26; Heb 4:15. The old verb [diacheirizO], to take in hand, middle to
   lay hands on, to slay, occurs in N.T. only here and 5:30 which see.

   26:22 Having therefore obtained [oun tuchOn]. Second aorist active
   participle of old verb [tugchanO]. The help that is from God
   [epikourias tes apo tou theou]. Old word from [epikoureO], to aid, and
   that from [epikouros], ally, assister. Only here in N.T. God is Paul's
   ally. All of the plots of the Jews against Paul had failed so far. I
   stand [hesteka]. Second perfect of [histemi], to place, intransitive to
   stand. Picturesque word (Page) of Paul's stability and fidelity (cf.
   Php 4:1; Eph 6:13). Both to small and great [mikrOi te kai megalOi].
   Dative singular (rather than instrumental, taking [marturoumenos]
   middle, not passive) and use of [te kai] links the two adjectives
   together in an inclusive way. These two adjectives in the singular
   (representative singular rather than plural) can apply to age (young
   and old) or to rank (Re 11:18) as is specially suitable here with
   Festus and Agrippa present. In Ac 8:10 (Heb 8:11) the phrase explains
   [pantes] (all). Saying nothing but what [ouden ektos legOn hOn].
   "Saying nothing outside of those things which." The ablative relative
   [hOn] is attracted into the case of the unexpressed antecedent [toutOn]
   and so ablative after [ektos] (adverbial preposition common in LXX, the
   papyri. In N.T. here and 1Co 6:18; 15:27; 2Co 12:2f.). Cf. Lu 16:29
   about Moses and the prophets.

   26:23 How that the Christ must suffer [ei pathetos ho Christos].
   Literally, "if the Messiah is subject to suffering." [Ei] can here mean
   "whether" as in Heb 7:15. This use of a verbal in [-tos] for capability
   or possibility occurs in the N.T. alone in [pathetos] (Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 157). This word occurs in Plutarch in this sense. It is
   like the Latin patibilis and is from paschO. Here alone in N.T. Paul is
   speaking from the Jewish point of view. Most rabbis had not rightly
   understood Isa 53. When the Baptist called Jesus "the Lamb of God" (Joh
   1:29) it was a startling idea. It is not then "must suffer" here, but
   "can suffer." The Cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the rabbis.
   How that he first by the resurrection of the dead [ei prOtos ex
   anastaseOs nekrOn]. Same construction with [ei] (whether). This point
   Paul had often discussed with the Jews: "whether he (the Messiah) by a
   resurrection of dead people." Others had been raised from the dead, but
   Christ is the first [prOtos] who arose from the dead and no longer dies
   (Ro 6:19) and proclaims light [phOs mellei kataggellein]. Paul is still
   speaking from the Jewish standpoint: "is about to (going to) proclaim
   light." See verse 18 for "light" and Lu 2:32. Both to the people and to
   the Gentiles [tOi te laOi kai tois ethnesin]. See verse 17. It was at
   the word Gentiles [ethne] that the mob lost control of themselves in
   the speech from the stairs (22:21f.). So it is here, only not because
   of that word, but because of the word "resurrection" [anastasis].

   26:24 As he thus made his defence [tauta autou apologoumenou]. Genitive
   absolute again with present middle participle. Paul was still speaking
   when Festus interrupted him in great excitement. With a loud voice
   [megalei tei phOnei]. Associative instrumental case showing manner
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 530) and the predicate use of the adjective,
   "with the voice loud" (elevated). Thou art mad [mainei]. Old verb for
   raving. See also Joh 10:20; Ac 12:15; 1Co 14:23. The enthusiasm of Paul
   was too much for Festus and then he had spoken of visions and
   resurrection from the dead (verse 8). "Thou art going mad" (linear
   present), Festus means. Thy much learning doth turn thee to madness [ta
   polla se grammata eis manian peritrepei]. "Is turning thee round." Old
   verb [peritrepO], but only here in N.T. Festus thought that Paul's
   "much learning" (= "many letters," cf. Joh 7:15 of Jesus) of the Hebrew
   Scriptures to which he had referred was turning his head to madness
   (wheels in his head) and he was going mad right before them all. The
   old word [mania] (our mania, frenzy, cf. maniac) occurs here only in
   N.T. Note unusual position of [se] between [polla] and [grammata]
   (Robertson, Grammar, pp. 418, 420)

   26:25 But speak forth [alla apophtheggomai]. Verb for dignified and
   elevated discourse, a word from the literary Koine, not the vernacular.
   In N.T. only here and 2:4, 14 which see. It occurs three times in
   Vettius Valens in a "mantic" sense. Paul was not ruffled by the rude
   and excited interruption of Festus, but speaks with perfect courtesy in
   his reply "words of truth and soberness." The old word [sOphrosune]
   (soundness of mind) from [sOphrOn] (and that from [sOs] and [phren] is
   directly opposed to "madness" [mania] and in N.T. occurs only here and
   1Ti 2:15.

   26:26 For the king knoweth of these things [epistatai gar peri toutOn
   ho basileus]. [Epistatai] (present middle probably Ionic form of
   [ephistemi] is a literary word and suits well here (cf. 24:10). Freely
   [parresiazomenos]. Present middle participle, speaking fully, making a
   clean breast of it. From [parresia] [pan, rhesis] (cf. 13:46). Is
   hidden from him [lanthanein auton]. Escapes his notice. Infinitive in
   indirect discourse after [peithomai] (I am persuaded).

   26:27 I know that thou believest [oida hoti pisteueis]. Paul had
   "cornered" Agrippa by this direct challenge. As the Jew in charge of
   the temple he was bound to confess his faith in the prophets. But Paul
   had interpreted the prophets about the Messiah in a way that fell in
   with his claim that Jesus was the Messiah risen from the dead. To say,
   "Yes" would place himself in Paul's hands. To say "No" would mean that
   he did not believe the prophets. Agrippa had listened with the keenest
   interest, but he slipped out of the coils with adroitness and a touch
   of humour.

   26:28 With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian
   [en oligOi me peitheis Christianon poiesai]. The Authorized rendering
   is impossible: "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." [En
   oligOi] does not mean "almost." That would require [oligou, par'
   oligon], or [dei oligou]. It is not clear, however, precisely what [en
   oligoi] does mean. It may refer to time (in little time) or a short
   cut, but that does not suit well [en megalOi] in verse 29. Tyndale and
   Crammer rendered it "somewhat" (in small measure or degree). There are,
   alas, many "somewhat" Christians. Most likely the idea is "in (or with)
   small effort you are trying to persuade [peitheis], conative present
   active indicative) me in order to make me a Christian." This takes the
   infinitive [poiesai] to be purpose (Page renders it by "so as") and
   thus avoids trying to make [poiesai] like [genesthai] (become). The
   aorist is punctiliar action for single act, not "perfect." The tone of
   Agrippa is ironical, but not unpleasant. He pushes it aside with a
   shrug of the shoulders. The use of "Christian" is natural here as in
   the other two instances (11:26; 1Pe 4:16).

   26:29 I would to God [euxaimen an tOi theOi]. Conclusion of
   fourth-class condition (optative with [an], undetermined with less
   likelihood, the so-called potential optative (Robertson, Grammar, p.
   1021). Polite and courteous wish (first aorist middle optative of
   [euchomai]. Whether with little or with much [kai en mikrOi kai en
   megalOi]. Literally, "both in little and in great," or "both with
   little and with great pains" or "both in some measure and in great
   measure." Paul takes kindly the sarcasm of Agrippa. Such as I am
   [toioutous hopoios kai egO eimi]. Accusative [toioutous] with the
   infinitive [genesthai]. Paul uses these two qualitative pronouns
   instead of repeating the word "Christian." Except these bonds [parektos
   tOn desmOn toutOn]. Ablative case with [parektos] (late preposition for
   the old [parek]. Paul lifts his right manacled hand with exquisite
   grace and good feeling.

   26:30 Rose up [aneste]. Second aorist active of [anistemi]
   (intransitive), agreeing only with "the king" [ho basileus]. The
   entertainment was over.

   26:31 They spake one to another [elaloun pros allelous]. Imperfect
   active, describing the eager conversation of the dignitaries about
   Paul's wonderful speech. Nothing worthy of death or bonds [ouden
   thanatou e desmOn axion]. This is the unanimous conclusion of all these
   dignitaries (Romans, Jews, Greeks) as it was of Festus before (25:25).
   But Paul had not won any of them to Christ. The conclusion leaves
   Festus in a predicament. Why had he not set Paul free before this?

   26:32 This man might have been set at liberty [Apolelusthai edunato ho
   anthrOpos houtos]. Conclusion of the second class condition (determined
   as unfulfilled) without [an] as in 24:19 because of [edunato] (verb of
   possibility, Robertson, Grammar, p. 1014). Note perfect passive
   infinitive [apolelusthai] from [apoluO]. He certainly "could have been
   set free." Why was it not done? If he had not appealed unto Caesar [ei
   me epekekleto Kaisara]. Condition of the second class with the past
   perfect middle indicative (op. cit., p. 1015) of [epikaleO] (cf.
   25:11f.). But Paul only appealed to Caesar after Festus had tried to
   shift him back to Jerusalem and had refused to set him free in
   Caesarea. Festus comes out with no honour in the case. Since Agrippa
   was a favourite at court perhaps Festus would be willing to write
   favourably to Caesar.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 27

   27:1 That we should sail [tou apoplein hemas]. This genitive articular
   infinitive with [ekrithe] like the LXX construction translating the
   Hebrew infinitive construct is awkward in Greek. Several similar
   examples in Lu 17:1; Ac 10:25; 20:3 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1068). Luke
   alone uses this old verb in N.T. He uses nine compounds of [pleO], to
   sail. Note the reappearance of "we" in the narrative. It is possible,
   of course, that Luke was not with Paul during the series of trials at
   Caesarea, or at least, not all the time. But it is natural for Luke to
   use "we" again because he and Aristarchus are travelling with Paul. In
   Caesarea Paul was the centre of the action all the time whether Luke
   was present or not. The great detail and minute accuracy of Luke's
   account of this voyage and shipwreck throw more light upon ancient
   seafaring than everything else put together. Smith's Voyage and
   Shipwreck of St. Paul is still a classic on the subject. Though so
   accurate in his use of sea terms, yet Luke writes like a landsman, not
   like a sailor. Besides, the character of Paul is here revealed in a
   remarkable fashion. They delivered [paredidoun]. Imperfect active
   [Omega] form rather than the old [-mi] form [paredidosan] as in 4:33,
   from [paradidOmi]. Perhaps the imperfect notes the continuance of the
   handing over. Certain other prisoners [tinas heterous desmOtas]. Bound
   [desmOtas] like Paul, but not necessarily appellants to Caesar, perhaps
   some of them condemned criminals to amuse the Roman populace in the
   gladiatorial shows, most likely pagans though [heterous] does not have
   to mean different kind of prisoners from Paul. Of the Augustan band
   [speires Sebastes]. Note Ionic genitive [speires], not [speiras]. See
   on Mt 27:1; Ac 10:1. [Cohortis Augustae]. We do not really know why
   this cohort is called "Augustan." It may be that it is part of the
   imperial commissariat (frumentarii) since Julius assumes chief
   authority in the grain ship (verse 11). These legionary centurions when
   in Rome were called peregrini (foreigners) because their work was
   chiefly in the provinces. This man Julius may have been one of them.

   27:2 In a ship of Adramyttium [ploiOi HadramuntenOi]. A boat belonging
   to Adramyttium, a city in Mysia in the province of Asia. Probably a
   small coasting vessel on its way home for the winter stopping at
   various places [topous]. Julius would take his chances to catch another
   ship for Rome. The usual way to go to Rome was to go to Alexandria and
   so to Rome, but no large ship for Alexandria was at hand. We put to sea
   [anechthemen]. First aorist passive of [anagO], usual word in Luke.
   Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us [ontos sun
   hemin Aristarchou Makedonos ThessalonikeOs]. Genitive absolute. Ramsay
   suggests that Luke and Aristarchus accompanied Paul as his slaves since
   they would not be allowed to go as his friends. But Luke was Paul's
   physician and may have gained permission on that score.

   27:3 The next day [tei heterai]. Locative case with [hemerai]
   understood. We touched [katechthemen]. First aorist passive of
   [katagO], the usual term for "coming down" from the seas as [anagO]
   above (and verse 4) is for "going up" to sea. So it looks to sailors.
   Sidon was 67 miles from Caesarea, the rival of Tyre, with a splendid
   harbour. The ship stopped here for trade. Treated Paul kindly
   [philanthrOpOs tOi PaulOi chresamenos]. "Using [chresamenos], first
   aorist middle participle of [chraomai], to use) Paul (instrumental case
   used with this verb) kindly" [philanthrOpOs], "philanthropically,"
   adverb from [phil-anthrOpos], love of mankind). He was kindly to Paul
   throughout the voyage (verse 43; 28:16), taking a personal interest in
   his welfare. Refresh himself [epimeleias tuchein]. Second aorist active
   infinitive of [tugchanO] (to obtain) with the genitive [epimeleias],
   old word from [epimeles], careful, only here in the N.T. Whether it was
   mere hospitality we do not know. It may have been medical attention
   required because of Paul's long confinement. This is Paul's first visit
   to Sidon, but Christians were already in Phoenicia (11:19) and so Paul
   had "friends" here.

   27:4 We sailed under the lee of Cyprus [hupepleusamen ten Kupron].
   First aorist active indicative of [hupopleO], to sail under. Cyprus was
   thus on the left between the ship and the wind from the northwest,
   under the protection of Cyprus. Because the winds were contrary [dia to
   tous anemous einai enantious]. The articular infinitive after [dia] and
   the accusative of general reference [anemous] with predicate accusative
   [enantious], facing them, in their very teeth if they went that way).
   The Etesian winds were blowing from the northwest so that they could
   not cut straight across from Sidon to Patara with Cyprus on the right.
   They must run behind Cyprus and hug the shore of Cilicia and Pamphylia.

   27:5 When we had sailed across [diapleusantes]. First aorist active
   participle of [diapleO] (another compound of [pleO]. The sea which is
   off Cilicia and Pamphylia [to pelagos to kata ten Kilikian kai
   Pamphulian]. [Pelagos] is properly the high sea as here. In Mt 18:6
   (which see) Jesus uses it of "the depth of the sea." Only these
   examples in the N.T. The current runs westward along the coast of
   Cilicia and Pamphylia and the land would protect from the wind. We came
   to Myra of Lycia [katelthamen eis Murra tes Lukias]. Literally, "We
   came down." This town was two and a half miles from the coast of Lycia.
   The port Andriace had a fine harbour and did a large grain business. No
   disciples are mentioned here nor at Lasea, Melita, Syracuse, Rhegium.

   27:6 Sailing for Italy [pleon eis ten Italian]. This was the
   opportunity for which Lysias had been looking. So he put [enebibasen],
   first aorist active of [embibazO], to cause to enter. Cf. [epibantes]
   in verse 2) prisoners and soldiers on board. This was a ship of
   Alexandria bound for Rome, a grain ship (38) out of its course because
   of the wind. Such grain ships usually carried passengers.

   27:7 When we had sailed slowly [braduploountes]. Present active
   participle of [braduploeO] [bradus], slow, [plous], voyage). Literally,
   "sailing slowly," not "having or had sailed slowly." Only here and in
   Artemidorus (sec. cent. A.D.). It may mean "tacking" before the wind.
   Polybius uses [tachuploeO], to sail swiftly. Many days [en hikanais
   hemerais]. See on Lu 7:6 for [hikanos]. Literally, "in considerable
   days." With difficulty [molis]. Used in old Greek, like [mogis] (Lu
   9:39) from [molos], toil (see Ac 14:18). Over against Cnidus [kata ten
   Knidon]. "Down along Cnidus." A hundred and thirty miles from Myra, the
   southwest point of Asia Minor and the western coast. Here the
   protection of the land from the northwest wind ceased. The wind not
   further suffering us [me proseOntos hemas tou anemou]. Genitive
   absolute with present active participle of [proseaO], one of the few
   words still "not found elsewhere" (Thayer). Regular negative [me] with
   participles. They could not go on west as they had been doing since
   leaving Myra. We sailed under the lee of Crete [hupepleusamen ten
   Kreten]. See under verse 4. Instead of going to the right of Crete as
   the straight course would have been they sailed southwest with Crete to
   their right and got some protection against the wind there. Over
   against Salmone [kata SalmOnen]. Off Cape Salmone, a promontory on the
   east of the island.

   27:8 Coasting along [paralegomenoi]. Present middle participle of
   [paralegO], to lay beside, not from [legO], to collect or [legO], to
   say. Diodorus Siculus uses [paralegomai] in precisely this sense of
   coasting along, like Latin legere oram. In N.T. only here and verse 13.
   Fair Havens [Kalous Limenas]. This harbour is named Kalus Limeonas, a
   small bay two miles east of Cape Matala. It opens to the East and
   Southeast, but is not fit to winter in. This harbour would protect them
   for a time from the winds. The city of Lasea [polis Lasea]. Neither
   Lasea nor Fair Havens is mentioned by any ancient writer, two of the
   hundred cities of Crete.

   27:9 Where much time was spent [Hikanou chronou diagenomenou]. Genitive
   absolute again with second aorist middle participle of [diaginomai], to
   come in between [dia]. "Considerable time intervening," since they
   became weatherbound in this harbour, though some take it since they
   left Caesarea. And the voyage was now dangerous [kai ontos ede
   episphalous]. Genitive absolute, "and the voyage being already [ede] =
   Latin jam) dangerous" (old word from [epi] and [sphallO], to trip, to
   fall, and so prone to fall, here only in N.T.). Because the Fast was
   now already gone by [dia to kai ten nesteian ede pareleluthenai].
   Accusative (after [dia] of the articular infinitive perfect active of
   [parerchomai], to pass by, with the accusative of general reference
   [nesteian], the great day of atonement of the Jews, Le 16:29ff.)
   occurring about the end of September. The ancients considered
   navigation on the Mediterranean unsafe from early October till the
   middle of March. In A.D. 59 the Fast occurred on Oct. 5. There is
   nothing strange in Luke using this Jewish note of time as in 20:6
   though a Gentile Christian. Paul did it also (1Co 16:8). It is no proof
   that Luke was a Jewish proselyte. We do not know precisely when the
   party left Caesarea (possibly in August), but in ample time to arrive
   in Rome before October if conditions had been more favourable. But the
   contrary winds had made the voyage very slow and difficult all the way
   (verse 7) besides the long delay here in this harbour of Fair Havens.
   Paul admonished them [pareinei ho Paulos]. Imperfect active of
   [paraineO], old word to exhort from [para] and [aineO], to praise
   (3:8), only here and verse 22 in N.T. It is remarkable that a prisoner
   like Paul should venture to give advice at all and to keep on doing it
   (imperfect tense inchoative, began to admonish and kept on at it). Paul
   had clearly won the respect of the centurion and officers and also felt
   it to be his duty to give this unasked for warning. I perceive
   [theOrO]. Old word from [theOros], a spectator. See Lu 10:18. Paul does
   not here claim prophecy, but he had plenty of experience with three
   shipwrecks already (2Co 11:25) to justify his apprehension. Will be
   [mellein esesthai]. Infinitive in indirect assertion followed by future
   infinitive after [mellein] in spite of [hoti] which would naturally
   call for present indicative [mellei], an anacoluthon due to the long
   sentence (Robertson, Grammar, p. 478). With injury [meta hubreOs]. An
   old word from [huper] (above, upper, like our "uppishness") and so
   pride, insult, personal injury, the legal word for personal assault
   (Page). Josephus (Ant. III. 6, 4) uses it of the injury of the
   elements. Loss [zemian]. Old word, opposite of [kerdos], gain or profit
   (Php 3:7f.). Nowhere else in N.T. Lading [phortiou]. Diminutive of
   [phortos] (from [pherO], to bear) only in form. Common word, but in
   N.T. only here in literal sense, as metaphor in Mt 11:30; 23:4; Lu
   11:46; Ga 6:5. But also of our lives [alla kai tOn psuchOn]. Common use
   of [psuche] for life, originally "breath of life" (Ac 20:10), and also
   "soul" (14:2). Fortunately no lives were lost, though all else was. But
   this outcome was due to the special mercy of God for the sake of Paul
   (verse 24), not to the wisdom of the officers in rejecting Paul's
   advice. Paul begins now to occupy the leading role in this marvellous
   voyage.

   27:11 Gave more heed [mallon epeitheto]. Imperfect middle of [peithO],
   to yield to (with the dative case). The "Frumentarian" centurion ranked
   above the captain and owner. As a military officer the centurion was
   responsible for the soldiers, the prisoners, and the cargo of wheat. It
   was a government ship. Though the season was not advanced, the
   centurion probably feared to risk criticism in Rome for timidity when
   the wheat was so much needed in Rome (Knowling). To the master [tOi
   kubernetei]. Old word from [kubernaO], to steer, and so steersman,
   pilot, sailing-master. Common in this sense in the papyri. In N.T. only
   here and Re 18:17. And to the owner of the ship [kai tOi nauklerOi].
   Old word compounded of [naus] and [kleros] and used for owner of the
   ship who acted as his own skipper or captain. The papyri examples
   (Moulton and Milligan's Vocabulary) all have the meaning "captain"
   rather than "owner."

   27:12 Because the haven was not commodious to winter in [aneuthetou tou
   limenos huparchontos pros paracheimasian]. Genitive absolute again
   present tense of [huparchO]: "The harbour being unfit [aneuthetou],
   this compound not yet found elsewhere, simplex in Lu 9:62; 14:35; Heb
   6:7) for wintering" [paracheimasia], only here in N.T., but in Polybius
   and Diodorus, in an inscription A.D. 48, from [paracheimazO]. The more
   part advised [hoi pleiones ethento boulen]. Second aorist middle
   indicative of [tithemi], ancient idiom with [boulen], to take counsel,
   give counsel. Lysias held a council of the officers of the ship on the
   issue raised by Paul. If by any means they could reach Phoenix and
   winter there [ei pOs dunainto katantesantes eis Phoinika
   paracheimasai]. The optative [dunainto] (present middle of [dunamai]
   here with [ei] is a condition of the fourth class with the notion of
   purpose implied and indirect discourse (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1021).
   "We vote for going on the chance that we may be able" (Page). Phoenix
   is the town of palms (Joh 12:13), the modern Lutro, the only town in
   Crete on the southern coast with a harbour fit for wintering, though
   Wordsworth and Page argue for Phineka which suits Luke's description
   better. The verb [paracheimazO], to winter, is from [para] and
   [cheimOn] (see also 28:11). Used in several Koine writers. Looking
   northeast and southeast [bleponta kata liba kai kata chOron]. There are
   two ways of interpreting this language. [Lips] means the southwest wind
   and [chOros] the northwest wind. But what is the effect of [kata] with
   these words? Does it mean "facing" the wind? If so, we must read
   "looking southwest and northwest." But [kata] can mean down the line of
   the wind (the way the wind is blowing). If so, then it is proper to
   translate "looking northeast and southeast." This translation suits
   Lutro, the other suits Phoenike. Ramsay takes it to be Lutro, and
   suggests that sailors describe the harbour by the way it looks as they
   go into it (the subjectivity of the sailors) and that Luke so speaks
   and means Lutro which faces northeast and southeast. On the whole Lutro
   has the best of the argument.

   27:13 When the south wind blew softly [hupopneusantos notou]. Genitive
   absolute with aorist active participle of [hupopneO], old verb to blow
   under, then to blow gently, here only in N.T. "A south wind having
   blown gently," in marked contrast to the violent northwest wind that
   they had faced so long. They were so sure of the wisdom of their
   decision that they did not even draw up the small boat attached by a
   rope to the vessel's stern ( verse 16). It was only some forty miles to
   Lutro. Their purpose [tes protheseOs], set before them, from
   [protithemi], genitive after [krateO] [kekratekenai], perfect active
   infinitive in indirect discourse). They weighed anchor [arantes]. First
   aorist active participle of [airO], old verb used in technical sense
   with [tas agkuras] (anchors) understood as in Thucydides I. 52; II. 23,
   "having lifted the anchors." Page takes it simply as "moving." Sailed
   along Crete [parelegonto ten Kreten]. Imperfect middle. See verse 8,
   "were coasting along Crete." Close in shore [asson]. Comparative adverb
   of [agki], near, and so "nearer" to shore. Only here in N.T.

   27:14 After no long time [met' ou polu]. Litotes again. Beat down from
   it [ebalen kat' autes]. Second aorist active indicative of [ballO], to
   throw. Here "dashed" (intransitive). [Autes] is in the ablative, not
   genitive case, beat "down from it" (Crete), not "against it or on it."
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 606). [Autes] cannot refer to [ploion] (boat)
   which is neuter. So the ablative case with [kata] as in Mr 5:13, Homer
   also. The Cretan mountains are over 7,000 feet high. A tempestuous wind
   which is called Euraquilo [anemos tuphOnikos ho kaloumenos EurakulOn].
   [TuphOn=TuphOs] was used for the typhoon, a violent whirlwind [turbo]
   or squall. This word gives the character of the wind. The [EurakulOn]
   (reading of Aleph A B against the Textus Receptus [EurokludOn] has not
   been found elsewhere. Blass calls it a hybrid word compounded of the
   Greek [euros] (east wind) and the Latin [aquilo] (northeast). It is
   made like [euronotos] (southeast). The Vulgate has euroaquilo. It is
   thus the east north east wind. Page considers Euroclydon to be a
   corruption of Euraquilo. Here the name gives the direction of the wind.

   27:15 When the ship was caught [sunarpasthentos tou ploiou]. Genitive
   absolute again with first aorist passive of [sunarpazO], old word, in
   N.T. only Lu 8:29; Ac 6:12; 19:29, and here. Graphic picture as if the
   ship was seized by a great monster. Face the wind [antophthalmein tOi
   anemOi]. Dative case with the vivid infinitive of [antophthalmeO] from
   [antophthalmos], looking in the eye, or eye to eye [anti], facing and
   [opthalmos], eye). Eyes were painted on the prows of vessels. The ship
   could not face the wind enough to get to Phoenix. Modern sailors talk
   of sailing into the eye of the wind. We were not able to look the wind
   in the eye. Koine verb used by Polybius. Some MSS. have it in Ac 6:11,
   but only here in N.T. In Wisdom of Sol. 12:14 it is used of a prince
   who cannot look God in the face. Clement of Rome 34 uses it of an idle
   workman not able to look his employer in the face (Milligan and
   Moulton's Vocabulary). We gave way [epidontes]. Second aorist active
   participle of [epididOmi], giving way to the wind. Were driven
   [epherometha]. Imperfect passive of [pherO], "we were being borne
   along." We "scudded before the gale" (Page). "The suddenness of the
   hurricane gave no time to furl the great mainsail" (Furneaux).

   27:16 Running under the lee of [hupodramontes]. Second aorist active
   participle of [hupotrechO]. Same use of [hupo] as in [hupepleusamen]
   (verses 4, 8) for "under the lee", under the protection of. [Nesion] is
   diminutive of [nesos], a small island. The MSS. vary between Cauda (B)
   and Clauda (Aleph). To secure the boat [perikrateis genesthai tes
   skaphes]. "To become masters [perikrateis] from [peri] and [kratos],
   power over, found in Susannah and ecclesiastical writers, and here only
   in N.T.) of the boat ("dug out," like Indian boats, literally, from
   [skaptO], to dig, old word, here only in N.T. and verses 30, 32). The
   smooth water behind the little island enabled them to do this. When
   they had hoisted it up [hen arantes]. "Which (the little boat) having
   hoisted up [arantes], verse 13)." Even so it was "with difficulty"
   [molis]. Perhaps the little boat was waterlogged. Used helps
   [boetheiais echrOnto]. Imperfect middle of [chraomai] with instrumental
   case. The "helps" were ropes or chains, no doubt. Under-girding the
   ship [hupozOnnuntes to ploion]. Present active participle of
   [hupozOnnumi]. Old verb, here only in N.T. Probably cables [hupozOmata]
   or ropes were used under the hull of the ship laterally or even
   longitudinally, tightly secured on deck. This "frapping" was more
   necessary for ancient vessels because of the heavy mast. The little
   island made it possible to do this also. Lest we be cast upon the
   Syrtis [me eis ten Surtin ekpesOsin]. Final clause after verb of
   fearing [phoboumenoi] with [me] and the second aorist active
   subjunctive of [ekpiptO], old verb to fall out or off, to be cast away.
   So here and verses 26, 29, a classical use of the verb for a ship
   driven out of its course on to shoals or rocks (Page who cites
   Xenophon, Anab. VII. 5, 12). The Syrtis was the name for two quicksands
   between Carthage and Cyrenaica, this clearly being the Syrtis Major
   most dangerous because of the sandbanks [surtis], from [surO]. The wind
   would drive the ship right into this peril if something were not done.
   They lowered the gear [chalasantes to skeuos]. First aorist active
   participle of [chalaO] (cf. Lu 5:4 for lowering the nets). [Skeuos]
   means vessel or gear. They slackened or reduced sail, especially the
   mainsail, but leaving enough to keep the ship's head as close to the
   wind as was practicable. So were driven [houtOs epheronto]. Imperfect
   passive indicative again as in verse 15 with the addition of [houtOs]
   (thus). The ship was now fixed as near to the wind (E N E) as possible
   (seven points). That would enable the ship to go actually W by N and so
   avoid the quicksands. J. Smith has shown that, a day being lost around
   Cauda, the ship going 36 miles in 24 hours in 13 days would make 468
   miles. The Island of Malta (Melita) is precisely in that direction (W
   by N) from Cauda and is 480 miles. Page sees a difficulty about this
   explanation of the steady drift of the ship in the word [diapheromenon]
   in verse 27, but that was at the end of the drifting and the varied
   winds could have come then and not before. The whole narrative as
   explained carefully in Smith's Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul is a
   masterpiece of precise and accurate scholarship. A resume of his
   results appears in my Luke the Historian in the Light of Research.

   27:18 As we laboured exceedingly with the storm [sphodrOs cheimazomenOn
   hemOn]. Genitive absolute with present passive participle of
   [cheimazO], old verb to afflict with a tempest [cheima], stormy
   weather), to toss upon the waves, here alone in N.T. They began to
   throw overboard [ekbalen epoiounto]. Literally, "They began to make
   (inchoative imperfect middle of [poieO] a casting out" [ekbolen] from
   [ekballO], to cast out, old word, only here in N.T.). Cf. Latin
   jacturam facere. This to lighten the ship by throwing overboard the
   cargo. The grain in the ship would shift and make it list and so added
   to the danger. They cast out [eripsan]. Third person plural aorist
   active of [riptO], not [eripsamen] as Textus Receptus. With their own
   hands [autocheires]. Old word [autos, cheir] but here alone in N.T.
   Vivid and graphic touch by Luke who, of course, watched every movement
   day by day. The tackling [ten skeuen]. The furniture of the ship that
   could be spared. It was becoming desperate.

   27:20 When neither sun nor stars shone upon us [mete heliou mete astrOn
   epiphainontOn]. Genitive absolute again. For many days [epi pleionas
   hemeras]. For more days than a few. No small tempest [cheimonos ouk
   oligou]. Litotes again. All hope that we should be saved was now taken
   away [loipon perieireito elpis pasa tou sOzesthai hemas]. "For the rest
   (or future) there began to be taken from around us [perieireito]
   inchoative imperfect and see use of the verb in 2Co 13:16 of the veil)
   all hope of the being saved so far as we were concerned." Despair was
   beginning to settle like a fog on all their hopes. Had Paul lost hope?

   27:21 When they had been long without food [polles te asitias
   huparchouses]. Genitive absolute, the old word [asitia] from [asitos]
   (verse 33) [a] privative and [sitos], food, here alone in N.T.
   Literally, "There being much abstinence from food." They had plenty of
   grain on board, but no appetite to eat (sea-sickness) and no fires to
   cook it (Page). "Little heart being left for food" (Randall). Galen and
   other medical writers use [asitia] and [asitos] for want of appetite.
   Stood forth [statheis]. As in 1:15; 2:14; 17:22. Pictorial word (Page)
   that sets forth the vividness and solemnity of the scene (Knowling). Ye
   should have hearkened unto me [edei men peitharchesantas moi].
   Literally, "It was necessary for you hearkening unto me not to set sail
   [me anagesthai]." It was not the "I told you so" of a small nature,
   "but a reference to the wisdom of his former counsel in order to induce
   acceptance of his present advice" (Furneaux). The first aorist active
   participle is in the accusative of general reference with the present
   infinitive [anagesthai]. And have gotten this injury and loss [kerdesai
   te ten hubrin tauten kai ten zemian]. This Ionic form [kerdesai] (from
   [kerdaO] rather than [kerdenai] or [kerdanai] is common in late Greek
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 349). The Revised Version thus carries over the
   negative [me] to this first aorist active infinitive [kerdesai] from
   [kerdaO] (cf. on Mt 16:26). But Page follows Thayer in urging that this
   is not exact, that Paul means that by taking his advice they ought to
   have escaped this injury and loss. "A person is said in Greek to gain a
   loss' when, being in danger of incurring it, he by his conduct saves
   himself from doing so." This is probably Paul's idea here.

   27:22 And now [kai ta nun]. Accusative plural neuter article of general
   reference in contrast with [men] in verse 21. Paul shows modesty
   (Bengel) in the mild contrast. No loss of life [apobole psuches
   oudemia]. Old word from [apoballO], to throw away, only twice in N.T.
   Ro 11:15 (rejection) and here. He had foretold such loss of life as
   likely (verse 10), but he now gives his reason for his changed view.

   27:23 For there stood by me [pareste gar moi]. Second aorist active
   (intransitive) indicative of [paristemi] with the locative case (beside
   me). The very form used by Paul of his trial (2Ti 4:17) when "the Lord
   stood by me" [ho de kurios moi pareste] when others deserted him. This
   angel of the God whom Paul serves (in distinction from the heathen
   gods) is the reason for Paul's present confidence.

   27:24 Thou must stand before Caesar [Kaisari se dei parastenai]. Note
   the same [dei] (must) as in 23:11 when Jesus appeared to Paul in
   Jerusalem and the same verb [parastenai] (second aorist active
   infinitive) used in verse 23. Hath granted thee [kecharistai soi].
   Perfect middle indicative of [charizomai] and that from [charis], a
   gift or grace. The lives of those that sailed with Paul God had spared
   as a gift [charis] to Paul.

   27:25 Wherefore be of good cheer [dio euthumeite]. God had spoken. That
   was enough. This old verb from [euthumos] in the N.T. only here, verse
   25; Jas 5:13. See the adjective 27:36. For I believe God [pisteuO gar
   tOi theOi]. This is Paul's reason for his own good cheer and for his
   exhortation to confidence in spite of circumstances so untoward. Paul
   had doubtless prayed for his own life and for the lives of all. He was
   sure that he was to bear his witness in Rome.

   27:26 We must be cast [dei hemas ekpesein]. It is necessary for us to
   fall out [ekpesein], second aorist active infinitive of [ekpiptO]. It
   was not revealed to Paul what island it would be.

   27:27 As we were driven to and fro [diapheromenOn hemOn]. Genitive
   absolute with present passive participle of [diapherO], old verb to
   bear different ways [dia=duo], two), this way and that. Continued to be
   tossed to and fro in the rough seas. It would seem so to those on
   board. It does not necessarily mean that the wind had changed. The
   fourteenth night is reckoned from the time they left Fair Havens. In
   the sea of Adria [en tOi Hadriai]. Not the Adriatic Sea as we now call
   the sea between Italy and the mainland of Illyricum, but all the lower
   Mediterranean between Italy and Greece. Luke's usage is like that of
   Strabo. Surmised [hupenooun]. Imperfect active indicative of
   [huponoeO], inchoative, began to suspect. That they were drawing near
   to some country [prosagein tina autois chOran]. Infinitive with
   accusative of general reference in indirect assertion. [ProsagO] is
   here used intransitively and Luke writes from the sailor's standpoint
   that a certain land was drawing near to them [autois], dative). The
   sailors heard the sound of breakers and grew uneasy.

   27:28 They sounded [bolisantes]. First aorist active participle of
   [bolizO] rare verb only here and in Eustathius who says it was familiar
   in ancient Greek. Apparently from [bolis], a missile or dart, and so to
   throw down the lead into the sea, to heave the lead, to take soundings.
   The inscriptions give [bolimos] for "leaden." Twenty fathoms [orguias
   eikosi]. This old word, from [oregO], to stretch, means the distance
   from one outstretched middle finger tip to the other likewise
   out-stretched. After a little space [brachu diastesantes]. Literally,
   "standing apart a little" (second aorist active participle of
   [diistemi], that is, the ship going a short distance further on. A ship
   today approaching St. Paul's Bay by the rocky point of Koura would pass
   first twenty, then fifteen fathoms (Furneaux).

   27:29 Lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground [me pou kata
   tracheis topous ekpesOmen]. The usual construction after a verb of
   fearing [me] and the aorist subjunctive [ekpesOmen]. Literally, "Lest
   somewhere [pou] we should fall out down against [kata] rocky places."
   The change in the soundings made it a very real fear. [Tracheis]
   (rough) is old adjective, but in the N.T. only here and Lu 3:5 (from
   Isa 40:4). Four anchors [agkuras tessaras]. Old word from [agke]. In
   N.T. only in this chapter, with [rhiptO] here, with [ekteinO] in verse
   30, with [periaireO] in verse 40; and Heb 6:19 (figuratively of hope).
   From the stern [ek prumnes]. Old word, but in N.T. only in Mr 4:38;
   here and 41 in contrast with [prOira] (prow). The usual practice was
   and is to anchor by the bows. "With a view to running the ship ashore
   anchoring from the stern would, it is said, be best" (Page). Nelson is
   quoted as saying that he had been reading Ac 27 the morning of the
   Battle of Copenhagen (April, 1801) where he anchored his ships from the
   stern. Wished for the day [euchonto]. Imperfect middle, kept on praying
   for "day to come" [hemeran genesthai] before the anchors broke under
   the strain of the storm or began to drag. If the ship had been anchored
   from the prow, it would have swung round and snapped the anchors or the
   stern would have faced the beach.

   27:30 The sailors [tOn nautOn]. Old word from [naus] (ship), in N.T.
   only here, verse 30; Re 18:17. Were seeking [zetountOn]. Genitive
   absolute again with present active participle of [zeteO] to seek. Had
   lowered [chalasantOn]. Aorist active participle of [chalazO]. Under
   colour [prophasei]. Possibly the same word as "prophecy" (from
   [pro-phemi], to speak forth), but here pretence, pretext, although it
   may come from [prophainO], to show forth. The use here is an old one
   and appears also in Mr 12:40; Lu 20:47; 1Th 2:5; Php 1:18. As though
   [hOs]. The alleged reason, a common Greek idiom with [hOs] and the
   participle (Robertson, Grammar, p. 966). Here with [mellontOn]. From
   the foreship [ek prOires]. Old word for prow of the ship. In the N.T.
   only here and verse 41. Note here [ekteinein] (lay out, stretch out)
   rather than [rhipsantes] (casting) in verse 29, for they pretended to
   need the small boat to stretch out or lay out the anchors in front.

   27:31 Except these abide in the ship [Ean me houtoi meinOsin en tOi
   ploiOi]. Condition of the third class (undetermined, but with hope,
   etc.). Paul has no hesitancy in saying this in spite of his strong
   language in verse 24 about God's promise. He has no notion of lying
   supinely down and leaving God to do it all. Without the sailors the
   ship could not be properly beached.

   27:32 The ropes [ta schoinia]. Diminutive of [schoinos], old word, but
   in N.T. only here and Joh 2:15. Paul is now saviour of the ship and the
   soldiers quickly cut loose the skiff and "let her fall off" [eiasan
   auten ekpesein] rather than be the means of the escape of the sailors
   who were needed. This dastardly scheme of the sailors would have
   brought frightful loss of life.

   27:33 While the day was coming on [achri hou hemera emellen ginesthai].
   More likely here [achri hou] (for [achri toutou hOi] with the imperfect
   [emellen], has its usual meaning, "until which time day was about to
   come on [ginesthai], present middle infinitive, linear action)." That
   is Paul kept on exhorting or beseeching [parekalei], imperfect active)
   them until dawn began to come on (cf. verse 39 when day came). In Heb
   3:13 [achri hou] with the present indicative has to mean "so long as"
   or while, but that is not true here (Robertson, Grammar, p. 975). See
   on Ac 2:46 for the same phrase for partaking food [metalambanO
   trophes], genitive case) as also in 27:34. Paul wanted them to be ready
   for action when day really came. "Fourteenth day" repeated (verse 27),
   only here in the accusative of duration of time [hemeran]. It is not
   clear whether the "waiting" [prosdokOntes], present active participle
   predicate nominative complementary participle after [diateleite],
   Robertson, Grammar, p. 1121) means fourteen days of continuous fasting
   or only fourteen successive nights of eager watching without food.
   Galen and Dionysius of Halicarnassus employ the very idiom used here by
   Luke [asitos diateleO]. Having taken nothing [methen proslabomenoi].
   Second aorist middle participle of [proslambanO] with the accusative
   [methen] rather than the more usual [meden]. Probably Paul means that
   they had taken no regular meals, only bits of food now and then.

   27:34 For this is for your safety [touto gar pros tes humeteras
   sOterias huparchei]. Note [sOteria] in sense of "safety," literal
   meaning, not spiritual salvation. This is the only instance in the N.T.
   of the use of [pros] with the ablative meaning "from the side of" your
   safety, though a classic idiom (Robertson, Grammar, p. 623), an example
   of Luke's literary style. Perish [apoleitai]. Future middle
   (intransitive) of [apollumi (-uO)], to destroy. So the oldest MSS.
   rather than [peseitai] from [piptO], to fall. This proverbial
   expression occurs also in Lu 21:18 which see and in 1Sa 14:45; 2Sa
   14:11; 1Ki 1:52.

   27:35 Gave thanks to God [eucharistesen tOi theOi]. First aorist active
   indicative of [eucharisteO] from which our word "Eucharist" comes. It
   was saying grace like the head of a Hebrew family and the example of
   Paul would encourage the others to eat. Probably Paul, Luke, and
   Aristarchus had memories of the Lord's supper (Ac 2:42) while to others
   it was only an ordinary meal (Lu 24:30).

   27:36 Then were they all of good cheer [euthumoi de genomenoi]. More
   exactly, "Then all becoming cheerful," because of Paul's words and
   conduct. Took food [proselabonto trophes]. Partitive genitive here
   (some food), not accusative as verse 33. Paul's courage was contagious.

   27:37 Two hundred three-score and sixteen souls [diakosiai hebdomekonta
   hex]. The Vatican Manuscript (B) has [hOs] in place of [diakosiai] (two
   hundred) which Westcott and Hort put in the margin. But Alford is
   probably correct in suggesting that the scribe of B wrote [hOs] by
   repeating the omega in [ploiOi] with [s] = 200 (Greek numeral). If the
   number 276 seems large, it is to be remembered that we do not know the
   size of the ship. Josephus (Life, 3) says that there were 600 on the
   ship that took him to Italy. The grain ships were of considerable size.
   The number included sailors, soldiers, and prisoners. A muster or roll
   call may have been made.

   27:38 When they had eaten enough [koresthentes trophes]. First aorist
   passive of [korennumi], old verb to satisfy, to satiate, with the
   genitive. Literally, "Having been satisfied with food." Here only in
   the N.T. They lightened [ekouphizon]. Inchoative imperfect active,
   began to lighten. Old verb from [kouphos] and originally to be light,
   but transitive to lighten, as here, from Hippocrates on. Throwing out
   the wheat [ekballomenoi ton siton]. The cargo of wheat. The second
   [ekbole] (verse 18) or casting out and overboard which was only
   partially done at first.

   27:39 They knew not [ouk epeginOskon]. Imperfect active of
   [epiginOskO], to recognize. Probably conative, tried to recognize and
   could not (Conybeare and Howson). The island was well-known (28:1,
   [epegnOmen], but St. Paul's Bay where the wreck took place was some
   distance from the main harbour (Valetta) of Melita (Malta). They
   perceived [katenooun]. Imperfect active of [katanoeO], gradually
   perceived after some effort as in 11:16. This beach seemed their only
   hope. They took counsel [ebouleuonto]. Imperfect middle showing the
   process of deliberation and doubt. The bay "having a beach" [echonta
   aigialon] is a phrase found in Xenophon's Anabasis VI. 4, 4. Whether
   they could drive [ei dunainto eksOsai]. This use of the optative with
   [ei] in questions of this sort (implied indirect) is a neat Greek idiom
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1021). B C Bohairic read [eksOsai] (first
   aorist active infinitive of [eksOzO], to save out (so Westcott and
   Hort), instead of [exOsai] (from [exOtheO], to push out, as Textus
   Receptus).

   27:40 Casting off [perielontes]. Second aorist active of [periaireO].
   Literally, "Having taken away from around," that is all four anchors
   from around the stern. Cf. the other verbs with [agkuras] in verse 29,
   30. They left them in the sea [eiOn eis ten thalassan]. Imperfect
   active of [eaO], either descriptive or inchoative. They let the anchors
   go and the ropes fell down into the sea. At the same time loosing the
   bands of the rudders [hama anentes tas zeukterias tOn pedaliOn]. On the
   use of [hama] with the participle, old Greek idiom see Robertson,
   Grammar, p. 1139. The second aorist active participle of [aniemi], to
   relax, loosen up. Old verb, in N.T. Ac 16:26; 27:40; Eph 6:9; Heb 13:5.
   Thayer notes that [zeukterias] (bands) occurs nowhere else, but several
   papyri use it of yokes and waterwheels (Moulton and Milligan's
   Vocabulary). The word for rudders [pedalion] is an old one (from
   [pedon], the blade of an oar), but in the N.T. only here and Jas 3:4.
   Page notes that the ancient ships had a pair of paddle rudders like
   those of the early northmen, one on each quarter. The paddle rudders
   had been fastened while the ship was anchored. Hoisting up the foresail
   to the wind [eparantes ton artemOna tei pneousei]. Supply [aurai]
   (breeze) after [pneousei] (blowing). It is not clear what "sail" is
   meant by "[artemOna]." No other example in Greek is known, though the
   scholiast to Juvenal XII. 68 explains [velo prora suo] by artemone
   solo. Hence "foresail" is probably correct. They made for the beach
   [kateichon eis ton aigialon]. Imperfect active of [katechO], to hold
   down, perhaps inchoative. "They began to hold the ship steadily for the
   beach."

   27:41 But lighting upon [peripesontes de]. Second aorist active
   participle of [peripiptO], old verb to fall into and so be encompassed
   by as in Lu 10:30; Jas 1:2. There is a current on one side of St.
   Paul's Bay between a little island (Salmonetta) and Malta which makes a
   sand bank between the two currents. Unexpectedly the ship stuck in this
   sandbar. Where two seas met [dithalasson]. Used in Strabo and Dio
   Chrysostom for divided seas [dis, thalassa]. They ran the vessel
   aground [epekeilan ten naun]. First aorist active indicative of old
   verb [epikellO], to run a ship ashore. Only here in N.T. Here also we
   have the only N.T. use of [naus] for ship (from [naO, neO], to swim) so
   common in ancient Greek. Our word navy is from this word through the
   Latin. Struck [ereisasa]. First aorist active participle of [ereidO],
   old verb to fix firmly. Only here in N.T. Unmoveable [asaleutos]. From
   [a] privative and [saleuO] to shake. Old word. In N.T. only here and
   Heb 12:28. Began to break up [elueto]. Inchoative imperfect passive of
   the old verb [luO], to loosen. The prow was stuck in the sand-bar, and
   the stern was breaking to pieces by the opposing waves lashing on both
   sides. It was a critical moment.

   27:42 Counsel was to kill [boule egeneto hina--apokteinOsin]. The
   soldiers did not relish the idea of the escape of the prisoners. Hence
   there came this "counsel" [boule]. Regular Greek idiom for purpose
   [hina] and aorist active subjunctive of [apokteinO], to kill). Soldiers
   were responsible for the lives of prisoners (Ac 12:19). Swim out
   [ekkolumbesas]. First aorist active participle of [ekkolumbaO], old
   verb to swim out and so away. Escape [diaphugei]. Second aorist
   (effective) active subjunctive of [diapheugO], to make a clean [dia]
   escape.

   27:43 To save Paul [diasOsai ton Paulon]. Effective first aorist active
   infinitive of [diasOzO]. And no wonder for the centurion knew now how
   much they all owed to Paul. Stayed them from their purpose [ekOleusen
   autous tou boulematos].) Ablative case of [boulema] after [ekOleusen]
   (from [kOleuO], to hinder, common verb). And get first to land [prOtous
   eis ten gen exienai]. This classic verb [exeimi] occurs four times in
   Acts (13:42; 17:15; 20:7; 27:32) and nowhere else in the N.T. It was a
   wise command.

   27:44 Some on planks [hous men epi sanisin]. Common Greek idiom [hous
   men--hous de] for "some--some." The only N.T. instance of the old Greek
   word [sanis] for board or plank. The breaking of the ship gave scraps
   of timber which some used. They all escaped safe [pantas diasOthenai].
   First aorist passive infinitive of [diasOzO] (the very word used for
   the desire of the centurion about Paul) with accusative of general
   reference, the clause being subject of [egeneto]. So Luke in this
   marvellous narrative, worthy of any historian in any age, shows how
   Paul's promise was fulfilled (verse 24). Paul the prisoner is the hero
   of the voyage and shipwreck, a wonderful example of God's providential
   care.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 28

   28:1 Then we knew [tote epegnOmen]. Second aorist (ingressive) active
   indicative of [epiginOskO]. Then we recognized. See 27:39. Was called
   [kaleitai]. Present passive indicative retained in indirect discourse.
   Melita [Melite]. Not [Miletene] as only B reads, a clerical error, but
   retained in the text of Westcott and Hort because of B. Page notes that
   the island was Malta as is shown from the name, the location, the
   presence of a ship from Alexandria bound for Rome wintering there
   (verse 11), and the mention of Syracuse as the next stop after leaving
   (verse 12).

   28:2 The barbarians [hoi barbaroi]. The Greeks called all men
   "barbarians" who did not speak Greek (Ro 1:14), not "barbarians" in our
   sense of rude and uncivilized, but simply "foreign folk." Diodorus
   Siculus (V. 12) says that it was a colony of the Phoenicians and so
   their language was Punic (Page). The word originally meant an uncouth
   repetition [barbar] not understood by others (1Co 14:11). In Col 3:11
   Paul couples it with Scythian as certainly not Christian. These are
   (with verse 4 below) the only N.T. instances. Showed us [pareichan].
   Imperfect active of [parechO] with [-an] instead of [-on] as [eichan]
   in Mr 8:7 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 339). It was their habit on this
   occasion, Luke means, they kept on showing. No common kindness [ou ten
   tuchousan philanthrOpian]. The old word [philanthrOpia] [philos],
   [anthrOpos], love of mankind, occurs in the N.T. only here and Tit 3:4
   (adverb in 27:3). See on 19:11 for this use of [ou ten tuchousan], "not
   the kindness that happens every day." They were not "wreckers" to take
   advantage of the calamity. They kindled a fire [hapsantes puran]. The
   only N.T. example and verse 3 of the old word [pura] (from [pur],
   fire), a pile of burning fuel (sticks). First aorist active participle
   of [haptO], to set fire to, to kindle. Cf. [anaptO] in Lu 12:49.
   Received us all [proselabonto pantas hemas]. Second aorist middle
   (indirect indicative of [proslambanO].) They took us all to themselves
   (cf. Ac 18:26). The present [ton ephestOta]. Second perfect active
   participle (intransitive) of [ephistemi], "the rain that stood upon
   them" (the pouring rain). Only in Luke and Paul in N.T.

   28:3 When Paul had gathered [sustrepsantos tou Paulou]. Genitive
   absolute with first aorist active participle of [sustrephO], old verb
   to twist or turn together or roll into a bundle. In N.T. only here and
   Mt 17:22. A bundle of sticks [phruganOn ti plethos]. "Some multitude
   (or pile) of dry twigs" [phruganOn] from [phrugO] or [phrussO], to dry.
   Only here in N.T.). Laid [epithentos]. So genitive absolute again with
   second aorist active participle of [epitithemi], to place upon. Few
   things show Paul to better advantage than this incident. By reason of
   the heat [apo tes thermes]. Old word, only here in N.T. Ablative case
   with [apo] (from the heat). The viper was in a state of torpor in the
   bundle of sticks. The heat wakened him. A viper [echidna]. The old word
   used by the Baptist of the Pharisees (Mt 3:7; Lu 3:7) and by Jesus also
   (Mt 12:34; 23:33). It is objected that there is little wood in the
   island today and no vipers, though Lewin as late as 1853 believes that
   he saw a viper near St. Paul's Bay. But the island now has 1,200 people
   to the square mile and snakes of any kind have a poor chance. The viper
   has also disappeared from Arran as the island became more frequented
   (Knowling). Ramsay thinks that the small constrictor (Coronella
   Austriaca) which still exists in the island may be the "viper," though
   it has no poison fangs, but clings and bites. The natives thought that
   it was a poisonous viper. Fastened on his hand [kathepse tes cheiros
   autou]. First aorist active indicative of [kathaptO], to fasten down on
   with the genitive case. Old verb, here only in N.T. Cf. Mr 16:18.

   28:4 The beast [to therion]. Diminutive of [ther] and so little beast.
   See on Mr 1:13. Aristotle and the medical writers apply the word to
   venomous serpents, the viper in particular (Knowling), as Luke does
   here. Vincent calls attention to the curious history of our word
   "treacle" for molasses (Latin theriaca) from [theriake], an antidote
   made from the flesh of vipers. Coverdale translates Jer 8:22: "There is
   no more treacle in Gilead." Jeremy Taylor: "We kill the viper and make
   treacle of him." Hanging from his hand [kremamenon ek tes cheiros
   autou]. Vivid picture of the snake dangling from Paul's hand. Present
   middle participle of [kremamai], late form for [kremannumi], to hang
   up, to suspend (cf. Ga 3:13). No doubt [pantOs]. Literally, By all
   means, old adverb. Cf. 21:22; Lu 4:23; 1Co 9:22. Only by Luke and Paul
   in the N.T. "They knew that he was a prisoner being taken to Rome on
   some grave charge, and inferred that the charge was murder" (Page).
   Though he hath escaped [diasOthenta]. First aorist passive participle
   of [diasOzO] (same verb used in 24:43, 44; 28:1), so-called concessive
   use of the participle (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1129). Yet Justice
   [dike]. An abstraction personified like the Latin Justitia (Page). The
   natives speak of [Dike] as a goddess, but we know nothing of such
   actual worship in Malta, though the Greeks worshipped abstractions as
   in Athens. Hath not suffered [ouk eiasen]. Did not suffer. They look on
   Paul as a doomed man as good as dead. These people thought that
   calamity was proof of guilt, poor philosophy and worse theology.

   28:5 Shook off [apotinaxas]. First aorist active participle of
   [apotinassO], to shake off. Rare word (Euripides, Galen, LXX). In N.T.
   only here and Lu 9:5.

   28:6 But they expected [hoi de prosedokOn]. Imperfect active, were
   expecting, continued to expect. That he would have swollen [auton
   mellein pimprasthai]. More exactly, "Expecting him to be about (or that
   he was about) to swell up." [Pimprasthai] is present middle infinitive
   from [pimpremi], to blow, to burn, to inflame, to cause to swell.
   [PrethO], to swell, seems connected and both use the aorist [epresa].
   Our word "inflammation" likewise means a burning and a swelling. This
   verb is a common medical term used as Luke has it. It occurs here only
   in N.T. Or fallen down dead suddenly [e katapiptein aphnO nekron].
   Rather, "or was about to fall down dead suddenly." The two common
   results of a bite by a viper or other poisonous snake, both medical
   terms used by Luke. But when they were long in expectation [epi polu de
   autOn prosdokOntOn]. Genitive absolute. "But while they were expecting
   for much time." Nothing amiss come to him [meden atopon eis auton
   ginomenon]. "Nothing out of place coming to him" (present middle
   participle). [Meden] the usual negative of the participle and the
   accusative case the object of [theOrountOn] (genitive absolute).
   Changed their minds [metabalomenoi]. Aorist middle (direct) participle
   of [metaballO], old verb to turn about or around, turning themselves
   about, changing their minds. Plato uses this very verb in middle voice
   for changing the mind. That he was a god [auton einai theon].
   Accusative and infinitive in indirect discourse. At Lystra Paul was
   first received as a god (Mercury) and then they stoned him to kill him
   (Ac 14:11, 19). So fickle is popular favour.

   28:7 To the chief man of the island [tOi prOtOi tes nesou]. An official
   title correct in Malta (Ramsay, St. Paul, p. 343). An inscription in
   Malta calls Prudens "Primate of the Maltese" [prOtos MelitaiOn]. Here
   it is plainly a title and not the common use seen in 13:50; 25:2;
   28:17. Publius [PopliOi]. This Greek name [praenomen] can be derived
   either from [Popilius] or [Publius] (cf. [publicus] for [populicus]
   from [populus]. Entertained us [exenisen hemas]. Paul and his
   companions (Luke and Aristarchus). Was Julius included? On [xenizO] see
   Ac 10:23. Courteously [philophronOs]. This old adverb from [philophrOn]
   [philos, phren], friendly mind) occurs here alone in the N.T. In a
   kindly or friendly manner, all the more so because of the original
   suspicion of Paul as a criminal.

   28:8 Lay [katakeisthai]. Common verb for the sick (Mr 1:30; Joh 5:6).
   Sick [sunechomenon]. "Held together." Common verb again for the sick as
   in Lu 4:38. Of fever [puretois]. Instrumental case, and plural
   "fevers," medical term for intermittent attacks of fever (Demosthenes,
   Lucian, medical writers). Dysentery [dusenteriOi]. Instrumental case
   also. Late form of the older [dusenteria] and only here in N.T. Our
   very word dysentery. Another medical term of which Luke uses so many.
   Hippocrates often mentions these two diseases together. Laying his
   hands on him healed him [epitheis tas cheiras autOi iasato auton].
   Either like the laying on of hands in Jas 5:14, the gift of healing
   (1Co 12:9f.), or the tender interest of Jesus when he took hold of the
   hand of Peter's mother-in-law (Mr 1:31). Ramsay argues that [iaomai] is
   employed here of the miraculous healing by Paul while [therapeuO] is
   used of the cures by Luke the physician (verse 9). This is a general
   distinction and it is probably observed here, but in Lu 6:18 (which
   see) both verbs are employed of the healings by Jesus. Came and were
   healed [proserchonto kai etherapeuonto]. Imperfect middle and imperfect
   passive. A regular stream of patients came during these months. Luke
   had his share in the honours, "us" [hemas], and no doubt his share in
   the cures. With many honours [pollais timais]. Instrumental case. The
   word was often applied to payment for professional services as we today
   speak of an honorarium. They put on board [epethento]. Second aorist
   middle indicative of [epitithemi], to put on. The idea of "on board" is
   merely suggested by [anagomenois] (when we sailed) "the things for our
   needs" [ta pros tas chreias].

   28:11 Which had wintered [parakecheimakoti]. Perfect active participle
   of [paracheimazO], to pass the winter. Old verb, in N.T. only 27:12;
   28:11; 1Co 16:6; Tit 3:12. The locative case agreeing with [ploiOi].
   Navigation in the Mediterranean usually opened up in February (always
   by March), spring beginning on Feb. 9 (Page). Whose sign was the Twin
   Brothers [parasemOi Dioskourois]. The word [parasemOi] can be either a
   substantive (as Revised Version has it) or an adjective "marked by the
   sign," examples of both uses common in ancient Greek. [Dioskourois] is
   in apposition with [parasemOi]. The word means the twin sons [kouros]
   or [koros] of Zeus [Dios], genitive of [Zeus] and Leda, viz., Castor
   and Pollux. The Attic used the dual, [tO DioskorO]. Castor and Pollux
   were the tutelary deities of sailors whose figures were painted one on
   each side of the prow of the ship. This sign was the name of the ship.
   So they start in another grain ship of Alexandria bound for Rome.

   28:12 Touching [katachthentes]. First aorist passive participle of
   [katagO], to go down to land, just the opposite of [anechthemen] in
   verse 11 from [anagO], to go up to sea. At Syracuse [eis Surakousas].
   The chief city of Sicily and eighty miles from Malta. Perhaps open
   weather and a southerly wind helped them across. Here it was that
   Alcibiades wrecked the power and glory of Athens. Why the ship spent
   three days we do not know.

   28:13 We made a circuit [perielthontes]. Second aorist active of
   [perierchomai], to go around, old verb, already in 19:13. See also Heb
   11:37; 1Ti 5:13. But Westcott and Hort read [perielontes] after Aleph B
   (from [periaireO] as in 27:40, though here it could only mean casting
   loose, for which no other authority exists. At any rate the ship had to
   tack to reach Rhegium and was not able to make a straight course
   [enthudromeO], 16:11). Rhegium [Rhegion] is from [rhegnumi], to break
   off, the place where the land breaks off, the southern entrance to the
   straits of Messina. A south wind sprang up [epigenomenou notou].
   Genitive absolute again, and for all the world like that fatal south
   wind in 27:13, but with no bad results this time, though the weather
   was plainly treacherous at this early season. On the second day
   [deuteraioi]. This is the classical use of the predicate adjective, "We
   second day men" as in Lu 24:22; Joh 11:39; Php 3:5 instead of the
   adverb (Robertson, Grammar, p. 657). To Puteoli [eis Potiolous]. It was
   182 miles from Rhegium and would require 26 hours (Page). It was eight
   miles northwest from Neapolis (Naples) and the chief port of Rome, the
   regular harbour for the Alexandrian ships from Rome. Portions of the
   great mole are said to be still visible.

   28:14 Where we found brethren [hou heurontes adelphous]. Possibly from
   Alexandria, but, as Blass observes, it is no more strange to find
   "brethren" in Christ in Puteoli when Paul arrives than in Rome. There
   was a large Jewish quarter. Seven days [hemeras hepta]. Accusative of
   extent of time. Paul and his party remained so long at the urgent
   request of the brethren. He was still a prisoner, but clearly Julius
   was only too glad to show another courtesy to Paul to whom they all
   owed their lives. It was 130 miles by land from Puteoli to Rome over
   one of the great Roman roads. And so we came to Rome [kai houtOs eis
   ten Romen elthamen]. So at last. Luke is exultant as Page observes:
   Paulus Romae captivus: triumphus unicus. It is the climax of the book
   of Acts (19:21; 23:11), but not the close of Paul's career. Page
   rightly remarks that a new paragraph should begin with verse 15, for
   brethren came from Rome and this part of the journey is touched with
   the flavour of that incident. The great event is that Paul reached
   Rome, but not as he had once hoped (Ro 15:22-29).

   28:15 When they heard of us [akousantes ta peri hemOn]. How "they heard
   the things concerning us" we do not know. Good news had its way of
   travel even before the days of telegraph, telephone, daily papers.
   Possibly Julius had to send on special couriers with news of his
   arrival after the shipwreck. Possibly some of the brethren in Puteoli
   at once (beginning of the week) sent on news to the brethren in Rome.
   The church in Rome had long ago received Paul's letter from Corinth at
   the hands of Phoebe. To meet us [eis apantesin hemin]. Idiomatic
   phrase, "for meeting with us" (associative instrumental case). Koine
   word [apantesis] from verb [apantaO], to meet, in N.T. only here; Mt
   25:6; 1Ti 4:17. Use after [eis] rather than infinitive like a
   translation Hebraism (Robertson, Grammar, p. 91). As far as the Market
   of Appius [achri Appiou Phorou]. The Forum of Appius, 90 miles from
   Puteoli, 40 from Rome, on the great Appian Way. The Censor Appius
   Claudius had constructed this part of the road, B.C. 312. Paul probably
   struck the Appian Way at Capua. Portions of this great stone highway
   are still in use. If one wishes to tread where Paul trod, he can do it
   here. Appii Forum had a bad reputation, the haunt of thieves, thugs,
   and swindlers. What would this motley crowd think of Paul chained to a
   soldier? Three Taverns [TriOn TabernOn]. Genitive case after [achri]
   like [Appiou Phorou]. About 30 miles from Rome. Tres Tabernae. Whom
   [hous]. Two groups of the disciples came (one Gentile, one Jewish,
   Rackham thinks), one to Appii Forum, the other to Three Taverns. It was
   a joyous time and Julius would not interfere. Took courage [elabe
   tharsos]. The old substantive [tharsos] is here alone in the N.T. Jesus
   himself had exhorted Paul to be of good courage [tharsei] Ac 23:11) as
   he had done the disciples (Joh 16:33). Paul had passed through enough
   to cause depression, whether he was depressed or not, but he deeply
   appreciated this kindly sympathy.

   28:16 Paul was suffered to abide by himself [epetrape tOi PaulOi menein
   kath' heauton]. Second aorist passive of [epitrepo], to permit or
   allow. Literally, "It was permitted to Paul to abide by himself." Some
   late documents (Textus Receptus) here add: "The centurion delivered the
   prisoners to the captain of the guard" (or the [stratopedarch]. This
   officer used to be considered Burrus who was Prefect of the Praetorian
   Guard A.D. 51-62. But it is by no means certain that Julius turned the
   prisoners over to this officer. It seems more likely that Julius would
   report to the captain of the Peregrini. If so, we may be sure that
   Julius would give a good report of Paul to this officer who would be
   kindly disposed and would allow Paul comparative freedom (living by
   himself, in his lodging, verse 23, his own hired house verse 30, though
   still chained to a soldier). With the soldier that guarded him [sun tOi
   phulassonti auton stratiOtei]. Probably a new soldier every day or
   night, but always with this soldier chained to his right hand day and
   night. Now that Paul is in Rome what can he do for Christ while he
   awaits the outcome of his own appeal to Nero?

   28:17 Those that were the chief of the Jews [tous ontas tOn IoudaiOn
   prOtous]. This use of [prOtos] for the leading men of a city or among
   the Jews we have already had in 13:50; 25:2; Lu 19:47. Literally,
   "Those that were first among the Jews." The position of the participle
   [ontas] between the article and the adjective [prOtous] is regular
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 777). When they were come together
   [sunelthontOn autOn]. Genitive absolute again. Paul could not go to the
   synagogue, as his custom was, being a bound prisoner. So he invited the
   Jewish leaders to come to his lodging and hear his explanation of his
   presence in Rome as a prisoner with an appeal to Caesar. He is anxious
   that they may understand that this appeal was forced upon him by Festus
   following Felix and lot because he has come to make an attack on the
   Jewish people. He was sure that false reports had come to Rome. These
   non-Christian Jews accepted Paul's invitation. Nothing against [ouden
   enantion]. Adjective here as in 26:9, not preposition as in 7:10; 8:32.
   From [en] and [antios] [anti], face to face. Concessive participle
   [poiesas] as in verse 4 [diasOthenta] which see. Yet was I delivered
   prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans [desmios ex
   IerosolumOn paredothen eis tas cheiras tOn RomaiOn]. This condensed
   statement does not explain how he "was delivered," for in fact the Jews
   were trying to kill him when Lysias rescued him from the mob
   (22:27-36). The Jews were responsible for his being in the hands of the
   Romans, though they had hoped to kill him first.

   28:18 When they had examined me [anakrinantes me]. First aorist active
   participle of [anakrinO], the same verb used already in 24:8; 25:6, 26
   of the judicial examinations by Felix and Festus. Desired [eboulonto].
   Imperfect middle of attempted action or picture of their real attitude.
   This is a correct statement as the words of both Felix and Festus show.
   Because there was [dia to--huparchein]. Accusative case with [dia]
   (causal use) with the articular infinitive, "Because of the being no
   cause of death in me" [en emoi], in my case, [aitia], usual word for
   crime or charge of crime).

   28:19 When the Jews spake against it [antilegontOn tOn IoudaiOn].
   Genitive absolute again, [antilegontOn] [antilegO] common verb for
   speaking against as in 13:45. Clementer dicit (Bengel). "The word is a
   mild one to describe the bitter enmity of the Jews" (Knowling). I was
   constrained [enagkasthen]. "I was compelled," first aorist passive
   indicative of [anagkazO], the very word used of Paul's efforts to get
   the Christians to blaspheme (26:11) which see. Paul was compelled to
   appeal to Caesar (see 25:11, 12 for this phrase), unless Paul was
   willing to be the victim of Jewish hate when he had done no wrong. Not
   that I had aught to accuse my nation of [ouch hOs tou ethnous mou echOn
   ti kategorein]. This use of [hOs] with a participle [echOn] is common
   in Greek for the alleged reason. The genitive case with the infinitive
   [kategorein] is regular. Paul says [ethnos] instead of [laos] as in
   24:17; 26:4.

   28:20 Did I intreat [parekalesa]. Did I invite you. Because of the hope
   of Israel [heineken tes elpidos tou Israel]. Genitive with preposition
   [heineken]. The hope of the Messiah is his point as in 26:6. I am bound
   with this chain [ten halusin tauten perikeimai]. This old verb means to
   lie around as in Lu 17:2; Heb 12:1. But it is also used as the passive
   of [peritithemi], to place around with the accusative of [peritithemi]
   retained. It is a transitive passive. Paul does not lie around the
   chain, but the chain lies around him, a curious reversal of the imagery
   (Robertson, Grammar, p. 815).

   28:21 Letters [grammata]. Official documents from the Sanhedrin about
   the charges against Paul. Any harm of thee [ti peri sou poneron]. Evil
   [poneron]. The three aorists [edexametha, apeggeilen, elalesen] cover
   the past. These Jews do not mean to say that they had never heard of
   Paul. It is hardly likely that they had heard of his appeal to Caesar,
   "for how could the news have reached Rome before Paul?" (Page).

   28:22 But we desire [axioumen de]. Old verb [axioO], to deem worthy, to
   think right or proper as in 15:38 which see. They think it only fair to
   hear Paul's side of his case. Concerning this sect [peri tes haireseOs
   tautes]. Paul had identified Christianity with Judaism (verse 20) in
   its Messianic hope. The language seems to imply that the number of
   Christians in Rome was comparatively small and mainly Gentile. If the
   edict of Claudius for the expulsion of the Jews from Rome (Ac 18:2) was
   due to disturbance over Christ [Chrestus], then even in Rome the Jews
   had special reason for hostility towards Christians. Everywhere spoken
   against [pantachou antilegetai]. Cf. verse 19. The line of cleavage
   between Jew and Christian was now sharply drawn everywhere.

   28:23 Appointed [taxamenoi]. First aorist middle participle of [tassO].
   Formal arrangement as in Mt 28:16 when Jesus appointed the mountain for
   his meeting in Galilee. In great number [pleiones]. Comparative of
   [polus], "more than a few." Expounded [exetitheto]. Imperfect middle of
   [ektithemi], to set forth, as in 11:4; 18:26. He did it with detail and
   care and spent all day at it, "from morning till evening" [apo prOi
   heOs hesperas]. In N.T. only here, 4:3 and Lu 24:29, though common
   word. Persuading them concerning Jesus [peithOn autous peri tou Iesou].
   Conative present active participle, trying to persuade. It was only
   about Jesus that he could make good his claim concerning the hope of
   Israel (verse 20). It was Paul's great opportunity. So he appealed both
   to Moses and to the prophets for proof as it was his custom to do.

   28:24 Some believed [hoi men epeithonto]. Imperfect passive indicative
   of [peithO]. More exactly, "some began to be persuaded" (inchoative).
   Some disbelieved [hoi de epistoun]. Imperfect active of [apisteO], to
   disbelieve, continued to disbelieve. It is usually so.

   28:25 When they agreed not [asumphOnoi ontes]. Old adjective, only here
   in N.T., double compound [a] privative, [sum, phOne], without symphony,
   out of harmony, dissonant, discordant. It was a triumph to gain
   adherents at all in such an audience. They departed [apeluonto].
   Imperfect middle (direct) indicative, "They loosed themselves from
   Paul." Graphic close. After that Paul had spoken one word [eipontos tou
   Paulou rhema hen]. Genitive absolute. One last word (like a preacher)
   after the all day exposition. Well [kalOs]. Cf. Mt 14:7; Mr 7:6, 9
   (irony). Here strong indignation in the very position of the word
   (Page). To your fathers [pros tous pateras humOn]. So Aleph A B instead
   of [hemOn] (our) like Stephen in 7:52 whose words Paul had heard. By
   mentioning the Holy Spirit Paul shows (Knowling) that they are
   resisting God (7:52).

   28:26 Say [eipon]. Second aorist active imperative instead of the old
   form [eipe]. The quotation is from Isa 6:9,10. This very passage is
   quoted by Jesus (Mt 13:14,15; Mr 4:12; Lu 8:10) in explanation of his
   use of parables and in Joh 12:40 the very point made by Paul here, "the
   disbelief of the Jews in Jesus" (Page). See on Matthew for discussion
   of the language used. Here the first time ("go to this people and say")
   does not occur in Matthew. It is a solemn dirge of the doom of the Jews
   for their rejection of the Messiah foreseen so long ago by Isaiah.

   28:28 This salvation [touto to sOterion]. Adjective from [sOter]
   (Saviour), saving, bringing salvation. Common in the old Greek. The
   neuter as here often in LXX (as Ps 67:2) as substantive like [sOteria]
   (cf. Lu 3:6). They will also hear [autoi kai akousontai]. [Autoi] as
   opposed to the rejection by the Jews, "vivid and antithetical" (Page).

   28:30 Two whole years [dietian holen]. Only here in N.T. and 24:27
   which see. During these busy years in Rome Paul wrote Philippians,
   Philemon, Colossians, Ephesians, Epistles that would immortalize any
   man, unless, forsooth, one or more of them was written from Ephesus or
   Caesarea, which has not yet been proven. In his own hired dwelling [en
   idiOi misthOmati]. Old word, here only in N.T., that which is hired for
   a price (from [misthoO] and that from [misthos], hire). Received
   [apedecheto]. Imperfect middle of [apodechomai], received from time to
   time as they came, all that came [eisporeuomenous] from time to time.
   Preaching [kerussOn], teaching [didaskOn], the two things that
   concerned Paul most, doing both as if his right hand was not in chains,
   to the amazement of those in Rome and in Philippi (Php 1:12-14). None
   forbidding him [akOlutOs]. Old adverb from [a] privative and the verbal
   adjective [kOlutos] (from [kOluO], to hinder), here only in the N.T.
   Page comments on "the rhythmic cadence of the concluding words." Page
   rejects the notion that the book is an unfinished work. It closes with
   the style of a concluded work. I agree with Harnack that Luke wrote the
   Acts during this period of two years in Rome and carried events no
   further because they had gone no further. Paul was still a prisoner in
   Rome when Luke completed the book. But he had carried Paul to "Rome,
   the capital of the world, Urbi et Orbi" (Page). The gospel of Christ
   has reached Rome. For the fate of Paul we must turn elsewhere. But Luke
   had the presence of Paul while he carried the Acts to its triumphant
   conclusion. Ramsay can give a good deal in proof of his claim that Luke
   is the greatest of all historians. Beyond a doubt his rank is high and
   the world can never repay its debt to this cultured physician who wrote
   the Gospel and the Acts.
