   The appearance of à Kempis's "Lives of Gerard Groote and his
   Followers," in an English garb, should be hailed by Catholics with
   satisfaction. The translation has been very carefully revised by the
   Prior of Downside, Fr. Leo Almond, O.S.B., and naught will be found in
   it but what is edifying. I trust that the book will have a wide
   circulation, presenting, as it does, one of the brightest pages in the
   history of an age in which there is much that is sombre.

PREFACE

   CONSIDERING the wide fame of Thomas à Kempis as the reputed author of
   "The Imitation of Christ" it is surprising that no English translation
   of the "Lives of Gerard Groote and his followers" has been published
   hitherto. (The Brotherhood of the Common Life to which à Kempis
   belonged owed its foundation to Groote and his pupil Florentius, and
   since that Brotherhood is referred to by the author himself as "The New
   Devotion," and Groote is called "Nostrae devotionis fundator," I have
   thought myself justified in giving to this translation the title which
   it bears, although the editio princeps gives no general title to the
   Lives.

   The version here presented does not claim to be savagely literal, but I
   hope that I have not misrepresented the author in any material point,
   and that the translation faithfully renders the meaning of the original
   Latin. In any case I have not intentionally distorted or omitted a
   single phrase.

   An introductory chapter has been added, giving a brief and imperfect
   résumé of the conditions under which Groote and his followers lived,
   together with certain notes dealing with matters to which the text
   refers.

   My cordial thanks are due to several friends who have assisted me,
   especially to the Rev. S. H. Gem, for many valuable suggestions and
   references, and to M. P. S. Allen for similar help. I am happy in
   having this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the Very Reverend
   Leo Almond, Prior of Downside Abbey, who has been good enough to read
   my manuscript and to give me much information on technical points.

INTRODUCTION

   THE period covered by the Lives of Gerard Groote and his followers is
   the hundred years which elapsed between 1340, the date of Groote's
   birth, and 1439, the year in which Henry Brune died. In order to
   understand the significance of the movement to which à Kempis has given
   the name of "The New Devotion," it is necessary briefly to consider the
   conditions which prevailed at the time when that movement was initiated
   and the difficulties with which its adherents had to contend.

   At the time of Groote's birth the Low Countries were divided into a
   number of small principalities, each of which was governed by its own
   Sovereign: of these the most powerful were the Counts of Holland and
   the Prince Bishops of Utrecht, who as Motley says, "divided between
   them the Sovereignty of what afterwards became the United States of the
   Netherlands." By the death of William IV of Holland in 1355) that
   country was plunged into a whirpool of civil discord which did not
   subside until 1437, when Philip of Burgundy, misnamed "The Good,"
   obtained undisputed possession of the supreme power.

   The Bishops of Utrecht, in addition to their spiritual authority,
   enjoyed a large amount of temporal power, and were for many centuries
   the most formidable of the opponents to the Counts of Holland. The
   Bishopric was founded by Charles Martell in the eighth century, that
   prince having rewarded the Anglo-Saxon monk, Willibrord, with large
   possessions in the neighbourhood of the town from which the See is
   named, in recognition of his labours on behalf of the Faith. Winfred or
   Bonifacius who succeeded, received further accessions of territory, and
   by his efforts and his martyr's death at Dokkum, Christianity was
   established yet more firmly in the Netherlands, The power of his
   successors, the later Bishops, gradually but continually increased, and
   since in earlier years the authority of these prelates was frequently
   exercised in the defence of the people against oppression, it rested
   upon a foundation surer than any which could be laid by Royal Grant or
   Charter.

   The district of Overyssel with which we are more immediately concerned,
   though it formed a portion of the dominions of the prince Bishops,
   enjoyed at this time a certain measure of independence, being
   administered by a council composed of representatives of the nobility
   and of the three cities, Deventer, Kempen and Zwolle. The Bishop,
   indeed, presided over this council, but he seems to have allowed to its
   members complete freedom of decision upon any points which arose, and
   to have waived his rights of interference even in cases concerning
   clerks who dwelt in the three towns above named ("Belgii Confoederati
   Respub.," p. 254, Elzevir, 1630). But though the power of the Bishops
   had in earlier days afforded protection to the people, their government
   became more and more arbitrary and despotic, a result which was due to
   a variety of causes too complex to enumerate; certain points, however,
   must be borne in mind, of which perhaps the most important is the
   slight deference shown by these Bishops to their Spiritual Head. Some
   thirty-five years before our period begins, Clement V had removed the
   Papal Chair to Avignon, and thus he and his successors became unduly
   dependent upon the favour of the French Kings, and as a natural
   consequence the Papal authority was for the time greatly weakened. Of
   the Popes who reigned during the period under consideration the first
   five, namely, Benedict XII, Clement VI, Innocent VI, Urban V and
   Gregory XI, resided in France, but after the death of Gregory, the
   "Great Schism" broke out to still further relax the authority of the
   Holy See. It is impossible here to describe in detail the course of
   this unhappy feud, but since Groote is praised for his loyalty to Urban
   VI it is desirable to note the fact that the best authorities agree
   that the election of that Pontiff was regular, and that the action of
   the Cardinals who declared the election void was illegal. It should be
   remembered also that whereas the Popes named above were all of French
   nationality, Urban VI was an Italian, and that the Schism was due to
   political rather than to Religious considerations.

   The election of Urban took place in 1378, and in the same year certain
   of the Cardinals, claiming that the menaces of the Roman populace had
   hindered their freedom of choice, elected Robert of Geneva, who took
   the title of Clement VII. Urban refused to recognize his deposition and
   took up his residence at Rome, while Clement went to Avignon. Thus
   there were two claimants to the Papacy, a condition of things which not
   only weakened the Church by dividing Catholic Christendom into two
   parties, but also embittered the already existing civil and political
   strife. On the death of Urban VI the Italian party elected Boniface IX
   as his successor, and five years later Benedict XIII was chosen to
   succeed Clement at Avignon. Boniface was followed by Innocent VII, who,
   however, survived his election by two years only, and on his death the
   Italian Cardinals chose Angelo Corrario, who is known to History as
   Gregory XII. This pontiff and Benedict undertook to resign their claims
   if such resignation should seem likely to promote the peace of the
   church, but as events proved neither was willing to carry out his
   promise, and in 1409 nine of the Cardinals who had supported Benedict
   made common cause with the Italian party, and the latter being thus
   strengthened, convoked the Council of Pisa which condemned and deposed
   both Popes, and chose John of Candia, who took the name of Alexander V.
   The deposed Pontiffs, however, refused to recognize the validity of
   this sentence, so that there were now three claimants to St. Peter's
   Throne, and although Alexander died in 1410, the strife of parties was
   not thereby lessened, since the sixteen Cardinals who had elected him
   now chose in his place another Italian who is known as John XXIII. He
   it was who in 1414 convoked the council of Constance, perhaps expecting
   that Council to support his pretensions and depose his rivals, but if
   this was his expectation it was disappointed, for by the unanimous vote
   of the Council John was himself deposed, and shortly afterwards Gregory
   expressed his willingness to resign. Sentence of deposition was
   subsequently passed upon Benedict, who, however, continued to claim,
   and so far as he could to exercise, the Papal authority until his death
   in 1423, when the two Cardinals who had continued to support him chose
   Clement VIII in his place. Meanwhile the Council of Constance had
   chosen Otto de Colonna, who as Martin V succeeded in healing the
   Schism, for in 1429 Clement, the last of the Anti-Popes, was persuaded
   to resign.

   In view of the complexity of these proceedings it may be convenient to
   append a table of the Popes who reigned during the period under
   discussion, the names of Anti-Popes being in italics:

                                }
                  Martin V

   Besides the Schism other causes tended to weaken the Papal authority in
   the country with which we have to deal. The Bishops of Utrecht were
   dependent rather upon the favour of the Emperor than upon that of the
   Pope, and even during the years which marked the increase of the Papal
   authority throughout Europe, there are many instances of strong
   resistance being offered to it both in the Low Countries and elsewhere
   in Northern Europe. Heresy, as Motley has pointed out, was a plant of
   early growth in the Netherlands, and "from the earliest times neither
   Prince, People nor even Prelates had been very dutiful to the Pope."
   Students of history will remember many instances of resistance to the
   Papal claims in England, especially during the reigns of Edward III.
   and his immediate successors, and as early as 1413 the feeling of the
   people against the clergy led the commons to petition Henry V. to seize
   certain revenues of the Church, and apply them to the service of the
   State.

   It is necessary, however, to go back to an earlier period than this in
   order to trace the development of the feeling of which such acts were
   the outcome, and it is impossible to deny that ecclesiastical
   dignitaries and the subordinate clergy gave many provocations to the
   civil power and to the people at large in the years which preceded the
   time of which we speak.

   As early as the beginning of the twelfth century the notorious
   Tanchelyn, an illiterate impostor, caused great commotion in Brabant by
   his denunciations of the clergy, and although his utterances were
   blasphemous and his conduct was grotesquely indecent, he gained for a
   time a considerable following, a result which could hardly have
   occurred had there been no substratum of truth in the protest which he
   made against clerical domination. During the progress of the same
   century other teachers arose to cause divisions and strife in the
   Church to which they professed allegiance, and, naturally enough,
   persecution followed, to be attended as usual by a yet more luxuriant
   growth in that which it strove to eradicate. By the end of the
   thirteenth century the clerical power had begun to decline. The
   enormous wealth of the Church aroused the cupidity of the civil power,
   and the depravity of many clerks excited the indignation of thoughtful
   men. Even those who would not consent to rob the Church of her
   possessions, were forced to admit that the influence of great wealth
   was not wholly for good: that luxurious indolence was too often the
   effect of it: and that the austerity of life and sobriety of conduit
   which marked certain sects which were regarded as heretical, could not
   but give those sects a firm hold upon the minds of the people. It was
   perhaps to this feeling that the great popularity of the mendicant
   orders was due, but in any case that popularity grew continuously
   throughout the thirteenth century, and the orders themselves multiplied
   to an extent so inconvenient that the council of Lyons in 1274 had
   decreed the suppression of all such orders as had sprung up since the
   Pontificate of Innocent III. Thus four mendicant orders only were left,
   namely, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Carmelites and the Hermits
   of St. Augustine, and the reputation for sanctity enjoyed by these
   orders was such that it became a common practice for testators to
   provide in their wills that their bodies should be wrapped in a
   Dominican or Franciscan habit, in the hope of thereby obtaining mercy
   in the Day of Judgement. This popularity, however, was followed by a
   reaction; thus in our own country Richard of Armagh and others attacked
   the authority of the mendicants, and it was to his opposition to them
   that Wyclif owed the sentence of deprivation that was passed on him. In
   addition to the effect of such attacks from without, the societies were
   also weakened by internal dissensions, many of which appear to the
   modern reader as frivolous and puerile, being based upon philosophical
   rather than upon religious differences, though others had their origin
   in more serious matters. It is, however, only necessary for our purpose
   to remind the reader of the bitter quarrels between the different
   sections of Franciscans and of the long feud between the latter and the
   Dominicans.

   Amongst other religious bodies which flourished during this period are
   the Lollards and Béguines, of whom it is necessary to make special
   mention, as they are referred to in the Lives. The former name is
   constantly used by English writers as if it were descriptive of the
   followers of Wyclif only, whereas the term is applied by other authors
   to the Franciscan Tertiaries, the Cellites, the Brothers of the Common
   Life, and many others. The term Lollard with its variants, Lollhard,
   Lullhard, Lollert and Lullert means primarily "a singer," and denotes
   one who is constantly singing hymns to God. Thus it is applied to
   various bodies, without reference to the orthodoxy of their opinions.
   This explains the use of the word in the text where it is used in its
   literal signification, although the name had already become a term of
   reproach in consequence of their hypocrisy and pernicious sentiments
   that were attributed to many persons who professed extraordinary piety.
   Thus Hocsemius, a Canon of Liége, writing of the year 1309, says,
   "certain strolling hypocrites who were called Lollards or praisers of
   God,' deceived persons of quality" ("Gesta Pontif. Leod.," ii, 350).

   The name "Béguine" is also of somewhat uncertain signification, being
   applied both to that body which owed its origin to an austere branch of
   the Franciscan order, and also to certain German and Belgic societies
   which flourished during the thirteenth and following centuries. It is
   with the latter only that we have to do, and it is sufficient for our
   purpose to say that though it has been shown that certain societies
   called by this name were established in Holland and Flanders as early
   as the eleventh century, it was not until the thirteenth that they
   gained any great celebrity. It appears that a number of pious women
   associated themselves together and lived under the rule of a superior
   of their own sex, dividing their time between devotional exercises and
   honest labour. They did not, however, bind themselves by vows, but were
   at liberty to quit the society or to marry if so disposed. The name
   Béguine means--like Beghard--"one who is assiduous in prayer," and
   having been used at first of pious persons generally, became afterwards
   applied to the societies above mentioned. After a period of prosperity
   which lasted until the early part of the fourteenth century the
   Béguines fell into disrepute, and although John XXII and his successors
   afforded them some protection they continued to fall both in wealth and
   prosperity, because as it would seem they were supposed to have been
   corrupted by the infamous opinions of the Brethren of the Free Spirit.
   Hence it is that we find the name used in the Life of Florentius as a
   term of reproach. This period, marked as it was by civil and religious
   discord, was of course favourable to the production of fanatic
   enthusiasts and visionaries, such as the Flagellants who caused some
   commotion in 1340, and the Dancers who disturbed the Netherlands in
   1373. Somewhat later, but still during our period, arose the Brothers
   and Sisters of the Free Spirit, the Men of Understanding, and other
   sects, all of which added to the disorder of this unhappy time, and
   disturbed in a special degree the country in which Groote and his
   followers lived.

   Although the explosion caused by the condemnation of Huss took place in
   another land, its echoes were heard and some of its effects felt in
   Holland and the surrounding districts. Huss was condemned and suffered
   in 1415? and his friend Jerome of Prague in the following year; but the
   religious dissensions and the barbarous war which they caused continued
   to disturb further an already distracted world, until Æneas Sylvius,
   the emissary of the Council of Basel, succeeded in reconciling the more
   reasonable section of the Hussites to the Church, in 1433. Whatever
   view may be taken as to the justice or otherwise of the condemnation of
   the views of Huss, there can be no doubt that the demands of those of
   his followers who are known as Taborites were grossly extravagant, that
   their doctrines were grotesque and heretical, and that their conduct
   was at least as barbarous and cruel as that of their most fanatical
   opponents.

   It was not by actual heretics only that the peace of the Church was
   disturbed; various abuses had slowly developed, and were tolerated by
   many persons whose orthodoxy was never questioned. We need, however,
   deal only with those to which reference is made in the text.

   It will be observed that Groote lays great stress upon the evils of
   pluralism, and indeed the disastrous consequences of the
   non-enforcement of the Canons against this abuse must have been evident
   to all. According to Hallam ("Mid. Ages," c. 7, p. 2) there were cases
   of fifty, or even sixty benefices being held by a single incumbent, and
   in our own country it was found that in 1367 some clerks enjoyed more
   than twenty benefices. An abuse of a like nature was the holding by
   persons other than priests of ecclesiastical preferments. Thus Petrarch
   was enabled to enjoy the revenues of two benefices although he never
   took full orders. Closely connected with these abuses we find the crime
   of Simony, a term that, in the wider sense in which Groote uses it,
   must be taken to include many things besides the actual sale and
   purchase of benefices, such as the traffic in Indulgences which, as all
   who are conversant with the history of this period are aware, was
   lamentably common. Odious as is any traffic in the temporalities
   attached to spiritual cures, the Church has found great difficulty in
   suppressing it: as early as the eleventh century such simony was a
   reproach to the clergy in Holland and to the patrons "who made their
   powers of nomination and investiture subservient to their rapacity." By
   the ancient canons, indeed, a benefice was avoided by any simoniacal
   payment or stipulation, but for obvious reasons this law was seldom
   enforced; as time went on the practice became more and more common in
   spite of the protests of upright churchmen. In 1377 the English
   Parliament presented a petition to Edward III complaining of the greed
   of patrons, and in Germany, according to Sismondi, things were even
   worse than in England. Pope Urban VI owed no small part of his
   unpopularity with a section of churchmen to their fear that he would
   interfere with their illegitimate profits, and the council of Constance
   proposed to deal with this growing evil.

   A modern reader might perhaps feel some surprise at the severity with
   which Groote speaks of usurers, but it is well known that from very
   early times the practice of usury was regarded as criminal. In the year
   1179 Alexander III decreed that usurers "nec ad communionem recipiantur
   altaris, nec Christianam si in hoc peccato decesserint, accipiant
   sepulturam, sed nec oblationem eorum quisquam accipiat." So, too, in
   Spain the Inquisition took cognisance of usury, and long after the
   Reformation Anglican Divines continued to speak with horror of the
   practice--indeed, it may be doubted whether the prejudice against what
   is essentially a legitimate commercial transaction is even now dead,
   although the unanimous verdict of economists ought to have settled the
   question.

   It is unnecessary to comment upon the protest made by Groote against
   the grosser sins of his contemporaries, but no one who takes the
   trouble to examine the evidence can doubt that his protests were fully
   justified.

   Since many references are made in the Lives to Schools and
   Universities, it may be well to review briefly the state of learning
   during this period. The interest in classical studies, which had
   declined during the latter half of the thirteenth century, was revived
   to a great extent in the fourteenth, and during the lifetime of Groote
   and his followers many schools and universities were founded and became
   flourishing institutions, as, for example, at Cologne, Florence, Pisa,
   and Prague. The study of Greek, which had been neglected, was revived,
   owing to the influence of such scholars as Boccaccio, Petrarch, and
   Manuel Chrysolaras, and although the enthusiasm for classical learning
   was more marked in Italy than elsewhere, these great scholars had
   followers in Northern Europe as well as in their own land.

   Somewhat earlier than the period with which we deal, Clement V had
   given encouragement to the study of Hebrew and other Oriental
   languages, which he directed "should be taught in public schools that
   the Church might never lack a sufficient number of missionaries
   properly qualified to dispute with Jews and Mohammedans, and to diffuse
   the light of the gospel throughout the East." Mathematical study, which
   was regarded with some suspicion, owing to its supposed connection with
   astrology and magic, had been pursued with success by Thomas
   Bradwardine, Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1349), although the history
   of such enquirers as Cecco d'Ascoli hardly encouraged others to pursue
   that branch of knowledge. The University of Paris at which Groote
   studied was specially famous for Scholastic Theology, and it is
   interesting to note that Groote is said to have acquired great learning
   in Civil as well as Common law, although the study of the former was
   prohibited in that university: we know, however, from other sources
   that the prohibition was disregarded. The University of Prague, of
   which Florentius was a member, was not founded until 1350, but its
   repute grew rapidly and attracted many students, until, as Radius says
   ("Vita Thomae à Kempis," viii, § 7), "it became infected by heresy,"
   when it fell into disrepute with orthodox Catholics. The reference is,
   of course, to the Hussite troubles which had their origin here, Huss
   having persuaded the authorities to take away three votes from the
   German party in University elections. This produced a secession, to
   which the University of Leipsic owes its origin, and the ill feeling
   which the action of Huss aroused was no doubt one of the causes which
   led to his condemnation.

   Another great centre of learning was the school of Cologne, which is
   called by Angelius "the child of the University of Paris and the mother
   of that at Louvain." This institution was founded by Urban VI in 1388,
   while the academy at Louvain was raised to the dignity of an university
   by John IV of Brabant in 1423.

   Though we have some considerable knowledge as to the subjects taught
   and the methods pursued in the Universities during this period, very
   few records remain of school life. A Kempis himself, as he tells us in
   "The Life of Florentius," was a pupil in the school of Deventer, of
   which institution John Boheme was master; a notice of this school may
   be found in "De Laet. Belg. Descript," ed. 1630, p. 239, where we learn
   that the subjects taught were Philosophy, Theology, Hebrew, and Civil
   law. As to the methods adopted we may gather some information from the
   chronicles of Windesheim by Buschius, a contemporary of à Kempis. In
   this work there is an account of John Cele, who is mentioned in the
   life of Groote, and his biographer gives some account of the school of
   Zwolle of which Cele was master from 1376 to 1417. In all probability
   the schools at Zwolle and Deventer were managed on similar lines, so
   that Buschius' account of the former has some interest for us. Strict
   discipline seems to have been maintained among the eight hundred
   scholars, details of which may be found in the chronicle above-named,
   and in Kettlewell's work, entitled, "Thomas à Kempis and the Brothers
   of the Common Life." Further information about Cele himself may be
   derived from the chronicle of Mt. St. Agnes.

   The principle of Association which led to the formation of Trade Guilds
   in this part of the world was extended so as to include other
   interests, and to this principle was due the formation of the Guilds of
   Rhetoric which flourished in most of the principal towns. The
   importance for our purpose of such association is the influence they
   exercised over the people, for it is a remarkable fact that the
   cultivation of the arts and the pursuit of knowledge were during the
   fourteenth century by no means confined to the upper classes. During
   the time of which we speak the influence of these Guilds in the Low
   Countries was not so great as it afterwards became, but in France and
   Germany such associations had already considerable importance. Amongst
   other things the guilds encouraged theatrical performances, some of
   which were conducted in the churches, as, for instance, "King Herod and
   his Deeds," which was enacted in Utrecht Cathedral in 1418 (Motley,
   loc. cit.). Their efforts, however, were not confined to the exhibition
   of religious dramas, and it is not unlikely that the u idle amusements
   and spectacles "mentioned in the text were entertainments organized by
   these societies.

   Some reference must be made to the social condition of the people in
   the days of Groote and his followers. In spite of the disturbances
   which perpetually recurred, this was a period during which wealth
   accumulated with astonishing rapidity. The flourishing condition of the
   wool trade in Flanders, Brabant and Hainault was the chief cause of
   this prosperity, but the fisheries of Zeland and Holland also
   contributed to it. Cologne had long been a great trading centre, and as
   early as 122O the merchants of that city set up a factory in London.
   The opening of trade in the Baltic through the enterprise of the
   Hanseatic confederacy and the development of commercial intercourse
   with southern Europe during the fourteenth century also contributed to
   make this accumulation of wealth possible, and there can be no doubt
   that the Trade Guilds, to which reference has been made, assisted the
   merchants to resist the arbitrary measures of their nominal rulers and
   to amass riches which rivalled or surpassed those of the ancient
   nobility. Agriculture, too, had made considerable progress, largely
   owing to the efforts of the Religious Houses to which grants of waste
   land were made, and these being cleared and put under cultivation added
   largely to the wealth of the countries in which they were situated.

   The continuance of this prosperity appears the more remarkable when we
   consider the fact that throughout this period the countries of which we
   speak were devastated from time to time by visitations of the Plague
   and the Black Death; no less than six of the Brothers whose lives are
   here written died of these diseases, and à Kempis notes that many
   others of the community met with a like fate. The horrible pestilence
   called the Plague seems to have reached Europe from the Levant in 1346.
   A year or two later it ravaged France and England, and in 1350 appeared
   in an aggravated form in Germany and the Low Countries. Other severe
   visitations occurred in 1361, 1366, 1398, 1404 and 1439, and although
   we must receive with reserve the statements of contemporary chronicles
   as to the mortality caused by these pestilences, there can be no doubt
   that a considerable proportion of the population was swept off by them.
   According to Sismondi between four and five millions died in France
   alone during the first plague, and although some of the later epidemics
   appear to have been less deadly, the devastation caused by them cannot
   but have affected detrimentally the material progress of the country,
   and great misery must have resulted, especially amongst the poor, to
   whose service the Brothers of the Common Life specially devoted
   themselves.

   Another disease which scourged the country was leprosy, and this
   complaint is mentioned several times in the text. According to the
   greatest living authority leprosy is caused by a diet of more or less
   putrid fish. If this theory is correct, a country like that of which we
   speak would be likely to suffer, since in it fish formed the staple
   diet of many of the people, and in the inland parts especially salted
   fish was largely eaten, even on occasions when abstinence from flesh
   was not ordained.

   The existence in France of two thousand leper houses, and in Europe as
   a whole of nineteen thousand such establishments, shows how severe a
   scourge this complaint must have been (Sprengel, "Hist. de la
   Médicine," ii. 374, quoted by Buckle). The treatment to which the
   unfortunate victims of the disease were subjected added to the horror
   of their lot, and the action of the Brothers in ministering to them is
   the more laudable inasmuch as by so doing they ran counter to the
   prevailing prejudices and superstitions; for at this time--and indeed
   long afterwards--diseases in general and leprosy in particular were
   looked upon as indications of Divine wrath rather than as being due to
   natural causes. It appears that some of the Brothers had a knowledge of
   medicine, and though Groote deprecates the practice of this art it is
   probable that he was not altogether unacquainted with it; in any case
   he must have had the famous saying of Hippocrates in his mind when he
   laid down the rule "not to give remedies of doubtful virtue."

   It seems that the first suggestion for the formation of a Brotherhood
   came from Florentius (see Buschius Chr. of Windesheim), who with the
   assent of Groote gathered together a number of young clerks and
   copyists who were willing to live a Common Life. These persons took no
   formal vows, but undertook to obey such rules as might be drawn up from
   time to time for the government of the Community, and from this small
   beginning grew the Brotherhood of the Common. Life. Although the credit
   for this suggestion is due in part to Florentius, yet Groote himself
   had formerly desired to found a religious community. Lack of means,
   however, and the opposition of the existing Orders, which he foresaw,
   had hindered the execution of this design: the former difficulty was
   overcome by the generosity of one Lambert Stuerman, who by his will
   left a large sum of money at Groote's disposal; but Groote himself did
   not live long enough to carry out his desires. On his death-bed,
   however, he gave instructions to his followers to build and establish a
   House, and transfer to it such members of the original society as might
   desire to join. He particularly directed that this House should adopt
   the Rule of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine, assigning the
   following reasons for his decision. He did not desire, he said, that
   the members of the Order should be wholly separated from the world like
   the Carthusians, nor that the Rule under which they lived should be as
   severe as that of the Cistercians. On the other hand, he was aware of
   the advantage to be derived by adhering to the rule of an established
   order, for by this means he hoped to overcome or avoid the opposition
   of the Mendicants, who would certainly do their utmost to crush an
   entirely new society.

   Obedient to the directions given by their leader, Florentius, whom
   Groote had named as his successor, proceeded at once to build the House
   at Windesheim, a desolate place between Zwolle and Deventer.
   Afterwards, as the movement gained fresh adherents other houses were
   built, such as that near Arnheim, called "The Fount of the Blessed
   Mary," that near Hoern, named "The House of the New Light," and a
   third, called "The House of Mount St. Agnes," at Nemel.

   The Rule which was thus adopted had been summarized by Kettle well (p.
   173), and contains the following headings:

     I. To observe the fundamental law of Love, and to imitate the
     example of the Mother Church of Jerusalem in union of heart and in
     having all things in common.

     II. To learn the lesson of Humility, according to the pattern of the
     Life of Christ and that of His nearest and most faithful followers.

     III. To observe the Canonical Hours and times of prayer.

     IV. To take charge of the sick and infirm wherever they be found,
     and to minister to their bodily and spiritual needs.

     V. To avoid all affectation and singularity in dress.

     VI. To give and receive fraternal correction and admonition from one
     another, to confess our faults and to submit ourselves wholly to our
     Superior.

     VII. To promote in all things the interest of the Community; to be
     diligent in all duties and never to be idle.

     VIII. To observe outward cleanliness and decency, and to take proper
     care of the body for the sake of the soul, both in health and
     sickness.

   In connection with this last provision it is interesting to find that
   in consequence of the austerities practised by certain of the Brothers
   in the earlier days of the Community at Deventer their health failed,
   and therefore the custom was established at Windesheim of exacting from
   every member a promise "to endeavour to eat well, and sleep well."

   The habit adopted by the Brothers was of dark grey cloth, and when they
   became Canons Regular they wore a white rochet with a black hood.

   It will be noticed that the only title given to the head of the
   community in the following lives is that of Rector. The first "Prior"
   of the Order appears to have been John à Kempis (elected in 1398), the
   elder brother of Thomas, to whom reference is made in the life of
   Gronde.

   The members of the Brotherhood were divided into two classes, the
   Clerks and the Unlettered Brethren; and of these the former devoted
   themselves to the cause of education, and to copying books in addition
   to the duties above indicated, while the latter occupied themselves in
   manual labour.

   It is beside our purpose to trace in detail the growth and decline of
   this society, but it may not be out of place to indicate some of the
   causes of that decline.

   Some writers of repute have referred to à Kempis, Gerard Groote and
   others who belonged to this society as forerunners of the Reformation,
   and it is true enough to say that their teaching and that of certain
   leaders of the Protestant movement had points of contact. To say this,
   however, is to say very little, for the same statement might be made
   equally truly of the teaching of Luther and that of Bellarmine, whilst
   a very moderate degree of ingenuity would suffice to show that on many
   points Calvin was at one with St. Francis Xavier. Groote indeed
   protests against various abuses, but so also does Urban VI; and if
   Gerard of Zutphen advocates the dissemination of portions of the
   Scripture in the vulgar tongue, it was a Pope who praised the
   Archbishop of Florence for publishing the sacred writings in the
   language of his own country. It is hardly possible to read the lives
   which follow without admitting that both their subjects and their
   author were loyal to their Church and to its head: on this point the
   appendix to the life of Lubert Berner would appear to be conclusive,
   for the temptations there described would probably be regarded in a
   very different light by one whose leanings were toward Protestantism.

   It is perhaps more true to say that the movement called the New
   Devotion is one manifestation of a tendency which, according to the
   direction given to it, may become either a source of additional power,
   or a cause of disruption. This is not in any sense a controversial
   work, for which, indeed, the writer has no qualifications, and these
   lives, with the other writings of à Kempis, may be left to tell their
   own story; but since a late writer seems to represent the Reformation
   as the "fruit" of the labour of the Brothers of the Common Life
   (Kettlewell, p. 379), it is necessary to remark that the Founder of the
   Brotherhood uses the words, "Salvo Semper judicio Sacrosanctae Romanae
   ecclesiae cui humillime undique et ubique me submitto," and his
   followers never departed from the principle here laid down. Had that
   principle been adopted universally, the Reformation could never have
   taken the course it did take. There is a wide difference between
   protests that are directed against breaches of recognized law, and
   deliberate revolt against the fundamental principles upon which those
   laws are based. The former course was adopted by Groote and his
   followers, whilst Luther and his adherents chose the latter. Moreover,
   neither Gerard Groote nor any of his followers whose lives are written
   here, attacked any doctrine of the Catholic creed, nor did they claim
   that liberty of interpretation which many Reformers allowed. The
   decline of the Community coincided with the rise of Protestantism, but
   the causes of that decline are not far to seek. In the first place the
   Brothers had supported themselves to a great extent by copying books, a
   source of revenue which came to an end with the introduction of the
   printing press. Secondly, their schools had to face the competition of
   similar institutions which sprang up during the fifteenth and sixteenth
   centuries. In some cases their own pupils successfully competed with
   them, in others the Institutions founded by the Society of Jesus became
   popular at the expense of the schools maintained by the Brothers of the
   Common Life. Thirdly, "when the struggle about the Reformation became
   acute, the Papal Party insisted that those who clave" to the Church as
   a divine institution, must either withdraw from their monasteries or
   give in their adherence to them," and "This led to a great
   disbandonment of the Brotherhood" (Kettlewell, p. 379). From this it
   appears that even in the later days to which the passage quoted refers,
   the Brotherhood as a whole had not adopted the tenets of the reforming
   party, while in earlier times, as we have already seen, the members
   were thoroughly loyal to Rome; indeed, the association received the
   approbation of the Council of Constance, which would not have been
   given had their fidelity been suspected.

   The text which had been adopted for this translation is that of
   Somalius, which was published in 1600. The Editor tells us in his
   preface that he collated all the known manuscripts, and paid special
   attention to those which he found written in à Kempis's own hand, in
   the monastery of St. Martin at Louvain; he, however, omits, as he says,
   certain lives, because the manuscripts were in so bad a condition that
   he could make nothing of them. It appears uncertain whether these
   omitted lives were really by Thomas à Kempis. The earliest printed
   edition is that published at Nuremberg in 1492-1494, of which copies
   are to be found in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and in the British
   Museum, and this edition contains no lives other-than those given by
   Somalius. The book begins with the "Imitation," which occupies
   twenty-six leaves, and goes on with "Tractatus de meditatione Cordis
   Johannis Gerson," the inclusion of which work in a volume devoted to
   Thomas à Kempis, is remarkable in view of the controversy which has
   arisen with regard to the authorship of the "Imitation," It is beside
   our purpose to discuss this vexed question, as there is no doubt as to
   the authenticity of the "Lives" or of the propriety of their
   attribution to à Kempis, but it may be worth while to mention the fact
   that the present writer has seen a MS. of the first book of the
   "Imitatio," whose date would seem to be about 1423, in which that work
   is assigned to a Carthusian Monk.

   Besides the Nuremberg Folio there are other printed editions earlier
   than that of Somalius, which the latter seems to have consulted,
   namely, the works of à Kempis published in Paris by Jodocus Radius
   Ascensius in 1500, and re-issued in 1549. For purposes of correction
   this edition is of little value, since the same blunders and misprints
   occur frequently both in this and in Somalius' edition; but it is
   interesting as containing a Life of à Kempis in twelve chapters written
   by the Editor, of which the eighth gives some further particulars as to
   Gerard Groote, while the eleventh contains a long exhortation addressed
   to à Kempis by Florentius Radewin.

   "The Lives" are written in the form of a dialogue between an elder
   Brother of the house and a Novice, and were no doubt intended for the
   instruction of those who should join the Brotherhood. In the Nuremberg
   Folio the whole of Book II (the Life of Florentius) is entitled "de
   humilitate Christi," a title which is confined in Somalius's edition to
   the first chapter of this biography; this heading gives the key-note to
   the whole composition, for throughout the Lives the virtues upon which
   the author insists most strongly are those of humility and obedience.
   There are several points to be noted with reference to the matter
   contained in these biographies, (i) The use of quotations from the
   Bible is somewhat peculiar, or at least may strike the modern reader as
   being so; e.g., passages are taken away from their context and made to
   bear a meaning other than that which they were intended primarily to
   convey. This "mystical interpretation" was then regarded as legitimate,
   and, indeed, is still so regarded by many persons. The quotations are
   of course from the Vulgate, and the translations are taken usually from
   the Douay version.

   (2) With regard to the last chapter of Groote's Life, it is obvious
   from a perusal of the original that the whole is taken from notes made
   by Gerard himself, which notes were left in a fragmentary condition,
   and were not thrown into regular literary form, probably because they
   were intended for the writer's own guidance and not for publication.
   Thus we find constant changes from the first to the second person, and
   it is often doubtful where the consideration of one subject ends and
   that of another begins; this is particularly noticeable in 16.

   (3) Hirsche has remarked that "the details given in these eleven
   biographies are either derived from the personal experiences of à
   Kempis himself or are drawn from the testimony of reliable witnesses,"
   and the manner in which some of the incidents are related suggests that
   even when the author does not expressly mention his own name he was
   personally concerned in the events which he describes. Thus we gather a
   certain amount of information as to à Kempis himself, which is the more
   interesting in view of the scanty knowledge which has come down to us
   directly of the life of one whose name has become a household word.

   (4) Appended to these biographies is a life of the Virgin Lydewig, to
   whom reference is made in the notice of Arnold of Schoonhoven. This
   life is not included in the present translation, which is devoted to
   the Lives of Groote and his followers only. There is little doubt,
   however, that it is an authentic work of à Kempis, as a copy of it
   exists in his own handwriting, though the original MSS., containing the
   Lives of the eleven Brethren and the chronicles of Mount St. Agnes have
   disappeared. On the other hand, the life is prefaced by a dedication
   ascribing it to "Frater N pauper peregrinus," but this may easily refer
   to Thomas himself.

   I have already disclaimed any intention of entering into the
   controversy regarding the authorship of the "Imitatio," but as several
   passages in the latter work are closely parallel to sentences in the
   Lives it seems advisable to call attention to the fact. The reader will
   find particulars in "Hirsche," v. 2. p. 523.

   (6) The date of the composition of these lives cannot be determined
   with certainty. Hirsche states that 1430 is the last date that occurs,
   being the year of Arnold's death, but as I have already pointed out,
   the text which has been adopted gives 1439 as the last year of Henry
   Brune, and there is reason to think that this date is correct since
   Brune is said to have lived "long after those who had known their first
   fervour in the Devout Life with him." All we can say on the question of
   the date is that the Lives were written later than 1440 and that the
   author was upwards of sixty years of age when he wrote them.

   Hitherto no complete translation of the Lives into English has been
   published, although several writers have made extracts from them. The
   Rev. S. Kettlewell in his "Thomas à Kempis and the Brothers of the
   Common Life" has given us versions of selected passages, and as the
   present translation differs widely in many places from the versions
   given in the work named it may be desirable in the interests of
   accuracy to refer to some of the more prominent of those differences.
   In Groote, chap. viii, § 2, we have a passage which runs thus: "Cum
   tuba salutari intonaret . . . commota sunt corda plurimorum a facie
   formidinis Domini, et a ventura ira judicii extremi, et ignis extremi":
   according to Kettlewell this means that Groote "entirely abandoned the
   vulgar arguments drawn from the fears of Hell," an interpretation which
   is both impossible in view of the original text, and is a complete
   misrepresentation of Groote's teaching (Kettlewell, op. cit., 2nd ed.,
   p. 70). Again in chap. ix, § 2, we have "Tanto libentius doctrinam
   audiebant quanto majora pietatis beneficia in eo redundare videbant."
   Kettlewell takes this to mean that the more the scribes listened to
   Gerard's teaching "the more did they seem to abound in beneficent acts
   of piety," (Kettlewell, p. 72.) So, too, in Florentius, chap. xiv, § 3,
   "Incontinenti expedivit" is rendered by "he extricated the incontinent
   man" (Kettlewell, p. 106), whereas the passage means, as I think, "he
   settled the matter out of hand": and in chap. xix, § 3, "quod cuidam
   revelatum esset quod adhuc supervicturus esset" is translated "it was
   revealed respecting him to some one who is still living," a rendering
   which is grammatically impossible.

   Such slips as "a quarter of an hour" for "quartâ horâ," "liquor" for
   "cibus," "soul" for "mensa," and the like, are of small moment, but
   they show at least that to differ from a translator who committed such
   blunders does not argue a great amount of audacity. More serious,
   however, are such mistakes as that made in the "Life of John Ketel,"
   when Kettlewell makes à Kempis say that John was "so lately well known
   to me" instead of "in old days well known," etc. In regard to this it
   is only necessary to observe that Ketel had been dead for more than
   forty years when à Kempis wrote these words, and to use the phrase "so
   lately" is to confuse dates. It is not necessary to multiply instances
   of the mistakes, more or less important, made by this translator, but
   the reliability of his work may be judged by "quid praetendit ille
   bonus homo"--what a good man he has shown himself to be; "integros
   panes"--"the whole of the bread" though the context requires "whole
   loaves:" "ferens patienter verba increpantis"--"hearing the words with
   incredible patience." All these blunders occur in the translation of a
   single page of the Latin.

   Kettlewell's work, however, is not without its value, as apart from his
   extracts from the Lives, it contains much information that is of
   interest to students of à Kempis, and the present writer would not have
   singled out the above passages for adverse comment but for his desire
   to justify himself in differing from one who is regarded as a leading
   authority.

THE LIFE OF THE REVEREND MASTER

GERARD THE GREAT COMMONLY

CALLED GROOTE
     __________________________________________________________________

                          THE LIFE OF GERARD THE GREAT

PREFACE

   The Preface to the life of the venerable Master Gerard the Great,
   commonly called "Groote"

   (1)

   WITH the help of God, and daring much for the sake of Charity, I will
   try, my most beloved brother, to set forth the acts of the Fathers,
   though I recount but few out of many: and this I do by reason of thy
   frequent importunities, and for the common good.

   Now since many Fathers and devout brethren, who were of old well known
   to me, are fallen asleep, I fear not to speak of their virtues, that by
   so doing I may leave a good memorial of them to those that come after,
   when I speak of the excellent example which they set, to enhance yet
   more the honour of the name of God. I will begin therefore from that
   notable and devout preacher the venerable Master Gerard who is surnamed
   "Groote."

   (2) After this, if the Lord will, I will add further certain examples
   of holy conversation, drawn from the lives of those devout brethren who
   were his disciples, hoping thereby to stir up thy devotion, and that of
   other single-minded brethren.

   Though I did not see Gerard in the flesh, yet have I known in the body
   divers men who owned discipleship to him, and from these I have often
   heard of his good deeds; so that thou must not think that I have
   devised these things of mine own imagination, but rather that I have
   received a faithful relation thereof from trusty persons, both men and
   women.

CHAPTER I

   Of the origin and interpretation of Gerard's name

   (1)

   THE venerable Master Gerard, called the "Great," was a citizen of the
   city of Deventer, born of honourable parents of that same place, and
   tenderly nurtured by the loving care of his family; the name which he
   inherited from his earthly parents was apt enough, but by Divine
   providence it was afterwards changed for a better; for he who had
   exchanged his former manner of life for a new mode of living, justly
   deserved that his name too should have a godly signification by reason
   of his signal virtues, as the following narrative will show.

   (2) His name Gerard may be interpreted as meaning one "gerens artes,"
   that is, "cultivating the arts," because being given up to literary
   studies he was deeply learned in the liberal arts and in many sciences:
   or again the interpretation may be "gerens ardorem"--one who cultivates
   a burning zeal--because, being mercifully prevented by the grace of
   God, his inner man was inflamed by the love of Christ, and moved by an
   irresistible impulse to enhance the Glory of God: or thirdly one may
   say that he was rightly named Gerard as being one "gerens
   ardua"--cultivating that which is on high--because being wholly turned
   to God, he during his life did mighty and lofty deeds, lifting his mind
   earnestly to the contemplation of heavenly things, and by his preaching
   converted many peoples to the amending of their lives. His life, his
   words, his character, and his teaching were a light and a flame to all
   this land of ours: so in fact, as in name, he was "great" in the
   world--endowed with wealth, honour, learning, and high place: yet his
   greatness stood out more conspicuously from his contempt of
   worldliness, and his imitation of the lowly life of Jesus Christ, and
   also from the abundant harvest of followers whom he brought to Him, as
   the traces left behind him do clearly show.

   (3) This man therefore shall be held in perpetual memory, a man who in
   our own day was a teacher, following the regulations of the orthodox
   faith; and one who by his pious example restored the position of our
   Holy Religion. Although for a long time he mixed carelessly and
   thoughtlessly in the concerns of this world, yet, after his conversion,
   his life was truly exemplary, being spent in the deepest humility and
   devotion, in holy poverty and frequent fasting, a life too which he
   ended well and with a happy issue of his strife.

CHAPTER II

   Of his rapid progress at the University of Paris

   (1)

   WHEN he was growing toward manhood, Gerard was sent by his parents to
   the University of Paris, and being furnished with abundant means,
   beyond those of many of his companions, he busied himself with those
   pursuits for the sake of which he had come. At that time he was not
   seeking the glory of Christ as the end of his studies, but pursuing the
   shadow of a great reputation he was chiefly anxious for the praise of
   men.

   (2) In a short time, however, having passed through the usual course
   for students, he eagerly sought for higher place; and in virtue of his
   good understanding, a Master of Arts degree was conferred upon him in
   the eighteenth year of his age. Having gained this degree, and being
   fired by a natural genius and puffed up with worldly knowledge, he was
   rewarded with preferment in the Church, and received amongst other
   benefices a Canonry in the Church of Aix. But hitherto he walked in the
   broad ways of the world, not being yet inspired, until by the mercy of
   God he was changed into another man.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III

   How his conversion was revealed to a hermit in Cologne

   (1)

   BUT inasmuch as the Almighty and merciful God, who alone worketh great
   marvels, had decreed to loose this learned and most famous Master from
   the bonds of this present world, He brought the process of that
   conversion to full effect; and this conversion, unexpected and unknown
   to the generality of men, was beforehand revealed and foretold to a
   certain hermit in Cologne.

   (2) For when on a time Gerard was in that city and wandering idly was
   watching some worldly games, the aforesaid hermit, expressly mentioning
   the name and describing the dress of Gerard, foretold that his
   conversion should shortly be brought to pass, and should be of profit
   to many.

   Wherefore a certain man, who knew of this prophecy, came to Gerard
   where he was standing, and said, Why standest thou thus intent upon
   empty things? Thou oughtest to become another man."

   This saying about himself Gerard thought but childishness, nor did he
   at the time dwell much upon it; but God who hath foreknowledge of the
   future and doth not deceive, after a short time brought the word to
   pass as He had fore-ordained, and re-called to Himself Gerard whom He
   loved, from the paths of iniquity to the state of godly living, working
   by means of a Religious of the Carthusian order.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV

   How be was drawn to God by the Carthusian

   (1)

   THERE was in the district of Gelders, near the city of Arnheim, a
   certain Religious that was Prior of the Carthusian Monastery in
   Monichuysen, a man of learning and piety who had formerly, when in the
   world, been intimate with Gerard. This man being full of compassion and
   drawn towards his neighbour by his zeal for souls, began to consider in
   what way he could have speech with Gerard and treat in private with him
   for his salvation, so that a man so great, and a master so learned
   might not perish in the world, but might be snatched from out the
   snares of the Devil by the aid of God and be joined to the number of
   the elect.

   Now at that time particularly the disposition of the world seemed to be
   on all sides turned to evil, so that there were few who preached the
   Word of Life both by example and precept, and fewer still who followed
   the rule of continency; and this was above all things lamentable, that
   those who professed the name of Holy Religion and the state of the
   Devout Life through lack of inspiration followed but lamely in the
   footprints of the Fathers who had gone before. Amongst the Carthusians
   indeed the light of the Heavenly Life remained, though hidden; to
   carnal men their rule seemed to be austere enough, but yet it was most
   acceptable to God, and to men of fervent spirit a thing pleasant and
   worthy to be chosen.

   (2) Meantime it happened that for some reason which arose, the
   aforesaid Prior went to Utrecht, and when he knew that his beloved
   Gerard was there he hastened lovingly to hold converse with him; and
   soon, on a good opportunity, let down the net of holy exhortation to
   draw this great fish from the waves of worldliness.

   He approached Gerard as his familiar friend, greeted him as his old
   comrade and exhorted him with words of wisdom as his kindly host: he
   spoke to him as to a man of learning of "The Sovereign Good"; he laid
   before him the rewards of Eternity and the terrors of the judgement to
   come, with mingled kindliness and severity: he praised the Religious
   Life, and denounced the ways of the world, showing that everything
   beneath the sun shall perish. "Death," he said, "doth hang over every
   man, but the day and hour of death are unknown. But oh! how great are
   the gifts promised to those that follow Christ." The grace of God was
   present with them during this holy converse, which was oftentimes
   repeated; the heart of the hearer was softened, and the reverend Master
   believed the words spoken to him; he assented to the Prior's words as
   true, and was led by his reasoning; he was attracted by the promises,
   and confirmed by the examples of the Saints. At length he resolved to
   change his mode of life for a better, and by the favour of God to
   renounce the pomps of the world.

   (3) The Prior, perceiving this, was greatly delighted in that the seed
   from God had fallen upon good ground: and he rejoiced with exceeding
   joy over this great fish which was caught by the hook of Christ to be
   drawn thereby the sooner from the whirlpools of the Sea. He returned
   joyfully to his community and rendered thanks to God from Whom is every
   good thing, and confessed that he himself had not framed his discourse
   in vain. "For," quoth he, "I have hopes that I have captured Gerard,
   and in regard to his conversion I have faith that he will be ready to
   hold to his good resolution and to prove it by his deeds." Oh!
   overpowering and glorious mercy of our Saviour! Oh! unspeakable virtue
   and grace of the Holy Ghost, which with ease can change the heart of
   man when He taketh up His abode therein, and doth enlighten it. This is
   the transforming power of the right Hand of the most High Who doeth
   marvels in the heaven above, and showeth signs in the earth beneath:
   Who driveth away the darkness and poureth light into the heart. This is
   the mighty power of God alone, who with the blessings of His mercy hath
   prevented His beloved servant, Gerard, and hath changed him from a lion
   into a lamb. Before time was He ordained that Gerard should be one with
   Himself, and in the fullness of time He hath made him ready to preach
   the Word of good tidings to many cities and peoples, for the glory and
   honour of His Holy Name.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V

   Of his change of garb and character

   (1)

   NOT long afterwards, Gerard began to carry into effect that upon which
   of his own good will he had determined. So his mind being made sure,
   and confirmed in Christ, he resigned all his preferments, and changed
   his secular dress for a simple habit as befitted an humble clerk who
   prefers the contempt of the world before riches.

   A rumour went abroad amongst the people; and many wondering at the
   strangeness of the matter, spoke to one another saying "What can his
   reason be, and what change hath befallen him; hath much learning made
   him mad? Lo! he who formerly went in fair clothing, now is clad in
   rough and sad coloured wool. He who delighted in feasting and in varied
   meats, doth now reject pleasant food, and seeketh poor fare; he doth
   flee from high place, and loveth poverty." But yet the hand of God was
   with him, and he began to labour faithfully in the name of the Lord.

   (2) Holding the common talk and vain chatter of men in small esteem,
   Gerard turned himself to God with the strength of his whole heart, for
   he said, "I have chosen to be an abject in the house of my God rather
   than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners"; and so, God working with
   him, he exchanged riches for poverty, pride for humility, luxury for
   self-denial, unstableness for a stedfast mind, worldliness for a
   spiritual life, subtlety for devotion and singlemindedness. While the
   people were talking and wondering at the sudden change in so great a
   man, one of his fellow citizens who was of high position came to him
   secretly, wishing to know more fully the purpose of the reverend master
   in fleeing from the joyous companionship of the world.

   (3) And when he had inquired anxiously of him about many things, and
   had heard fully the explanation of the mystery of Gerard's
   renunciation, he was so instructed in the matters of which he had
   doubted, that he went away greatly edified and said: "Why do these
   ignorant and vulgar folk speak words so senseless of this good and
   prudent man? Never was he so wise and full of knowledge as when of late
   he fled from the world and left its ways, and in an humble spirit
   resolved to be the servant of God. How happy would that man be who
   should be willing to imitate rather than to insult one who hath done so
   well. If he shall continue in this good course, he shall be the means
   of much good."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI

   How he separated himself from fellowship with worldlings

   (1)

   LEST the holy seed planted in Gerard's heart by God should be trodden
   under foot of them that passed by, or lying uncovered should be
   devoured by the fowls of the air; lest the light that was kindled in
   him should be extinguished by an empty wind, in place of being kept
   beneath a bushel and nourished by the oil of inward devotion; and lest
   the tender and fragile reed, being blown about by the breeze of vanity,
   should be soon bent earthward and not strengthened with power from on
   High, the humble Gerard resolved to go apart for a time, to separate
   himself carefully from worldly sights and converse, to release his mind
   from all the cares of the world, and to be at leisure for the things of
   God only, and for his own soul. By this means he would first learn in
   his own person that of which he must afterward become a teacher, and
   having tasted the sweetness of the things of God, he would more calmly
   bear adversity for the truth's sake, and not fear the assaults of the
   Devil which might be brought against him.

   (2) He departed therefore from his city, and from his father's house,
   and came to the country of Gelders to the Carthusian Brothers in
   Monichuysen whom he loved in the love of Christ. By these he was
   received with reverence and was given a cell as being a guest worthy to
   be loved: and entering into it joyfully and eagerly he said in the
   exultation of his soul with Blessed Peter, "Lord, it is good for us to
   be here,"

   There he called back his heart from its former wanderings, there he
   wiped away the mildew. of his old life and restored the image of his
   inner man to purity--there he broke the rising storms of passion by
   watching and by fast, and overcame the various assaults of Devils by
   prayer and tears, saying with Holy David, "Lo I have gone far off
   flying away; and I abode in the wilderness. I waited for him that hath
   saved me from pusillanimity of spirit and a storm." I too have seen the
   place of his habitation, in which this light of God, this friend of the
   Almighty, was hidden for a season, until he should be placed upon a
   candlestick, that he might show an example of light to all.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII

   Of his abstinence, and the shirt of hair which be wore

   (1)

   THIS new soldier of Christ therefore, fearlessly took his post in the
   Carthusian Camp: and within he was not overcome by the weariness of his
   cell, nor abroad was he broken down by the burden of his toil, but as a
   true son of the Cloister he kept watch over both heart and lips.
   Moreover he carefully tilled the field of his own heart, making a daily
   and rigorous inspection of the same, rooting out the thorns of vice and
   sowing the seeds of virtue.

   So Gerard waging spiritual warfare against flesh and blood, was by his
   retreat strongly armed against himself that he might the more quickly
   overthrow the Devil, the Ruler of this world and the Prince of
   Darkness.

   He did not pamper himself, as loving, luxury, nor spare himself as
   being weak, nor make excuses for himself as being innocent, nor put off
   the time of repentance like a careless and lukewarm servant; but
   mindful of his former evil living, he took unto him the spirit of
   contrition, and for the name of Jesus, crucified his own flesh with its
   affections and lusts, desiring to win favour in the sight of Christ.
   Though his body was frail, he laid upon it frequent fasts; he abstained
   from flesh (as is the custom of the Carthusian order), and also from
   many foods which that Custom allows; he prolonged the watches of the
   night, and drove away the heaviness of sleep from his eyes by standing,
   by prayer and by genuflexion; and in the spirit of devotion he
   compelled the body to be a slave to the soul.

   (2) He girt his loins with a cloth of hair which was very rough and
   full of knots that the wantonness of the flesh might not allure him:
   and he faithfully mortified the body for the soul's sake, constraining
   his reins with the firm strength of purity. Thus he truly, and to the
   very letter fulfilled the words of the prophet in the Psalm, and could
   justly say, "But as for me, when they were troublesome to me I was
   clothed with hair-cloth."

   "O good Master who were they that were thine enemies in the Cloister?"

   "Verily the desires of the flesh, the allurements of the world, and the
   temptations of the Devil."

   "Wondrous is it that in this retreat where thou dwellest far from
   worldly things thou shouldest have temptations!"

   "I am not safe, neither I nor any man who is born in sinful flesh; but
   that I may not be overcome of depraved affections or moved by evil
   example I have sought a place of solitude in the greater hope of divine
   protection. Even Christ Himself was never so openly tempted as when He
   entered into the desert and fasted from food, and yet He was not
   disturbed by any human passion. I, therefore, who am a sinner, that I
   may give the more satisfaction to my God, have withdrawn myself from
   men and humbled my soul with fasting that my prayer might be turned
   into mine own bosom."

   A certain devout sister, whom Gerard had converted, told me certain
   things: how that after his death she saw his hair shirt, and touched it
   with her hands; it was very long and rough and had many knots in it for
   the infliction of greater punishment upon him.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII

   How, by the advice of the Monks, he began to preach the word of God

   (1)

   BUT as the devout and learned Master continued in the increase of
   virtue, and in proportion as Christ grew more sweet to him so much the
   more did the world become of no account in his sight: and when by the
   ordinance of God the time of his fruit-bearing was at hand, it was
   determined by these wise and religious brethren that this burning and
   shining light should be placed upon a candlestick to give light to them
   that are of the household of God, in order that by the voice of his
   preaching, and by the example of his holy conversation he might kindle
   the hearts of sinners.

   It would have been good that a man of such mighty power should be
   continually at leisure for the things of God and his own soul in the
   solitude of the Cloister, but they hoped to gain yet greater good and
   higher glory for God by sending him forth; because a learned man like
   Gerard who was apt for preaching but less apt for bearing the burden of
   a Religious order--one moreover who had learned to tread the path of
   humility by despising all earthly things--would be of profit to more
   souls by openly preaching the Word of life. By so doing he would bring
   the greatest gain to Christ and lead many with him to the eternal
   kingdom; and the more fervently he laboured for the salvation of souls
   in this present world, so much the more glorious would he be in the
   world to come.

   (2) For three years he devoted himself to study and prayer before he
   began to preach; thus this faithful herald was furnished with spiritual
   armour, and with the writings of the Scriptures, that he might announce
   the good tidings of the Word of God in the cities and villages; he had
   many hearers both clerks and lay folk as well as the Religious Orders:
   men and women; small and great; learned and unlearned; men of high
   degree and councillors; rulers, slaves and free; rich and poor; men of
   the land and strangers. When he sounded upon the trumpet of salvation
   withholding from the ears of his hearers no note that was necessary
   thereunto, but openly proclaiming the full purpose of God for all men
   according to their state, condition, sex and age, the hearts of many
   were moved to flee from before the face of the anger of God, the coming
   wrath of the last judgement and the final fires of Hell. He "placed the
   axe to the root of the tree," according to the saying of the blessed
   John the Baptist--"Let all men therefore" (said he) "fear the strict
   judge, abandon sin, and bring forth fruits meet for repentance--let
   them be forward to do the will of their Holy Creator and appease Him,
   by being instant in prayer, almsgiving, and fasts."

   Many who heard his discourse were pricked to the heart, and coming to
   him yielded themselves to his direction, putting away all the vanity of
   the world. Some also in their zeal for chastity remained virgin, and
   some who had taken the vow of continency gathered together others with
   them for the service of God.

   (3) But since the righteousness of the good suffereth the envy of evil
   men, some persons of corrupt mind, lovers of the world and followers of
   luxurious living, often spoke against Gerard, for they hated the way of
   truth, and were enemies of every good thing.

   These persons secretly defamed the man of God, and sometimes by open
   railing strove to stir up a tumult against him, and that because he
   argued with severity against their own vices and crimes: but a yet more
   wicked thing was done, in that certain priests and prelates and
   wandering friars thought it unworthy to bear with the teaching of so
   great a man and with his eagerness for justice to be done upon those
   that deserted the holy law. They strove therefore to blacken his fame,
   and to fight down his constancy of purpose, of whom he himself writes
   in one of his letters. "Many snarling folk are come about me, who rage
   even as the fire among the thorns, but they do not appear openly."
   Wherefore this lover of Christ, this zealot for souls, was neither
   shaken by the threats of his enemies, nor vexed by the dispraise of
   them that upbraided him; for he was founded upon a strong rock because
   he sought not the glory of the world, nor feared to suffer shame for
   Christ. He was ready indeed for the truth's sake, and for the Gospel of
   God, to yield up both body and soul so as to promote, and wheresoever
   it might be, to extend His glory. And so blessed be God who raised up
   for us such a preacher and sent him forth to preach; for it was through
   him that there shone upon us who are in this lower, world, the Light of
   the Heavenly Life.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX

   Of his labours, and his patience toward his enemies

   (1)

   IT were a long task to tell of the labours which he underwent in
   preaching, the conflicts of disputation which he maintained against
   subverters of the faith, and the exhortations which he delivered to
   strengthen in their holy purposes the brethren and sisters who had
   given themselves to the devout life. These things are most clearly
   shown in the letters which he wrote to divers persons for their
   consolation. Thus he says in one letter written to the priests in
   Amsterdam, who were very well known to him. "Be not afraid, my most
   beloved, if ye have heard my evil report from the men of Kempen. All
   things are turning out as I hope in accordance with the will of God.
   Let Charity burn within us with no sluggish flame but fiercely. Let us
   despise these filthy communications and be ensamples of the Most High,
   to the Glory of our Creator."

   When he perceived that many prelates of the Church were opposed to him,
   and that his preaching was being hindered by the envy of his enemies,
   and that he was forbidden to preach by an edict craftily obtained, he
   yielded in a spirit of humility to this rage and envy, being unwilling
   to stir up a tumult amongst the people against the clergy. Moreover, he
   said to the^common folk who took ill this inhibition as having been
   obtained by falsehood: "They are our prelates, and as is fitting and
   due we wish to obey their edicts; for we seek not to hurt any, nor to
   stir up a scandal. The Lord well knoweth His own whom He hath chosen
   from the beginning, and He will also call them by His grace, without
   our aid, in what manner soever He will." He therefore held his peace
   for a time, and meanwhile gave himself to private exhortation, counting
   out the riches of the Word of Consolation with an eager heart to all
   who came to him,--as also the blessed Paul saith:--"and I myself will
   be spent for your souls, seeking not what is profitable to myself but
   to many."

   (2) He also caused several books of sacred theology to be written out
   by the pupils whom he attracted to him by his excellent discourses: he
   paid them wages, inviting them to come to his own house and hear the
   Word of God more often, that so he might dispose them to chastity, and
   to the amending of their lives, by which means they might become
   partakers of everlasting blessedness, being fashioned to a new and holy
   life, if they should renounce worldly courses. Meanwhile with Godly
   prudence he did not pay all their wages at one time, but divided the
   money into several portions, in order that they might often come, and
   with such opportunities for intercourse with him might find grace; and
   these men came the more gladly as they saw beneficent acts of holiness
   abounding in him--for Gerard earnestly strove to win some of these
   writers to Christ, a purpose which by the favour of God was shortly
   brought to pass. He loved to speak with such simpleminded and less
   learned men rather than with the wise of the world, because the
   innocent and the needy for the most part give place to the purposes of
   God more readily than the worldly-wise who trust in their own wisdom.
   For which things' sake the prophet David said, "The innocent and the
   upright have adhered to me because I have waited on Thee."

   (3) A certain man of the order of mendicants, a Religious in garb, but
   a worker of mischief in speech, began to speak against the venerable
   Master in many things, and when he could not overcome him, he hastened
   to the Curia at Rome to bring a suit against this man of God, or by
   some other crafty device to impose silence upon him: which thing he
   would have feared to do if he had been moved by the Spirit of God: but
   the Just Judge, the Lover of peace, ordered things otherwise than as
   this turbulent person had expected, for being suddenly smitten by
   sickness while upon his journey, he died; and his whole device fell to
   the ground and came to naught.

   There was another man of the order of preachers who was eloquent in
   discourse and had the fame and dignity of one in great esteem. This man
   having heard of the bright reputation of the venerable Master, rejoiced
   with exceeding charity thereupon, and congratulated Gerard with
   sincerity of mind. He sent him a friendly letter composed in elegant
   language, speaking highly of the good work which Gerard had begun, and
   urging him not to be broken down by the assaults of froward men, but to
   trust in God and stand firm, and to refresh Christian people with yet
   more copious draughts of the water that floweth from Heaven. Having
   heard this and having read the letter, the Master, who was tried in
   many things, embraced the writer, his fellow-worker in holy
   exhortation, with the arms of charity, and was strengthened by his
   letter, as by an oracle of God, for the work of preaching.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X

   Of his journey to the parts about Brabant

   (1)

   THE pious and humble Master Gerard, hearing of the great and widespread
   fame of John Ruysbroek, a monk and Prior of the Monastery of Grünthal,
   near Brussels, went to the parts about Brabant, although the journey
   was long, in order to see in bodily presence this holy and most devout
   father; for he longed to see face to face, and with his own eyes, one
   whom he had known hitherto only by common report and by his books; and
   to hear with his own ears that voice utter its words from a living
   human mouth--a voice as gracious as if it were the very mouthpiece of
   the Holy Ghost, He took with him therefore that revered man Master John
   Cele, the director of the School of Zwolle, a devout and faithful lover
   of Jesus Christ; for their mind and heart were at one in the Lord, and
   the fellowship of each was pleasant to the other, and this resolve was
   kindled within them that their journey, which was undertaken for the
   sake of spiritual edification, should redound in the case of each to
   the Glory of God.

   (2) There went also with them a faithful and devout layman, named
   Gerard the shoemaker, as their guide upon the narrow way, and their
   inseparable companion in this happy undertaking.

   When they came to the place called Grünthal, they saw no lofty or
   elaborate buildings therein, but rather all the signs of simplicity of
   life and poverty, such as marked the first footsteps of our Heavenly
   King when He, the Lord of Heaven, came upon this earth as a Virgin's
   Son, and in exceeding poverty. As they entered the gate of the
   monastery, that holy father, the devout Prior, met them, being a man of
   great age, of kindly serenity, and one to be revered for his honourable
   character. He it was whom they had come to see, and saluting them with
   the greatest benignity as they advanced, and being taught by a
   revelation from God, he called upon Gerard by his very name and knew
   him, though he had never seen him before. After this salutation he took
   them with him into the inner parts of the cloister, as his most
   honoured guests, and with a cheerful countenance, and a heart yet more
   joyful showed them all due courtesy and kindness as if he were
   entertaining Jesus Christ Himself.

   (3) Gerard abode there for a few days conferring with this man of God
   about the Holy Scriptures; and from him he heard many heavenly secrets
   which, as he confessed, were past his understanding, so that in
   amazement he said, with the Queen of Sheba, "O excellent father, thy
   wisdom and thy knowledge exceedeth the fame which I heard in mine own
   land; for by thy virtues thou hast surpassed thy fame." After this he
   returned with his companions to his own city greatly edified; and being
   as it were a purified creature, he pondered over what he had heard in
   his mind, and often dwelt thereon in his heart: also he committed some
   of Ruysbroek's sayings to writing, that they might not be forgotten.

   God also revealed to Gerard the death of this most beloved father,
   which revelation he made manifest in the hearing of many of the
   citizens by the tolling of the bells: and more privately, showed to
   certain of his friends that the soul of the Prior, after but one hour
   of Purgatory had passed to the glory of heaven.

   Gerard himself did not long survive, for when the third year after
   these things was almost past, there came the time appointed for him to
   die, and at the call of God he paid the debt of the flesh.

   This sojourn on his visit to the Prior was not a time of idleness, nor
   was the discourse of so holy a father barren; but the instruction of
   his living voice gave nurture to a fuller love, and an increase of
   fresh zeal, as he testifies in a letter which he sent to these same
   brethren in the Grünthal, saying "I earnestly desire to be commended to
   your director and Prior, the footstool of whose feet I would fain be
   both in this life, and in the life to come; for my heart is welded to
   him beyond all other men by love and reverence. I do still burn and
   sigh for your presence, to be renewed and inspired by your spirit and
   to be a partaker thereof."

CHAPTER XI

   Of his austerity in food and clothing

   (1)

   I WILL describe in a few words the manner of his private life, for he
   laid down for himself a rule, and has described in his writings many
   exercises of devotion.

   He was very temperate in the matter of food, and it was his custom to
   be satisfied almost always with but one meal in the day. He so
   regulated his need of sleep, that he thought that seven hours of rest
   were enough. He would not eat, save in his own house, by whomsoever he
   might be invited, for he avoided intercourse with worldly men and also
   those lengthy banquets in which rich men indulge themselves to the loss
   of the poor. So strictly did he abide by his rule, that none dared to
   invite him or to trouble him with importunities: and this rule being
   well known was so pleasing to the good as to take away any handle of
   malicious accusation from the wicked.

   Nevertheless he invited to his frugal table certain poor servants of
   God, and sometimes one or two of the honourable burghers, so as to
   instruct them in a better life: and these he regaled rather with the
   sweets of heavenly discourse than with carefully prepared courses of
   meats, for such he by no means provided. But whether he were alone, or
   were entertaining a guest, the reading of some holy book preceded the
   meal, and edifying discourse flowed from his honeyed tongue; but on
   other matters he strictly held his peace.

   (2) Laughter and jesting were far removed from his mouth, and still
   farther the blemishes of slanderous talk and worldly gossip which
   pertained not to the matter in hand. His conversation was seasoned with
   salt, and thoughts of devotion to God, and the health of the soul gave
   to his food a savour beyond that of any pleasant meat. He ever
   remembered as he sat at meat the heavenly table in the kingdom of God,
   and the sweet fellowship of the Saints which should follow our long
   exile in this present world. Thus he sent away his guests joyful in the
   Lord, and having their hearts pricked. He had a refectory of modest
   size, in which a few guests could sit with him, where near at hand and
   over against the table there stood a case filled with most excellent
   books to serve as it were for a wine-cellar, so that if the fare for
   the body were not pleasing, he might from this abundant supply put
   before his friends a draught of wine for the soul. He often ate food
   that was unseasoned or burned, and that not with impatience, but with
   giving of thanks, and as discharging the debt and paying the penalty
   for his former sumptuous living.

   (3) He used to prepare his food with his own hands, though he had no
   skill in cookery, and he refused to accept the services of the sisters
   who dwelt apart in a neighbouring building: if anything needed to be
   bought in the market, these looked to it for him; but he allowed no one
   of them to enter into his dwelling, but was content with the
   ministration of a single clerk. Both within his house and abroad he
   arranged everything with a view to honesty and good report, and lest
   aught that might cause suspicion should be observed, he would not speak
   to any one of the nuns, save behind a closed and curtained window.
   Things that were given him, or brought for his use, were pushed in by
   means of a wheeled vehicle--wherefore one of his pupils, seeing him so
   closely guarded, inquired privately of him concerning the matter, and
   said:

   "Why, good master, dost thou so carefully veil thy window?" and Gerard
   answered, "If I could, I would protect mine ears also that I might not
   hear the voices of women, for indeed excess of caution can do us no
   hurt; every cause of stumbling and danger to the weak cometh by lack of
   guard over the bodily sense, and from too much freedom of intercourse.
   He, therefore, that would preserve his integrity, let him keep his eyes
   and his ears in subjection, for only upon urgent necessity should one
   be so indiscreet as to speak with a woman."

   (4) He observed with the greatest strictness the fasts of Holy Church.
   On Fridays he abstained altogether from foods made with milk, and often
   on that day used salt as a condiment instead of oil. He seldom washed
   his plate, but wiped it with bread, or left it for a dog or for mice to
   lick, and he did not despise mouldy bread. On the fifth day of the week
   by reason of the coming Friday he washed all his vessels in water, to
   remove from them every trace of fat by way of penance. Therefore he was
   pleasing in the sight of God, by being content with the simple and bare
   necessaries of life, by cutting off what is superfluous and not
   requiring luxuries. Towards himself he was austere and churlish,
   towards others kindly and pitiful.

   (5) His garb was gray in colour and made in humble fashion, being
   neither soft nor gay, nor arranged in elaborate folds, and he seldom
   had new garments, for when his clothes were worn by age he had them
   patched and mended, nor was he ashamed, although a man of good birth,
   to be seen amongst his friends and fellow- citizens in vile raiment. He
   wore a tattered cloak mended with many patches, like to those worn by
   the poor and by beggars: a garment like to be despised by the rich, but
   a pattern to the devout, and worthy to be held in pious memory by them
   that come after. None of his raiment indeed was of great price, yet his
   merit in wearing the same was by no means small. All his adorning was
   the inner adorning of the heart, wherefore he looked not to the aspect
   of his outer man: and now he rejoiced to be clad in garments which once
   he would have thought scarce worth a glance. Oh! noble man, who wast
   not clad in soft raiment, but like John wast girt with a rough shirt of
   hair, and, like Christ, robed in the cloak of holy poverty.

   (6) He was asked once by a familiar friend why he wore so old and
   patched a garment, which any labouring man might blush to wear, and he
   replied in his own gracious and pleasant manner: "In this I look to
   mine own convenience; the patches are there to prevent me from
   suffering cold, and that the wind may not blow through the rents, as it
   would if they were not closed up." The brother hearing this was greatly
   edified, perceiving that Gerard sought not to please the world, but
   rather God only. He was also asked about his cloak and doublet, how old
   they were, to which he replied: "This thicker garment which I wear
   outside, is more than nine years old, but this thinner one, which I
   wear beneath it, I have had for two years only." "And how long," said
   his questioner, "hast thou worn thy doublet?" To which Gerard replied,
   "One of them is twelve years old, the other only three." Thus he could
   say with holy David in his faithful prayers to God, "See my abjection
   and my labour, and forgive me all my sins."

   (7) The humble Master following after poverty, remembered what manner
   of man he had been while in the world when he had loved luxury;
   wherefore it behoved him in justice to make amends for his former
   courses by the opposite manner of living; of old he used to go forth
   clad in fair attire and with a silvern girdle: and while among the
   canons, he had worn a sumptuous surplice and a fair almuce: likewise he
   had indulged his body with delicate food and with costly wines; but
   afterward being changed into another man, he did not suffer his former
   indulgences to go unpunished. He prostrated himself beneath the feet
   not only of his elders and men in high esteem, but also beneath those
   of the youngest lay folk, sometimes eating in their presence upon the
   bare earth, for he said, "I am not worthy to sit at meat with you, for
   I am a sinner beyond all men and have offended God." He who had been
   wont to anoint his head, and delicately to tire his hair, would
   afterward in his own despite wear an old moth-eaten biretta which was
   pierced with near to an hundred holes. Thus he did great violence upon
   himself, subdued the flesh, despised the world and bruised the head of
   the old Serpent, not permitting his passions to rule over him. He ever
   walked upon the path of humility under the leadership of Christ, and
   conformed his life by rule to the pattern of the Saints of old.

CHAPTER XII

   Of his devoutness in prayer and in hearing Holy things

   (1)

   WHO can tell how devout and fervent he showed himself in prayer? Often
   while reciting the "Hours" he broke forth with the voice of joy through
   the superabundance of grace which was shed upon him, and in sweet
   sounding hymns poured forth his inward rejoicing; and as he sang softly
   within his heart, his spirit, as a flame, was borne upward to God. He
   had more delight in holy discourse and devout prayer than he had had of
   old in worldly revellings or in the varied strains of singing men. He
   had one John of Zutphen to minister to him, who was surnamed
   Brinckerinc, a devout clerk of stablished character and one dedicated
   to God from his youth: he was wont to recite the "Hours" with Gerard,
   and to accompany him hither and thither when he preached, and Gerard
   loved him with the love of a father for his son, for indeed he was a
   youth of an excellent spirit, well beloved of God and man, and scarcely
   could be torn from his master's side. (2) Upon a time when they had
   made an end of reading the "Hours," Gerard said to him: "Of what
   thinkest thou? Understandest thou what thou readest? Tell me what is in
   thy mind." But he replied to his master: "How should I understand
   except some man should guide me." Then said Gerard to his disciple: "To
   me there come divers and mystic interpretations, and they lead my mind
   secretly from one meaning to another so that I could feel no weariness
   in reading, but should rejoice to dwell some while longer upon these
   good words." When he was upon a journey and had been received into a
   guest chamber, after saying Compline he spoke to his two companions,
   Florentius and the aforesaid John: "Let us say each one of us our daily
   suffrages"; and this too was a pious custom with them, that each one
   should tell the other of his own failings if he had seen anything
   worthy of blame in himself: they freely admonished one another in turn,
   gladly submitting themselves to censure, and acknowledging their sins
   with humility asked pardon therefor; and being thus corrected in
   brotherly love, they went to rest.

   (3) Once when the people of Deventer were going out armed against their
   enemies, this man of God prayed earnestly for the safety of his fellow
   citizens, and it happened by a dispensation of God that as the foe drew
   near, a thick cloud rose between the armies by which the opposing host
   was terrified and took to flight, but the men of Deventer returned to
   their city with speed and in safety--for the effectual fervent prayer
   of a righteous man availeth much.

   Every morning before he began to be about his worldly business, or to
   reply to those who questioned him, he would rekindle his mind by
   reading the Scriptures, for he ever studied to preface all that he
   should do with devout meditations and prayers according to that saying
   of the Psalmist: "My eyes to Thee have prevented the morning that I
   might meditate on thy words."

   (4) It was his rule to hear Mass daily with deep reverence and due
   devotion, seeking first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and
   afterward devoting himself to the service of his neighbour, thus in
   this twofold duty he held to the right path, as it is said in the book
   of Canticles: "He set in order charity in me." When he entered a Church
   he did not stand up to gaze upon the painted windows in the walls
   overhead, but bent the knee with humility before God, and prostrated
   himself in prayer; and he would hold no converse there, but delighted
   only to hear the praises of God, or to read the "Hours," for he avoided
   every idle word in the Temple of the Almighty. Lest his devotion might
   be disturbed by the concourse of men, or his secret converse with God
   be observed of bystanders, he secured a secluded and private place
   among the Friars-minor, and there alone and in secret he lay prostrate
   in prayer, gazing upon and adoring the Holy Sacrament of the Altar: for
   there was a small window through which the several altars could be
   seen. Here with prayers and groaning he knocked at the gate of Heaven,
   beating upon his breast most grievously, like the Publican, beseeching
   God to be propitious to him, and to pardon his past sins; to cleanse
   him from evil and the passions which threatened him; and to protect him
   from further perils by the bestowal of His Fatherly care, as in times
   past.

   (5) He was so eminent for devotion and meditation as to earn the
   comfort of a revelation from God, and the instruction of a spirit of
   prophecy as to future events. Thus he consoled one of his pupils, who
   was sad by reason of the long continued absence of a brother, with the
   tidings that he should soon come to him, "for thy brother is well,"
   said Gerard, "and will come shortly"; and so it came to pass. He also
   foretold of certain brothers who clung to him, that some of them should
   be promoted to the priesthood and some should take upon them the
   profession of the Religious Life. Once, being inflamed by a mighty
   longing for Eternal Life, he said to one of his pupils: "What further
   can I do here? would that I were with my Lord in Heaven"; and the
   brother answered him, saying: "Beloved Master, we cannot yet do without
   thy presence; who would instruct us as thou dost, and strive so
   earnestly on our behalf? We are few and feeble, and these worldlings
   perchance might soon put us to rout"; but Gerard again confidently
   affirmed: "I will ask the Father for you, that your devotion fail not,
   for it is a tree that the Lord hath planted upon this earth; I hope
   that this small beginning shall come to a great issue. God of His
   goodness shall provide for Himself another fitting man instead of me,
   who without doubt shall take his place as a buttress to the House of
   the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII

   Of his great love of reading the Holy Scriptures

   (1)

   THIS reverend doctor was possessed by a great love of reading the Holy
   Scriptures, and by an untiring zeal in collecting the books of learned
   men rather than treasures of money, whereof he bears witness in a
   letter, saying: "I am ever covetous, yea, more than covetous, of books,
   and if I lack them I am useless"; for although he was more learned than
   many doctors, he did not desire honour on that account, but he was the
   comforter of them that sorrowed, and ever the faithful helper of all
   who wished to serve God. He was instant in searching again and again
   the passages that he had read, and to dark sayings he gave yet more
   careful study so as to become continually better and more apt to take
   hold upon holy things. He was not ashamed to learn from younger men,
   nor to ask them questions, for he knew that which is written: "The
   declaration of Thy words giveth light, and giveth understanding to
   little ones"; wherefore he showed himself right easy of access and
   kindly to such men, and indeed chose rather to seek counsel from
   another, than to work out by himself many interpretations; for he said:
   "If a boy can teach me a fuller knowledge of the will of God, how much
   more gladly would I listen to him, rather than strive after some new
   doctrine by myself and without counsel from any man."

   (2) He was therefore earnest in reading the Scriptures, but was not
   careful to possess books beautifully adorned; the Breviary from which
   he read his "Hours" was of no great value since he avoided using
   anything that was outwardly splendid or that savoured not of
   simplicity: so when he saw one who had a book sumptuously ornamented,
   and noted how carefully the owner looked to it and turned the leaves,
   he said to him: "I had rather that a book were my servant, than be
   servant to a book; books should serve the interests of their reader's
   mind, not the nice taste of him who doth look at them"; for this reason
   the devout master gave more attention to the matter of a book than to
   the outward beauty of an embellished copy; so, too, the Blessed Jerome
   preferred to have a well corrected text, though the form of the book
   might be of small value, rather than a beautifully ornamented but
   incorrect copy. Yet it is a decent custom and to be commended as
   tending to the honour of God, and to the adornment of His Church which
   flourisheth over all the world, that the books of Holy Scripture, and
   those that are used in Divine Service should be somewhat sumptuously
   written, and be preserved from all taint of dust and defilement. So may
   they minister to many that are faithful in the peace of the Catholic
   Faith both of this and coming generations; and may stir the dull of
   heart to read more earnestly; and the books shall abide long with us
   because they are known to have been bought at a great price, and to
   have been written with great labour.

   (3) He was not only assiduous in reading the sacred books, but also
   wrote carefully, and published at the earnest desire of others, certain
   short works based upon the genuine sayings of the Saints for the use of
   them who sought his guidance, that he might teach those whom he could
   not reach in person and instruct by word of mouth. Amongst other works
   he wrote several notable letters, a collection of which is preserved
   and read for a worthy memorial of him. He had knowledge of all the
   liberal arts conjoined to a close acquaintance with Holy Scripture; a
   natural genius which was very keen and adorned by the light of the
   grace of God: a skilful tongue, fluent eloquence in exhortation, and a
   tenacious memory; so that there was scarcely known his equal in so many
   branches of knowledge or one so earnest and devout in holy
   conversation. Yet illustrious as he was for his special knowledge in
   matters of learning both human and divine, he was none the less humble
   and submissive in rendering honour to his superiors and to rulers of
   the Church. He was well disposed to study the simple and devout words
   of others: in speech he was circumspect; in writing, ready; in
   self-examination, scrupulous; in business committed to him, prompt and
   faithful. Lest he should forget what he ought to do or say when
   occasion came, he used to write at once upon the blank leaves or
   margins of his books and pamphlets clear notes upon the business in
   hand. Thus he kept carefully in readiness full records of all that he
   said for the overthrowing of the envious who were ever laying snares
   for him in many ways; and this he did that he might have at hand matter
   wherewith to answer the snarls of his detractors, should any necessity
   arise.

   (4) A certain prelate of the Church, an enemy to Gerard, disputed with
   him, and argued against some of his writings as if the master were less
   wise than he: for he himself did not perceive by what a plague of
   jealousy he was troubled. Then the man of God, knowing his own
   innocence, brought forward a great number of his letters, asserting
   that those things which were objected against him were not written by
   him, nor did they agree with what he had written. "Consider, Sirs,"
   said he, "what sort of letters ye have received or sent: lo! here is
   the full number and collection of letters which I have written with
   mine own hand--as these speak, so speak I--these I maintain and for
   these I answer"; and by the ready production of these letters the mouth
   of him that spoke evil of Gerard was stopped; and the famous master by
   his assertion of the Truth, was promoted to even greater honour in the
   minds of many who stood by. For the truth shall always prevail, though
   it is often spoken against by the ignorant.

   (5) It is said that Gerard had been skilled in astrology and
   necromancy, and before his conversion had been in the habit of
   displaying some few of the tricks of the art of magic: but I have
   learned from two of his pupils that more than these cannot be charged
   to him, for when one of these pupils asked him the truth of the matter,
   he said: "I did indeed learn the theory of that art, and I read and
   possessed books upon it, but I had no dealings with the follies of
   magical practice." Moreover a faithful pupil of Gerard, who was also a
   devout priest, added for my further information on this questionable
   matter the following explanation. "There are," he said, "two kinds of
   necromancy, of which one is called natural.' This kind is a most
   recondite study, and its difference from the second kind (which is
   called diabolic' and is forbidden by law), is perceived by but few
   persons. Gerard was learned in the natural kind, but I believe that he
   had not studied the other, nor had made any compact with the Devil."
   But in what way soever his connection with this science came about, and
   whether he had dealings or commerce therewith in jest or in earnest, he
   washed away and purged any foolishness or defilement that might have
   clung to him therefrom, by bringing forth fruits meet for repentance
   when he was wholly turned to God. In witness of this when smitten with
   sickness he renounced all unlawful arts in the presence of a priest,
   and gave the books that dealt of such vanities to be burned in the
   fire,

   (6) Let us recognize in all these things the immeasureable depth of the
   Fatherly love of God; and see how the Almighty doth suffer some men to
   be ensnared by the more grievous sins and by wrongful habits, but at
   length of His secret purposes, making manifest a yet greater compassion
   for them, doth restore to life those that were lost, and raiseth the
   fallen to repentance. He doth grant them not only pardon for past sins,
   but also a store of higher grace when they are wholly turned to Him,
   and are striving to be profitable servants. He knoweth how to convert
   the provocations devised by the Devil for the confusion and ruin of
   man, into means of earning a crown of greater glory. If there is joy in
   the presence of the angels over one sinner that repenteth, how great a
   joy must there have been over Gerard, who not only repented of his own
   sins, but also by his example and precept turned so many other sinners
   to repentance, and laboured to draw a great company of faithful people
   to the Kingdom of Heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIV

   Of the abundant fruit which he bore in the conversion of men

   (1)

   INASMUCH as every tree is known by his fruit, as Christ Himself beareth
   witness, I must now declare how rich and how abundant were the fruits
   of godliness which this tree bore during the short season of his
   preaching. I think that venerable and learned Master is worthy to be
   compared to three trees above all others; to the fertile olive, to the
   lofty cedar, and to the flourishing palm. For he, being planted like a
   fruitful tree by the water side, brought forth in his season most
   excellent increase to God. Moreover, as a stream running over with the
   waters of the Scriptures, he irrigated the vineyard of the Lord God of
   Sabaoth abundantly, whence the clusters of devout life, and the green
   leaves of good works were increased to the Glory of God our Saviour.
   This man of God was no barren stock, nor a forest tree whose leaf
   falleth, like the oak; but in very truth he flourished abundantly, like
   some fair olive in the field, as a noble cedar aloft in Libanus, and as
   a goodly palm upon the hill of Zion. The merciful God bestowed great
   grace upon him, which he received not with an empty heart, but used the
   same to the bringing forth of good works; he, therefore, who had been
   aforetime an occasion of error to many and a companion of the foolish,
   now became an ensample of virtue to all. The more he perceived how
   grievously he had erred in the paths of evil, so much the more humble
   did he now become, and the more zealous to tread in the right way.
   Wherefore being renewed and set on fire by the Spirit of God he was
   instant to be more diligent in works of mercy, in succouring his
   neighbours (being moved thereto by deep compassion); in preaching the
   Word of Salvation to the peoples; in administering, like a holy
   physician of souls, the comfort of Divine consolation to the sorrowful
   and the tempted: and in recalling back-sliders to their former
   earnestness of mind by frequent exhortation, prayer and lamentation.

   (2) Because he had obtained great mercy from the Lord, and with true
   charity was eager to share the same liberally, and whensoever he could,
   with his neighbour, he might justly say with the holy poet David: "But
   I have borne fruit like an olive tree in the house of the Lord: I have
   hoped in the Mercy of God for ever." He was not hard of heart and
   pitiless like that wicked servant who, though all his own debt was
   forgiven him, had not compassion upon his fellow servant: but from the
   beginning of his conversion, he forgave every debt of those that
   trespassed against him; prayed earnestly for those that slandered him;
   was ready to be beforehand in giving satisfaction if he had offended
   any, and to live peaceably with all so that the defence of the Truth
   were not endangered. Nor did he, like that slothful servant, hide his
   Lord's money, looking only to his own convenience; but the gift of
   learning, and that talent which was entrusted to him he faithfully put
   out to earn an usury of souls. Rightly then is he compared to a
   fruitful olive, for he poured forth upon his neighbour in holy
   abundance the oil of mercy which he had received from God. But he put
   on bowels of mercy chiefly toward indigent clerks, lone widows, and
   virgins who preserved their chastity, and upon these he expended the
   anxious care of a father; also he studied to minister to the
   necessities of them that lacked both by his own efforts and through
   others, giving them whatsoever help and consolation he could.

   (3) With reason, too, is he compared to a lofty cedar that groweth
   upward, because by his contempt of all earthly things and his
   contemplation of the Eternal, he grew toward Heaven: and knowing his
   own frailty, he rooted his heart in the depths of humility, and in
   proportion as his roots became finer and more deeply planted, so did he
   spread the more widely above. Although he was endowed with so much
   knowledge, and was in so great reputation with the famous doctors of
   his time, he nevertheless despised every pinnacle of worldly honour,
   and kept himself simple in bearing, so that anyone who did not know him
   would scarcely have given heed to, or saluted him.

   Well, too, is the Master likened to a flourishing palm tree, for with
   the leaves of this were victors and fighters of old wont to be crowned;
   and, like them, Gerard strove against and overcame his enemies, that
   is, men guilty of heresies, simony, usury, self-seeking, lust, and the
   other various monsters of wickedness, enduring many labours and using
   the writings of the Scriptures as the weapons wherewith he was armed.
   Therefore was he worthy to be crowned with the palm of everlasting
   bliss, and to be commended of faithful people with due reverence and
   praise. Behold him! an Israelite indeed, a most devoted preacher and
   champion of sound doctrine: one who so loved God as not to neglect his
   neighbour: who so lifted his mind to the things of Heaven as not to be
   backward in ministering to the necessities of others, who moreover
   busied himself in looking not to his own salvation only but to the weal
   of many, and in leading them with him to the more perfect life.

   (4) He was of a cheerful countenance, and in speech kindly; calm in
   mind and humble in clothing; in food abstinent, in counsel wise, in
   judgement discreet. Towards evil he was stern, toward virtue zealous.
   Fleeing from idleness he ever exercised himself with something
   profitable to edification: he loved simplicity and followed lowliness,
   thinking upon heavenly things. He was apt to understand hidden matters,
   and was never too much occupied for reading and prayer. Having God ever
   before his eyes he jealously guarded the rights of the Church. He set a
   good example to men of the world, seeking no temporal advantage from
   his preaching, thinking only of the profit of souls, and preaching the
   Gospel without price and without money from the Church. Thus though his
   life was not long, nor crowned with age, yet in his short season he
   brought forth abundant fruit by his preaching, and left behind him in
   divers places most devout disciples and brothers whom he had first
   faithfully built up and set on fire by the grace of that new light
   wherewith he himself was filled.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XV

   Of the devout communities and monasteries which arose through him

   (1)

   THE everlasting wisdom of the Father, and His mercy from on High
   provided that there should be sent so great and good a man as Gerard as
   an ambassador from Heaven to a world which was now growing old and ever
   turning to yet more evil courses: one who had put on the breastplate of
   faith and was sustained by righteousness of life, so that, through him,
   Holy Religion might be made to flourish again, and the devotion of
   Christian people, being oft instructed by his discourses, might again
   grow warm, continue in the worship of God and the observance of His
   commandments, and show works of mercy toward the poor. To resist the
   malice of so many enemies, and to call souls that were perishing out of
   the deep darkness of sin into the light of Truth should seem to be a
   work for no unskilled man; but Gerard was deeply learned, one,
   moreover, who had made trial of many things, and to him the Grace of
   God gave the power of the word: for he was most fully instructed in
   heavenly doctrine and excelled other men in the virtue of his life:
   thus he was able to persuade his hearers to despise the world not only
   by words of human wisdom but even more by the example of his godly
   conversation.

   Such was the inclination amongst the people to hear the Word of God,
   that the Church could scarcely contain the crowd that came together.
   Many left their food, and being drawn by an hunger after righteousness
   postponed their urgent business and ran together to hear his
   discourses: he often delivered two sermons in one day, and sometimes
   continued preaching for three hours or more when fervency of spirit
   took hold upon him. He preached in the chief cities of the diocese of
   Utrecht, Deventer and Zwolle; in Kempen often, and in Utrecht itself
   before the assembled clergy; in the country of Holland at Leyden, Delft
   and Ghent; in Amsterdam (where he delivered his first sermon in the
   vulgar tongue) and in various other towns and well-known villages where
   he hoped to gather fruit and to bring forth new children for God.
   Blessed be God, Who sending His Holy Spirit from Above kindled the
   hearts of His faithful people, and mightily increased them, so that
   from the seed of a few converts there grew many companies of devout
   brethren and sisters who served God in chastity; and to them several
   monasteries of monks and holy nuns owed the origin of their Godly life.

   (2) It is the great glory of Master Gerard that by his preaching so
   great a tree was planted and watered, a tree which after his death,
   though but newly set in the ground, ceased not to flourish in the field
   of the Lord. Although this religious order and these communities of
   devout per sons were first planted in the nearer parts of Holland,
   Gelders and Brabant, they afterwards spread rapidly to the more remote
   regions of Flanders, Frisia, Westphalia and Saxony, for God prospered
   them, and the sweet savour of their good reputation reached even to the
   Apostolic See.

   Now the venerable Master Gerard, being filled with the Holy Ghost, and
   perceiving that by little and little the number of his disciples was
   increasing, and that they were burning with zeal for heavenly warfare,
   took due care and forethought that the devout might come together from
   time to time into one house for mutual exhortation, and that they might
   deal faithfully with one another of the things pertaining to God and to
   the keeping of the law of Charity: and he ordained that if any should
   wish to abide continually together, they should earn their own living
   by the labour of their hands, and, as far as might be, live in common
   under the discipline of the Church. He allowed none to beg in the
   public ways unless compelled by evident necessity, nor toilsomely to go
   round from house to house to obtain alms, but rather he ordered them to
   remain at home, and, as St. Paul taught, to be diligent in the labour
   of their hands, but not to engage in any business which might hinder
   their devotion in the hope of greater gain, lest at the instigation of
   the Devil there might be given to the weak some occasion of falling
   back into their former naughty ways.

   (3) He had it in mind to build a Monastery for Clerks of the order of
   Regular Canons, for he wished to move some of those Clerks who followed
   him and were fitted for such a life, to take the Religious habit in
   order that they might serve as an example to other devout persons, and
   show the way of holiness to any clerks or lay folk that came from
   elsewhere.

   He was moved to institute this religious order chiefly by the especial
   love and reverence he had for that venerable John Ruysbroek, the first
   prior of Grünthal, and for the other brethren in the same place, who
   lived the Religious life and were without reproach. These were they
   whom he had visited in person in Brabant; in them he observed and from
   them derived, a mode of life greatly tending to edification by reason
   of their deep humility and the wearing of a simple garb.

   But although he busied himself with all diligence to find a place and a
   monastery fitted for the Religious Life, he could not accomplish the
   end which he desired, for death was beforehand with him; yet in the
   sight of God the King immortal, invisible, the Founder of all things,
   the intention was counted as if it were the fulfilment of his design,
   and he bequeathed his desire to build a religious house to those most
   beloved disciples whom he had converted, exhorting them not to let so
   great a purpose fall into forgetfulness when he was dead, but to unite
   in lending their aid and counsel in carrying it out so as to further
   the Glory of God. Some of these disciples were they who dwelt in the
   Monastery of Windesheim, and also they who with the help of God first
   founded the house of Agnietenburg near Zwolle.

CHAPTER XVI

   Of his happy death and burial

   (1)

   THIS faithful and prudent servant of the Lord perceiving that the end
   of his days was at hand--for he was smitten by the bolt that must fall
   upon all men--asked for and received the Viaticum of Salvation. He bore
   with patience the stroke from the Hand of the Lord, and like the elect,
   strove not to avoid His scourge, knowing that the more humbly and
   gladly he bore this present chastisement, the more readily should he
   appease the wrath of the Judge Almighty. Resigning himself therefore
   wholly to the Divine Will, and readily submitting himself to the
   ordinance from above, he committed the issue of his strife to God in
   faith and spoke these few words to the brethren who stood about him:

   "Lo! I am called of the Lord, and the time of my dissolution is at
   hand. Augustine and Bernard are knocking at the door; and I may not go
   beyond the bounds which God hath set to my life. I must pay the debt of
   the flesh like other mortals; may God protect my going forth, and may
   my spirit return to Him Who gave it; let the earth cover this poor body
   which was taken from it, but might not long abide thereon; and may He
   for Whose love I have laboured, written, and preached, grant that I
   find peace after death."

   (2) But his disciples were grieved to the heart, and said to him with
   bitter sighing: "What shall we do from henceforth, and who shall teach
   us in time to come? Thou hast been our father and our defender, and
   hast drawn us to God. Now shall our adversaries rejoice, and they of
   the world shall laugh us to scorn, saying: "These have no leader nor
   chief, therefore shall they soon be brought to naught." If when thou
   wert here they dared to mock us and speak evil of us, what shall they
   do when thou art gone? Let prayers for us fall from thy lips, and bring
   aid speedily to the sons whom thou dost leave behind. Through thy
   counsel have we begun to amend; help us that we may persevere."

   The good and pitiful Master, seeing that the hearts of his sons were in
   heavy sorrow for his departure, gave them kindly comfort, saying: "Have
   faith in God, my most beloved, nor fear them of the world that prate
   against you. Stand firm in your holy purpose, for God shall be with you
   where ye are; man shall not prevail to break down that which God hath
   determined shall be builded. So soon as I am come to God, I hope I
   shall cast down upon you flowers out of Heaven, that ye may know the
   Grace of God and produce fruit in the world; and to Him and to His
   saints do I commend you all."

   (3) "Behold Florentius, my beloved disciple, in whom the Holy Spirit
   hath found a resting place, shall be to you a father and ruler. Take
   him in my stead, hear him, and obey his counsel. I know none like him,
   none whom I esteem so highly, or in whom I have such confidence. Him
   must ye love and reverence as a father."

   Thus with kindly words did he comfort his disciples in their bitter
   grief, promising that the help of God should be most surely with them.
   As a bequest he left them neither gold nor silver nor rich estates, but
   only his holy books, his few poor garments, and some worthless and
   ancient vessels in token of his contempt of the world, and to help them
   the more easily to strive after the Kingdom of God.

   At this time there came also to him certain devout scholars who had
   been smitten with the sickness of the Plague, desiring to hear from him
   some wholesome word as a medicine for their souls. To these he spoke
   with clemency, saying: "By continuing ever in the Service of God, if ye
   are well disposed thereunto, ye can meet death with confidence; all
   those lectures which ye have heard shall be counted to you as prayers
   to God, by reason of the pious intention which ye have had toward Him
   in your studies."

   Hearing this the young men were comforted, and returning to their own
   hospice, departed this life having made a good confession, commending
   their souls, which were redeemed by the Blood of Christ, to God and to
   the Holy Angels.

   (4) After the Festival of the Assumption of the Blessed Mary, ever
   Virgin, when the Feastday of St. Bernard (to whom Gerard was especially
   devoted) had dawned, this reverend father, then in the forty-fourth
   year of his age, delivered up to God his soul fortified by the
   Sacraments of the Church, made precious by faith, and ennobled by many
   virtues. He died as the sun was sinking, between the fifth and sixth
   hours in the thirteen hundred and eighty-fourth year after our Lord's
   Incarnation, during the reign of Pope Urban the Sixth, and while that
   most revered lord Florentius de Wevelichoven was Bishop of Utrecht, a
   notable man and adorned by many excellent deeds.

   (5) When the sad report of his death went forth to the people, many
   faithful persons came together to attend the burying of a man so worthy
   of love, and so devoted to God: and the monks and nuns shed pious tears
   performing the due rites for the departed, with prayer and the
   celebration of Masses according to custom. Every rite of the Church
   being duly performed, his body was carried to the Church of the Blessed
   Mary, and was reverently buried therein, where, as all men know, his
   living voice had often preached the Word of God. There he rests in
   peace, not far from the Sanctuary, to rise with the rest of the
   faithful on the last day, through the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord
   who shall judge both the quick and the dead, and this world with fire.

   These words concerning a few out of the many glorious acts of the
   reverend Master Gerard have been written for the edification of the
   brethren who now are, or in time to come shall be, of our community:
   may they tend to the Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   I ask pardon for any error or defect in my discourse, for I know mine
   own unskilfulness and submit myself humbly to the correction of the
   brethren, attributing to the Grace of God any good thing that may be
   found herein written.

   (6) (A novice speaks)

   "Most gladly do I hear these things, and feel that as it were a new
   spirit of devotion is born in me thereby. Oh! that many Masters like to
   him could now be found, who should be constrained to inform the Church
   of God by their excellent example and doctrine. Therefore I shall hold
   in greater reverence and love this noble man who hath been until now
   unknown to me: and wheresoever I shall find treatises written by him or
   concerning his deeds, I shall take heed to read the same carefully and
   diligently to search them out. But I pray if thou dost know any other
   memorable things concerning him, that thou wilt impart them to me
   before thou dost go forward to further matters."

   (7) (The elder Brother answers him.)

   "Although I am hastening to write of other things, yet that I may
   satisfy thy longing by a few words, hear now what a doctor of Theology,
   a Cantor at Paris, who formerly knew Gerard well, writes about him, and
   with how great praise he lauds him now that he is dead."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVII

   Of the noble eulogy passed upon Gerard by a Cantor at Paris

   (1)

   MASTER GERARD of holy memory, he who was called "The Great," has passed
   happily to the Lord. Truly he was "The Great," for in his knowledge of
   all the liberal sciences, both natural and moral, of civil law, canon
   law and of theology, he was second to no one in the world, and all
   these branches of learning were united in him.

   He was a man of such saintliness and gave so good an example in his
   mortification of the flesh; his refusal of temporal advantages; his
   contempt for the world; his brotherly love for all; his zeal for the
   salvation of souls; his effectual preaching; his reprobation and hatred
   of wickedness; his withstanding of heretics; his enforcement of the
   canon law against those that broke the vow of chastity; his conversion
   to the spiritual life of divers men and women who had formerly lived
   according to the world; and his loyalty to our lord Urban the Sixth--in
   all those things I say he gave so good an example, that many thousands
   of men testify to the belief that is in them that he was not less great
   in these virtues than he was in the aforesaid sciences. Master William
   de Salvarvilla, Cantor at Paris, Archdeacon of Brabant in the Church of
   Liege, an eminent doctor in Theology, compiled the above eulogy from
   that which he heard from the lips of men worthy of credit, and from his
   own knowledge of Master Gerard, and he believes beyond all doubt that
   it is true.

   (2) (The novice.)

   "The words of this doctor as to the praise justly due to Master Gerard,
   the first founder of our Brotherhood, agree with what thou hast
   written. For that which the doctor hath written as a brief summary,
   thou hast told at greater length--wherefore the more testimonies I hear
   of that revered man, the more do I rejoice, and give the greater
   credence to his sayings."

   (2) (The elder Brother.)

   "That thou mayest be fashioned to a knowledge of the faithful Master
   not by the testimony of others only, I will set forth certain of the
   very words of his mouth. So shalt thou know clearly what he taught and
   openly declared during his lifetime, when thou dost read his public
   profession of faith."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVIII

   Of his public profession of faith, and of his delivering the true
   Gospel in his preaching

   (1)

   I GERARD, who am called in the vulgar tongue "Groote," do declare in
   the presence of God Almighty and all the Saints, and before you and all
   men, that in regard to those things that are of faith, I have
   steadfastly preached and defended that faith which is certain, pure,
   and Catholic, resting upon Jesus Christ Himself Who is the chief corner
   Stone. Likewise that I have taught and spread abroad like seed, those
   doctrines and methods that are wholesome for morals, sure, undoubted,
   evangelical and apostolic, following the Divinely inspired Scriptures
   and the interpretation and meaning given thereunto by the Saints and
   Fathers, namely: Ambrose, Gregory, Augustine, Jerome, Chrysostom,
   Dionysius, Bernard, Bede, Isidore, Hugo and Richard: and the writings
   of these Fathers, together with those of other Saints, I do hold and
   use as inspired.

   Likewise as to those things which I have written and preached
   concerning Institutes made by men, the matter of the Decrees and
   Decretals, and above all concerning wicked and notorious wantons, I do
   hope that all men who have any intimate knowledge of the law may find
   that those things which I have laid down are either proved certainly
   and beyond doubt, or that (applying the same limits and qualifications
   which are given in my writings and discourses) such men may approve
   thereof as being somewhat safe, or probable, or likely to be true,
   subject always to the judgement of the Holy Roman Church, to whom with
   all humility I everywhere and always submit myself. And if any
   man--which God forbid--should say or feign that I have spoken aught
   against that Faith and sound doctrine which I everywhere defend, and
   should either expressly mention me by name as so doing, or (if he dare
   not so much) should speak more vaguely to that effect, and indirectly
   harass me by making use of the prejudices of Clerks or lay folk;--if
   anyone, I say, shall thus allude to, or openly defame me, his testimony
   shall be found to be lying and deceitful.

   I do receive the doctrine of submission to the Bishop, to whom I pay
   deference in this respect, but if--which God forbid--any such
   accusation against me be found in the writings of our lord the
   Prince-bishop, I do make that answer which the blessed Bernard made to
   certain letters of the chief Pontiff which gave assent to an evil
   report. "Either our Pontiff hath been ensnared by lies, or he hath been
   overcome of importunity."

   (2) Resolutions and Intentions set forth by Master Gerard in the name
   of the Lord, but not confirmed by vows.

   I purpose to order my life for the glory, honour, and service of God
   and the salvation of my soul; to prefer no temporal good either of the
   body, or of honour, or of fortune, or of knowledge, to my soul's
   salvation. To strive to excel in every godly endeavour of which I may
   be assured that I have any knowledge or discernment, having regard to
   my bodily powers and my state of life; of which endeavours I have
   mentioned some hereafter.

   (3) My first resolution is to desire no further preferment, and in the
   future not to set my hope upon, nor to long for any temporal gain; for
   the more I shall have, the more covetous shall I certainly become; and
   in the second place according to the rule of the Primitive Church, thou
   canst not hold several benefices. Likewise if thou doest so, it shall
   repent thee in the hour of thy death; for it is commonly reported that
   never hath any pluralist died without knowing such remorse. The more
   benefices and goods I hold, the more masters have I, and the more
   burdens must I bear; and this is contrary to that freedom of soul which
   is the greatest good in the Spiritual Life. By the holding of great
   possessions the affections are bound, and being bound are held thereby;
   and the desire of such things doth infect the soul, and is repugnant to
   peace of heart and quietness of mind; moreover the cares which are
   connected therewith do often defile and perturb the mind.

   Likewise as the appetite for more possessions must be cut off, so my
   present possessions must be reduced by little and little to a smaller
   compass, for if I can give alms of those things which I have, why
   should I strive after more? If having little I give but little to God,
   it is as if having much I also gave much, for God weigheth not the
   amount of the gift, but rather the heart of the giver; wherefore the
   widow who put in two mites was preferred by Him before the rich. Also I
   see that the things which I now have do exceedingly bind me, and if
   those which I should acquire were added thereto, how much more should I
   be bound? Moreover my present possessions are enough, having regard to
   our Common Life and my position.

   (4) Having achieved this purpose, I resolve that I will not pay court
   to any Cardinal or Ecclesiastic so as to gain benefices or temporal
   goods, because such subservience doth lead to many falls and relapses
   into sin. Thou art weak, and if thou art subservient--except it be to
   God--thou shalt expose thyself to many dangers. Thou art near enough to
   death as it is, and thou art not so strong as to bear any revellings.

   In like manner thou shalt not serve any temporal master for the sake of
   gain; nor shalt thou be willing to practice astrology at the bidding of
   any; nor oughtest thou to let any man in the world persuade thee to
   have dealings with any forbidden science since these are in themselves
   evil in many ways, they cause distrust and suspicion, and they are
   forbidden. Also it is thy duty, so far as it is possible, to drive away
   these superstitions and all other curious arts from the minds of men,
   preserving a quiet mind, purity, and liberty of will. So doing I shall
   please God, by following His good pleasure in these very matters in
   which I formerly displeased Him. Thou shalt never observe the seasons
   that are held to be propitious for journeying, or for blood letting or
   for any other thing save in the material sense of considering the
   density of the atmosphere, for such curious choice is forbidden in the
   decrees and by the Holy Fathers.

   Likewise whatever I shall begin, I will begin it in the name of the
   Lord, and in the matter I will put my hope in the Lord that He will
   direct me therein to the way of my salvation; put not any trust in the
   divining of fate, or in reading the stars, but hope only in God, and in
   prayer; in good angels and their protection. How do I know whether in
   my journey, or mine undertaking success shall be profitable to me?
   Truly such success is very often unprofitable, and difficulties and
   tribulation are ofttimes most profitable; therefore I will submit me to
   the ordinance of God. "Blessed is the man whose hope is in God"; "Cast
   therefore all thy care upon Him, for He careth for thee!" How great is
   the mercy which hath recalled me (as I hope) to Him, by means of
   chastisements which I bore unwillingly! Since we should not be anxious
   as to what we shall eat, how much less should we be so about the
   forecasts of the stars and other superstitions? It is needful for every
   Christian to abandon himself in purity of heart and to commit himself
   to God.

   (5) Also I will never try to anticipate the future, and for the most
   part will think but little upon it, for I will devote to God both
   myself and everything that doth concern me. Man is defiled by honours,
   by favours, and by greed,. after which all men do seek; and by such
   knowledge, whose object is gain, his mind is darkened, his passions are
   aroused, the straightness of his nature is made crooked and his desires
   are tainted, so that he cannot rightly discern what things are of God,
   and virtuous, and good for the body. Wherefore it is very seldom that a
   man who doth follow after knowledge which bringeth him wealth (as the
   study of medicine, or of laws or statutes), is right-minded or just in
   his reasoning, or righteous, or doth live the more contentedly or
   uprightly.

   Do not spend thy time in the study of geometry, arithmetic, rhetoric,
   dialectic, grammar, songs, poetry, legal matters or astrology; for all
   these things are reproved by Seneca, and a good man should withdraw his
   mind's eye therefrom and despise them: How much more, therefore, should
   they be eschewed by a spiritually-minded man and a Christian? Moreover
   such studies are an unprofitable expense of time, and are of no help
   for good living.

   Of all the sciences of the heathen, their Moral Philosophy is least to
   be avoided--for this is often of great use and profit both for one's
   own study and for teaching others. Wherefore the wiser amongst them,
   such as Socrates and Plato, turned all Philosophy into the
   consideration of moral questions, and if they spoke of deep matters
   they dealt therewith as in a figure and lightly, dwelling upon their
   moral aspect (as thou knowest from the blessed Augustine and thine own
   study) so that some rule for conduct might always be found side by side
   with knowledge.

   Seneca, too, following this principle, as often mingles moral
   dissertations with his discussion of natural philosophy; for whatsoever
   doth not make us better, or induce us to avoid evil, is harmful.

   The secrets of nature should not be sought out in the writings of the
   heathen, or in the books of our Law, the Old and New Testaments, but
   when they meet us therein God is to be praised and glorified for them
   and in them; so that the knowledge of natural laws may be of profit and
   be offered as a sacrifice to God Most High by giving thank-offerings to
   Him like righteous Abel, and that like him we may draw holy thoughts
   therefrom to the honour of God. But in everything remember that all
   these things defile the mind and do not satisfy it; and through the
   grace of the Most High, thou shalt find, as I hope, that thou canst not
   stomach them.

   (6) I resolve never to take a degree in medicine, because I do not
   purpose to get any gain or preferment by such a degree; and the same
   resolve doth hold for Civil and canon law; for the purpose of a degree
   is either gain or preferment, or vain glorification and worldly honour,
   which latter things if they lead not to the former, are simply useless,
   empty, and most foolish, being contrary to godliness and all freedom
   and purity. When a man doth crave for them he falleth into many evils,
   and they are worse than the motives of gain and preferment. I resolve
   not to study any art, nor to write any book, nor to undertake any
   journey nor any labour, nor to pursue any science, with the purpose of
   extending mine own fame and repute for knowledge, or of gaining honour,
   or the gratitude of any man or for the sake of leaving a memorial of
   myself behind me. For if I should do these things, or any act
   whatsoever with such motives and take my reward therein, I should not
   be rewarded of my Father Which is in Heaven. If I shall do any of these
   I will do it always for some good purpose, looking for a reward which
   is eternal: wherefore let the extending of my repute be in every way
   avoided. This desire for empty glory, for remembrance, and for fame is
   so admirably reproved, even by the Philosophers, that any man who is
   worthy of praise would scarce harbour such a motive. But if praise
   should follow any deed done really for the sake of God (but the motive
   of which was unseen, though the deed itself was in the light), give
   then that praise and glory to the Most High.

   (7) Likewise after the example of Bernard, utter no word by the which
   thou mayest seem to be very religious, or endowed with knowledge.
   Resolve to avoid and abhor all public disputations which are but
   wranglings for success in argument, or the appearance thereof (such as
   the disputations of graduates in Theology and Arts at Paris), and take
   no part therein. These are unprofitable, always concerned with mere
   subtleties, and for the most part superstitious, sensual, devilish or
   earthly, so that the teaching thereof is often hurtful, ever
   unprofitable, and a useless waste of time;--meanwhile thou canst gain
   spiritual profit by prayer, or meditation, or the study of some holy
   book.

   So also I will never argue with anyone in private unless it is certain
   and evident that some good end shall follow, or unless my fellow
   disputant doth desire to hear me, or is one with whom I can confer
   without wrangling, and temperately which conditions are to be observed
   except when malice doth demand severity for some eventual good: but
   even so I will never act without due deliberation. It is evident that
   to attain a good end, everything must ever be ordered for the Glory of
   God; that is, that one must pray continually: wherefore talk not with
   anyone unless he doth admit the truth.

   (8) Thou shalt never study to take a degree in Theology, nor strive
   therefor, because: (l.) I care not to follow after gain or preferment
   or reputation, and knowledge I may have equally well without a degree.
   (2.) The common life of an university is carnal and is for them that
   savour carnal things. (3) In many respects thou mayest be hindered from
   promoting the spiritual health of thy neighbour, from prayer, from
   purity of mind and from contemplation. (4) One must be present at many
   vain lectures and be in the company of a multitude of men, by which
   things a man is defiled and turned from his path.

   Thou shalt never busy thyself with law or medicine save when occasion
   ariseth and when thou canst do some good thereby, for: (l) These
   studies have no nourishment in them, but do turn aside the mind; yet
   for the sake of peacemaking, or in case of necessity, or when some
   urgent cause ariseth one may meddle with law; and with medicine also
   for the sake of one's own bodily health or that of a fellow man. (2)
   These be worldly matters in which it is convenient rather to take the
   counsel of others, than to give advice. (3) The study of medicine is
   forbidden to Divines, Monks, and them that do long after the Law of
   God.

   Thou shalt not give medicine of doubtful virtue, nor prescribe any
   medicine whatever for a disease the nature whereof is uncertain, nor
   give a potion to any sick man save under most urgent necessity when no
   other adviser may be had; otherwise thou shalt never intrude thyself:
   thou seest how greatly good men do rejoice in being freed from
   practising this art.

   Thou shalt not advise upon, nor busy thyself with causes concerning
   matters of opinion or controversy unless: (1) It be clearly apparent to
   thee that otherwise some falsehood might be propagated; or (2) for
   Charity's sake; or (3) the whole cause be that of righteousness; or (4)
   it be most certainly for the curbing of evil manners; or (5) to prevent
   the oppression of the poor; or (6) unless thou canst intervene and yet
   preserve an equal mind. After such interference withdraw thyself so
   that there remain to thee no care for the residue of the matter.
   Likewise take good heed that thou be careful not to be moved by
   friendship, or kinship, or hatred, and if thy friend or kinsman, or one
   that was aforetime thine enemy be concerned, search thy heart to know
   if thou wouldest act in the same manner if he were a stranger or not
   thine enemy. It is evident, as Virgil saith, that the happiness of the
   dweller in the country is that "he hath not looked upon the iron rigour
   of the law and the mad turmoil of the Forum."

   Thou shalt not appear before a spiritual officer or judge, as a favour
   to any friend or kinsman or other man, nor at all unless the most
   urgent call of duty require it. If such case of necessity urge thee,
   thou oughtest to send a deputy, and not to go thyself, because by this
   is quietness of mind disturbed if thou dost intrude thyself into the
   affairs, the tumult and tempest of the world. In all other conditions
   let the dead bury their dead. Thou shalt not appear before the civil
   magistrates or the secular judge in Deventer save in the case of
   similar necessity, for thy friends deal well enough with all such
   matters before magistrates.

   Never busy thyself with any controversies of men whatsoever (save as
   above) unless it be to compose them, and when this can be done in a
   short time and without brawling. Even when such composition ought to be
   made, if it can be done as well by another, do not intrude thyself;
   always consider this. Yet put not aside the making of peace when thou
   canst truly make it, out of deference to thine own quietness.

   (10) Whensoever any kinsman of thine is beaten, or slain, or evilly
   entreated, thou shalt never evilly entreat him that did the injury; nor
   ever give counsel against him to his hurt; nor ever close thy mouth
   against him, nor avoid him. Rather admonish him with words of comfort,
   or lead him back to peace. Also if his friends would take vengeance
   thou shalt dissuade them therefrom with words of peace, and from injury
   that they do it not.

   Do thou forgive all men, and be an ensample in so doing, and so much
   the more as thou dost admonish others. I will never have part in the
   doings of my friends or kinsmen or betters, save only such as are acts
   of piety, tending to mercy and duty and justice, and also such as may
   not be done so well through another man. Yet would it be evil to turn
   aside, for the sake of preserving mine own quietness, from works of
   piety and justice which could not be done through another, and from my
   duty in serving my neighbour.

   Of the study of Holy Books

   (11) I now return to consider the pursuit of knowledge. Let the root of
   thy study and the mirror of thy life be these: First, the Gospel of
   Christ, for therein is the Life of Christ. (2) The lives and discourses
   of the Fathers. (3) The Epistles of Paul and the other Canonical
   Epistles, and the Acts of the Apostles. (4) Holy Books, as the
   meditations of Bernard and the Horologium of Anselm, Bernard on the
   Conscience, the Soliloquies of Augustine, and suchlike books. (5) The
   legends and devotions of the Saints, the Instructions of the Fathers on
   Conduct, such as the Pastoral of Gregory, the blessed Augustine on
   Monastic work, Gregory on Job, and so forth. (6) The Homilies of the
   Holy Fathers and of the Four Doctors upon the Gospels, the
   Interpretations of the Holy Fathers and Commentaries upon the Epistles
   of Paul, for these are included in the authorized readings of the
   Church. (7) The study of the Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes and
   Ecclesiasticus, for these are included in the lectionaries and
   authorized readings of the Church. "I will pray with the spirit and I
   will pray with the understanding also." (8) The study and
   interpretation of the Psalter, for this is included in the services of
   the Church of the Holy Fathers. "I will sing with the spirit and I will
   sing with the understanding also." (9) The study of the Books of Moses;
   the historical books--Joshua, Judges and Kings; of the Prophets and the
   expositions of the Fathers upon the same.

   (12) As to the manner of perusing the Decrees, so as to know what was
   determined of our forefathers and of the Church: one must not strive to
   master them, but only peruse them; (l) lest through ignorance of the
   law thou pervert piety into disobedience. (2) That thou mayest see the
   material fruit of the Primitive Church. (3) That thou mayest know from
   what thou thyself shouldest refrain, and from what thou shouldest
   admonish others to refrain.

   (13) Thou oughtest to hear Mass to the end, every day that thou canst,
   for thus it is ordained even for lay folk on Sundays in the directions
   for the Mass (de consec, I. C.) and for Clerks that they hear It daily,
   as is said in the note in the same place. Also remain in the Church on
   feast days until the solemnization of the Mass is completed. Singing 1
   is a help to devotion for the natural body as thou knowest by
   experience. One should always rise for the reading of the Gospel, and
   stand up, wherefore it is said in the directions (de consec. I. C.):
   "By our Apostolic authority we command that men sit not, but stand,
   reverently bending at the reading of the Gospel." In the word
   reverently is implied the honour due to the Gospel, as also in the
   place wherein it is said: "Let them hear the words thereof with
   attention and adore with faith," that is, "Let them show reverence by
   the posture of the body"; this doth consist--first in the bending,
   secondly in the lowering of the hood as is customary, thirdly in bowing
   at the Names of Jesus and Mary; for those devoted to God have this
   custom.

   Likewise, when the Gospel is read, the mind should not occupy itself
   with any other devotion, or reading which doth demand attention; for
   the senses, when occupied upon several matters, are less intent upon
   any single one. The words of the Gospel and of the Apostolic writings
   are ordained to be heard at the Celebrations, as is said in the
   directions (de consec. I. D.): "It is vain to hear if we attend not."

   Moreover, one should read nothing nor meditate upon aught else, for the
   duty of the moment is to attend duly to the Gospel, and we do take away
   therefrom any attention which we may expend upon other prayers and
   meditations. Our bowing ourselves at these words and the bodily posture
   of reverence are symbols of the reverence of our minds, and these be
   false symbols if so be that the things signified answer not thereto.
   Moreover, the outward observance is a means to induce inward reverence,
   but it is vain if the one answer not to the other.

   (14) Furthermore, to be reverent with the lips and the understanding
   also is a greater thing than to show reverence with the lips only, or
   by the lowering of the hood; wherefore I will lower my hood to hear, I
   will hear with the ear, and I will hear with the understanding also.
   Otherwise the words are as a tinkling cymbal or as sounding brass. No
   words or sayings are mine own if the meaning thereof doth not reach my
   mind--also thou shalt stand with bended knee, with head uncovered and
   with bowed back after the Consecration of the Sacred Host, if thou art
   able to see It, or the Chalice. This humble adoration and abasement of
   body is seemly before God, and doth in every way betoken an attitude of
   mind which is fitting as a help to devotion; yea, and most fitting is
   the bending of the head over the arm as thou dost know: for the servant
   is by all means bound to show reverence in the presence of his Lord. A
   bended posture doth admirably befit devotion of mind, for the motions
   of the spirit do bear relation to the posture of the body. When thou
   art afar off or canst not see, prostrate thyself and bow thine head and
   pray to thy God in secret from the Sanctus to the Pax, and afterward,
   whether thou dost partake or not, until the Gospel of St. John.

   (15) Receive the Pax with reverence and devotion, for it is a contact
   with the Body of the Lord through the mouth of the priest. Is not
   reverence paid to The Veronica, and to the picture of Christ, though it
   is not sanctified by His bodily presence? In the Primitive Church all
   the faithful were wont to communicate, and in place of such Communion
   the Pax is given as being in some measure a receiving of Christ's Body.
   The reason (as I hold) that His Body is not now given so generally is
   that in the Primitive Church when His Blood was but lately shed, men
   were better, and religious fervour was in full vigour and at its
   height: but this is now grown old, wherefore He hath withdrawn Himself.

   When the Pax doth come be thou prepared as if thou didst verily receive
   the Body of Christ, and at that time lift up the love of thine heart
   and prepare thyself so that though thou are not able carnally to
   receive the Elements of the Holy Sacrament, thou mayest at least do so
   in the Spirit. After receiving such communion through the Pax, the love
   of thine heart must abide and endure inwardly; but if thou dost begin
   to wander in mind, as doth often happen to thee when thou dost meditate
   without ordering thy thoughts beforehand, turn thy mind to Christ's
   Passion.

   (16) Likewise from the Sanctus onward prepare to look upon the
   Host--are not all men wont to make preparation before looking upon
   their King, by whom also they must be seen? After this make thyself
   ready for the Reception and do nought besides, for at that time the
   Presence of Christ doth work upon thee and doth help thy weakness; thus
   shalt thou be moved to love the Sacrament. This is evident from the
   words wherein it is said, "Lift up your hearts" and "We have lifted
   them up to the Lord."

   Also always draw so near the Priest as thy condition doth permit, to
   hear the Mass and to look upon the Host, and stand in the Presence
   Thereof. Be not willing to consult for any man that he may be ordained,
   nor to speak for him, nor assist him to this end unless he be most
   devout. The first of these resolutions is on account of the responses
   pertaining to the office which ought to be made, and are not made, as
   is shown in the fourth of the Sentences and in the Decrees; the second
   is, on account of the risk of Simony which doth often occur; and also,
   by reason of the unprofitable state of the Church.

   With regard to abstinence these things seem good, but are not the
   subject of promise. First to keep the fasts that are ordained;
   secondly, never to eat flesh meats. The reasons hereof are to be found
   in the Chapter of the Decrees which is called Margarita (de consec.,
   § v). Thirdly, save for just cause, not to omit to fast during Advent
   and Septuagesima. Fourthly, let there be a daily fast which doth
   consist in not wholly satisfying the appetite unless cold weather doth
   hinder this resolve. All philosophers do advise this, specially Seneca
   and Aristotle. Withhold thy hand while appetite doth yet remain: the
   moment of its satisfaction is hard to know, yet do thou thus reflect
   upon it by considering how much thou wouldst wish to eat if it were
   right for thee to consult thy desire, and while this doth still endure,
   deny some part thereof as shall seem reasonable to thee.

   Fifthly, toward the close of a meal, or before partaking of the last
   dish, consider how much thou hast consumed, and how much more thou
   wouldest eat if thou didst continue, and in future omit somewhat of the
   earlier or latter part of the meal. Sixthly, at the beginning when thou
   dost set forth to prepare thy food think upon the victual and how much
   thou dost require. Seventhly, take but one cooked pear after thy meal,
   and that not of inordinate size, or three of the very smallest.
   Eighthly, always eat in the evening between the fourth and fifth hours,
   unless the presence of guests, or infirmity, or some accident, such as
   a journey, compel thee. This is approved for the following reasons: (1)
   This hour is convenient for digestion and for the hindering of that
   corruption of food in the stomach which would take place in waking
   hours through lack of warmth; (2) during waking hours study and other
   matters such as care or sadness do impede digestion; (3) take food at
   this time lest drink following food may hinder digestion; (4) it doth
   prevent drink so taken from causing disturbance as otherwise doth often
   happen; (5) lest raw fruit, vegetables, and the like might do hurt as
   they would if taken in the daytime; (6) thy sleep will be the better,
   for a full belly doth slumber readily; (7) at that time study and
   prayer which are the portion of the daytime do less hinder sleep; (8)
   by this custom thou wilt get thee to bed quickly, and always at the
   same hour; (9) by so doing one may get continuous sleep through going
   to rest in good time; (10) the love of study will not tempt thee too
   much at night; (11) by this means thou hast the day unbroken for work
   and prayer. (12) Thus, all thy waking hours are spent in abstinence and
   fasting, are unhindered and fit for the service of God and for work.
   Also a man hath more desire for food when he is eating than when he is
   altogether abstaining, so that one cannot so readily practise
   abstinence when near to or at the table. From the Exaltation of the
   Holy Cross till Easter take but one daily meal; this is the custom of
   the Carthusians and Bernardines and others: this Season doth begin in
   September about the Equinox, and doth continue until near about the
   Vernal Equinox.

   (17) In seasons of great cold it is lawful to take more food, but yet
   not exceeding one meal daily;--such is the teaching of Hippocrates;
   this doth help thee to resist the cold, which thou couldst scarce do
   otherwise; for the same reason thou mayest sleep longer by one hour or
   an hour and a half. When it is needful to eat twice in the day take a
   small amount, and food of light quality, such as one egg and no more,
   or rather some drying food as bread and wine, or vegetables, with a
   little bread, but if thou take wine let it be for thy stomach's sake.
   The reasons of this are as above, where I have argued of the need to
   eat at night.

   I would wish to be able never to drink wine unnecessarily so long as I
   am in good health, lest I violate the precepts of Paul; for to do so is
   luxury and is over costly. One should never drink immediately before or
   after a meal, nor during the course thereof unless infirmity or some
   most urgent cause compel. During and after manual work one should by no
   means drink anything unless the body is cool: this is healthy for body
   and soul. Let nothing lead thee to drink between times, or so as to
   break a fast: it is good to bind thy feet in the fetters of wisdom. Set
   a time wherein to read what thou dost write in this book for it doth
   order thy life. It doth seem to me that the fathers in the desert
   offered short and frequent prayers, so that the heart might be raised
   continually to the Lord, and might not be set on worldly affairs, but
   be abstracted therefrom, and thus should one do.

   (18) I do purpose in the Name of the Lord always to fast upon the
   fourth day of the week unless infirmity, or reasonable cause hinder me.
   Yet this I ordain not as an unalterable rule, but as somewhat whereat
   to strive; and so also on the Sabbath, and on the sixth day--for upon
   the fourth Judas betrayed the Lord, and on the sixth was He crucified.
   He who fasteth not on these days doth needlessly betray Him and taketh
   part with His murderers. I am the more bound to observe these days in
   that by the apportionment of God it is my lot to be a Clerk, moreover
   by such fast my health is preserved and I do feel that thereby my soul
   is better with her God. But even if such abstinence should seem to hurt
   the body in some small measure, think not of that, for thou hast always
   been in better health when thou didst fast. Ever pay some tribute to
   thy God, and thou wilt ever remember Him the better.

   (19) Avoid haste, eagerness, and gluttony in eating, for such greed
   proceedeth from inordinate love of its object. A greedy mouth and lust
   for meat have an intermixture of sin. Gregory in his Exposition of Job
   saith: "This doth stir up loquacity, leadeth to excess, doth heat the
   mind and turn it from the path just as drunkenness or too much talk do
   kindle it and lead it into snares."

   This doth also cut off and shut out all thought of God.

   It is better to do one action well with great deliberation, than
   through lack thereof to be thrown out of one's course. Also, as
   concerneth bodily health, in proportion as food is taken well and with
   deliberation, so much the more readily and wholesomely is it digested.
   The same habit of deliberation should prevail in writing and speaking
   and in action also, because it is impossible to seek therein the Glory
   of God, if a man so impetuously rush into a matter that his whole
   strength is occupied in it. Learn then to be slow and restrained in
   action.

   Do not do any good thing in such a way as to run into disobedience. In
   matters of temporal wealth, repayments, and expenditure upon books,
   regard thyself as a steward, and look to it that thou be found
   faithful. Therefore be frugal in supplying to thyself food and raiment,
   that thou mayest the better supply the needy, and worthier men than
   thou, and mayest promote the salvation of souls. Never give aught that
   is of any worth to one that is not needy, for thou wilt find very many
   that are in want, and if thou dost give to them that have abundance,
   thou art not a faithful steward, nor prudent to thine own salvation. In
   thy giving take no thought of carnal things. I will not receive
   temporal gifts from any man so long as needier persons than I may be
   found, for what I would not do myself, that will I not ask of another.

   (20) Likewise, Gerard said, a man ought not to be disturbed about any
   affair of this world. He who doeth that which he knoweth, doth deserve
   to know much. He who doeth not that which he knoweth doth deserve to be
   in darkness.

   It is a great matter to obey in those things which are contrary to our
   natural man, and are burdensome--this is true obedience.

   Before all things and in all things study specially to be humble
   inwardly, and also outwardly before the brethren.

   The knowledge of all knowledge is for a man to know that he knoweth
   nothing.

   The more a man is assured that he is far from perfection, the nearer is
   he thereto.

   The beginning of vainglory is to be pleasing to oneself.

   By this is a man known better than by aught else, that he is praised.

   Thou oughtest always to strive to note some good in another, and to
   think thereof.

   Inordinate desire for anything not pertaining to God is as the sin of
   fornication: therefore the prophet saith: "It is good for me to cleave
   to God."

   We ought to be strenuous in prayer, and not lightly to desist from it
   nor think that God is unwilling to hear us.--Though oftentimes
   repelled, we should not despair.

   He who is faint-hearted should pray as a son to a good father, as is
   said in the Gospel: "Which of you if he ask his father bread, will he
   give him a stone," and so forth.

   In everything in the whole world there is temptation, though a man
   perceive it not.

   (21) The greatest of temptations is not to feel temptation; so long as
   a man knoweth that there is somewhat in him to be pruned away, so long
   doth he stand well.

   When any evil is suggested to thee, think what thou wouldest ask thy
   fellows to do in like case, then doth the Devil stand confused.

   Always dwell more upon the hope of Eternal Glory than upon fear of
   Hell.

   Let every man beware of causing scandal to others by his conduct; let
   him study to amend the same, and everywhere to behave himself honestly,
   that others may be the more edified.

   With whatsoever thoughts a man doth fall asleep, with such doth he
   awaken; at these times it is well to pray or to read some psalms.

   Slight shame borne here doth do away unending shame before God and all
   the Saints.

   Study only to please Him Who doth know thee and all that pertaineth to
   thee: suppose that thou dost please all men but dost displease God;
   what should it profit thee? therefore turn away thy heart from the
   creature, yea, even with great violence.

   Think how thou mayest be altogether conqueror of thyself and lift up
   thy heart ever to God, as saith the prophet: "Mine eyes are ever toward
   the Lord."

   Thanks be to God.

APPENDIX TO THE LIFE OF GERARD GROOTE

   A Letter to the Bishop of Utrecht on behalf of Master Gerard Groote
   when he was forbidden to preach publickly.

   Most Potent Father, and Prince of the people of Utrecht,

   IT hath happened lately that Gerard Groote, a deacon of your Diocese,
   inspired by the Lord, and kindled with zeal to preach the Word even in
   these latter days, hath denounced before clerks and lay-folk their
   wickedness, and maintained wholesome, true, Evangelical and Apostolic
   doctrine as against heretics, usurers, and clerks that live in
   concubinage. Acting with your license and that of the Parochial Clergy
   he hath preached also against various crimes and corruptions of divers
   men in your diocese, not without some fruit, and hath sown the seed not
   without increase (as he doth hope). For by his preaching the hearts of
   many have been turned to the Lord, leaving their former perverse and
   evil courses.

   Through his labours there are many virgins set as flowers in the field
   of the Lord; lives of chaste widowhood and voluntary poverty, as an
   harvest therein; renunciations of the world, acts of restitution and
   many other fruits sprung from the seed of Ecclesiastical and Catholic
   doctrine; and these things are seen and known of them that do truly
   love God.

   By his means also the boldness of certain heretics who creep in secret
   places on the earth hath been kept down, and the wickedness of usury
   and disordered lust have ceased from the land of Zeeland. But yet these
   clerks and priests that live in concubinage have procured (as we
   suppose) by means of a letter obtained from you that this Gerard should
   be restrained indirectly from exercising the office of a preacher, and
   this either without cause, or without any that he knoweth.

   For although your letter did apply to all priests, yet almost all save
   Gerard have been restored to their offices; and this, as he thinks,
   doth arise not from the deliberate intention of the bishop, but through
   the suggestions of malicious men causing no small loss and detriment to
   the cause of Holy edification. At this do heretics rejoice and creep
   about more boldly; for this cause are those enemies of the Church glad,
   namely the Clerks who live in concubinage, continuing to live most
   uncleanly in the lusts of the flesh: usurers are well pleased, and
   scandals are increased, yea, even more perchance than carnal and
   worldly minds can comprehend. Although this Gerard calleth God to
   witness that so far as he himself is concerned he would wish to be at
   leisure to explore the truth, and to be quiet, yet he perceives that
   the enemy of mankind is everywhere striving against men and is driving
   them over the precipices and into the abyss of sin; and he hath hope
   that some of these may by his preaching be delivered from the snare of
   the hunter and from the noisome pestilence, which hope the effects of
   his former preaching do justify; therefore he is stirred by zeal for
   the House of the Lord, inflamed and urged by love for his neighbour to
   preach and sow the seed of the Word of God (if it may be) without
   temporal reward, in poverty and with humility but in all truth, as
   formerly he preached and sowed the same not without visible fruit. If a
   special license is refused him he doth ask that at least the parochial
   clergy may not be forbidden to employ him if they will; for according
   to the custom of the State and diocese of Utrecht they have been wont
   always to employ any trusty and good preachers whom they would, without
   such license. Furthermore if in spite of the good fruit his preaching
   hath borne, and the aforesaid custom, you should wish to inhibit Gerard
   from preaching (which thing God forbid should happen in your
   dominions), he doth ask and humbly and urgently desire of you: (1) to
   declare to him the pretext and reason of such inhibition; (2) not to
   judge him, deprive him of his right, nor suspend him from the exercise
   thereof without such admonitions as ought always to precede judgement;
   for he is ready to argue each several doctrine that he doth teach in
   public and private, not only before you, Father, but also before any
   man, and truly to prove the same from the sacred writings of the Saints
   and from the Scriptures: and if it be necessary to lay them before the
   Supreme Pontiff.

   A Letter of Master William de Salvarvilla, a Cantor at Paris, to Pope
   Urban VI, asking that a license to preach be granted to Master Gerard.

   To our most Holy Father in Christ, our Lord Urban VI., by Divine
   Providence Pope, Supreme Pontiff of the Inviolable Church of Rome, and
   of the whole world, these from your Holiness' most humble petitioner
   and servant William de Salvarvilla, Chanter of Paris and Archdeacon of
   Brabant in the Church of Liege.

   MOST HOLY FATHER,

   In all subjection and most humbly and devoutly kissing the feet of your
   Holiness, I do write that which followeth in singleness of heart, being
   zealous (as I believe) for the service of God.

   There is a certain reverend man Gerard Groote, a Deacon of the diocese
   of Utrecht, learned in the sciences both liberal, natural and moral,
   and also in Theology and Canon Law. He hath long ago given over all his
   benefices for God's sake, namely prebends at Utrecht and Aix, and also
   his patrimony, which was no small one, having retained but a small part
   of the same to provide him a slender sustenance. To him is the world
   crucified, and he to the world; he hath become a mighty adversary to
   heretics, a zealous upholder of the unity of the Church, and a fervent
   preacher in the said diocese as against the sins of lay folk and
   clerks; yet he hath not received or asked for any recompense for his
   preaching, nor doth he seek any temporal or Ecclesiastical Benefice,
   but he doth desire to have a further Commission under the authority of
   the Apostolic See to the end that he may be able to preach more freely
   and without hindrance. Wherefore it would seem expedient, as I judge,
   that your Holiness should give him authority to preach and to make
   inquisition against heretics; and likewise to publish the Canonical
   decree of your Holiness granting such authority in the Province of
   Cologne or at least in the aforesaid diocese of Utrecht.

   May the Most High see fit to preserve your Holiness in prosperity, to
   be the ruler of His Church.

   Given at Leyden on the 21st day of October.

   The following epitaph on Gerard is appended to A Kempis' Life of the
   Master as edited by Somalius. It is uncertain whether A Kempis was the
   author of the lines, but from the title "Epitaphium vetus et
   inconditum" it would seem probable that they are by a different hand.
   As it is impossible to reproduce the rhyme and metre of the original in
   a translation, the Latin text of the Epitaph is here given:

   EPITAPHIUM VETUS ET INCONDITUM VENERABILIS MAGISTRI GERARDI MAGNI


   Gerardus Magnus vixit sicut plus agnus,

   Fecit quod dixit, sicut docuit quoque vixit.

   Sicut non fictus aliis mitis sibi strictus

   Lux fuerat Cleri, tradens huic lumina veri,

   Lux fuerat pravis, oculus mentis bene gnavis.

   Hic Mundo spretus, sed pneumate corde repletus

   Ejus doctrina, falsis fuerat quasi spina

   Ridiculum vanis, odium mentis male sanis

   Quae falsos laesit, pars veridicis sed adhaesit

   Illi pro vero, fuit utilis hic quia clero

   Ut clero laicis, prodesse volens inimicis,

   Doctrina veri, debet Christus misereri

   Ejus de jure, pro tali pondere curae.

   Talis namque fore, voluit gratis sed amore

   Divino tactus, nulla mercede coactus

   Namque resignavit praebendas sicut amavit

   Christum, sic stravit carnem tenues quoque pavit,

   De propriisque bonis tenuit regimen rationis.

   Sic fuit exemplo lux in Christi bene templo.

   Gerardus Magnus, quem verus diligit Agnus,

   Sanctorum sortem tenet evincens modo mortem.

THE LIFE OF THE REVERED FLORENTIUS,

A DEVOUT PRIEST, AND VICAR

OF THE CHURCH OF

DEVENTER
     __________________________________________________________________

                             THE LIFE OF FLORENTIUS

PREFACE

   (1)

   FOLLOWING the order laid down, I do now think good to write certain
   things concerning the life and character of Florentius, that Reverend
   Father of pious memory, Priest of the Church of Deventer, and once a
   disciple of that Master Gerard of whom I have told above. This order in
   my history is fitting, that having first shown the fertility of the
   good tree in Gerard, the founder of our Devotion, I should next exhibit
   the sweetness of the fair flower thereof in the godly Florentius, his
   disciple, for he was eminent as a follower of the same Devotion and a
   most fervent promoter of it.

   His humble and obedient character was indeed an herb of healing for the
   drooping soul, and his saintly virtues are an instruction to young and
   old alike.

   (2) I beseech thee, good brother, that thou interpret not the
   artlessness of my words to the injury of this illustrious priest, for
   he was himself a lover of humility and artlessness; but do thou read
   and mark the good things that I shall tell of him with the eyes of
   pious deference. Do as doth the provident bee drawing sweet honey from
   fair flowers in some green meadow, and (for the edification of thy
   condition and order) sow the seeds of those virtues which adorned our
   beloved Father Florentius, and plant his example in the garden of thy
   soul, to bear as it were flowers of roses, and sweet-scented lilies
   therein. So shalt thou go forward continually in virtue, and thine
   heart shall glow yet more fervently in the furnace of the love of
   Christ. He was a mirror of virtue notable indeed, and to all that
   desire to serve God, one that doth help them to reach the Kingdom of
   Heaven. Since I had intimate knowledge of him, and did oft stand by and
   minister to him, I am so much the more competent to speak truly
   concerning his life.

   Novice

   (3) I pray thee complete to the honour of God that work which thou
   didst undertake at my desire and that of others; for it will be a joy
   to them that come after to hear how bright were the stars which did
   shine forth in our land. And thou, too, mayest be a partaker in their
   merits, if in brotherly love thou art willing to impart to others that
   knowledge which thou hast freely received.

   The Elder Brother.

   (4) The task which I approach is toilsome and one that is too heavy for
   my knowledge and my feeble powers. I would choose rather to be silent
   and read the words of others, than to cast a shadow upon the bright
   fame of that illustrious man by telling thereof in my homely and
   barbarous speech. But since thou dost not inquire into niceties of
   style but rather moral worth in the subject, therefore in despite of
   mine unskill in words thou must not despise my pearls though the shells
   wherein they are found be worthless.

   I confess that I am not so skilful as to be able to set forth the life
   of so great a father; yet I do offer in the temple of God goat skins to
   cover the roof of the tabernacle, for I have no precious stones
   wherewith to adorn the vestment of the priest. Also it would seem to me
   a hard-hearted and ungrateful thing if I should keep silence as to the
   virtues of a father so beloved though I am unworthy to tell of them,
   for in his life he was a benefactor to me and to many others: he first
   launched me for the service of God, and in the fulness of time steered
   me to the haven of the monastery. Wherefore in gratitude and for a
   sweet remembrance of him I in turn do gladly repay his bounty, now he
   is gone, by the finishing of this poor work. Let it be as some excuse
   for the task that I have taken on me, that I deeply love this reverend
   Father, and hope that his memory may always and everywhere flourish
   among devout men: And may the Lord Jesus who despised not the poor
   widow's two mites, reward me, his poor servant, in the time to come,
   for that with a good intention I do put this labour of my hands into
   His treasury, leaving higher themes to men more learned. Knowing mine
   own littleness I submit to the correction of my betters, and I ask that
   every devout mind may help me with prayer, and that if any shall draw
   any edification from reading these writings, he may praise God for all
   His gifts and be grateful even for the least.

CHAPTER I

   Of the humility of Christ which Florentius studied to imitate

   (1)

   OUR Lord and Master Jesus Christ, the Flower of all virtue and of all
   knowledge, began in humility and meekness that rule of life which He
   handed down to His disciples to be observed as their law and pattern,
   saying: "Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall
   find rest for your souls."

   (2) That devout and humble priest of Christ, Master Florentius, the son
   of Radewin, followed after this virtue of true humility, which is the
   straightest path to the attainment of the Kingdom of Heaven. This path
   he kept to the very end of his life through many a spiritual contest,
   living most strictly in the continual mortification of the flesh, until
   he entered into the rest of everlasting bliss, to be rewarded by God
   for his dutiful and pious labours. But how he reached this path of
   humility I will tell, God helping me, in the following stages of my
   story. The Almighty and Merciful God, Who from all eternity had chosen
   him to be consecrated as His priest, and foreordained that he should be
   illuminated with the more excellent gifts; God, I say, of His
   marvellous goodness snatched him forth from the shipwreck of the world,
   and withdrew him therefrom; by the word of Truth He did effectually
   regenerate him, to lead an holier life and to be a branch yielding new
   fruit.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II

   Of the interpretation of the name Florentius and its three glorious
   meanings

   (1)

   VERILY the name "Florentius, son of Radewin," was a prophecy of his
   future righteousness, which should declare the glory of our Father in
   Heaven and make yet more bright the fame of his own kin. For herein is
   a laudable thing, if the life of a man be in accord with his name, and
   if his repute be consonant with his virtues: which thing is approved in
   every way by his upright deeds,

   Florentius is a name sweet for the righteous to utter and recall, for
   in his life he showed himself such that he was held in the greatest
   love and reverence by all men, both the Religious and those of the
   world.

   (2) Well is he named Florentius, as one that gathereth flowers (Flores
   legens) by reason of the liberal arts which once he learned and in
   which he was so skilled and proficient that he had the title of a
   Master thereof, as indeed he was--or again by reason of his knowledge
   of the divine law, and the books of sacred Theology, which he studied
   (legit) yet more gladly in preference to any other Science, and loved
   more dearly than all the treasures of the world, as saith the prophet
   in the Psalm, "Therefore have I loved Thy commandments above gold and
   topaz."

   But a far more lovely meaning is "One that holdeth flowers" (Flores
   tenens) because he followed Christ the Flower of all virtues and the
   Lover of Chastity, for Whose love Florentius despised the flowers of
   the world and held most firmly the integrity of the faith and the one
   law of Catholic peace, saying with the Bride in the Song of Songs, "My
   Beloved to me and I to him, who feedeth among the lilies. I held him
   and I will not let him go."

   (3) Moreover by a more sanctified interpretation and one more fruitful,
   he is called Florentius as one that gathereth flowers together (Flores
   colligens) because he gathered together with him in his house many
   clerks and brethren who were in the flower of their age; and these,
   despising the vanity of the world, served the Most High God with
   humility and devotion, in chastity of life and brotherly love, as the
   Holy David singeth with joyful voice: "Behold! how good and how
   pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity." These brethren
   Florentius ruled with such a discipline and taught with such fervency
   of spirit that his house was a school of heavenly training, having
   therein a mirror of holiness, a garniture of moral virtues, a pattern
   of goodness, a door to admit the poor, a place of meeting for clerks,
   of instruction for lay folk, of refuge for the devout, and for the
   beginning and carrying forward of every good thing. In this house many
   honourable and learned men first conceived the spirit of devotion, and
   like bees laden with honey went far afield from the full hive to spread
   fertility in divers places; and God giving them His blessing, the fruit
   of their labours was not small, so that one may justly say of them that
   thereby "the flowers have appeared in our land."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III

   Of the interpretation of his father's name Radewin

   (1)

   LET it not seem foolishness if the signification of his father's name
   be mystically interpreted, for this is thought to tend in no small
   degree to the honour of so great a man.

   Fitting enough, then, is the name of Radewin as meaning "The Divine
   Radiance," and by this name Christ is rightly signified, for He is the
   Brightness of the Father Who doth illumine the world with the light of
   His wisdom, with His spotless life, His true doctrine, His holy
   miracles, and His abundant revelation. He sent forth also His apostles
   like beams of the true Sun to preach His word in all the world and give
   a good example to all the faithful, saying to them: "So let your light
   shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your
   Father Who is in Heaven."

   (2) Therefore is Florentius well named the son of Radewin, for through
   Christ was he born again to a lively hope, by Him was he worthy to be
   irradiated and set on fire that he might despise earthly things and
   fervently love the things of Heaven. And if this name Radewin be
   translated from the Teutonic into the Latin tongue, "Rade" is
   "consilium" (that is "counsel"), and "win" is "vinum" (or "wine"), and
   these two words are excellently fitted to Florentius, who put aside the
   counsel of worldly wisdom and submitted himself to the commandments of
   the Law of God according to that saying of the Psalmist: "Thy
   testimonies are my meditation, and thy Justifications my counsel."

   In place of those vain and carnal delights which the world doth afford
   to them who love it, Christ gave to Florentius a taste of that inner
   sweetness which the world is not worthy to receive, and filled his
   heart and soul with the Wine of spiritual joy in the celebration of the
   Divine Mysteries, so that he glowed inwardly with the flame of the love
   of God and rejoiced with the voice of exultation saying with that most
   devout prophet: "My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living
   God." Then, too, concentrating all the powers within him, and being
   caught up in the Spirit above the body, he offered himself as a lively
   sacrifice, and one well pleasing unto God, and prayed faithfully with
   supplication for Holy Church and all Christian people.

   In this Sacred Feast he partook of that sweet draught which is poured
   forth from God Himself, and his soul being melted with love at the
   thought of God's infinite Bounty, with great giving of thanks he
   pondered upon these mystical words: "How great is the multitude of Thy
   sweetness, Lord, which Thou hast hidden for them that fear Thee!"

   Having told these things by way of preface, my pen turneth to his
   deeds.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV

   Of his native land, and bow be went to study at Prague

   (1)

   THIS revered father and devout priest of Christ, Master Florentius, was
   Vicar of Deventer, having been converted by the preaching of the
   venerable Gerard Groote, the grace of God working therewith. Having
   been his humble hearer, Florentius studied to imitate Gerard in all
   things, and receiving his wholesome counsels with gratitude, loved him
   as his dearest father, the begetter of his salvation, always and
   everywhere paying him the greatest reverence as was fitting. Therefore
   he deserved to be loved in turn by Gerard even more than were the other
   disciples, and to be commended above the rest for the special beauty
   and modesty of his character, for with these qualities he was eminently
   endowed and shone therewith in the Religious life.

   (2) He was born in the city of Leerdam, in the territory of the noble
   Count de Erkell; this city is situated near the boundary of Holland and
   about three miles from Utrecht. His father, Radewin, was well known by
   repute amongst those of his time; and being sufficiently endowed with
   goods and substance, considering the needs of his condition in life, he
   gave his fatherly consent and assistance to his son Florentius when the
   latter was setting forth to study at Prague. At this time the
   privileged University of Prague in Bohemia was in a most flourishing
   state, and many men went more eagerly thither from the Low Countries.
   He soon became a good scholar, for he was brilliant in understanding
   and eager to go forward in knowledge, and in like manner he was noted
   amongst the students for kindness to his intimates and reverence toward
   his teacher. Afterward he returned to his own country and his kindred,
   and having gained his Master's Degree was received with honour.

   (3) All his friends and neighbours rejoiced together exceedingly; for
   the pleasure of his presence, his health, and prosperity was rightfully
   a joy and consolation to them after his absence in lands so distant,
   and the perils through which God had suffered him to pass. But if his
   return in due time from the University of Prague, and his studies, gave
   great delight to his friends, yet since God ordained that something
   even better should follow, this return was the happy preparation for
   his eternal well-being, for after the lapse of no great while he became
   a true disciple of Christ instead of a Master of Arts. During his
   homeward journey from Prague our good Lord showed him a marvellous
   thing and one wherein His Mercy was clearly manifest; for when he had
   reached a deep valley a chariot followed behind him dashing down from
   the mountain with great speed; and as he could not turn aside from it,
   and was in fear of bodily peril, he threw himself upon the help of God,
   for there was no help from man. When he had called upon the Almighty,
   the immeasurable tenderness of our Saviour was present with him; for
   wonderful to relate, as soon as he had called upon the Lord, he saw
   that chariot in front of him upon the road on which he was travelling,
   and all danger was at an end. This whole matter he ascribed to a
   miracle wrought on his behalf by God Who healeth them that are troubled
   in heart, and doth free them that call upon Him from every strait.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V

   Of his honourable character in the world

   (1)

   HE was eminent for his honourable character, his cheerfulness amongst
   his comrades, his kindliness in word and generosity in spending. He was
   comely to look upon, of graceful figure and of moderate height. For a
   certain time God allowed him to mingle in the world, and learn by
   experience the deceitful madness thereof, but not to abide the hazard
   all the days of his life; so that no one whose desire was to be
   converted might despair of pardon, seeing that a change to better
   things had been wrought in this Florentius in so short a time.

   (2) It happened upon a time that he was invited with many others to a
   marriage, and when they were upon the way together, being most eager to
   pleasure his friends and to make merry with them, he did as follows for
   their gratification: cutting down green branches from the trees he took
   them and embowered those who sat in the carriage in suchwise as greatly
   to win their favour. For he knew not yet what the Lord should do
   concerning him, nor thought with what care he, in company with the
   devout Virgins, must inwardly adorn his conscience so as to be worthy
   to be called to an heavenly marriage; nor did he know of that celestial
   feast at the Marriage of Christ, wherefore he rejoiced to take part in
   earthly festivities. But through the Mercy of God he abode not long in
   this vanity, for receiving the blessed call, he attained to that mighty
   grace of devotion which surpasseth all worldly delight.

   (3) But this worldly act of his did foreshadow that good thing which
   should come to him, namely, that when by the grace of God he was
   converted into a spiritually minded man he should call many of his
   fellow guests to that marriage Feast among the citizens of Heaven,
   which the Immortal Bridegroom Jesus Christ doth celebrate with all the
   Saints for ever and ever. In after days this was most clearly made
   manifest by the many brethren whom he turned to the devout life, as I
   have seen evidently with mine own eyes, and as all Deventer doth know.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI

   Of his conversion through the preaching of Master Gerard

   (1)

   THE tender care of our Saviour was not lacking to succour this
   wandering lamb who was straying in great peril amid the mists of
   worldly fame. Therefore when the time for showing mercy to him was
   come, the Good Shepherd of Souls carefully withdrew the Sheep which He
   had dearly bought at the price of His own Blood from the snares that
   encompassed him, and pitifully led him into the Fold of that Holy Flock
   over which he should rule.

   When the venerable Master Gerard Groote was preaching the Gospel of
   Christ throughout the Diocese of Utrecht, many Clerks and lay folk,
   having heard the Word of God, deserted the vanities of the world, being
   anxious to avoid the punishment of Eternal fire, and by penitence and
   sorrow to gain the Kingdom of Heaven; for the voice of the Master as he
   preached was a living power which did so much the more prevail over the
   hearts of his hearers in that he himself was before all other men upon
   the path of virtue. So that his holy life showing itself in deeds gave
   confirmation to his words.

   (2) At that time, therefore, when Gerard was preaching to large
   congregations in the Church of S. Mary at Deventer, Master Florentius
   came also, eagerly listening for what he should say; and being
   outwardly instructed in wisdom through the light of this heavenly
   discourse, he was pricked to the heart, and soon became enlightened
   inwardly. For the great preacher was wont to turn his eyes from time to
   time upon those that stood by, and to frame his discourse with regard
   to the depth and extent thereof to suit the quality and need of his
   hearers, gauging these by the zeal which they displayed; just so do
   eager fishers spread their net most widely where they deem that most
   fishes have congregated.

   So it happened by the inspiration of God that Master Florentius, who
   was then endowed with all the grace of youth and sufficiently provided
   with all things necessary, gladly heard the Word of the Lord. He
   stopped not his ears nor turned aside from the music of that Heavenly
   Flute, but to his own profit he took to himself those words which
   proceeded forth from the mouth of the great preacher for the good of
   all and sundry. Therefore was he numbered amongst those Sheep of whom
   our Saviour said: "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they
   follow me."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII

   How he despised the life of the world and joined himself to Master
   Gerard

   (1)

   MASTER FLORENTIUS, therefore, being breathed upon by the Spirit of God
   and inwardly besprinkled with heavenly dew, suddenly withdrew his idle
   feet which he had at first planted upon the way of this present world.

   He prudently considered that to the short-lived gratification of the
   flesh there should surely succeed death the ruthless, and grief
   eternal. He resolved, therefore, to despise the deceitful honours of
   the world, and to his own exceeding gain thought good to follow the
   lowly life of Christ, that he might not lose his part in that home-land
   of the angels which is fair with flowers. Wishing then to converse more
   intimately with Master Gerard, whom he saw to be zealous toward all men
   for their soul's health, he delayed not to approach confidently his
   reverend presence, and to set in order before him his inmost thoughts;
   for he looked upon Gerard as the friend and steward of God.

   (2) When he came Gerard received him gladly, and opening a loving heart
   to Florentius held converse with him as he desired, being ready to
   reason with him of any matter concerning which he would inquire.

   Coming together they held sweet converse upon the things that pertain
   to salvation; the heart of each burned with an heavenly flame; the
   things of earth were of none account, but their good purpose to hold to
   the service of God was confirmed. For setting an holy life before them,
   and being zealous to keep citizenship in the country of the Lord, they
   were made thenceforward of one mind in the love of the Brotherhood. And
   the manifold grace of Christ was present with them so that they were
   profitable to salvation not only for themselves but also for their
   neighbours: for certain learned men and eloquent preachers were added
   to them, for their comfort and fuller joy and for the adornment of the
   House of our God. These burning fiercely with that flame which is the
   gift of the Holy Spirit, chose to walk closely in she footprints of
   Christ: to despise the world, to wage bold warfare against sin, and so
   to pass to eternal good.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII

   How Florentius himself, now fully converted, did convert many others

   (1)

   AND as that most soft South wind of the Love Divine breathed yet more
   constantly upon the garden of his heart, and watered it with tears, he
   began to be very fruitful in devotion, and to be moved with pious zeal
   to draw others from the defilements of sin. He therefore made it his
   care that in place of those whose worldly companionship he had formerly
   loved when occupied with profane study, he should now have Spiritual
   Brothers; for he desired that others also should be enkindled by that
   flame by which he himself was set on fire, and illumined by that light
   by which he was enlightened of God: and he was not backward in
   directing those who came to him both by words and the light of his
   example. Therefore he persuaded Clerks and lay folk who desire to serve
   God to flee from commerce with evil, to hasten to hear the Word of God,
   to follow after the lowliness of Christ, and to set the life of the
   Saints as the pattern before their eyes, seeing that through the grace
   of chastity and the observance of the precepts of the Lord they might
   gain an everlasting recompense.

   (2) Nor was that labour profitless which he expended to gain souls, but
   an abundant increase grew therefrom, for many young men and maidens,
   relying on his wholesome counsels, leaving parents and friends, began
   to walk in the paths of humility and devotion, and hating the life of
   the world to associate themselves together in Christ after the
   Apostolic manner; and they rejoiced with eager hearts to keep a Common
   table, and to have meagre sustenance. Lastly he exhorted them severally
   to go forward in the steps of virtue, to pray more often; to labour
   with their hands in due season; to be instant in reading holy books,
   and in earnest meditation; for by these one shall gain increase of
   fervour in devotion, and shall have that ever-present dread of the
   occasions of sin that doth guard a man, that he be not seduced of the
   devil through the idleness of his heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX

   Of the burdens that he bore, and the wrongs that he suffered

   (1)

   THAT old enemy of mankind, the Devil, perceiving these exercises in the
   spiritual warfare, was sorely hurt, and omitted not to persecute the
   devout Master, being jealous of this good beginning and of his pious
   deeds--for Satan feared that through the example and industrious
   preaching of Florentius the spoils of many souls would be taken from
   him; therefore he stirred up certain adversaries to impugn the simple
   life of this just man with harsh words and derision, as is the wont of
   such men to use, hoping to withdraw him from the good course which he
   had begun. But Florentius, being a man of gentle mind and well disposed
   to bear reproach for Christ's sake, was moved neither by evil report
   nor by the lies of them that would belittle him, for these things
   weighed lightly upon him as spider's webs, so that he continued
   constant in his good undertaking. He walked meekly among the perverse,
   and patiently amid slanderers, returning to no man evil for evil, but
   with a quiet heart he said his prayers, and either held his peace, or
   bridled the mouth of foolish men with some reasonable word. Fools
   railed against that which they did not comprehend, and one who walked
   humbly and avoided every vanity seemed to their froward understanding
   to be distraught.

   (2) But with modest aspect, like some flower of the field, Florentius
   went forth clad in a gray habit covered by a long cloak; and as some
   lily may grow among thorns and give forth her sweet odour when torn
   thereby, so was Florentius among his mockers; when derided he became
   yet more cheerful and made the sweet odour of his fame yet sweeter and
   more widely diffused by the patience which he showed. The Lord put upon
   him the breastplate of faith, and armed His warrior with the virtue of
   perseverance so that the wantonness of men might not prevail to
   overturn his stable mind, which the Grace of God had strengthened
   within him; for he was zealous to suffer shame and threatenings for the
   Name of Jesus, knowing that which is written; "Blessed are ye when men
   shall speak evil of you and reproach your name as evil for the Son of
   Man's Sake." Therefore he waited diligently upon the Author of Life,
   Jesus the Son of God, Whom the Pharisees called a Samaritan and a
   deceiver; Who warned His disciples beforehand that they must suffer
   much enmity from worldlings, for that He himself before them suffered
   yet more bitter things from the envious Jews. "For," saith He, "if they
   have persecuted Me, they shall also persecute you"; "The servant is not
   greater than his lord. If they have called the good man of the house
   Beelzebub, how much more them of his household?"

   By these holy words he was mightily comforted, and cared not for the
   mockings of men, nor turned aside from the true path of humility which
   the truth doth teach, but through his contempt of the world and
   self-denial he strove to climb to the very heights of virtue. He chose
   rather to be called an outcast Lollard with his Brothers, or to be
   thought a madman by worldlings, than to be reputed a great lord and
   master. Therefore so far as in him lay he put aside the honourable
   title of Master, and desired to be called by his name only, as did also
   the other Brothers, though some of these were sufficiently learned and
   sprung from the wealthier families in the world. He would have nothing
   costly or beautiful by way of apparel, he desired nothing delicate for
   his food, he allowed only those things necessary for use, but nothing
   superfluous; naught save those somewhat simple and unadorned things
   which tend to lowliness and are no offence to worldlings--for these
   latter are taught better by an example of lowliness than by subtle
   arguments. Therefore by following the Common Life, and showing
   brotherly love to all; by being not highminded but condescending to
   things of low estate, he was now esteemed as a loving father and not
   feared as an austere master; for the outward signs of an honest
   character and the inward virtue of heavenly purity were seen reflected
   in him as in the brightest mirror.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X

   Of his promotion to the priesthood and the abasement of his humility

   (1)

   BUT since the humble do deservedly gain repute, and just praise is
   befitting to the meek, they who formerly were used to oppose the man of
   God did withhold their tongues from their unjust enmity, for they saw
   the constancy of his mind, and that his resolve in the Lord was firm.

   Wherefore being converted to a dutiful regard for Florentius they began
   to commend the holiness of his life and to reverence him for the
   modesty of his garb and discipline, and also to love the devout zeal of
   his Brothers, which was founded upon the lowliness of Christ. And this
   indeed justly, for it was meet and right that one upon whom the Grace
   of God was poured out, making him blossom with many virtues, should be
   loved and extolled by all men. As the fame of his goodness increased,
   many clerks and lay folk came together in crowds to his house to hear
   the Word of God, and some of the Councillors and leaders of the State
   came to him for counsel, inasmuch as there was found in him the Wisdom
   of God, and in proportion to the greater virtue of his mind, a faith
   also greater than their own. Wherefore they heard him gladly and
   committed their consciences to him the more confidently in difficult
   and dark matters; and having listened to his words they did many good
   deeds that were pleasing to God.

   (2) So the humble Master, filled with Charity, rejoiced over this
   harvest of souls and the spiritual progress of his Brethren, and was
   very careful for the needs of poor clerks, paying reverence to Christ
   the Lord in them. But the venerable Master Gerard, seeing that his
   beloved disciple Florentius was adorned with special gifts of devotion,
   determined that he should be promoted to the Priesthood, being moved
   thereunto by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and urged by the
   prayers of many Brethren. But Florentius, protesting that he was
   unworthy of so great an honour, humbly sought to be relieved of this
   burden; yet he was overborne by the insistence of the Brethren, and at
   length not daring to resist the monitions of Gerard he gave that assent
   to which the duty of obedience compelled him. But when he became a
   Priest he was not puffed up with human pride but was found to be so
   much the more humble in every deed, and in his garb, in proportion as
   he became greater in dignity and rank. Master Gerard has borne this
   witness of him, saying: "Once only did I cause a man to be ordained to
   the priesthood and I believe that he is worthy. In future I will be
   cautious not to do such a thing lightly, for I perceive that few are
   fit for such a calling."

   Yet Florentius, as one that in his own eyes was truly small and of no
   worth, had no high thoughts of himself for his Ordination as a Priest;
   but in his heart he preferred the lower Brethren before himself, and
   spoke thus of a certain simple Clerk who was not yet admitted to the
   holy office: "Would that I could offer before the Judgement Seat of God
   the pen of that Clerk rather than the Chalice of my Priesthood."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XI

   How seldom be went out, and of his instructive demeanour as he stood in
   the Choir

   (1)

   BY his good and honourable character Florentius, the Lord's man, might
   easily be recognized by ignorant men and worldlings as one that was
   devout and the friend of God, and worthy to be the Vicar of Jesus
   Christ. At first therefore he was made Canon of St. Peter's Church in
   Utrecht, but resigning this prebend he accepted a Cure in Deventer,
   that he might be near Master Gerard and be instructed by his example
   and doctrine; wherefore he once said to a friend, "I hope that I shall
   not be a Canon all my life, but serve God in some lower station," and
   thus it came to pass to the eternal glory of God; for though he was
   held in great reverence for his holiness and abstinence, yet he utterly
   avoided honour from men, and for this cause refused to go out into
   public places and thought it his sole comfort to abide at home with his
   Brethren, for he knew that thereby he would make more progress himself
   and that his conduct would be an example of stability of purpose to
   others. And when he did go out into the streets he walked quickly,
   nowhere engaging in much talk; but saluting any acquaintance who met
   him with some brief word or an inclination of the head only; moreover,
   he paid so little heed to any outward manifestations of respect toward
   himself that often he did not notice those who met him, nor care to
   inquire whither they were going; but as he went to the Church he would
   pray or meditate of God as the Holy Spirit moved him.

   (2) But owing to his great bodily weakness and the oft infirmities
   which fell upon him by reason of his excessive abstinence in the first
   fervour of his devotion, he could not go daily into the Choir; yet on
   all great festivals, and on the anniversaries of Saints he rejoiced to
   attend Vespers so often as his health allowed, and to be present at
   High Mass. And though he was the senior Vicar in Deventer he always
   took his place on the left side of the Choir in the lower stall,
   although he was entitled to the highest seat next to the Canons. As he
   stood in the Choir he did not gaze about with wandering eyes, but stood
   very quietly turning towards the Altar, with all restraint and
   reverence. Being devoutly intent upon God and his own soul, he sang the
   Psalms so far as his weakness allowed in a low tone, observing the
   musical directions. He was so reverent and his aspect was so devout
   that many boys and chanters often gazed at him and admired his
   religious fervour, since no light-mindedness, for which he might be
   blamed, could be seen in any word or gesture. At that time I used to go
   into the Choir with the other scholars as I was ordered to do by Master
   John Boheme, who ruled the Scholars and Choristers strictly. And as
   often as I saw my Master Florentius standing there--though he did not
   look round--I was careful not to chatter, for I was awed by his
   presence because of the reverence of his posture.

   (3) Once on a time it happened when I was standing near him in the
   Choir that he turned to share our book for the chanting, and he,
   standing behind me, put his hands upon my shoulder--but I stood still,
   hardly daring to move, bewildered with gratification at so great an
   honour. There were then in the Chapter of Deventer divers Canons and
   Vicars who were learned and men of approved life, strict and eager to
   perform the Divine Offices with all due honour; these held Master
   Florentius, that man of God, in reverence and deserved esteem, and when
   he was present, the more anxiously restrained all extravagance and
   levity; and the whole Choir was enlightened by the instructive
   demeanour of this great priest.

CHAPTER XII

   Of the simplicity of his garb

   (1)

   THE good Florentius, being a lover of simplicity and lowliness, knew
   that an ornate attire doth not make the Priest, but rather lowliness of
   heart and righteousness of character, and therefore put away from him
   all adornment in attire and everything that pertained to the pomps of
   the world and ostentation before men, so as to preserve the better his
   purity of conscience. So after that he was made a priest he sought not
   softer clothing as being more appropriate to himself than to others,
   but was contented with the Common and simple garb like the rest of the
   Brothers, and this he did that the outer garb might answer to the inner
   man. For having God ever before his eyes, he did not love that
   adornment and care for the body which passeth away, but kept his eye
   open to see the virtues of the soul.

   (2) Yet he was careful not to give the least occasion of offence to the
   weak, either by his garb, or by anything that is a necessity of nature,
   choosing according to Christ's example that which is more proper to
   lowliness and in less esteem amongst men. Therefore he did not wear one
   garment on festivals and another on ordinary days, but only a more
   highly ornamented vestment at the Celebration of Mass on Feast Days for
   his reverence to the Sacrament, and in this he kept within the bounds
   of due decency.

   The almuce that he wore was somewhat old and faded, and was in many
   places moth-eaten and threadbare. When I saw him come across to the
   Choir in such a garment I was grieved that a priest so good and
   honourable should go about in such mean and lowly garments. He did not
   wear elegant sandals like other Vicars in the Church, but in place
   thereof low and coarse wooden shoes, soled with old leather, which made
   no clatter as he entered the Choir. His cloak and robe were of grey
   cloth, for though his uncle who loved him had given him a new robe, he
   would not wear it because it seemed too honourable, and he ever
   preferred simple things to costly. His hood was black, or dark in
   colour, and so worn as to cover both shoulders and the bare part of the
   neck, for so it was made for him. He wore scanty sleeves tied back with
   but few strings, the hinder parts were patched from time to time with
   new cloth as they wore through with age, for this humble priest of God
   did not blush to wear an ancient garment patched by the tailor, and
   indeed he and all his Brothers contended in holy rivalry which should
   wear the meaner garments, and each strove to surpass the other in this
   regard.

   (3) On one occasion, when a Secular Priest was present, Florentius was
   discoursing devoutly of God, and his hearer standing near him was
   busied with the beautiful and curiously embroidered sleeves which he
   wore, turning his hands now in this direction now in that and
   Florentius looking kindly at him said: "My brother, see what sort of
   sleeves I wear, they do not occupy my mind nor disquiet me. To wear
   such long ones as thou dost would be a weariness and a burden to me."
   Hearing this, and blushing somewhat, the other stood more quietly and
   taking the saying in good part, went away edified, being instructed in
   simplicity of attire by the example of Florentius.

   (4) At another time he called to him the tailor who was to make him a
   new cloak, and said: "Sir, do you know how to make a mean garment?" and
   he answered: "I know not that I can do so, but tell me, Sir, what sort
   of garment thou dost desire?" Then said the humble Master Florentius to
   the tailor: "Make of that cloth four parts, and sew them together
   without folds that I may put on or take off the garment easily; so made
   it will be good enough for me." To this the tailor wondering much
   replied: "O my beloved Master, how can this be? How can I wilfully
   destroy a good piece of cloth? I will make it well as is more
   suitable." Then said the meek and lowly priest: "Why should one take
   care for the adorning of the outward man? For the love of God make it
   in the simplest way thou canst; for so is it more pleasing to me; since
   it is fitting that I should have simple garments for the edification of
   others."

   O noble Priest of Christ! who wert ever inclined to lowliness, who the
   better to please God didst put away all delicate living from thee!

CHAPTER XIII

   Of his humble service among the Brothers

   (1)

   CHRIST, the Light of the World, came into the world to enlighten the
   minds of the faithful by preaching the Word of Heavenly Life, and it
   was chiefly by the example of His humility that He did kindle the
   sullen hearts of sinners to love His Name; and He left this example as
   a pattern to all the faithful throughout the earth. For Christ so bore
   Himself among His disciples as if He were one of them, showing them the
   ministry of love and not exercising the lordship of power, so that if
   any is willing to imitate Him, the same is worthy to be honoured by
   Him, and to be made a ruler of all good things in the Kingdom of
   Heaven: for He saith: "I am in the midst of you as He that serveth,"
   and again: "The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto but to
   minister and to give His life to many." This rule of holy servitude
   Florentius that humble servant of Christ was zealous to follow with the
   Brothers, persuading all that clave to him of whatever age they might
   be to take their turn of servile work in love and in turn to bear the
   common burden, to shrink from no menial task, but gladly to occupy
   themselves with humble service, embracing the more eagerly those tasks
   which are deemed less honourable and are harder and more toilsome.

   (2) So there grew up amongst them this holy custom, and approved
   virtue, that every one of the Brothers should do service for a week in
   the kitchen, and should there cook with all humility, or promptly and
   cheerfully fulfill the injunctions of the cook. For at that time all
   were ardent to perform the less honourable tasks, inasmuch as to labour
   with their hands for the Kingdom of God was thought to be a pleasant
   recreation. So Florentius, the good Father and kindly Master, wishing
   to set a good example before those whom he ruled, himself took his turn
   in the kitchen as far as he could, and when a neighbour, moved by
   compassion, said to him: "Why, good Sir, dost them occupy thyself in
   the kitchen? Hast thou none that can do this for thee? Would it not be
   better that thou shouldest go to the Church, and another cook for
   thee?" the humble servant of Christ answered: "Should I not rather
   strive for this to gain the prayers of all the other Brothers rather
   than my own prayers alone. For during the time that I am in the kitchen
   all the others are constrained to pray for me? I hope therefore to gain
   a greater blessing from the prayers of those that are in the Church
   than I could if I alone were praying."

   Thus he edified them all both by example and precept, seeking not what
   was pleasant to himself, but what was useful to others and a good
   example. Whenever he took his meals with the Brothers he placed the
   first dish upon the table with his own hands; and he grieved much
   because through the hindrance of his infirmity he was not able to take
   his place every day at the Common table of the Brotherhood. For this
   cause he used to eat in the kitchen alone with the cook, having a small
   table meanly served, because the weakness of his stomach suffered him
   not to take solid food. I myself, unworthy as I am, often made ready
   his table at his request, and brought from the buttery that modest
   draught which he desired, and I gladly served him with much
   cheerfulness of spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIV

   How he laboured with his hands for the common good

   (1)

   FLORENTIUS, who excelled all others in his character, and is worthy to
   be remembered as being- among these devout men the most devout of all,
   never wished to be found in idleness, but strove to expend his precious
   time in some fruitful work, being careful above all things--although he
   was the holder of a benefice--not to eat his bread for naught and
   without working therefor. And what he learned and received from Master
   Gerard, this he carefully observed; for it was the Master's opinion
   that none should be admitted to the Community save he who was
   willing--according to the saying of St. Paul--to labour with his hands.
   For this is an holy occupation and one most profitable to all spiritual
   progress; hereby are the lusts of the flesh tamed, and the mind is the
   more readily bridled, being distracted from idle wanderings. By such
   work is hurtful indolence taken away, and thus we more easily avoid
   those foolish babblings which through such indolence do arise. And when
   the opportunity for chattering is taken from us, the work doth go
   forward under our hand, and he will ever be more fruitful in good who
   shall have been a faithful labourer. By this also is a wise provision
   made for the necessities of the Brothers, and the miseries of the poor
   are more freely relieved, for Almsgiving from those gains that are won
   in the sweat of the face are the more pleasing in the sight of God and
   more spotless, and the profit of honest labour doth relieve the
   indigent. For this reason the art of copying books was eagerly taken up
   by the brethren of his house in the earlier days, for this is more
   convenient for clerks than other work, and can be pursued more quietly,
   and it was introduced as their customary occupation for the common
   good. The venerable Father Florentius himself set a bright example
   before the copyists that his title as their superior might not seem an
   empty one, and that he might enhance his priestly office by being a
   pattern of industry; wherefore he busied himself with smoothing the
   parchment and ruling and arranging the pages. For though he was less
   skilful as a copyist, yet with his own hand--though consecrated with
   the holy oil--he gave great help to the other writers by preparing all
   things necessary for their use.

   (2) Occasionally, as opportunity arose and time .permitted, he with a
   chosen companion would read and correct the books already written, or
   compile Sacred extracts from Holy Scripture for the consolation of the
   Brothers, or as exercises for others of the household; for he delighted
   and greatly rejoiced when he could spend his day in doing some good for
   the Community, knowing that this would be most pleasing to God. But
   owing to the multitude of clerks who came together to him when the fame
   of his goodness was noised further abroad his help was demanded by many
   persons outside the Brotherhood, both religious and learned men.
   Wherefore in the interest of the salvation of souls, it was fitting for
   him to engage himself upon higher matters, and often to abstain from
   his own personal affairs or from private study, and to prefer Spiritual
   gain before temporal advantages.

   (3) Sometimes so many stood before his cell desiring to speak with and
   consult him, or to confess their secrets to a man so holy, that there
   was scarcely room for him to come forth, and he had barely time to
   spare for reciting the Hours and attending duly to the needs of the
   body; yet he left none uncomforted, but either settled the matter out
   of hand, or, if his petitioner desired it left him free to return to
   him on a future occasion. It happened sometimes that he began to recite
   the Hours, but could not finish the Psalm which he had begun because so
   many came to him one after the other; and that he might not yield to
   weariness and refuse to open the door to him that knocked, he said to
   himself, "Once more for the sake of God," and this "once more" he did
   often repeat till "once" became "often," for in his brotherly love he
   did patiently overcome the hardships and unrestfulness of these
   interruptions.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XV

   Of his compassion toward the poor, the sick, and the friendless

   (1)

   AMONGST other works of piety the virtue of compassion did especially
   grow and flourish in the heart of the good Father, a virtue which he
   showed and exercised by the frequent distribution of alms to the poor
   and to strangers; wherefore in justice one ought to say of him as is
   said of the righteous man in the Psalm: "He hath distributed, he hath
   given to the poor, his justice remaineth for ever," for indeed he was a
   most loving father to the poor, a most kindly comforter to those in
   distress, and a most compassionate visitor of the sick. Being filled
   with the Spirit of God, he had the milk of compassion, and the wine of
   zeal and fervour, and did nurture the weak with the oil of Mercy; while
   he hated their evil passions and sins, yet he did display his
   detestation thereof and his mercy each in due season and with great
   discretion.

   (2) He often sent meats that were for his own table to the sick and
   needy, and the herbs which were sent to him in charity, he with a
   charity still greater would share with others that did lack. He kept
   the names of the poor written down, and committed the care of them to
   one or two of the Brothers, bidding them provide for their honourable
   entertainment and the expenses of their maintenance. There were at that
   time certain honourable persons in the town of Deventer who feared God,
   men of good conversation who followed the counsels of Florentius, and
   certain Matrons wealthy and devout who were given up to charitable
   deeds, attending the Church of God regularly and honouring His priests.
   These ministered to God's poor clerks with much kindness, and at the
   request and instance of Florentius did most willingly serve them. So
   good and beloved was the humble vicar of Christ in the eyes of all that
   if he made a petition on behalf of any poor man, he soon obtained his
   request. He showed himself affable to the friendless and to strangers
   as if they were his friends and kinsmen, asking whence they came, and
   how they were called, begging them to come sometimes to visit him.

   (3) This notable lover of Chastity hid not the light of his benevolence
   from the little ones, and the young who were striving after innocence
   of life and purity, but with pious words taught them to love Jesus and
   Mary, exhorting them to preserve their innocence, that being made like
   to the angels of God they might sing the Song of the Virgins in Heaven.
   To the sad and tempted he was cheerful and comfortable, so that if any
   were troubled or offended, the sight of Florentius, and a few words
   from him, would give such an one peace and consolation and he would
   return joyfully to his own business. This I have often tried in mine
   own person, as have my comrades in devotion, for we were instructed by
   his counsel and taught in the School of Christ by his excellent
   discourses. He did not shrink from lepers or others who were marred by
   any bodily deformity, but rather took care to show himself more kindly
   than usual to such outcasts, knowing that this was more pleasing to the
   Creator, and would gain greater glory for himself, because he thought
   upon the bond of Nature, and the image of God in man rather than the
   vileness of the person.

   (4) I have seen one blind of an eye, and another lame of one foot, who
   were converted by him, and afterward became men of approved life. I
   knew also a leper who abode outside the city walls who in the grace of
   devotion came near to God's priest, and spoke with him as a friend; and
   many saw this and wondered at the humility of the Master in sitting by
   a leper. He also commanded that a draught of wine and a special dole
   should be given to the man, and after speaking many words of holy
   comfort to him he let him go away to his own abode with his companion.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVI

   Of his feeding the poor, and washing beggars

   (1)

   BUT because as Holy Scripture teacheth, God loveth a cheerful giver, it
   is pleasant to tell further of the great compassion shown by this most
   charitable father--Florentius--toward the poor and those that were full
   of sores, the maimed, and such as had no friends to comfort them.
   Besides the alms that were applied daily to pious purposes in relieving
   mendicants, Florentius, this most pitiful father of the indigent, used
   to invite to his table twelve poor scholars every year, on the Feast of
   S. Gregory the Pope, in honour of that Saint, because he had read how
   Gregory himself used to entertain twelve poor men every day. I myself
   also by his direction brought to his house at dinner time certain poor
   persons whom he named to me, and these being refreshed with food and
   drink returned with joyful hearts to their Schools and rendered thanks
   to God for the benefits they had received, and expressed deep
   thankfulness to Florentius and his Brotherhood for their abundant
   hospitality. Then was most clearly fulfilled that saying of the
   Psalmist, which is changed as a Grace before meat by many Religious
   orders: "The poor shall eat and be filled, they shall praise the Lord
   that seek Him, their hearts shall live for ever and ever."

   (2) So too, in the month of May, the Season when the wild herbs that
   are used as medicaments have their highest virtue, the good Father did
   not forget his poor; knowing that many were weak, ulcerous, and full of
   sores, he made them to come to his house upon an appointed day and hour
   to receive certain medicines, and to have their bodies bathed in warm
   water infused with aromatic herbs. And when they had been throughly
   bathed and washed he made ready for each a most cleanly bed for
   sudorific treatment. And after receiving a cup of wine, and some words
   of comfort, they went away with great joy to their own homes, saying
   one to the other, "How good and loving a man is this Lord Florentius!
   and how good are the Brethren who dwell with him! in that they give us
   such things for the Sake of God without money and without price!"

   (3) Once about the Season of Lent, at a time of scarcity, when poor
   mendicants were borne down by want, many fled for refuge to the
   tenderhearted Father imploring comfort from him, hoping to find some
   relief, for no one ever came away from him empty or uncomforted. In
   this distressful time Florentius, the Father of pity, was filled with
   sympathy for the pain of those that suffered hunger, and for the devout
   poor, taking counsel with the Brothers as to the best way of succouring
   the needy who were in such straits that they had neither money in their
   purse, nor bread in their scrip. Then were the Brothers one and all
   fired with, desire to help these multitudes of poor, especially at this
   Holy Season of Lent, which is observed as a time of Penance at which
   one ought to expend larger sums in Charity upon the needy who with many
   prayers ask for bread in the Name of God--as saith the Prophet Esias:
   "Deal thy bread to the hungry and bring the needy and the harbourless
   into thy house; when thou shalt see one naked, cover him, and despise
   not thine own flesh." Therefore the Brothers did firmly determine to
   deny themselves somewhat and to contribute more largely to the poor,
   and for their sake add one hour of daily work to the usual period of
   labour throughout the Season of Quadragesima: and to hand the whole
   that they might gain by their copying in that hour to the Overseer of
   the poor, that therewith he might buy them the necessary victual and
   faithfully minister to them. The same was done by certain Brethren that
   were copyists and writers in other Religious Houses who of their own
   labour offered a sacrifice of alms to God, chastening themselves of
   their own will and refreshing the poor in all gladness.

   (4) Who can worthily unfold all the pitiful acts of this most blessed
   Father toward the poor and strangers, but particularly toward the
   simple and them that are of the devout Household of Christ? But though
   all should be silent yet will I not hold my peace, but will continually
   sing of the compassions of Florentius, for by mine own experience did I
   prove the multitude of his mercies surely and without doubt during
   seven years of his life. Like the blessed Job indeed "He was feet to
   the lame, and eyes was he to the blind, an hand to the needy, a staff
   to the feeble, a comfort to the fallen, a cloak to him that was
   scantily clad." One did rejoice for the alms that were given him,
   another for the coat that was made for him, one would take away a
   cloak, another a hat, another shoes, another boots j another would
   receive a girdle and hosen, another books; another would rejoice that
   he had asked and received pens, ink, and paper. Thus each one rejoicing
   in his own gift would confess that from this honourable Lord
   Florentius, the father of the orphan and the needy, he had received not
   goods for the use of the body only, but also a medicine for his soul.
   My weak tongue doth not suffice to tell fully of his virtues and
   charitable deeds, for his conversation and that of his brethren doth
   surpass the reckoning of man. It is just that I should not fear to say
   of them what is written of the Apostolic Saints: "They are men of mercy
   and their just deeds have not been forgotten. Their good works remain
   with their posterity, and all the Church of the Saints shall tell of
   their almsgiving."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVII

   Of his abstinence and the infirmities which came upon him by reason of
   his austerity

   (1)

   THIS fervent and devout servant of God did chastise his body too
   rigorously with fast and watching when first he was converted; in the
   endeavour to restrain the concupiscence of the flesh, he did not
   consider with due care the weakness of his nature, but in the fervour
   of his spirit did so persecute the enemy within him, that by the weight
   of his austerity he did also overthrow one that had heretofore dwelt
   within him in friendship and loyalty. For he not only abstained from
   what was unlawful and superfluous, but also denied himself things
   necessary, so that he lost all appetite for food, and had no taste for
   the discerning of meats. Wherefore it once happened that in the absence
   of the cook he went into the buttery and drank oil out of a jar
   mistaking it for beer; nor did he know the difference until the cook
   asked him from which of the jars he had drunk, and then he knew of his
   mistake. At another time, at a certain Monastery, a draught of wine was
   brought him to drink by reason of his weakness and because of the
   loving care which the Brothers had for him, and when he had tasted
   thereof he said to one that stood by, "How sharp and bitter ye make
   your beer"; and the Brothers marvelled that he knew not the taste of
   wine from that of any other liquor. Therefore he took his victual for
   the more part as if he did not taste it, and rather because Nature
   compelled him to eat than because appetite or the flavour of any meat
   attracted him.

   (2) Sometimes I went to visit him in his cell, where he sat upon his
   couch in bodily weakness, and I spoke to him with sympathy, being much
   grieved for his sickness. And once Brother James of Viana, who at that
   time ministered to him, brought him a strengthening decoction of herbs,
   saying, "These are good herbs; I pray thee take thereof, are they not
   pleasant to the taste?" Then I heard Florentius answer, "A crust of
   bread would be more savoury to you than this is to me." But although he
   was very weak and was compassed about by many infirmities of the body,
   yet did he not cease from the work of God and from gathering an holy
   harvest of souls. When he was strong enough to admit them to come to
   him he gave to those that sought him the counsels of salvation with
   renewed fervour. And these became the sweeter to his hearers as they
   were more and more assured that Florentius was beloved of God and was
   being tried by various bodily infirmities, as the precious gold is
   tried in the fire.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XVIII

   How he often recovered by the aid of the prayers of the devout

   WH1LE he suffered continually in the flesh yet was he instant in
   rendering thanks to God with all diligence, because the sufferings of
   this present time are not worthy to be compared with the gaining of the
   glory of God to come. And he bore with patience the rod of the Lord
   "that was uplifted against him, as an wholesome discipline for his
   soul," bethinking him that this was a sign of love, as the Apostle
   saith, "Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
   whom He receiveth." Our good Lord, desiring to show how greatly the
   tried virtue of His sons doth please Him, and how the prayers of the
   righteous do avail much, showed mercy toward His beloved priest, who
   was often brought to the very extremity of weakness, though the
   physicians thought that there was no hope of saving his life by any
   human means. Florentius himself put all his hope in the Lord, Who with
   His saving grace doth raise up the deserving. So often therefore as
   perilous sickness did assail him he was commended to the fervent daily
   prayers of the neighbouring Religious Communities of Brothers, Clerks,
   and Nuns, that they might implore God to spare him yet a little, and
   save his life for the weal of many; and that the devout might not
   suffer sorrow upon sorrow as they must if they were bereft of a Father
   so beloved and a director so necessary to them.

   (2) I myself sometimes was the messenger on such an occasion, and said
   to the Nuns, "Pray for our lord Florentius, for his sickness is heavy
   upon him." And behold, the merciful God, who despiseth not the prayer
   of the poor, but doth readily hear the vows of the humble, restored his
   beloved and faithful servant to health, "to make known His power to the
   sons of men."

   (3) In those days there was one renowned for his knowledge of medicine,
   named Everard Eza, Curate of Almelo, a man of much skill and repute
   amongst the doctors of medicine; this man, being inspired by the grace
   of the Religious Life, became the familiar friend of Florentius and his
   Brothers, and others who were vowed to Christ; he was wont to come
   often to Florentius, and to give him freely the relief that his art
   afforded; and the Brothers loved him much and received him with
   reverence. He showed great diligence to heal his beloved friend, and
   was often very helpful to him; also he relieved the sadness of the
   Brothers, and consoled them by his confidence that there was hope that
   the life of Florentius would be saved, saying to them, "I do put my
   faith in God rather than in the art of medicine, considering this
   namely, that it doth surpass human strength for one to have lived so
   long with such a weakly body, and unless the special grace of God were
   preserving him, and the prayers of many were being offered for him, he
   would immediately die, or rather he would have been dead long since. It
   is good, therefore, to pray faithfully for him, for the saving of his
   life doth depend particularly upon the Grace of God."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIX

   How upon an Easter Even he was healed by a Vision of Angels

   (1)

   HIS sickness came upon him more grievously and oftener during the
   season of Lent than at other times in the year because the Lenten fare
   was somewhat trying and ill to digest; but though at this season his
   bodily weakness was greater yet he offered himself to keep the fast
   with a mind even more cheerful than usual; once his strength so drooped
   owing to his abstaining almost entirely from food--and the consequent
   weakness of his stomach--that there was scarcely a hope that he could
   live till Easter. But the devout prayers of the Brothers cried without
   ceasing to God for him, and they implored that answering Grace Which
   they had often known before. At that time all human aid was failing and
   they had recourse to the power of God, that mightiest source of
   comfort.

   (2) So when the fast was over and the glorious Festival of the Lord's
   Resurrection was at hand, this chosen man of God was resting on his bed
   steeped in a sweet sleep; and behold! on this most holy Paschal night
   he was thought worthy to receive the comfort and consolation of an
   Angelic vision. He saw two angels appear before him, one standing upon
   the right side of his bed and the other upon the left; one lifted up
   his hand and brandished a sword over the head of the sleeper, as if in
   act to strike, but the other stayed the blow, and forbade him, saying,
   "Smite him not, for his life shall yet be whole within him and he shall
   not die." Amazed at this vision sent from heaven, Florentius awoke,
   raised as it were from death to life and wondrously comforted in the
   Lord; calling his servant--who was sleeping in the cell near at
   hand--he said, in a confident voice, "Arise, and prepare me something
   to eat to-day; I feel that I am mending, and we must keep feast in the
   Lord together!" Then the servant, filled with great joy, hasted to do
   as Florentius commanded, and all who heard thereof were filled with
   amazement and joy that he who they had lately feared must die had begun
   so quickly to amend.

   (3) This vision he afterward told to his uncle, the Canon of St. Mary's
   Church in Utrecht, who loved him with all his heart. He did not name
   himself, but told how it was revealed to a certain man that he should
   live awhile longer. Upon this his uncle did congratulate him greatly,
   and blessed God who had sent His Angel and saved Florentius from the
   destruction of death.

   The illustrious Florentius lived for several years after this, to the
   comfort of all devout persons, both clerks and lay folk, who came to
   him from divers parts and countries for the healing of their souls: for
   this man of God and the Community of Brothers, who were gathered
   together in his house, became by their precept and example leaders in
   holy conversation to such devout persons, to the Glory of God Almighty.

CHAPTER XX

   Of one who fell into a well and was drawn out unhurt

   IT happened upon a time that many came together to the ancient house of
   the beloved Father Florentius to hear the Word of God, and while he was
   discoursing to them with holy exhortation, a certain man who was
   sitting with others on the edge of a well was overcome with sleep and
   fell back headlong into the water. All who were present were terrified
   by his fall and looked down into the well lamenting the mischance--and
   behold! by the protection of God the man stood safe and unhurt upon his
   feet in the water of the well, to the wonder of all. And hastily
   seizing a pole which hung above they let it down through the well's
   mouth and drew forth alive the man who, as they had thought, was almost
   drowned and dead. Seeing him freed from so great danger they rendered
   thanks to God Almighty, and were not a little comforted in that He had
   not allowed one to suffer sudden death in that house.

   (2) This was told me by a citizen of Kempen who was present at the time
   and as a youth had been often in Deventer; he also told me many good
   things of this man of God and his Brotherhood. I have often drawn water
   for use in the kitchen out of this same well, which is somewhat narrow,
   and therefore the thing that was done doth tend yet more strongly to
   the Glory of God, who is present to save lives from danger, beyond all
   that we ask of Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXI

   Of the vision of the Rood which appeared over his house

   THIS Community of Brothers dwelling in the house of Florentius was
   wholly pleasing to God and beloved of Him, and being gathered together
   to His praise was refulgent with virtue and adorned with lofty and
   meritorious deeds. Lowliness, which therein was the chief of all
   virtues, was sought after by all from the lowest to the highest; and
   did make a Paradise of this earthly house, transforming mortal men into
   heavenly pearls to be as living stones meet for glory in the temple of
   God.

   (2) Here under the strict discipline of the Rule, obedience, the mother
   of virtue, and the lamp of discernment, so flourished, that to obey
   without hesitation became the highest wisdom, and for one to neglect
   the counsel or lightest word of his Superior would have been a deed of
   horror and disgrace.

   Here the inward manifestations of love, that is for God, and its
   outward manifestation, that is charity to one's neighbour, burned with
   so hot a flame that the hard hearts of sinners who heard the holy
   discourses of the Brothers were melted to tears, and they that had come
   thither cold at heart, being there kindled by the fire of the Word,
   went away rejoicing, heedful to sin no more. Here the armour of
   spiritual warfare was kept bright for use against the several sins of
   man, and old and young alike did learn to fight bravely against the
   devil, their own flesh, and the deceits of the world. Here the memory
   of the ancient Fathers, and the pattern of the holy conversation of the
   monks of Egypt--which had lain as it were half dead upon the
   earth--were restored to life; and the manner of life of the clergy rose
   to that standard of the highest perfection which was set by the
   practice of the Primitive Church.

   Here were heard devout exhortations to the spiritual warfare. Here amid
   their daily meditations the Brothers did full often dwell upon that
   most holy and sorrowful Passion of our Saviour Jesus Christ in loving
   recollection, and ruminate thereupon; because to recall that Passion
   and to dwell upon It doth surely conduce to the soul's health, doth
   avail to cure the deadly bite of the serpent, to calm the tempests of
   passion in the heart, and to uplift the dullard mind from things of
   earth to things of Heaven through the imitation of the Crucified Lord.

   (3) And because the ardour of their devout thanksgiving, and their
   remembrance of the benefits that God had bestowed upon them leaped up
   as a flame in the hearts of many; and because this holy Community was
   ever making progress to still better things, being instructed by the
   example of the revered father Florentius utterly to despise the world;
   therefore the good God Who giveth His blessing and grace to the humble,
   failed not to cherish His faithful servants by giving to them holy
   comfort and inward joy. Bringing forward one instance out of many I
   will add here in a few words the story of a marvellous sight, which God
   Who knoweth all hidden things thought good to show above that house
   which He had consecrated with unction from on high.

   (4) There was a devout disciple of Florentius, a young branch of his
   planting, who was startled by a strange vision in the night, and at
   first was altogether afraid, but afterward was made joyful by the
   wondrous and divine power of God. For as he lay upon his pallet, a
   mighty wind arose from the north, and there came a fierce tempest
   shaking all the earth as if the day of the Last Judgement were at hand,
   that day which all flesh must fear. Terror-stricken at this dreadful
   tempest the young man began to think how he should flee, and whither
   turn aside from the face of the wrath of God; but being caught in a
   strait place he looked upward to Heaven, and lo! there was seen clearly
   in the sky the sign of the Cross bearing the Figure of Christ, the
   Author of our Salvation. And as he gazed upon this holy Figure of the
   Crucified, pendent in the air with hands outstretched and pierced with
   the nails, the glory of Whose Presence doth lighten all the world, the
   tempest ceased. And the Rood moved onward until It stood over the house
   of Florentius where dwelt those that truly despised the world, the
   servants of the Holy Cross, at Whose coming and before Whose Presence
   the whole house was lifted from its foundations as if to meet the
   Saviour, and nowhere touched the ground; and after bending reverently
   towards the Cross it returned again to its former stable position; but
   the Image of the Cross went onward and stood above the wall over
   against the door of the house through which the Brothers went forth day
   by day. Seeing these things the young man spread forth his hands toward
   the Cross and began to pray and implore to be protected from the fear
   of the dread Judgement, and straightway he was caught up from where he
   lay and placed within the door of Florentius' house as if in a place of
   safety beneath the Wings of the Crucified. Then being overjoyed and, as
   it were, safe from every danger, he awoke in unspeakable gladness, and,
   wondering greatly, returned thanks to God who had thought good to give
   him such a revelation concerning the holy Brotherhood to which he was
   zealously from thenceforth to cleave, and continually to reverence the
   life thereof which was hid with Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXII

   Of his patience, gentleness, and love toward all men

   (1)

   A CERTAIN Senator, who relied upon his own worldly cunning, was not
   afraid to trouble Master Florentius, this man of God, but shamelessly
   strove to deprive him of his benefice, thinking perchance that no one
   would oppose him, or answer on behalf of Christ's vicar, who seemed to
   be devout and meek towards them that did him hurt. But when the cause
   came on and Florentius should have answered his adversary as to the
   plaint against him, the Master made use of no wordy argument or
   eloquent pleading, but replied shortly and humbly after this manner:
   "If ye have a better right than I, in the Name of God maintain it." And
   they that stood by wondered, and were edified at his words.

   (2) But one of the canons, a man zealous for God, who would not suffer
   the just and innocent to be oppressed, said to him, "Beloved Master,
   why dost thou speak thus? Hast thou so little care to keep thy
   benefice? Yet shall not the enemy gain that which he seeketh, but we on
   thy behalf will look to it that thou keep that which thou dost
   rightfully possess." The adversary hearing these words was silent, and
   departed, having gained nothing, for indeed all men knew, both high and
   low alike, that the devout Master was a worthy Priest of Christ, and
   one whose life and doctrine had led many to despise the world. For he
   had made them that were aforetime great and worldly-wise to become
   lowly and simple-minded brothers, and some that were sufficiently
   instructed for the devout life and the dignity of the Priesthood, he
   had made able ministers therein as the sevenfold grace of the Holy
   Ghost increased in them.

   (3) But he thought it his greatest gain and chiefest joy to have shown
   to any the way of eternal salvation, and to have recalled them from
   sinfulness to continence; for these things he was reverenced by men of
   the world, honoured by the great, and most tenderly loved by the good
   and the devout; his earnest life, his love of God, made perfect; his
   dutifulness to his neighbour, his bounty toward the poor, his honesty
   to his fellows, his kindliness to the afflicted made him to be so
   beloved of all. Wherefore one said of him: "There is no Monk whom I
   love and respect so much as Florentius; I look upon him as upon an
   Angel of God." He, however, took no pleasure in his own reputation, but
   rather in the conversion of men and the progress of the Brotherhood,
   whose numbers were increased daily, for in his time the Lord bestowed
   His Grace without stint upon them. For this cause his name, which was
   in great esteem, and the good report of his reputation reached even to
   strange cities, and men both in Deventer and afar off praised and
   commended him greatly. Yet he thought not of the praise that men gave
   him, nor weighed it at all; yea rather he held it worthless and derided
   it, for having cast his eye upon certain laudatory letters that were
   sent him he threw them behind a chest, saying, "Is this all of which
   they have to write? Good were it if they had said nothing on such a
   matter."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIII

   Of his devout exhortation to spiritual prayer

   (1)

   MASTER FLORENTIUS, that notable fair flower of the priesthood, that
   fervid zealot for souls, not only took thought for the Brothers of his
   house, but was also instant in planting the seeds of the Word of
   Salvation amongst other neighbouring Communities of Clerks and from
   time to time communed with them and piously exhorted them to have peace
   and charity towards one another, either preaching himself or sending
   some suitable Brother of his house. When he visited them all the
   inmates rejoiced, desiring to hear the Holy Word from the mouth of
   God's Priest, for the Holy Ghost spoke through his mouth to comfort
   that little Flock which was eagerly and devoutly willing to obey.

   (2) In one of his discourses he spake this word of advice. "Every man
   should set before him daily these resolutions, namely, to earnestly
   strive to amend his life: to struggle anew against his temptations; to
   pluck out his vices, to strive with special courage to overcome those
   sins which do more easily beset him; to do violence to himself for
   Christ's sake because the Kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the
   violent bear it away.'" It is profitable also for a man to lay his
   passions and perplexities bare before some discreet brother, one who
   hath tried knowledge of the Way of God. It is well not to strive in the
   light of one's own understanding only, but rather to trust another, to
   humbly receive his counsel, and gladly to follow him as a director, for
   this is a great help to those that are newly converted and a wholesome
   sign of spiritual progress.

   Therefore a man who doth so resolve to serve God continually,
   diligently to amend his life and to keep himself carefully from all
   sin, doth thereby become more worthy and more acceptable than if he fed
   an hundred poor persons without making such a resolution to govern
   himself; because the greatest gift that man can offer to God is a good
   and perfect will to serve Him all the days of one's life. So long as a
   man doth abide by his holy purpose his death cannot be ill, for though
   he die, I do trust that he will be in a state of Salvation, and shall
   find mercy, because his intent was good, and a good will shall be
   counted to him for righteousness as if he had carried out his purpose:
   as holy David doth confess, saying, "O Lord, thou hast crowned us with
   a shield of thy good-will."

   Many other words of comfort spake he to strengthen the devout young men
   who were gathered together in his house from divers parts to employ
   their time in spiritual study, not in the School of learning only, but
   also in the School of Christ.

   (3) Some of these would note his words in a book, and eagerly show them
   to such as had been absent, quoting these words of Divine eloquence
   amongst themselves with a far keener zest than worldlings show in
   repeating witty sayings. He abstained altogether from dealing with deep
   questions, subtle arguments and difficult matters, knowing that such
   things yield but little edification to devout minds, but rather are
   often an hindrance to heartfelt repentance, and overturn the faith of
   the innocent. And thus it hath been found with many men, that those who
   looking closely into curious matters leave the plain and lowly way of
   Christ, do thereby sow into themselves the seeds of many falls and
   errors.

   (4) A certain learned monk was once arguing with a Carthusian, on the
   ground that his order being devoted to that solitude and peace which
   give a man leisure for the things of his own soul, it would seem to
   produce scarcely any fruit in the Church of God; but the good monk made
   this wise and apt reply: "We would gladly do those things which ye
   preach and teach, but we believe that contempt of the world is better
   taught by acts of penitence than by beautiful sermons and many
   wanderings."

   A certain Jew who had been converted to the Christian faith hearing the
   report of the holy life of Master Florentius, desired to confer with
   him about the Patriarchs and Prophets of old, because he was thought to
   be learned in the old law and in Hebrew, and was by many called
   "Rabbi," after the manner of the Jewish sect; and when he came into the
   presence of Florentius that Man of God received him kindly and heard
   him patiently, conferring with him in all gentleness and charity,
   urging him to keep the true faith in Christ and to labour in good
   works; but as for those questions of the Law that pertain not to
   salvation, and those genealogies of the men of old, he would not
   breathe a word upon them, not because he was ignorant in such matters,
   but because they bring no edification.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIV

   Of his effectual preaching and his knowledge of the Scriptures

   (1)

   THIS revered Priest preached not smooth flatteries, but testified
   clearly of the Truth; his aim was not worldly eloquence but simple
   instruction in conduct and to lead his hearers by reasoning to reject
   the world after the example of the Saints, He sought not money from the
   rich, nor honour among the great, but discoursed more freely with
   simple folk, on whose behalf he was instant with those in high places
   that they should be mindful of the poor, and "by means of the mammon of
   unrighteousness make to themselves friends in the habitations of the
   Kingdom of Heaven." Could any lightly refuse to hear his intercession?
   Verily he dared not do so lest an offended God should refuse to hear
   his own petitions.

   (2) Once a priest who had charge of the Church of Deventer, and was a
   good friend to Florentius, came to him offering him service in sincere
   goodwill and said, "My beloved Master, if I can do anything to please
   thee, spare me not"; and that good father answered, "For the present
   time there is nothing save that thou wouldest show thyself to be well
   disposed to the Brothers and Sisters who are placed in thy charge, that
   they be not troubled by them of the world and froward men"; and the
   other piously assenting to this, replied, "I will gladly do this for
   the love of God and of you all that ye may be also mindful of me."

   Master John Boheme also, who was Rector of the Scholars, and Vicar of
   the Great Church, under whose direction I long attended the school, was
   a friend to Florentius, and heard him gladly, doing what he knew would
   be pleasing to God. And when the time to pay the fees was come, each
   scholar brought what was justly due, and I also put my fee into his
   hand and asked for a book which I had deposited as a pledge for
   payment. And he having some knowledge of me, and aware that I was under
   the care of Florentius, said, "Who gave thee this money?" and I
   answered, "My lord Florentius." "Then go," said he, "take back his
   money, since for love of him I will take nothing from thee." So I took
   back the money again to my lord, Florentius, and said, "The Master hath
   given back my fee for love of thee"; and Florentius said, "I thank him
   and will repay him, after another fashion with gifts more excellent
   than money." He knew by his discerning spirit what answer to make to
   everyone, and by his gift of counsel could supply an wholesome medicine
   both to the learned and unlearned, and all who sought aid for their
   divers needs, but he required no earthly reward for such service.

   (3) Wherefore one who had committed himself to his direction said, "As
   often as I have followed the counsels of Florentius, it hath been well
   with me; but whensoever I have striven in the light of mine own
   understanding evil hath ever happened to me, and I have repented that I
   acted not according to his direction. "His knowledge of the Holy
   Scriptures shone brightly like some ray from heaven within him, and his
   mind was illumined with so pure a light of divine radiance that whether
   he was reading the Old or New Testament some mystic interpretation of
   every passage came to him, and he everywhere found something to
   instruct him and lead him to God, the Fount of all; knowledge and the
   End of every word. The books that he kept to his hand were simple moral
   Treatises, especially the "Mirror for Monks," and certain manuals of
   virtuous exercises against sin wherewith he trained himself and his
   fellow soldiers in Christ's army to fight triumphantly against the
   temptations of the devil. But the Novices, the inexperienced, and those
   that were swollen with worldly pride, and those that were yet tainted
   with love of carnal things, he did dissuade from studying deep and
   subtle questions, and from prying curiously into dark and doubtful
   matters.

   (4) Therefore he taught that all such must first learn to humble
   themselves, to know well their own weakness, to submit themselves
   utterly to their Superiors, to prefer themselves before no man, to keep
   peace and amity with all, to have the fear of God ever in their heart,
   and having made their foundation sure in lowliness, at length by the
   indwelling grace of the Holy Ghost to climb to the height of clear
   knowledge and the light of that full vision of God which is promised to
   the pure in heart by that saying of the Lord, "Blessed are the pure in
   heart for they shall see God."

   (5) They that seek to be thought subtle rather than to be humble, and
   desire knowledge more than a good life are easily puffed up, and are
   carnally minded; such men Florentius would severely reprove, and recall
   to a wholesome knowledge of their own weakness by humiliation and
   frequent exercises of devotion. When it was necessary for him to
   impeach any, he was held in such awe that none ventured to contradict
   him, or excuse himself, by reason of the reverence inspired by his holy
   life, which none durst offend lest they should incur the wrath of God
   by not humbly obeying such directions.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXV

   How he set a guard upon his tongue and avoided oaths

   (1)

   ONCE when he was residing at Amersfoort he was received with all
   veneration by the inhabitants of that city and by the great men of the
   district, who visited him from time to time in pious devotion. Then
   also certain honourable men came to dine with him and the Brothers, in
   order to hear his discourse, desiring to enjoy familiar intercourse
   with him, and to be instructed by his good example and doctrine. These
   he treated kindly, exhorting them with wholesome counsel according to
   their station, and when they had heard the Word of God they returned
   severally to their own homes with thanksgiving.

   (2) And when they had departed he briefly admonished the Brothers,
   saying, "It is a dangerous thing to speak and to associate with the
   Great and them of the world. It is not expedient to flatter the rich,
   nor is it convenient that the inner secrets should be told to them;
   wherefore it is needful for a man to look carefully to what he saith to
   such, lest they be scandalized by any light word or unseemly action.
   For their eyes are ever looking upon us to consider our bearing, by
   reason of the good report which they hear of us. Let us stand therefore
   upon our guard, and set a good example to those from without who seek
   to visit us, for they see our outward actions only, and from these
   judge of what is within. Although we are not perfect in all things, let
   us take care that we give no ill example nor occasion of stumbling to
   the weak. These guests of ours are too kind to us, and perhaps their
   kindness is not to our profit. Let us not be over-pleased with empty
   praise, for it is our duty to be simple and lowly. It were better
   therefore to return quickly to our former dwelling, where there are
   many who take less thought of us, and some who even mock, and speak
   evil of us, a thing which is very profitable, and doth constrain us the
   more to turn again to God.

   (3) And thus Florentius was guarded and thoughtful in all his speech,
   especially before them of the world and persons whom he knew not.
   Likewise he was strict in avoiding that most evil custom of swearing,
   which is common among men of the world; and he forbade any of his
   Community in their daily talk to use such phrases as "Verily I do
   swear," or "Of a surety I swear"; lest by such heedless swearing they
   should pile up sin on sin. Wherefore whenever he wished to lay stress
   upon any notable or important matter, or when he must bear testimony to
   anything, he would not lightly or hardily introduce the form of an
   oath, but would answer in his gentle way, "This is the conclusion of
   the matter," or "this is surely so"; and thus he satisfied his
   questioner. Nor would he confidently affirm anything wherein he might
   be mistaken, but remembering the saying of the Lord, "Let your yea be
   yea and your nay, nay," he was careful to guard against any slip of the
   tongue, and to instruct others by his good example, and by telling the
   plain truth; wherefore men trusted his word without an oath rather than
   that of others whose tongues had the evil custom of much swearing.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXVI

   Of three temptations that are full of peril to the devout

   (1)

   MASTER FLORENTIUS being a most skilful and mighty champion in the
   Spiritual contest used to say that there were three temptations,
   perilous above all others, which hidden beneath the cloak of good
   motives do deceive many; and unless a man resist these in due time,
   that is at the very outset, they lead little by little to a final
   overthrow, or make the indolent wretchedly lukewarm. But this doth make
   the matter worse, that through the subtility of the devil's wiles many
   are too heedless of such temptations, and scarce seek to be informed by
   men of prudence and knowledge as to the greatness of the perils into
   which they may fall.

   (2) The first temptation is when one, newly converted, doth desire to
   return to his own country and to visit parents and friends; for such an
   one a return to the world, on the pretext of doing good and in the hope
   of converting worldlings, is often the occasion of his neglecting his
   own soul, although he may think to gather truit in his own country. And
   while he dallieth there amid vain and inconstant persons, he doth
   expose himself to the winds and waves of temptation. Experience hath
   often shown how one that is lightminded, and not yet firmly founded in
   virtue, when he doth join himself to them of the world without
   restraint, is either entangled by their sins, or, under stress of
   temptation, doth grow cold toward the good courses he had begun.
   Therefore is it good for a man continually to flee from everything that
   is hurtful to the soul, and not to return to his country or his friends
   unless some notable cause compel him. Let him never be presumptuous
   about himself, but be suspicious of this present world that is
   everywhere filled with poisoned snares; let him follow the counsel and
   sayings of his Superior, for this in every case is the safer and surer
   way. Of ten men who associate for long with their kindred or friends,
   scarce one or two return unhurt, and it doth often happen that they who
   remain in the world, having withdrawn from their good resolutions
   become even worse and more worthless than other men: and rejecting the
   Grace of God blush not to resume those evil courses which they did once
   despise.

   (3) The second temptation is when one that is a layman, wishing to be a
   Clerk, doth through this desire leave his lowly station, and retire
   from the holy Community in order that he may acquire learning and
   become great.

   Wretched man! he knoweth not how evilly he is deceived when leaving his
   lowly station and obedience he seeketh higher place. Such an one is
   soon puffed up by a little knowledge and is slow to become a good
   Clerk. God grant that he become not altogether a worldling; that of his
   own motion and for the sake of worthless learning doth risk the loss of
   virtue and blacken the repute of a good name.

   (4) The third temptation is when one that is already a Clerk and
   learned doth aspire to the Priesthood, to high preferment or to any
   other dignity, on the plea of some holy motive such as u that of being
   the more able to be of profit to others, or of teaching better or of
   preaching more frequently. Although such an one may seem to have a good
   motive, yet inwardly he is weighed down by grievous pride in that he is
   in haste to go up higher so as to appear greater than his fellows. In
   that he loveth not lowly subjection and is unwilling to despise
   himself, he doth diligently beseech his friends that they recommend him
   for promotion, but heedeth not the danger of his own soul.

   Alas! when he hath attained that little short-lived shadow of glory,
   gotten with a great effort, an effort indeed far greater than that
   which would suffice to deprive him of every honour, in how evil a case
   will he find his conscience.

   (5) Let him who would be delivered from these three temptations pray
   God every day to save him from pride and vain conceit, and keep him in
   lowly subjection and perfect obedience; for pride doth make a man to be
   inwardly blind and without savour, and outwardly a vain babbler,
   presumptuous, ignorant of himself and despising others; and, what is
   worse, to seek lordship over others is clearly enough a sign of
   perdition and leadeth to many evils. When a certain Brother was talking
   with Florentius in his cell the Master said, amongst other things: "Ye
   should study to give yourselves to lowliness, then may ye make progress
   and become worthy of the Grace of God."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXVII

   Of his sending forth the Brothers to gather fruit in divers places

   (1)

   FLORENTIUS, being most fervent in the love of Christ and one to whom to
   live was Christ and to die was gain, desired to bear fruit in his
   season; therefore he took care to be of profit to many, that they might
   attain the Kingdom of everlasting salvation, persuading them to despise
   this miserable world that passeth away. To this end he sent many
   persons to found several monasteries and new houses for the conversion
   of others. Some of these Brothers went to Windesheim, some to Mount St.
   Agnes, some to Northern, some to Gelders, some to Holland; some became
   Priors of Monasteries, other Superiors of Communities, and Confessors
   to the Monks: and of these there are certain still alive who knew this
   most devout Master Florentius, the beloved of God, while he was yet
   living in the flesh, and can bear sure testimony as to his saintly
   life.

   (2) Likewise the Holy Orders of Carthusians. Cistercians, and
   Benedictines contain men not unknown to me who were worthy to see and
   hear both Florentius himself and his Brothers when they tarried in
   Deventer; these will bear witness that I speak the truth.

   Also at the time when this notable priest of God shone as a light and
   flourished in Deventer, there were many other devout priests in the
   Diocese of Utrecht who instructed the faithful with holy discourse and
   knew how to bear strict rule over Communities whether of Brothers or of
   Nuns. All these submitted themselves humbly to Florentius with all due
   reverence, and gladly consulted that angelic man in difficult cases,
   preferring to trust his prudence and discernment rather than their own
   judgement. For they saw that in him above all other men the grace of
   Divine wisdom flourished pre-eminently, and though he lived in the
   midst of crowds yet, like a lily of the valley, bedewed with the water
   of wisdom, he kept the whiteness of his purity, and far and wide
   diffused the odour of his good reputation.

   (3) At this time also there lived in the Diocese of Utrecht one Master
   Wermbold, a famous preacher and Confessor to the Nuns of St. Cecilia.
   He was an ardent lover of Holy Scripture and a great friend to the
   reverend Father Florentius; and the common people loved to hear and see
   him.

   At Amersfoort there was Master William Henry, the Founder of that
   Community of Clerks who afterward became Canons Regular. In Zwolle
   there was Master Henry Goude, a notable preacher, a despiser of Mammon,
   and a humble Confessor to the Beguines; likewise Master Gerard Kalkar,
   the Director of the devout Clerks, and an excellent instructor in
   virtue.

   In Holland there flourished certain famous priests, learned in the Law
   of the Lord, and notable for their words and deeds, some of whom were
   fellow soldiers with Master Gerard Groote, and very dear to Florentius,
   and these gathered no small harvest for the Lord by converting men and
   edifying Communities of the Devout. In Haarlem there was Master Hugo,
   called the Goldsmith, and his priests; in Amsterdam Gisebert Dow, the
   founder of the two monasteries, and the renowned Director of many Nuns.
   In Medenblic Master Paul, who was altogether devoted to God and a man
   of probity. Master Gerard has made mention of these in his letters, and
   it was through them that the Devout Life first began and made progress
   in Holland.

   (4) Moreover at Doesbruch in Gelders there was Master Derick Gruter, a
   laudable man and a Father to many Nuns; he was aforetime a disciple of
   Gerard, and told me many good things of him. It were a lengthy task to
   mention byname each one of those devout Fathers who began to flourish
   in the time of Gerard and were contemporaries with Florentius; men who
   taught us to despise the vanities of the world, and to live humbly and
   continently, and left to them that followed after a bright example of
   holy conversation by their patience and obedience.

CHAPTER XXVIII

   Of his happy passing from this world and his burial in the Church

   (1)

   IESUS, out ot his abundant kindness, doth stablish and redeem the
   faithful, and hath most surely promised them Eternal life and a full
   recompense, saying: "Everyone that hath forsaken father or mother or
   other earthly ties for my Name's Sake shall receive an hundredfold and
   shall possess life everlasting." He therefore saw fit as a reward to
   the holy Florentius His faithful servant--who was adorned with many
   virtues and had been proved by divers burdens and infirmities--to
   deliver him out of the prison house of this flesh, and to remove him to
   His own Kingdom in Heaven, whereat the Angels did rejoice.

   (2) So when Florentius by his counsel and aid had founded as many
   devout Communities and Monasteries as he could and had instructed the
   lowly flock of his own house in the ordinances of peace and brotherly
   love according to Christ's good pleasure, and had carefully guarded
   them therein, he began inwardly to sigh and ardently to long to see the
   citizens of the heavenly country and the glory of Christ, toward Whom
   he had confidence in all things, and Whom he loved above all else.

   Wherefore with true devotion he asked that the Body of the Lord should
   be administered to him, and gazing thereupon with faith unwavering, and
   adoring the same with the reverence that is due, he said: "Oh! my
   Beloved Lord God, pardon me that I have so often touched and received
   Thee so unworthily." At these words many were pricked to the heart and
   wept, and one of the Canons who heard his words groaned deeply, saying:
   "Then what should I say, miserable sinner that I am, if a man so good
   doth feel and say such things about himself!"

   But Florentius, having received the Very Body of God, and being
   fortified with the grace of Christ, gave himself up wholly to the good
   pleasure of God, and so long as he could speak he poured forth words of
   most wholesome comfort to his beloved Sons and Brothers.

   (3) Amongst other things worthy to be remembered, he commended the
   unity of Brotherly Love, saying: "All who dwell in one house should be
   one in thought, should hold one purpose in the Lord, and should ever
   aim at conforming to one standard, without varying, in simple obedience
   to their superior. Wheresoever the Brothers do strive in fervency of
   spirit to be of one mind and to conform themselves in all things by the
   pattern of Christ's humility, there is peace, there is spiritual
   progress, there is a house well ordered. Abide in your lowly simplicity
   and Christ shall abide with you."

   After this holy exhortation he set one of his priests over the whole
   Community, lest they, the Lord's flock, should remain without a
   director, and being set amid the waves of the world, should be as a
   ship that hath not a proper helm; therefore he set over them Amilius, a
   devout man, wise and learned, and one that was not backward in zeal for
   God and for the salvation of souls, bidding that each one of them
   should have recourse to him, and obey him willingly. When he had
   quietly settled these and other matters he came to the last moment of
   this present life, for his bodily weakness was increasing.

   (4) Now the most sacred Festival of the Annunciation was at hand, for
   this was the Vigil of that Feast, in honour of the glorious Mother of
   God, most Blessed Mary, ever Virgin! Most Holy Mother of Jesus Christ,
   whom Florentius the devout Vicar of her Son had ever loved with deep
   devotion. So, after the hour of Compline, when the customary Antiphon
   had been chanted in honour of Our Lady, and the Angelus had rung at the
   close of day he made an end of his life on earth while the Brothers
   round him prayed with sighs and tears. It was no marvel that they did
   so, for the might of their deep love constrained them to weep when
   their most beloved Father, the light and mirror of all the devout, the
   comforter of all that were troubled, was taken away from the light of
   temporal day, yet when they that loved him thought upon the sober and
   modest life of this most excellent priest, their pious faith did
   comfort them with the hope that glory in heaven should not be denied
   him, through Jesus Christ, Whom he had loved with all his heart, to
   Whom he had clung continually till the very instant of death, and
   served with the full devotion of faith.

   (5) So Master Florentius, this Priest beloved of God and man, passed
   from this world in the fourteen hundredth year after the Incarnation of
   the Lord, during the reign of Pope Boniface IX, being forty-nine years
   old as I reckon, or but little more. He lived in good and holy
   conversation for nearly sixteen years after the death of the venerable
   Master Gerard, and during this time he gathered much fruit among the
   people of God, in Deventer and the whole Diocese of Utrecht. For his
   laudable life, let Christ Who adorned our time with a star of so bright
   a lustre, be praised and glorified for evermore.

   On the day following the Canons and Clerks assembled, and the poor
   body, worn by long-continued chastisement, was carried by the Canons
   and Priests in procession to the Church of St. Lebuin and there
   interred with the rites proper to burial and all reverence, before that
   Altar in the Church which is dedicated in honour of St. Paul. The
   chosen Priest of God, as became a humble servant of Christ, had himself
   desired to be buried in the Cemetery with the Brothers who had died
   before him, and that no further honour should be paid him; but that
   Reverend Master Rambert, the Dean of Deventer, would by no means allow
   this, but determined rather, and that most rightly, that he should be
   buried with honour in a prominent place within that Church of which he
   had been a priest notable for virtue and adorned with learning.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XXIX

   Of a vision which was seen after his death, and of the great glory
   which he attained.

   (1)

   THERE was, in the city of Gorichem, a certain man named John Hermann,
   whose life was good and his reputation honourable, and his wife was
   called Jutta. These two did alike live after the commandments of God,
   and drew many others to serve Him; they did often talk together of God
   upon holy days in their own house, and gladly snowed hospitality to
   many Religious who came to visit them. Both of these were well known to
   Florentius, and learned from him the manner of holy conversation, and
   they set an example of life before their neighbours.

   Now shortly after the death of Florentius, the aforesaid John did also
   depart from this world, and on a certain day, Jutta, who was most
   devout toward God, was occupied with prayer in her chamber. And having
   finished her devotion she arose to go forth from her chamber, and as
   she was opening the door she suddenly heard the window of the room open
   behind her.

   (2) Looking back therefore she saw some one enter by the window who was
   clad round with a glory of light and most lovely to look upon, being in
   face like her husband, and she said, "Art thou there, John, my beloved
   husband?" and that other replied, "It is I, but call me no more thy
   husband"; and Jutta asked, "How is it with thee?" and he answered, "I
   am saved, and I enjoy the happiness of Heaven and the Presence of God."
   Then Jutta asked, "And how is it with our father, Lord Florentius?" and
   he answered, "Florentius hath a glory that is truly great; and all his
   works were found to be upright and good," and he added, "Remain thou in
   this house and change not thine abode, for thou shalt die ere long; and
   tell this to Adelaide the daughter of Thomas, the Superior of the
   Sisterhood," and then the Vision departed. After these things Jutta
   spent the rest of her days, though they were but few, with a heart so
   fervent toward God that all worldly things seemed to her but as
   worthless dung; and it is manifest by this sign alone, that the
   aforesaid vision was no vain deceit, but an heavenly revelation sent by
   God.

   (3) When one asked concerning the great glory of Florentius, it was
   answered to him, "It was chiefly because of three virtues. First, that
   great love which he had toward God, referring to Him as the Final cause
   of all the good things which he had, and in all things seeking His
   Honour and good pleasure. Secondly, that zeal for souls which he had
   toward his neighbours, in that he sought the salvation of all, and
   eagerly led them to God's service. Thirdly, because of his deep
   humility and contempt of himself, in that he always thought little and
   slightingly of himself." These three things appear clearly and
   distinctly enough in his life, which is here written, and there are
   many of the faithful who are not ignorant thereof.

A LETTER AND

CERTAIN NOTABLE SAYINGS OF

FLORENTIUS

   A Letter from Florentius to one of the Canons regular at Windesbeim

   (1)

   MY MOST BELOVED,

   WHY dost thou trouble me thus? Are not mine own miseries enough for me?
   Yet overcome by weariness and yielding to thine importunity I am
   constrained to write to thee of matters that concern me not. Firstly,
   for all these necessities of thine I bid thee be thus importunate
   before God, in knocking continually at His door, and He shall
   straightway open to thee and give thee light far clearer than any man
   could give, although thou didst persist without ceasing in asking him
   questions, knocking at his door and making supplication to him, and he
   spent a whole lifetime in writing to thee.

   Secondly, I urge thee above all things to submit thyself humbly to all
   men. It is expedient for thee to do this in thought, word and deed.

   Continually remember, as the Blessed Bernard said to the Brothers on
   the Mount of God, that there is sunshine everywhere save in thy
   conscience, and a clear sky everywhere save in thy heart.

   This humility doth come by constant use and by considering thine own
   worthlessness in both body and soul, not by dwelling upon the faults of
   other men or making excuses for thyself. Above all things be careful
   when thou dost reprove another, not to exalt thyself. The Blessed
   Jerome commenting upon St. Mark, saith, "The blind man who was restored
   to light by the Lord saw men as trees walking." In like manner (saith
   he) a sinner should think that all men are higher than himself. So do
   thou look upon all the Brothers as being trees for loftiness compared
   with thyself. In thy work take upon thee the baser and menial tasks,
   and from time to time think upon thine own vileness, or else meditate
   of death, punishment, judgement, or any other thing that may abase thee
   or kindle thy love for God and thy neighbour. For the object of such
   meditation should be either to acquire this love, or to root out thy
   vices, or to attain virtue.

   (2) Thirdly, as St. Bernard saith to the Brothers on the Mount of God,
   once daily compare to-day with yesterday, that thou mayest judge thy
   progress in virtue, or thy backsliding.

   Learn to sit in judgement upon thyself once or twice every day, to set
   thy life in order, to regulate thy conduct, to accuse, condemn, or
   exact punishment from thyself. I counsel thee to keep to hand "The
   Mirror for Monks" or "The Mirror of Saint Bernard," that thou mayest
   order thy doings thereby. The contents of this book thou shouldest
   repeat because in whatsoever thou art engaged these will readily
   suggest how thou shouldest behave thyself, and that wherein thy conduct
   hath been amiss. Likewise prevent all thy doings with meditation and
   brief prayer as to the manner in which thou shouldest act, and this
   will be easy to thee when by continued use thou canst repeat the
   contents of the book.

   (3) Fourthly, early in the day and after the morning meal put before
   thine eyes thy evil habits, and the chiefest of thy vices, and also the
   virtues after which thou wouldest strive, and thus ever renew in thy
   heart the struggle with thy foes--the world, the flesh, and the devil;
   do this nothing doubting, for they that are with us are more than they
   that are against us. So wilt thou fulfil the precept of St. Bernard:
   "In the morning reckon with thyself for the night that is past, and
   take heed to thyself for the coming day how thou wouldest order thy
   conduct throughout its course." The same also saith: "For every hour
   write down the exercises thou shouldest perform therein. Spiritual
   exercises for the hours of prayer, bodily exercises for the hours of
   labour, so that at Vespers when thou dost reckon up thy several deeds
   if thou dost find any duty ill done, as to the manner, or the place, or
   time in which it was done, it may not go unpunished or unpaid."

   Seek the common good and keep thy heart ever lifted up.

   Pray for me, my Brother, for I have always been negligent in this, and
   fare thee well.

   Before the morning meal meditate upon our Lord's Passion: afterward of
   death, judgement, and the pains of Hell: after supper think on thy
   vices and thy sins.

   Certain notable Sayings of Master Florentius the Priest

   (1)

   BEFORE all things know thy vices and thy passions.

   Be watchful against temptation and the promptings of the passions. If
   thou dost feel these and instantly reject them they do not harm thee.
   If thou dost dally therewith it is evil; if in addition to such
   dalliance thou dost think with pleasure thereupon it is worse.

   Reply humbly to them that ask of thee.

   Avoid women, and beware of looking upon them. It is an ill example to
   the world to keep no guard over the eyes.

   Tell thy sins with shame and sorrow, and a full intention to put them
   from thee, in the presence of God and thy confessor.

   Tell thy faults one by one saying: "This have I done." Mark well in
   what thy fault doth lie, and tell this in simple words.

   Thou oughtest not to speak evil of any, unless it can profit thee or
   him.

   When thou dost accuse another be pitiful as to a weak Brother.

   When thou doest nothing save that which accordeth with Holy Scripture,
   and understandest the same according to the interpretation of the
   Saints--not relying upon thine own interpretation--then is thy
   conscience good, and thy reason right.

   It were good for a spiritually minded man to deal with his temporal
   concerns at an appointed time, and afterwards to return to his
   spiritual duties forgetting all else.

   (2) I think that the thoughts and promptings which come into our hearts
   are not under our own control,--but it is in our power to plant good in
   the heart by reading, prayer, and meditation until these promptings to
   what is unlawful are overcome and yield, and by the grace of God do
   cease.

   The pride of some is such that they must always rule over others, or
   else altogether fall away and return to the world--for they know not
   how to put themselves on an equality with others, nor how to submit.

   Oftentime the whole body is affected by the passions which do rule a
   man, though he know not the cause of his emotion. There was one that in
   the summer could not sleep, nor eat well, and at first he could not
   discover the cause thereof, but he afterward found that it was through
   melancholy. Thus do our passions conceal themselves within us.

   The weak should not judge the acts of their Superiors; for such
   judgements are often wrong.

   Keep nothing secret, whether it be a material thing or a thought, but
   reveal all.

   Speak seldom with a man of the world, but when thou dost, direct him to
   that which is good, according to his condition.

   (3) Avoid worldlings, great folks and revellers. If thou art about any
   lowly or menial work before other men, revile it not; to do so showeth
   pride, as if such work were not meet for thee.

   Learn to understand thy prayers, and thus wandering thoughts shall be
   driven away.

   Loud singing doth disturb the brain and the senses, and doth put out
   devotion.

   In praying thou oughtest to desire the grace and mercy of God rather
   than any great outward gifts--Mary thought herself unworthy of the
   salutation of the Angel, and being filled with the Holy Ghost went up
   into the hill country and ministered to Elizabeth. Any one that hath
   aught to say to a great king, would make to himself friends of them
   that are near to the king. So should one do in regard to Mary, who is
   in a special degree very near to God.

   All things would become pleasant to one who should exercise himself
   well by meditating upon our Lord's Passion.

   We ought to raise our heart to heaven without ceasing, and to return
   again and again to Holy Scripture, and to sigh that we are so carnal
   and sluggish in seeking the good that is eternal. By too great haste is
   devotion lost. Therefore avoid mere repetitions, and do all things with
   attention and thought, not from habit only.

   (4) When thou art bidden to do something that is hurtful to the body
   remember that thy body is not thine own, but His to Whose obedience
   thou hast surrendered thyself.

   In whatsoever degree a man hath given his goods, whether of the body or
   of the soul to the Community, in that same degree hath he part in the
   goods of the others.

   Love equally in the Lord all who are converted; the absent alike with
   those that are present with thee. Avoid doing aught to which honour is
   attached, and aught of which thou mayest vainly boast, if it may be
   done equally well by another; and if anything may be so done by another
   or in some other place, love to have it so, and praise it more than if
   it were done by thee.

   Be not envious that another is holier than thou, or hath higher fame,
   but love the gifts of God in him and they shall be thine own.

   Nothing doth quench the sins of the flesh so well as earnest study; get
   the habit of remaining in thy cell and reading thy book; compel thyself
   to do so until it doth become pleasant to thee, and to go out seemeth a
   hardship, to come in a delight. Flee to thy cell as to a friend, for
   thou art safe therein.

   Whensoever a man talketh with his fellows, he ought to strive to
   impress lowliness upon them.

   Worldly knowledge is very alluring; therefore let a man beware that he
   be not too much attracted thereto; let him earnestly desire to pass
   over to God by means of such knowledge, and not be satisfied therewith
   as an end in itself.

   (5) The devout and venerable Father often said to his friends and
   Brothers: "How good it is for you, and how stably do ye stand in that
   ye are able to live under obedience!" If he had known this before, he
   would not, he said, for anything in the world have begun by ruling over
   others unless he had himself first lived under obedience--and unless it
   were that bodily weakness hindered him he would wish still to be under
   some strict Master who would altogether break down his will.

   Also if he were under obedience he would never be perplexed, for every
   man ought to put the burden of his doubt upon the back of another: he
   ought to humble himself beneath all who are converted, even beneath the
   young, for he knoweth not how much grace God may have given to them.

   No one can ever attain true humility unless he is despised by others
   and is not regarded in anything. It were better to be trodden under
   foot than to consent to the praise of others.

   When any of the Brothers doth ask counsel of thee, thou oughtest humbly
   to tell him the precepts thou hast read, for it is better always to
   follow the direction of others than thine own, unless thou seest that
   some better course is revealed to thee by the humility of thy
   questioner; but in such case never ascribe the revelation to thine own
   merits. If a man hath phantasies, then ought he to lift his voice in
   prayer.

   (6) A man ought to direct all his exercises and studies to the conquest
   of his passions and weaknesses, for otherwise he doth profit little
   thereby.

   In the hours of common labour stand ever on thy guard, and be careful
   of much speaking; think of that which thou hast read in thine hours of
   study.

   There is no spiritual disease so great that it may not be cured by true
   obedience if a man hath wholly resigned himself he ought not to be more
   self-reliant, nor more despondent, than his Superior tells him to be. A
   man ought often, and day by day, to resign himself to God and his
   Superior; to bow the knees of his heart for pardon and to obey with his
   understanding. I am amazed that one who is under obedience can feel
   doubts in place of being content. When thou doest any good act be
   careful that thou do it wholly for God's sake, and that thou desire no
   other thing save His Honour and the edification of thy neighbour.

   When thou art among the Brothers thou shouldest think: "Oh! that I
   might so behave that none should be offended through me!"

   Thou shouldest seek the common good, for if thou dost begin by seeking
   thine own good in that which is least, thou wilt soon proceed to do so
   in greater things.

   (7) Whatever is for the common good, this ought we to strive to guard
   with care, as for instance, the Holy Vessels of the Altar. The books of
   Holy Scripture should be guarded as the truest treasures of the Church.
   In writing we ought not to seek to show our own skill only, as for
   instance by writing a good hand, but also the good of all--e.g., that
   the books may be correct, well punctuated and clear, for one cannot
   study to advantage in bad or unfaithful copies.

   Woe to him who living in a Community doth seek his own, or say that
   anything is his.

   Woe to him who so living doth murmur about aught, or cause dissension
   in the Community: or trouble it in any manner.

   (8) If we are one in will, in savour, and in custom in the Lord, then
   do we truly dwell together in unity.

   Let every man study to conform himself to the Community in all his work
   and conduct; whether it be in reading, chanting, eating or fasting, let
   him not be singular. Nothing doth make a man so peaceful as the rule of
   never presuming to do anything of himself, but rather submitting
   altogether to the counsel of good men; and let a man always believe
   that it is more wholesome that such should consult for him.

   Be earnest humbly to fulfil what is commanded thee, for if thou dost
   desire to question a command thou shalt hardly be truly obedient.

   Seek devotion with all thy heart by diligent prayer. Wandering thoughts
   quench devotion as water quencheth fire.

   Though thou art poor in virtue, and weak, thou oughtest not to be cast
   down thereby, but rather to humble thyself and think: "Since I have no
   great gifts I will make the little that I have an offering to God, as
   Mary offered a pair of turtle doves and not a lamb. He is truly a
   Brother and friend who doth hate the vices of another and help him to
   overcome them.

   Thou oughtest always to strive to occupy thyself with some good thing,
   and to pay no heed at all to phantasies.

   (9) It is very dangerous to converse often or associate with men of the
   world who have authority and dignity, as Councillors, Priests, Canons,
   and other wealthy men. The reason is that since one is naturally in awe
   of them he doth often applaud them, and give assent to their words.

   Beware of much speaking, specially before worldlings, for a man seldom
   speaketh much without afterward repenting of some rash word.

   Likewise abstain from jesting and loud laughter, for whatsoever men see
   thee to be outwardly, such do they judge thee to be inwardly, though
   thou art not really so.

   Much study is of little profit unless it be directed to the amending of
   one's life and to ordering oneself diligently in right conduct, for the
   Devil knoweth many things about the Scripture and yet is his knowledge
   of no profit to Him.

   If one is slow and sluggish in spirit in the morning, yet should he not
   be despondent, for God is able to give him the grace of devotion at
   whatever time it may please him.

   Preface thy labour with some short prayer.

   (10) The servant of Christ ought to speak briefly and in a low tone,
   and to be careful not to speak when tis riot needful. If necessity
   compel, let him go apart to some private place that is open to him, and
   consider whether it is expedient to speak.

   Thou oughtest always to strive to edify thy hearers by thy words, and
   to draw them nearer to the service of Christ: since nothing is more
   pleasing to God than labour for the conversion of souls.

   Likewise we can do nothing more hurtful to Him than by making another
   to offend by our bad example, or loosing him from His service, for this
   is worse than to have crucified Christ in the flesh as did the Jews.

   Before thou doest anything thou oughtest to strive for purity of heart,
   and to apply thyself to pious meditation, because from this doth spring
   Charity, prayer and devotion; and all the other virtues are
   strengthened thereby.

   Never be idle, but be busied with some occupation, especially some holy
   one, directing all thy motives and thy work to the service of God.

   (11) A portion of the Spirit is better than much knowledge without
   devotion: for to acquire the trick of beautiful language is easy, but
   to find the way to good works is hard.

   Whatever a man may have done, let him know that he hath gained nothing
   if he doth not feel himself to be made thereby the humbler; when thou
   doest aught that is good, do it in simplicity and purity of mind to the
   honour of God, and seek not to advantage thyself in any way.

   From heedlessness in word come troubles, offences, and slanders. Look
   therefore to what thou doest, why thou doest it, and in what manner.

   That by which God is angered and thy neighbour offended is no slight
   matter.

   Before thou dost begin any work, set before thee how thou wouldest
   behave thyself therein, and do not lightly break this rule.

   Hasten to thy cell and thou shalt recover the devotion thou hast lost.

   (12) When two or three converse together let each one see to it that
   their talking go not forward to what is profitless, but if this should
   happen thou oughtest to say charitably and humbly, but without
   shamefacedness, "Brother, it is not expedient for us to talk any more;
   let us go to our cell and do something better." The servant should
   strive, so far as in him lies, to turn his heart away from the creature
   and from all earthly longings; the more one doth progress in this, the
   more doth the desire for the love of God increase.

   (13) If any would make good progress, let him study to do violence to
   himself, that is, let him strive to overcome his vices; for example, if
   he formerly desired lofty things he should now seek lowliness; and so
   forth in the case of other vices.

   One that is truly obedient ought never to think slightingly of a
   command, even though it may seem a small matter. When the Devil seeth
   us lowly and one in heart, then verily doth he flee from us, because he
   is the father of pride, and of discord.

   We ought not to pay heed to our neighbour for his beauty or his wealth,
   but for that he is redeemed by the Blood of Christ.

   The servant of God should strive to keep peace and concord with the
   Brothers; for this do the angels love more than aught else and this do
   they more gladly see in us, namely, that we are each and all
   peacemakers and one in heart.

   (14) The servant of Christ should never feel safe, whatever good he may
   do, but be ever fearful about himself, lest perchance he may be found a
   reprobate before our Lord Jesus.

   Before all things he should strive to think all other men holier and
   better than himself.

   Devotion is nothing else than the desire of the soul toward God.

   If a man earnestly endeavour to act humbly, however little he may
   follow our custom, yet shall it be counted to him for obedience. But if
   he neglect this and care not for it I fear that he shall be punished
   severely.

   (15) One that doth desire to make progress in humility must often set
   before him hard and menial tasks, chide himself, judge and condemn, and
   in his secret thoughts ponder over his own worthlessness so as to be
   able patiently to bear contempt when humiliations come upon him.

   When thou dost feel envy, or suspicion, or vainglory arising in thy
   heart, reply inwardly thereto and say: "Fie upon thee that thou art
   still so wretched and weak and that thou dost go forward less than
   other men, and dost become continually worse."

   Thus humble and confound thyself inwardly and the temptations of the
   Devil shall flee from thee, for it is he that doth inspire these evil
   passions. We ought to expend great labour in striving against carnal
   things if we wish to conquer them.

   We seldom or never eat but the Devil lieth in wait for us.

   Wherefore let us ever watch and pray, because the Adversary never
   sleepeth, but doth assault us on every side.

                  LIVES OF THE FOLLOWERS OF FATHER FLORENTIUS

PREFACE

   The Elder Brother

   ENABLED by the gift of God I have now in my account of these venerable
   fathers and illustrious men Master Gerard and Father Florentius
   described certain of their vertuous deeds, using that unpolished style
   to which the poverty of my genius doth compel me. It remaineth in the
   next place to set down as they come into my mind such memorials of
   their followers as may avail to instruct in humility the lives and
   characters of simple brethren.

   These men followed Christ by the narrow way that leadeth unto life,
   manfully treading under foot the pomp of the world, and the softness of
   the flesh, so that they are not unworthy to be compared to the
   luminaries of heaven, for by their virtues they enlightened a vast
   multitude of faithful people whom they unceasingly exhorted to good
   deeds during their lifetime. Wherefore one may not keep silence as to
   their godly conversation in Christ, but must set forth their deeds,
   which are worthy of veneration, for the instruction of the little ones.

   Novice

   I earnestly entreat thee that in speaking of men so notable thou show
   me at least some few sparks of their devotion that I may be enkindled
   thereby to the love of virtue, seeing that I may set before me a new
   standard of life when I hear of the conduct of men of our own time. For
   many poets have written of the deeds of the heathen so as to profit
   their readers in this manner, and how much more oughtest thou for the
   consolation of the devout to set forth the example of these servants of
   God who have triumphed over the world, so that the good may go forward
   continually to better things, and the sluggish be roused the more
   quickly from the slothfulness of the body.

   The Elder Brother

   If thou deignest to hear me I will tell thee somewhat that shall edify
   thee not a little at this present time. I will set before thee the
   lives of men who had not only the reputation of virtue but in addition
   to that reputation led lives illustrious by virtuous deeds. Yet now
   (fie upon it) there are some who having deserted their first
   enthusiasm, love to wander abroad, delight in vain talking, prefer
   their own wisdom to the primitive institutions of our Fathers, and to
   justify the satisfaction of their own desires, employ cunning arguments
   in place of obeying the Holy Law. Do thou above all things avoid this
   foolish presumption and follow the humble character and habit of those
   approved fathers who in our time were illustrious in Deventer under the
   rule of our reverend Father Florentius.

   May grace be given me to set forth those things which tend to
   edification, that this present discourse may so instruct simple and
   humble brethren that all those who desire to follow Christ in the
   Devout Life may entirely lay aside care for this world, and study in
   the fervour of their devotion and their obedience to the law of holy
   simplicity to exhibit that same zeal which these devout and virtuous
   men exhibited in their earnest preaching.

LIFE OF JOHN GRONDE

CHAPTER I

   Of the first Congregation of Clerks in Deventer

   (1)

   THE righteousness of good men, as reason doth dictate, everywhere
   deserveth due praise. For those who lived lives worthy of praise ought
   not after their death to be given over to forgetfulness. The deeds of
   such should be held in remembrance if only for the consolation of them
   that survive; and should be set up as a pattern to other faithful
   people. Wherefore it behoves us above all to commend those who studied
   to serve God in humility and devotion in the House of our reverend
   Father Florentius from the time of the foundation of that House, and
   remained with all constancy under the rule of holy obedience with great
   fervency of Spirit unto their lives' end. Yet I do not purpose to write
   of the virtues of all of them, a thing which is by no means possible,
   but as concerning several of them I desire to record a few things that
   are within mine own knowledge.

   (2) When I had come to study in Deventer, in the days of my youth, I
   sought the way to the Regulars at Windesheim, and having found there
   the Canons Regular, amongst whom was my brother, I was led by his
   advice to approach that most reverend man Master Florentius, who was
   Vicar of the Church of Deventer, a devout priest, whose most excellent
   fame had already reached the Upper Provinces, and had drawn my mind to
   love him: for a great multitude of scholars used to praise him for his
   conduct of holy things. Both his appearance and his words confirmed his
   righteous reputation, and he was in favour in the sight of all men, for
   indeed he was a true worshipper of God and most devoted in his
   reverence for our Holy Mother the Church.

   When I came into the presence of the reverend Father he kept me for a
   while with him in his house, being moved thereto by fatherly affection;
   and he placed me in the School, and besides this gave me the books
   which he thought I needed. Afterwards he obtained for me a lodging, at
   no cost to myself, with a certain honourable and devout matron, who
   often showed kindness to me and many other Clerks. So being associated
   with this man who was so holy, and with the Brothers of his Order, I
   had their devout lives daily in my mind and before my eyes, and I took
   pleasure and delight in the contemplation of their godly conduct, and
   in the gracious words which proceeded from the mouths of these humble
   men. Never before could I recollect to have seen such men, so devout
   and fervent were they in the love of God and of their neighbour. Living
   in the world they had no part in the life thereof, and seemed to take
   no heed to worldly business. Remaining- at home they laboured carefully
   in copying books, being instant continually in sacred study and devout
   meditation. In the hours of labour they had recourse to ejaculatory
   prayer for their consolation; in the morning, having said Matins, they
   went to the Church, and during the Celebration of Mass they poured
   forth as an offering to God the first fruits of their mouth and the
   aspirations of their heart, and prostrating the body lifted up their
   pure hands and the eyes of their soul to Heaven, seeking by prayer and
   lamentation to reconcile God to them through the Saving Host.

   (3) The first founder and the Spiritual ruler of this notable Community
   was Master Florentius, who was adorned with virtue and filled with
   Divine wisdom and understanding in his knowledge of Christ, because he,
   with his priests and clerks, humbly imitated the manner of the
   Apostolic life. These men, therefore, having one heart and mind in God
   brought every man what was his own into the common stock, and receiving
   simple food and clothing avoided taking thought for the morrow. Of
   their own will they devoted themselves to God and all busied themselves
   in obeying their Rector or his Vicar, and holding holy obedience as the
   highest rule, strove with all their strength to conquer self, to resist
   the passions, and to break down their own will, and besides this they
   sought earnestly to be gravely admonished for any acts of omission and
   neglect. For this reason there was in them much grace and and true
   devotion: and they edified many by their words and example; likewise,
   by patiently abiding the mockery of the world, they led many to despise
   the same, and those who had formerly contemned them and considered
   their life--which was without honour--as a folly, afterward being
   converted to God, and having experienced the grace of devotion, were
   compelled by their consciences to confess openly that these men were
   truly servants and friends of God.

   (4) Many persons therefore, both men and women, despising worldly
   felicity, were converted to the Lord, and were instant to keep His
   commandments and to practise acts of mercy to the poor with Christian
   devotion, relying upon the counsels of the beloved Father Florentius.
   All the Brothers of his Order helped him, holding fast to the Word of
   Life, for they, like the luminaries of Heaven, gave light to a world
   growing old, dwelling in the midst of the turmoil thereof. Some who
   were priests and were learned in their knowledge of the Divine Law,
   preached earnestly in the Church, and by their preaching faithful
   people were wholesomely instructed to the practice of pious deeds and
   the hearing of holy discourses.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II

   Concerning John Gronde

   THERE was in those days at Deventer a devout priest, named John de
   Gronde, who was born in Octmesheim inTwent. This man, well known by
   repute, eloquent as a preacher and pre-eminent amongst the Clergy by
   reason of his character for chastity, was quietly content to serve the
   Altar as a simple Priest.

   For a time he thus lived in the Province of Holland, but then the
   venerable Master Gerard Groote procured that he should be sent to help
   him, writing as follows to the priests who were then earnestly serving
   the Lord in Amsterdam, for he was joined to them by a special bond of
   love: "Be it known to you," said he, "that the township of Deventer
   standeth in urgent need of a good priest to assist the Religious by
   hearing confessions, for we have none such for our need. Wherefore, I
   pray you if there be no serious hindrance to the Holy Church in
   Amsterdam that our beloved John Gronde may be transferred to us from
   you, for doubtless he will be profitable to us; moreover his position
   here will be most suitable to him, since it was for this purpose only
   that he was ordained, namely, to succour those that are truly converted
   to the Lord, for this is the holiest of all tasks, and we shall receive
   him most joyfully and gladly."

   (2) He came, therefore, to Deventer to Master Gerard, and being kindly
   received by him he lived a humble and devout life with the Community,
   dwelling in the ancient House of Florentius with the Brothers who first
   formed that holy Congregation; and being fervent in spirit it was his
   wont to rouse the Brothers to prayer very early in the morning, saying,
   "Arise, watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation." He remained
   in the same house until the death of Master Gerard, after whose happy
   departure he went to the House of the Sisters, and dwelt in Gerard's
   cell. His solemn voice was often heard preaching the Word of God in the
   Church at Deventer, and Florentius was sometimes present, reverently
   hearing his preaching, listening intently and earnestly to the sweet
   and divine discourse which proceeded from his mouth, for his voice was
   sonorous, penetrating the ears of men and piercing their hearts.

   (3) Sometimes also he went to Zwolle to comfort the devout Brothers and
   Sisters. During one season of Lent he often preached there, and once on
   Good Friday he expounded our Lord's Passion in a most earnest manner
   for above six hours, allowing a short interval in the middle of his
   sermon to restore the strength of his hearers. When of his brotherly
   love for them he sojourned at Zwolle, he heard confessions from some of
   the devout, giving wholesome remedies to the penitents, and persuading
   them to abide by their holy resolution, for many were found in that
   place who were eager to serve God, and happily their number has been
   increased until our own time. So anxiously was this devout preacher
   sought after, and so gladly was he heard, that even when he was in the
   Guest Chamber and was sitting at meat he would not deny the Word of
   Salvation to those who sought him, but while he was refreshing the body
   he also administered to them that were heartily contrite medicine to
   heal their souls of those sins which they had confessed to him. In so
   doing indeed he followed the example of Christ, who as He sat at meat
   graciously accepted the penitence of the most blessed Mary Magdalene;
   and when Simon thought wrongfully of the penitent confuted him, and
   directed him aright, giving a wise reason for the pious deed which she
   had done for Him.

   (4) Also he went at times to the Brothers at Mount St. Agnes to hear
   their confessions, for they were at this time poor and had no priest,
   and he said to them: "Let it not seem to you a hard thing to follow a
   God of humility, for by a little toil ye may gain His Kingdom."

   After this he hastened to return to the place of his habitation, being
   unwilling to be separated for long from the beloved Brothers of
   Florentius, for it was his only joy to live with them and they loved
   him with all their hearts. In garb he was simple and in diet temperate,
   he flattered not worldlings for gain's sake, but as a true preacher of
   the Gospel sought an usury of souls and to promote an increase of
   spiritual progress in these devout communities. Therefore, inasmuch as
   he was a faithful minister of the Lord and the day was at hand when he
   should be called to receive an everlasting recompense for his labours,
   he began to be grievously smitten with sickness.

   (5) Thinking he should not live long he had himself carried to the
   House of Florentius desiring to make an end of his days in the midst of
   his Brethren; for he trusted that by their prayers and merits he would
   be greatly holpen at his last hour and faithfully defended from the
   snares of the enemy. And by the mercy of God so it came about, for the
   Most High had compassion upon him, so that he was comforted by the
   presence of Florentius and his Brethren, and at the bidding of the
   beloved Father made an end of his last words by saying: "In the Name of
   the Lord"; and thus he committed to Him the issue of his strife and
   breathed forth the breath of his life early in the morning about the
   fourth hour on the day after the Feast of St. John before the Latin
   gate, namely the 7th of May in the year of the Lord 1392. He was buried
   in the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary by the side of Master Gerard
   and in the same grave, where they both alike repose in peace. This was
   fitting, that as they had loved one another in life, so in death they
   should not be divided, but should be buried in the same Church, and
   beneath the same memorial stone, awaiting the coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ to be raised up again by Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

LIFE OF JOHN BRINCKERINCK

   TO this wrestler in the cause of God there succeeded John Brinckerinck,
   a native of Zutphen, and formerly a loved disciple of Master Gerard.
   When the latter came and preached in divers places Brinckerinck often
   went with him and was his comrade upon the way, just as Luke
   accompanied Paul.

   By this means he heard from Gerard many excellent things and learned of
   him, becoming a devout imitator of his deeds and a credible witness of
   his sanctity; for he came in and went forth with him, recited the
   Hours, and was careful in ministering to him in other pious acts of
   service. After Gerard's happy death, he lived humbly and devoutly under
   obedience to the reverend Father Florentius, being most zealous in
   striving to follow those good principles which he had imbibed with a
   thirsty heart from the preaching of Master Gerard. But by God's
   ordinance he was promoted to the Priesthood, and remained in the
   Community with the Brothers, labouring much in the establishment of the
   first House which Florentius founded until at last when John Gronde had
   died he was placed in charge of the Sisterhood. Being a man of power
   and a zealous lover of Chastity, he ruled the House that was committed
   to him with all strictness, not sparing himself toil, but often
   wearying himself beyond his strength in his efforts to gain souls.
   Sometimes he preached the Word of God in the Church, sternly reproving
   sin, and commending virtue in most excellent wise, as was seemly.

   (2) Twice did I hear him preach upon our Lord's Passion on Good Friday,
   effectually enough and at some length. His first text was "God spared
   not His own Son," the second he took from, the Psalm, "What shall I
   give unto the Lord for all the benefits that He hath bestowed upon me"!

   The Devout heard him gladly, but some worldly men murmured against him
   because he took occasion to denounce their vices; yet he was not made
   fearful by reason of such men, for he loved to speak truth and to
   strive for justice, choosing rather to obey God and to be of profit to
   the good rather than to consent to evil men. Once, therefore, on the
   Feast of the Circumcision he preached very eloquently and persuasively
   upon the Name of Jesus, exalting that sweet and blessed Name above all
   names that are in Heaven and Earth.

   (3) At length his discourse proceeded to denounce certain worldly and
   foolish men on the ground that some, alas! named that Holy and
   Inviolable Name with too little reverence and often even in jest, and
   he cried, saying, "There are some who hearing this Sweet and Blessed
   Name Jesus, say jestingly and in mockery, "Aye, Jesus is the God of the
   Beguines." "Oh! wretched men and fools, what do ye say? Who then is
   your God? Are ye worshippers of the devil that ye call Jesus the God of
   the Béguines? To you this is a great stumbling-block; but to them their
   great honour and their chief joy is this Holy Name of Jesus, Which they
   call upon continually and reverence deeply; and before all and above
   all the names of Saints they love and adore Jesus the Son of God, Whom
   ye mock and despise because these Brethren and Beguines rejoice to call
   upon His Name, devoutly praise It, saluting one another therein. Woe
   unto you! for that ye have the devil's name upon your lips more often
   than that of Jesus because He seemeth to you to be too humble and
   despised!" In so saying he made them that loved Jesus to rejoice, and
   confounded them that mocked Him as they deserved.

   (4) But when the number of the handmaids of God began to be increased,
   John, putting his trust in the help of the Most High, built a larger
   house for them to dwell in, that he might save more souls of them who
   fled to Christ from the turmoil of the world. At length by great labour
   he built a large convent for Devout women outside the city towards the
   north, in which he received certain Sisters from Gerard's house, and
   caused them to be imbued with holy learning, and to be invested in the
   habit of Regulars under perpetual vows. These Sisters, and also those
   who remained in the city, he ruled strictly for the remaining
   twenty-six years of his life, the Lord helping him, but some he sent to
   other places to found new communities. In the beginning he found only
   sixteen Sisters living in the community, but at his death he left
   150--for God multiplied their numbers in his days.

   (5) The words which he spoke to a familiar friend bear witness that he
   thought humbly and fearfully of himself, though he wrought so good a
   work. While they were on the way together and were speaking of the
   future life, he said, "See, Brother, if the Angel of the Lord came to
   me now and said, Bow thy neck, John, and suffer thy head to be cut off
   and thou shalt be in purgatory,' I would gladly submit that I might be
   assured of Salvation and thus be enabled to die in a state of Grace."
   At another time he said in his preaching: "How great and exalted is the
   priestly office, whose dignity scarce any mortal man can worthily
   support! If I could put off the garb of my priesthood as readily as I
   put it on I would straightway unfrock myself here. Let those who make a
   boast of their Holy Orders and pride themselves thereupon, not
   considering the obligations which they incur, give heed to these things
   and learn to think humbly of themselves, and to abase their hearts in
   the fear of God; for every man will be safer before God in the time to
   come in proportion as he is now the humbler in himself."

   (6) This servant of God underwent many labours in his lifetime, and
   suffered scorn and reproach from the envious, but by patience he
   overcame them all, and giving the Glory to God he faithfully finished
   the good work he had begun. The more humbly he thought of himself the
   more pleasing was he to God and the more souls did he draw with him to
   the life of chastity, and so when he had laboured long enough and had
   produced much fruit in the vineyard of the Lord, which God's Right Hand
   had planted, the day grew on to eventide when he should receive the
   reward of his labours and cease from all earthly work, according to the
   Word of the Lord Who said, "Call the labourers and give them their
   hire"; for lo! he fell sick, being seized by a great and violent fever,
   and thinking that he was about to depart he sent word to the Prior of
   Windesheim that he was grievously sick and that the end of his days was
   at hand. And when the Prior came he explained his earnest wishes,
   committing the care of the Sisters to him as unto a faithful steward,
   that he might provide for them in the matter of a suitable Rector, lest
   their new-born zeal for obedience might perish through neglect or
   disuse.

   (7) So the Festival of our Lord's Annunciation dawned and passed, and
   on the next day, i.e., March 26th, John, that faithful servant of
   Christ, panting for a heavenly country, gave up his soul to the God
   Whom from his youth he had striven to serve with the whole strength of
   his body. He died in the year of the Lord 1419, when that reverend Lord
   Frederick de Blanckenheim ruled over the diocese of Utrecht, a noble
   bishop and a pious and renowned patron of all devout persons. He was
   buried in the convent of the Sisters of the Order of Regulars at
   Diepenheim in the middle of the choir before the High Altar which he
   had himself built and consecrated to the honour of the Blessed Virgin
   and St. Agnes.

   Novice

   I gratefully receive what thou sayest; happy is Deventer that she hath
   been adorned by such priests; but I pray thee pursue the way which thou
   hast now begun, and hide not from me those things which I have not yet
   heard.

   The Elder Brother

   The fervency of thy petition doth compel me to narrate certain other
   things which are unknown to thee. Yet how can a mind that is weighed
   down of its own evil tell anything in worthy wise about the virtues of
   men made perfect? But since for love's sake I have begun this task hear
   also what followeth. I will tell my story briefly, lest a lengthy
   discourse cause the reader weariness- Seek not any adornment of style
   in my words, but rather edification of character drawn from the lowly
   conversation of these Devout Brethren.
     __________________________________________________________________

LIFE OF LUBERT BERNER

   Concerning Lubert Berner

   (1)

   AMONGST those who in earlier days gave light to the devout in Deventer
   there shone one Lubert the son of John Berner, a native of Zwolle. He
   was a priest whose character was truly humble and entirely obedient;
   that his life was earnest in Christ is known to me and to divers of the
   Brethren of Windesheim, Mount St. Agnes, and the Fountain of the
   Blessed Virgin near Arnheim, of whom many survive unto this present,
   but some are fallen asleep in the Lord.

   What can I, poor creature that I am, say of so great a man as to whose
   life such a multitude of the devout bear witness? Nay, even men of the
   world, magistrates and councillors, as well as those who at that time
   were canons and vicars at Deventer knew him for a man of great virtue;
   that he was so may be proved by his many acts of humility, some of
   which I will bring forward here as examples, and as it were sweet
   smelling branches sprung from a good tree.

   (2) When this Lubert was in the flower of his youth, and had learned
   the rudiments of the art of grammar, he went with some companions of
   his own age to the University of Prague, and soon having taken his
   Bachelor's degree returned to Zwolle, where his friends received him
   with great joy. Not long afterwards, attracted by the kindliness of the
   Devout Brothers, his heart was softened by the inspiration of God to
   the amending of his life, and resolving to be the servant of Christ he
   retired from the world (but secretly, because his parents and friends
   were opposed to his design) and gladly exchanged worldly pursuits for
   spiritual warfare. He came to Deventer to Florentius, who was then in
   the full vigour of his holy life, and being received with fatherly love
   he learned wholly to renounce the pomps and cares of the world and to
   imitate the lowly life of Christ. He submitted himself beneath the yoke
   of obedience with the fervour of his whole heart, and was zealous in
   taking hold upon the discipline of the new life, and offering himself
   daily as a living sacrifice to God he quickly rose to the highest
   perfection by breaking down his own will.

   (3) But Berner, his father, who was a powerful Councillor at Zwolle,
   took it ill that his son had become a follower of Florentius, and
   turned to so owly a condition of life, so he sent several messengers to
   dissuade Lubert from his holy purpose, thinking that he was utterly
   astray in thus foolishly relinquishing his parents and worldly wealth.
   But Lubert being constant in mind stood unmoved, choosing rather to
   follow the counsel of Christ than to do the will of his earthly father,
   for God is greater than man, and hath bidden us to love Him above all
   things, saying: "He that loveth Father or Mother more than Me is not
   worthy of Me." Meanwhile it happened that his father fell sick, and his
   weakness was very heavy on him so that he could not even speak.
   Therefore Lubert was bidden to come quickly if he desired to see him
   alive; for through God's mercy the father in his utmost need was to
   receive the counsel of salvation through his son. So he went in haste
   to his father's house, to further the salvation of his soul, being
   filled with filial sympathy for his sickness and remembering the
   commandment of the Lord rather than the injury which had been done
   formerly to himself.

   (4) So he who had lately fled before his father's persecution now
   visited him safely when he was sick, and spoke gently to him whose
   opposition he had lately endured; but the father, looking upon his
   beloved son, was greatly rejoiced at the sight of him, and wonderful to
   say, though he had been dumb and unable to open his mouth, he now for
   joy began to speak.

   Forthwith he sought pardon from Lubert and begged him of his mercy to
   forgive him for that he had once sought to hinder him from walking in
   the way of God. And Lubert overflowing with love gladly forgave him
   all. So the father being reconciled unto his son now followed more
   wholesome counsels, and not wishing Lubert to be defrauded of his
   patrimony, ordered all those things to be given him which fell to him
   by the right of succession. These things he set in order during his
   lifetime that after his death he might find mercy from God and be
   effectually assisted by his son's prayers. A few days afterwards he
   died, and Lubert, remembering his kindness, poured forth fervent
   prayers with many tears for him, and he did not take the portion which
   fell to him to be expended upon his own desires but delivered it all
   into the hands of Florentius to be spent in the pious service of the
   Brotherhood.

   Florentius did not keep the goods entrusted to him for his own use but
   laid them out in the building of the House and in paying the expenses
   thereof. This is that Monastery of Florentius, which is distinguished
   by being called after his name and by the favour of the Councillors of
   the State was founded for a Community of Religious Clerks in the year
   1391.

   (5) In the same year Lubert and his friend Henry Brune, who was a
   devout man, were ordained to the priesthood. These two were as twin
   brethren, having been nurtured in that House with the milk of holy
   devotion, and being adorned alike with great virtues were thought
   worthy of the honour of the Priesthood. Both were men who were well
   born as the world judgeth, and as God judgeth pre-eminent for their
   devotion, humble, sober, chaste, kindly, earnest, zealous, loving,
   docile, simple, and obedient.

   (6) Now with regard to Lubert when he had become a priest, I will
   endeavour to describe certain acts of his to serve for examples, and
   these I myself witnessed and have often heard of from the Brothers.
   Once he was sitting in his cell and writing when Florentius sent to
   summon him, and as soon as Lubert received the message he laid down his
   pen and rose from his seat. Now he had reached the last line of the
   page and there were perhaps three or four words remaining to be
   written; so the Brother who was sent with the message said to him:
   "Write that last line and then the page will be finished--thou hast
   time to do so before thou goest." But Lubert in the true spirit of
   obedience, replied: "I must write no more, but obey instantly." Verily
   he was another Mark, and worthy to be rewarded with him of whom it is
   written in the lives of the Fathers that when summoned by his Abbot he
   would not even finish a letter which he had begun. When his business
   with Florentius was done Lubert returned to finish his work filled with
   the joy of a good conscience as the fruit of his obedience. Then the
   other Brother told in order all that had happened to Florentius, who
   hearing of the prompt obedience of Lubert, praised him thus, saying:
   "Lubert, Lubert, how well thou knowest what is for thy profit and thy
   spiritual progress." So diligent was he in writing that when anyone
   spoke to him he continued his task while making a fitting reply.

   (7) At another time a scholar who wished to write a letter to his
   parents was doing so by Lubert's advice in his cell, and I was present
   with them. Then Florentius came in and said: "What do ye?" and Lubert
   answered with respect, "My companion is writing a letter to his
   parents," to which that most kindly Father replied: "Write on, that thy
   name may be written down for Life Eternal." The young man aforesaid
   afterward became a devout Religious. Neither do I forget the words of
   my Father Florentius which he spoke in Lubert's cell, for a good man
   out of the good treasure of his heart ever bringeth forth good things.
   Florentius was instant to speak that which should tend to edification,
   and Lubert his disciple strove not to neglect aught which might fall
   from his master's mouth, but to fulfil his commands without hesitation.

   (8) One of the Devout asked leave of Florentius to visit his friends
   and relations, and as his request was urgent Florentius gave him
   permission, not wishing to make him sad. When he returned from his
   journey, having met with many perils on the way, he came to Lubert, the
   servant of Christ, and said: "I wonder that Father Florentius so
   readily gave me leave to revisit mine own country, since so many
   dangers meet a man in the world," and Lubert answered: "If Father
   Florentius had known that thou wert strong enough and able to submit
   thy whole will to his good pleasure he would have spoken otherwise to
   thee. But he condescended to thy petition and desire from love of thee,
   lest of thine own motion thou shouldst venture upon something even
   worse. The blame therefore resteth with thee and not with him for his
   consent.'' Then that other replied: "It is good for me to know this,
   and for the future I will look to it more carefully that I do what I am
   told, following the counsel of him that hath the governance of me; "for
   he acts foolishly who doth follow his own desires against the good
   pleasure of his superior, as is shown in this instance, and the
   experience of many doth bear a like testimony.

   Novice

   (9) I gladly hear of these patterns of holy obedience; God grant that
   being taught by this example I may for the future beware of being
   satisfied with mine own judgement, and may always incline myself to
   obey my Superior. But besides these things I would hear somewhat of the
   humility of this devout man, for if he had not been humble he would not
   have obeyed so quickly.

   The Elder Brother

   (10) It is fitting that I should tell thee somewhat of this matter, for
   to consent to one who for a pious purpose doth make such a request,
   doth tend to edification and doth gain favour in no small measure with
   the Almighty.

   This Lubert of happy memory was indeed humble, humble in heart, in
   garb, in deed, and in word, as the following instances shall show. He
   was wont to praise the virtues of others somewhat highly, to think
   himself of less account than any, and to speak with the poor and simple
   rather than with the rich. Wherefore when a certain Clerk came and
   asked him to give him some good counsel for the amending of his life,
   Lubert replied: "Good Brother, what can I, a slothful and profitless
   man, say to thee! Go to that Brother yonder, and he shall instruct thee
   better. For I am like a vessel made to dishonour which may never be
   washed clean, but must ever send forth a foul savour."

   The Brother hearing this went away much edified and said to his
   companions: "How humble a man is Lubert!"

   (11) There were two Clerks talking to one another of Lubert, and one of
   them said: "I think that he weareth too austere an aspect; gladly would
   I speak to him sometimes but I dare not;" to which the other answered:
   "If it seem good to thee I will tell him of it and perchance he may
   amend himself." The Clerk therefore came to Lubert, and said: "I would
   fain have some talk with thee," and Lubert said, "Say on." Then that
   other said to him: "Some are offended in thee because thou dost walk
   with such austerity, and dost look sourly upon them, wherefore they
   dare not to approach thee and speak with thee. I pray thee be more
   complaisant and kindly affectionate in thy manner of speech that they
   may come freely to thee." Then the humble Lubert answered: "Most gladly
   will I amend myself through the Grace of God, and I thank thee that
   thou hast admonished me." From that hour he was as it were another man,
   and he looked more cheerfully upon those who approached him, though he
   maintained a due and proper gravity.

   (12) Once when the Brothers were gathered together, Florentius
   questioned them concerning a certain matter in the Holy Scriptures, and
   as the others were silent, Lubert, because he was the eldest amongst
   them, began to speak. But Florentius, who wished to humble him before
   them and to prove his spirit, said, with a grave air: "Thinkest thou
   that we are ignorant of what thou sayest we who are Bachelors and
   Masters in Arts?" and Lubert humbly replied: "I was presumptuous;" for
   this was his wont when he was reproved for any small fault, that he did
   not excuse himself, but rather confessed himself to be blameworthy,
   saying; "I was in fault," or "negligent," or "careless," or "foolish,"
   or "stupid," or "idle," or something of the like nature; confessions
   which proclaimed his own humility and edified the Brothers.

   (13) When he read aloud during meal time he would make mistakes of set
   purpose that he might be corrected by the Brother whose duty it was to
   do so, and sometimes he pretended not to have heard that he might be
   corrected yet more fully, for he desired to be put to confusion and to
   be held a dullard for not being able to read better. But Gerard of
   Zutphen, whose duty it was to correct such errors at meal-time,
   perceiving that his mistakes arose not through ignorance only but
   through his virtue of humility, abstained from correcting him a second
   time. He had a manly voice as of a trumpet, and read in very seemly
   wise.

   (14) One of the Brothers asked Florentius this question: "Why dost thou
   not reprove me and chasten me as thou dost Lubert and John Ketel our
   cook? Would it not be good for me that thou shouldest sometimes so
   chasten and reproach me?" But the good Father, filled with the virtue
   of sound judgement, answered: "If I knew that thou wert as strong for
   all good as they I would prove thee in like manner: but these two are
   of such a character that through reproof they go forward yet further
   and do not murmur against it, but become thereby yet more humble and
   fervent in spirit. For they rejoice in being despised and in bearing
   blame beyond all others." The beloved Father would often reproach them
   to their faces before the other Brothers, for although he admonished
   them severely so as to set an example to the rest, yet he deeply loved
   them, as he showed particularly by the many tears he shed at the time
   of their death.

   (15) So to this Lubert as a good and wise man, virtue was truly of a
   pleasant savour, and the passions and concupiscence of the flesh were
   things to shudder at, for he strove to overcome the frowardness of his
   nature, and in like manner he stirred up others to fight manfully
   against their sins.

   (16) Once when he was speaking devoutly and earnestly with certain of
   the Brothers about conquering the passions, they communed together
   almost until the middle of the night. Their hearts were so kindled with
   the love of God and the desire to amend their lives that they forgot
   themselves and did not perceive the mist of sleep but put away
   heaviness from them, being aroused to new devotion by their ardent
   conversation about the Word of God; for they proved by their own
   experience the truth of that verse of the Psalmist: "Thy word doth burn
   vehemently and thy servant loveth it."

   By thus communing together of holy things, Lubert and those who were
   summoned with him to advance in the Spiritual Life were greatly
   inflamed, so that afterward he would say joyfully and longingly repeat
   to the Brothers who were his comrades in arms: "When! oh! when can we
   set ourselves aflame once more!"

   Novice

   (17) By telling me this thou dost excite my admiration. Would that I
   could hear continually of such matters which should pierce my heart to
   my healing, and enkindle me. Would that no vain talking might interpose
   to defile my conscience! But I pray set forth some other examples from
   the life of this noble priest to teach me to avoid scurrilous talk, for
   I confess that it is no small joy to hear of their devout communing.

   The Elder Brother

   (18) Our Saviour Jesus Christ saith: "He that is of God heareth God's
   word," and since thou dost rejoice to hear and read the things that are
   of good report concerning the servants of God, I hope this cometh of
   Divine grace, which thou oughtest to guard with all diligence, and to
   incline thine heart continually to humility and virtue, which things
   were deeply rooted in Lubert. Once when he was standing near the
   kitchen grinding mustard, some of his friends from Zwolle came desiring
   to visit him; and when he saw them he was moved to speak to them lest
   perchance they might be offended if they were baulked of their desire
   to talk with him--for they were honourable men and had been appointed
   to the Magistracy. So the humble Lubert, just as he was, girt with his
   apron, approached and saluted his friends lovingly, not being ashamed
   to appear before them in the dress of a servant, but rather striving to
   please God by discharging a humble office. After talking with them for
   a short while he bade them farewell and returned to the task imposed
   upon him, and his friends went away much edified by his humility.

   (19) At another time, when he was at Zwolle, some friends were walking
   with him and they were handsomely clad, but he was dressed plainly in
   his long habit as a simple Brother should be. And some who saw this
   said admiringly: "See how he goeth like a lamb in the midst of wolves."
   Thus to compare them was fitting, for their lives were utterly diverse.
   Once, in summer time, he was given a plain gray hood, old and faded,
   and Brother Amilius, who was very friendly with him and loved him well,
   said, to prove him: "Lubert, what manner of hood is that which thou
   hast? it doth become thee ill enough, for it doth hang about thy neck
   as if thou wert in a consumption." And Lubert replied cheerfully: "My
   Brother, what art thou saying? feel it and see how good the cloth is,
   and do not speak evil of it for I am not worthy to wear it." So Amilius
   hearing this was edified by his words.

   (20) Amilius also told me the things following, concerning Lubert,
   saying: "He was so humble, and mortified his own will so much, that he
   would submit even to a little child, and obey the least of the Brothers
   in the House as gladly as he obeyed Florentius himself, if the latter
   placed such an one in charge of the House. He was of none account and
   an outcast in his own eyes, so he thought the more highly of others,
   especially those who served the Brothers in the kitchen. He used to
   say: "John Kettel and his companion go far beyond us in virtue, and
   they will yet become our superiors, for they put us to shame for our
   lukewarmness and themselves do their work with all zeal. They seem to
   be our servants but in very truth they are our Lords and Masters in the
   Way of God." It was out of the humility of his heart that he said this
   and so instructed himself and others in most excellent wise. He had a
   good knowledge of writing and rejoiced to exercise this art, for he
   shunned sloth and was instant and diligent in the labour of his hands,
   and in inducing others to write.

   (21) Once when a boy asked him to set a copy he consented kindly, and
   did it, saying: "Thou wilt learn to be a good writer, for thou hast
   long and pliant fingers": and by the co-operation of God this prophecy
   was fulfilled. He wrote in round hand these words as a copy and as a
   good motto: "Take my yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and
   lowly of heart. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light

   These words had the savour of true wisdom to him, wherefore he put
   aside the sayings of the philosophers and exhorted his pupil to follow
   the humility of Christ which leadeth a man to true wisdom and to the
   attainment of everlasting felicity. When therefore this humble and
   devout priest Lubert, surnamed ten Bosche, who is famed for his many
   virtues, was about to depart from this present world, he earnestly
   besought the Brothers to remember him in their prayers after his death
   by saying sometimes the prayer for the departed, especially at the time
   when they were writing in their cells.

   (22) When the deadly plague was raging grievously in Deventer and the
   neighbouring places, and had taken away several of the Devout besides
   others from this life, and had (as one may piously believe) given them
   part in Eternal Light in Heaven, it so fell out that Lubert also was
   seized with the said plague. In the month of July, three days before
   the Feast of the Blessed Mary Magdalene, he began to be sick and to
   keep his bed, saying that he should not abide here long. The Brothers
   laboured on his behalf with many prayers and sought means of healing
   him from God, and from skilful chirurgeons, for all desired that he
   might live. But his prayer ascending to the ears of Those that dwell in
   Heaven availed more than the longing of the Brothers, so when one of
   them said: "We shall not long be separated but shall soon hold commune
   again in Florentius' cell," he replied: "Never again in this world, but
   in Heaven and with the Saints," for he desired to be released and to be
   with Christ. So on the Feast of the Blessed Mary Magdalene he bade them
   sing in his presence the sequence "Laus tibi Christe," and when they
   had sung it he said: "What devout and fervent words are those"; and he
   repeated this verse to himself meditatively: "What should the sick soul
   do if she had received no help, and if there were no physician there?"
   Many devout persons who were present hearing this wept, but he being
   joyful in the Lord consoled their grief.

   (23) Brother Amilius, who was assiduous in ministering to him,
   carefully kept account of all the edifying words which he heard fall
   from his lips; and after Lubert's death he faithfully made record of
   them, writing them in order in a letter which he sent to the Brothers
   who were absent; and this letter I have determined to insert here as a
   pious memorial of Lubert that thereby his happy death, and the last
   moments of his life maybe more fully known. When about eight days had
   elapsed since the beginning of his sickness and he grew no better, at
   length wearied by his many sufferings he reached his last hour, and
   filled with divine comfort he fell asleep in the Lord joyfully and
   happily, surrounded by the Brothers, who kept watch over his death-bed
   with earnest prayers. He died on the twenty-sixth of July, the day
   following the Feast of St. James the Apostle, in the year of our Lord's
   Incarnation, 1398, during the reign of Pope Boniface the Ninth. His
   body was reverently buried in the churchyard of St. Lebuin, near that
   of his companion John Ketel--that devout servant of Christ--toward the
   southern side of the church. There several other Brothers, who died as
   time went on, were buried near him, and there they rest in peace.

   An account of Lubert's happy death written by the beloved Brother
   Amilius

   (24) In the Name of the Lord Amen. In the year 1398, after our Lord's
   Nativity, and on July the nineteenth, Lubert ten Bosche--that is Lubert
   of the Wood or Forest--an humble priest, and a man of great devotion,
   was seized with the plague. The first two or three days after his
   seizure he spent upon his bed in sleep or stupor without consciousness,
   as usually occurs in this disease, and during this time he became so
   weak as to seem very near to death. Afterwards, however, he grew easier
   and seemed to those who stood by to be like to get better; but he so
   bore himself as one that had a certain knowledge that he should die,
   for to some he offered consolation and said farewell to others.
   Likewise he dictated several letters to his familiar friends who were
   Priests and Religious scattered about in divers places, praying them
   that, since he was passing to Purgatory and the place of suffering,
   they would help him with their Masses, watchings and prayers. Then he
   desired that the Brothers of our House might be assembled, saying that
   he thought it profitable and fitting that he should make his peace with
   those with whom he had lived during so many years, and should ask their
   pardon and forgiveness, and so depart. So when they were gathered
   together he stood near, leaning upon the staff which supported him, and
   began thus:

   "I have dwelt for so many years in the House of Florentius and yet have
   amended my life too little, nor have I made that progress in virtue
   which I set before me when I came hither. My whole intent and
   resolution was willingly to give myself to all humiliation, obedience,
   lowliness, charity, and the other virtues, and to submit to Florentius
   and all the Brothers; but I have not so done as--now that I am about to
   die--I should rejoice to have done. Nay! I have often been a stone of
   stumbling and a rock of offence to you by my pride;" and here he
   mentioned various other sins of which in his humility he accused
   himself.

   (25) Then, weak as he was, he most humbly prostrated himself upon the
   earth, and with much humility and tears besought pardon from them all.
   Who could be so hard of heart as to refrain from tears to see so great
   a man, a Father and Brother so loving, thus prostrate on the ground and
   weeping! Then rising and leaning upon his staff he began once more to
   address the Brothers, exhorting them faithfully and lovingly to keep
   their unity and charity to one another, and to strive continually to
   submit themselves, and to be subject one to the other in that obedience
   that is of love; and he urged each one to strive to be the least of all
   and the servant of all, to be faithful guardians to one another,
   admonishing one another in charity, correcting one another for sin and
   evil manners in brotherly love, not passing over or approving any sin
   either of commission or omission; so should they attain true unity and
   charity by the rooting out of sin. He added, "If ye thus remain at
   unity, and thus act, ye shall have nought to fear from any man, and
   shall be like to a fenced city which may not be taken, otherwise your
   affairs shall quickly come to nought, and all your strivings shall be
   nothing accounted of, but become as it were vanity and foolishness."
   After this he humbly besought the Brothers to pray for him in faith,
   and to remember him in all their prayers as he had confidence therein
   but particularly in those supplications wherein they exercised
   themselves during the daily labour of their hands; and so saying
   farewell to the Brothers he let them go, On the second day he dictated
   a letter in the following terms to be sent to Florentius and the other
   Brothers who were absent.

   The letter of the devout and humble Lubert to Florentius

   (26) Peace of mind and every good thing be with thee; Most beloved
   Father, I believe that our dear Brother Amilius hath written to thee
   concerning my sickness, yet I write to inform thee further that from
   the Friday when I fell sick until the following Tuesday I lay in stupor
   and unconscious, unable to turn myself upon my bed; but now since the
   Lord hath of His goodness rekindled my poor intelligence in some
   measure I cannot depart in peace out of this misery without once more
   at least--and for the last time in this life--prostrating myself at thy
   feet and unfolding to thee as to my father my sufferings and the
   endless pressure of necessity which doth particularly beset me. For now
   I must be brought before the dreadful Judgement Seat of God, in the
   presence of His Angels and of them that are our especial Advocates,
   confounded by those sins for the amendment of which thou hast often
   instructed me. But I, alas! did not think of those sins as thou didst
   judge them, nor perceive how grievous and terrible they are. Oh! Father
   Florentius, I cannot before the Judgement Seat of God deny what thine
   own hand hath written to me concerning my passions, yet in some measure
   it was I myself who by many importunate prayers constrained thee to
   write. This document I have entrusted to our beloved Amilius to be laid
   before thee, that considering these and my other offences thou mayest
   think the more pitifully of the sufferings I must undergo in that place
   of dread, that place of direful pains, and mayest succour me by thy
   prayers, of which I stand in urgent need.

   Most beloved Father, if I were in thy presence I would entreat thee
   with tears to grant me true and fatherly pardon for other offences, and
   especially my disobedience, lest I be condemned yet more dreadfully for
   these sins, and I doubt not that thou wouldest freely pardon me.

   (27) Now I will speak to you, most beloved Brothers, for by your life
   and conversation ye have often recalled me from my lukewarmness and
   sloth to the amending of my life, and often have most lovingly
   admonished me for my passions; but--as ye know--I, wretched man that I
   am! have not amended as much as I might and ought to have done, nor
   could your words pierce the hardness of my heart which would have been
   for my good, for I knew not nor foresaw that as I had so lived in this
   life, I must therefore be taken suddenly to the place of dreadful
   pains, where are gnawing serpents, fierce lions, ravening wolves, and
   countless monstrous devils. If I can repay you for all your
   exhortations and good example I will never be backward in so doing; but
   this I cannot do, for whatever small progress I may have made in this
   life I have made it by the help of God and of you, and I ascribe it not
   to myself. And now for all my sins of neglect I prostrate myself before
   your feet with heart and lips accusing myself before God and you, and
   praying for pardon for every one of them.

   Likewise I beseech you that ye see to it that the day of my death be
   announced to those persons whom ye see fit to tell, though I know that
   ye will not fail in this, and that ye cause the Holy Office to be said
   and Vigil to be kept, with such other observances as may seem good to
   you. Farewell! Farewell! and again Farewell for ever! all ye whom in
   this life I shall see no more.

   (28) Having dictated this letter on the Vigil of St. James the Apostle
   he sat down to read it again if perchance there might be aught that he
   wished to add or remove from it, but suddenly there came upon him such
   trembling and weakness that all his strength went from him, so they
   that stood by took him back and laid him again upon his bed. Soon
   afterward he began to be so shaken with violent pain and distress that
   he cried aloud with a lamentable and pitiful voice and asked that the
   Brothers of the House and other devout persons from without should be
   called together to succour him with their prayers. And when they were
   so called his breast began io quake and his whole body trembled and was
   violently shaken, he grew pale and sweated; and his eyes were distorted
   in dreadful wise, he groaned and gnashed with his teeth, uttering moans
   of distress and other pitiable sounds. Meantime the Devout ran together
   and with many tears prayed earnestly for him, and he, beholding them,
   also wept some little space.

   (29) Then he signed to me, Amilius, for I was continually with him, to
   take away the taper which we had placed in his hand supposing him to be
   at the point to die, and to read the Seven Psalms with him, for he
   thought that he should not die yet. So he began reading one verse with
   me while the other Brothers responded with the remainder, and thus he
   continued to the end with great fervour and devotion: and when the
   Psalms were ended he said "Let us abide under the protection of Holy
   Mary," so he began the "Salve Regina" and the proper collects, and this
   Antiphon he repeated again and again with great love and devotion;
   saying the Collect and often changing the words, led thereto by these
   emotions. From time to time the power of speech failed him, but he
   continually began again the same Antiphon that the others might repeat
   it throughout. When this had continued for a time he bade me tell the
   Brothers to pray silently and with heartfelt compunction for him, and
   then he lay for a long time speechless and as it would seem in great
   pain and distress. But the Devout and the Brothers remained with him
   all day in prayer looking for his death from hour to hour. Having lain
   thus for a long time he called me, saying, "Brother Amilius, the power
   of speech hath been restored to me. Therefore tell the Brothers and all
   the Devout every one of them to recite the Psalter for me, and at the
   beginning and end of every Psalm to say one Ave Maria' on bended
   knees." Afterward he said, "Tell them that I care not for a great
   number of Psalms, let them wait awhile between the several Psalms in
   meditation and pray the Lord for me with heartfelt compunction lest
   their minds be confused by the number of Psalms which they recite."
   When I had told them this he bade me ask all that were gathered
   together to pray for him, saying the Seven Psalms, the Hours of Our
   Lady, and of the Holy Spirit, and anything else they could repeat,
   continuing constantly in prayer with him, and so to abide until his
   death; and when I had given them this direction he added: "Brother, I
   fear that I am laying a heavy burden upon our Brothers and Sisters, but
   necessity doth constrain me, for I cannot trust at all in myself, but
   lean greatly upon the prayers of the Devout. How seemeth it to you?"
   And I comforted him, bidding him be of good cheer, for they would most
   gladly do this for him. Then from the hour of Vespers or thereabouts
   until the eighth hour he lay speechless in a great fever and then began
   to speak again and became quite peaceful.

   (30) After awhile he called me to him and told me how he had fared
   during the day; at first he said he had suffered great and wonderful
   temptations, for there had come to him an evil spirit in the form of
   our Brother John Ketel which strove with many devices to deceive him.
   This spirit told him many marvellous things about the Glory of Heaven
   and divers subtle and high matters, many of which were true and
   conformable to the Scriptures, but therewith it mingled many things
   that were false. It also told him many marvels which he could not
   explain for its manner of speech was, he said, that of a spirit, and it
   seemed to be conjoined to his own soul so that it was as it were
   talking with himself and his own soul answered him. "It was," said he,
   "very displeasing to this Spirit that I spoke to you from time to time,
   for when I would do so the Spirit said to me, "Speak not to the flesh,
   speak not to the flesh." It was also much displeased that I had
   procured so many prayers to be offered up by the Devout, and that I had
   such confidence therein. And when I asked you to read the Psalms the
   Spirit said within me, "Dross, Dross! why puttest thou thy trust in
   these Psalms? or in Mary, Gregory, Jerome, and the like? Thou oughtest
   to put thy trust in God; He is angry with thee that thou trustest in
   these rather than in Him only--yet because thou art fainthearted and
   fearful, and hast not done this of malice, He is merciful to thee; but
   take heed that thou do this no more. I, John Ketel, did not thus, yet
   have I reached the Kingdom of Heaven without passing through
   Purgatory:" and when I asked why this was so he gave the two following
   reasons.

   (31) The first was that he had renounced all temporal goods and riches
   altogether, for the sake of God and the Salvation of his own soul, and
   had given himself to so lowly a station in life (i.e. the work of the
   kitchen), and had never repented of this renunciation. The second
   reason was that he had eagerly and zealously persevered in such work
   without any desire to return to his former state; and also because he
   had shown a firm resolution and great zeal to abide until his death in
   a condition so humble and in an office so lowly (for this he did that
   he might be the servant of all), and had in fact continued until his
   death in that office as he had resolved. Then Lubert said to me:
   "Brother, I know that what the evil spirit told me of our trusty and
   beloved Brother John Ketel was true, but whether or no he hath come to
   the Kingdom of Heaven without passing through Purgatory I know not.
   That evil spirit told me (added he) that I also should escape Purgatory
   and pass to the Kingdom of Heaven, and when I asked the cause hereof,
   it said: "Thou art a martyr in the sight of God, because thou hast laid
   down thy life for thy Brethren and Sisters in that of thy love and
   charity thou hast chosen to remain with them in so great danger of
   death." Then the humble Lubert said to me: "Whether I shall go to
   Heaven, escaping Purgatory, I know not, though I cannot deny that I
   abode with my Brethren out of love and charity to them; yet it is
   enough that the spirit strove with many words to induce me to trust in
   mine own merits and virtue; yet I have been ever fearful and have never
   trusted in myself, nor do I now so trust--all my confidence and hope is
   in the mercy of God, in the intercessions and merits of the glorious
   Virgin and the other Saints, and in the prayers of the Devout,
   wherefore I do rejoice and am glad that many holy psalms and prayers
   have been said. Sometimes the spirit took away from me all my senses
   save that of hearing, and this too he strove to take away, but was not
   able."

   Besides this Lubert told me of many marvellous things which the Devil
   had said to him, of which some were heretical and contrary to the
   Faith, and to these strove to persuade Lubert to assent, but he mingled
   with his lies some things that are true. "By these proofs I know," said
   Lubert, "that it was a wicked spirit which was trying to deceive me,
   because it ever mingled falsehood and lies with the truth. It doth
   appear to me, therefore, that it is profitable and necessary for one
   who is dying to have some man of understanding--like my Brothers--at
   his side until his departure." These things he told me on the Vigil of
   St. James the Apostle after the eighth hour in the evening.

   (32) After this, weak as he was, he continued in great tranquillity and
   peace of heart until his death, for he earnestly desired to be released
   and to be with Christ, having a sure confidence and hope in the coming
   of our Lord Jesus, the glorious Virgin Mary and the other Saints. In
   this ardent longing he continued until the day after the Feast of St.
   James, sighing and pondering over the Holy Psalms, especially the Psalm
   of "Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way." He often asked how
   near he was to death, whether he showed the signs thereof, whether his
   short breathing did not portend death, and so forth: and we could give
   him no better comfort than to tell him the end was near at hand.

   (33) Sometimes he cried out, but with great trustfulness: "O when will
   the Lord Jesus and Holy Mary with the Holy Angels come to release me? I
   trust that they will not delay their coming. Would that they might
   deign to come quickly and to make an end! I hope that I shall not long
   abide here," and so forth. Very often he evoked Holy Mary, Jerome, and
   Gregory (for to these he was especially devoted) and other Saints to
   pray for him, to be present with him, and succour him in the hour of
   death. He besought us also to speak a few words to him from time to
   time and urge him to prayer and to the Invocation of Saints;. but for
   the rest to pray for him in silence, with sighing and tears, and to
   await his death with him, having our hearts repentant toward the Lord.
   Thus he came to his last hour, so fervent, so devoted, so ardently
   desiring to be released, so lovingly and confidently awaiting the
   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Virgin Mary,, the Holy
   Angels, and the other saints--nor, as it would seem, was he baulked of
   his desire.

   (34) By this time he was already dead and quite cold in all his other
   members, and life seemed to flutter only in his tongue and breast, for
   there was scarce one of his limbs that he could move; but suddenly,
   without help from any one, he raised himself up by his own motion and
   clasped his hands and lifted them upward, keeping his eyes fixed upon
   the wall, toward which he most reverently bowed his head with all
   devotion, and he lifted up his hoarse and broken voice, and cried with
   all the strength he had: "Of Thy Glory, Thy goodness, Thy mercy,
   receive, oh! receive me! Of Thy Glory, Thy Glory, Thy goodness, Thy
   goodness, of Thy mercy, receive me, receive me, oh! receive me." While
   he sat upright he repeated these words again and again, and at length
   laid him down upon his bed, but twice afterward he raised himself again
   with the same motions and gestures, and repeated the same words. And
   again he sank back and lay seemingly in a deep stupor and amazement,
   but I asked him, saying: "Brother Lubert, what is it?" "How is it with
   thee?" and he answered me, as it were in great amazement: "Wonderful,
   wonderful, marvellous, marvellous, yea, great and marvellous are the
   things which I saw when I sat up;" and then he added, "Call the
   Brothers, call the Brothers," and, when I called them, immediately he
   breathed his last, after a short struggle, and fell asleep happily in
   the Lord, full of virtue and good works, for whom Blessed be God! for
   ever and ever, Amen.

   From a letter of Florentius in praise of Lubert

   (35) Who that knew our beloved Brother Lubert would not grieve for his
   death? who that loved him would not weep? who would not mourn and
   lament for our House if he diligently considered what ruin and calamity
   that death doth threaten thereto? What an example of humility, what a
   pattern of devotion to the Community was taken from us when he died! Is
   any one of us who survive so fervent in all the exercises of devotion
   and contempt for the world? doth any promote the common good as did
   Lubert? is any consumed by godly zeal for our House as he was? Is there
   any that doth so esteem himself as worthless, lacking in wisdom,
   insufficient? a pattern of all these virtues hath been taken from us by
   his death; for this cause it is just that he who loveth our House
   should mourn piously for him; for this cause he doth weep that is
   solicitous for our progress in spiritual things, and our grief doth
   bear proportion to the love we felt for him, for the more closely our
   hearts were knitted to him the more bitterly do they feel this
   severance. Verily our heart and soul were at one in the Lord with our
   most beloved Brother: judge ye therefore from that unity what the pain
   of severance is, and take the measure of our sadness by the abundance
   of our love. But if ye desire a brief and clear proof of the measure of
   that sadness and that pain which were so heavy and so grievous that we
   could scarce read two or three lines of your letter, or write two or
   three in reply thereto without shedding tears in such abundance as to
   hinder us from continuing; if, I say, ye would know the measure of our
   grief and sadness search the depths of your own hearts, all ye who
   loved Lubert even as we loved him!

   Certain excerpts taken from the devout exercises of Lubert

   (36) Thy task shall be to labour to uproot thy vices, and to gain
   virtue; but unless thou dost resign thyself to God simply and with all
   thy heart, committing all else to him, it will rather engender
   presumption in thee, making thee hard of heart, doubtful, restless and
   cowardly. Labour therefore with modesty, quietness and fear, but resign
   and commit the issue to God that He may do according as He will. Be not
   sad nor downcast if thou art not able to fulfil thy purpose, for it may
   be that God doth will it so lest thou shouldest trust in thine own
   virtue.

   When thou prayest have no thought save of God and thy Psalmody,
   considering that He seeth thee. Give up thy will freely and wholly to
   Him, and utterly put aside, so far as thou art able, all unnecessary
   and empty thoughts. Strive so to behave thyself as if thou wert
   standing alone in the Presence of God, the Blessed Virgin and all the
   Saints; to Them show thy necessities and the wounds of thy soul.

   When thou dost pray, or talk, or wheresoever thou art, let not thy
   thoughts dwell upon the Brothers--or any others who may be present--for
   to do so doth greatly distract thy thoughts from thyself, doth dissolve
   the virtue of thy mind, doth make thee bitter and suspicious, doth
   darken thine understanding, doth engender forgetfulness of God and love
   for the applause of men; doth befog the mind and disturb the
   conscience. Keep thy heart at peace and turned away from shadows and
   from sin, but turned toward God.

   (37) Let thine aspect be like that of the other Brothers, neither too
   severe, nor ostentatiously cheerful, and so continue to comport thyself
   when thou art alone within thy cell; and if in anything that thou doest
   thou art inclined to comport thyself otherwise, strive to amend in
   this; so shalt thou always do the will of God with a quiet mind, shalt
   guard thyself from thy vices and continue at all times cheerful.

   In every way and in all things beware of acting hastily, but do
   everything deliberately and without ostentation. Thou shouldest never
   speak harshly to any, nor bring a railing or derisive accusation
   against any, but rather implore and admonish him as charity doth
   demand.

   Whenever thou art disquieted in mind bear patiently and quietly those
   things that are contrary to thy nature and disposition, but for the
   time being strive not to hinder nor do anything at all in that matter
   about which thou art disquieted beyond reason; wait rather until God's
   grace and thy peace of mind return, and meanwhile flee to thy cell and
   to prayer because thou art weak and beset, and think "In your patience
   ye shall possess your souls." From time to time choose to be alone, to
   labour with thine hands, to pray patiently, and to act without
   unreasoning haste. Always choose such matters for thy meditation about
   God and the Holy Scriptures as shall kindle thee to the Love and Fear
   of God or to horror for thy vices.

   (38) Whatsoever thou doest in temporal matters, give not too much heed
   to appearance and outward show, but aim at doing the Will of God only
   and commit everything to Him.

   Turn away thy heart and thine eyes from men; be constant to that which
   is within and forget that which is without: reach out to heaven with
   prayer, sighs, study and repentance, and whet thy mind continually upon
   these. Avoid ostentation and presumption, and put away the images of
   men from thy heart.

   All virtue, all progress, doth consist in this, to follow the Will of
   God and to please Him.

   Strive for this that thine intention may be toward God and according to
   His will, and cast away the passions of thy soul.

   Take this as a rule that cannot misguide thee: whatsoever our Father
   Florentius and the Brethren may determine, that is God's will for thee
   to do, for He doth dwell in them and they seek nothing save His
   pleasure.

   Do everything as Florentius shall advise:--and if he is absent act in
   like manner by the counsel of Gerard in all things as if it were the
   counsel of God; for Gerard is far wiser, more humble, more prudent,
   more spiritual, more thoughtful than thou art, and his acts are more in
   accord with the Will of God than are thine.

   Thou shouldest be very careful to avoid the occasion of sin. Often when
   thou art at peace thou seemest to thyself to be somewhat, but when thou
   dost mingle with outward things that which was hidden in thee cometh to
   light--for this thou oughtest deeply to abase thyself. Much talking
   doth take a man away from himself, leadeth him into ignorance, taketh
   away his forethought, and doth bring forth confusion. Therefore it is
   needful for one who is disposed to much speaking to meditate often, and
   pause or check himself so as to think whether what he shall say shall
   be pleasing to God or whether it shall tend to boastfulness, love for
   the praise of men and vain-glory.

   For thy words, look to it that they be such as are necessary, pious and
   profitable; but before all things that they be in accordance with the
   Will of God. Thou mayest by no means speak loosely nor by thy words
   incite others thereto.

   (39) Never speak hastily and mockingly to a man of his faults before
   others, for to do this is a sign of pride and presumption, and is an
   ill example to others.

   Learn to talk little, to use but few words, and to speak with
   forethought. Wait while others speak, and be careful lest thou listen
   to aught that may do thee hurt.

   Sift also the words of every man to find whether they be true or
   slanderous.

   Be firmly resolved by the Grace of God not to speak of the evil deeds
   of any, nor willingly to hear of them save to some good purpose, and
   even then be cautious lest thou be led astray.

   Let it be thy habit not to pour out thy heart too earnestly upon
   anything whatsoever, whether it be a temporal or whether it be a
   spiritual matter; but always hold back modestly in fear of thine own
   vices. Go forward with discretion and step by step; advance in due
   season and never altogether retreat, but keep thy heart sustained by
   the Word of God and so bent backward as to hold in check all thy vices
   in general, but especially any one vice which for the time thou dost
   particularly fear. Thus, by God's grace, with due moderation and mature
   thought as in His sight, speak and do whatsoever thou thinkest shall
   please Him.

   In thine eating avoid greed and gluttony; rather restrain thine
   appetite, that the blind and confused desires of nature may be
   enlightened by repentance and by a hunger to hear the reading. Take
   some portion of the reading and as it were ruminate thereon, or
   similarly that portion of Scripture, "A certain man made a great
   supper." If at any time thou art disordered or oppressed in the head
   after eating, then flee to thy cell, or by talking awhile with other
   men, strive for the future to be more cautious in keeping guard over
   thyself; yet to pray and flee is safer. "Happy is the man that feareth
   alway;" and know this in very truth, that when in place of being afraid
   thou dost fall into security, thou fallest away from God and art led
   captive by devils and by thine own passions. Yet thou oughtest to fear
   in such a manner as shall make thee trust the more in God; the weaker
   thou seemest to thyself the stronger shall He make thee. Therefore it
   is good rather to trust others and to be fearful for thyself. In the
   things of God learn virtue and conduct from others, and fear to boast
   thyself;--for thy sake Christ became a learner; for thy sake He held
   His peace.

   (40) Learn to remain within and to live the common social life amid the
   Brethren and the rest, and think highly of them; consider their virtues
   and thine own vices. When thou art in company with another, always
   think about some virtue of his, and of thine own lack thereof, so as to
   humiliate thyself inwardly for those vices of thine which are known to
   God, to the Angels, and to thine own self. Approach thy studies as if
   to take food for thy soul, that she being refreshed by what thou
   readest may learn to be wholly occupied therewith, to forget temporal
   things and to be held back from sin. Also study is of no great profit
   unless thou dost pray and so deal therewith as food is dealt with by
   the teeth--otherwise it is but little good. Therefore deal thus with
   it, and let it pass into thy soul, like food into the belly, to be
   transformed into virtue and good works, that the soul may be sustained
   thereby as by food. For as the body is refreshed by food so is the soul
   by virtue; thou oughtest never to study anything that doth not refresh
   the soul, for the fruit of study is the strength of the soul and the
   gaining of virtue. To study for the sake of teaching others or for any
   other purpose else save as aforesaid doth not nourish the soul, but
   doth make it unwholesome as superfluous humours make the body. Such
   study doth engender vain-glory, a heart puffed up, disorderly manners,
   empty thoughts, unstableness of mind, forgetfulness and light thoughts
   of God, love for the praise of man, a troubled conscience, a darkened
   understanding, and it doth render the soul faint and weak rather than
   refresh it. Wherefore to study in moderation and as it were to chew
   thoroughly what thou readest doth better refresh the soul than to study
   many things thoughtlessly and without so doing. It doth follow that
   that soul is dead, or doth consume herself which doth not so digest the
   word of God as to convert it into virtue and good works; such an one
   doth decay by reason of divers lusts and the desire for honour, and is
   eaten of devils as the body is of worms.

   (41) When the clock doth strike bethink thee that thou art in the midst
   of thine enemies, and art not sufficient of thyself; therefore cry to
   God and pray, saying--"Forsake me not, Lord God, Thou art my God,
   depart not far from me." Sometimes invoke the Blessed Virgin and say
   the Ave Maria. Remember that God seeth thee and that thy works are
   presented before Him by the Angels, whatsoever good thou hast done, the
   progress thou hast made, and the evil thou hast committed. When thou
   hearest the bell, think, "Arise, ye dead and come to judgement."

   Always strive to follow the will of others in those things that are not
   sinful or contrary to the will of God, and always put aside thine own
   desire and thine own counsel.

   Learn to bear those things that are vexatious to all men, and to thee
   are difficult, though it cost thee toil and pain; and never answer any
   other man impatiently. Rather choose to be pitiful and prefer excess in
   this to overhardness.

   When thou dost ask a question of thy Superior or Rector remember that
   it is the Lord Who dwelleth in them that speaketh to thee through their
   mouth and declareth His will; think how perilous it is for thee to
   resist His ordinance that is declared through them.

   Think many times of thy daily sins, from what root they spring.
   Inordinate fear or too great presumption do hinder thee every day.

   To be inclined towards riches, pleasures, high esteem, the praise of
   men, the delights of the world, and thine own will; to be inclined
   towards these, I say, and to do that which is good in thine own eyes,
   and to avoid and think lightly of humility is to go back to sin, and to
   be turned away from Christ, and from the rule of thy spiritual Father;
   for the very road to virtue is this, to resist sin and humbly to obey
   one's Superior.

LIFE OF HENRY BRUNE

   (1)

   I OUGHT not to pass over one who was a man of deep devotion and holy
   simplicity, and a priest of angelic purity; and I think it fitting to
   place his life next in order to that of Lubert, who was his comrade
   from the first and his most beloved fellow-priest, and to set forth
   here somewhat in praise of him. This is that Henry Brune who was the
   companion of Lubert; a man beloved of God and accepted of men; one that
   was kindly to all and burdensome to none. He was born in Holland and
   was a citizen of Leyden, being sprung from honourable parents and
   lineage. He, however, counted the riches and honours of the world as of
   no worth, and withdrawing from the sight of his friends, sought the
   Lord in the days of his youth, and clave to Him with a perfect heart
   even unto his old age. He remained under obedience in the House of
   Florentius, in all humility and meekness, hearing the confessions of
   the Devout and celebrating Mass with great devotion and reverence; for
   he lived in quietness and simplicity of heart without a care for
   temporal things, and dwelt amid the Brethren uncomplainingly, having a
   good reputation throughout all Deventer, and being known amongst the
   Devout in divers places as an Israelite indeed in whom was no guile or
   wickedness; as one without bitterness like a dove and gifted with a
   singular innocency of life. His eyes were ever looking to the Lord, and
   whensoever he could be alone he ceased not from prayer and devout
   meditation.

   (2) Once in winter time he was sitting by the fire, warming his hands,
   but he turned his face to the wall and secretly continued his prayers,
   observing strictly the rule of silence. And I when I saw this, was
   greatly edified, and loved him yet the more, nor did I ever hear a
   complaint concerning him save that he celebrated Mass somewhat more
   slowly than the others; and yet by so doing he drew many laymen to
   devotion when he celebrated, and this tardiness was readily excused to
   him since it sprang from his unwillingness to be separated from his
   beloved Jesus.

   (3) It happened that one of the faithful was tempted in a matter of
   faith by a secret assault of the Devil, for he began to have some doubt
   concerning the Sacrament of the Altar and the Presence therein of the
   Very Body of Christ. And so, as he stood to hear the Mass which this
   devout priest was celebrating, he often sighed, being grieved by the
   wicked suggestions of that malignant spirit, and he prayed to the Lord
   that he would deign to pity him for his wavering mind. And the merciful
   God who doth succour souls to their salvation in many and marvellous
   ways, did teach this man and console him comfortably in the faith by
   showing him a new and strange vision. For he saw not the Species of
   bread between the hands of the priest, but in place thereof there
   appeared before him the form of One more glorious than the sons of men;
   and being greatly bewildered and trembling, he returned thanks and
   blessed God. But the priest knew nothing of this and finished the
   office of the Mass with the Benediction after the usual manner, for
   this vision was not shown for the priest's sake, for he was full of
   faith and grace, but to strengthen one who was weak in the faith.

   (4) Since I am now speaking of the Revered Sacrament I will also
   mention a similar thing concerning a priest in the province of Frisia,
   whose life was less praiseworthy. This story I heard from the mouth of
   our Brother Alardus of pious memory, who told me that there was with
   him a certain priest whose learning was small and his reputation not
   bright: and when this priest entered the Church to celebrate the Divine
   Mysteries, an honourable Matron, knowing his lack of learning, began to
   think scornfully of him and to murmur, saying: "What art thou trying to
   do, ignorant man that thou art? How can one that is so unworthy duly
   celebrate so great a Sacrament?" While she was thinking this the priest
   began to celebrate and to touch the Holy Elements and consecrate Them;
   and when the Sacred Host was elevated after the Consecration according
   to the Ritual of the Church, and all the congregation were adoring in
   faith upon their bended knees, the aforesaid matron opened her eyes,
   and to her amazement and perplexity saw, at the moment of the
   Elevation, the Figure of the Man Christ. After Mass was done she told
   this in private to another priest and humbly confessed the evil
   thoughts which she had formerly had about the Celebrant; and her
   Confessor having diligently inquired how the matter came to pass, and
   concerning the Vision, answered her, saying: "God hath allowed this to
   come to pass for thy Salvation, lest in future thou shouldest think
   evil of priests or doubt that they do truly consecrate even if they are
   of ill -reputation and unworthy life." The woman, hearing this, held
   her faith sure and left it to God to judge His priests.

   (5) Let it not irk thee to hear yet another miracle concerning this
   most Holy Sacrament.

   When I entered the Monastery of Mount St. Agnes to sojourn there, a
   certain Religious Clerk, who abode there for a long time with me, had
   occasion to go to a neighbouring Monastery: and when he was on the way,
   one that was a layman joined himself to him and became his travelling
   companion and talked to him as a friend. So as they were walking
   together and conversing about God, the layman said to the Clerk who
   accompanied him: "My friend, I will tell thee one small matter that
   hath happened in my life. For a longtime I was in such a condition that
   when I entered a Church I could never see the Sacrament of the Altar in
   the Priest's hands, and thinking that I stood too far off, and that
   owing to the dimness of my eyes I could not see well, I approached as
   near as I dared and as was permitted--but this profited me not at all,
   for still I saw nothing between the Priest's hands. This continued to
   me for more than a year, but I did not duly consider what the reason
   might be. At length, coming to myself and being greatly perplexed I
   betook me to a priest and laid bare the whole matter in confession; and
   he heard me kindly, and carefully searching out the secrets of my
   heart, found that I was in a state of enmity towards a neighbour to
   whom I would on no account forgive a trespass that he had committed
   against me. So the good and prudent Confessor, when he knew of this sin
   of malice, instructed me with chiding and admonition, affirming that it
   would be most perilous to continue thus hard of heart, and that I could
   never deserve pardon unless from my heart I forgave all trespasses. And
   this he said had happened to me because I was not worthy to look upon
   the Holy Sacrament since mine eye was evil. Hearing this pious
   admonition of the priest I consented to his counsel, and with hearty
   repentance forgave all injuries, resolving for the future not to avenge
   myself, so that I might be reconciled to God and regain the grace that
   I had lost. Then at length the priest gave me absolution, and having
   imposed penance upon me, let me go. Immediately afterward I went into
   the Church and heard Mass, and having regained the favour of God I saw
   most clearly the Holy Body of Christ in the hands of the priest, and
   returning thanks to God I blessed Him for all His marvellous works.

   (6) But I must return to my task and deal briefly with the happy death
   of Henry Brune, for as his life was adorned with virtue, so the end
   thereof was deservedly a happy passing away from this world. Amongst
   the other virtues of this pious and devout man was this, that he was
   subject in all humility to his superior, giving a good example to
   priests and clerks not to exalt themselves above the younger Brethren
   by reason of their priestly rank. Sometimes on feast days he celebrated
   before the lepers by leave of Florentius, and I served for him on those
   occasions.

   (7) Once he went with the Brothers to obtain indulgences at Arnheim,
   and while they were in the way he was asked for what consideration he
   would give up his indulgences. To this he replied: "I would gladly give
   them all in exchange for this grace, that whensoever I should say
   anything good to anyone, he should straightway be converted and amend
   his life." The Brothers who heard it were marvellously edified by his
   good reply which proceeded from that earnest zeal for souls which dwelt
   within his pious and pure heart.

   (8) So in the year of our Lord 1439 the plague was raging at Zutphen
   where the Brothers of the House of Florentius, and many other
   Religious, then dwelt, having fled from Deventer; and Henry Brune fell
   sick with the disease and lay at the point of death, confidently
   waiting to receive the

   reward of his labours from the Hand of the Lord. He had continued in
   the Community almost from the time of Gerard Groote and had fulfilled
   the Office of the Priesthood for about forty-four years, having far
   outlived all the rest of those who had known their first fervour in the
   Religious Life with him. But throughout his days he laboured at the
   work of writing, and I have often seen him washing vessels in the
   kitchen, and doing other lowly tasks.

   (9) He knew scarcely anything save the things that pertain to God and
   the salvation of souls, nor cared to speak of aught else. And that
   which had been the habit of his life he maintained unto death, for he
   recited all the Hours till the very moment that he gave up his soul,
   nor during his illness did he cease his reading of the Holy Scriptures,
   for he sought comfort rather in the Word of God than in the discourses
   of men. The departure of this most godly priest was in the aforesaid
   year of our Lord, on the day following the Feast of Saint Bartholomew
   the Apostle (being the feast-day of St. Gregory, Bishop of Utrecht), at
   about the eleventh hour of the day, and he was buried in the Cemetery
   of Saint Walburga, the Virgin, which pertains to the College of Canons
   in Zutphen.

THE LIFE OF GERARD OF ZUTPHEN

   (1)

   NOW it is my purpose to trace briefly the virtues of the devout and
   learned Gerard of Zutphen, and to set up his writings and example
   before the coming generation as a pattern to them, and a good memorial
   of his life, for he hath deserved to be named in a foremost place amid
   those brothers who formed the first of our Communities and were zealous
   followers of the Divine Law. Although he lived for but a short time,
   yet he left us Doctrinal Treatises that are most acceptable, for he was
   a very diligent student of the Holy Scriptures, and from the dark
   sayings of the learned he extracted divers aromatic spices having
   virtue against the distempers of vice to heal the languors of the soul,
   as doth appear particularly in two books which he put forth, of which
   one doth begin "A certain Man" and the other is entitled, "Blessed is
   the Man." From his infancy and the days of his youth he was disposed to
   learning, quick of wit, eager to study the liberal arts, and heartily
   averse from worldly business and everything that might hinder the
   pursuit of wisdom.

   (2) When he grew to manhood, being a youth of virtuous disposition, he
   went to foreign schools to be the better instructed, and busied himself
   with all diligence to be regular in attendance, to rise up very early
   in the morning and hasten in due time to hear the lectures. All the
   time given to study seemed short to him, for he was ever desirous of
   gathering from his master's lips some yet more fruitful knowledge which
   he seized and stored up in the inner chambers of his heart. The ardour
   of his mind for progress in learning burned so fiercely that he was
   greatly downcast when the teachers in the Schools did not lecture; and
   for this cause he sometimes wept because there were no lectures on
   holidays, for he was ill-content that any day should go by without
   yielding some fruit of learning. His ingenuous mind was far removed
   from the sloth of dullards and the idle rovings of the wanton who run
   about the streets and take delight in senseless pastimes, but hate the
   School and seldom visit a Church. Gerard, on the other hand, thought
   upon the purpose for which he had come, and the reason for which
   Schools were founded, wherefore he applied himself zealously to study;
   and so wisely did he profit thereby as afterward to deserve to become a
   learner of that Wisdom that is eternal in place of the wisdom of the
   Schools; for by the ordinance of God he came at last to study at
   Deventer, and having found the devout Brothers there he attached
   himself closely to Florentius, and being by this time sufficiently
   instructed, he quitted the unstable worldly life for the sake of the
   love of Christ and his own Salvation.

   (3) Being converted therefore he began to be diligent and instant in
   the amending of his life, to be zealous for spiritual progress, to
   separate his mind from all the entanglements of temporal things, and
   like a good son of the Cloister to love his cell, to give himself up to
   spiritual exercises, and to spend his time in study and writing. For
   this cause many wondered, because he was seldom seen to go forth, and
   sought no solace outside the Monastery. Yet he held the holy writings
   to stand for his greatest solace, and in place of seeking the wide
   expanse of earthly fields, he sought the hallowed mansions of Heaven.
   When he went across the street to the Church he seemed not to notice
   the presence of other men, and when he was asked whether he was not
   hindered by them of the world who passed him, he answered: "It is to me
   as though a herd of swine were passing; what is it to me that they wear
   the form of men?"

   (4) As he sat in his cell he was so occupied with his work, writing,
   reading, and prayer, that often he left his window shut all day and did
   not look out, although the weather might be fair enough. One of the
   Brothers therefore said to him: "Why dost thou not open thy window?
   Thou dost sit here shut up as it were in a cellar, and it would be good
   for thee to breathe the fresh air"; and Gerard, being wholly given up
   to his zeal for discipline, replied: "If I had spare time and could
   take forethought about such matters, perhaps it would be good to do
   so." When he was asked by the same brother what his thoughts were when
   the bell rang for the morning meal, he said: "I go to one duty as to
   another." He scarce cared at all what he ate, nor what the hour for his
   meal might be, and when the necessity for taking food was instant upon
   him, even then he hastened to hear the reading rather than to refresh
   the body, for he took no thought for this latter, but rather was
   careful to restore the powers of his soul, and if Florentius had not
   anxiously provided for his needs he would soon have destroyed himself
   and perished. Thus it came about that for a long time he bore without
   complaint and secretly a disease which physicians call fistula--for he
   was unwilling that any should be troubled with the care of him, or that
   expenses should be incurred on his behalf, and he preferred to suffer
   pain in the flesh as a wholesome medicine for the soul. But when
   Florentius discovered this he called a physician to take charge of him
   until he should be healed.

   (5) He was librarian and keeper of the books, and showed great
   diligence in collecting and copying them. Likewise he lent copies of
   the sacred books to many Clerks outside the monastery that they might
   have readings therefrom in their own houses and in schools, and so
   avoid the telling of idle stories and aimless wanderings on holidays,
   which are seasons during which Clerks are specially admonished to give
   their mind to holy things. He used to say, "These books preach and
   teach better than any words of ours; for holy books are the luminaries
   of our souls and their comfort; they are the true medicine of life,
   which are not less necessary to us during our sojourn here than are the
   Sacraments of the Church." He loved the books of sacred Theology above
   all the riches of the world, and rejoiced more over a fair writ copy
   than over a sumptuous banquet, or wine of most sweet savour; for he
   knew that they shall not be wise who take pleasure in delicate meats
   and drinks; but they who are given up to sacred studies shall be filled
   with wisdom, and access to the hidden treasures of Heaven shall be
   their guerdon. Wherefore he dealt with books in all reverence, reading
   them with the utmost diligence and keeping them in careful ward.

   (6) Many Clerks came to him to resolve divers doubtful matters, and
   heard his discourses gladly, for he was a man that was ready of speech
   and learned, proved by many disputations, and having knowledge how to
   answer every man. Florentius often summoned him to settle the business
   of the Community, and with his assistance was wont to deal with those
   matters in particular which demanded skilled knowledge of law and also
   seemed to require spiritual treatment. In such cases if any grave or
   difficult question arose he reserved it for the examination and
   decision of the wise whenever it was desirable to do so, and he
   listened reverently to learned doctors, followed the authority of the
   Saints without hesitation, and confirmed his own decisions clearly by
   sacred testimony. Wherefore he was highly praised by wise and learned
   men for the abilities that were united in him, but he himself accounted
   the praise of men as nothing, for he did not strive to pursue after
   subtility of speech, but rather to preserve a good conscience. So in
   the understanding of the Holy Scriptures his long application to study
   profited him less than the informing grace of the Holy Spirit Who
   giveth understanding to the little ones and doth reveal His mysteries
   to minds that are pure. Verily Gerard directed all his exercises toward
   the attainment of this purity, impressing the fear of God upon those
   who were newly converted, chiding the slothful, and exhorting those who
   would go forward in virtue to mortify their vices.

   (7) "If," said he, "we neglect to fight against our vices, our passions
   shall prevail, and we shall fall into the snares of the devil who is
   ever lying in wait to hinder our progress. Therefore we must labour
   with all diligence to quit us like men in fighting against them, for a
   crown of Eternal Glory hath been promised to him that overcometh."
   After that he had received the Light this Priest lived humbly and
   devoutly among the Brothers, being filled with grace, and though he had
   read many books, yet before his death he began to read again "The
   Mirror for Monks" and "The Progress of the Religious" as if he were a
   new convert, and from these books he strove to gather afresh the spirit
   of devotion, and to renew himself again to his first fervour. Yet
   burning with such zeal for progress he did not long survive, but
   mindful of Lubert that was dead--a friend whom he had deeply loved and
   for whose departure he had shed many tears--he soon followed after him.
   He was sent with Brother Amilius to the Abbot at Dickeninghe, a man
   learned in Canon law whom he used often to consult in legal questions,
   and as he was returning from his journey he came to Windesheim, and
   while passing the night there fell sick unto death.

   (8) And Amilius said to him, "It seemeth to me that thou art near to
   die," to whom Gerard made answer, "So seemeth it to me also," and so as
   his sickness increased upon him, he breathed forth the breath of his
   life, like one steeped in a gentle sleep, during the night of the Feast
   of St. Barbara the Virgin, in the year of our Lord 1398, and in the
   thirty-first year of his age. His body was buried by the Prior and the
   Brothers, with due honour, in the path before the door of the Church.

   Florentius hearing of the death of the beloved Gerard was very sad, and
   he with all the Brothers wept with great lamentation, for their deep
   love for him constrained them to mourn for the taking away of a brother
   most dear, who was a pillar of their House, and, as it were, another
   hand to Florentius in performing the business thereof.

   But blessed be God Who lent us such a man!
     __________________________________________________________________

LIFE OF AMILIUS OF BUREN.

   (1)

   NOW I must commemorate and set forth in this book the life of the
   beloved Amilius, a priest worthy to serve God. He succeeded Florentius,
   our Reverend Father, and was the second Ruler of the House, being one
   whom Florentius loved as a familiar friend, and a man decked with many
   jewels of virtue.

   He sprang from a family of the Province of Gelders in the territory of
   the Count de Buren; and numbering amongst his forefathers men who had
   been Ministers of State, he was esteemed to hold like rank with them.

   (2) When he came to study at Deventer, where a school for special
   learning was then flourishing, he showed such diligence and progress in
   the Scholastic arts that in a short time he took his place amongst the
   foremost students as one of the more learned, and by reason of the
   subtility of his understanding was held in more than ordinary favour by
   the Master of the School.

   But by the gift of God it came about that a mind so great was not
   wasted away in a worldly life, nor sought to gain earthly honours
   through knowledge, but counted all such things as dross. So, being
   prevented by the Grace of Heaven, and inspired by the Most High,
   Amilius came to the House of Florentius and was drawn to him by the
   holiness of his discourse; he submitted himself to the counsel of the
   Holy Ghost speaking through the mouth of this Reverend Father, who gave
   him the monitions of that Wisdom that is unto salvation.

   Amilius therefore putting aside his studies, and abandoning his carnal
   friends, became an humble Brother and a disciple of Christ; and by his
   example he was profitable to many by leading them to renounce the world
   and to serve Christ. He gave himself up to the fulfilment of the most
   humble duties; for his soul's salvation he spared not his body, nor
   sought he anything for his own advantage in this present life. In the
   virtue of holy obedience he bore heavy labour, such as milling and
   brewing and other tasks entrusted to him, which he performed cheerfully
   and with fidelity.

   (3) Many wondered that, not being large of frame, he could carry out
   such heavy tasks, which assuredly he had not learned during his life in
   the world, nor had been accustomed to aforetime; tasks, moreover, which
   a stronger than he would scarce have undertaken for worldly gain. But
   the love of Christ and the brotherly charity which availeth for all
   things ministered strength to his goodwill, so that his reward might be
   the greater in proportion as he laboured more fervently than all.

   So pleasing was he to God and to the Brothers that, after Lubert and
   Gerard fell on sleep, he was immediately ordained to the priesthood
   whilst Florentius was yet alive, and when the time came that he should
   celebrate his first Mass, Florentius clad in his surplice, attended him
   until he had finished the Office to the honour of God perfectly and
   with devotion. He celebrated at the Altar of St. Paul in the church of
   which Florentius was Vicar, before High Mass and privately, so that
   there was not a large congregation present.

   (4) So at the time of the Plague this man, eminent for piety, truly
   faithful in everything that was entrusted to him, and a comfortable
   friend to all that were in need, took charge of the stricken, being
   ready in the spirit of obedience and fraternal charity either to live
   or die with his Brethren. For he stood fearlessly by John Ketel, the
   Cook of the Community, by Lubert, and many others who were seized with
   the like disease, ministering to them until their death; and having
   rendered such service ofttimes to the Brethren he himself fell sick,
   but amended again, for God had pity upon the Brethren to their comfort
   lest they should have sorrow upon sorrow.

   It was from his mouth that I received many of those good things
   concerning the virtues of the Brothers which I have written in this
   book as occasion demanded, although I have not expressly named him as
   having told me of them.

   (5) Once he came to the Brothers at Mount St. Agnes, and speaking to
   some who were known to him, exhorted them to abide in the holy manner
   of life of the Order so as to go forward in virtue. By his virtuous
   character and gracious words I was greatly edified, for he stood there
   like some gentle lamb serene of countenance and with eyes looking
   steadfastly before him, not regarding the faces of them that stood by.
   After the happy departure of Florentius, who had appointed Amilius to
   be his successor in the governance of the House, he fell asleep in the
   Lord on the Vigil of the Feast of Saint Barnabas the Apostle, in the
   1404th year of our Lord, having ruled the House well for four years and
   three months. He was buried next to Lubert in the Cemetery of St.
   Lebuin, on the south side of the Church not far from the Priest's
   Vestry.

   (6) Amilius's Exhortation to the keeping of Brotherly Love.

   "Hitherto have we continued, my most beloved brothers, ever united and
   in mutual charity, but now as it seemeth I am about to depart from you.
   Wherefore I do heartily entreat you that as ye have been fervent
   hitherto to keep that unity (for which be praise and glory to Christ),
   so ye maintain the same with steadfastness and perseverance; that in
   all things ye lovingly obey him to whom is committed the care of this
   House, even as ye would obey Christ and as hitherto ye have obeyed me,
   not considering his person, but Christ in him; for this cause think not
   the precepts he may give you to be evil, without reason, or contrary to
   your well-being, since it is not he that giveth them, but the Lord
   through him. Obey him therefore for Christ's sake and as if he were
   Christ Himself. Hasten to fulfil his precepts as though they were given
   from Heaven, for the Lord is not always pleased to reveal His will
   directly, or by miracles or by angels, but hath so ordained that we
   should know the same through a human deputy, whom we must obey in all
   his commands and precepts as we should obey the Lord Himself.

   (7) "Therefore whatsoever duties or precepts of charity he layeth upon
   you, these fulfil with willing and cheerful minds, nor think that these
   things shall lack their fruit or hinder your devout exercises or your
   well-being; for a thousand such exercises are nothing compared to
   humility and the subjection that a man doth undergo willingly. So even
   if his commands should seem to be without reason, and like to be a
   great hindrance to you, both at the present and in the time to come,
   nevertheless pass no judgement thereupon, but alway continue humbly in
   subjection, nothing judging. And as I have often said, look to Christ,
   not to the man in his own person; ye are not subject to him because of
   his own proper qualities, but ye submit for the sake of God, for your
   eternal salvation and progress, and for the Kingdom of Heaven. As ye
   have begun so continue to the end, passing no judgement upon your
   Father, but reverencing him deeply, and in all things humbly and
   cheerfully obeying him; think not within yourselves "we are as aged, as
   skilled, as learned, as wise as he," for ye are not put under him for
   his own sake but for Christ's, and for your own humiliation and safety,
   that ye may have recourse to him as to a father for protection and for
   counsel.

   (8) "What is there between you and me, Brethren, save that ye have
   obeyed me for God's sake, and what between me and Florentius (or Gerard
   if I had been here with him) save that I obeyed him for the Kingdom of
   Heaven's sake. Therefore everyone should think how he can humiliate and
   submit himself, and study to be contented whatever office is enjoined
   upon him, whether it be small or whether it be great; nor should any be
   wise in his own conceit, but rather think that whatsoever may have been
   ordained for him, that is the better for him. If any would be excused
   from any office saying that he is willing to give way in all else, but
   that he ought not to be degraded to such or such an office, I had
   rather cast him forth from the House than give him such exemption,
   because at some other time when his own will desired an office other
   than that assigned to him, he would be rebellious in this also. But in
   the matter of willingness to give way, let a man think of naught save
   Christ. Brethren, let us be, as it were, members one of another and
   each sustain the other, which if we do not, our estate shall quickly
   perish. Let us strive each in turn to keep Charity and Unity, and let
   every one seek to be as it were trodden under the foot of another and
   so no adversity shall have power to hurt us.

   (9) "I know of nothing else to say to you save that which the Lord said
   to His disciples just before His Ascension, namely, that ye love one
   another even as Christ loved you, and that ye pray for me; and I, if I
   come to the Lord, will do whatsoever I can for you. In that I have
   often borne myself ill and have been a scandal to you, I pray you to
   forgive me; likewise for my negligence and the other many vices in
   which I have been entangled, all of which I would readily confess
   before you but that I fear lest some of you should be scandalized." So
   saying he put off his hood and besought pardon of the Brethren for his
   faults with compunction and all humility, and began to weep, seeing
   which the Brothers knelt and wept long and bitterly. These were the
   last words of Amilius which he spoke for the building up of mutual love
   and peace.

LIFE OF JAMES OF VIANA

   Concerning James of Viana

   (1)

   IAMES of Viana, a man strong and wise in character, was endowed with
   much grace of humility, repentance and spiritual insight, so that he
   often sighed and wept for his daily failures, strictly examining
   himself thereupon. Likewise he charged against himself actions which
   another would praise in him, for in everything that he did he was
   fearful knowing that it must be weighed in the strict balance of the
   Judge on High, Who shall judge not open negligence only, but also the
   secret stains of the conscience. Far from his heart were proud thoughts
   of himself and the wish to be accounted good, for he desired to be
   lower than all and to give way even to those beneath him as though they
   were his betters. Amongst the writers he was eminent being diligent in
   the copying of books and in his care for them.

   (2) When a young man sought to be instructed by him in spiritual
   exercises, James in his humility immediately confessed that he was
   slothful and a miserable sinner who had not yet really grasped the
   first principles of virtue; and he began to commend certain of the
   younger Brethren, saying that they were men of fervent spirit and
   understanding.

   Upon another time the same youth being very sad told James of the
   distress of his heart, and desired to hear some word of comfort from
   him, and James spake kind and comfortable words to him, exhorting him
   to be patient and to wait humbly for the grace of God, because the good
   Lord is wont to be present with them that are contrite of heart, as
   saith the Psalmist, "According to the multitude of my sorrows in my
   heart Thy comforts have given joy to my soul"; and the young man being
   thus comforted, afterwards often remembered these words that are so
   sweet when any sorrow came upon him, for when the comfort of man
   faileth, one must flee to the Divine, and think how great Saints and
   the Elect also have sometimes suffered heaviness and desolation.

   (3) So because James was a man of laudable life, and coveted to remain
   in the lowest rank and the simple condition of a Clerk, therefore by
   reason of his virtues and this notable gift of humility, he was
   promoted to the Priesthood by the good pleasure of God, and the counsel
   of Florentius and his Brethren. But this promotion was very grievous to
   him so that he wept bitterly when he knew that he must needs be
   ordained, for he confessed that he was too unworthy of such a rank, and
   he deemed that they who had given this counsel had greatly erred in
   that they had determined to promote an unfit person. But the more he
   abased himself the more pleasing was he to God and to the Brethren, and
   the more gladly did Florentius promote him; for at that time the
   Priesthood was a thing rare and precious amongst the Devout, because
   none dared to accept that office save one that was righteous and
   compelled thereto for the Common good, for all avoided higher station
   and chose to abide in a lower room and a lowlier office. Wherefore
   Florentius, himself a gem of the Priesthood, is reported once to have
   said, "If I were not a priest and had not the care of others I might be
   able wholly to amend myself, for higher place doth often cause
   disturbances of mind from which a good man that is under governance and
   liveth without the care of external things is the more free."

   (4) Once when he wished to meditate upon his failures, James secretly
   climbed up to the sollar of the House, and with heavy sighs wrote down
   his faults upon a Tablet so that he might not forget anything that he
   thought he ought to confess.

   When one asked him of the manner of life of the House, he said, "If any
   would live with us it is needful that he abase himself and make himself
   less than all. Such an one hath here a Paradise and is abundantly
   content." Florentius used sometimes to reprove him and recall him from
   the unmeasured heaviness of his compunction, lest by too great severity
   he should exceed the bounds of prudence, and he bore the reproof
   patiently, greatly humbling himself for that he had gone forward
   somewhat imprudently. The fervency of his spirit surpassed the strength
   of his body, but his good intention was his excuse, for the end thereof
   was to seek after God. After this he fell into bodily sickness, and his
   strength failing him by little and little, he died during the lifetime
   of Florentius, that is, on the day following the Feast of St. Gregory
   the Pope, to whom he was specially devoted, and in the year of the Lord
   1400. He was buried with his Brethren in the cemetery of the great
   church that is dedicated to St. Lebuin.
     __________________________________________________________________

LIFE OF JOHN CACABUS

   Concerning John Cacabus, called in the vulgar tongue, Ketel, an humble
   cook

   (1)

   THERE was an humble servant of Christ in the House of Florentius named
   John Ketel, to whom were assigned the duties of the kitchen. This man,
   despising all worldly things, chose the path of holy poverty on earth,
   that in Heaven he might have part in the eternal riches with the
   Saints; and for his works of mercy and charity, his reward was to enter
   into everlasting felicity.

   Long ago he was very well known to me in the days when I resorted oft
   to Deventer, and he showed such humility in his manner of life, and the
   example which he gave, that he preached contempt of the world by his
   deeds more than by his words. Yet his discourse was no vain thing when
   he spake of God, for he persuaded his hearers that all temporal
   greatness is contemptible and that no labour undertaken for the love of
   Christ should be abhorred. But who could tell worthily the virtues of
   this man? and yet charity doth demand that I speak a few words that
   this pearl buried in the Lord's field may not be hidden too long, but
   may be brought forth to the light for the edification of many.

   (2) His native town was Duseborch, which lies in the Countship of
   Marck, not far from Wesel, and near the course of the Rhine. His mother
   Christina, following her son's footsteps, ended her days in the House
   of the Sisters at Deventer. That son had been at first a trader in the
   regions of Flanders and Holland, but his fixed abode was at Dordrecht
   with the merchants that trafficked by sea. He often had the good
   inspiration to serve God, but knew not how to make a beginning, nor by
   what way to travel to the fulfilment of his desire, and when he had
   long continued in the successful conduct of his worldly business, at
   length being inspired by better counsels, he thought to put away the
   deceits of this world, and the heavy yoke of the service thereof, and
   to turn his will to fulfilling the Office of the Priesthood so as to
   serve God in more honourable wise in that state of life. Therefore on
   this account he put aside his worldly traffick, and hearing of the
   repute of the Devout Clerks at Deventer, he came thither to visit the
   School with certain other men of good purpose. He had already gained
   some knowledge of Latin, so as to be able to understand the Scripture,
   and when he saw the holy conversation of Florentius and his brothers,
   he was changed into another man, and together with many others was
   fired with a desire to renounce the world. He left following the rules
   of Alexander and Donatus, and entered into the School where spiritual
   exercises are taught, so as to learn the Will of God in the House of
   Florentius, where many were gathered together and served Christ, being
   founded in humility and made fast in holy Charity.

   (3) He was instant in his request to serve the Brothers in the kitchen
   that so long as he lived he might, in that humble condition, offer a
   service pleasing to God. So after many prayers he was admitted on
   probation, and putting aside his secular garb he was clad in an old
   habit, and a linen apron that was suited to the defilements of cooking;
   but he rejoiced more to be clad in such a garment than he would had he
   been robed in the Priestly stole; and he became a pattern of humility
   and lowliness to all who were in the House, giving himself up wholly to
   mortification for the Love of the Crucified Lord. The fame of his good
   conversation went forth to the ears of men without, and many that had
   high place marvelled that he who had been formerly a wealthy merchant,
   now had become a poor cook and an humble Brother. For though he had
   once designed to climb by the ladder of learning to the dignity of a
   Priest of the Church, he did afterwards put aside all desire for the
   pinnacle of honour and the pride of dignity, and sought the lowest
   room, thus imitating Christ Who humbled Himself and taking upon Him the
   form of a servant, ministered to His disciples.

   (4) While he had continued in the world he had prepared him certain
   priestly vestments adorned in costly wise, and having designs inwoven
   in golden thread. So gorgeous were they that the bishop of a cathedral,
   or a ruling abbot, might have been honoured in the wearing of them. But
   now being informed to his soul's health by the Spirit of God, John put
   aside and rejected all of these, and selling to others his chasuble and
   silken cope, vested himself in vile rags, a dark tunic and a gray
   cloak, being purposed to serve in the kitchen. And for this he returned
   hearty thanks to God that He had called him to this ministry, and had
   not allowed him to perish with the multitude in the world, wherefore he
   sometimes said to the Brothers with great cheerfulness of heart, "Am I
   not become a great Priest and Prelate? for twice every day I administer
   communion to the Brothers"; by which parable he signified that he
   prepared their meal both morning and evening and so renewed Christ in
   the person of each one of the Brothers.

   (5) He was often found praying on bended knee before the kitchen fire,
   and while his hands held the cooking vessels his mouth poured forth
   devout Psalms. He made the kitchen an house of prayer, for he knew that
   God is everywhere, and the material fire was to him a flame whereat to
   kindle the fervour of his spirit. During his labours he would murmur
   melodiously the hymns that he had heard sung in Church, and thus
   bearing God in mind, he was outwardly busied with his cooking, but
   inwardly at leisure to meditate of heavenly things, for he passed no
   time unfruitfully, nor for a moment neglected his spiritual exercises.
   He was diligent to prepare food for the Brothers in due time and
   carefully, for he was the master cook, but yet he provided nothing
   superfluous, and gave to others the better meats, keeping the commoner
   for himself.

   He chose three Saints above others for his own special devotion,
   namely, St. Alexius, who for a long while hid himself in his father's
   house in the garb of a stranger, and patiently bore much contumely from
   his own family; St. Francis, who loved poverty, and would have no
   earthly possessions in this world; and St. Elizabeth the widow, who
   being filled with the bowels of mercy, distributed all her goods .to
   the poor and despised all worldly riches and honours as dross.

   (6) Once he was speaking with his companions concerning holy poverty,
   and so fervent was the sound of his words that by his bearing and the
   transfiguration of his countenance one would have thought that he was
   all on fire within.

   On a holy day when certain Clerks from the School had come to see him,
   he began to speak good words to them, and amongst other things said,
   "Well do we find it written in the Gospel, Blessed are the poor in
   spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,' but nowhere do we find it
   written therein, Blessed are the Masters in Arts.'" And his hearers
   marvelling at the novelty of his words, received them with much
   reverence; likewise he explained his saying to them on the ground that
   knowledge without humility profiteth not, but, that in truth the
   Kingdom of God is attained by poverty of spirit, that is, by humility;
   for this virtue doth gain favour from God now, and Eternal Life in the
   time to come. He was very good and pitiful in feeding the poor,
   particularly such as desired to serve God; and when some said that they
   got but little by begging in the streets, he marvelled that many rich
   men were so churlish and did not give liberally to the poor although
   without much loss to themselves they might practise works of mercy, and
   receive exceeding great rewards from God.

   (7) One day therefore he and another who was chosen to be his companion
   disguised themselves as beggars and went forth, when it was already
   late in the day, to beg bread, wishing to prove the truth of what these
   poor men had said. And John Ketel cried before the doors and said,
   "Give somewhat for God's Sake to a poor stranger who would fain be in
   Jerusalem." By this he meant not that Jerusalem on earth which slew
   Christ and the Prophets, but the Fatherland Above whose inhabitants are
   the Saints and Angels of God; for that country the poor stranger John
   did sigh, being for the time far off in the body from the Heavenly
   Jerusalem, though in his soul he drew nearer to Her every day. Now a
   certain Clerk who was in his house, hearing this cry, arose quickly to
   open the door and know who this stranger might be, and running after
   him he asked, saying, "Who art thou that dost make this petition"? But
   John held his peace for he would not be known, but afterward yielding
   to that other's importunity, he said, "It is I," and the Clerk knowing
   his voice answered "Art thou John Ketel? and now dost thou beg thy
   bread? what is the cause hereof?" John therefore said to him, "Hold thy
   peace and question me no further upon the matter for the cause is pious
   and good." So the Clerk returned to his house and told it to them of
   his household, saying, "Very marvellous is the sight that I have seen.
   John Ketel, the cook of Florentius' house, doth beg bread from door to
   door." And his hearers marvelled, and signed themselves with the sign
   of the Cross, saying, "What doth that good man mean?" and thus
   communing with one another, they were greatly edified by the example of
   John and privately told this which he had done to certain others. But
   John returned to the house, and most joyfully carried into the kitchen
   the broken meats which had been given him as alms, and showed to
   Florentius and the Brothers the blessing he had received, namely, the
   holy bread which he had begged for God's sake. And Florentius rejoiced
   over the devotion of his humble cook and said, "Give us a share of
   thine alms," and John answered: "Gladly will I give you a part hereof
   to eat; but I would in exchange give some of our own bread to the poor,
   for they ought not to lose what is their own but rather to receive an
   increase." Then some of the bread that was begged was put before the
   Brothers for their meal, and John took some whole loaves from the
   buttery to give to the poor for God's sake, as was commanded him, and
   there was great joy in the House over this matter.

   (8) One morning he went forth to a place near the Fishgate to draw
   water from the river, and as he was entering into a boat that belonged
   to one of the fishers so as to reach the clean water, the owner came up
   and said, "What doest thou here, get thee gone quickly from my boat."
   And John bore patiently the words of him that chode him, and gave up
   his design to draw water lest he might offend the man. But then the
   fisher saw that John was an holy Brother and was about to depart
   without a word, so being moved with compassion he said, "Come hither to
   me and give me thy pitcher." Then he drew water and gave John the
   pitcher again saying, "Go in peace," and John returned thanks to his
   benefactor, and carried back the pitcher full of water, praying
   devoutly upon the way, for this was ever his custom when he went forth
   upon any business.

   (9) Florentius knowing that John was a virtuous man and strong in
   spirit to bear adversity often chode him for negligence, and blamed him
   for matters in which he was not really blameworthy. And this Florentius
   did to prove his patience and to set him up as a pattern for others.

   Thus when there were men knocking at the window of the kitchen, and
   others standing at the door John hastened to answer each one severally
   according to his proper need: and as he was running hither and thither
   Florentius knocked upon the table with his hand as if he had need of
   something; but John being fully occupied delayed a little to answer; so
   the good Father said with a serious air to prove him, "How long shall I
   sit here waiting for thee?" to which the good cook replied meekly, "My
   most beloved Master here am I and will bring thee what thou wilt; I
   pray thee pardon my tardiness." Sometimes also Florentius said to him,
   "How is it that this food hath such an ill savour, knowest thou not how
   to cook better? Mayhap the Brothers will murmur because they must eat
   thine ill-dressed food." But John listening patiently to the rebuke,
   and confessing himself negligent replied, "I will gladly amend myself,"
   and Florentius answered, "Thou dost often say so, yet thou dost make
   too small improvement."

   (10) At another time as Florentius was passing through the kitchen John
   came behind him and kneeling down took hold on the hem of his garment,
   asking pardon; and Florentius, looking down upon him said: "What is it
   now?" and John answered, "I have spilled some wine from a cask in the
   cellar"; then said Florentius yet more sternly, "It is thus that thou
   dost waste our substance, now breaking something, now spilling
   something else," and straightway he turned away his face and shut the
   kitchen door, leaving the cook upon his knees; but John bearing all
   humbly arose from the ground making no complaint of this treatment as
   though he had suffered injury, but holding the holy Father who had
   chidden him for his good in the highest esteem. In these and in many
   other ways Florentius often proved John, and yet he loved him with an
   especial love and honoured him with all his heart for his faithfulness
   and love of poverty, a matter whereon the two did oft hold commune in
   the kitchen.

   Though he had no great knowledge of letters, yet had he a good ability
   to understand the Scriptures, knowledge to discern prudently between
   vice and virtue, and to give effectual remedies to the troubled and the
   tempted.

   (11) When he had leisure from his toil he rejoiced to read in some holy
   book, not so as to become more learned in the knowledge that puffeth
   up, but so as to return to his work more fervent in charity. He
   listened with diligence to the reading at table, for he gathered much
   from few words, and his virtue of obedience and frequent meditations
   upon the benefits that God had given him supplied that which the deep
   sayings of a discourse in Latin denied to him: wherefore he studied
   lovingly the life of our Lord Jesus Christ, drawing therefrom a rule
   for every part of his own life; and for His love he embraced the lowest
   calling, coarser food and poorer clothing.

   Sometimes he read the book of John Climacus, "On perfect renunciation
   of the world and mortification of the Will," and expounded therefrom
   sentiments full of spiritual truth, so that wise men marvelled that he
   had so good an understanding of the book.

   (12) A few days before his death he was asked to say whether he knew of
   aught in the house that should be amended, because the Brethren would
   gladly amend themselves, and he made answer as a true lover of poverty,
   saying, "I would desire that we should amend in three things. First,
   that we should eat more sparingly and that more should be given to the
   poor; secondly, that our more precious ornaments should be sold and the
   price thereof be bestowed in like manner; -thirdly, that since we have
   many books some of these should be sold, and only those that are
   necessary retained, and that by this means the poor should be the
   better relieved."

   To these words Florentius, rejoicing over his devotion and his
   compassionate spirit, replied, "John, that which thou sayest is very
   good."

   While he was sick certain poor clerks came to visit him, and looking
   upon them with eyes full of pity, he said, "Oh! my beloved poor,
   henceforward I shall not be able to give you anything, but I commend
   you to God that He may provide for you in every good thing." Amongst
   his other exercises in humility he had the following custom: on every
   Sabbath he would clothe him in a long linen robe or shroud to remind
   him of death and in this garment he would cook on that day. Moreover,
   he earnestly entreated that he might be buried therein after his death,
   and this was done, for Matthias of Mecklin who was his comrade, let
   wash this robe that John might be buried in it even as he had desired.
   So when the time drew near that this John, our cook and God's servant,
   who was filled with many a fruit of virtue, should depart from this
   life, he fell sick just before the octave of the Feast of Pentecost,
   being smitten with an imposthume, and began to set himself in order for
   his approaching departure.

   (13) But before his weakness grew upon him, he of his obedience and
   charity, began once more to take charge of poor clerks and the sick,
   being desirous to visit them and to provide carefully for their
   necessities, which thing did yet further increase his desert. But
   herein he was prevented by his weakness, and he was wondrously consoled
   by the sweetness of the Presence of Christ Who visited him. For one day
   Amilius, who faithfully attended him in his sickness and ministered
   continually to him, came very early in the morning to visit him, asking
   whether he wished for aught; and then John assenting thereto he went
   into the church to hear Mass. But when the service was ended he
   returned to the sick man who asked him, "Wilt thou of thy charity share
   with me the benefits of the Mass which thou hast heard"; and Amilius
   answered, "Gladly do I give and assign all to thee in charity, dear
   Brother," to which John replied, "My Brother, whilst thou wert gone our
   Lord Jesus Christ hath deigned to visit me," and Amilius hearing this
   said, "Tell me, I pray, when did He depart?" and John answered, "The
   moment thou didst open the door He vanished." So Amilius rejoiced and
   blessed God, giving Him thanks, and afterward he told me fully all that
   was done.

   (14) Satan also strove to deceive and affright the servant of God,
   saying thus to him, "Take thy purse again, foul merchant! Thinkest thou
   that thou canst buy the Kingdom of Heaven with thy money? "But the
   humble John, understanding the malice of the enemy, said secretly in
   his heart, "I presume not to rely upon mine own merits, but upon the
   mercy of God and the merits of the saints." And so the enemy was put
   utterly to confusion and departed from him, and John did commit himself
   in faith to the Divine mercy; and being a faithful servant of Christ
   turned himself yet more closely to prayer, and ruminated upon these
   words amongst other songs of psalmody, "The Lord looseth them that are
   fettered, the Lord enlighteneth the blind." Amilius, who sat by his
   pallet, bowed down his ear to hear something more from the lips of one
   that was in the very agony of death, that he might record the same as a
   good memorial of him; but he could understand nothing because of the
   hoarseness of the weak voice.

   (15) At length after along death agony wherein he strove laboriously
   against the might of death, he breathed forth the breath of his life
   amid the devout prayers of the Brothers who had come together, and so
   made a blessed end of a life completed in the service of Christ. He
   died in the year of the Lord 1398, on the fourth Sunday after
   Pentecost, which day was the Feast of St. Petronilla the Virgin. His
   poor body was buried in the cemetery pertaining to St. Lebuin's Church,
   where also divers Brethren who died after him rest in peace, to be
   raised again through Christ upon the Last Day, together with all the
   faithful. Praise and glory be to Christ for a man so devout as was this
   humble cook, who, after a short course of years and but little toil,
   had allotted to him in heaven, as we piously believe, the greatest of
   rewards. Concerning him the venerable Father John Huesden, Prior at
   Windesheim, has borne worthy testimony, saying, "Would that it might be
   my lot to live with such a man and to die in like state even as he
   died!"

   Here beginneth the Book of the devout exercises of this same Brother
   John

   (16) What can I render to Thee, God Eternal, for all the benefits that
   thou hast rendered unto me?

   O! my beloved John, have pity upon thyself, and with much diligence and
   all thy strength ponder over thy past life; think what thou wert in thy
   worldly days, nay, what thou art even yet and what are thy deserts.
   Think upon the inestimable goodness of our Beloved Lord Jesus Christ
   which He hath shown in fuller measure to thee than to so many;
   remember, therefore, that His judgement shall be more heavy upon thee
   than upon those others, except thou amend thyself. Stand in awe and
   think that though in His so great kindness He hath spared thee, yet
   perhaps He may not will to spare thee any longer. Keep in thine heart
   this thought that to-day--or at furthest to-morrow--thou must die, and
   then whither shalt thou go?

   (17) Woe is me, oh God Eternal! whither shall I flee from the face of
   Thy wrath, for my sins are more in number than the sands of the sea;
   yet know I in very truth that nought is so displeasing to Thee as
   despair, and that Thou desirest not the death of a sinner but his
   repentance.

   For this cause, say unto God with groaning of heart: "Oh! immeasurable
   goodness of God, look upon me a miserable sinner; oh! mercy all
   embracing turn Thee unto me that am a man full of iniquity. Behold! I
   that am desolate, come to the Almighty; wounded I haste to the
   Physician.

   "O Thou Who hast stayed so long the sword of vengeance, continue Thine
   accustomed goodness, and according to the multitude of Thy mercies blot
   out the count of mine offences."

   There are also many other thoughts upon which thou mayest ponder
   concerning the mercy of God, as His mercy to David, St. Peter, St.
   Paul, Mary Magdalene, the Publicans, and many other sinners. For it is
   clearly manifest throughout the whole life of Christ, how pitiful He
   was to penitents who came to Him; and in regard to them He weighed not
   the multitude of their sins but the greatness of their love, (18)
   Wherefore, if I would reach that love, then it is above all things
   necessary for me to consider mine own frailty, and truly to feel that I
   can do no good thing of myself. Likewise I must keep the greatness of
   God and His faithfulness continually before mine eyes, together with
   mine own littleness and unfaithfulness towards Him. In this there are
   many things to be considered, and if I give right heed to them the
   consideration thereof shall lead me to make myself subject to all men,
   to despise myself even as also I should desire to be despised. But
   these exercises must be conducted truly and with careful thought, and
   one must constantly invoke the help of the Lord from Whom must come the
   power to perform such exercises.

   If therefore I would reach that state of humility and that love, it is
   needful for me to have a daily exercise and rule to lead me to these
   things. And so, according as Saints have said, I must look to my past
   sins, keep them ever before mine eyes and make all endeavour to weigh
   them. To do this will keep me in subjection and humility, and I shall
   not think the defects of the Brothers and other men to be heavy, nor
   shall I judge them lightly, but have compassion upon them, and lead
   them to better things.

   Wherefore it is expedient for me to strive to this end, and to beware
   of searching curiously into the deeds or words of others; to avoid
   detraction, and if I hear any such thing to strive to find excuses,
   putting the matter aside and casting it away.

   This also will help me greatly, namely, to consider the virtues of my
   Brethren, of whom I believe that the greater number have never
   committed mortal sin, On the other hand, I must think upon the
   greatness of mine own sins, so shall I find that I am not worthy to
   live amongst the Brethren nor to serve them, and I must hold them in
   reverence and hope that through their good works and prayers I may
   reach Life Eternal.

   Likewise it is needful for me to have the Presence of God before mine
   eyes at all times, and daily to strive inwardly to have good thoughts
   during my work, and in everything to imitate with a single heart that
   most worthy Pattern, namely, the Life of our Lord Jesus Christ, His
   humility, His patience, His contempt of the world and poverty, but,
   above all, His charity.

   Also, I must strive greatly to look upon every man as the image of God
   and so to deal with all my work as if I were doing it unto Christ; this
   will greatly lighten my toil and make me benevolent to everyone.

   I will strive also to recite my prayers attentively without haste,
   often in my work and labour to bow my knee, and pray awhile briefly but
   with attention.

   Every morning at the third hour when thou hearest the bell, thou
   oughtest to rise without delay and straightway begin to meditate upon
   some holy subject, giving thanks for the mercy of God; remember thine
   own misery, and that God, the Angels, and the Saints are there with
   thee.

   Be careful what thou readest and with whom thou dost converse.

   Kneel down or sit decorously without accidie or leaning to one side or
   the other, and always bear thyself thus when thou dost pray.

   When Mattins or Prime are over, read the Holy Scripture, and if thou
   art heavy with sleep write down something from the subject of thy
   study. When the fifth hour doth sound do whatsoever thou hast to do in
   the kitchen, and if there is nothing there, shut up the kitchen and
   bind some books, or if anything hath been committed to thee, do it
   until it is time to go into the kitchen.

   When the bell doth ring for Mass, read the first part of Tierce as far
   as the Psalms while thou art still in the House, and continue to read
   the remainder on thy way as thou goest to Church. Kneel upright upon
   thy knees in Church in some corner during the whole of Mass; and after
   thy usual custom meditate upon the Life and Passion of our Beloved Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   When Mass is done begin whilst thou art still in Church to read Sext as
   far as the Psalms, and read the rest upon thy homeward way. When thou
   hast returned to the kitchen from Church pray awhile, determine in
   thine heart how thou wouldest order thyself during the day, and what
   are the points in which thou oughtest to amend thyself; then strive
   steadfastly to this end, keeping before thine eyes (as was said before)
   that Divine Mirror of the Life and Character of our beloved Lord, and
   remembering that it is to Him and not to men that thou art ministering.

   In the midst of thy work and labour thou oughtest to say often and
   attentively some brief prayer upon thy bended knees, especially at the
   ringing of the Bell, and when the signal soundeth in the Church to
   announce the Elevation of the Holy Body of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Constantly constrain thyself in the midst of thy work to have some good
   thought, as, for example, the benefits of God, the Kingdom of Heaven,
   the Judgement, or Death: and when anyone doth knock at the kitchen door
   look to it that thou give a good answer.

   If thou hast time study awhile in the book of extracts which thou hast
   copied.

   Whomsoever of the Brothers thou seest either within or outside the
   House, look upon him as upon Christ, having special regard for those
   who have the care of the House, and if they require aught of thee do it
   quickly and with a cheerful countenance.

   Before beginning a meal read the Benedicite, and during thy meal be
   instant to read or to meditate upon something that is good.

   Take heed lest thou eat too hastily, or partake of delicate meats or
   drinks; be not longer at the table than are the Brethren, and during
   the meal, if any one of those who serve the table doth knock at the
   door, arise quickly. After the meal thou must provide for the Reader
   the hot victual like that which the Brothers have had. Meanwhile, read
   the Grace and put away the remnants of the food, and the cooking
   vessels each in his own place, as quickly as thou canst. When thou
   comest to thy cell after dinner, immediately read Nones and then do thy
   work and labour with the lay Brothers until the second bell for
   Vespers, unless thou hast some other duty in the House or abroad. After
   this read thy Vespers. If thou hast further time to spend meditate upon
   or study some holy subject until the fourth hour, and then go to the
   kitchen to prepare supper for the Brothers; after this meal prepare for
   the following day such food as the sick or the Brethren may require.
   When thy business in the kitchen is done go to thy cell and read
   Compline, after which thou mayest study or do any good thing until the
   eighth hour, at which time thou oughtest to write down thy failures and
   to meditate piously upon some holy matter, to say some prayer with
   invocation of the Saints, and having such thoughts in mind to go to bed
   about the ninth hour endeavouring to fall asleep while yet meditating
   upon holy things.

   When thou dost awake let thy thoughts dwell straightway upon some holy
   matter, that thou mayst be able to sleep again with such things still
   in mind.

   Before all these things I ought to prefer obedience; and it is my
   desire, whatsoever the rulers of the House may order (though their
   decision agree not with mine own ideas) to abandon mine own will
   without hesitation in these matters, to do at once whatsoever they
   desire, and not to hold to anything or to any task with inordinate
   affection; for if I abstain from so doing I shall the more easily
   abandon mine own will.

   Furthermore I ought to strive to hold in reverence and honour those who
   are the Guardians and Procurators of the House: to take all heed not to
   harbour harsh thoughts and suspicions of them, to perform dutifully and
   without reserve all that they desire, not judging or seeking to inquire
   the reasons for which they order this or that; to keep mine own
   foolishness clearly before mine eyes, remembering that I am not wise,
   and to think their wisdom great.

   Of a surety also I must keep before mine eyes the fact that I have
   resigned myself to these Superiors as being in the place of God, and so
   am not mine own, although I have bound myself to this obedience not by
   vow but of my own free and untrammelled will and purpose, and this have
   I done in the hope that it is wholesome for me so to stand rather than
   to act according to mine own judgement and pleasure; therefore I desire
   to think upon this purpose of mine, and earnestly to entreat my
   Superiors to keep me in subjection.

   Moreover I must strive in all my works, words, and thoughts to fear God
   rather than man, that whatsoever I do it may be solely to the honour of
   God and to please Him only; in like manner whatever trespass I commit I
   must fear therein the offence I give to God more than that I give to
   men. In very truth I must keep myself from boasting, from the desire of
   outward show and from the love of praise from men.

   (19) Also I must strive mightily to keep silence, for this shall be a
   notable aid to many virtues. I will strive when I speak to do so
   prudently; to say one "Ave Maria" in the interval before I speak, or
   reply; not to exaggerate: to avoid loose talk and the use of many or
   high-sounding words, especially in the kitchen; and to be careful to
   admonish others in this regard.

   I must earnestly endeavour to be alone whenever I can, to put on my
   spiritual armour, never to be idle on any account, and to avoid
   speaking or listening to defamatory talk. In the office assigned to
   thee be diligent to preserve the outward appearance of order; be
   obedient in the performance of thy duties and show thyself to be kindly
   to every man, especially by providing food for the sick, particularly
   for our Father Florentius, who is almost always weak and sickly. I
   resolve to be benevolent to all strangers, receiving them as I would
   Christ, but not talking much with them; to look well to the care of the
   poor, and to do all that is entrusted to me so far as in me lies,
   namely, to hold them in reverence, to show them kindness, and to keep
   ward faithfully over the goods entrusted to me.

   (20) When I go abroad on business I will strive to keep watch over mine
   eyes, to read some good book or to meditate while in the streets, and
   to return homeward as quickly as nay be. Also I will endeavour to make
   known my temptations; and at least once in the week to lament over my
   sins to some one person, to accept the remedies that he proposeth,
   rejecting none, and to endeavour always to admit my guilt; and if I
   break anything, or neglect any duty, I desire to ask pardon therefore
   freely.

   Also I would abstain from too often tasting the food before it is sent
   up, save in case of need; from drinking (save at meal times) without
   leave from my Superiors; and from doing anything behind their backs
   that I would not dare to do before their faces.

   I ought to strive earnestly to perform all despised and humble tasks
   and to relieve our Brothers Matthew and John thereof whenever I can do
   so, to hold them in reverence, to show myself kindly to them and prompt
   to aid in every humble task.

   (21) I will beware that no complaint be heard from me of my clothing,
   my food, and the like; but I will strive rather to feel that I am
   unworthy of those things which I lack; it is my duty also to read
   diligently such books as may help me to this end, to give my whole
   attention to the attainment thereof, to strive to order myself
   modestly, whether I am walking, standing, sitting, or the like.

   It is also profitable to me to esteem the spiritual exercises of this
   House more highly than those of other Houses, to have a great love for
   my work in the kitchen, a full resolve to die in this condition, and
   not to depart from it by reason of anything that may come to me save
   only in virtue of the rule of obedience.

   In this I must have all confidence towards our most loving Lord, namely
   that He is ready to forgive all my sins, and to give me freely mine own
   proper reward for everything I do, however small it be.

   And though there are many other tasks greater and holier, yet I must
   not leave mine own work, but remain constant thereunto, being assured
   that for me no task is more wholesome or more profitable than that to
   which the Lord hath called me.

   Besides these things it is my desire to examine myself daily after the
   eighth hour in all matters of this kind, to ascertain that in which I
   have trespassed, and (as I hope), to resolve firmly to amend myself
   surely therein for the time to come.

LIFE OF ARNOLD OF SCHOONHOVEN

   Concerning Arnold of "Schoonhoven" (that is, "Bellae Curiae"), a devout
   Clerk

   (1)

   IN the days when the Church at Deventer flourished through the presence
   there of that Reverend Father Florentius, and many scholars came to
   that city from divers regions desiring to be taught, there came also
   from the country of Holland a youth whose natural disposition was good,
   and in whom was no worldly malice. His name was Arnold, and he was the
   son of one Wyrone, a faithful man and an honourable citizen of
   Schoonhoven. While Arnold was still in his parent's house, and attended
   the School with the boys that were his comrades, he followed not the
   ways of those that sported in the streets, but it was his custom to
   enter the Church in the morning and there to offer his prayers and vows
   to God before the several Altars, giving up his heart betimes in the
   day to the Lord Who made him. The first beginnings of a boyhood so
   devout contained the promise of that fuller grace which he should earn
   when he came to man's estate; for God shielded him that he continued
   untouched by the contagion of the flesh. As I have said, he came to
   Deventer, where at that time Master John Boheme was in authority, and
   he presented himself before the face of Florentius, hoping to obtain a
   lodging in one of the Houses of the Devout Clerks. At that time there
   was no small number of these Clerks living in the several Houses under
   the rule and discipline of that most devout Father, and following the
   holy commandments of their Lord, His counsels and precepts, and also at
   set times toiling at the work of copying books for the Schools.

   (2) So Florentius, perceiving that Arnold was earnestly disposed to the
   service of God and wholly turned away from the world, gave him leave to
   abide in his own ancient House wherein dwelt divers Clerks, about
   twenty in all, living at the common charge, having a common table and
   expenditure, and serving God with great devotion. Amongst their number
   were three lay Brothers, of whom one was the Procurator, who bought all
   things necessary for the Community, the second was over the kitchen,
   and the third mended the clothes. In after days some of the Brethren
   from this House passed into the order of Canons Regular; others
   attained the Priestly rank, and by reason of the good examples which
   they had seen and learned at Deventer, bore fruit in other places.

   (3) At this same time, by the aid and counsel of Florentius, I also
   took up my abode in this house, and continued in the Community for
   about a year, having Arnold as my companion, for we were content to
   share one little cell and bed. Here indeed I learned to write, to read
   the Holy Scripture and books on moral subjects, and to hear devout
   discourses; but it was chiefly through the sweet conversation of the
   Brethren that I was inspired yet more strongly to despise the world;
   and by the pious admonitions of Arnold I was holpen and instructed
   every day. All that I was then able to earn by writing I gave for the
   expenses of the Community, and what I lacked, the generous piety of my
   beloved Father Florentius defrayed for me, for he succoured me in every
   way like a father.

   (4) Thus I noted in Arnold many signs of devotion, for he was
   altogether exemplary and devout both in the House and the School, not
   hurtful or harsh to any, but acceptable and kindly unto all. Every
   morning at the fourth hour when the Bell gave warning, he awoke
   instantly and arose with alacrity, and then, before the bed on bended
   knees, he said a short prayer, fervently pouring forth the first fruits
   of his mouth to the Lord. After dressing himself quickly, he went in
   due time to the Oratory to recite the morning Office of the Blessed
   Virgin Mary and of the Holy Cross, and he did not keep the others
   waiting but was instant to arrive before them all.

   When it was time to go to Mass he hastened to be amongst the first in
   Church and humbly bowed the knee before the Altars, hearing the Office
   of the Mass with the reverence of a suppliant, and ceasing not from
   prayer and holy meditation until the solemn rites were finished in due
   order. He loved to choose a private place far from the crowd so that he
   might not be hindered in his prayers, and the more private his place
   the more fervent were his supplications. He avoided to be seen of men
   lest in any way he might become conspicuous by his devotion, and
   likewise he took care that his voice might not be heard abroad, for his
   desire was to open his heart in private prayer to God only; but yet his
   burning light could not always be thus hidden nor hindered from shining
   abroad though he were fain to hide it.

   (5) Thus it sometimes happened that though he wist not of it, I stood
   by and noted secretly what he did, and was set on fire by his fervour
   in prayer, for I desired that I too might sometimes feel a devotion
   like to that which he seemed to feel every day. Nor was it wonderful
   that one who kept careful ward over his heart and lips wherever he
   went, should be devout in prayer, for the sound of joy was heard from
   his mouth by reason of the most sweet savour of his devotion, as if he
   were partaking of delectable food, according to that saying of the
   Psalmist: "The high praises of God shall be in their lips." As he sat
   with the boys in School he noted not their childish clamour, but as the
   Master delivered his lecture he wrote the same on paper and afterward
   read it over to himself or with a comrade, thereby avoiding vain talk;
   for he did not betake himself to worldly employments, but when the
   lectures were done he read awhile in the Holy Page, and often prayed
   silently or sighed inwardly; for in his studies he sought God above all
   else. When he found aught that was especially noteworthy, he of his
   charity showed it to the comrade who was with him or gave him the
   passage to read, and thus by the Sacred word and by his holy discourse
   he turned many away from scurrilous talk and laughter. On Feast Days
   when many persons came to the town, he brought not a few to the House
   of Florentius to hear his discourse, not regarding their age or
   condition, but rejoicing over them and hoping for the conversion of
   some; and through the inspiration of God he was not disappointed of his
   desire, for he saw the fruit of his labours in the amending of the
   lives of these worldlings, both young and old. His discourse and
   exhortation dealt not with lofty matters nor with things foreign to the
   purpose in hand, but with true conversion to God and the amendment of
   life in the world; and the holy simplicity of his devout words was more
   profitable than the subtility of a Latin discourse.

   (6) When he seemed to be sufficiently advanced in learning he occupied
   himself wholly with spiritual studies, deserting those of the Schools;
   he forgat his parents, his home, and his country for the sake of Life
   Eternal, and submitted himself most readily to the yoke of obedience
   and to the discipline of the Clerks, as was the laudable custom first
   instituted by our Father Florentius in that ancient House. He toiled
   not greatly to attain much learning, but rather to preserve a good
   conscience and purity of heart, for he knew that the pure in heart are
   blessed and most pleasing to God. He began to be instant and earnest in
   his prayers to be allowed to abide all the days of his life in the
   House of Florentius, for there was no other state of life in the whole
   world that he would choose save that in which he could pass his days
   with the Brothers who were so devout and worthy to be accepted of God,
   beneath a strict rule and in obedience to the most reverend Father of
   the House. At this time those disciples and most devout pupils of our
   beloved Father Florentius, whose lives I have written above, were still
   in the flesh, namely, Lubert, Henry, Gerard, Amilius, James and John
   Ketel, and there were with them some others who had been amongst the
   first members of that Community. These were fervent in the love of
   Christ, and let their light shine as an ensample to their neighbours,
   and the beloved Brother Arnold desired to be knit to them in humble
   fellowship and sincerity of life, for he knew that his should be a
   happy fortune if he should be thought worthy to spend the whole space
   of his mortal life with these Florentian Brothers that lived the life
   of Chastity on earth. But though he was importunate in his prayers
   Florentius delayed to grant his petition so that he might have a better
   probation, and he spake to him in this wise: "Learn to write well and
   then there may be hope for thee."

   (7) Hearing this he expended all diligence in learning the art of
   writing, and often went to some skilful writer, asking to be more fully
   instructed by him; and he said to me: "Would that I could write well
   that I might the sooner dwell with our Father Florentius! I believe
   that through God's grace I should have a good will to overcome my
   passions if only I knew how to write," When I heard this I marvelled at
   his righteousness and fervour, in that he endeavoured with all his
   might to do what Florentius had bidden him, and I transposed his saying
   and thought in my heart: "I should have a good will to learn writing if
   only I could amend my life."

   But Arnold had a special grace from God which instructed him in every
   good work so that no matter of obedience seemed hard to him, and this
   grace he strove to nurture with holy exercises and to preserve with
   anxious prayer lest it might be imputed to him that he had received
   God's grace in vain. Therefore, before he read or began to write, he
   said a short prayer making his work an offering to God, and at the end
   thereof he did the same, returning thanks to Him. When he went forth
   from the House or returned to his cell, he bowed the knee before the
   Image of Christ, and so with prayer and obeisance he went about his
   business.

   (8) Every hour when the Bell rang he said an Ave Maria or some similar
   invocation, and while he was still attending School, if he saw the door
   of the Church open before or after school-time, he gladly entered and
   remained there so long as time allowed, or at least made a reverence
   toward the Church. The pious customs that were enjoined by his Elders
   he carefully observed and did not knowingly omit even the least of
   them. He accepted the admonitions given him with gratitude, be the
   matter never so slight, and earnestly strove to amend. He received
   every word spoken by the Superior or his vicar as humbly as if he had
   heard the same from the mouth of God, or of some Saint, but he ventured
   not to discriminate or judge by interpreting the order otherwise than
   as it was given. For these things' sake he had great peace of heart and
   was dear alike to God and man, being willing and ready to do all that
   was commanded him as one that rejoiceth ever in the Lord.

   (9) Before the Festivals of Christ and the Saints he was instant and
   zealous to prepare himself for the Holy Communion, and he used to say:
   "A great Feast is at hand, therefore let us prepare ourselves devoutly
   to receive the Lord"; or, again: "To-day is the Feast of such a Saint,
   let us earnestly implore his suffrages."

   (10) When a certain youth was speaking with Florentius of the vice of
   vainglory and asking for a remedy therefor, Arnold, who was passing by,
   came upon them, and Florentius seeing him said to the youth: "What
   sayest thou of that Brother yonder? Is he also vainglorious?" To which
   the youth answered: "I trow not"; and Florentius said: "I wit well that
   it is as thou sayest."

   So when the fulfilment of his desire had been delayed for about a year,
   and having been proved sufficiently, he had still continued constant,
   longing with all his heart to be allowed to join the Brotherhood,
   Florentius yielded to his petition and accepted him, giving him a place
   amid the Brethren; this was a thing most joyful to him, and he returned
   hearty thanks to God therefor. Then as though he were converted anew
   and called to a more perfect state, he strove so zealously after an
   earnest and humble conversation, as to become to all a pattern of
   virtue and utter subjection; he let slip no whit of that primitive
   devotion and those good customs which were handed down to him by the
   former Brethren of the House; he apprehended the discipline with all
   his heart, exercising himself in virtue and daily renewing himself
   therein according to the saying of the Apostle: "Be renewed in the
   spirit of your mind." He shook off all sluggishness from him, being
   ever ready to watch and pray, diligent in his writing and in
   admonishing the negligent piously and with charity, being led thereto
   by godly zeal.

   (11) There seemed to dwell in him no will other than that of his
   Superior whose deeds and words he magnified, and embraced humbly, as if
   they proceeded from heaven, and thus he continued like an innocent
   child in obedience and subjection, not in his youth only but unto his
   life's end. He shewed his lowliness and modesty in his outward apparel
   as well as in his speech and conduct, and if he perceived that anyone
   went beyond the established usage or fell short thereof, he always
   strove to persuade him to choose the better part.

   For himself he chose the lowest place unfeignedly and of set purpose,
   and just as the bearing of humiliation is a burden to some, so his
   burden was the finding of humiliations to inflict upon himself.

   Amid the Brothers he was cheerful but not frivolous, nor was he given
   to much talking but put a guard over his mouth and uttered only words
   tending to edification, for he was more ready to hear than to teach.

   In his labour he was faithful and earnest, and was grieved if he could
   not always rise up in the night and help the Brothers in their brewing.
   Before the hour for writing he would prepare his pens so that he might
   be the less hindered from his work and the more promote the common
   good.

   (12) He strove so to order his doings that the Brethren might not be
   burdened by him, but that he might rather bring in something to their
   profit; and therefore in his anxiety to avoid so far as possible
   consuming the fruit of their labours he gladly performed his share of
   the common labour, and also tasks beyond these. Moreover he rejoiced
   that if aught was lacking in the gains that he earned by writing this
   was supplied by his father after the flesh who used to send year by
   year a certain sum of money to the Brethren. After the death of his
   parents he would have given gladly all the inheritance which fell to
   him for the use of the Community, but in this purpose he was hindered
   by death, which was beforehand with him. For when he was purposed to go
   to Holland to settle the affairs of his inheritance, he came to
   Zutphen, to the Brethren who were then sojourning there, and after a
   few days he fell sick just after the Feast of St. Philip and St. James,
   wherefore his journey to his native land was deferred lest haply his
   end might come when he was far from the fellowship of the Brethren.

   (13) Though he felt that his weakness was growing more and more upon
   him yet he lay not long upon his bed, for upon the Day of St. Wyrone
   the Bishop--which was the last save one of his life--he himself made
   his own bed, and on the following day, that is on the Feast of St.
   Gengulphus the Martyr, about the hour of Vespers, having settled his
   affairs, he received the Communion of the Holy Body of Christ and the
   Unction. But late in the evening, feeling himself very weak, he desired
   that the Brethren should come together to him, and to them he devoutly
   commended himself, begging them to pray faithfully for him and to
   report his death to a certain devout Virgin at Schiedam, named. Lydewy,
   who had promised to pray for him, for he had once visited her in
   Holland, and many wondrous things are told of her by reason of her long
   suffering patience.

   Having made these requests he lay until the tenth hour when the day was
   closing, continuing sound in mind, and he showed no sadness when he
   came to the last hour but said he was ready. Then, his Brethren being
   present and praying round him, he rendered up his soul without much
   pain, as it would seem. He had lived amongst the Devout Brothers from
   his youth up, in a good conscience, being a true worshipper of God and
   a devout lover of Christ, and had persevered for thirty-one years in
   the Community in the humble condition of a Clerk.

   This sweet and amiable brother died in the year of the Lord 1430, on
   the ninth day of May, in the City of Zutphen in Gelders, and was buried
   in the Cemetery of the Blessed Virgin Mary toward the South side of the
   Church.

   Novice

   (14) Hearing the lives of these men I am constrained to despise mine
   own, for thereby I see how far I am from the true virtue.

   But yet I hope that it is profitable to me to have learned this from
   thy narration, for I purpose from my heart to amend myself.

   The Elder Brother

   For this purpose I have told these things to thee, though briefly, that
   thou mayest make it thy study to give thyself to fervency of spirit,
   nor ever aspire to any dignity or honourable office, but mayest rather
   labour to be altogether in subjection and to root out thy vices.

   So shalt thou be able the more fully to please God Who doth ever grant
   a special grace of devotion to the humble, and after the toil of this
   present life glory for ever and ever to them that have fought a good
   fight.

    AMEN.
