THE KERR LECTURESHIP.

   The "Kerr Lectureship" was founded by the Trustees of the late Miss
   Joan Kerr, of Sanquhar, under her Deed of Settlement, and formally
   adopted by the United Presbyterian Synod in May 1886. In the following
   year, May 1887, the provisions and conditions of the Lectureship, as
   finally adjusted, were adopted by the Synod, and embodied in a
   Memorandum, printed in the Appendix to the Synod Minutes, p. 489. From
   these the following excerpts are here given:-- II. The amount to be
   invested shall be Â£3000. III. The object of the Lectureship is the
   promotion of the study of Scientific Theology in the United
   Presbyterian Church. The Lectures shall be upon some such subjects as
   the following, vis.:--A. Historic Theology--(1) Biblical Theology, (2)
   History of Doctrine, (3) Patristics, with special reference to the
   significance and authority of the first three centuries. B. Systematic
   Theology--(1) Christian Doctrine--(a) Philosophy of Religion (b)
   Comparative Theology, (c) Anthropology, (d) Christology, (e)
   Soteriology, (f) Eschatology; (2) Christian Ethics--(a) Doctrine of
   Sin, (b) Individual and Social Ethics, (c) The Sacraments, (d) The
   Place of Art in Religions Life and Worship. Farther, the Committee of
   Selection shall from time to time, as they think fit appoint as the
   subject of the Lectures any important Phases of Modern Religious
   Thought, or Scientific Theories in their bearing upon Evangelical
   Theology. The Committee may also appoint a subject connected with the
   practical work of the Ministry as subject of Lecture, but in no case
   shall this be admissible more than once in every five appointments. IV.
   The appointments to this Lectureship shall be made in the first
   instance from among the Licentiates or Ministers of the United
   Presbyterian Church of Scotland, of whom no one shall be eligible who,
   when the appointment falls to be made, shall have been licensed for
   more than twenty-five years, and who is not a graduate of a British
   University, preferential regard being had to those who have for some
   time been connected with a Continental University. V. Appointments not
   subject to the conditions in Section IV. may also from time to time, at
   the discretion of the Committee, be made from among eminent members of
   the Ministry of any of the Nonconformist Churches of Great Britain and
   Ireland, America, and the Colonies, or of the Protestant Evangelical
   Churches of the Continent. VI. The Lecturer shall hold the appointment
   for three years. VIII. The Lectures shall be published at the
   Lecturer's own expense within one year after their delivery. IX. The
   Lectures shall be delivered to the Students of the United Presbyterian
   Hall. XII. The public shall be admitted to the Lectures.

PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.

   This Third Edition is a reprint of the First and Second, with the
   exception of a few verbal corrections and alterations, and slight
   adjustments and curtailments in certain of the Notes. The analysis of
   Contents also has been abridged. The author is indebted to the Rev.
   Alexander Mair, D.D., for kindly assisting him in the correction of the
   proofs.

   Edinburgh, July 1897.

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.

   These Lectures, the first on the Kerr Foundation, are published in
   fulfilment of the conditions of the Trust under which they were
   delivered. Their publication has been delayed owing to the author's
   appointment to the Chair of Church History in the Theological College
   of the United Presbyterian Church, at the Synod of May 1891. They have
   now been made ready for the press under the burden of labour and
   anxiety connected with the preparation of a second winter's course.
   This may excuse the minor oversights which, in handling so large a mass
   of material, must inevitably occur.

   The Lectures are printed substantially as delivered in the spring of
   1891--the chief exception being that portions of the Lectures which had
   to be omitted in the spoken delivery, through the limits of time, are
   here restored in their proper connection. Material which could not
   conveniently be incorporated in the Lectures has been wrought into
   Appendices and Notes. The latter are designed to furnish not simply
   references to authorities, but illustrations, corroborations, and what
   may be termed generally "assonances" of thought, drawn from a wide
   range of literature, which it is hoped will aid the reader who is
   disposed to pursue his study of the subject further, by guiding him to
   the best sources of knowledge. Since the Lectures were delivered,
   important books have appeared, both in this country and on the
   Continent, dealing with parts or aspects of the field here traversed,
   such, e.g., among English works, as Mr. Gore's valuable Bampton
   Lectures on The Incarnation, Principal Chapman's Pre-organic Evolution,
   Mr. Kennedy's Donnellan Lectures on Natural Theology and Modern
   Thought. Occasional references to these and some other works are
   likewise included in the Notes.

   The author's best thanks are due to the Rev. Professor Johnston, D.D.,
   of the United Presbyterian College, and to the Rev. Thomas Kennedy,
   D.D., Clerk of Synod, for their kind assistance in the revision of the
   proofs.

   Edinburgh, February l893.

   Sketch of the Christian View.--

   LECTURE II.

   The Christian View and Its Alternatives.--

   Introductory--

   Central place of Christ's Person in His religion.

   Method of this Lecture--appeal to history; logical movement in history.

   Second alternative--A Divine Christ or Agnosticism.

   Third alternative--A Divine Christ or Pessimism.

   II. The upward movement from Pessimism to Christ.

   APPENDIX TO LECTURE II.

   The Pessimism of Scepticism.--

   LECTURE III.

   The Theistic Postulate of the Christian View.--

   Introductory--

   Christianity a theistic system.

   The strength of Christian Theism--its connection with Revelation.

   This first postulate of the Christian view--how related to modern
   thought?

   I. The negation of the Christian view.

   The Agnostic negation--why so regarded?

   1. It negates the Christian view of God as self-revealing.

   2. The denial of evidence of God's existence tantamount to denial of
   His existence.

   Mr. Spencer's admission of the Ultimate Reality or Power; criticism of
   his view.

   Development of the system by Mr. Fiske into Theism.

   II. Positive evidence for the Christian view.

   1. Concessions of the evolutionary philosophy.

   The term "Personal" as applied to God.

   2. This theoretic "proofs" for the existence of God--how far valid?

   (1) The cosmological argument.

   The religious experience corresponding to this proof--the consciousness
   of absolute dependence.

   (2) The teleological or design argument.

   Argument against design from evolution.

   Two views of evolution: criticism.

   Wider form of this argument (order, plan, law, etc.).

   (3) The ontological argument.

   The Anselmic form and Kant's criticism.

   New form of this argument Rational Realism.

   The religious experience corresponding to the teleological and
   ontological argument's--sense of the Divine in nature.

   III. The moral argument--contrast with theoretic proofs.

   God a postulate of the "practical reason."

   Religious experience corresponding to the moral proof.

   APPENDIX TO LECTURE III.

   God as Religious Postulate--

   LECTURE IV.

   The Postulate of the Christian View or the World in Regard to Nature
   and Man.--

   Introductory--

   Second postulate of the Christian view: man made in the image of God.

   The doctrine of man closely linked with the doctrine of nature.

   I. The natural basis--the doctrine of creation.

   The consonance of this doctrine with reason: three oppositions--

   The opposition of Dualism (Martineau, Mill), etc.

   The opposition of Pantheism: logical derivation of the universe
   (Spinoza, Hegel, etc.).

   The opposition of Atheism: self-existence and eternity of the world.

   Evidences of a beginning

   Difficulties of the doctrine of creation in time.

   Proposed solutions of these difficulties.

   The motive and end of creation (Kant, Lotze, etc.).

   II. The nature of man, and his place in creation: man the final cause
   of the world.

   Man the link between the natural and the spiritual.

   Man as bearing the image of God.

   The potential infinitude of man's nature.

   Materialism and consciousness--

   1.Grosser form of Materialism: mind and brain identified (Moleschott,
   Vogt, etc.).

   2.Newer form of Materialism: Monism (Strauss, Haeckel, etc.).

   Ambiguity of the term "matter" in Tyndall, etc.

   Refutation of Materialism: matter itself needs thought to explain it.

   III. Man as made in the image of God constituted for immortality.

   Modern rejection of doctrine of a future life.

   If man constituted for immortality, the fact must show itself in his
   nature and capacities.

   1. Universal prevalence of belief in a future state. Spencer's theory;
   its inadequacy.

   2. Rational grounds for this belief : nature of evidence.

   Conclusion.

   LECTURE V.

   The Postulate of the Christian View in Regard to the Sin and Disorder
   of the World.--

   Introductory--

   Third postulate of the Christian view: the sin and disorder of the
   world. Christianity does not create the problem of natural and moral
   evil, but helps to solve it.

   I. The problem of moral evil: conflict of Christian and modern views.

   Respects in which the modern view comes to the support of the Christian
   view.

   Fundamental difference between the Christian and the modern view.

   Sin in the Christian view not something natural, necessary, and normal,
   but the result of a free act of the creature.

   Theories of sin opposed to the Christian view--

   1. Theories which seek the ground of evil in the constitution of the
   world.

   2. Theories which seek the explanation of evil in the nature of man.

   Sin in all these theories made something necessary.

   Weakening or destruction of idea of guilt.

   Differences between the Christian and the modern view depend on theory
   of origin.

   Theory of man's original brutishness--relation to narrative of the
   Fall.

   Relation of Christian view to modern theories of the antiquity of man.

   Science does not negative the idea of a pure beginning of the race: the
   Biblical account of primeval man.

   II. The problem of natural evil: connection with moral evil.

   Natural evil in the inorganic world.

   Natural evil in the organic world.

   The question altered when we come to self-conscious, rational man.

   Connection of natural evil with sin: nature and admissibility of this
   connection.

   The Pauline view: what it implies.

   III. Culmination of this problem in the question of the relation of sin
   to death.

   Man created for immortality.

   Death the sundering of essential parts of his being: therefore
   abnormal.

   The true immortality is through Redemption, and embraces the
   resurrection of the body.

   APPENDIX TO LECTURE V.

   The Old Testament Doctrine of Immortality.--

   LECTURE VI.

   The Central Assertion of the Christian View: The Incarnation of God in
   Christ.--

   Introductory--

   Completion of argument in second Lecture.

   A priori objection to the Incarnation based on Christ's lowliness.

   I. Testimony of the apostolic age as throwing light on Christ's own
   claims.

   Modern agreement as to general teaching of New Testament--the Johannine
   writings.

   The Epistles of Paul--

   1. The undisputed Epistles--the " Heavenly Man" theory.

   2. The later Epistles -- Christology of Philippians, Colossians, etc.

   The Epistle to the Hebrews an independent witness.

   The doctrine of the Apocalypse as high as John's or Paul's (Reuss,
   Pfleiderer).

   The Petrine and Minor Epistles.

   Discourses in the Acts.

   Conclusion:--The supernatural view of Christ's Person established in
   first generation of believers.

   II. The testimony of the Gospels--Christ in the Fourth Gospel.

   The Christ of the Synoptics also a supernatural Being.

   1. The claims of Jesus--the titles "Son of Man," and "Son of God"--His
   eschatological claims, etc.

   2. Representation of the character of Christ--His sinlessness.

   3. The works of Jesus in keeping with His claims.

   4. The resurrection of Jesus--the Trinitarian formula, etc.

   The Synoptic representation of Christ in keeping with the apostolic
   estimate of His Person.

   Conclusion:--The facts of Christ's Revelation require the supernatural
   view of His Person: impossibility of evading this claim.

   III. Doctrinal aspects of the Incarnation: proposed reconstructions.

   In what sense modern theories ascribe "Godhead" to Christ.

   1. Are these theories tenable on their own merits?

   2. Do these theories do justice to the facts of Christ's Revelation?

   What is not, and what is, true Incarnation.

   3. Consideration of Kenotic theories (Phil. ii. 7).

   Relation of preceding discussion to the early Christological decisions.

   Advances in modern speculation.

   The question of the impersonality of Christ's humanity.

   The Incarnation to be studied in the light of its revealed ends.

   APPENDIX TO LECTURE VI.

   The Self-Consciousness of Jesus.--

   LECTURE VII.

   Higher Concept of God Involved in the Incarnation--The Incarnation and
   the Plan of the World.--

   Introductory--

   Recapitulation of defective theories.

   I. Higher concept of God involved in the Incarnation--God as triune.

   This doctrine the result of an induction from the facts of Revelation.

   How far this doctrine is anticipated in the Old Testament.

   This doctrine of the Trinity as involving distinctions in the Divine
   essence.

   Objection on this score--"One and Three."

   Drawbacks of the word "Person" need of the expression.

   Proof that distinctions of this kind are implied.

   Alternative view an economical Trinity.

   Relations of the doctrine to rational thought.

   Psychological analogies in Augustine and others.

   Relation of the doctrine to self-consciousness, etc.

   1. The deduction from knowledge.

   2. The deduction from love.

   3. Deduction from the Divine Fatherhood--God eternally Father.

   4. Bearing of the Trinity on God's relation to the world --safeguard
   against Deism and Pantheism.

   II. The Scripture view brings creation and Redemption into
   line--consequences of this.

   Relation of the Incarnation to the plan of the world.

   World there have been an Incarnation had man not sinned.

   History of the question.

   Strong point against this theory--the constant connection of
   Incarnation with Redemption.

   Difficulty arises from too abstract a view of the Divine plan.

   Great weight on this question to be attached to the revealed end--the
   gathering up of all things in Christ.

   Harmony of Scripture with this view--

   1. The Scriptures know of only one undivided purpose of God.

   2. They assert a direct relation of the Son with creation.

   3. They represent Christ as the final cause of creation.

   4. God's purpose actually tends to the unification of all things in
   Christ.

   Summary and conclusion.

   LECTURE VIII.

   The Incarnation and Redemption from Sin.--

   Introductory--

   Christianity a religion of Redemption.

   Special question--The connection of Redemption with the sufferings and
   death of Christ.

   I. Scripture testimony on this subject--the apostolic witness.

   Does Christ's teaching agree with that of the apostles?

   Proof that Christ attached a redemptive significance to His death.

   Grounds on which the apostolic Church proceeded--

   1. The objective facts of Christ's death, resurrection, etc.

   2. Christ's sayings on the meaning and necessity of His death.

   3. The teaching of the Old Covenant as throwing light on Christ's work.

   II. Explanation of the redemptive significance of Christ's
   death--theories of Atonement.

   Modern desire to connect the Atonement with spiritual laws.

   The Atonement considered from the point of view of the Incarnation.

   Points taken for granted in all Christian theories of Redemption.

   Theories differ as they attach themselves to one or another of these
   points.

   1. Theories of fellowship: Schleiermacher, etc.

   2. Theories based on idea of sympathy: Bushnell.

   Points in which this theory comes short.

   Dr. Bushnell's later modification of his view.

   3. Theories based on idea of vocation: Ritschl.

   Theories which recognise an objective element in the Atonement: in what
   does it consist?

   4. Theories based on idea of self-surrender of holy will to God:
   Maurice, etc.

   5. Theories which recognise a relation to guilt: Campbell's theory of
   vicarious repentance and confession.

   Deeper elements in Campbell's view--the "Amen" in response to God's
   judgment on sin.

   Christ's sufferings viewed as expiatory.

   Objections to this view--the innocent suffering for the guilty.

   The real question--How should such sufferings become expiatory for
   others?

   Recapitulation and conclusion.

   LECTURE IX.

   The Incarnation and Human Destiny.--

   Introductory--

   Necessity of an eschatology.

   The Christian view eschatological because teleological.

   I. The astronomical objection to Christianity.

   The objection a quantitative one.

   The bearing of sin on this question.

   The issues of Redemption not confined to this planet.

   II. Principles of interpretation of eschatological prophecy.

   The nearer aim of Christianity--the coming of the kingdom of God on
   earth.

   History has its goal--transition to eschatology proper.

   The positive and bright side of the Christian view.

   1. The aim of God is conformity to the image of the Son.

   2. This includes likeness to His glorious body: the resurrection.

   3. The perfecting of the Church carries with it the perfecting of
   nature.

   Pictorial and scenic elements--

   1. The personal Advent--how to be interpreted?

   The Coming a process in which many elements flow together.

   Still, a personal Coming is implied.

   1. The general Judgment.

   Its certainty.

   Parabolic character of descriptions.

   III. The dark side of this question--the destiny of the wicked.

   Three theories on this subject--

   1. Dogmatic Universalism.

   2. The doctrine of Annihilation: Conditional Immortality.

   3. The doctrine of Eternal Punishment.

   Fundamental positions laid down--

   1. The principle of certain retribution for sin.

   2. Need for distinguishing between what Scripture teaches and subjects
   on which it is simply silent.

   3. A larger calculus needed than we at present possess.

   Criticism of theories--

   1. Scripture does not warrant dogmatic Universalism.

   2. Scripture does not warrant Annihilation.

   Theory of "Conditional Immortality" criticised.

   3. The theory of Future Probation.

   Facts which suggest caution--

   (1) Concentration of every ray of exhortation and appeal into the
   present.

   (2) The judgment invariably represented as proceeding on the data of
   this life.

   (3) The silence of Scripture on future probation: limits of the
   application of 1 Pet. iii. 19, 20; iv. 6.

   Result--We have not the elements of a complete solution.

   CONCLUSION OF LECTURES.

                    The Christian View of God and the World

by James Orr

   "Jesus Christ is the centre of all, and the goal to which all
   tends."--PASCAL.

   "If we carry back the antagonisms of the present to their ultimate
   principle, we are obliged to confess that it is of a religious kind.
   The way in which a man thinks of God and the world, and their relation
   to one another, is decisive for the whole tendency of his thought, and
   even in the questions of the purely natural life."--Luthardt.

   "The Christian truth, with the certifying of which we have to do, is
   essentially only one, compact in itself, vitally interconnected, as
   such at the same time organic,--and it is therefore not possible one
   should possess and retain a portion of the same, while yet not
   possessing, or rejecting, the other portions. On the contrary, the
   member or portion of the truth, which it had been thought to
   appropriate or maintain alone, would by this isolating cease to be that
   which it was or is in itself; it would become an empty form or husk,
   from which the life, the Christian reality, has escaped."--F. H. R.
   Frank.

   "In no case can true Reason and a right Faith oppose each
   other."--Coleridge.

LECTURE I.

  THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF THE WORLD IN GENERAL.

    Introductory

   I Might briefly define the object of the present Lectures by saying
   that they aim at the exhibition, and, as far as possible within the
   limits assigned me, at the rational vindication, of what I have called
   in the title, "The Christian View of the World." This expression,
   however, is itself one which calls for definition and explanation, and
   I proceed, in the first place, to give the explanation that is needed.

   The Idea of the "Weltanschauung."

   A reader of the higher class of works in German theology--especially
   those that deal with the philosophy of religion--cannot fail to be
   struck with the constant recurrence of a word for which he finds it
   difficult to get a precise equivalent in English. It is the word
   "Weltanschauung," sometimes interchanged with another compound of the
   same signification, "Weltansicht." Both words mean literally "view of
   the world," but whereas the phrase in English is limited by
   associations which connect it predominatingly with physical nature, in
   German the word is not thus limited, but has almost the force of a
   technical term, denoting the widest view which the mind can take of
   things in the effort to grasp them together as a whole from the
   standpoint of some particular philosophy or theology. To speak,
   therefore, of a "Christian view of the world" implies that Christianity
   also has its highest point of view, and its view of life connected
   therewith, and that this, when developed, constitutes an ordered whole.
   [1]

   To some the subject which I have thus chosen may seem unduly wide and
   vague. I can only reply that I have deliberately chosen it for this
   very reason, that it enables me to deal with Christianity in its
   entirety or as a system, instead of dealing with particular aspects or
   doctrines of it. Both methods have their advantages; but no one I
   think, whose eyes are open to the signs of the times, can fail to
   perceive that if Christianity is to be effectually defended from the
   attacks made upon it, it is the comprehensive method which is rapidly
   becoming the more urgent. The opposition which Christianity has to
   encounter is no longer confined to special doctrines or to points of
   supposed conflict with the natural sciences,--for example, the
   relations of Genesis and geology,--but extends to the whole manner of
   conceiving of the world, and of man's place in it, the manner of
   conceiving of the entire system of things, natural and moral, of which
   we form a part. It is no longer an opposition of detail, but of
   principle. This circumstance necessitates an equal extension of the
   line of the defence. It is the Christian view of things in general
   which is attacked, and it is by an exposition and vindication of the
   Christian view of things as a whole that the attack can most
   successfully be met.

   Everything here, of course, depends on the view we take of Christianity
   itself. The view indicated in the title is that which has its centre in
   the Divine and human Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. It implies the
   true Divinity as well as the true humanity of the Christian Redeemer.
   This is a view of Christianity, I know, which I am not at liberty to
   take for granted, but must be prepared in due course to vindicate. I
   shall not shrink from the task which this imposes on me, but would only
   at present point out that, for him who does accept it, a very definite
   view of things emerges. He who with his whole heart believes in Jesus
   as the Son of God is thereby committed to much else besides. He is
   committed to a view of God, to a view of man, to a view of sin, to a
   view of Redemption, to a view of the purpose of God in creation and
   history, to a view of human destiny, found only in Christianity. This
   forms a "Weltanschauung," or "Christian view of the world," which
   stands in marked contrast within theories wrought out from a purely
   philosophical or scientific standpoint.

   The idea of the "Weltanschauung" may be said to have entered
   prominently into modern thought through the influence of Kant, who
   derives what he calls the "Weltbegriff" from the second of his Ideas of
   Pure Reason to which is assigned the function of the systematic
   connection of all our experiences into a unity of a world-whole
   (Weltganz). [2] But the thing itself is as old as the dawn of
   reflection, and is found in a cruder or more advanced form in every
   religion and philosophy with any pretensions to a historical character.
   The simplest form in which we meet with it is in the rude, tentative
   efforts at a general explanation of things in the cosmogonies and
   theogonies of most ancient religions, the mythological character of
   which need not blind us to the rational motive which operates in them.
   [3] With the growth of philosophy, a new type of world-view is
   developed--that which attempts to explain the universe as a system by
   the help of some general principle or principles (water, air, number,
   etc.), accompanied by the use of terms which imply the conception of an
   All or Whole of things (ta panta, kosmos--attributed to the
   Pythagoreans--mundus, universum, etc.) [4] An example from ancient
   thought may be given from Lucretius, who, in his famous poem, "De Rerum
   Natura," proposes "to discourse of the most high system of heaven and
   the gods, and to open up the first-beginnings of things, out of which
   nature gives birth to all things and increase and nourishment, and into
   which nature likewise resolves them back after their destruction." [5]
   The outlines of his system are well known. By the aid of certain first
   principles atoms and the void and of certain assumed laws of motion and
   development, he seeks to account for the existing universe, and
   constructs for himself a theory on the lines of Epicurus which he
   thinks satisfies his intellectual necessities. This is his
   Weltanschauung--the progeny of which is seen in the materialistic
   systems of the present day. A modern example may be taken from the
   philosophy of Comte, which, theoretically one of pure phenomenalism,
   only the more strikingly illustrates the necessity which thought is
   under to attempting some form a synthesis of its experience. Comte's
   standpoint is that of despair of absolute knowledge. Yet he recognises
   the tendency in the mind which prompts it to organise its knowledge,
   and thinks it possible to construct a scheme of existence which shall
   give practical unity to life--imagination eking out the deficiencies of
   the intellect. In the words of a recent interpreter, "Beneath and
   beyond all the details in our ideas of things, there is a certain
   esprit d'ensemble, a general conception of the world without and the
   world within, in which these details gather to a head." [6] It would
   not be easy to get a better description of what is meant by a
   "Weltanschauung" than in these words. The centre of unity in this new
   conception of the universe is Man. Knowledge is to be organised solely
   with reference to its bearings on the well-being and progress of
   Humanity. A religion even is provided for the satisfaction of the
   emotional and imaginative wants of man in the worship of the same
   abstraction--Humanity, which is to be viewed with affection and
   gratitude as a beneficent providence interposed between man and the
   hard pressure of his outward conditions. In a moral respect the
   individual is to find his all-comprehensive end in the "service of
   Humanity." Thus, again, we have a "Weltanschauung" in which knowledge
   and action are knit up together, and organised into a single view of
   life.

   The causes which lead to the formation of "Weltanschauungen," that is,
   of general theories of the universe, explanatory of what it is, how it
   has come to be what it is, and whither it tends, lie deep in the
   constitution of human nature. They are twofold--speculative and
   practical, corresponding to the twofold aspect of human nature as
   thinking and active. On the theoretical side, the mind seeks unity in
   its representations. It is not content with fragmentary knowledge, but
   tends constantly to rise from facts to laws, from laws to higher laws,
   from these to the highest generalisations possible. [7] Ultimately it
   abuts on questions of origin, purpose, and destiny, which as questions
   set by reason to itself, it cannot, from its very nature refuse at
   least to attempt to answer. [8] Even to prove that an answer to them is
   impossible, it is found necessary to discuss them, and it will be
   strange if, in the course of the discussion, the discovery is not made,
   that underneath the profession of nescience a positive theory of some
   kind after all lurks. [9] But there is likewise a practical motive
   urging to the consideration of these well-worn questions of the why,
   whence, and whither? Looking out on the universe, men cannot but desire
   to know their place in the system of things of which they form a part,
   if only that they may know how rightly to determine themselves thereto
   [10] Is the constitution of things good or evil? By what ultimate
   principles ought man to be guided in the framing and ordering of his
   life? What is the true end of existence? What rational justification
   does the nature of things afford for the higher sentiments of duty and
   religion? If it be the case, as the Agnostic affirms, that light
   absolutely fails us on questions of origin, cause, and end, what
   conception of life remains? Or, assuming that no higher origin for life
   and mind can be postulated than matter and force what revision is
   necessary of current conceptions of private morality and social duty?

   It is a singular circumstance that, with all the distaste of the age
   for metaphysics, the tendency to the formation of world-systems, or
   general theories of the universe, was never more powerful than at the
   present day. One cause of this, no doubt, is the feeling which modern
   science itself has done so much to engender, of the unity which
   pervades all orders of existence. The naive Polytheism of pagan times,
   when every hill and fountain was supposed to have its special divinity,
   is no longer possible with modern notions of the coherence of the
   universe. Everywhere the minds of men are opening to the conception
   that, whatever else the universe is, it is one--one set of laws holds
   the whole together--one order reigns through all. Everywhere,
   accordingly, we see a straining after a universal point of view--a
   grouping and grasping of things together in their unity. [11] The
   philosophy of Mr. Spencer, for example, is as truly an attempt at the
   unification of all knowledge as the philosophy of a Hegel; the
   evolutionist is as confident of being able to embrace all that is, or
   ever has been, or will be--all existing phenomena of nature, history,
   or mind--in the range of a few ultimate formulas, as if he had already
   seen how the task was to be accomplished; the Comtist urges to an
   imaginative in default of a real and objective synthesis, and rears on
   this basis at once a social theory and religion. The mind, grows bolder
   with the advance of knowledge, and hopes, if not to reach a final
   solution of the ultimate mystery of existence, at least to bring
   thoroughly under its dominion the sphere of the knowable." [12]

   What now, it may be asked, has Christianity to do with theories, and
   questions, and speculations of this sort? As a doctrine of salvation,
   perhaps, not much, but in its logical presuppositions and consequences
   a great deal indeed. Christianity, it is granted, is not a scientific
   system, though, if its views of the world be true, it must be
   reconcilable with all that is certain and established in the results of
   science. It is not a philosophy, though, if it be valid, its
   fundamental assumptions will be found to be in harmony with the
   conclusions at which sound reason, attacking its own problems,
   independently arrives. It is a religion, historical in its origin, and
   claiming to rest on Divine Revelation. But though Christianity is
   neither a scientific system, nor a philosophy, it has yet a world-view
   of its own, to which it stands committed, alike by its fundamental
   postulate of a personal, holy, self-revealing God, and by its content
   as a religion of Redemption which, therefore, necessarily brings it
   into comparison with the world-views already referred to. [13] It has
   as every religions should and must have, its own peculiar
   interpretation to give of the facts of existence; its own way of look
   in at, and accounting for, the existing natural and moral order; its
   own idea of a world--aim, and of that "one far-off Divine event," to
   which, through slow and painful travail, "the whole creation moves."
   [14] As thus binding together the natural and moral worlds in their
   highest unity, through reference to their ultimate principle, God it
   involves a "Weltanschauung."

   It need not further be denied that between this view of the world
   involved in Christianity, and what is sometimes termed "the modern view
   of the world" there exists a deep and radical antagonism. [15] This so
   called "modern view of the world," indeed, and it is important to
   observe it, is strictly speaking, not one view, but many view, a group
   of views--most of them as exclusive of one another as they together are
   of Christianity. [16] The phrase, nevertheless, does point to a
   homogeneity of these, various systems to a bond of unity which runs
   through them all and holds them together in spite of their many
   differences. This common feature is their thoroughgoing opposition to
   the supernatural,--at least of the specifically miraculous, their
   refusal to recognise anything in nature, life, or history, outside the
   lines of natural development. Between such a view of the world and
   Christianity, it is perfectly correct to say that there can be no
   kindredship. Those who think otherwise speculative Theists, e.g., like
   Pfleiderer can only make good their contention by fundamentally
   altering the idea of Christianity it self--robbing it also of its
   miraculous essence and accompaniments. Whether this is tenable we shall
   consider afterwards. Meanwhile it is to be noted that this at least is
   not the Christianity of the New Testament. It may be an improved and
   purified form of Christianity, but it is not the Christianity of Christ
   and His apostles. Even if, with the newer criticism, we distinguish
   between the theology of Christ and that of His apostles--between the
   Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John--between the earlier form of
   the synoptic tradition and supposed later embellishments--it is still
   not to be disputed that, in the simplest view we can take of it, Jesus
   held and acted on a view of things totally different from the
   rationalistic conception; while for him who accepts the view of
   Christianity indicated in the title of these Lectures, it has already
   been pointed out that a view of things emerges with which the denial of
   the supernatural is wholly incompatible.

   The position here taken, that the question at issue between the
   opponents and defenders of the Christian view of the world at bottom
   the question of the supernatural, needs to be guarded against a not
   uncommon misconception. A good deal of controversy has recently taken
   place in regard to certain statements of Professor Max MÃ¼ller, as to
   whether "miracles" are essential to Christianity. [17] But the issue we
   have to face is totally misconceived when it is turned into a question
   of belief in this or that particular miracle--or of miracles in
   general--regarded as mere external appendages to Christianity. The
   question is not about isolated "miracles," but about the whole
   conception of Christianity--what it is, and whether the supernatural
   does not enter into the very essence of it? It is the general question
   of a supernatural or non-supernatural conception of the universe. Is
   there a supernatural Being--God? Is there a supernatural government of
   the world? Is there a supernatural relation of God and man, so that God
   and man may have communion with one another? Is there a supernatural
   Revelation? Has that Revelation culminated in a supernatural
   Person--Christ? Is there a supernatural work in the souls of men? Is
   there a supernatural Redemption? Is there a supernatural hereafter? It
   is these larger questions that have to be settled first, and then the
   question of particular miracles will fall into its proper place.
   Neander has given admirable expression to the conception of
   Christianity which is really at stake, in the following words in the
   commencement of his History of the Church--"Now we look upon
   Christianity not as a power that has sprung up out of the hidden depths
   of man s nature, but as one that descended from above, when heaven
   opened itself anew to man's long alienated race; a power which, as both
   in its origin and its essence it is exalted above all that human nature
   can create out of its own resources, was designed to impart to that
   nature a new life, and to change it in its inmost principles. The prime
   source of this power is He whose power exhibits to us the manifestation
   of it--Jesus of Nazareth--the Redeemer of mankind when estranged from
   God by sin. In the devotion of faith in Him, and the appropriation of
   the truth which He revealed, consists the essence of Christianity and
   of that fellowship of the Divine life resulting from it, which we
   designate by the name of the Church." [18] It is this conception of
   Christianity we have to come to an understanding with, before the
   question of particular miracles can profitably be discussed.

   While, from the nature of the case this side of opposition of the
   Christian view of the world to certain "modern" conceptions must
   necessarily receive prominence I ought, on the other hand, to remark
   that it is far from my intention to represent the relation of
   Christianity to these opposing systems as one of mere negation. This
   would be to overlook the fact, which cannot be too carefully borne in
   mind, that no theory which has obtained wide currency, and held
   powerful sway over the minds of men, is ever wholly false; that, on the
   contrary, it derives what strength it has from some side or aspect of
   truth which it embodies, and for which it is in Providence a witness
   against the suppression or denial of it in some countertheory, or in
   the general doctrine of the age. No duty is more imperative on the
   Christian teacher than that of showing that instead of Christianity
   being simply one theory among the rest, it is really the higher truth
   which is the synthesis and completion of all the other, that view
   which, rejecting the error, takes up the vitalising elements in all
   other systems and religions, and unites them into a living organism
   with Christ as head. [19] We are reminded of Milton's famous figure in
   the "Areopagitica," of the dismemberment of truth,--how truth was torn
   limb from limb, and her members were scattered to the four winds; and
   how the lovers of truth, imitating the careful search of Isis for the
   body of Osiris, have been engaged ever since in gathering together the
   severed parts, in order to unite them again into a perfect whole. [20]
   If apologetic is to be spoken of, this surely is the truest and best
   form of Christian apology--to show that in Christianity, as nowhere
   else, the severed portions of truth found in all other systems are
   organically united, while it completes the body of truth by discoveries
   peculiar to itself. The Christian doctrine of God, for example, may
   fairly claim to be the synthesis of all the separate elements of truth
   found in Agnosticism, Pantheism, and Deism, which by their very
   antagonisms reveal themselves as one-sidednesses, requiring to be
   brought into some higher harmony. If Agnosticism affirms that there is
   that in God--in His infinite and absolute existence--which transcends
   finite comprehension, Christian theology does the same. If Pantheism
   affirms the absolute immanence of God in the world, and Deism His
   absolute transcendence over it, Christianity unites the two sides of
   the truth in a higher concept, maintaining at the same time the Divine
   immanence and the Divine transcendence. [21] Even Polytheism in its
   nobler forms is in its own dark way a witness for a truth which a hard,
   abstract Monotheism, such as we have in the later (not the Biblical)
   Judaism, and in Mohammedanism, ignores--the truth, namely, that God is
   plurality as well as unity--that in Him there is a manifoldness of
   life, a fulness and diversity of powers and manifestations, such as is
   expressed by the word Elohim. This element of truth in Polytheism
   Christianity also takes up, and sets in its proper relation to the
   unity of God in its doctrine of Tri-unity--the concept of God which is
   distinctively the Christian one, and which furnishes the surest
   safeguard of a living Theism against the extremes of both Pantheism and
   Deism. [22] Optimism and Pessimism are an other pair of contrasts--each
   in abstraction an error, yet each a witness for a truth which the other
   overlooks, and Christianity is the reconciliation of both. To take a
   last example, Positivism a very direct negation of Christianity; yet in
   its strange "worship of Humanity" is there not that which stretches
   across the gulf and touches hands with a religion which meets the
   cravings of the heart for the human in God by the doctrine of the
   Incarnation? It is the province of a true and wise Christian theology
   to take account of all this, and to seek, with ever increasing
   enlargement of vision, the comprehensive view in which all factors of
   the truth are combined. The practical inference I would draw--the very
   opposite of that drawn by others from the same premises--is, that it is
   the unwisest way possible of dealing with Christianity to pare it down,
   or seek to sublimate it away, as if it had no positive content of its
   own; or, by lavish compromise and concession, to part with that which
   belongs to its essence. It is not in a blunted and toned down
   Christianity, but in the exhibition of the Christian view in the
   greatest fulness and completeness possible, that the ultimate synthesis
   of the conflicting elements in the clash of systems around us is to be
   found.

   Relation of Christianity to world-theories.

   This is perhaps the place to point out that, whatever the character of
   the world-view involved in Christianity, it is not one in all respects
   absolutely new. It rests upon, and carries forward to its completion,
   the richly concrete view of the world already found in the Old
   Testament. As an able expounder of Old Testament theology, Hermann
   Schultz, has justly said--"There is absolutely no New Testament view
   which does not approve itself as a sound and definitive formation from
   an Old Testament germ--no truly Old Testament view which did not
   inwardly press forward to its New Testament fulfilment." [23] This is a
   phenomenon which, I think, has not always received the attention it
   deserves. What are the main characteristics of this Old Testament
   conception? At its root is the idea of a holy, spiritual,
   self-revealing God, the free Creator of the world, and its continual
   Preserver. As correlative to this, and springing out of it, is the idea
   of man as a being made in God's image, and capable of moral relations
   and spiritual fellowship with his Maker; but who, through sin, has
   turned aside from the end of his creation, and stands in need of
   Redemption. In the heart of the history, we have the idea of a Divine
   purpose, working itself out through the calling of a special nation,
   for the ultimate benefit and blessing of mankind. God's providential
   rule extends over all creatures and events, and embraces all peoples of
   the earth, near and remote. In view of the sin and corruption that have
   overspread the world, His government is one of combined mercy and
   judgment; and His dealings with Israel in particular are preparative to
   the introduction of a better economy, in which the grace already
   partially exhibited will be fully revealed. The end is the
   establishment of a kingdom of God under the rule of the Messiah, in
   which all national limitations will be removed, the Spirit be poured
   forth, and Jehovah will become the God of the whole earth. God will
   make a new covenant with His people, and will write His laws by His
   Spirit in their hearts. Under this happy reign the final triumph of
   righteousness over sin will be accomplished, and death and all other
   evils will be abolished. Here is a very remarkable "Weltanschauung,"
   the presence of which at all in the pages of the Hebrew Scriptures is a
   fact of no ordinary significance. In the comparative history of
   religions, it stands quite unique. [24] Speculations on the world and
   its origin are seen growing up in the schools of philosophy; but on the
   ground of religion there is nothing to compare with this. The lower
   religions, Fetishism and the like, have of course nothing of the nature
   of a developed world-view. The rudiments of such a view in the older
   nature-religions are crude, confused, polytheistic--mixed up abundantly
   with mythological elements. Brahmanism and Buddhism rest on a
   metaphysical foundation; they are as truly philosophical systems as the
   atomistic or pantheistic theories of the Greek schools, or the systems
   of Schopenhauer and Hartmann in our own day. And the philosophy they
   inculcate is a philosophy of despair; they contain no spring of hope or
   progress. Zoroastrianism, with its profound realisation of the conflict
   of good and evil in the universe, perhaps comes nearest to the religion
   of the Old Testament, yet is severed from it by an immense gulf. I
   refer only to its pervading dualism, its reverence for physical
   elements, its confusion of natural and moral evil--above all, to its
   total lack of the idea of historical Revelation. [25] The Biblical
   conception is separated from every other by its monotheistic basis, its
   unique clearness, its organic unity, its moral character, and its
   teleological aim. [26] It does not matter for the purposes of this
   argument what dates we assign to the books of the Old Testament in
   which these views are found whether we attribute them, with the critics
   to the age of the prophets, or to any other. These views are at least
   there many centuries before the Christian age began and they are found
   nowhere else than on the soil of Israel. This is the singular fact the
   critic has to face, and we cannot profess to wonder that, impartially
   studying it, voices should be heard from the midst of the advanced
   school itself unhesitatingly declaring, Date your books when you will,
   this religion is not explicable save on the hypothesis of Revelation!
   [27]

   General drift and scope of the Lectures.

   The general drift and object of these Lectures should now, I think, be
   apparent. From the conditions of this Lectureship I am precluded from
   directly entering the apologetic field. I feel, however, that it would
   be useless to discuss any important theological subject at the present
   day without reference to the thought and speculation of the time. No
   other mode of thought would enable me to do justice to the Christian
   position, and none, I think, would be so interesting to those for whom
   the Lectures are primarily intended. This, however, will be subsidiary
   to the main design of showing that there is a definite Christian view
   of things, which has a character, coherence, and unity of its own, and
   stands in sharp contrast with counter theories and speculations, and
   that this world-view has the stamp of reason and reality upon itself,
   and can amply justify itself at the bar both of history and of ex
   experience. I shall endeavour to show that the Christian view of thing
   forms a logical whole which cannot be infringed on, or accepted or
   rejected piecemeal, but stands or falls in its integrity, and can only
   suffer from attempts at amalgamation or compromise with theories which
   rest on totally distinct bases. I hope thus to make clear at least the
   true nature of the issues involved in a comparison of the Christian and
   "modern" views, and I shall be glad if I can in any way contribute to
   the elucidation of the former.

   Objections in limine

   Two objections may be taken in limine to the course I propose to
   follow, and it is proper at this stage that I should give them some
   attention.

   I. From theology of feeling.

   I. The first objection is taken from the standpoint of the theology of
   feeling, and amounts to a denial of our right to speak of a Christian
   "Weltanschauung" at all; indeed, to assume that Christianity has a
   definite doctrinal content of any kind. [28] This class of objectors
   would rule the cognitive element out of religion altogether. Religion,
   it is frequently alleged, has nothing to do with notions of the
   intellect, but only with states and dispositions of the heart. Theories
   and doctrines are no essential part of it, but, on the contrary, a bane
   and injury and hindrance to its free development and progress. Those
   who speak thus sometimes do so in the interests of a theory which would
   seek the essence of religion in certain instincts, or sentiments, or
   emotions, which are supposed to be universal and indestructible in the
   human race, and to constitute the imperishable and undecaying substance
   of all religions--the emotions, e.g., of awe or wonder, or reverence or
   dependence, awakened by the impression of the immensity or mystery of
   the universe; while the and beliefs connected with these emotions are
   regarded as but the accidents of a particular stage of culture, and as
   possessing no independent value. They are at best the variegated moulds
   into which this emotional life of the spirit has for the time being
   poured itself--the envelopes and vehicles through which it seeks for
   itself preservation and expression. All religions, from this impartial
   standpoint, Christianity included, are equally Divine and equally
   human. But even those who recognise a higher origin for the Christian
   religion sometimes speak of it as if in its original form it was devoid
   of all definite doctrinal content; or at least as if the doctrinal
   ideas found in connection with it were only external wrappage and
   covering, and could be stripped off--altered, manipulated, modified, or
   dispensed with at the pleasure of the critic--without detriment to the
   moral and spiritual kernel beneath. [29] Christianity is not given up,
   but there is the attempt to refine and sublimate it till it is reduced
   to a simple state of sentiment and feeling; to purge it of the
   theoretic element till nothing is left but the vaguest residuum of
   doctrinal opinion. Agreeing with this party in their aversion to
   doctrine, yet occupying a distinct standpoint, are the
   ultra-spirituals, whose naturally mystical bent of mind, and fondness
   for the hazy and indefinite in theological as in other thinking,
   predispose them to dwell in the region of cloudy and undefined
   conceptions.

   It scarcely falls within my province to inquire how far this theory
   holds good in its general application to religion, though even on this
   broad field it might easily be shown that it involves a number of
   untenable assumptions, and really contradicts the idea of religion. For
   what is meant by the assertion that religion consists only in sentiment
   or feeling, and has nothing to do with doctrinal conceptions? Not,
   surely, that religion can subsist wholly without ideas, or cognitive
   apprehension, of some kind. Religion, in the lowest as well as in the
   highest of its forms is an expression of the relation of the soul to
   something beyond itself it involves, therefore, not one term, but two;
   it points to the existence of an object, and implies belief in the
   reality of that object. The element of idea, therefore,--or, as the
   Germans would say, "Vorstellung,"--is inseparable from it. No religion
   has ever been found which did not involve some rudiments of an
   objective view. We may learn here even from the pessimist Hartmann,
   who, in an acute analysis of the elements of religion, says, "How true
   soever it may be that religious feeling forms the innermost kernel of
   religious life, nevertheless that only is a true religious feeling
   which is excited through religious representations having a character
   of objective (if only relative) truth. Religion cannot exist without a
   religious "Weltanschauung," and this not without the conviction of its
   transcendental truth." [30]

   Nor, again, can it be contended that, while a cognitive element of some
   kind must be conceded, religion is indifferent to the character of its
   ideas--that these have no influence upon the state of sentiment or
   feelings. The religion of a Thug, e.g., is a very different thing from
   the religion of a Christian; and will any one say that the ideas with
   which the two religions are associated--the ideas they respectively
   entertain of their deities--have nothing to do with this difference? In
   what do religions differ as higher and lower, if not in the greater or
   less purity and elevation of the ideas they entertain of the Godhead,
   and the greater or less purity of the sentiment to which these ideas
   give birth?

   Nor, finally, can it be held that it is a matter of unimportance
   whether these ideas which are connected with a religion are regarded as
   true--i.e. whether they are believed to have any objective counterpart.
   For religion can as little subsist without belief in the reality of its
   object, as it can dispense with the idea of an object altogether. This
   is the weakness of subjective religious theories like Feuerbach's, in
   which religion is regarded as the projection of man s own egoistic
   consciousness into the infinite; or of those poetic and Ã¦sthetic
   theories of religion which regard the ends of religion as served if
   only it furnishes man with elevating and inspiring ideals, without
   regard to the question of how far these ideals relate to an actual
   object. Ideas on this hypothesis are necessary to religion, and may be
   ranked as higher and lower, but have only a fictitious or poetic value.
   They are products of historical evolution,--guesses, speculations,
   dreams, imaginings, of the human mind in regard to that which from the
   nature of the case is beyond the reach of direct knowledge, probably is
   unknowable. They are therefore not material out of which anything can
   be built of a scientific character; not anything that can be brought to
   an objective test; not anything verifiable. Their sole value, as said
   earlier, is to serve as vehicles and support of religious feeling. [31]
   But it is obvious that, on this view, the utility of religious ideas
   can only last so long as the illusion in connection with them is not
   dispelled. For religion is more than a mere Ã¦sthetic gratification. It
   implies belief in the existence of a real object other than self, and
   includes a desire to get into some relation with this object. The mind
   in religion is in too earnest, a mood to be put off with mere fancies.
   The moment it dawns on the thoughts of the worshipper that the object
   he worships has no reality, but is only an illusion or fancy of his
   own, the moment he is convinced that in his holiest exercises, he is
   but toying with the creations of his own spirit,--that moment the
   religious relation is at an end. Neither philosopher nor common man
   will long continue bowing down to an object in whose actual existence
   he has ceased to believe. [32] Nor is the conclusion which seems to
   follow from this--that the illusion of religion is one which the
   progress of knowledge is destined to destroy--evaded by the concession
   that there is some dim Unknowable, the consciousness of which lies at
   the basis of the religious sentiment, and which the mind can till
   please itself by clothing with the attributes of God. For what is there
   in this indefinite relation to an Unknowable, of which we can only
   affirm that it is not what we think it to be, to serve the purpose of a
   religion? And what avails it to personalise this conception of the
   Absolute, when we know, as before, that this clothing with personal
   attributes is only objective illusion?

   No objection, therefore, can fairly be taken from the side of the
   general "Science of Religions," to the supposition that a religion may
   exist which can give us a better knowledge of God than is to be found
   in the vague and uncertain conjectures and fancies of minds left to
   their own groping after the Divine. If such a religion exists,
   furnishing clear and satisfying knowledge of God, His character, will,
   and ways, His relations to men, and the purposes of His grace, there is
   plainly great room and need in the world for it; and the consideration
   of its claims cannot be barred by the assumption that the only valuable
   elements in any religion must be those which it has in common with all
   religions--which is the very point in dispute. The only question that
   can be properly raised is, Whether Christianity is a religion of this
   nature? And this can only be ascertained by actual inspection.

   Turning next to those within the Christian pale who would rule the
   doctrinal element out of their religion, I confess I find it difficult
   to understand on what grounds they can justify their procedure. If
   there is a religion in the world which exalts the office of teaching,
   it is safe to say that it is the religion of Jesus Christ. It has been
   frequently remarked that in pagan religions the doctrinal element is at
   a minimum--the chief thing there is the performance of a ritual. [33]
   But this is precisely where Christianity distinguishes itself from
   other religions--it does contain doctrine. It comes to men with
   definite, positive teaching; it claims to be the truth; it bases
   religion on knowledge, though a knowledge which is only attainable
   under moral conditions. I do not see how any one can deal fairly with
   the facts as they lie before us in the Gospels and Epistles, without
   coming to the conclusion that the New Testament is full of doctrine.
   The recently founded science of "New Testament Theology," which has
   already attained to a position of such commanding importance among the
   theological disciplines, is an unexceptionable witness to the same
   fact. And this is as it should be. A religion based on mere feeling is
   the vaguest most unreliable, most unstable of all things. A strong,
   stable, religious life can be built up on no other ground than that of
   intelligent conviction. Christianity, therefore, addresses itself to
   the intelligence as well as to the heart. It sounds plausible indeed to
   say, Let us avoid all doctrinal subtleties; let as keep to a few plain,
   easy, simple pro positions, in regard to which there will be general
   agreement. But, unfortunately, men will think on those deep problems
   which lie at the root of religious belief--on the nature of God, His
   character, His relations to the world and men, sin, the means of
   deliverance from it, the end to which things are moving, and if
   Christianity does not give them an answer, suited to their deeper and
   more reflective moods, they will simply put it aside as in adequate for
   their needs. Everything depends here on what the Revelation of the
   Bible is supposed to be. If it is a few general elementary truths of
   religion we are in search of, it may freely be conceded that these
   might have been given in very simple form. But if we are to have a
   Revelation such as the Bible professes to convey, a Revelation high as
   the nature of God, deep as the nature of man, universal as the wants of
   the race, which is to accompany man through all the ascending stages of
   hi development and still be felt to be a power and inspiration to him
   for further progress,--it is absurd to expect that such a Revelation
   will not have many profound and difficult, things in it, and that it
   will not afford food for thought in its grandest and highest reaches
   "Thy judgments are a great deep." [34] A religion divorced from earnest
   and lofty thought has always, down the whole history of the Church,
   tended to become weak, jejune, and unwholesome; while the intellect,
   deprived of its rights within religion, has sought its satisfaction
   without, and developed into godless nationalism.

   Christianity, it is sometimes, said by those who represent this view,
   is a life, not a creed; it is a spiritual system, and has nothing to do
   with dogmatic affirmations. But this is to confuse two things
   essentially different--Christianity as an inward principle of conduct,
   a subjective religious experience, on the one hand, and Christianity as
   an objective fact, or an historic magnitude, on the other. But can even
   the life be produced, or can it be sustained and nourished, without
   knowledge? Here I cannot forbear the remark that it is a strange idea
   of many who urge this objection in the interests of what they conceive
   to be a more spiritual form of Christianity, that "spirituality" in a
   religion is somehow synonymous with vagueness and indefiniteness; that
   the more perfectly they can vaporise or volatilise Christianity into a
   nebulous haze, in which nothing can be perceived distinctly, the nearer
   they bring it to the ideal of a spiritual religion. [35] This, it is
   safe to say, was not Paul's idea of spirituality--he by whom the
   distinction of "letter" and "spirit" was most strongly emphasised. The
   region of the spiritual was rather with him, as it is throughout
   Scripture, the region of the clearest insight and most accurate
   perception--of full and perfect knowledge (epignosis). His unceasing
   prayer for his converts was, not that their minds might remain in a
   state of hazy indistinctness, but that God would give them "a spirit of
   wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, having the eyes of
   (their) heart enlightened," that they might grow up in this knowledge,
   till they should "all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the
   knowledge of the Son of God, unto a full-grown man, unto the measure of
   the stature of the fulness of Christ." [36]

   An objection to the recognition of doctrine in Christianity may be
   raised, however, from the side of Christian positivism, as well as from
   that of Christian mysticism. Christianity, it will be here said, is a
   fact-revelation--it has its centre in a living in Christ, and not a
   dogmatic creed. And this in a sense is true. The title of my Lectures
   is the acknowledgment of it. The facts of Revelation are before the
   doctrines built on them. The gospel is no mere proclamation of "eternal
   truths," but the discovery of a saving purpose of God for mankind,
   executed in time. But the doctrines are the interpretation of the
   facts. The facts do not stand blank and dumb before us, but have a
   voice given to them, and a meaning put into them. They are accompanied
   by living speech, which makes their meaning clear. When John declares
   that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, and is the Son of God, [37] he
   is stating a fact, but he is none the less enunciating a doctrine. When
   Paul affirms, "Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,"
   [38] he is proclaiming a fact, but he is at the same time giving an
   interpretation of it. No writer has laid more stress on the fact, and
   less on the doctrine, in primitive Christianity than Professor Harnack,
   yet he cannot help saying, "So far as the God and Father of Jesus
   Christ is believed in as the Almighty Lord of heaven and earth, the
   Christian religion includes a definite knowledge of God, of the world,
   and of the world-aim." [39] This concedes in principle all that I
   maintain. It affirms that the facts of Christianity, rightly understood
   and interpreted, not only yield special doctrines, but compel us to
   develop out of them a determinate "Weltanschauung." This is precisely
   the assertion of the present Lectures.

   If I refer for a moment in this connection to Schleiermacher, who may
   be named as the most distinguished representative of the theology of
   feeling it is because I think that the position of this remarkable man
   on the question before us is frequently misunderstood. Schleiermacher's
   earlier views are not unlike some of those we have already been
   considering, and are entangled in many difficulties and inconsistencies
   in consequence. I deal here only with his later and more matured
   thought, as represented in his work, Der christliche Glaube. In it also
   piety is still defined as feeling. It is, he says neither a mode of
   knowing nor a mode of action, but a mode of feeling, or of immediate
   selfconsciousness. It is the consciousness of ourselves as absolutely
   dependent, or, what comes to the same thing, as standing in relation
   with God. [40] In his earlier writings he had defined it more generally
   as the immediate feeling of the infinite and eternal, the immediate
   consciousness of the being of all that is finite in the infinite, of
   all that is temporal in the eternal, awakened by the contemplation of
   the universe. [41] But along with this must be taken into account
   Schleiermacher's view of the nature of feeling. According to him,
   feeling is the opposite of knowledge than that pure, original state of
   consciousness--prior to both knowledge and action--out of which
   knowledge and action may subsequently be developed. [42] In
   Christianity this law material of the religious consciousness receives,
   as it were, a definite shaping and content. The peculiarity in the
   Christian consciousness is that everything in it is referred back upon
   Jesus Christ, and the Redemption accomplished through Him. [43] This
   moving back from the religious consciousness to the Person of the
   sinless Redeemer as the historical cause of it is already a
   transcending of the bounds of a theology of mere feeling. Theology is
   no longer merely a description of states of consciousness, when it
   leads us out for an explanation of these states into the region of
   historic fact. But an equally important circumstance is that, while
   describing the Christian consciousness mainly in terms of feeling,
   Schleiermacher does not deny that a dogmatic is implicitly contained in
   this consciousness, and is capable of development out of it. His Der
   christliche Glaube is, on the contrary, the unfolding of such a
   dogmatic. His position, therefore, is not offhand to be identified with
   that of the advocates of a perfectly undogmatic Christianity. These
   would rule the doctrinal element out of Christianity altogether. But
   Schleiermacher, while he lays the main stress in the production of this
   consciousness of Redemption in the believer on the Person of the
   Redeemer, and only subordinately on his teaching, yet recognises in
   Christian piety a positive, given content, and out of this he evolves a
   clearly defined and scientifically arranged system of doctrines. It is
   to be regretted that in the foundation of his theology--the doctrine of
   God--Schleiermacher never broke with his initial assumption that God
   cannot be known as He really is, but only as reflected in states of
   human consciousness, and therefore failed to lift his theology as a
   whole out of the region of subjectivity.

   A chief reason probably why many entertain a prejudice against the
   admission of a definite doctrinal content in Christianity, is that they
   think it militates against the idea of "progress" in theology. How does
   the matter stand in this respect? Growth and advance of some kind, of
   course, there is and must be in theology. It cannot be that the other
   departments of knowledge unceasingly progress, and theology stands
   still. No one familiar with the history of theology will deny that
   great changes have taken place in the shape which doctrines have
   assumed in the course of their development, or will question that these
   changes have been determined largely by the ruling ideas, the habits of
   thought, the state of knowledge and culture, of each particular time.
   The dogmatic moulds which were found adequate for one age have often
   proved insufficient for the next, to which a larger horizon of vision
   has been granted; and have had to be broken up that new ones might be
   created, more adapted to the content of a Revelation which in some
   sense transcends them all. I recognise therefore to the full the need
   of growth and progress in theology. [44] Bit by bit, as the ages go on,
   we see more clearly the essential lineaments of the truth as it is in
   Jesus; we learn to disengage the genuine truths of Christ's gospel from
   human additions and corruptions; we apprehend their bearings and
   relations with one another, and with new truths, more distinctly; we
   see them in new points of view, develop and apply them in new ways. All
   this is true, and it is needful to remember it lest to temporary points
   of view, and human theories and formulations we attribute an authority
   and completeness which in no way belong to them. But it does not by any
   means follow from this that therefore, everything in Christianity is
   fluent, that it has no fixed startingpoints, no definite basal lines,
   no sure and moveless foundations, no grand determinative positions
   which control and govern all thought within distinctly Christian
   limits,--still less that, in the course of its long history, theology
   has achieved nothing, or has reached no results which can fairly be
   regarded as settled. This is the exaggeration on the other side, and so
   far from being helpful to progress in theology, it is in reality the
   denial of its possibility. Progress in theology implies that there is
   something to develop--that some truths at all events, relating to God
   and to Divine things, are ascertainable, and are capable of scientific
   treatment. It is easy to speak of the attempt to "limit infinite truth
   within definite formulÃ¦"; but, on the other hand, unless some portion
   at least of this infinite, truth can be brought within range of the
   human faculties, theology has nothing to work on. It is a
   pseudo-science, and to speak of progress in it is idle.

   II. From the Ritschlian distinction of a "religious" and a "theoretic"
   view of the world.

   II. The recent tendency in Continental theology, however, is not so
   much to deny the existence of a definite "Weltanschauung" in the Bible,
   as rather to lay stress on the distinction between a "religious" and a
   "theoretic" view of the world--ascribing to Christianity the former,
   but not the latter. This is the position of the school of Ritschl, and
   truth and error are so intimately blended in it that it is necessary to
   give it our careful consideration. [45] That a sound distinction
   underlies the terms "religious" and "theoretic" is not to be disputed,
   and it is important that its nature should be rightly understood. But,
   under the plea of expelling metaphysics from theology, the tendency is
   at present to revive this distinction in a form which practically
   amounts to the resuscitation of the old doctrine of a "double
   truth"--the one religious, the other philosophical; and it is not held
   necessary that even where the two overlap they should always be found
   in agreement. It is not simply that the two kinds of knowledge have
   different spheres, move in different orbits, and have to do with a
   different class of objects; for this Ritschl at least denies. [46] But
   they set out from different starting-points, judge by different
   standards, and as a consequence frequently lead to different results.
   Religious knowledge, Ritschl holds, moves only in the sphere of what he
   calls worth- or value-judgments. That is to say, it judges of things,
   not according to their objective nature and relations, but according to
   their value for us--according to their fitness to meet and satisfy
   religious necessities. [47] This, logically, would lead to pure
   subjectivism, and in the hands of some of Ritschl's followers actually
   does so. [48] This tendency is strengthened by the theory of knowledge
   to which this school generally has committed itself--a theory Kantian
   in its origin--which, denying to the mind any power of knowing things
   as they are, limits it within the sphere of phenomenal representations.
   Ritschl himself tries hard to ward off this reproach of subjectivity
   from his system, and makes more than one attempt to find a bridge from
   the practical to the theoretic, but with no real success. He never
   quits the ground that it is not the objective truth of things--which
   would carry us into the region of theoretic knowledge--which forms the
   subject--matter of our inquiry in theology, but solely their subjective
   aspect as related to our own states of pleasure and pain, or as helping
   or hindering the ends sought in religion. In his doctrines of God and
   Christ, of Providence and miracle, of sin and Redemption as we shall
   afterwards see, it is constantly this subjective aspect of things,
   which may be very different from our actual or scientific judgment upon
   them, which is brought into prominence. Religion requires, for example,
   that we view the universe from a teleological and not from a causal
   standpoint, and therefore that we postulate God and Providence. But
   these are only practical, not theoretic notions, and the mechanical and
   causal view of the universe may stand alongside of them intact.
   "Miracle" is the religious name for an event which awakens in us a
   powerful impression of the help of God, but is not to be held as
   interfering with the scientific doctrine of the unbroken connection of
   nature. [49] Not only are the two spheres of knowledge to be thus kept
   apart in our minds, but we are not to be allowed to trace any lines of
   relation between them. We are not to be allowed, e.g., to seek any
   theoretic proof of the existence of God; or to ask how special
   Providence, or the efficacy of prayer, or supernatural Revelation, or
   miracle, or even our own freedom is to be reconciled with the reign of
   unbroken natural causation. All such inquiries are tabooed as a mixing
   up of distinct sphere of knowledge, with the result, however, that they
   are not really kept apart, but that all in the ideas of Providence,
   miracle, prayer, etc. which conflicts with the theoretic view is
   explained away

   It should scarcely require much argument to convince us that this
   proposal to divide the house of the mind into two compartments, each of
   which is to be kept sacredly apart from the other, is a perfectly
   illusory and untenable one. It might have some meaning in an Ã¦sthetic
   theory of religion, in which the religious conceptions are avowedly
   treated as pure ideals, but it can have none where the speech is of
   religious "knowledge." There are, indeed, different modes of cognising
   the same object, as well as different stages and degrees of real
   knowledge. If by "theoretic knowledge" is meant only knowledge gained
   by the methods of exact science, or by philosophical reflection, [50]
   then, apart from religion altogether, there are vast fields of our
   knowledge which will not come under this category. The knowledge, for
   example, which we have of one another in the common intercourse of
   life, or the knowledge which the ordinary man gathers from his
   experience of the outward world, is very different in purity of
   theoretical character from the kind of knowledge aimed at by the
   psychologist or metaphysician, or by the student of science in his
   investigations of nature. It is as far removed as possible from the
   disinterested character which Ritschl ascribes to the knowledge he
   calls "theoretical." Yet there is no part of this knowledge in which
   theoretic activities are not present. The same processes of thought
   which are employed in philosophy and science are implied in the
   simplest act of the understanding. In like manner, we may grant that
   there is a distinction of character and form--not to speak of
   origin--between religious and what may be called theoretic knowledge;
   and that thus far the distinction insisted on by Ritschl and his school
   has a certain relative justification. Religion, assuredly, is not a
   theoretical product. It did not originate in reasoning, but in an
   immediate perception or experience of the Divine in some of the spheres
   of its natural or supernatural manifestation; for the reception of
   which again a native capacity or endowment must be presupposed in the
   human spirit. Even Revelation implies the possession of this capacity
   in man to cognise the manifestations of the Divine when they are set
   before him. Originating in this way, religious knowledge--at least in
   its first or immediate form--is distinguished by certain peculiarities.
   For one thing, it is distinguished from strictly theoretic knowledge by
   the practical motive which obtains in it. Theoretic knowledge aims at a
   representation of objects in their purely objective character and
   relations. Religion, on the other hand, seeks to set its objects before
   it in those lights, and under those aspects, which directly subserve
   religious ends. With this difference of aim is connected a difference
   of form. Theoretic knowledge is cool, clear, and scientifically exact.
   Religious knowledge is touched with emotion, and moves largely in the
   region of figurative conception, or what the Germans would call
   "Vorstellung." In the first place, religion, as having to do with the
   personal relation of the soul to God, moves in a sphere in which the
   affections and emotions are necessarily allowed large play. Its modes
   of apprehension are therefore warm, lively, impassioned, intuitive. It
   groups its material under the influence of the dominant feeling; lays
   hold of those sides and relations of the object which affect itself,
   and lets the others drop out of view; leaps over intermediate links of
   causation, and seeks to grasp the object at once in its essential
   reality and inner significance--in its relation to its ultimate cause
   and final end. A second cause which leads to the same result is that
   the objects with which religion has to deal are largely
   transcendental--that is, they lie beyond the range and conditions of
   our present experience. A certain amount of figurative representation
   necessarily enters into the purest conceptions we are able to form of
   such objects.

   To the extent now indicated we may agree with Ritschl that religion
   moves--if he chooses to phrase it so--in the sphere of value-judgments,
   and not in that of scientific apprehension. But this is not to be
   interpreted as if religion did not affirm the objective truth of the
   ideas it entertains--as if its judgments of value were not at the same
   time judgments of truth. Still less is it to be conceded that there is
   any necessary divorce between the mind in its practical and the mind in
   its theoretical activities, so that propositions may be affirmed in the
   one sphere which have no relation to, can receive no corroboration
   from, may even be contradicted by, propositions affirmed in the other.
   Thus to tear asunder faith and reason is to render no service to
   religion, but is to pave the way for theoretical scepticism. It is in
   truth the same reason which works in both spheres; the results,
   therefore, must be such as is admit of comparison. If Ritschl would
   raise a bar against any such comparison of the results of religious
   thinking with the conclusions reached by philosophy and
   science--leaving each to work in its own domain--a more just view of
   the subject will recognise that this is impossible. We cannot have two
   spheres of truth lying side by side in the same mind without some
   effort to arrive at an adjustment between them. Still less is it
   possible for the mind to find itself in conflict with itself,--on the
   one side for instance, affirming the personality of God, on the other
   denying it; on the one side affirming freedom, Revelation, miracle, on
   the other unbroken natural causation,--and not do what it can to annul
   the discrepancy. Nor will reason in practice be content to remain in
   this state of division with itself. It will insist on its knowledge
   being brought to some sort of unity, or, if this cannot be done, in
   regarding one or other of the conflicting propositions as illusive.

   Finally, it is not sufficiently recognised by Ritschl and his school
   that religion itself, while in the first instance practical, carries in
   it also the impulse to raise its knowledge to theoretic form. Faith
   cannot but seek to advance to knowledge--that is, to the reflective and
   scientific comprehension of its own contents. Just because its
   propositions are held to be not only "judgments of value," but to
   contain objective truth, they must be capable of being submitted to
   theoretic treatment. Ritschl himself recognises the necessity of
   constructing a theology which shall be adequate to the contents of the
   Christian Revelation. Only he would have it move solely within the
   region of faith-propositions, or, as he calls them, "judgments of
   value." Its task is ended when it has faithfully collected, purely
   expressed, and internally co-ordinated these religious affirmations.
   [51] It is not observed how much theoretic and critical activity is
   already implied in this very process of collating, sifting, and
   co-ordinating; or how largely, in Ritschl's own case, the results are
   dependent on the theoretic presuppositions with which he sets out in
   his (metaphysical) doctrine of knowledge, and his general theory of
   religion. But, waiving this, it is surely vain to ask theology to go so
   far, and then say it is to go no further. Christian science has many
   tasks beyond those which the Ritschlian limitation would prescribe for
   it. How, for example, can it refuse the task of investigating its own
   grounds of certainty? How can it help raising the question of how far
   these religious conceptions, now brought to expression and
   co-ordinated, answer to objective truth? How can it avoid asking if
   this content of the Christian Revelation receives no verification from
   the laws of man's spiritual life, or in what this verification
   consists? Can it help going back on its own presuppositions, and asking
   what these are, and what kind of view of God and man they imply? How
   can it help connecting this truth given in Revelation with truth in
   other departments? And this investigation is not a mere matter of
   choice in theology; it is forced on it as a necessity. For in the very
   process of collation and criticism questions arise which can only be
   solved by going further down. Antinomies arise within theology itself:
   the different sides of Biblical truth have to be harmonised in a wider
   conception; unity of view has to be sought in a field where only parts
   are given, and much is left to be inferred. All this involves a large
   amount of theoretic treatment in theology, and may--I should rather say
   must--result in showing that the truths of Revelation have also a
   theoretic idea, and are capable of theoretic verification and
   corroboration.

   I conclude, therefore, that it is legitimate to speak of a Christian
   "Weltanschauung," and that we are not debarred from investigating its
   relations to theoretic knowledge.

                             APPENDIX TO LECTURE I.

                         SKETCH OF THE CHRISTIAN VIEW.

   It may conduce to clearness if, having indicated the general scope and
   purport of these Lectures, I now give in this Appendix a brief
   statement, in propositional form, of what I consider the Christian view
   of the world to be, and sketch on the basis of this the course to be
   pursued in the succeeding Lectures.

   I. First, then, the Christian view affirms the existence of a Personal,
   Ethical, Self-Revealing God. It is thus at the out set a system of
   Theism, and as such is opposed to all systems of Atheism, Agnosticism,
   Pantheism, or mere Deism.

   II. The Christian view affirms the creation of the world by God, His
   immanent presence in it, His transcendence over it, and His holy and
   wise government of it for moral ends.

   III. The Christian view affirms the spiritual nature and dignity of
   man--his creation in the Divine image, and destination to bear the
   likeness of God in a perfected relation of sonship.

   IV. The Christian view affirms the fact of the sin and disorder of the
   world, not as something belonging to the Divine idea of it, and
   inhering in it by necessity, but as something which has entered it by
   the voluntary turning aside of man from his allegiance to his Creator,
   and from the path of his normal development. The Christian view of the
   world, in other words, involves a Fall as the presupposition of its
   doctrine of Redemption; whereas the "modern" view of the world affirms
   that the so-called Fall was in reality a rise, and denies by
   consequence the need of Redemption in the scriptural sense.

   V. The Christian view affirms the historical Self-Revelation of God to
   the patriarchs and in the line of Israel, and, as brought to light by
   this, a gracious purpose of God for the salvation of the world,
   centring in Jesus Christ, His Son, and the new Head of humanity.

   VI. The Christian view affirms that Jesus Christ was not mere man, but
   the eternal Son of God--a truly Divine Person--who in the fulness of
   time took upon Him our humanity, and who, on the ground that in Him as
   man there dwells the fulness of the Godhead bodily, is to be honoured,
   worshipped, and trusted, even as God is. This is the transcendent
   "mystery of godliness" [52] --the central and amazing assertion of the
   Christian view--by reference to which our relation is determined to
   every thing else which it contains.

   Pausing for a moment on this truth of the Incarnation, we have to
   notice its central place in the Christian system, and through its light
   every other doctrine is illuminated and transformed.

   1. The Incarnation sheds new light on the nature of God, and, in
   conjunction with the work of the Spirit, reveals Him as triune
   --Father, Son, and Spirit--one God.

   2. The Incarnation sheds new light on the doctrine of creation--all
   things being now seen to be created by Christ as well as for Him.

   3. The Incarnation sheds new light on the nature of man, alike as
   respects its capacity for union with the Divine, its possibilities of
   perfection, and the high destinies awaiting it in the future.

   4. The Incarnation sheds new light on the purpose of God in the
   creation and Redemption of men--that end being, in the words of Paul,
   "in the dispensation of the fulness of times to gather together in one
   all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth,
   even in Him." [53]

   5 The Incarnation sheds new light on the permission of sin by showing
   the possibility of Redemption from it, and how, through the Revelation
   of the Divine purposes of mercy, a far grander discovery is made of the
   Divine character, and far higher prospects are opened up for humanity.

   VII. The Christian view affirms the Redemption of the world through a
   great act of Atonement--this Atonement to be appropriated by faith, and
   availing for all who do not wilfully withstand and reject its grace.

   VIII. The Christian view affirms that the historical aim of Christ's
   work was the founding of a Kingdom of God on earth, which includes not
   only the spiritual salvation of individuals, but a new order of
   society, the result of the action of the spiritual forces set in motion
   through Christ.

   IX. Finally, the Christian view affirms that history has a goal, and
   that the present order of things will be terminated by the appearance
   of the Son of Man for judgment, the resurrection of the dead, and the
   final separation of righteous and wicked,--final, so far as the
   Scriptures afford any light, or entitle us to hold out any hope.

   Beyond this are the eternal ages, on whose depths only stray lights
   fall, as in that remarkable passage--"Then cometh the end, when He
   shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father: . . . then
   shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things
   under Him, that God may be all in all" [54] --and on the mysterious
   blessedness or sorrow of which, as the case may be, it is needless to
   speculate.

   I have for clearness' sake exhibited this outline of the Christian view
   in a series of propositions, but I need hardly say that it is not my
   intention to attempt to exhaust this out line, or anything like it, in
   this brief course of Lectures. In the actual treatment of my subject I
   shall be guided very much by the way in which the main positions of the
   Christian view are related to current theories and negations.

   1. It is plain that the Christian view of the world is Theistic, and as
   such is opposed, as already said, to all the views which deny a living
   personal God, and also to Deism, which denies Revelation.

   2. The Christian views of nature and man come into conflict with many
   current theories. They involve, for example, the ideas of creation, and
   of the spirituality, freedom, and immortal destiny of man--all of which
   the thoroughgoing "modern" view of the world opposes.

   3. The Christian view of sin is irreconcilable with modern theories,
   which represent sin as a necessity of development, and nullify its true
   conception by starting man off at a stage but little removed from that
   of the brutes. At least I take this to be the case, and shall endeavour
   to give reasons for my opinion.

   The above denials, if logically carried out, involve the rejection of
   the Christian view as a whole. We reject the Christian view in toto if
   we deny the existence of God, the spiritual nature and immortality of
   man, or destroy the idea of sin. In what follows we are rather in the
   region of Christian heresy; at least the total rejection of the
   Christian view is not necessarily implied, though in its mutilation it
   is found that neither can that which is preserved be permanently
   maintained.

   4. The assertion of the Incarnation may be met by a lower estimate of
   Christ's Person than the full Christian doctrine implies; or by the
   complete denial of the supernatural dignity of His Person.

   5. The Christian view may be met by the denial of the need or the
   reality of Atonement, or by inadequate or unscriptural representations
   of that great doctrine.

   6. There may be unscriptural denials, as well as unwarrantable
   dogmatisms, in the matter of eschatology.

   My course, then, in view of the various antitheses, will shape itself
   as follows:--

   First, keeping in mind that it is the Incarnation which is the central
   point in the Christian view, I shall look in the second Lecture at the
   alternatives which are historically presented to us if this doctrine is
   rejected.

   Next, in the third, fourth, and fifth Lectures, I shall consider in
   order the three postulates of the Christian view--God, Nature and Man,
   and Sin.

   The sixth Lecture will be devoted to the Incarnation itself, and the
   seventh to the consideration of some related topics--the higher
   Christian concept of God, and the relation of the Incarnation to the
   plan of the world.

   The eighth Lecture will treat of the Incarnation and Redemption from
   sin; and the concluding Lecture will treat of the Incarnation and human
   destiny. [55]

LECTURE II.

  THE CHISTIAN VIEW AND ITS ALERNATIVES

    Introductory

   It is the fundamental assumption of these Lectures that the central
   point in the Christian view of God and the world is the acknowledgment
   of Jesus Christ as a truly Divine Person--the Son of God made flesh.
   How is this assumption to be vindicated? I do not conceal from myself
   that the issues involved in such an assertion are very stupendous. The
   belief in Jesus as the Son of God is not one to be lightly taken up,
   but when it is taken up, it practically determines, as has already been
   said, a man's views on everything else in Christianity. No one will
   dispute that, if Jesus Christ is what the creeds declare Him to be--an
   Incarnation of the Divine--His Person is necessarily central in His own
   religion, nay, in the universe. Christianity, on this assumption, is
   correctly described as the religion of the Incarnation.

   On the other hand, this is precisely the view of the Person of Christ
   which, we are told, the modern view of the world compels us to reject.
   No doctrine stumbles the modern mind so completely as this. It is
   flatly pronounced incredible and absurd. That Jesus was the holiest of
   men--the Divinest of the race, the most perfect exhibition of the
   god-like in humanity--may well be conceded; but of literal Incarnation
   it is not permitted to the modern intelligence to speak. Science has to
   investigate the origin of the dogma; to show how it arose from the
   powerful impression made by Jesus on His followers; how it was shaped
   by Hebrew and Hellenic modes of thought; but it cannot for a moment
   entertain the possibility that the idea which it represents is true. As
   strenuously is our right resisted to speak of this doctrine as an
   essential and integral part of Christianity. Short of this conception,
   it is said, there are many grades of belief in

   Christ, and we are not entitled to unchristianise any of them To
   identify the essence of Christianity with the Incarnation is, it is
   held, to make a particular dogmatic interpretation of Christianity
   equivalent to Christianity itself. It is not, indeed, among the
   extremer sceptics that we find any difficulty in getting the
   acknowledgment that the Incarnation is central in Christianity. "It
   is," says Strauss, "certainly the central dogma in Christianity. Here
   the Founder is at the same time the most prominent object of worship;
   the system based on Him loses its support as soon as He is shown to be
   lacking in the qualities appropriate to an object of religious
   worship." [56] "In Him alone," says Feuerbach, "is concentrated the
   Christian religion." [57] Quite logically, from his point of view,
   Strauss draws the conclusion that, since the Incarnation is untenable,
   Christianity falls to the ground with it. But others will not go thus
   far. They distinguish between Christianity and its accidents, and put
   this doctrine in the category of the accidents. Nay, it is ostensibly
   in the interests of what is supposed to be a purer and more primitive
   form of Christianity that in many quarters the demand for the surrender
   of this doctrine is made. The cry is, " Back from Christianity to
   Christ"--back from the Christianity of the creeds, from the
   Christianity even of Paul and John--to the Christ of the simple
   Galilean gospel, who never dreamt of making himself God. As Lessing, in
   a famous passage, distinguishes between " the religion of Christ" and
   "the Christian religion," meaning by the former the religion which
   Christ Himself professed and practised, and by the latter the
   superstructure of dogma subsequently reared on this, [58] so an
   analogous distinction is drawn between the Pauline and Johannine
   Christ, with His halo of supernatural attributes, and the meek and
   lowly Jesus, so intensely human, of the Synoptic Gospels.

   Nevertheless, the ablest theology of the century will sustain me in the
   general assertion, that the central principle of Christianity is the
   Person of its Founder. Whatever may be thought of the great speculative
   movement in the beginning of the century, connected with the names of
   Fichte and Schelling and Hegel, it cannot be denied that at least it
   rendered an essential service to theology in overcoming the shallow
   rationalism of the preceding period, and in restoring to its place of
   honour in the Christian system the doctrine of Christ's Person, which
   it had become customary to put in the background. Still more
   influential in this direction was the powerful impulse given to
   theology by Schleiermacher. Since that time all the best theology in
   Germany may be said to be Christological. That Christ sustains a
   different relation to His religion from that of ordinary founders of
   religion to the faiths they have founded; that in Him there was a
   peculiar union of the Divine and human; that His appearance and work
   were of decisive importance for the Church and for humanity--these are
   thoughts which may be said to be common to all the greater systems,
   irrespective of schools. They are found among theologians as widely
   separated in dogmatic standpoint tendency as Rothe and Dorner,
   Biedermann and Lipsius, Beyschlag and Ritschl, Luthardt and Frank. It
   is only outside the circles of really influential theology that we find
   a reversion to the loose deistic conception of Christ as simply a
   Prophet or moral Teacher, like Moses or Confucius or Buddha. [59] It is
   indeed a powerful proof of the view that the Person of Christ is of
   unique importance in His religion, that whenever a new breath of life
   passes over theology, and an attempt is made to gain a profounder
   apprehension of Christianity, there is a recurrence to this idea, and
   the necessity is felt of doing justice to it; thus testifying to the
   truth of Dorner's remark, "A Christian system which is unable to make
   Christology an integral part of itself, has pronounced its own
   judgment; it has really given up the claim to the title of Christian."
   [60]

   At the same time, this acknowledgment of the central and unique place
   of time Founder of Christianity in His religion does not settle the
   question of the precise estimate we are to take of His Person. Is He
   merely human, or is He Divine as well? Or if Divine, in what sense do
   we attach this predicate to Him? Is it, as with the Hegelians, the mere
   expression of a metaphysical idea--of that identity of the Divine and
   the human which is as true of all men as it is of Christ, only that it
   came first to clear consciousness in Him? Or is it, as with Ritschl,
   the mere expression of a value judgment of the believer--a predicate
   denoting the worth which Christ has for the believing soul as the
   supreme Revealer of God's character and purpose? Or is it, as with
   others, an ethical Divinity that is ascribed to Christ--such
   participation in the Divine nature and life of Sonship as may be
   experienced also by the believer? [61] Or shall we hold, in agreement
   with the general faith of the Church, that Christ is more than all
   this--that in Him the Divine pre-existing Word truly and personally
   became incarnate, and made our nature His own--that therefore He is the
   Son of God, not simply as we are, but in a high and transcendental
   sense, in which we cannot compare ourselves with Him? This question, in
   the present state of controversy, is not so easily settled as might at
   first sight appear. It is vain, of course, to appeal to the great
   ecclesiastical creeds, for it is they which are in dispute. It is vain
   also, at this stage, to attempt to settle the question by the simple
   method of citation of proof texts. The facts of Christ's
   self-revelation, and His witness to His own Person, must indeed, in the
   last resort, be the ground on which our faith in Him rests, and it will
   be necessary at a later stage to examine this self-witness of Christ,
   as well as the apostolic doctrine, with considerable care. [62] But at
   the outset this method is attended by obvious disadvantages. It is easy
   to say--the original documents of Christianity are before us; let us
   examine them. But, for one thing, some of these documents--the Fourth
   Gospel, e.g., and some of the Pauline epistles--are themselves in
   dispute among our opponents; and, even if genuine, their authority is
   not accepted as decisive. In the next place, there is the question,
   whether there are not traces of development in the doctrine of the
   Person of Christ even within the New Testament--whether all the sacred
   writers teach the same view. There are many, as I have already said,
   who will admit that Christ's Divinity is taught by Paul and John, who
   would deny that it is taught by Christ Himself. These are difficulties
   which cannot be satisfactorily met by mere assertion, and the question
   recurs, whether--as a provisional expedient at least--any other course
   is open to us?

   There is another method which I propose to apply in this Lecture, one
   which appears to me to have the advantage of dealing with all these
   issues at once, and at the same time deals with issues of a wider
   character. It is the method of appeal to history. The individual
   judgment may err in the opinions it forms, and in the conclusions it
   deduces from them. It is not given to any man to see all the
   consequences that follow from his own thinking. He may quite
   conceivably hold in the scheme of his beliefs propositions that are
   inconsistent with each other, and, if logically carried out, would
   destroy each other, and not be aware of the fact. In history things get
   beaten out to their true issues. The strands of thought that are
   incompatible with each other get separated; conflicting tendencies, at
   first unperceived, are brought to light; opposite one-sidednesses
   correct each other; and the true consequences of theories reveal
   themselves with inexorable necessity. As Socrates, in Plato's Republic,
   [63] investigating the nature of Justice, proposes to study it first as
   "writ large" in the collective magnitude of the State, that thereafter
   he may return with better knowledge to the study of it in the
   individual, so the movements of thought are best studied on the broad
   scale in which they present themselves over large periods of time. It
   is to this test I propose to bring the great question of
   Christianity--the same that was proposed by Jesus to the Pharisees
   eighteen hundred years ago--"What think ye of Christ? Whose Son is He?"
   [64] I shall ask what aid history affords us in determining the true
   estimate to be put upon the Person of Christ, and the place held in the
   Christian system by the doctrine of the Incarnation.

   It is one advantage of this method, that, as I have said, it brings all
   the issues into court at once. The verdict of history is at once a
   judgment on the answers which have been given to the theological
   question; on their agreement with the sum-total of the facts of
   Christianity; on the methods of exegesis and New Testament criticism by
   which they have been supported; on their power to maintain themselves
   against rival views; on how far the existence of Christianity is
   dependent on them, or bound up with them.

    I. History a series of alternatives--the downward movement.

   I. History, then, as it seems to me, presents us with a series of
   alternatives of a deeply interesting character, by studying which we
   may find our bearings on this question, "What think ye of Christ?" as
   we can in no other way.

   1. First alternative--A Divine Christ or humanitarianism.

   1. The first essential service which history has rendered us has been
   in the elimination of intermediate views--in making it clear as a first
   alternative that the real issue on this question is between a truly
   Divine Christ and pure humanitarianism. Intermediate views on Christ's
   Person have from time to time arisen, and still go on arising, in the
   Church; but, like the intermediate species of plants and animals Mr.
   Darwin tells us of, which are invariably driven to the wall in the
   struggle for existence, they have never been able to survive. There is,
   e.g., the Arian view, which has appeared again and again in the history
   of the Church in times of spiritual decadence. To find a place for the
   high attributes ascribed to Christ in Scripture, a lofty supernatural
   dignity is in this view assigned to Him. He was a sort of supreme
   angel, God's First-born, His instrument in the creation of the world,
   etc. But He was not eternal; He was not of Divine essence. It is safe
   to say that this view is now practically extinct. It would be a shallow
   reading of history to attribute the defeat of Arianism in the early
   Church to the anathemas of councils, the influence of court favour, or
   any other accidental circumstances. It perished through its own
   inherent weakness. [65] If the Arians admit all they profess to do
   about Christ--that He was pre-existent, God's agent in the creation of
   the world, etc.--there need be little difficulty in admitting the rest.
   On the other hand, if they stop short of the higher view to which the
   Scriptures seem to point, they entangle themselves in difficulties and
   contradictions, exegetical and other, which make it impossible for them
   to remain where they are. In reality, these high-sounding attributes
   which they ascribe to Christ are an excrescence on the system; for on
   this theory no work remains for Christ to do which could not have been
   accomplished equally well by a highly endowed man. Historically,
   therefore, Arianism has always tended to work round to the Socinian or
   strictly Unitarian view of Christ, where it has not gone upwards,
   through semi-Arianism, to the recognition of His full Divinity.

   But this Socinian or Unitarian view of the Person of Christ--I refer to
   the older Unitarianism of the Priestley and Channing type--is another
   of those intermediate views which history also may now be said to have
   eliminated. Christ, on this view, is the greatest of inspired teachers,
   a true Prophet. He had a divine mission; He wrought miracles in
   confirmation of His doctrine; He rose from the dead on the third day;
   He is expected to return to judge the world. Here also there is a great
   deal of the halo of the supernatural about Christ. He is supernatural
   in history, if not in nature, and men saw again that they must either
   believe more or believe less. The rationalistic leaven, which was
   already working in the rejection of the higher aspects of Christ's
   Person and work, made itself increasingly felt. As the miraculous
   adjuncts were retained only in deference to the representations of
   Scripture, they were readily abandoned when criticism professed to show
   how they might be stripped off without detriment to Christ's moral
   image. Be the cause what it may, it is undeniable that Unitarianism of
   this kind has not been able to maintain itself. It has constantly
   tended to purge itself of the remaining supernatural features in the
   portrait of Christ, and to descend to the level of simple
   humanitarianism, i.e., to the belief in Christ as simply a great man, a
   religious genius of the first rank, one in whom the light which shines
   in all men shone in an eminent degree--but still a mere man, without
   anything supernatural in His origin, nature, or history. [66]

   A further example of the difficulty of maintaining an intermediate
   position on the doctrine of the Person of Christ, may be taken from the
   long series of intermediate views which have sprung up on the soil of
   Germany as the result of the great intellectual and theological
   movement inaugurated by Hegel and Schleiermacher in the beginning of
   the century. Passing by the speculative Christologies--in which, when
   the veil was stripped off, it was found that the idea was every thing,
   the historical Christ nothing--I may refer here to the Christology of
   Schleiermacher and his school. Schleiermacher recognises to the full "a
   peculiar being of God in Christ." [67] He affirms Christ's perfect
   sinlessness, and the unique significance of His Personality for the
   Church and for the race. He is the Head, Archetype, Representative, and
   Redeemer of mankind. Only through Him is redemption from sin and
   fellowship of life with God possible. But when we come to inquire
   wherein consists this "peculiar being of God" in Christ, it proves,
   after all, to be only an exceptionally constant and energetic form of
   that God-consciousness which exists germinally in all men, and indeed
   lies at the root of religious experience generally. The difference
   between Christ and other men is thus in degree, not in kind. In Him
   this Divine element had the ascendency, in us it has not. He is a
   miracle, in so far as the Divine dwelt in Him in this unique and
   exceptional fulness and power, constituting Him the Redeemer and second
   Adam of the race; but there is no entrance of God into humanity such as
   we associate with the idea of Incarnation. When, further, we
   investigate the nature of Christ's saving activity, we find that the
   exalted, high-priestly functions which Schleiermacher ascribes to
   Christ shrink, on inspection, into very meagre dimensions. Christ's
   continued saving activity in His Church is presupposed, but it is not
   the activity of One who still lives and reigns on high, but rather the
   perpetuation of a posthumous influence, through the preservation of His
   image in the Gospels, and the fellowship of the Christian society. [68]
   Ultimately, therefore, Christ's saving activity is reduced to example
   and teaching; at most, to the spiritual influence of a great and unique
   historic Personality. [69] "When we have got this length, we are
   clearly back on the road to simple humanitarianism. Accordingly, none
   of Schleiermacher's followers have been able to stop exactly where he
   did. They have felt the inexorable compulsion of the less or more; and
   while some have gone back to rationalism, the great majority, as Rothe
   acknowledges, [70] have pressed on to more positive views, and have
   come into substantial harmony with confessional orthodoxy. A new wave
   of mediating theology has recently arisen in the school of Ritschl; but
   the fundamental principle of this school--the denial of the right of
   the theoretic reason to have anything to do with religion or
   theology--is not one that can permanently be approved of, and would, if
   followed out, end in boundless subjectivity. In this school also,
   accordingly, the necessity of less or more is asserting itself. Already
   the members of the school have begun to move off on different and
   irreconcilable lines--some in a more negative, the greater number in a
   more positive direction. The attempt of Ritschl to bar off all inquiry
   into the nature of Christ's Person, by resolving His "Godhead" into a
   mere value-judgment of the believer, is felt not to be satisfactory;
   and the admission is increasingly made that consistency of Christian
   thinking demands the acknowledgment of a transcendental basis. [71]

   The general verdict of history, therefore, is clearly against the
   permanence of these attempts at a middle view of Christ's Person, and
   warns us whither they tend. The liberal school in Germany, Holland, and
   France are clearly right in saying that the only alternative to
   Christ's true Divinity is pure humanitarianism; and that, if the former
   doctrine is rejected, the supernatural view of His Person must be
   altogether given up. This is a clear issue, and I think it is well to
   have matters brought to it without shrinking or disguise. I desire now
   to show that this first alternative soon hands us in a second.

   2. Second alternative--A Divine Christ or Agnosticism.

   2. The first alternative is between a Divine Christ and a purely human
   one--the second is between a Divine Christ and pure Agnosticism. Many
   of those who take the humanitarian view of Christ's Person are very far
   from wishing to deny that a great deal of what Christ taught was true.
   They do not wish to deny the existence of God, or the fact of a future
   life, or the essentials of Christian morality. In not a few cases they
   strongly uphold these truths--maintain them to be the true natural
   religion, in opposition to revealed. They account it Christ's greatest
   glory that He saw so clearly, and announced so unambiguously, the
   Fatherhood of God, the dignity of the soul, the certainty of
   immortality, and the dependence of happiness here and hereafter on
   virtue. It is a plausible view to take, for it seems to secure to those
   who hold it all that they take to be essential in Christianity, while
   at the same time it leaves them unbounded liberty to accept or reject
   what they like in modern "advanced" views--to get rid of miracles, go
   in with progressive theories of science, accept the newest criticism of
   the Gospels, etc. It is a plausible view, but it is an illusive one;
   for if there is one thing more than another which the logic of events
   makes evident, it is, that with the humanitarian view of Christ we
   cannot stop at simple, abstract Theism, but must go on to pure
   Agnosticism. This is indeed what the larger number of the more logical
   minds which leave rejected supernatural Christianity in our own day are
   doing. Nor is the process which heads to this result difficult to
   follow. The Deism of the last century rejected Christianity, and sought
   to establish in its place what it called "Natural Religion," i.e. a
   belief in God, in the future life, in a state of rewards and
   punishments, etc., based on reason alone. But however congruous with
   reason these doctrines may be in the place which they hold in the
   religion of Jesus, it was not really reason which had discovered them,
   or which gave assurance about them; nor did it follow that reason could
   successfully vindicate them, when torn from their context, and
   presented in the meagre, abstract form in which they appeared in the
   writings of the deists. What the deists did was to pick these doctrines
   out of the New Testament, separating them from the rest of the
   doctrines with which they were associated, and denuding them of
   everything which could make them real and vital to the minds and
   consciences of men; then to baptise this caput mortuum with the name of
   "Natural Religion." They were doctrines that had their roots in the
   Christian system, and the arguments from reason with which they were
   sup ported wore not the real grounds of belief in them. In the present
   century men are not so easily satisfied. [72] They see clearly enough
   that all the objections which have been levelled against the God of
   Revelation tell just as powerfully against the God of nature; that to
   admit Christ's doctrine of a Heavenly Father, of a soul made in God's
   image, of a special providence, of prayer, of forgiveness of sins, of a
   future life of happiness and misery, is already to have crossed the
   line which separates a merely natural from a supernatural view of
   things; and that to reject Christ's doctrines on these great questions
   makes it difficult to retain a Theism of any kind. [73] This is not
   because a theistic view of tine world is ion itself less reasonable
   than a non-theistic view--to admit this would be to give up the whole
   case on behalf of Christianity. But it is because the kind of Theism
   that remains after the Christian element has been removed out of it, is
   not one fitted to satisfy either the reason or the heart. It is a pale,
   emasculated conception, which, finding no support in the facts or
   experiences of the spiritual life, can never stand against the assaults
   made on it from without. It is here that Pantheism has its advantage
   over Deism. It is indeed more reasonable to believe in a living
   personal God, who created and who controls the universe, than in the
   "One and All" of the pantheist; but it does not follow that it is more
   reasonable to believe in an abstract Deity--a mere figment of the
   intellect--who stands in separation from the world, and yields no
   satisfaction to the religious life. Theism is a reasonable view of the
   universe, but it must be a living Theism, not a barren and notional
   one.

   If, to avoid this bankruptcy, the attempt is made to deal in earnest
   with the conception of a personal God, and to reclothe the Deity with
   the warm, gracious attributes which belong to the Father-God of Christ,
   then we have indeed a Being whom the soul can love, trust, and hold
   communion with, but the difficulty recurs of believing Him to be a God
   who remains self-enclosed, impassive, uncommunicative, towards
   creatures whom He has dowered with a share of His own rational and
   moral excellences, who has so shut Himself out by natural law from
   direct contact with the spirits that seek Him, that He can neither
   speak to them, answer their prayers, help them in trouble nor or even
   reach them by inward succours--a silent God, who can no more enter into
   personal relations with His creatures than if He were impersonal. Such
   a conception is self-contradictory, and cannot maintain itself. One
   feels this incongruity very powerfully in dealing with the Theism of
   such writers as the late Mr. Rathbone Greg, or Dr. Martineau, or the
   authoress of Robert Elsmere. None of these writers will admit the
   possibility of miracle; logically, therefore, they shut out the
   possibility of direct communication between God and man. Yet none of
   them can rest with the cold abstract God of Deism; or with the immanent
   impersonal spirit of Pantheism; or with the comfortless negation of
   Agnosticism. God is with them a personal Being; His will is ethical;
   communion with Him is longed after and believed in. Let Mr. Greg's own
   pathetic words tell how insecure is the Theism thus cut off from
   positive Revelation. "My own conception," he says, "perhaps from early
   mental habit, perhaps from incurable and very conscious metaphysical
   inaptitude, approaches far nearer to the old current image of a
   personal God than to any of the sublimated substitutes of modern
   thought. Strauss's Universum, Comte's Humanity, even Mr. Arnold's
   Stream of Tendency that makes for Righteousness, excite in me no
   enthusiasm, command from me no worship. I cannot pray to the
   Immensities' and the Eternities' of Carlyle; they proffer me no help;
   they vouchsafe me no sympathy; they suggest no comfort. It may be that
   such a personal God is a mere anthropomorphic creation. It may be--as
   philosophers with far finer instruments of thought than mine
   affirm--that the conception of such a Being, duly analysed, is
   demonstrably a self-contradictory one. But, at least in resting in it,
   I rest in something I almost seem to realise; at least, I share the
   view which Jesus indisputably held of the Father whom He obeyed,
   communed with, and worshipped." [74] Surely it need hardly be said that
   a view which, even while holding it, one doubts may be only a result of
   "early mental habit," "a mere anthropomorphic creation," a
   "self-contradictory" conception, cannot long stand as a basis for life;
   nor will the trust which Jesus had help much, when one has already
   rejected as delusion His doctrine of prayer, of special providence, of
   forgiveness of sins, and His own Messianic claims and expectations.
   Already we tremble on the verge of Agnosticism, if we have not actually
   passed its bound.

   I think, accordingly, I am justified in saying that when the ground of
   Divine Revelation is once left behind, we have no logical halting-place
   short of Agnosticism; not because a theistic view of the world is
   unreasonable, but because a living Theism requires as its complement
   belief in Revelation. We have these alternatives: either to revivify
   our Theism till it approaches in the humane and loving attributes it
   ascribes to God, the Christian conception of the Heavenly Father--in
   which case we are back to a supernatural view of the universe; or, if
   this is thought baseless, to dispense with the idea of God altogether,
   and try to explain the world without reason, without final cause,
   without spiritual assumptions of any kind.

   3. Third alternative--A Divine Christ or Pessimism.

   3. Agnosticism is, however, far from representing the end of this road
   along which we had begun to travel in rejecting the Divine in Christ.
   The final alternative--one which we may trust the world at large will
   never be called upon to face--is a Divine Christ or Pessimism.
   Agnosticism is not a state in which the mind of an intelligent being
   can permanently rest. It is essentially a condition of suspense--a
   confession of ignorance--an abdication of thought on the highest
   subjects. [75] It is not, in the nature of things, possible for the
   mind to remain persistently in this neutral, passive attitude. It will
   press on perforce to one or other of the views which present themselves
   as alternatives--either to Theism, or to Materialism and dogmatic
   Atheism. [76] I do not speak, of course, of the individual mind, but of
   the general historical development. But even Agnosticism has brought
   with it a train of baleful results. With the loss of certainty on the
   highest questions of existence there comes inevitably a lowering of the
   pulse of human endeavour all round--a loosening of certainty about
   morals, for why should these remain unaffected when every thing else is
   going?--and as we see to-day, in much of the speculative thought of
   France and Germany, a hopelessness about the future. For, obviously,
   when this point is reached, the rational ground is taken away even from
   belief in progress. [77] When the idea of God, which is equivalent to
   the idea of a reason at the foundation of things, is
   surrendered--whether in Agnosticism, or in some form of dogmatic
   denial, makes little difference--it becomes a wholly unwarranted
   assumption that things must certainly go on from better to better. The
   opposite may quite as well be the case, and progress, now that a given
   height is reached, may rather be from better to worse. The analogy of
   nature shows that this is the law in regard to natural life. The plant
   blooms, reaches its acme, and dies. So, it may be plausibly argued, it
   will be with humanity. The fact that some progress has been made in the
   past does not guarantee that this progress will go on indefinitely;
   rather, the spur to this progress consisted in what we are now told are
   illusions, and when these are exploded the motives to progress are
   gone. A more highly evolved society may lead to an increase of misery
   rather than of happiness; the growth of enlightenment, instead of
   adding to men's enjoyments, may result in stripping them successively
   of the illusions that remain, and may leave them at last sad, weary,
   disappointed, with an intolerable consciousness of the burden and
   wretchedness of existence. [78] All this is not fancy. The despairing,
   pessimistic spirit I am speaking of has already taken hold of extensive
   sections of society, and is giving startling evidences of its presence.
   For the first time on European soil we see large and influential
   systems springing up, and gaining for themselves wide popularity and
   acceptance, which have for their root-idea exactly this conception of
   the inherent irrationality and misery of existence. There have always
   been individual thinkers with a tendency to take a prejudiced and
   hopeless view of life, but their reveries have not been much regarded.
   But here, strange to say, under the very shadow of this boasted
   progress of the nineteenth century--in the very midst of its
   enlightenment and civilisation and wealth--we see Pessimism raising its
   head as a serious, carefully thought-out philosophy of existence, and,
   instead of being scouted and laughed at as an idle dream, it meets with
   passionate acceptance from multitudes. [79] The same spirit will be
   found reflected by those who care to note its symptoms in much of our
   current literature, in the serious raising and discussion, for example,
   of the question already familiar to us--Is life worth living? Specially
   noticeable is the tone of sadness which pervades much of the nobler
   sceptical thinking of the present day--the tone of men who do not think
   lightly of parting with religion, but feel that with it has gone the
   hope and gladness of earlier days. This Pessimism of scepticism is to
   me one of the saddest and most significant phenomena of modern times.
   [80] And, granting the premises it starts from, what other conclusion
   is possible? Deprive the world of God, and everything becomes an
   insoluble mystery, history a scene of wrecked illusions, belief in a
   superstition, and life in general "A tale Told by an idiot, full of
   sound and fury, Signifying nothing." [81]

    II. The upward movement from Pessimism to Christ.

   II. The descent from faith in Christ has landed us in the abyss of
   Pessimism. But just at this lowest point, where the light of religious
   faith might seem utterly extinguished, a return movement is felt to be
   inevitable. For Pessimism, no more than Theism, can escape the
   necessity laid upon it of giving to itself some account of things as
   they are--of constructing a "Weltanschauung"; and the movement it
   attempts to do this, making naked the principle on which it rests, its
   own insufficiency as a philosophy of existence and of life stands
   glaring and confessed. Possibly the attempt to work out Pessimism as a
   system will never be made with much more thoroughness, or with better
   chances of success, than has already been done in the monumental works
   of Schopenhauer and Hartmann. But the very thoroughgoingness of the
   attempt is the demonstration of its futility. Of all theories, that
   which explains the origin of the universe by a mistake--which accounts
   for it by the blind rushing into existence of an irrational force, call
   it "Will" or what we please--is surely the most incredible. [82] How
   came this irrational will-force to be there? What moved it to this
   insensate decision? In what state was it before it committed this
   enormous blunder of rushing into existence? How came it to be possessed
   of that potential wealth of ideas which now are realised in the world?
   Of what use were they if they were never intended to be called into
   existence? What I am at present concerned with, however, is not to
   refute Pessimism, but rather to show how, as a first step in an upward
   movement back to Christ, by its own immanent dialectic it refutes
   itself--inverts, in fact, its own starting-point, and works itself
   round into a species of Theism.

   Schopenhauer and Hartmann both recognise that there is in the universe
   not only "Will," but "Idea," and the manner in which they deal wish
   this element of "Ideal" is one of the most curious examples of the
   inversion of an original starting-point in the history of philosophy.
   For, in the course of its development, Pessimism has actually adopted
   as its leading principle the thought of a rational teleology in the
   universe, and as a consequence, as above remarked, has worked itself
   back to Theism. How this comes about it is not difficult to show. The
   crucial point for all systems of Pessimism is the presence of reason in
   the universe. How, if the basis of the universe is irrational, does
   reason come to find a place in it at all? For, manifestly, account for
   it as we may, there is reason in the universe now. The universe itself
   is a law-connected whole; there is order and plan, organisation and
   system, utility and beauty, means and ends. Above all, in man himself,
   if nowhere else, there is conscious reason--the very instrument by
   which this irrationality of the universe is discovered. There is
   evidently more here than blind, purposeless will. How is its existence
   to be explained? Schopenhauer postulates "Idea." In accounting for
   nature, he has to suppose that in this blind, purposeless will there
   lies potentially a whole world of ideas, representing all the stages
   and kingdoms through which nature advances in the course of its
   history. [83] Hartmann unites "Will" and "Idea" yet more closely,
   regarding them as co-ordinate attributes of the Absolute, though still,
   somehow, the will is supposed to be in itself a purely irrational
   force. It is only when the will has made the mistake of rushing into
   existence that it lays hold on the "Idea" as a means of delivering
   itself from the unblessedness of its new condition. To this end the
   universe is represented as ordered with the highest wisdom, the goal of
   its development being the production of the conscious agent, man,
   through whom the Redemption of the world-spirit is to be accomplished.
   I do not pursue these "metaphysics of wonderland" further. I only
   notice the extraordinary contradictions in which Hartmann involves
   himself in his conception of the Absolute--"the Unconscious," as he
   prefers to term it--and the extraordinary transformation it undergoes
   in his hands. The absolute is unconscious, and needs to create for
   itself an organ of consciousness in man before it can attain
   deliverance from its unblessedness. Yet it knows, plans, contrives,
   orders everything with consummate wisdom, works out its designs with a
   precision that is unerring, etc. [84] The contradiction here is too
   patent. For, if unconscious, how can we speak of this Absolute as
   unblessed? Or how can we think of it as knowing and planning? Hartmann
   therefore changes his ground, and speaks in other places of his
   Absolute rather as supra-conscious; [85] elsewhere, again, in terms
   akin to those of Mr. Spencer, as an "Unknowable"--incapable of being
   represented in forms of our intelligence. [86] But if the Absolute is
   supra-conscious, i.e. exists in a state higher than the ordinary
   consciousness, why should it need the latter to help it out of its
   misery? The climax is reached when, in a later work--while still
   holding to the view that the Absolute is not a self-conscious
   Personality--Hartmann invests it with most of the attributes
   characteristic of Deity, sees in it, e.g., the ground, not only of a
   natural, but of a moral order, makes it the object of religious
   worship, attributes to it, not simply omnipotence and wisdom, but
   righteousness and holiness, views it as a source of Revelation and
   grace, expressly names it God! [87] We are here far enough from the
   original assumption of a primitive, irrational will--in fact, what we
   see is Pessimism passing over in all but the name into Theism. It
   remained only that this transition should be explicitly made, and this
   has been done by a disciple of the school, Karl Peters, whose work,
   Willenswelt und Weltwille is one of the acutest criticisms of previous
   Pessimism I know. With him we finally leave the ground of the
   philosophy of the "Unconscious," and come round to a Theism in which we
   have the full recognition of God as a self conscious, wise, good, holy
   Personality, whose providence is over all, and whose ends all things
   subserve. [88]

   The theories of Schopenhauer and Hartmann, though pessimistic, might
   with equal propriety have been classed in the family of pantheistic
   systems. When dealing at an earlier stage with than downward movement
   from faith in Christ, through Agnosticism to Pessimism, I purposely
   reserved this alternative of Pantheism. This was not because the
   subject is in itself unimportant, but because it comes at last to the
   old dilemma, and can best be treated in its higher aspect as a stage in
   the upward advance to Theism. Pantheism shares the fate of every
   incomplete system, in being compelled to pass judgment on itself, and
   either to sink to something lower, or to pass up to something higher. I
   refer for proof to Germany, which has given birth to some of its
   noblest forms, but where also history shows how possible it is to
   descend at one step from the loftiest heights of overstrained Idealism
   to gross Materialism. Fichte and Schelling and Hegel were followed by
   Strauss and Feuerbach. [89] The logic of the process is again not
   difficult to trace. If universal reason is the all, and the finite in
   comparison with it nothing, in another point of view it is the finite
   that is all, and reason that is nothing, seeing that in the finite only
   it attains to actual existence. Concede the premiss, the Absolute has
   reality only in the universe, and it is but a short step to the
   conclusion, the universe only is real. [90] Interpret the universe now,
   in accordance with the "modern" conception, in terms of matter and
   motion, and Feuerbach's dictum is reached--"Man is what he eats." The
   goal of this is the old plunge into Nihilism and Pessimism, in which we
   have just seen that the mind cannot remain.

   The other alternative is, however, possible to Pantheism, by holding
   fast to the rational element contained in it, to correct and purify
   itself by a return to Theism; and this is the movement we see taking
   place in the latter forms of the philosophies Fichte and Schelling and
   in the speculative Theism of the later Hegelians, In judging of these
   systems, we must not be misled by too narrow a use of the word
   "Theism." The Theism of the writers I refer to is in many respects
   imperfect, and bears throughout the marks of its speculative origin.
   Yet, in principle, the line between Pantheism and Theism is crossed
   whenever God is conceived of no longer as an impersonal Force or Idea,
   but as a spiritual, self-conscious principle at the basis of the
   universe--as a knowing, willing Being, with whom man can sustain, not
   only natural, but moral and spiritual relations. There may be
   difficulties at this stage as to whether the term "personal" is a
   suitable term to apply to the Divine; but it is, nevertheless, a
   theistic conception of God which is shaping itself, and the purgation
   of the system from remaining pantheistic elements is only a question of
   time. What for instance, but an approximation to Theism is implied in
   such words as Fichte's in his fine apostrophe--"Sublime and Living
   Will! named by no name, compassed by no thought! I may well raise my
   soul to Thee, for Thou and I are not divided! Thy voice sounds within
   me, mine resounds in Thee; and all my thoughts, if they be but good and
   true, live in Thee also. . . . Thou art best known to the childlike,
   devoted, simple mind. To it Thou art the searcher of hearts, who seest
   its inmost depths; the ever-present witness of its truth, who knowest
   through all the world know it not. Thou art the Father whoever desirest
   its good, who rulest all things for the best. . . . How Thou art, I may
   not know. But let me be what I ought to be, and Thy relations to
   me--the mortal--and to all mortals, lie open before my eyes, and
   surround me more clearly than the consciousness of my own existence.
   Thou workest in me the knowledge of my duty, of my vocation in the
   world of reasonable beings:--how, I know not, nor need I to know. Thou
   knowest what I think and what I will:--how Thou canst know, through
   what act Thou bringest about that consciousness, I cannot understand.
   . . . Thou willest that my free obedience shall bring with it eternal
   consequences:--the act of Thy will I cannot comprehend, I only know
   thief it is not like mine. Thou doest, and Thy will itself is the deed:
   but the way of Thy working is not as my ways--I cannot trace it." [91]
   If this is Pantheism, are we not all pantheists? If this is
   Agnosticism, is it not an Agnosticism in which we must all share? The
   moment in spiritual Pantheism which impels to this development is of
   course the recognition of the fact that the universe has its ground in
   reason. If this position is to be safeguarded against the lapse into
   Materialism, it must free itself from the internal contradiction of
   supposing that there can be thought without a thinker; [92] reason
   without a subject to which the reason belongs; rational ends posited
   and executed without intelligent and self-conscious purpose; moral
   order without amoral will. In the case of Fichte and Schelling, this
   revolution in their philosophies is seen taking place within their
   lifetime; in the case of Hegel, it is seen in the development of his
   philosophy, in the hands of his disciples, into a speculative Theism.
   In Vatke and Biedermann--two prominent representatives--the Theism is
   still very shadowy and incomplete; in I. H. Fichte and Pfleiderer of
   Berlin, it attains to full and explicit recognition. The latter writer,
   in particular, takes strong ground, and from his own point of view may
   be regarded as one of the ablest defenders of theistic positions in
   recent times. In our own country we have the Neo-Hegelian movement,
   best represented by the late Mr. Green of Oxford, and in him also the
   speculative spirit is seen allying itself very closely with the spirit
   of religion, with the result that his philosophy almost inevitably
   passes over into Theism. On the metaphysical side, God is already to
   Mr. Green an "Eternal Self-Consciousness" [93] --the author and
   sustainer of the system of relations which we call the universe. But,
   on the religious side, He is thought of much more positively as a
   conscious Being who is in eternal perfection all that man has it in him
   to come to be--"a Being of perfect understanding and perfect love "--an
   infinite Spirit, present to the soul, but other than itself, towards
   whom "the attitude of man at his highest and completest could still
   only be that which we have described as self-abasement before an ideal
   of holiness." [94] The metaphysical contradictions which still inhere
   in the Neo-Hegelian theory have been well pointed out by one--formerly
   an ardent Hegelian--who has himself lived through the theory he
   criticises Prof. Seth of Edinburgh. In him, in the line of this
   development, we reach at length a perfectly unambiguous position. "It
   must not be forgotten," he says, "that if we are to keep the name of
   God at all, or any equivalent term, subjectivity--an existence of God
   for Himself, analogous to our own personal existence, though doubtless
   transcending it infinitely in innumerable ways--is an essential element
   of the conception. . . . God may be, must be, infinitely more--we are
   at least certain that He cannot be less--than we know ourselves to be."
   [95]

   The Theism we have thus gained embraces the two notions of God as
   self-conscious reason, and God as moral will. Once, however, this
   ground of Theism is reached, we are compelled, in order to secure it,
   to advance a step further, viz. to the thought of God as
   self-revealing. We have already seen that Theism can only be secured if
   God is thought of as standing in a living relation to mankind--that is,
   as interesting Himself in their welfare, and capable of entering into
   moral and spiritual fellowship with them. How can one earnestly believe
   in a living, personal God, and, on the other hand, in man as a being
   constituted for moral ends, and not also believe that it is the will of
   God that man should know Him, and be guided by Him to the fulfilment of
   his destiny? It is, accordingly, a most noteworthy fact, that in all
   the higher theology of the time-- even rationalistic theology--the
   attempt is made to come to a right understanding with this concept of
   Revelation. Strange as it may sound to many, there is no proposition on
   which theologians of all schools at the present day are more willing to
   agree than this--that all knowledge of God, and consequently all
   religion, rests on Revelation; and that, if the true idea of God is to
   be maintained, He must be thought of as self-revealing. This truth is
   emphasised, not in the orthodox systems alone, but in the theologies,
   e.g., of Biedermann, of Lipsius of Pfleiderer, of Ritschl--even, as I
   said before, of the Pessimist irony, his chapters on Faith and
   Revelation. The point of difference arises when we inquire into the
   nature of Revelation, and specially when we pass from the sphere of
   natural to that of supernatural Revelation Supernatural Revelation the
   theologians of the liberal school--Pfleiderer, Lipsius, etc.--will not
   allow us to speak of; or rather, natural and supernatural are with them
   but different sides of the same process. That which, on the Divine
   side, is viewed as Revelation, is, on the human side, simply the
   natural development of man's moral and religious consciousness, and
   vice versa. In the same way, every truly original moment in the life of
   a man every birth-moment of a new truth in his man, every flash of
   insight into some new secret or law of nature, is a Revelation. This,
   which is the subtlest view of Revelation at present in the field, is
   not to be set aside without an attempt to do justice to what is true in
   it. [96] I am, for my part, not concerned to deny that there is a side
   of truths, and a very important one, in this theory. If it sounds
   deistical to say, "Revelation is only through the natural activities of
   mind"; it may, on the other hand, be a wholesome corrective to a
   deistic view to say that God is immanent in these activities, and that
   through them He mediates His Revelation to the human spirit--that what
   we call the "natural "development of mind involves, when rightly
   understood, a factor of Revelation. Nor can the line ever be drawn so
   finely between natural and supernatural Revelation as to enable us to
   say, "Here precisely the natural ends and the supernatural begins."
   Time theory in question, therefore, I would be disposed to call
   inadequate, rather than false; or false only as it professes to cover
   the whole field of Revelation. For in the latter, it must be contended
   that we have more than can be accounted for by mere natural
   development. Taken even on its own ground, this theory involves the
   valuable admission that it is the will of God to make Himself known to
   man, and that He has provided in the constitution of things for giving
   him the knowledge that is necessary for him. The only criticism I shall
   make at present upon this theory is--and I think it is one which goes
   to the heart of the matter--that in some sense the end of the theory is
   the refutation of the beginning of it. The point from which we start
   is, that God can be known only through the natural activities of the
   mind. He is present in these activities as He is present in all the
   other functions of our mental, moral, and even physical being; and He
   is present in no other way. But the peculiarity of this theory is that
   it ends in a view of God which affirms the possibility of that with the
   denial of which it set out--the possibility of direct communion between
   God and the soul. It is not disputed by any of the advocates of these
   views that the highest point in this self-revelation of God is the
   Revelation given to men Christ through Jesus But the God and Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ is not a Being who communicates with man only in
   the indirect way which this theory supposes He is a Being who Himself
   draws near to man, and seeks fellowship with him; whose relations with
   the spirits He has made are free and personal; who is as lovingly
   communicative as man, on his part, is expected to be trustfully
   receptive; to whom man can speak, and He answers. The simply natural is
   here transcended, and we are in the region of direct intercourse of
   spirit with spirit. And this view of God is not disputed by the writers
   I am here referring to, who deny supernatural Revelation. Dr. Martineau
   says, in words of deep wisdom, "How should related spirits, joined by a
   common creative aim, intent on whatever things are pure and good, live
   in presence of each other, the one the bestower, the other the
   recipient of a sacred trust, and exchange no thought and give no sign
   of the love which subsists between them?" [97] Pfleiderer again says,
   "And why should it be less possible for God to enter into a loving
   fellowship with us, than for men to do so with each other? I should be
   inclined to think that He is even more capable of doing so. For as no
   man can altogether read the soul of another, so no man can altogether
   live in the soul of another; hence all our human love is and remains
   imperfect. But if we are shut off from one another by the limits of
   individuality, in relation to God it is not so; to Him our hearts are
   as open as each man's own heart is to himself; He sees through and
   through them, and He desires to live in them, and to fill them with His
   own sacred energy and blessedness." [98] True, why not? But if this is
   admitted, what becomes of the theory that the action of God in
   Revelation is necessarily bound up within the limits of strict natural
   law? If the gates of intercourse are thus open between the human soul
   and God, is it either natural or probable that God will not enter in at
   them, and that, instead of leaving men simply to feel after Him if
   haply they may find Him, He will not at some point give them what
   supernatural light and aid they need to bring them to the true
   knowledge of Himself, and fit them for the attainment of the highest
   ends of their, existence? Certainly, in light of the above admissions,
   no a priori objection can be raised to the principle of supernatural
   Revelation

   The legitimate outcome of this theory is, that in addition to general
   Revelation through reason, conscience, and nature, there is to be
   expected some special Revelation; and even this, in a certain way, is
   admitted, for it is conceded by nearly all the writers I have named
   that in the providential plan of the world a peculiar function was
   assigned to Israel; that, as the different nations of the world have
   their several providential tasks (Greece--art, culture, philosophy;
   Rome--law, government, etc.), to Israel was given the task of
   developing the idea of God to its highest perfection in ethical
   Monotheism. [99] And, finally, it is conceded that this self-revelation
   of God reaches its culmination in Jesus Christ, whose Person has
   world-historical significance, as bearing in it the principle of the
   perfect relation between God and men--of the absolute religious
   relation. [100] The line between natural and supernatural Revelation is
   here, surely, becoming very thin; and it is therefore, perhaps, not
   greatly to be wondered at that the latest school in German
   theology--that of Ritschl--should take the short remaining step, and be
   marked by precisely this tendency to lay stress on the need and reality
   of positive Revelation. The general position of this school may be
   fairly summed up by saying that God can only be truly known to us by
   personal, positive Revelation, in which He actually enters into
   historical relations with mankind; and that this Revelation has been
   given in the Person of His Son Jesus Christ. Through this Revelation
   alone, but in it perfectly, we have the true knowledge of God's
   character, of His world-aim in the establishing of a kingdom of God on
   earth, and of His gracious will of forgiveness and love. [101] Whatever
   theory of Revelation we adopt, Jesus Christ must be pronounced to be
   the highest organ of it. On this point all deep and serious thinkers of
   our age may be held to be agreed. Thus, then, we are brought back to
   Christ, are led to recognise in Him the medium of a true Revelation;
   and it only remains to ask, What do the facts of this Revelation, and
   of Christ's own self-testimony, properly construed, imply? We have
   already seen what the verdict of history is on this point, to what
   alternatives it shuts us up in our treatment of this subject. We shall
   afterwards see by examination of the facts themselves how this verdict
   is justified.

   To sum up, we have seen that two movements are to be discerned in
   history: the one a downward movement leading away from Christ, and
   resulting from the denial of, or tampering with, His full Divinity; the
   other, an upward movement, retracting the stages of the earlier
   descent, and bringing us back to the confession of Thomas, "My Lord and
   my God." [102] The former movement ends in the gulf of Nihilism and
   Pessimism; the latter begins from the impossibility of the mind abiding
   permanently in the denial of a rational basis for the universe. But
   here, as in the downward movement, the logic of history asserts itself.
   Belief in a rational basis of the universe can only secure itself
   through return to Theism; a living Theism can only secure itself
   through belief in God as self-revealing; belief in Revelation leads
   historically to the recognition of Christ as the highest organ of God's
   self-revelation to mankind; belief in Christ as Revealer can only
   secure itself through belief in His Divinity. "Ye believe in God," said
   Jesus; "believe also in Me." [103] Belief in God--theistic
   belief--presses on to belief in Christ, and can only secure itself
   through it. On the other hand, belief in Christ has for its legitimate
   outcome belief in God. The two beliefs, as history demonstrates, stand
   or fall together.

   man; the life of the plant is better than that of the fish in the
   water, or even of the oyster on the rock. Non-being is better than

   best would be if all existence were annihilated. "Cf. Luthardt, Die

   [82] These Pessimistic theories are not without their roots in the
   philosophies of Fichte. Schelling, and Hegel. Cf. Fichte's view of the
   Absolute as "Will" and Sehelling's "irrational" ground of the Divine
   nature (after Bohme). in his Philosophie und Religion (1801), Schelling
   boldly describes the creation as the result of an "Abfall"--the
   original assertion by the Ego of its independence. "This inexplicable
   and timeless act is the original sin or primal fall of the spirit,
   which we expiate in the circles of time existence" (cf. Professor
   Seth's From Kant to Hegel, p. 65). Hegel also, in his own way, speaks
   of creation as an "Abfall." It is in the Son," he says, "in the
   determination of distinction, that progressive determination proceeds
   to further distinction. . . . This transition in the moment of the Son
   is thus expressed by Jacob Bohme--that the first-born was Lucifer, the
   light-hearer the bright, the clear one; but he turned in upon himself
   in imagination; i.e. he made himself independent, passed over into
   being, and so fell."--Phil. d. Rel. ii. p. 251 (Werke, vol. xii.).

   [83] Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, i. pp. 1 85. 206 (Eng. trans.
   pp. 203, 219 ff.). Karl Peters remarks: "If the Will alone bears in
   itself the stages of the World-All as eternal ideas--how can
   Schopenhauer call it an absolutely irrational Will? And if he conceives
   of it as a radically blind Will as an insane and altogether groundless
   Drang,' how can he vindicate for it these eternal ideas?"--Willenswelt,
   p. 129.

   [84] "The Unconscious wills in one act all the terms of a process,
   means and end, etc., not before, beside, or beyond, but in the result
   itself."--Phil. d. Unbewussten, ii. p. 60 (Eng. trans.).

   [85] The Unconscious, it now appears, has after all a kind of
   consciousness--is "a transcendent supra-mundane consciousness any thing
   but blind , rather far-seeing and clairvoyant," "superior to all
   consciousness, at once conscious and supra-conscious" (!), its "mode of
   thinking is, in truth, above consciousness."--Phil. d. Unbewussten, pp.
   246, 247, 258 etc. (Eng. trans.).

   [86] Phil. d. Unbewussten, pp. 49, 223, 246, etc. (Eng. trans.).
   Schopenhauer also declares his "Will" to be in itself, i.e. apart from
   its phenomenal manifestations, an Unknowable, possibly possessing ways
   of existing, determinations, qualities, which are absolutely unknowable
   and incomprehensible to us, and which remain ever as its nature when it
   has abrogated its phenomenal character, and for our knowledge has
   passed into empty nothingness.--Die Welt als Wille (Eng. trans.), ii.

   incompetency, we must summon up all our hardihood, and openly confess

APPENDIX TO LECTURE II.

  THE PESSIMISM OF SCEPTICISM.

   ALL the writers on Pessimism dwell on the strangeness of the fact that
   a century like our own, so marked by mental and material progress, by
   vigour and enterprise, should witness a revival of this gospel of
   despair; and bear emphatic testimony to the breadth and depth of the
   influence which the pessimistic systems are exercising. Apart, however,
   from the definite acceptance of Pessimism as a creed, it is instructive
   to note the many indications which literature affords of the sad and
   hopeless spirit which seems the necessary outcome of the surrender of
   religious faith. A few illustrations of this Pessimism of scepticism,
   culled almost at random, will perhaps not be out of place.

   Voltaire was not happy. Dr. Cairns writes regarding him: "How little he
   himself was contented with his own results appears in the gloom shed
   over his later writings. It is not in Candide alone, but in others of
   them that this sadness comes to light. Thus, in his dialogue, Les
   Louanges de Dieu,' the doubter almost carries it over the
   adorer--'strike out a few sages, and the crowd of human beings is
   nothing but a horrible assemblage of unfortunate criminals, and the
   globe contains nothing but corpses. I tremble to have to complain once
   more of the Being of beings, in casting an attentive eye over this
   terrible picture. I wish I had never been born.' . . . Thus the last
   utterance of Voltaire's system is a groan." [104]

   A deep pessimism lurked in the background of the genial optimism of
   Goethe. Thus he expresses himself in conversation with Eckermann: "I
   have ever been esteemed one of fortune's chiefest favourites; nor will
   I complain or find fault with the course my life has taken. Yet truly
   there has been nothing but toil and care; and I may say that in all my
   seventy-five years I have never had a month of genuine comfort. It has
   been the perpetual rolling of a stone which I have always had to raise
   anew." His views of the future of the race were not hopeful. "Men will
   become more clever and more acute, but not better, happier, and
   stronger in action, or at least only at epochs. I foresee the time when
   God will have no more joy in them, but will break up everything for a
   renewed creation." [105] There are numerous such utterances.

   Renan writes in the preface to his recently published work, The Future
   of Science, originally composed in the years 1848-49--"To sum up: if,
   through the constant labour of the nineteenth century, the knowledge of
   facts has considerably increased, the destiny of mankind has, on the
   other hand, become more obscure than ever. The serious thing is that we
   fail to perceive a means of providing humanity in the future with a
   catechism that will be acceptable henceforth, except on the condition
   of returning to a state of credulity. Hence it is possible that the
   ruin of idealistic beliefs may be fated to follow hard upon the ruin of
   supernatural beliefs, and that the real abasement of the morality of
   humanity will date from the day it has seen the reality of things.
   . . . Candidly speaking, I fail to see how, without the ancient dreams,
   the foundations of a happy and noble life are to be relaid." [106]

   The late Professor Clifford is quoted as saying: "It cannot be doubted
   that the theistic belief is a comfort to those who hold it, and that
   the loss of it is a very painful loss. It cannot be doubted, at least
   by many of us in this generation, who either profess it now, or have
   received it in our childhood, and have parted from it since with such
   searching trouble as only cradle-faiths can cause. We have seen the
   spring sun shine out of an empty heaven to light up a soulless earth;
   we have felt with utter loneliness that the Great Companion is dead."
   [107]

   Professor Seeley, in the close of his work on Natural Religion, thus
   sums up: "When the supernatural does not come in to overwhelm the
   natural, and turn life upside down, when it is admitted that religion
   deals in the first instance with the known and natural, then we may
   well begin to doubt whether the known and the natural can suffice for
   human life. No sooner do we try to think so than Pessimism raises its
   head. The more our thoughts widen and deepen, as the universe grows
   upon us and we become accustomed to boundless space and time, the more
   petrifying is the contrast of our own insignificance, the more
   contemptible become the pettiness, shortness, and fragility of the
   individual life. A moral paralysis creeps over us. For a while we
   comfort ourselves with the notion of self-sacrifice; we say, What
   matter if I pass, let me think of others! But the other has become
   contemptible no less than the self; all human griefs alike seem little
   worth assuaging, hum an happiness too paltry at the best to be worth
   increasing. . . . The affections die away in a world where everything
   great and enduring is cold; they die of their own conscious feebleness
   and bootlessness." [108]

   Of similar purport is a passage often quoted from A Candid Examination
   of Theism, by "Physicus." "Forasmuch," this writer says, "as I am far
   from being able to agree with those who affirm that the twilight
   doctrine of the new faith' is a desirable substitute for the waning
   splendour of the old,' I am not ashamed to confess that, with this
   virtual negation of God, the universe to me has lost its soul of
   loveliness; and although from henceforth the precept to work while it
   is day' will doubtless but gain an intensified force from the terribly
   intensified meaning of the words, The night cometh when no man can
   work,' yet, when at times I think, as think at times I must, of the
   appalling contrast between the hallowed glory of that creed which once
   was mine, and the lonely mystery of existence as I new find it, at such
   times I shall ever feel it impossible to avoid the sharpest pang of
   which my nature is susceptible. For, whether it be due to my
   intelligence not being sufficiently advanced to meet the requirements
   of the age, or whether it be duo to the memory of those sacred
   associations which, to me at least, were the sweetest that life has
   given, l cannot but feel that for me, and for others who think as I do,
   there is a dreadful truth in those words of Hamilton,-- philosophy
   having become a meditation, not merely of death, but of annihilation,
   the precept know thyself has become transformed into the terrible
   oracle to OEdipus, Mayest thou never know the truth of what thou art.'"
   [109]

   Theodore Jouffory, the French philosopher, wrote: "Never shall I forget
   the December evening when the veil which hid my unbelief from mine own
   eyes was torn away. . . . The hours of the night glided away, and I
   perceived it not; I anxiously followed my thought, which descended step
   by step to the bottom of my consciousness, and dissipating, one after
   another, all the illusions which till then had hid them from my view,
   rendered its subterfuges more and more visible to me. In vain I clung
   to my last beliefs, as a shipwrecked sailor to the fragments of his
   ship; in vain, terrified by the unknown waste in which I was about to
   float, I threw myself back once more upon my childhood, my family, my
   country, all that was dear and sacred to me; the inflexible current of
   my thought was the stronger; parents, family, memories, beliefs--it
   forced me to leave all. This examination became more obstinate and more
   severe as it approached the end; nor did it stop till the end was
   reached. I knew then that at the bottom of myself there was nothing
   left standing, that all I had believed about myself, about God, and
   about my destiny in this life and in that to come, I now believed no
   more. This moment was frightful; and when, towards morning, I threw
   myself exhausted upon my bed, it seemed to me as if I could feel my
   former life, so cheerful and complete, die away, and before me there
   opened up another life, dark and dispeopled, where henceforth I was to
   live alone, alone with my fatal thought which had just exiled me
   thither, and which I was tempted to curse." [110]

   Here is Professor Huxley's estimate of human progress: "I know," he
   says, "no study which is so unutterably saddening as that of the
   evolution of humanity, as it is set forth in the annals of history. Out
   of the darkness of prehistoric ages man emerges with the marks of his
   lowly origin strong upon him. He is a brute, only more intelligent than
   the other brutes; a blind prey to impulses which as often as not lead
   him to destruction; a victim to endless illusions, which make his
   mental existence a terror and a burden, and fill his physical life with
   barren toil and battle. He attains a certain degree of physical
   comfort, and develops a more or less workable theory of life, in such
   favourable situations as the plains of Mesopotamia or of Egypt, and
   then, for thousands and thousands of years, struggles with varying
   fortunes, attended by infinite wickedness, bloodshed, and misery, to
   maintain himself at this point against the greed and ambition of his
   fellow-men. He makes a point of killing and otherwise persecuting all
   those who first try to get him to move on; and when he has moved on a
   step foolishly confers post-mortem deification on his victims. He
   exactly repeats the process with all who want to move a step yet
   further. And the best men of the best epochs are simply those who make
   the fewest blunders, and commit the fewest sins." [111] The passage is
   in protest against the Positivist "worship of Humanity."

   In further illustration of the Pessimism of scepticism, I may refer to
   two instructive magazine articles--one by Emile de Laveleye on "The
   Future of Religion," in The Contemporary Review for July 1888; and the
   other by Mr. F. W. H. Myers on "The Disenchantment of France," in The
   Nineteenth Century for May 1888. To quote only a sentence or two, M.
   Laveleye remarks: "It seems as if humanity could not exist without
   religion as a spiritual atmosphere, and we see that, as this decreases,
   despair and Pessimism take hold of minds thus deprived of solace.
   Madame Ackermann well expresses this in some lines addressed to Faith,
   in which she writes--

   'Eh bien, nous l'expulsons de tes divins
   roysumes, Dominatrice ardente, et l'instant
   est venu; Tu ne vas plus savoir ou loger tes
   fantomes, Nous fermons l'Inconnu!

   Mais ton triumphateur expiera ta defaite,
   L'homme deja se trouble et, vainqueur
   eperdu, Il se sent ruine par sa propre
   conquete; En te despossedant nous avons
   tout perdu. Nous restons sans espoir, sans
   recours, sans asile, Tandis qu' obstinement
   le desir qu'on exile Revient errer autour du
   gouffre defendu.'

   "Incurable sadness takes hold of the man who has no hope of anything
   better than this life, short as it is, and overwhelmed with trials of
   all kinds, where iniquity triumphs if it have but force on its side,
   and where men risk their lives in disputes with each other for a place
   where there is too little space for all, and the means of subsistence
   are wholly insufficient. Some German colonies have been founded in
   America, in which all sorts of Divine worship are prescribed; those who
   have visited them describe the colonists, the women especially, as
   appearing exceedingly sad. Life with no hope in the future loses its
   savour." [112]

   Mr. Myers's article on the progress of disillusionment in France, "to
   use the phrase of commonest recurrence in modern French literature and
   speech," is one fitted to open many eyes as to the inevitable drift of
   unbelief to Pessimism. In 1788 France possessed illusions and nothing
   else,--"the reign of reason, the return to nature, the social contract,
   liberty, equality, fraternity,--the whole air of that wild time buzzed
   with new-hatched chimeras"; in 1888 France possesses everything except
   illusions; and the end is "the vague but general sense of malaise or
   decadence, which permeates so much of modern French literature and
   life," and of which abundant illustrations are given. Not the least
   striking of these is a passage from Emile Littre, the once enthusiastic
   Comtist, who likens his own final mood to that of the Trojan women who
   pontum aspectabant flentes! "Fit epigraph," says Mr. Myers, "for a race
   who have fallen from hope, on whose ears the waves' world-old message
   still murmurs without a meaning; while the familiar landmarks fall back
   into shadow, and there is nothing but the sea." [113]

   These illustrations, which might be multiplied indefinitely
   sufficiently confirm the words of Mr. Sully in his work on Pessimism:
   [114] "I am keenly alive to the fact that our scheme of individual
   happiness, even when taken as including the good of others now living
   and to live, is no perfect substitute for the idea of eternal happiness
   presented in religon. Nobody, I imagine, would seriously contend that
   the aims of our limited earthly existence, even when our imagination
   embraces generations to follow us, are of so inspiring a character as
   the objects presented by religion. . . . Into the reality of these
   religious beliefs I do not here enter. I would only say that if men are
   to abandon all hope of a future life, the loss, in point of cheering
   and sustaining influence, will be a vast one, and one not to be made
   good, so far as I can see, by any new idea of services to collective
   humanity."

LECTURE III.

THE THEISTIC POSTULATE OF THE CHRISTIAN VIEW.

    Introductory

   In entering on the task of unfolding the Christian view of the world
   under its positive aspects, and of considering its relations to modern
   thought, I begin where religion itself begins, with the existence of
   God. Christianity is a theistic system; this is the first
   postulate--the personal, ethical, self-revealing God.

   Volkmar has remarked that of monotheistic religions there are only
   three in the world--the Israelitish, the Christian, and the Mohammedan;
   and the last-named is derived from the other two. "So," he adds, "is
   the Israel of God' the one truly religious, the religiously-elect,
   people of antiquity; and ancient Israel remains for each worshipper of
   the one, therefore of the true God, who alone is worthy of the name,
   the classical people. . . . Christianity is the blossom and fruit of
   the true worship of God in Israel, which has become such for all
   mankind." [115] This limitation of Monotheism in religion to the
   peoples who have benefited by the Biblical teaching on this subject,
   suggests its origin from a higher than human source; and refutes the
   contention of those who would persuade us that the monotheistic idea is
   the result of a long process of development through which the race
   necessarily passes, beginning with Fetishism, or perhaps Ghost-worship,
   mounting to Polytheism, and ultimately subsuming the multitude of
   Divine powers under one all-controlling will. It will be time enough to
   accept this theory when, outside the line of the Biblical development,
   a single nation can be pointed to which has gone through these stages,
   and reached this goal. [116]

   I should like further at the outset to direct attention to the fact
   that, in affirming the existence of God as Theism apprehends Him, we
   have already taken a great step into the supernatural, a step which
   should make many others easy. Many speak glibly of the denial of the
   supernatural, who never realise how much of the supernatural they have
   already admitted in affirming the existence of a personal, wise, holy,
   and beneficent Author of the universe. They may deny supernatural
   actions in the sense of miracles, but they have affirmed supernatural
   Being on a scale and in a degree which casts supernatural action quite
   into the shade. If God is a reality, the whole universe rests on a
   supernatural basis. A supernatural presence pervades it; a supernatural
   power sustains it; a supernatural will operates in its forces; a
   supernatural wisdom appoints its ends. The whole visible order of
   things rests on another, an unseen, spiritual, supernatural order,--and
   is the symbol, the manifestation, the revelation of it. It is therefore
   only to be expected that the feeling should grow increasingly in the
   minds of thoughtful men, float if this supernatural basis of the
   universe is to he acknowledged, a great deal more must be admitted
   besides. On the other hand, if the opposition to the supernatural is to
   be carried out to its logical issue, it must not stop with the denial
   of miracle, but must extend to the whole theistic conception. This is
   the secret of the intimate connection which I showed in last Lecture to
   exist between the idea of God and the idea of Revelation. A genuine
   Theism Can never long remain a bare Theism. At the height to which
   Christianity has raised our thoughts of God, it is becoming constantly
   more difficult for minds that reflect seriously to believe in a God who
   does not manifest Himself in word and deed. This is well brought out in
   a memorable conversation which Mr. Froude had with Mr. Carlyle in the
   last days of his life. "I once said to him," says Mr. Froude, "not long
   before his death, that I could only believe in a God which did
   something. With a cry of pain, which I shall never forget, he said, He
   does nothing.'" [117] This simply means that if we are to retain the
   idea of a hiving God, we must be in earnest with it. We must believe in
   a God who expresses Himself in hiving deeds in the history of mankind,
   who has a word and message for mankind, who, having the power and the
   will to bless man kind, does it. Theism, as I contended before, needs
   Revelation to complete it.

   Here, accordingly, it is that the Christian view of God has ifs
   strength against any conception of God based on mere grounds of natural
   theology. It hinds together, in the closest reciprocal relations, the
   two ideas of God and Revelation. The Christian doctrine, while
   including all thief the word Theism ordinarily covers, is much more
   than a doctrine of simple Theism. God, in the Christian view, is a
   Being who enters into the history of the world in the most hiving way.
   He is not only actively present in the material universe,--ordering,
   guiding, controlling it.--but He enters also in the most direct way
   into the course of human history, working in it in His general and
   special providence, and by a gradual and progressive Revelation, which
   is, at flue same time, practical discipline and education, giving to
   man that knowledge of Himself by which he is enabled to attain the
   highest ends of his own existence, and to co-operate freely in the
   carrying out of Divine ends; above all, discovering Himself as the God
   of Redemption, who, full of long-suffering and mercy, executes in
   loving deeds, and at infinite sacrifice, His gracious purpose for the
   salvation of mankind. The Christian view of God is thus bound up with
   all the remaining elements of the Christian system,--with the idea of
   Revelation in Christ, with a kingdom of God to be realised through
   Christ, with Redemption from sin in Christ,--and it is inseparable from
   them. It is through these elements--not in its abstract character as
   Theism--that it takes the held it does on the living convictions of
   men, and is felt by them to be something real. If I undertake to defend
   Theism, it is not Theism in dissociation from Revelation, but Theism as
   completed in the entire Christian view.

   It is scarcely necessary that I should prove that Christ's teaching
   about God embraces all the affirmations commonly understood to be
   implied in a complete Theism. Christ's doctrine of the Father is,
   indeed, entirely unmetaphysical. We meet with no terms such as
   absolute, infinite, unconditioned, first cause, etc., with which the
   student of philosophy is familiar. Yet all that these terms imply is
   undeniably recognised by Jesus in His teaching about God. He takes up
   into His teaching--as the apostles likewise do--all the natural truth
   about God; He takes up all the truth about God's being, character,
   perfections, and relations to the world and man, already given in the
   Old Testament. God, with Jesus, is unquestionably the sole and supreme
   source of existence; He by whom all things were created, and on whom
   all things depend; the Lord of heaven and earth, whose power and rule
   embrace the smallest as well as the greatest events of life; the
   Eternal One, who sees the end from the beginning, and whose vast
   counsels hold in their grasp the issues of all things. The attributes
   of God are similarly dealt with. They are never made by Christ the
   subject of formal discourse, are never treated of for their own sakes,
   or in their metaphysical relations. They come into view solely in their
   religious relations. Yet no one will dispute that all the attributes
   involved in the highest theistic conception--eternity, omnipotence,
   omnipresence, omniscience, and the like--are implied in His teaching.
   God, in Christ's view, is the all-wise, all-present, all-powerful
   Being, at once infinitely exalted above the world, and active in every
   part of it, from whose eyes, seeing in secret, nothing can be hid,
   laying His plans in eternity, and unerringly carrying them out. It is
   the peculiarity of Christ's teaching, however, that the natural
   attributes are always viewed in subordination to the moral. In respect
   of these, Christ's view of God resembles that of the Old Testament in
   its union of the two ideas of God's unapproachable majesty and
   elevation above the world as the infinitely Holy One; and of His
   condescending grace and continued action in history for the salvation
   and good of men. The two poles in the ethical perfection of God's
   character are with Him, as with the prophets of the old covenant,
   righteousness and love--the former embracing His truth, faithfulness,
   and justice; the latter His beneficence, compassion, long suffering,
   and mercy. Ritschl, indeed, in his treatment of this subject, will
   recognise no attribute but love, and makes all the others, even the
   so-called physical attributes, but aspects of love. Righteousness,
   e.g., is but the self-consistency of God in carrying out His purposes
   of love, and connotes nothing judicial. [118] Righteousness, however,
   has its relatively independent place as an attribute of God in both Old
   and New Testaments, and cannot thins be set aside. It has reference to
   indefeasible distinctions of right and wrong--to moral norms, which
   even love must respect. Out of righteousness and love in the character
   of God, again, issues wrath--another idea which modern thought tries to
   weaken, but which unquestionably holds an important place in the view
   of God given us by Christ. By wrath is meant the intense moral
   displeasure with which God regards sin--His holy abhorrence of it--and
   the punitive energy of His nature which He puts forth against it. So
   regarded, it is not opposed to love, but, on the contrary, derives its
   chief intensity from the presence of love, and is a necessary element
   in the character of an ethically perfect Being. [119] While, however,
   Christ's teaching about the character of God is grounded on that of the
   Old Testament, yet in the purity and perfection with which He
   apprehends this ethical perfection of God,--above all, in the new light
   in which He places it by His transforming conception of the Divine
   Fatherhood, we feel that we are carried far beyond the stage of the Old
   Testament. God, as ethical Personality, is viewed by Christ, first, as
   in Himself the absolutely Good One--"There is none good but one, that
   is, God"; [120] second, as the perfect Archetype of goodness for man a
   imitation--"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
   heaven is perfect"; [121] third, as the moral Will binding the universe
   together, and proscribing the law of conduct--"Thy will be done on
   earth, as it is in heaven"; [122] but, fourth, pre-eminently as the
   Father. It is in the name Father, as expressive of a special loving and
   gracious relation to the individual members of His kingdom, that
   Christ's doctrine of God specially sums itself up. The Old Testament
   knew God as tire Father of the nation; Christ knew Him as tire Father
   of the individual soul, begotten by Him to a new life, and standing to
   Him in a new moral and spiritual relation, as a member of the kingdom
   of His Son.

   This, then, without further delineation in detail, is the first
   postulate of Christianity--a God living, personal, ethnical,
   self-revealing, infinite. We have new to ask--How does this postulate
   of the Christian view stand related to modern thought, and no the
   general religious consciousness of mankind? How far is it corroborated
   or negated by modern thought? What is the nature of the corroboration,
   and what the worth of the negation? I shall consider the negation
   first.

    I. The negation of the Christian view.

   I. Dogmatic Atheism has not so many advocates--at least in this
   country--as at some former times ; but, instead, we have a wide
   prevalence of that new form of negation which is called Agnosticism. I
   have already referred to this as one of the alternatives to which the
   mind is driven in its denial of the supernatural view of Christ's
   Person; but it is new necessary to consider it on its own merits. The
   thought may occur that this widespread phase of present-day unbelief is
   not properly described as "negation," seeing that all it affirms is,
   that it "does not know." It does not say, "There is no God," but only
   that it does not know that there is one. Its ground is that of
   ignorance, lack of evidence, suspense of judgment--not positive denial.
   This plea, however, is on various grounds inadmissible. It is certainly
   not the case that thorough-going, reasoned-out Agnosticism, as we have
   it, for example, in the works of Mr. Spencer, is simply the modest
   assertion that it does not know whether there is a God or not. It is
   the dogmatic affirmation, based on an examination of the nature and
   limits of human intelligence, that God--or, in Mr. Spencer's phrase,
   the Power which manifests itself in consciousness and in the outward
   universe--is unknowable. [123] But in all its forms, even the mildest,
   Agnosticism is entitled to be regarded as a negation of the Christian
   view, for two reasons. First, in affirming that God is not, or cannot
   be, known, it directly negates, not only the truths of God's natural
   Revelation, which Christianity presupposes, but the specific Christian
   assertion that God can be and is known through the of His historical
   Revelations, and supremely through His Son Jesus Christ. "The only
   begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared
   Him." [124] And, second, if God exists, it is impossible in the nature
   of things that there should not be evidence of His existence, and
   therefore the denial of such evidence is actually tantamount to the
   denial of His existence. Why do I say this? It is because the truths
   about God differs from every other truth in just this respect, that if
   it is truth it must be capable of a certain measure of rational
   demonstration. For God is not simply one Being among others. He is the
   necessary Being. He is the Being whose existence is necessarily
   involved in the existence of every other being. Thin whole universe,
   ourselves as part of it, stands in a relation of necessary dependence
   upon Him. God, therefore, is unlike every other being our thought can
   take account of. Oilier beings may exist, and we may have no evidence
   of their existence. But it is rationally inconceivable that such an
   all-comprehending Reality as we call God should exist, and that through
   Him the whole material and spiritual universe should come into being,
   arid yet no trace be found connecting this universe with its Author--so
   vast an effect with its cause. If even man, for however short a space
   of time, sets foot on an uninhabited island, we expect, if we visit his
   retreat, to find some traces of his occupation How much more, if this
   universe owes its existence to infinite wisdom and power, if God is
   unceasingly present and active in every part of it, must we expect to
   find evidence of thin fact? Therefore, I say that denial of all
   evidence for God's existence is equivalent to the affirmation that
   there is no God. If God is, thought must be able, nay, is compelled, to
   take account of His existence. It must explore the relations in which
   He stands to us and to than world. An obligation rests on it to do so.
   To think of God is a duty of love, but it is also a task of science.
   Mr. Spencer is so far in agreement with the views just expressed, that
   he maintains that our thought is compelled to posit the existence of an
   absolute Being as the ground and cause of than universe, though of than
   nature of this ultimate reality he holds that we can form no
   conception. The reason given is, that our minds, being finite and
   conditioned in their thinking, cannot form a conception of an existence
   which lies outside these conditions. [125] The question, however, is
   pertinent--If the mind is thus hemmed up within the limits of its
   finitude, how does it get to know even that an Absolute exists? Or if
   we can so far transcend the limits of our thought as to know that the
   Absolute exists--which is a disproof of the position that thought is
   restricted wholly to the finite--why may we not also have some
   knowledge of its nature? It is not difficult to show that, in his
   endeavours to extricate himself from these difficulties, Mr. Spencer
   involves himself in a mass of self-contradictions. He tells us, e.g.,
   in every variety of phrase, that we cannot know the Absolute, but
   almost in the same breath he tells us that we have an idea of the
   Absolute which our minds are compelled to form, [126] --that it is a
   positive, and not, as Sir William Hamilton and Mr. Mansel held, a
   merely negative conception, [127] --nay, that we have not only a
   conception, but a direct and immediate consciousness of this Absolute,
   blending itself with all our thoughts and feelings, and recognisable by
   us as such. [128] Again, if we ask, What is meant by the Absolute? it
   is defined as that which exists out of all relations, and for this
   reason the possibility of a knowledge of it is denied. [129] But if we
   inquire further what ground we have for affirming the existence of such
   an Absolute, existing out of all relations, we find that the only
   ground alleged is the knowledge we have of it as standing in relations.
   [130] For this, which Mr. Spencer names the Absolute, is simply the
   Infinite Power which he elsewhere tells us manifests itself in all that
   is--in nature and in consciousness--and is a constituent element in
   every idea we can form. The Absolute, therefore, stands in relation to
   both matter and mind--has, so far as we can see, its very nature in
   that relation. It is not, it turns out, a Being which exists out of all
   relations, but rather, like the Christian God, a self-revealing Power,
   manifesting itself, if not directly yet indirectly, in its workings in
   the worlds of matter and of mind. How strange to speak of a Power thus
   continually manifesting itself in innumerable ways, the consciousness
   of which, on Mr. Spencer's own showing, [131] constantly wells up
   within us, as absolutely unknown or unknowable!

   But, after all, as we by and by discover, this Inscrutable Power of Mr.
   Spencer's is not absolutely unknowable. It soon becomes apparent that
   there are quite a number of affirmations we are able to make regarding
   it, some of them almost of a theistic character. They are made, I
   admit, generally under a kind of protest, [132] yet it is difficult to
   see why, if they are not seriously meant--if they do not convey some
   modicum of knowledge--they should be made at all. According to Mr.
   Spencer, this ultimate reality is a Power: it is a force, the nearest
   analogue to which is our own will: [133] it is infinite, it is eternal,
   it is omnipresent; [134] it is an infinite and eternal Energy from
   which all things proceed; [135] it is the Cause of the universe,
   standing to it in a relation similar to that of the creative power of
   the Christian conception. [136] Numerous other statements might be
   quoted all more or less implying knowledge, --as, e.g., that "the Power
   manifested throughout the Universe distinguished as material, is the
   same Power which in ourselves wells up under the form of consciousness
   ": while the necessity we are under to think of the external energy in
   terms of the internal energy gives rather a spiritualistic than a
   materialistic aspect to the Universe." [137] This I take leave to say,
   so far from being Agnosticism, would more correctly be described as a
   qualified Gnosticism. [138] Mr. Spencer's so-called Agnosticism is not
   an agnostic system at but a of non-material all, system or
   semi-spiritual Pantheism. If we know all that these statements imply
   about the Absolute, there is no bar in principle to our knowing a great
   deal more. A significant proof of this is the development which the
   system has received in the hands of one of Mr. Spencer's disciples, Mr.
   Fiske, who in his Cosmic Philosophy, and still more in his book on The
   Idea of God, has wrought it out into a kind of Theism. He discards the
   term "Unknowable," and writes: "It is enough to remind the reader that
   Deity is unknowable, just in so far as it is not manifested to
   consciousness through the phenomenal world; knowable, just in so far as
   it is thus manifested; unknowable, in so far as infinite and absolute;
   knowable, in the order of its phenomenal manifestations; knowable, in a
   symbolic way, as the Power which is disclosed in every throb of the
   mighty rhythmic life of the universe; knowable, as tire eternal Source
   of a Moral Law, which is implicated with each action of our lives, arid
   in obedience to which lies our only guaranty of the happiness which is
   incorruptible, and which neither inevitable misfortune nor unmerited
   obloquy can take away. Thus, though we may not by searching find out
   God, though we may not compass infinitude, or attain to absolute
   knowledge, we may at least know all that it concerns us to know, as
   intelligent and responsible beings." [139]

   It has riot been left for Mr. Spencer to discover that, in the depths
   of His absolute Being, as well as in the plenitude of the modes of His
   revealed Being, there is that in God which must always pass our
   comprehension,--that in the present state of existence it is only very
   dimly and distantly, and by large use of "symbolic conceptions," that
   we can approximate to a right knowledge of God. This is affirmed in the
   Bible quite as strongly as it is by the agnostic philosophers. "Canst
   thou by searching find out God?" [140] "O the depth of the riches, both
   of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments,
   and His ways past finding out!" [141] "Now I know in part." [142] In
   this sense we cant speak of a Christian Agnosticism. [143] This
   incomprehensibility, however, is held in Scripture to arise, not from
   any inherent or incurable defect in the human faculties, but simply
   from the vastness of the object, in the knowledge of which,
   nevertheless, the mind may continually be growing. The universe itself
   in its immeasurable extent vastly transcends our present powers of
   knowledge . how much more the Author of the universe? This,
   accordingly, is not the point we have in dispute with Mr. Spencer. The
   point is not whether, in the depths of His absolute existence, there is
   much in God that must remain unknown to us; but whether He cannot be
   known by us in His revealed relations to ourselves, and to the world of
   which we form a part; whether these relations are not also in their
   measure a true expressions of His nature and character, so that through
   them we come to know something of Him, even of His absolute
   Being--though we cannot know all? When, now, the Agnostic tells us that
   knowledge of this kind is impossible to us, see in what contradiction
   he lands himself. Here is a man who says, "I know nothing of God; He is
   absolutely beyond my ken; I cannot form the faintest conception of what
   He is" And yet he knows so much about God as to be able to say
   beforehand that He cannot possibly enter into relations with human
   beings by which He might become known to them. This is a proposition of
   which the Agnostic, on his own showing, can never have any evidence. If
   God is unknowable, how can we know this much about Him--that He cannot
   in any mode or form enter into relations with us by which He might be
   known? Only on one supposition can this be maintained. If, indeed, as
   Mr. Spencer thinks, the nature of God and the intelligence of man are
   two things absolutely disparate--if, as Spinoza said, to speak of God
   taking on Him the nature of man is as absurd as to speak of a circle
   taking on it the nature of the square, [144] --then not only is God
   unknowable, but the whole Christian system is a priori ruled out of
   consideration. This, however, is a proposition which can never be
   proved, and we have seen that the attempt to prove and work with it
   only entangled Mr. Spencer in a mass of difficulties. There is really,
   on his own principles, no reason why he should not admit the
   possibility of a relative knowledge of God, as true in its way as the
   knowledge which we have of space, time, matter, force, or cause,--all
   which notions, as well as that of the Absolute, he tells us are
   prolific of intellectual contradictions. [145] Why, for instance,
   should we more hesitate to speak of God as Intelligence than to speak
   of Him as Power; why shrink from attributing to Him the attribute of
   Personality any more than that of Cause? [146] The whole objection,
   therefore, falls to the ground with the intellectual theory on which it
   is founded. For once grant that the nature of God and the intelligence
   of man are not thus foreign to each other, as Spencer supposes; grant
   that man is made in time image of God, and bears in some measure His
   likeness--then man's mind is not wholly shut up within the limits of
   the finite--there is an absolute element in it, kindred with the
   absolute reason of God, and real knowledge both of God and of the
   nature of things without us is possible.

    II. Positive evidence for the Christian view.

   II. The a priori bar with which Agnosticism would block the way to the
   knowledge of God being thus removed, we may proceed to inquire how it
   stands with the theistic postulate of the Christian view, in respect of
   the positive evidence in its behalf. It has been shown that, if the
   Christian view be true, it must, up to a certain point, admit of
   verification by reason. The doctrine of God's existence must be shown
   to be in accord with reason, and to be in harmony with amid
   corroborated by the facts of science and of the religious history of
   mankind. Science, indeed, has not for its object the determination of
   anything supernatural. Yet in its inquiries--dealing as it does with
   laws and forces, and with the widest generalisations of experience--it
   must come to a point at which the questions with which religion and
   philosophy deal are forced upon it, and it has to take up some attitude
   to them. The facts which it brings to light, the interpretations which
   it gives of these facts, cannot but have some bearing on the hypotheses
   we form as to the ultimate cause of existence. If it does not cross the
   borderland, it at least brings us within sight of truths which do not
   lie within its proper sphere, and points the way to their acceptance.

   1. I may begin with certain things in regard to which it is possible to
   claim a large measure of agreement. And--

   (1) It may be assumed with little fear of contradiction, that if the
   idea of God is to be entertained, it can only be in the form of
   Monotheism. The Agnostic will grant us this much. Whatever the power is
   which works in the universe, it is one. "As for Polytheism," says a
   writer in Lux Mundi, "it has ceased to exist in the civilised world.
   Every theist is, by a rational necessity, a monotheist." [147] The
   Christian assumption of the unity and absoluteness of God--of the
   dependence of the creamed universe upon Him--is thus confirmed. It is
   to be remembered that this truth, preached as a last result of science
   and of the philosophy of evolution, is a first truth of the Biblical
   religion. It is the Bible, and the Bible alone, which has made
   Monotheism the possession of the world. The unity of God was declared
   on the soil of Israel long before science or philosophy had the means
   of declaring it. [148] Through Christianity it has been made the
   possession of mankind. On the soil of paganism we see reason struggling
   towards this idea, striking out partial glimpses of it, sometimes
   making wonderful approximations to it, hut never in its own strength
   lifting itself clear away from Polytheism to the pure conception of the
   one spiritual God, such as we find it in Christianity, still less
   making this the foundation of a religion It is through Christianity,
   not through philosophical speculation, that this truth has become the
   support of faith, a light to which the investigations of science
   themselves owe much, and a sustaining principle and power in the lives
   of men. [149]

   (2) This Power which the evolutionist requires us to recognise as the
   origin of all things is the source of a rational order. This is a
   second fact about which there can be no dispute. There is a rational
   order and connection of things in the universe. Science is not only the
   means by which our knowledge of this order is extended, but it is
   itself a standing proof of the existence of this order. Science can
   only exist on the assumption that the world is not chaos, hut
   cosmos--that there is unity, order, law, in it--that it is a coherent
   and consistent whole of things, construable through our intelligence,
   and capable of being expressed in forms of human speech. And the more
   carefully we examine the universe, we find that this is really its
   character. It is an harmonious universe. There is orderly sequence in
   it. There is orderly connection of part and part. There is that
   determinable connection we call law. There is the harmonious adjustment
   of means to ends, which again are embraced in higher ends, till, in the
   nobler systems, the teleological idea is extended to the whole system.
   [150] In many ways does Mr. Spencer express in his writings his trust
   that this Power of which he speaks--inscrutable as he proclaims it to
   be--may be depended on not to put him, as the authors of the "Unseen
   Universe" phrase it, "to intellectual confusion." [151] To give only
   one instance--he bids the man who has some highest truth to speak, not
   to be afraid to speak it out, on the ground that "it is not for nothing
   that lie has in him these sympathies with some principles, and
   repugnance to others. . . . He, like every other man," he says, "may
   properly consider himself as one of the myriad agencies through whom
   works the Unknown Cause; and when the Unknown Cause produces in him a
   certain belief, he is thereby authorised to profess and act out that
   belief. For to render in their highest sense the words of the poet--


   Nature is made better by no mean,
   But Nature makes that mean; o'er that art
   Which roll cay adds to Nature, is an art Which
   Nature makes.'

   Not as adventitious, therefore, will the wise man regard the faith that
   is in him." [152] Who does not see in these remarkable sentences that,
   notwithstanding his reiteration of the words "Unknown Cause,"
   "Unknowable," Mr. Spencer's latent faith is that this Power which works
   in the world and in men is a Power working according to rational laws
   and for rational ends--is on this account an object of trust--we might
   almost add, a source of inspiration? But now, if this is so, can the
   conclusion be avoided that the Power on which we thus depend rationally
   is itself rational? It is knowable at least thins far, that we know
   that it is the source of a rational order--of an order construable
   through our intelligence. If now it is asserted that the source of this
   rational order is not itself rational, surely the proof rests, not on
   him who affirms, but on him who denies. [153] If Mr. Spencer replies,
   as he does reply, that it is an " erroneous assumption that the choice
   is between personality and something lower than personality, whereas
   the choice is rather between personality only something higher," amid
   asks--"Is it not just possible that there is a mode of being as much
   transcending intelligence and will, as these transcend mechanical
   motion?" [154] --the answer (not to dwell on the utterly disparate
   character of the things compare d) is ready--this higher mode of being
   cannot at least be less than conscious. It may be a higher kind of
   consciousness, but it cannot be higher than consciousness. Nor is there
   the slightest ground for the assumption that there can be anything
   higher than self-conscious intelligence or reason. [155] If we find in
   the universe an order congruous to the reason we have in ourselves,
   this is warranty sufficient for believing, till the contrary is proved,
   that the Power which gives rise to this order is not only Power, but
   Intelligence and Wisdom as well.

   (3) Again, this Power which the evolutionist compels us to recognise is
   the source of a moral order. Butler, in his Analogy, undertook to prove
   that the constitution and course of things are on the side of virtue.
   His argument is sometimes spoken of as obsolete, but it is not so much
   obsolete as simply transformed. It is a new-fashioned phrase which
   Matthew Arnold uses when lie speaks of a "Power not ourselves that
   makes for righteousness," but it means just what Butler meant, that the
   make and constitution of things in the universe are for righteousness,
   and not for its opposite. Right eons conduct works out good results for
   the individual and for society; vicious conduct works out bad results.
   But what I wish to point out at present is the new support which this
   view receives from the theory of agnostic evolution, which is supposed
   by many to overthrow it. No philosophy, which aims at completeness, can
   avoid the obligation resting on it of showing that it is capable of
   yielding a coherent theory of human life. The construction of a system
   of ethics, therefore, Mr. Spencer justly regards as that part of his
   work to which all the other parts are subsidiary. The theological basis
   of ethics is rejected; utilitarianism also is set aside as inadequate;
   and in room of these the attempt is made to establish the rules of
   right conduct on a scientific basis by deducing them from the general
   laws of evolution. You find a Power evolving itself in the universe.
   Study, says Mr. Spencer, the laws of its evolution: find "the naturally
   revealed end towards which the Power manifested throughout evolution
   works"; then, "since evolution has been, and is still, working towards
   the highest life, it follows that conforming to these principles by
   which the higher life is achieved, is furthering that end." [156] And
   when a system us constructed on this basis, what is the result? Why,
   that we are simply back to the old morality-to what Mr. Spencer himself
   calls "a rationalised version of the ethical principles" of the current
   creed. [157] The ethical laws which are deduced from the observations
   of the laws of evolution are identical with those which Christian
   ethics and the natural conscience of man in the higher stages of its
   development have always recognised. [158] What is the inference? These
   principles were not originally gained by scientific induction. They
   were the expressions of the natural consciousness of mankind as to
   distinctions of right and wrong, or were promulgated by teachers who
   claimed to have received them from a higher source. In either case,
   they were recognised by man as principles independently affirmed by
   conscience to be right. And now that the process of evolution comes to
   be scientifically studied, we are told that the principles of conduct
   yielded by it, in light of the end to which evolution naturally works,
   absolutely coincide with those which spring from this "work of the law"
   written in men's hearts. What else can we conclude, assuming that the
   evolutionist is right in his deduction, but that the universe is
   constructed in harmony with right; that the laws which we have already
   recognised as of binding authority in conscience are also laws of the
   objective world; that the principles of right discovered in conscience,
   and the moral order of society based on these principles, are
   productions of the one great evolutionary cause, which is the Force
   impelling and controlling the whole onward movement of humanity? There
   is certainly nothing lucre to conflict with, but everything to support
   the view that the Power which is above all, and through all, and in all
   things, is not only Intelligence and Wisdom, but also an Ethical Will.
   At least, to most persons who dispassionately study the subject, I
   think it will appear reasonable that a Power which has an ethical end
   must be an ethical Power. If, further, this ethical end embraces, as
   Mr. Spencer seems to believe, the highest perfection amid happiness of
   man, [159] it is still more difficult to conceive how it should have a
   place in the nature of things unless the Supreme Power were itself
   benevolent and good. It is not, it should be remembered, as if this
   ethical end were an after-thought or accident. It is, according to the
   theory, the final and supreme goad to which the whole process of
   evolution for count- less millenniums has been working up, and only
   when it is reached will the ripest fruit of the whole development be
   gathered. But how is this possible, except on a teleological view of
   things; and what teleology can yield a moral result which does not
   postulate at the other end a moral cause? Mr. Spencer may deprecate as
   he will the imposing of moral ideas generated in our consciousness upon
   the Infinite which transcends consciousness. But it is only his own
   arbitrary denial of consciousness to the Absolute, and his arbitrary
   assumption that there can be no kindredship between that absolute
   consciousness and our own, which prevents him from drawing the natural
   conclusion from his own premises. But if to Mr. Spencer's definition of
   the Absolute, as "an Infinite and Eternal Energy from which all things
   proceed," we add, as I think we are entitled to do, the predicates of
   infinite Intelligence and of Wisdom, and of Ethical Will, we have all
   the fundamental theistic positions affirmed.

   If the First Cause of the universe is proved by its manifestations to
   be at once rational Intelligence and Ethical Will, there should be no
   excess of scrupulosity in applying to it the term "Personal." I have
   thus far reasoned on the assumptions of Mr. Spencer, and have spoken of
   his Ultimate Reality as he does himself, as "Power," "Force," "Cause,"
   etc. But I cannot leave this part of the subject without remarking that
   Mr. Spencer is far from having the field of thought all to himself on
   this question of the nature of the Ultimate Existence. It was shown in
   last Lecture how, starting from a different point of view, the higher
   philosophy of the century--the Neo-Kantian and Neo-Hegelian--reaches,
   with a very large degree of certainty, the conclusion that the ultimate
   principle of the universe must be self-conscious. It is well known that
   the Personality of God was a point left in very great doubt in the
   system of Hegel. [160] God was conceived of as the Absolute Reason, but
   the drift of the system seemed to point rather to an impersonal Reason
   which first becomes conscious of itself ill man, than to a
   selfconsciousness complete and perfect from the beginning. Whatever its
   other defects, the later Hegelianism has shaken itself clear of this
   ambiguity, amid affirms with emphasis that the principle at the basis
   of the universe is self-conscious. [161] The other line of
   development--the Neo-Kantian--is, in the person of its chief
   representative, Hermann Lotze, explicitly theistic. I only notice here,
   that after a careful discussion of all the arguments against ascribing
   Personality to time Divine Being, on the ground that personality
   implies the limitation of the finite, Lotze arrives at this conclusion,
   diametrically the opposite of Mr. Spencer's--"Perfect personality is
   reconcilable only with the conception of an infinite Being; for finite
   beings only an approximation to this is attainable." [162] It is
   interesting, further, to notice that even Neo-Spencerianism--if I may
   coin such a term--has come round, in tire person of Mr. Fiske, to a
   similar affirmation. "The final conclusion," he says, "is, that we must
   not say that God is Force,' since such a phrase inevitably calls up
   those pantheistic notions of blind necessity, which it is my express
   desire to avoid; but always bearing in mind the symbolic character of
   the words, we may say that God is Spirit.' How my belief in the
   personality of God could be more strongly affirmed without entirely
   deserting the language of modern philosophy and taking refuge in pure
   mythology, I am unable to see." [163]

   2. It is now necessary to come to closer quarters, arid to ask whether
   the ordinary proofs for the existence of God, which have been so much
   assailed since the time of Kant, still retain their old cogency, arid
   if not, what modifications require to be made on them. The
   time-honoured division of these proofs--which have recently received so
   able a re-handling at the instance of Dr. Hutchison Stirling in his
   "Gifford Lectures"--is into the cosmological, the teleological, and the
   ontological, to which, as belonging to another category, falls to be
   added the moral. Besides these, Kant thinks, there are no others. [164]
   This, however, must be taken with qualification, if the remark is meant
   to apply to the old scholastic forms in which these proofs have
   customarily been put. Not only is there no necessity for the proofs
   being confined to these forms--some of which are clearly
   inadequate--hut they are capable of many extensions, and even
   transformations, as the result of advancing knowledge, and of the
   better insight of reason into its own nature. I may add that I do not
   attach much importance in this connection to objections to these proofs
   drawn from Kant's peculiar theory of knowledge. [165] If it can be
   shown that in the exercise of our reason as directed on the world in
   which we live--or on its own nature--we are compelled either to cease
   to think, or to think in a particular way,--if we find that these
   necessities of thought are not peculiar to individuals here and there,
   but have been felt by the soundest thinkers in all ages, and among
   peoples widely separated from each other,--we may be justified in
   believing that our reason is not altogether an untrustworthy guide, but
   may be depended on with considerable confidence to direct us to the
   truth.

   Neither shall I waste time at this stage by discussing in what sense it
   is permissible to speak of "proof" of so transcendent a reality as the
   Divine existence. We remember here the saying of Jacobi, that a God
   capable of proof would be no God at all; since this would mean that
   there is something higher than God from which His existence can be
   deduced. But this applies only to the ordinary reasoning of the
   deductive logic. It does not apply to that higher kind of proof which
   may be said to consist in the mind being guided back to the clear
   recognition of its own ultimate pre-suppositions. Proof in Theism
   certainly does not consist in deducing God's existence as a lower from
   a higher; but rather in showing that God's existence is itself the last
   postulate of reason--the ultimate basis on which all other knowledge,
   all other belief rests. What we mean by proof of God's existence is
   simply that there are necessary acts of thought by which we rise from
   the finite to the infinite, from the caused to the uncaused, from the
   contingent to the necessary, from the reason involved in the structure
   of the universe to a universal and eternal Reason, which is the ground
   of all, from morality in conscience to a moral Lawgiver and Judge. In
   this connection the three theoretical proofs constitute an inseparable
   unity--"constitute together," as Dr. Stirling finely declares, "but the
   three undulations of a single wave, which wave is but a natural rise
   and ascent to God, on the part of man s own thought, with man's own
   experience and consciousness as the object before him." [166]

   (1) The cosmological argument.

   (1) Adopting the usual arrangement, I speak first of the cosmological
   proof, which, from the contingency and mutability of the world,--from
   its finite, dependent, changeful, multiple character,--concludes to an
   infinite and necessary Being as its ground and cause. That this
   movement of thought is necessary is shown by the whole history of
   philosophy and religion. Kant, who subjects the argument to a severe
   criticism, nevertheless admits--"It is something very remarkable that,
   on the supposition that something exists, I cannot avoid the inference
   that something exists necessarily." [167] The question then arises--Is
   the world this necessary Being? The cosmological proof on its various
   sides is directed to showing that it is not,--that it is not sufficient
   for its own explanation,--that, therefore, it must have its ground and
   origin in some other being that is necessary. Whatever exists has
   either the reason of its existence in itself, or has it in something
   else. But that the world has not the reason of its existence in
   itself--is not, in Spinoza's phrase, causa sui, is not a necessarily
   existing being--is shown in various ways.

   i. By the contingency of its existence.--A necessary Being as Kant
   himself defines it, is one the necessity of whose existence is given
   through its possibility, i.e. the non-existence of which cannot be
   thought of as possible. [168] But the world is not an existence of this
   character. We can think of its non-existence without contradiction--as,
   e.g., we cannot think of the non-existence of space and time. We think
   away all the contents of space and time, but we cannot think away space
   and time themselves.

   ii. By the dependency of its several parts.--It is made up of finite
   parts, each of which is dependent on the others, and sustains definite
   relations to them; its parts, therefore, have not the character of
   self-subsistence. But a world made up of parts, none of which is
   self-subsistent, cannot as a whole be self-subsistent, or the necessary
   Being. [169]

   iii. By its temporal succession of effects.--The world is in constant
   flux and change. Causes give birth to effects, and effects depend on
   causes. Each state into which it passes has determining conditions in
   some immediately preceding state. This fact, apart from the general
   proof of contingency, suggests the need of conceiving not only of a
   necessary ground, but likewise of a First Cause of the universe. The
   alternative supposition is that of an eternal series of causes and
   effects--a conception which is unthinkable, and affords no
   resting-place for reason. What can be more self-contradictory than the
   hypothesis of a chain of causes and effects, each link of which hangs
   on a preceding link, while yet the whole chain hangs on nothing? [170]
   Reason, therefore, itself points us to the need of a First Cause of the
   universe, who is at the same time a self-existing, necessary, infinite
   Being.

   It is, since Kant's time, customarily made an objection to this
   argument, that it only takes us as far as some necessary being--it does
   not show us in the least degree what kind of a being this is--whether,
   e.g., in the world or out of it, whether the world soul of the Stoics,
   the pantheistic substance of Spinoza, the impersonal reason of Hegel,
   or the personal God of the theist. This may be, and therefore the
   cosmological argument may need the other arguments to complete it. It
   will be found, however, when we go more deeply (in the ontological
   argument) into the conception of necessary being, that there is only
   one kind of existence which answers to this description, and with this
   more perfect conception the cosmological argument will then connect
   itself.

   As thus presented, the cosmological argument is a process of thought. I
   cannot leave it, however, without pointing out that it stands connected
   with a direct fact of consciousness, which, as entering into
   experience, changes this proof to some extent from a merely logical
   into a real one. Not to speak of the immediate impression of
   transitoriness, finitude, contingency, vanity, which, prior to all
   reasoning, one receives from the world, [171] and which finds
   expression, more or less, in all religions, there is, at the very root
   of our religious consciousness, that "feeling of absolute dependence"
   which Schleiermacher fixes on as the very essence of religion: [172]
   and which reappears in Mr. Spencer's philosophy in a changed form as
   the immediate consciousness of an absolute Power on which we and our
   universe alike depend. This feeling of dependence, so natural to man,
   and interweaving itself with all his religious experiences, is the
   counterpart in the practical sphere of the cosmological argument in the
   logical. Both need their explanation in something deeper than
   themselves, namely, in the possession by man of a rational nature,
   which makes him capable of rising in thought and feeling above the
   finite. And as, in the theoretic sphere, the cosmological argument
   presses forward to its completion in another and a higher, so in the
   religious sphere the rational nature of man forbids that this sense of
   dependence should remain a mere feeling of dependency on a blind Power.
   Religion must free, bless, inspire, strengthen men. From the first,
   therefore, the soul is at work, seeking in its depths, and in obedience
   to its own laws, to change this relation of dependence into a free and
   personal one.

   (2) The second argument for the Divine existence is the
   teleological,--better known simply as the design argument. Kant speaks
   of this oldest and most popular of the theistic arguments with great
   respect; and the objections which he makes to it affect more its
   adequacy to do all that is expected from it than its force so far as it
   goes. It does not, he thinks, prove a Creator, but only an Architect,
   of the world; it does not prove an infinite, but only a very great
   Intelligence, etc. [173] I may remark, however, that if it proves even
   this, it does a great deal; and from an intelligence so great as to
   hold in its ken the plan and direction of the universe, the step will
   not be found a great one to the Infinite Intelligence which we call
   God. But the argument, in the right conception of it, does more than
   Kant allows, and is a step of transition to the final one--the
   ontological.

   A new argument against design in nature has been found in recent times
   in the doctrine of evolution. The proof we are considering turns, as
   every one knows, on the existence of ends in nature. In Kant's words:
   "In the world we find everywhere clear signs of an order which can only
   spring from design--an order realised with the greatest wisdom, and in
   a universe which is indescribably varied in content, and in extent
   infinite." [174] In organisms particularly we see the most
   extraordinary adaptations of means to ends--structures of almost
   infinite complexity and wonderful perfection--contrivances in which we
   have precisely the same evidence of the adjustment of the parts to
   produce the ends as in human works of art. [175] From this the
   inference is drawn, that a world so full of evidences of rational
   purpose can only be the work of a wise and intelligent mind. But this
   argument is broken down if it can be shown that what look like ends in
   nature are not really such, but simply results--that the appearance of
   apparently designed arrangements to produce certain ends can be
   explained by the action of causes which do not imply intelligence. This
   is what evolution, in the hands of some of its expounders, undertakes
   to do. By showing how structures may have arisen through natural
   selection, operating to the preservation of favourable variations in
   the struggle for existence, it is thought that the aid of intelligence
   may be dispensed with, and that a deathblow is given to teleology.
   [176] The eye, for example, may have resulted from the gradual
   accumulation of small variations, each of them accidental, and arising
   from unknown laws in the organism, but each, as it arises giving to its
   possessor some slight advantage in the struggle for existence. It is a
   simple case of the survival of the fittest. Instead of the advantage
   resulting from a designed arrangement, the appearance of arrangement
   results from the advantage. In reality, the facts of evolution do not
   weaken the proof from design, but rather immensely enlarge it by
   showing all things to be bound together in a vaster, grander plan than
   had been formerly conceived. Let us see how the matter precisely
   stands.

   On the general hypothesis of evolution, as applied to the organic
   world, I have nothing to say, except that, within certain limits, it
   seems to me extremely probable, and supported by a large body of
   evidence. This, however, only refers to the fact of a genetic
   relationship of some kind between the different species of plants and
   animals, and does not affect the means by which this development may be
   supposed to be brought about. On this subject two views may be held.
   [177] The first is that evolution results from development from within;
   in which case, obviously, the argument from design stands precisely
   where it did, except that the sphere of its application is enormously
   extended. The second view is, that evolution has resulted from
   fortuitous variations, combined with action of natural selection,
   laying hold of and preserving the variations that were favourable. This
   is really, under a veil of words, to ask us to believe that accident
   and fortuity have done the work of mind. But the facts are not in
   agreement with the hypothesis. The variations in organisms are net
   absolutely indefinite. In the evolution of an eye, for example, the
   variations are all more or less in the line of producing the eye. When
   the formation of an eye has begun, the organism keeps to that line in
   that place. It does not begin to sprout an ear where the eye is being
   developed. There is a ground plan that is adhered to in the midst of
   the variations. Could we collect the successive forms through which the
   eye is supposed to have passed in the course of its development, what
   we would see (I speak on the hypothesis of the theory) would be a
   succession of small increments of structure, all tending in the
   direction of greater complexity and perfection of the organ--the
   appearance of new muscles, new lenses, new arrangements for adjusting
   or perfecting the sight, etc. But the mere fact that these successive
   appearances could be put in a line, however extended, would throw no
   light on how the development took place, or how this marvellously
   complex organ came to build itself up precisely after this pattern.
   [178] The cause invoked to explain this is natural selection. Now the
   action of natural selection is real, but its influence may be very
   easily overrated. It is never to be forgotten that natural selection
   produces nothing. It acts only on organisms already produced, weeding
   out the weakest, and the least fitted structurally to survive, and
   heaving the better adapted in possession of the field. [179] It is
   altogether to exaggerate the influence of natural selection, to
   attribute to it a power to pick out infallibly on the first appearance
   the infinitesimal variations in an organism which are to form the
   foundations of future useful organs, though, in their initial stage,
   they cannot be shown to confer any benefit on their possessors, and may
   be balanced or neutralised by fifty or sixty other variations in an
   opposite direction, or by differences of size, strength, speed, etc.,
   on the part of the competitors in the struggle; and still more a power
   to preserve each of these slight variations till another and yet
   another of a favourable kind is added to it after long intervals, in a
   contest in which numbers alone are overwhelmingly against the chance of
   its survival. [180] Taking the facts of evolution as they really stand,
   what they seem to point to is something hike the following:--

   i. An inner power of development of organisms.

   ii. A power of adjustment in organisms adapting them to environment.

   iii. A weeding out of weak and unfit organisms by natural selection.

   iv. Great differences in the rate of production of new species.
   Ordinarily, species seem to have nearly all the characters of fixity
   which the old view ascribed to them. Variation exists, but it is
   confined within comparatively narrow limits. The type persists through
   ages practically unchanged. At other periods in the geological history
   of the past there seems to be a breaking down of this fixity. The
   history of life is marked by a great inrush of new forms. New species
   crowd upon the scene. Plasticity seems the order of the day. [181] We
   may call this evolution if we like, but it is none the less
   creation,--the production out of the old of something new and higher.
   All that we are called upon to notice here is that it in no way
   conflicts with design, but rather compels the acknowledgment of it.

   The chief criticism I would be disposed to make upon the design
   argument, as an argument for intelligence in the cause of the universe,
   is that it is too narrow. It confines the argument to final
   causes--that is, to the particular case of the adaptation of means to
   ends. But the basis for the inference that the universe has a wise and
   intelligent Author is far wider than this. It is not the marks of
   purpose alone which necessitate this inference, but everything which
   bespeaks order, plan, arrangement, harmony, beauty, rationality in the
   connection and system of things. It is the proof of the presence of
   thought in the world--whatever shape that may take. [182] As we saw in
   a former part of the Lecture, the assumption on which the whole of
   science proceeds--and cannot but proceed--in its investigations is,
   that the system it is studying is intelligible,--that there is an
   intelligible unity of things. It admits of being reduced to terms of
   thought. There is a settled and established order on which the
   investigator can depend. Without this he could not advance one step.
   Even Kant's objection, that this argument proved only an architect of
   the universe, but not a creator of its materials, is seen from this
   point of view to be invalid. [183] The very materials of the
   universe--the atoms which compose it--show by their structure, their
   uniformity, their properties, their mathematical relations, that they
   must have a Creator; that the Power which originated them, which
   weighed, measured, and numbered them, which stamped on them their
   common characters, and gave them their definite laws and relations,
   must have been intelligent. I admit, however, that as the design
   argument presupposes the cosmological, to give us the idea of an
   infinite and necessary Being at the basis of the universe, so both of
   these arguments need the ontological, to show us in the clearest and
   most convincing manner that this Being and Cause of the universe is
   infinite, self conscious Reason.

   (3) I come, accordingly, in the third place, to the ontological
   argument--that which Kant, not without reason, affirms to beat the
   foundation of the other two, and to be the real ground on which the
   inference to the existence of a necessary and infinitely perfect Being
   rests. It is an argument which in these days, owing largely to his
   criticism upon it, has fallen much into disrepute, though a good deal
   has also been done by able thinkers to rehabilitate it, and to show its
   real bearings. It must further be admitted that in the form in which it
   was wont to be put in the schools, the strictures which Kant makes on
   it are in the main just.1 [184] In the earlier form, it is an argument
   from the idea of God as a necessary idea of the mind, to His real
   existence. I have, reasons Anselm, the idea of a most perfect Being.
   But this idea includes the attribute of existence. For if the most
   perfect Being did not exist, there could be conceived a greater than
   He,--one that did exist,--and therefore He would not be the most
   perfect. The most perfect Being, therefore, is one in the idea of whom
   existence is necessarily included. In this form the argument seems
   little better than a logical quibble, and so Kant has treated it. Kant
   grants the necessity of the idea--shows how it arises--names it The
   Ideal of Pure Reason--but argues with cogency that from an idea, purely
   as such, you cannot conclude to real existence. It would be strange,
   however, if an argument which has wielded such power over some of the
   strongest intellects were utterly baseless; and Dr. Hutchison Stirling
   has well shown that when we get to the kernel of Anselm's thought, as
   he himself explains it, it has by no means the irrational character
   which might at first sight appear to belong to it. [185] Anselm's form
   of the argument, however, it must now be observed, is neither the final
   nor the perfect one. Kant himself has given the impulse to a new
   development of it, which shows more clearly than ever that it is not
   baseless, but is really the deepest and most comprehensive of all
   arguments--the argument implied in both of the two preceding.

   The kernel of the ontological argument, as we find it put, for example,
   by Prof. Green, is the assertion that thought is the necessary prius of
   all else that is--even of all possible or conceivable existence. This
   assertion is not arrived at in any a priori way, but by the strict and
   sober analysis of what is involved in such knowledge of existence as we
   have. If we analyse the act of knowledge, we find that in every form of
   it there are implied certain necessary and universal conditions, which,
   from the nature of the case, must be conditions of experience also,
   otherwise it could never be experience for us at all. Thus, any world
   we are capable of knowing with our present faculties must be a world in
   space and time,--a world subject to conditions of number and
   quantity,--a world apprehended in relations of substance and accident,
   cause and effect, etc. A world of any other kind--supposing it to
   exist--would be in relation to our thought or knowledge unthinkable.
   These conditions of knowledge, moreover, are not arbitrary and
   contingent, but universal and necessary. They spring from reason
   itself, and express its essential and immutable nature. Thus we feel
   sure that there is no world in space or time to which the laws of
   mathematics do not apply; no world possible in which events do not
   follow each other according to the law of cause and effect; no world in
   which the fundamental laws of thought and reasoning are different from
   what they are in our own. Mr. J. S. Mill, indeed, thought there might
   be worlds in which two and two do not make four; or in which events
   succeed each other without any causal relation. But in this he will get
   few to agree with him. In like manner, there are moral principles which
   our reason recognises as universally and unconditionally valid. We
   cannot conceive of a world in which falsehood would really be a virtue,
   and truth-speaking a vice. We hold it, therefore, for certain that
   reason is the source of universal and necessary principles which spring
   from its essence, and which are the conditions of all possible
   knowledge. But this, its own essential nature, reason finds reflected
   back from the world around it. A world does exist, constituted through
   these very principles which we find within ourselves,--in space and
   time, through number and quantity, substance and quality, cause and
   effect, etc.,--and therefore knowable by us, and capable of becoming an
   object of our experience. We arrive, therefore, at this--that the world
   is constituted through a reason similar to our own; that, in Mr.
   Green's words, "the understanding which presents an order of nature to
   us is in principle one with an understanding which constitutes that
   order itself." [186] And that such a reason not only does, but must
   exist, I see not simply by inference from the existence of the world,
   which is the higher form of the cosmological argument, but by
   reflection on the necessary character of the principles of reason
   themselves. For whence these laws of thought--these universal and
   necessary conditions of all truth and knowledge--which I discover in
   myself; which my own reason neither makes nor can unmake; which I
   recognise to be in me and yet not of me; which I know must belong to
   every rational being in every part of the universe? They are necessary
   and eternal in their nature, yet they have not the ground of their
   existence in my individual mind. Can I conclude otherwise than that
   they have their seat and ground in an eternal and absolute Reason--the
   absolute Prius of all that is, at once of thought and of existence? It
   is but a further extension of the same argument when I proceed to show
   that thought is only possible in relation to an I, to a central
   principle of self-consciousness, which unifies and connects all
   thinking and experience.

   This argument, which has been called that of "Rational Realism," is one
   which in varied forms has been accepted by the deepest thinkers, and
   finds widespread acknowledgment in literature. [187] It is not liable
   to the objection made to the Anselmic form, of involving an illicit
   inference from mere idea to real existence; but it has this in common
   with it, that the existence of an Eternal Reason is shown to be
   involved in the very thinking of this, or indeed of any thought. In the
   very act of thinking, thought affirms its own existence. But thought
   can perceive, not only its own existence, but the necessity of its
   existence--the necessity of its existence, even, as the prius of
   everything else. What is affirmed, therefore, is not simply my thought,
   but an Absolute Thought, and with this the existence of an Absolute
   Thinker; in the words of Dr. Harris, who has done much to give popular
   expression to this argument, of "an Absolute Reason energising in
   perfect wisdom and love" in the universe. [188] I cannot but maintain,
   therefore, that the onto- logical argument, in the kernel and essence
   of it, is a sound one, and that in it the existence of God is really
   seen to be the first, the most certain, and the most indisputable of
   all truths.

   We saw in connection with the cosmological argument that there was a
   direct fact of consciousness which turned the logical argument into a
   real one,--which translated, if I may so speak, the abstract proof into
   a living experience. It is worth our while to inquire, before leaving
   these theoretic proofs, whether there is anything of the same kind
   here; anything in actual religious consciousness which answers to that
   demonstration of a rational element in the world which is given in the
   two remaining arguments. I think there is. I refer to that very real
   perception which mankind have at all times manifested of a spiritual
   presence and power in nature, which is the effect of the total
   unanalysed impression which nature in its infinite variety and
   complexity, its wondrous grandeur, order, beauty, and fulness of life
   and power, makes upon the soul. The more carefully facts have been
   examined, the more narrowly the history of religions has been
   scrutinised, the clearer has it become that underlying all the
   particular ideas men have of their deities,--underlying their
   particular acts of worship to them,--there is always this sense of
   something mysterious, intangible, infinite--of an all-pervading
   supernatural Presence and Power,--which is not identified with any of
   the particular phenomena of nature, but is regarded rather as
   manifested through them. [189] It is this which Paul speaks of when he
   says that "the Eternal Power and Divinity" of God are manifested since
   the creation of the world in the things that are made. [190] It is Max
   Muller's "perception of the infinite," Schleiermacher's "consciousness
   of the infinite in the finite," the sensus numinis of the older
   writers, Wordsworth's "sense of something far more deeply interfused"--

   "Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean, and
   the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man." [191]

   Such a sense or perception of the Divine is the common sub- stratum of
   all religions, and the theory of religion which fails to take account
   of it is hike the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out.

   But how is this sense of the Divine in nature--which is the stronghold
   of the theology of feeling--to be accounted for? It is certainly not
   the result of logical argument, and goes beyond anything that logical
   argument could yield. Yet it may easily be shown that rational elements
   are implicit in it, and that the rational elements involved are
   precisely those which the fore going arguments have sought explicitly
   to unfold. To understand the impression of the Divine which nature
   makes on man, we have to remember how much the mind of man has already
   to do with nature. We have to do here with nature, not primarily as an
   objectively existing system of laws and forces, but as it exists for
   man as an object of actual knowledge and experience. And how has it
   come to be this to him? Not without help from the thinking mind which
   collates and connects the separate impressions made on it through the
   senses, and gradually reads the riddle of the universe by the help of
   what it brings to it out of its own resources. We speak of the
   immaturity of the savage mind, but there is an intense mental activity
   in the simplest conception which the savage (or the child) can form of
   the existence of nature, or of a world around him. He sees changes, but
   he finds the interpretation of these changes in the idea of causality
   which he brings to it from his own mind. He groups attributes and forms
   objects, but he does this through the mental law of substance and
   accident. He perceives the operation of vast forces in nature, but
   whence does he get the idea of force? He gets it from the consciousness
   of power within himself, and through this puts meaning into the scene
   of change and movement which he finds around him. Is it wonderful,
   then, that man, who has put so much of himself into nature, even when
   constructing it as an object of thought, should again receive back the
   reflection of his own spiritual image from nature--receive it back on a
   grander, vastly enhanced scale, proportionate to the greatness and
   immensity of the universe on which he looks, and should be filled with
   awe and reverence in presence of this Other-Self, and Higher-than-Self,
   as that of a Reason, Power, and Will essentially akin to his own,
   though infinitely greater? Reason does not create this sense of the
   Divine; it can only follow in its train, and seek to lay bare and
   analyse--as is done in the theoretic proofs--the rational elements
   which it involves.

    III. The moral argument--contrast with theoretic proofs.

   III. There remains the moral argument, which deserves a place by
   itself, and which I must briefly consider before I close. The theoretic
   proofs, as Kant rightly said, can give us no knowledge of God as a
   moral Being--as a Being who sets before Him moral ends, and governs the
   world with reference to these ends. For this we are dependent on the
   Practical Reason, which shows us not what is, but what ought to be, and
   is the source of laws of moral conduct which we recognise as of binding
   force for every rational agent. The way in which Kant works out his
   argument from this point is one of the most interesting parts of his
   system. Nature in itself, he thinks, knows nothing of a highest end.
   This is given only in the Practical Reason, which sets before us ends
   of unconditioned worth, and requires us, if our view of the world is to
   be consistent, to regard these as supreme, i.e. to view the world as a
   moral system, in which natural ends are everywhere subordinated to
   moral. But such a moral teleology is only possible if there is one
   principle of the natural and of the moral order, and if nature is so
   arranged as to secure a final harmony of natural and moral conditions;
   in other words, if the world has a moral as well as an intelligent
   cause. God, therefore, is a postulate of the Practical Reason. [192] I
   quote, in further illustration of this argument, Professor Caird's
   fuller statement of it, in his excellent exposition of the Critique of
   Judgment, in which he follows Kant. "The principle of moral
   determination in man," he says, "carries with it the idea of a highest
   end, after which he should strive; in other words, the idea of a system
   in which all rational beings realise their happiness through their
   moral perfection, and in proportion to it. But such realisation of
   happiness through morality is no natural sequence of effect on cause;
   for there is nothing in the connection of physical causes that has any
   relation to such an end. We are forced, therefore, by the same moral
   necessity which makes us set before us such an end, to postulate
   outside of nature a cause that determines nature, so as finally to
   secure this result: and from this follows necessarily the idea of an
   all-wise, all-powerful, all-righteous, all-merciful God. We have a pure
   moral need' for the existence of such a Being; and our moral needs
   differ from physical needs in that they have an absolute claim to
   satisfaction. . . . Furthermore, we are to remember that the principle
   which leads us to postulate God is a practical principle, which does
   not give us, strictly speaking, a knowledge of God, but only of a
   special relation in which He stands to us and to nature: while,
   therefore, in order to find in God the principle which realises the
   highest good, we are obliged to represent Him as a rational Being, who
   is guided by the idea of an end, and who uses nature as means to it, we
   are to remember that this conception is based on an imperfect analogy.
   . . . All that we can say is that, consistently with the nature of our
   intelligence, we cannot make intelligible to ourselves the possibility
   of such an adaptation of nature to the moral law and its object as is
   involved in the final end which the moral law commands us to aim at,
   except by assuming the existence of a Creator and Governor of the
   world, who is also its moral Legislator.'" [193]

   It is to this view of God as a postulate of the Practical Reason, and
   as satisfying a "pure moral need," that the Ritschlian theology
   specially attaches itself; but-it must be remarked that such an origin
   of the idea of God, abstracted from direct experience of dependence on
   Him, would furnish no adequate explanation of the religious relation.
   We may, however, accept all that Kant says of God as a postulate of the
   moral consciousness, and yet carry the argument a good deal further
   than he does. God is not only a postulate of the moral nature in the
   sense that His existence is necessary to secure the final harmony of
   natural and moral conditions, but it may be held that His existence is
   implied in the very presence of a morally legislating and commanding
   Reason within us,--just as an eternal self-conscious Reason was seen to
   be implied in the universal and necessary principles of the theoretic
   consciousness. That moral law which appears in conscience--the
   "categorical imperative" of duty for which Kant himself has done so
   much to intensify our reverence --that ideal of unrealised goodness
   which hovers constantly above us, awakening in us a noble
   dissatisfaction with all past attainments,--these are not facts which
   explain themselves. Nor are they sufficiently explained as products of
   association and of social convention. Moral law is not comprehensible
   except as the expression of a will entitled to impose its commands upon
   us. The rules and ideals of conduct which conscience reveals to us, and
   which bind the will with such unconditional authority, point to a
   deeper source in an eternal moral Reason. The ethical ideal, if its
   absolute character is to be secured, points back to an eternal ground
   in the Absolute Being. It takes us back to the same conception of God
   as the ethically perfect Being, source and ground of moral truth
   fountain of moral law, which we found to be implied in Christianity.
   [194]

   And let me observe, finally, that here also we have more than logical
   argument--we have experience. The moral consciousness is one of the
   most powerful direct sources of man's knowledge of God. In the earliest
   stages in which we know anything about man, a moral element blends with
   his thought. There grows up within him--he knows not how--a sense of
   right and wrong, of a law making its presence felt in his life,
   prescribing to him moral duties, and speaking to him with a "thou
   shalt" and "thou shalt not" in his soul which he dare not disregard.
   His thoughts, meanwhile, accuse or else excuse each other. This law,
   moreover, presents itself to him as something more than a mere idea of
   his own mind. It is a real judging power in his soul, an arbiter
   invested with legislative, but also with judicial functions. It has
   accordingly from the first a sacred character. It is a power not
   himself making for righteousness within him. He instinctively connects
   it with the Power be worships, whose existence is borne in on him from
   other sources. As conscience develops, his deities come to be more
   invested with a moral character, and are feared, honoured, or
   propitiated accordingly. It is the moral consciousness particularly
   which safeguards the personality of God--the Divine tending to sink
   back into identity with nature in proportion as the ethical idea is
   obscured.

   The conclusion we reach from the various arguments and considerations
   advanced in this Lecture is, that the Christian view of a personal and
   holy God, as the Author of the universe, and its moral Legislator and
   Ruler, is the only one in which the reason and the heart of man can
   permanently rest. I do not say that reason could have reached the
   height of the Christian conception for itself; I do not even think it
   can hold to it unless it accepts the fact of Revelation and the other
   truths which Christianity associates with it. But I do say that, with
   this view as given, reason is able to bring to it abundant
   corroboration and verification. It is not one line of evidence only
   which establishes the theistic position, but the concurrent force of
   many,- starting from different and independent standpoints. And the
   voice of reason is confirmed by the soul's direct experiences in
   religion . At the very least these considerations show--even if the
   force of demonstration is denied to them--that the Christian view of
   God is not unreasonable; that it is in accordance with the highest
   suggestions of reason applied to the facts of existence; that there is
   no bar in rational thought or in science to its full acceptance. And
   this is all that at present we need ask.

   a method, tins essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a
   single principle. . . . Positively, the principle may be thus
   expressed: in matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it
   will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And,
   negatively, in matters of the intellect, do not pretend that
   conclusions are certain which are ant demonstrated or demonstrable.
   That I take to be the Agnostic faith, which, if a man keep whole and
   undefiled, he shall not be ashamed to look the universe in the face,
   whatever the future may have in store for him."--"Agnosticism," in
   Nineteenth Century, Feb. 1889. This, however, us evidently not a
   "faith," but, as he says, a "method," which in its application may
   yield positive or negative results, as the ease may be. Behind it, at
   the same time, lies, in his ease, the conviction that real answers to
   the greater questions of religions are "not merely actually impossible,
   but theoretically inconceivable."--Ibid. p. 182.

   Relative itself disappears, if our conception of the Absolute is a pure
   negation. . . . What, then, becomes of the assertion that the Absolute
   is conceived merely by a negation of conceivability,' or as the mere
   absence of the conditions under which consciousness is possible'? If
   the Non-relative or Absolute is present in thought only as a mere
   negation, then the relation between it and the Relative becomes
   unthinkable, because one of the terms of the relation is absent from
   consciousness. And if this relation is unthinkable, then is the
   Relative itself unthinkable, for want of its antithesis; whence results
   the disappearance of all thought whatever."--P. 91.

   of this Energy"; maintains that, instead of being an Everlasting No,
   Agnosticism is "an Everlasting Yea". denies that Agnosticism is
   "anything more than silent with respect to personality," seeing that
   "duty requires us neither to affirm nor deny personality"; holds that
   the Unknowable is not an "All nothingness" but the "All- Being,"
   reiterates that this Reality "stands towards the universe and towards
   ourselves in the same relation as an anthropomorphic Creator was
   supposed to stand," and "bears a like relation with it not only to
   human thought, but to human feeling," etc.--Nineteenth Century, July

   [180] Mr. Spencer shows that Natural Selection fails as an explanation
   in proportion as life grows complex. "As fast," he says, "as the
   faculties are multiplied, so fast does it become possible for the
   several members of a species to have various kinds' of superiority over
   one another. While one saves its life by higher speed, another does the
   like by clearer vision, another by keener scent, another by quicker
   bearing, another by greater strength, another by unusual power of
   enduring cold und hunger, another by special sagacity, another by
   special timidity, another by special courage, and others by other
   bodily and mental attributes. Now it is unquestionably true that, other
   things being equal, each of these attributes giving its possessor an
   extra chance of life, us likely to be transmitted to posterity. But
   there seems no reason to suppose that it will be increased in
   subsequent generations by natural selection. . . . If those members of
   the species which have but ordinary shares of it nevertheless survive
   by virtue of other superiorities which they severally possess, then it
   is not easy to see how this particular attribute can be developed by
   natural selection in subsequent generations," etc.--Principles of
   Biology, sec. 166. Cf. Alfred W. Bennett in Martineau's Study of
   Religion, i. 280-282.

   Evolutionists themselves, those at least who are willing to allow their
   theory to be at all modified by facts, now perceive this; and hence we
   have the doctrine advanced by Mivart, Le Conte, and others, of critical
   periods,' or periods of rapid evolution alternating with others of
   greater quiescence."--Mod. Ideas, pp. 106, 107. See in both works the

   [182] Principal Shairp says: "To begin with the outward world, there

   an experience forced in upon the mind of the thoughtful naturalist
   that, penetrate unto nature wherever he may, thought has been there
   before him; that, to quote the words of one of the most distinguished,
   there is really a plan, which may he read in the relations which you
   and I, and all his-lining beings scattered over the surface of our

APPENDIX TO LECTURE III.

  GOD AS RELIGIOUS POSTULATE.

   IF we are to speak of God as a postulate of the soul, we must speak of
   Him as a postulate for the whole need of the soul--for its religious
   and its rational, not less than for its moral need. We must speak of
   Him also in such a way as to show that this postulate is not an
   arbitrary one, but springs necessarily from the soul's rational and
   moral constitution, and so as to explain the conviction of its truth by
   which it is accompanied. But this can only be done by showing that
   there are laws of man's spiritual nature which imperatively demand such
   and such an object, and by making it clear what these are. In like
   manner I would lay it down as a first principle, as against all
   psychological and empirical theories of religion, which propose to
   account for men's religious ideas and beliefs from natural causes
   (hopes and fears, animism, ghosts, etc.), without raising the question
   of how far they correspond with any outward reality, that no theory of
   religion can be adequate which does not cast light on the deepest
   ground of the soul's movement towards God, and on the nature of the
   object which alone can adequately satisfy it. This again assumes that
   there are laws of the spiritual nature which determine beforehand what
   the character of the object must be which alone can satisfy the
   religious necessity, and which impel the soul unceasingly to a search
   after that object. This, however, is precisely what I consider the
   truth about religion to be,- as a survey of its manifestations in
   history reveals its nature to us. Religion is not an arbitrary product
   of the soul. Even in the lowest and poorest religions we see something
   struggling into consciousness,--a want, a desire, a need,--which is not
   measured by the extent of its actual knowledge of the Divine. Religion
   we might define from this point of view as the search of the soul for
   an adequate spiritual object to rest in, combined with the
   consciousness that there is such an object, and with the impulse to
   seek after it and when found, to surrender itself to it. Now what kind
   of object is it which the soul thus demands? This can only be
   determined by the study of its laws, as these spring from its essential
   nature, and are exhibited on the field of historical religion. And
   here, I think, we are warranted to say--

   1. That the soul, as itself personal, demands for the satisfaction of
   its religious need, a personal object. From whatever source it derives
   its idea of the Divine (sense of dependence, outward impressions of
   nature, moral consciousness), it invariably personalises it. Over
   against its "I" it seeks a "Thou," and will rest satisfied with nothing
   less.

   2. That the soul, as thinking spirit, demands an infinite object. This
   is a proposition of some importance, and requires more careful
   consideration. We cannot err in seeking with Hegel the deepest ground
   of man's capacity for religion in his possession of the power of
   thought. The power of thought is not the whole of religion, but it is
   that which gives man his capacity for religion. The lower animals are
   irrational, and they have no religion. Thought, in this connection, may
   be described as the universalising principle in human nature. It is
   that which heads us to negate the limits of the finite. It is that
   which impels man from fact to principle, from law to wider law, from
   the collection of facts and laws in the universe to the principle on
   which the whole depends. It is the element of boundlessness in
   imagination, of illimitableness in desire, of insatiableness in the
   appetite for knowledge. On the side of religion we see it constantly at
   work, modifying the idea of the object of religion, and bringing it
   more into harmony with what it is felt that an object of worship ought
   to be. One way in which this is done is by the choice of the grander
   objects of nature--the sky, sun, mountains, etc.--as the embodiments
   and manifestations of the Divine. Another way is by the mere
   multiplication of the objects of idolatry--the mind seeking in this
   way, as it were, to fill up the gap in its depths. Another way is
   physical magnitude--hugeness. "Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
   gold, whose height was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof six
   cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura." [195]

   This love of the colossal is seen in most oriental religions (e.g.
   Egyptian, Assyrian). Another way is by what Max Muller calls
   Henotheism--fixing on one special deity, and treating it for the time
   being as if it was alone and supreme. Another way is by creating a
   "system," placing one deity at the head of the Pantheon, and making the
   rest subordinate. We have examples in the position held by Zeus and
   Jupiter in the Greek and Roman religions--a position described by Tiele
   as one of "Monarchism allied to Monotheism." Another way is by tracing
   back the origin of the gods, as in Hesiod, to some uncreated principle;
   or by placing behind them a fate, necessity, or destiny, which is a
   higher power than they. Finally, in the philosophical schools, we have
   reasoned Theism, or Pantheism, or some cosmic theory in which the
   universe itself becomes God. Through all, the search of the soul for an
   infinite is clearly discernible.

   3. That the soul, as itself ethical, demands an ethical object. It does
   this in all the higher forms of religion. It may be observed that, once
   the idea of an ethical God has been brought home to the mind, no lower
   conception of the Deity can be accepted. The agnostic himself--strongly
   as he protests against the knowableness of God--will yet be the first
   to maintain that it is impossible to entertain, even as hypothesis, any
   idea of God which represents Him as false, cruel, tyrannical,
   revengeful, unjust. He knows enough about God, at any rate, to be sure
   that He is not this.

   4. I may add that the soul, as itself an intelligence, demands a
   knowable object. It has previously been shown that, for purposes of
   religion, an unknowable God is equivalent to no God at all. Religion
   seeks not only a knowledge of its object, but such a knowledge as can
   be made the basis of communion. Here, again, we are led by the very
   idea of religion, to the expectation of Revelation. The bearing of all
   this on the Christian view is very obvious, It gives us a test of the
   validity of the Christian view, and it explains to us why this view
   comes home to the spirit of man with the self-evidencing power that it
   does. It comes to the spirit as light--attests its truth by its
   agreement with the laws of the spirit. The worth of this attestation is
   not weakened by the fact that the Christian religion itself mostly
   creates the very capacity by which its truth can be perceived--creates
   the organ for its own verification. It makes larger demands upon the
   spirit, calls forth higher ideas than any other; but, in doing so,
   reveals at the same time the spirit to itself. Brought to the foregoing
   tests, it discovers to us a God personal, infinite, ethical, and
   knowable, because self-revealing, and in this way answers the demands
   of the religious spirit.

LECTURE IV.

  THE POSTULATE OF THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF THE WORLD IN REGARD TO NATURE AND MAN.

    Introductory

   The Christian doctrine of God as personal, ethical, and self-revealing,
   carries with it a second postulate as to the nature of man. The
   Christian doctrine of God and the Christian doctrine of man are in fact
   correlatives. For how should man know that there is a personal,
   ethical, self-revealing God,--how should he be able to frame the
   conception of such a Being, or to attach any meaning to the terms
   employed to express His existence,--unless he were himself rational and
   moral--a spiritual personality? The two views imply each other, and
   stand or fall together. We may express this second postulate of the
   Christian view in the words, Man made in the image of God. [196]

   This truth of a natural kinship between the human spirit and the Divine
   is at once the oldest declaration in the Bible about man, and is
   implied in every doctrine of the Christian system. It is implied, as
   already said, in the knowledge of God, and in the call to fellowship
   with Him in holiness and love. It is implied in the Christian view of
   sin; for sin in the Christian view derives its tragic significance from
   the fact that it is a revolt of the creature will against the Divine
   will, to which it is by nature bound, that it cuts the soul off from
   its true life and blessedness in union with God. It is implied in
   regeneration, and in the capacity of the soul to receive the Spirit of
   God. For the Spirit of God does not enter the soul as something foreign
   and extraneous to it. He enters it as the principle of its true life.
   What, on the one side, we call the operations of the Spirit, or the
   presence of the Spirit in the soul, we call, on the other, the new life
   itself. The Divine and human here are but one and the same thing on two
   different sides. It is implied also in the call of man to a Divine
   sonship. It is the case, no doubt,--and the fact is one to be carefully
   considered,--that in Christ's teaching God is not called the Father of
   all men indiscriminately, nor is the title "son of God" given to all
   men indiscriminately. It is used only of those who are the subjects of
   spiritual renewal, and who bear in some measure the moral and spiritual
   likeness of the Father. [197] It does not denote a merely natural or
   physical relationships, but a moral bond as well. Deliberate and
   hardened transgressors are spoken of, not as children of Gods, but
   rather as children of the devil. [198] But this is only because these
   wicked persons have turned their backs on their own true destination.
   As made by God, and as standing in his normal relation to Him, man is
   without doubt a son. Hence, in the Gospel of Luke, though not by Christ
   Himself, Adam is called "the son of God," [199] and Paul does not
   scruple to quote the saying of the heathen poet, "For we also are His
   offspring." [200] The fact that the title "son of God" should belong to
   any, already implies a natural kinship between God and man, else the
   higher relationship would not be possible. If there were not already a
   God-related element in the human spirit, no subsequent act of grace
   could confer on man this spiritual dignity. [201]

   Not only in the Christian view in generals, but specially in the great
   central doctrine of the Incarnation, is this truth of man made in the
   image of God seen to be implied. I have already referred to certain
   services which the German speculative movement in the beginning of the
   century rendered to Christianity, in laying stress on the essential
   kinship which exists between the human spirit and the Divine, a thought
   never since lost sight of in theology. So long as the world is
   conceived of in deistic separation from God, it is inevitable that the
   Divine and human should be regarded as two opposed essences, between
   which true union is impossible. Once this point of view is overcome,
   and it is seen that the bond between God and man is inner and
   essential--that there is a God-related element in the human spirit
   which makes man capable of receiving from the Divine, and of becoming
   its living image--a great step is taken towards removing objections to
   the Incarnation. A union between the Divine and human is seen to be
   possible, to the intimacy of which no limits can be set,--which,
   indeed, only reaches its perfection when it becomes personal. The
   Incarnation has not only this doctrine of man as its presupposition--it
   is, besides, the highest proof of its truth. Christ, in His own
   Persons, is the demonstration of the truth of the Bible doctrine about
   man. To get a knowledge of the true essence of anything, we do not look
   at its ruder and less perfect specimens, but at what it is at its best.
   Christ is the best of humanity. He is not only the Revelation of God to
   humanity, but the Revelation of humanity to itself. In Him we see in
   perfect form what man in the Divine idea of him is. We see how man is
   made in the image of Gods, and how humanity is constituted the perfect
   organ for the Revelation of the Divine.

   It is evident that in the Christian view the doctrine of man links
   itself very closely with the doctrine of nature--of creation. It is not
   merely that man is related to nature by his body, but he is in
   Scripture, as in science, the highest being in nature. He is, in some
   sense, the final cause of nature, the revelation of its purpose, the
   lord and ruler of nature. Nature exists with supreme reference to him;
   is governed with a view to his ends; suffers in his fall; and is
   destined to profit by his Redemption. [202] I propose to begin with the
   natural basis--the doctrine of creation.

    I. The natural basis--the doctrine of creation.

   I. The Bible affirms, and perhaps it is the only book that does so,
   that all things, visible and invisible, have originated from God by a
   free act of creation. [203] The Bible doctrine of creation is something
   more than the Mosaic cosmogony. For my present purpose it is
   indifferent how we interpret the first chapter of Genesis--whether as
   the result of direct Revelation, or as the expression of certain great
   religious truths in such forms as the natural knowledge of the age
   admitted of. I believe myself that the narrative gives evidence of its
   Divine original in its total difference of character from all heathen
   cosmogonies, but this is a view I need not press. [204] The main point
   is the absolute derivation of all things from God, and on this truth
   the Scripture as a whole gives no uncertain sound. Discussions have
   been raised as to the exact force of the Hebrew word (bara) used to
   express the idea of creation, [205] but even this is of subordinate
   importance in view of the fact, which none will dispute, that the
   uniform teaching of Scripture is that the universe had its origin, not
   from the fashioning of pre-existent matter, but directly from the will
   and word of the Almighty. [206] "He spake, and it was done; He
   commanded, and it stood fast." [207]

   Not only is this doctrine of creation fundamental in Scripture, but it
   is of great practical significance. It might be thought, of what
   practical importance is it to us to know how the world originated? Is
   not this a question of purely speculative interest? But a moment's
   reflection will convince us that it is not so. The vital thing in
   religion is the relation of dependence. To feel that we and our world,
   that our human life and all that we are and have, absolutely depend on
   God,--this is the primary attitude of religion. For if they do not thus
   depend,--if there is anything in the universe which exists out of and
   independently of God,--then what guarantee have we for the unfailing
   execution of His purposes, what ground have we for that assured trust
   in His Providence which Christ inculcates, what security have we that
   all things will work together for good? But to affirm that all things
   depend on God is just in another way to affirm the creation of all
   things by God. They would not depend on Him if He were not their
   Creator. They do depend on Him, because they are created by Him. The
   doctrine of creation, therefore, is not a mere speculation.--Only this
   conviction that it is "the Lord that made heaven and earth" [208]
   --that "of Him, amid through Him, and to Him, are all things" [209]
   --that He has created all things, and for His pleasure they are and
   were created, [210] --can give us the confidence we need in a holy and
   wise government of the universe, and in a final triumph of good over
   evil.

   If the doctrine of creation is the only one which meets the wants of
   our religious nature, it may new further be affirmed that it is a
   doctrine consonant with reason, and consistent with all true knowledge.
   It is opposed, first, to all forms of dualism; secondly, to a merely
   logical derivation of the universe; and thirdly, to the atheistic
   assertion of the self-subsistence and eternity of the universe. Let us
   glance briefly at these various oppositions.

   1. Partly on metaphysical, partly on moral grounds, some have revived
   the old Platonic doctrine of an eternal matter, or ether independent
   principle, which exists alongside the Deity, and conditions and limits
   Him in His working. Thus Dr. Martineau holds that, in order to afford
   an objective field for the Divine operations, we must assume something
   to have been always there, a primitive datum, eternal as God Himself;
   [211] while the late J. S. Mill thought the difficulties of the
   universe could be best explained by supposing the Creator hampered by
   the insufficiency and intractableness of the materials He had to work
   with. [212] Karl Peters, a disciple of the pessimistic school already
   mentioned, sets up space as a second eternal principle beside God;
   [213] and others have held similar views. Philosophically, these
   theories are condemned by the fact that they set up two absolutes in
   the universe, which, if they really were absolutes, could never be
   brought into any relation to each other, much less be embraced in a
   single act of knowledge. Suppose this eternal matter to exist outside
   of God, how could it ever get to be known by God, or how could He ever
   act upon it, seeing that it has its being utterly apart from Him? Or,
   if it is not out of relation to His intelligence, by what middle term
   is this relation brought about? This, which applies to two absolutes,
   applies, of course, much more to a theory which starts from an infinity
   of independent atoms-- that is, from an infinite of absolutes. But
   these theories are weighted with difficulties of another kind. An
   absolutely quality less matter, or u le, such as Plato supposes, [214]
   is unthinkable and impossible. Plato himself is compelled to describe
   it as a me on, or nothing. It is a mere abstraction. [215] Is Dr.
   Martineau's eternal matter, which has no properties of any kind till
   the Creator bestows them upon it, in any better case? When, again, Mr.
   Mill identifies this eternal element, not with naked matter, but with
   the matter and force which we know-- with constituted matter, clothed
   with all its existing properties and laws--are we not in the new
   predicament of having to account for this matter? How came it there?
   Whence this definite constitution? Whence these powers and properties
   and laws which, in their marvellous adjustments and inter- relations,
   show as much evidence of design as any other parts of the universe? To
   suppose that "the given properties of matter and force, working
   together and fitting into one another" [216] --which is Mr. Mill's own
   phrase--need no explanation, but only the uses subsequently made of
   them, is to manifest a strange blindness to the fundamental conditions
   of the problem.

   2.If the Scripture view of creation is opposed to dualism in all its
   forms, it is not less opposed to every theory of a mere logical
   derivation of the universe--whether, with Spinoza, the universe is
   supposed to flow, with logical necessity, from an absolute substance;
   [217] or with Hegel, to be the development of an impersonal Reason; or
   with Green, to arise from a Reason that is self-conscious. It is this
   doctrine of a necessary derivation of the universe which takes the
   place in modern times of the old theories of emanation; but I shall
   only make two remarks on it. (1)It involves an amazing assumption. The
   assumption is that this universe, which exhibits so much evidence of
   wise arrangement, and of the free selection of means to attain ends, is
   the only universe possible, and could not, by any supposition, be other
   than it is. Such a theory may be the only one open to those who hold
   the ground of the universe to be impersonal; but it is not one which a
   true Theism can sanction, and it is unprovable. Why should infinite
   wisdom not choose its ends, and also freely choose the means by which
   they are to be accomplished? Which is the higher view--that which
   regards the Divine Being as bound down to a single system--one, too,
   which wisdom, love, and freedom have no share in producing, but which
   flows from the nature of its cause with the same necessity with which
   the properties of a triangle flow from the triangle; or that which
   supposes the universe to have originated in a free, intelligent act,
   based on the counsels of an infinite wisdom and goodness? [218] (2) As
   in this theory no place is left f or freedom in God, so logically it
   leaves no place for freedom in man. Freedom implies initiative,
   control, a choice between possible alternatives. But, on this theory we
   are considering, freedom can never be more than a semblance. Whether
   the individual recognises it or not, all that he sees around him, and
   all that takes place within him, is but the working out of an immanent
   logical necessity. [219] Things are what they are by a necessity as
   stringent as that which obtains in mathematics, and as little room is
   left for human initiative as on the most thorough-going mechanical or
   materialistic hypothesis. History, too, shows that the step from the
   one kind of determinism to the other is never difficult to take. The
   consciousness of (pg. 126-127 missing) freedom, however, is a fact too
   deeply rooted in our personality; too many interests depond on it to
   admit of its being this put aside at the bidding of any theory,
   metaphysical or other; and so long as human freedom stands, this view
   of the origin of the universe can never gain general acceptance.

   3. In the third place, the doctrine of creation is opposed to the
   atheistic assertion of the self-subsistence and eternity of the
   universe. I may here point out the indications which science itself
   gives that the universe is neither self-subsistent nor eternal.
   Science, indeed, cannot prove the creation of the world, but it may
   bring us to that point at which we are compelled to assume creation.

   (1) In the analysis of nature, science compels us to go back to
   primordial elements. The atomic constitution of matter seems one of the
   surest results of science, [220] and it is not yet suggested that these
   primordial elements are developed from one another by any process of
   evolution, or that their homogeneous structure and identical properties
   are to be accounted for by natural selection or any similar cause.
   Here, then, is one limit to evolution, and it is important that those
   who are disposed to regard evolution as all-embracing should take
   notice of it. But science not only tells us that the universe is built
   up of atoms, it finds that each of these atoms is a little world in
   itself in intricacy and complexity of structure; [221] and the fact
   that all atoms of the same class are exactly alike, perfect copies of
   each other in size, shape, weight, and proportion, irresistibly
   suggests the inference that they have a common cause. "When we see a
   real number of things," says Sir John Herschel, "precisely alike, we do
   not believe this similarity to have originated except from a common
   principle independent of them." Applying this to the atoms, he
   observes, "the discoveries alluded to effectually destroy the idea of
   an eternally self-existent matter, by giving to each of its atoms the
   essential characters at once of a manufactured article and a
   subordinate agent." [222] This reasoning, I think, will command general
   assent, though fastidiousness may be offended with the phrase
   "manufactured article" as applied to a work of Deity.

   (2) Science compels us to go back to a beginning in time. No doctrine
   comes here more powerfully to our support than the doctrine of
   evolution which some suppose to be a denial of creation. If the
   universe were a stable system,--i.e. if it were not in a condition of
   constant development and change,--it might with some plausibility be
   argued that it had existed from eternity. But our knowledge of the past
   history of the world shows us that this is not its character; that, on
   the contrary, it is progressive and developing. [223] Now it lies in
   the very thought of a developing universe that, as we trace it back
   through narrower and narrower circles of development, we come at last
   to a beginning,--to some point from which the evolution started. [224]
   The alternative to this is an eternal succession of cycles of
   existence, a theory which has often recurred, but which brings us back
   to the impossible conception of a chain without a first link, of a
   series every term of which depends on a preceding, while yet the whole
   series depends on nothing. [225] Science can give no proof of an
   eternal succession, but so far as it has any voice on the subject
   points in an opposite direction, by showing that when the universe has
   parted with its energy, as it is in constant process of doing, it has
   no means of restoring it again. [226]

   (3) Finally, it is the view of many distinguished evolutionists, that
   the course of evolution itself compels us to recognise the existence of
   breaks in the chain of development, where, as they think, some new and
   creative cause must have come into operation. I may instance Mr.
   Wallace, a thoroughgoing evolutionist, who recognises three such
   "stages in the development of the organic world, when some new cause or
   power must necessarily have come into action," viz. (a) at the
   introduction of life, (b) at the introduction of sensation or
   consciousness, (c) at the introduction of man. [227] With the view I
   hold of development as a process, determined from within, I do not feel
   the same need for emphasising these as "breaks." We have, indeed, at
   the points named, the appearance of something entirely new, but so have
   we, in a lesser degree, with every advance or improvement in the
   organism, e.g., with the first rudiment of an eye, or of a new organ of
   any kind. The action of the creative cause is spread along the whole
   line of the advance, revealing itself in higher and higher potencies as
   the development proceeds. It only breaks out more manifestly at the
   points named, where it founds a new order or kingdom of existence.
   [228]

   While thus advocating, as part of the doctrine of creation, a beginning
   of the world in time, I am not insensible to the enormous difficulties
   involved in that conception. Prior to that beginning we have still, it
   may appear, to postulate a beginningless eternity, during which God
   existed alone. The Divine purpose to create was there, but it had not
   passed into act. Here arises the difficulty. How are we to fill up in
   thought these blank eternal ages in the Divine life? The doctrine of
   the Trinity, with its suggestion of an internal Divine life and love,
   comes in as an aid, [229] but, abstracting from the thought of the
   world, of the universe afterwards to be created, we know of nothing to
   serve as a content of the Divine mind, unless it be the so-called
   "eternal truths." So that here we are in, presence of a great deep. A
   yet greater difficulty arises when we ask, Since God purposed to
   create, why was creation so long delayed? Why was a whole eternity
   allowed to elapse before the purpose was put into execution? [230] If
   it was a satisfaction to love and wisdom to produce a universe, why was
   creation not as eternal as the purpose of it? Why an eternity's
   quiescence, and then this transient act? Or rather, since in eternity
   no one moment is indistinguishable from another, why this particular
   moment chosen for creation? The very mentioning of these difficulties
   suggests that somehow we are on a wrong track, and that the solution
   lies--since solution there must be, whether we can reach it or not--in
   the revisal of the notions we set out with as to the relations of
   eternity to time.

   First, some have sought to cut this knot by the doctrine of an Eternal
   Creation. God, it is thought, did not wait through a solitary eternity
   before He called the world into existence--the act of creation is
   coeval with His Being, and the world, though a creature and dependent,
   is eternal as Himself. This was the doctrine of Origen in the early
   Church, of Erigena in the Middle Ages, and has been revived by Rothe,
   Darner, Lotze, and many others in modern times. It is carefully to be
   distinguished from the doctrine of a pre-existent eternal matter
   formerly referred to. But I do not think it solves the difficulty. It
   is either only the doctrine of an eternal series of worlds in another
   form,. and is exposed to all the difficulties of that assumption; or it
   seeks to evade these difficulties by the hypothesis of an undeveloping
   spiritual world, standing, as Dorner says, in the light of eternity,
   antecedent to the existing one--an hypothesis which leaves the origin
   of the temporal and developing world precisely where it was. Besides,
   how is the purpose of God ever to be summed up into a unity, if there
   is literally no beginning and no goal in creation? [231] Secondly,
   another form of solution is that of the speculative philosophers, who
   would have us regard the distinction of time and eternity as due only
   to our finite standpoint, and who bid us raise ourselves to that higher
   point of view from which all things are beheld, in Spinoza's phrase,
   sub specie aeternitatis. [232] The meaning of this is, that what exists
   for our consciousness as a time-development exists for the Divine
   consciousness as an eternally complete whole. For God, temporal
   succession has no existence. The universe, with all its determinations,
   past, present, and future, stands before the Divine mind in
   simultaneous reality. Language of this kind is found in Spinoza,
   Fichte, Hegel, Green, [233] and is to be met with sometimes in more
   orthodox theologians. It is, however, difficult to see what meaning can
   be attached to it which does not reduce all history to an illusion.
   [234] For, after all, time-development is a reality. There is
   succession in our conscious life, and in the events of nature. The
   things that happened yesterday are not the things that are happening
   to-day. The things that are happening today are not the things that
   will happen to-morrow. The past is past; the future is not yet come. It
   is plain that if time is a reality, the future is not yet present to
   God, except ideally. The events that will happen to-morrow are not yet
   existent. Else life is a dream; all, as the Indian philosophers say, is
   Maya,--illusion, appearance, seeming. Even if life is a dream, there is
   succession in the thoughts of that dream, and time is still not got rid
   of. I cannot see, therefore, that without reducing the process of the
   world to unreality, this view of it as an eternally completed fact can
   be upheld. In an ideal sense the world may be, doubtless is, present to
   the Divine mind; but as regards the parts of it yet future, it cannot
   be so actually. [235] What other solution, then, is possible? The
   solution must lie in getting a proper idea of the relation of eternity
   to time, and this, so far as I can see, has not yet been satisfactorily
   accomplished. The nearest analogy I can suggest is that of the
   spiritual thinking principle within ourselves, which remains a constant
   factor in all the flux of our thoughts and feelings. It is in the midst
   of them, yet it is out of the flux and above them. It is not involved
   in the succession of time, for it is the principle which itself relates
   things in the succession of time-for which, therefore, such succession
   exists. I would only venture to remark, further, that even if the
   universe were conceived of as originating in an eternal act, it would
   still, to a mind capable of tracing it back through the various stages
   of its development, present the aspect of a temporal beginning. Before
   this beginning, it would be possible for the mind to extend its vision
   indefinitely backwards through imaginary ages, which yet had no
   existence save as its own ideal construction. But God's eternity is not
   to be identified with this thought of an indefinitely extended time.
   Eternity we may rather take to be an expression for the timeless
   necessity of God's existence; and time, properly speaking, begins its
   course only with the world. [236] A few words before leaving this part
   of the subject on the motive and end of creation. If we reject the idea
   of metaphysical necessity, and think of creation as originating in a
   free, intelligent act, it must, like every similar act, be conceived of
   as proceeding from a motive, which includes in it at the -same time a
   rational end. And if God is free, personal Spirit, who is at the same
   time ethical Will, what motive is possible but goodness or love, or
   what end can be thought of but an ethical one? In this way it may be
   held that, though the universe is not the product of a logical or
   metaphysical necessity, it arises from the nature of God by a moral
   necessity which is one with the highest freedom, and thus the
   conception of creation may be secured from arbitrariness. It is an old
   thought that the motive to the creation of the world was the goodness
   of the Creator. Plato expresses this idea in his Timaeus, [237] and
   points to a yet more comprehensive view when, in the Republic, he names
   "the Good" as the highest principle both of knowledge and of existence.
   [238] Since the time of Kant, philosophy has dealt m very earnest
   fashion with this idea of "the Good"--now conceived of as ethical good,
   but likewise as including in it the highest happiness and
   blessedness--as at once the moving cause and end of the world. Start
   from the postulate of Kant, that moral ends are alone of absolute
   worth, and the inference is irresistible that the world as a whole is
   constituted for moral ends, and that it has its cause in a Supreme
   Original Good, which produces the natural for the sake of the moral,
   and is guiding the universe to a moral goal. [239] Hence, from his
   principles, Kant arrives at the notion of an ethical community or
   "Kingdom of God," having the laws of virtue as its basis and aim, as
   the end to which creation tends. [240] Lotze takes up the same thought
   of a world ordered in conformity with the idea of "the Good," and
   having its source in a Highest-Good Personal, and from him chiefly it
   has entered into Ritschlian theology. [241] But Christian theology from
   its own standpoint arrives at a similar result. We have but to ask,
   with Dorner, What is the relation of the ethical nature of God to the
   other distinctions we ascribe to Him? to see that "the non-ethical
   distinctions in and the nature of God are related to the ethical as
   means to an end; but the absolute end can only lie in morality, for it
   alone is of absolute worth." [242] In the graduated system of ends of
   which the universe consists, the moral, in other words, must be
   presumed to be the highest. And this is precisely what Christianity
   declares when it teaches that Christ and the kingdom of God are the
   consummation of God's world-purpose; that the government of the world
   is carried on for moral ends; and that "all things work together for
   good to them that love God." [243]

    II. The nature of man, and his place in creation: man the final cause of the
    world.

   II. From the point now reached, the transition is easy to the Scripture
   doctrine of the nature of man, and of his position in creation. I may
   begin here with man's place in creation, which of itself is a testimony
   which nature bears to the meaning and purpose of God in that creation.
   Assuming that final cause is to be traced in the world at all, we can
   get no better clue to it than by simply observing whither the process
   of development tends--what, as Mr. Spencer says, is "the naturally
   revealed end" towards which evolution works. [244] Here is a process of
   development, of evolution, going on for millenniums--what, as a matter
   of fact, do we find to be the outcome of it? At the base of the scale
   is inorganic matter; then we rise to organic life in the vegetable
   world; as a next round in the ladder of ascent we have animal and
   sentient life; we rise through all the gradations of that life--through
   insect, fish, reptile, bird, mammal--till at length, at the close of
   the long line of evolution, we find--What? Man, a self-conscious,
   personal, rational moral being; a being capable of entering not only
   into moral relations with his fellow-men, but, infinitely higher, into
   spiritual and moral relations with his invisible Creator. Man's
   creation, it is true, is only the starting-point of a new line of
   evolution, but that evolution is one of moral life. So far as the
   teaching of evolution goes, then, man is the crown and masterpiece of
   this whole edifice of creation, and this also is the teaching of the
   Bible. I have been frequently struck with this in reading the works of
   Mr. Spencer and of other evolutionists, that none of them supposes that
   evolution is ever to reach a higher being than man; that whatever
   future development there is to be will not be development beyond
   humanity, but development within humanity. In this it is implied that
   man is the end of nature, and that the end of nature is a moral one. In
   man, if we may so speak, mute and unintelligent nature attains to
   consciousness of itself, gains the power of reading back meaning into
   its own blind past, and has a prophecy of the goal to which its future
   tends. At the summit of nature's gradations--of her inorganic kingdom
   and plant kingdom and animal kingdom-there stands a being fitted for
   the kingdom of God.

   The agreement of Scripture and science up to this point is patent and
   incontestable. In the original picture in Genesis we have, as in
   nature, a gradually ascending series of creations. We have man at the
   top of the scale; man as the latest being of all, and distinguished
   from all by the fact that he alone bears his Creator's image; man set
   at the head of the lower orders of creatures, as God's rational
   vicegerent and representative. Science corroborates all this. It gives
   to man the same place in the ascending series of creations as Scripture
   gives him; declares him to be the last and final product of nature;
   links him intimately with the past through his physical organisation,
   in which the whole of nature, as physiology shows, recapitulates
   itself; and at the same time acknowledges that he stands alone, and far
   removed from the other creatures, in his powers of thought and
   language, in his capacity for a selfregulated moral life under general
   rules, in his religious nature, in his capability of progress, and of
   boundless productivity in arts, sciences, laws, and institutions. Nay,
   looking at creation as a whole, from the vantage-ground which our
   present know ledge gives us, we can feel that its plan would have
   remained incomplete, its pyramid would have lacked a summit, had man
   not appeared upon the scene. For man not only stands at the head of
   creation, but, in virtue of his rational nature, he occupies a position
   in relation to it different from every other. The animal, however high
   in the scale of development, is a mere creature of nature; man has a
   life above nature. He is a being of "large discourse, looking before
   and after." [245] He is capable of reflection on himself; on the
   meaning and causes of things in the world around him; on the ends of
   his own existence. He can rise above momentary impulse and passion, and
   guide his life by general principles of reason, and so is capable of
   morality. For the same reason he is capable of religion, and shows his
   superiority over nature through the thoughts he cherishes of God, of
   infinity, of eternity. Till a mind of this kind appeared, capable of
   surveying the scene of its existence, of understanding the wisdom and
   beauty displayed in its formations, and of utilising for rational
   purposes the vast resources laid up in its treasuries, the very
   existence of such a world as this is remained an inexplicable riddle:
   an adequate final cause--an end-for-self--was not to be found in it.
   [246] It would indeed be an exaggeration to view creation solely from
   the standpoint here taken. The position that man is the final cause of
   creation must obviously be held with certain qualifications. Were we to
   attempt to maintain that the world exists solely for man's use and
   benefit, we would be met by unanswerable objections. Because man is the
   supreme end of nature, it does not follow that there are not lower
   ends--the happiness of the sentient creatures, e.g., and many others
   that we do not know. This world, again, is part of a wider system, and
   there may be not only lower ends, but wider ends, than those prescribed
   by man's existence. There is a delight which creative wisdom has in its
   own productions, which is an end in itself. God saw the works that He
   had made, and behold they were good; though not till man appeared upon
   the scene were they declared "very good." [247] But this in no degree
   militates against the position that the main use and end of nature is
   to subserve the purposes of man's existence. Is not this to a thinking
   mind implied in its very dispositions and arrangements, in its
   distribution of land and sea, in its river plains and ocean
   communication, in its supplies of mineral and other wealth stored up in
   its recesses, in the forces it puts at man's disposal for the
   accomplishment of his purposes, in the very obstacles it interposes in
   the way of his advancement, stimulating his mental activity, summoning
   forth his powers to contend with difficulties, and in this way rousing
   him up to further conquests? There are yet higher teleological
   relations which nature sustains to man, on which I cannot now
   dwell--the part, e.g., which natural conditions play, as in Greece, in
   the development of the character and spirit of peoples; the food which
   the study of nature affords to his intellect; the beauty which
   delights, and the sublimity which awes him, both speaking to his spirit
   of things higher than them-selves; the suggestions it gives of the
   infinite and eternal, etc. Taking it all in all, we may rest in the
   view that man, as nature's highest being, is the key to the
   understanding of the whole development; that nature does not exist for
   its own sake, but supremely for the sake of the moral; that its chief
   end is to furnish the means for such a development as we now see in the
   mental and moral history of mankind. [248]

   As a compound being, made up of body and of spirit, man is the link
   which unites the natural and the spiritual worlds. [249] The direct
   link between man and nature is the body, which in its erect posture,
   its highly evolved brain, its developed limbs, and its countenance
   lifted up to the heavens, bears witness, as already Ovid reminds us,
   [250] to the dignity of the soul within. As Materialism ignores the
   rights of the spirit, and would reduce thought, feeling, and will, to
   functions of matter; so an ultra-spirituality is too apt to ignore the
   rights of the body, and to regard it as a mere accident of man's
   personality. Materialism quite rightly protests against this
   one-sidedness; and the whole tendency of modern inquiry is to draw the
   two sides of man's nature--the material and the spiritual, the physical
   and the metaphysical, the physiological and the mental--more closely
   together. The Bible avoids both extremes. Materialism gets all its
   rights in the Bible doctrine of the body. The abstract spirituality of
   a Plotinus, or of a hyper-refined idealism, which regards the body as a
   mere envelope of the soul, dropped off at death without affecting its
   entirety, is quite foreign to it. I do not dwell on this now, as I
   shall have occasion to refer to it in the following Lectures. Enough to
   remark that the Bible history of man's creation; the remarkable honour
   its places on the body as God's workman ship and the temple of the Holy
   Ghost; its doctrines of sin, with death as the penalty; of the
   Incarnation--"forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and
   blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same"; [251] of
   Redemption, which includes "the Redemption of the body"; [252] of the
   future life in a glorified corporeity--all warn us against an undue
   depreciation of the body. I go on to remark that if the Bible gives its
   rightful place to the body, much more does it lay stress on the
   possession by man of a spirit, which is the true seat of his
   personality, and the link which unites him with the spiritual world,
   and with God. Psychological questions would be here out of place, and I
   can only enter into a very brief examination of the Biblical terms used
   to express the different aspects of man's spiritual nature, relegating
   the further discussion of these to their proper sphere in Biblical
   theology or psychology. [253] I would first remark that the Biblical
   usage of psychological terms can only be understood if we keep strictly
   to the Biblical point of view. In the Old Testament, it is the unity of
   the personality which is the main fact, and not the distinction of an
   immaterial and a material part, as in our modern usage. Nephesh or soul
   does not, in the Old Testament, stand opposed to body, but is rather
   the principle of "life," which manifests itself on the one hand in the
   corporeal functions ("the life is in the blood" [254] , and on the
   other in the conscious activities of the mind. The real contrast in the
   Old Testament is between "flesh" (basar) and "spirit" (ruach), and the
   "soul" is the middle term between them, the unity of them. [255] This
   does not mean that "soul" and "spirit" are separable elements in the
   same way that "soul" and "body" are, but it means that the "soul," as
   inbreathed by God, is the source or seat of a double life. On the one
   side, it is the animating principle of the body; the source of all
   vital functions. It is its presence in the body which constitutes the
   latter "flesh." On the other side, it is the principle of
   self-conscious life. Various names are employed to denote the kinds of
   these self-conscious activities; but they may be grouped generally
   under the name "spirit." More explicitly, all the activities of the
   "spirit" belong to the "soul"; but the converse is not true, that all
   the activities of the "soul" belong to the "spirit." For the vital
   functions of the body, with the appetites, desires, impulses, etc.,
   which belong to this side of our nature, likewise are traceable to it
   as their source. It is only the higher activities of the "soul"--those
   which we still denominate "spiritual"--I speak of general usage, for
   probably there is no distinction we can make which has not some
   exception--which are described by the term "spirit." Thus we read of a
   spirit of wisdom, of knowledge, of understanding, of an upright spirit,
   a free spirit, a contrite spirit, etc. [256] That the "soul,"
   essentially considered, is also spiritual, is implied in its origin
   from the Divine Spirit. In the New Testament we have a distinction of
   "soul" and "body" much more akin to our own, though the influence of
   Old Testament usage is still very marked. "Soul" (psuche) still
   includes a higher and a lower life; and the higher life is still
   denoted by the term "spirit" (pneuma); while the implication of a body
   is still always conveyed in the term "soul." There is no "soul" which
   is not intended to animate a "body"; there are incorporeal spirits
   (angels, demons), but they are not called by the name "souls." On the
   other hand, the "soul" is recognised as spiritual in its essence, and
   in its disembodied state is classed among "spirits," e.g. "the spirits
   in prison." [257] I need not discuss the cognate terms heart (kardia),
   mind (nous), understanding (dianoia), etc., but content myself with
   saying that, except in the sense above explained, I do not see how a
   trichotomous view of man's nature can be maintained. The distinction of
   "soul" and "spirit" is a distinction within the one indivisible
   spiritual nature; and the antithesis "soul" and "body" really covers
   all the facts of man's personal life. The highest functions of the
   "spirit" arc in the New Testament ascribed also to the "soul"; [258]
   and the "soul" in turn is used by Jesus as a name f or man's highest
   imperishable life. "He that hateth his life (psuche) in this world
   shall keep it unto life eternal." [259]

   From this digression I return to the fact that it is in his "soul" or
   "spirit" that man peculiarly bears the Divine image. In a threefold
   respect is man the personal image of his Maker.

   1. He bears first of all the rational image of God. We have a proof of
   this in the fact formerly referred to, that man can understand the
   world God has made. How is science possible, except on the assumption
   that the reason we find in ourselves is the same in kind as the reason
   which expresses itself in the universe? The argument is the same as if
   we were set to translate a book written in a foreign language. The
   first condition of success in that attempt--the postulate with which we
   set out--is similarity of intelligence between the man who wrote the
   book, and ourselves who seek to decipher its meaning. If his reason
   were of a totally different kind from ours, the attempt to understand
   him would be hopeless. Precisely the same condition applies to the
   possibility of our knowledge of the world. Reason in man and the reason
   expressed in nature must be the same in kind, or no relation between
   them could be established. Christian theology expresses this by saying
   that the world is created by the Logos, a term which means at once
   reason and word.

   2. Man bears God's moral image, not now in the possession of actual
   righteousness, but in the possession of the indestructible elements of
   a moral nature. (1) He is a being with the power of moral knowledge;
   reason, in other words, is the source to him, not only of principles of
   knowledge, but of laws of duty. The idea of the good, and with it the
   moral "ought" or ethical imperative, is part of his constitution. His
   moral ideal may vary with the degree of his development and culture;
   but, throughout, man is a being who distinguishes good and evil, and
   who recognises the obligation to obey the good and to eschew the evil.
   In this he proclaims himself a subject of moral law, and a being with a
   moral destiny. (2) He is a free, spiritual cause, i.e. he has moral
   freedom. I speak again not of man as at present he actually is, with
   his freedom sadly impaired through sin, but of man in the constitutive
   elements of his nature. And as a free, spiritual, self-determining
   cause, standing at the summit of nature, man is again in a very marked
   sense the image of his Maker. It is this power of will and
   self-decision in man which most of all constitutes him a person.
   Through it he stands out of and above nature's sequences, and can react
   on and modify them. He is, as some have chosen to regard him, a
   supernatural cause in the order of nature. [260] It is surely of little
   use to deny the possibility of miracle, when every human volition is a
   species of miracle--a new, hyperphysical cause interpolated in the
   chain of physical events, and giving them a hew direction. (3) Man is a
   being with moral affections. Without these he would not be a true image
   of the God who is love. Summing up these points, we recognise in man a
   conscience which reveals moral law, a will which can execute moral
   purposes, and affections which create a capacity for moral love. This
   relates only to formal attributes; but it is now to be remarked that
   the bearing of God's moral image in the full sense implies not only the
   possession of these attributes, but an actual resemblance to God in
   character, in holiness and love. In the primeval state--the status
   integritatis of the Biblical account [261] --this possession of the
   image of God by man can only be viewed as potentiality, though a pure
   potentiality, for the perfected image could not be gained except as the
   result of self-decision and a long process of development, if even then
   without the appearance of the second Adam from heaven. [262] It is
   Christ, not the first Adam who is the ideal here, the model after which
   we are to be renewed in the image of Him who created us. Only in Christ
   do we see what a humanity perfectly conformed to the Divine idea of it
   is.

   3. Man bears the image of God in his deputed sovereignty over the
   creatures, a sovereignty which naturally belongs to him in virtue of
   the attributes just enumerated, and of his place at the head of
   creation already adverted to. To the reality of this sovereignty, all
   man's conquests over material conditions, his achievements in art and
   civilisation, his employment of nature's laws and forces for his own
   ends, his use of the lower creatures for service and food, etc.,
   abundantly testify. [263]

   I might add one other mark of the possession of the Divine image by
   man, likewise involved in his self-conscious personality. I refer to
   what may be called the potential infinitude of his nature. It has often
   been remarked that man could not even know himself to be finite, if he
   were not able in thought to transcend the finite, and frame an idea of
   the Infinite. It is the strange thing about him, yet not strange once
   we realise what is implied in the possession of a thinking nature, that
   though finite, hedged round on every side by the limitations of the
   finite, he yet shows a constant impulse to transcend these limitations,
   and ally himself with the Infinite. Through this peculiarity of his
   nature, there is none of God's infinite attributes which does not find
   a shadow in his soul How else could Carlyle, e.g., fill his pages with
   references to the eternities, the immensities, etc., in which man's
   spirit finds its awful home? Is a being who can form the idea of
   eternity not already in affinity with the Eternal, in a sense His
   image? Man is not omnipresent, but is there not a shadow of God's
   omnipresence in those thoughts of his that roam through space, and find
   a satisfaction in the contemplation of its boundlessness? He is not
   omniscient, but is not his desire for knowledge insatiable? The same
   spurning of bounds, the same illimitableness, is seen in all his
   desires, aims, ideals, hopes, and aspirations. This shows the folly of
   the contention that because man is finite, he is cut off from the
   knowledge of the Infinite. The objection seems to turn on the thought
   that there is a physical bigness in the idea of infinity which prevents
   the mind from holding it. It might as well be contended that because
   the mind is cooped up within the limits of a cranium only a few inches
   in diameter, it cannot take account of the space occupied, say by the
   solar system, or of the distance between the earth and the sun!

   In thus affirming the spiritual nature and dignity of man, and a
   sonship to God founded thereon, it was inevitable that the Christian
   view should meet with keen opposition from the modern
   anti-supernaturalistic tendency, which regards with extreme disfavour
   any attempt to lift man out of the ranks of nature, and the prevailing
   bias of which is strongly towards Materialism. In this spirit Professor
   Huxley has told us that "anyone who is acquainted with the history of
   science will admit that its progress has, in all ages, meant, and now
   more than ever means, the extension of the province of what we call
   matter and causation, and the concomitant banishment from all regions
   of human thought of what we call spirit and spontaneity." [264] The
   materialistic hypothesis has wide currency at the present day, though
   it is difficult to see how any sober mind, reflecting on the patent
   difference between mental and physical phenomena, could ever suppose
   that it was adequate, or could imagine that by its aid it had got rid
   of "spirit." As involving the denial of the existence of a spiritual
   principle in man, distinct from the body, this hypothesis is manifestly
   in contradiction with the Biblical doctrine just explained, and on this
   account claims a brief consideration.

   The great fact on which every theory of Materialism strikes is, of
   course, the fact of consciousness. Life, unattended by sensation,
   presents a great enough difficulty to the theorist who would explain
   everything on mechanical principles, [265] but when consciousness
   enters the difficulty is insuperable. [266] It is, at the same time, no
   easy matter to bind down the advocates of the materialistic theory to a
   clear and consistent view.

   1. There is the crass, thorough going Materialism which literally
   identifies brain with mind, and the movements of the brain with the
   thoughts and feelings of which we are aware in consciousness. Brain
   action, on this hypothesis, is thought and feeling. "The brain," says
   Cabanis, "secretes thought, as the liver secretes bile." This is the
   crude theory of writers like Moleschott, Vogt, and Buchner, but it is
   too manifestly absurd--it too palpably ignores the striking differences
   between mental and physiological facts--to be accepted by more cautious
   scientists without qualification. Brain movements are but changes of
   place and relation on the part of material atoms, and, however caused,
   are never more than motions; they have nothing of the nature of thought
   about them. "It is absolutely and for ever inconceivable," says the
   distinguished German physiologist, Du Bois-Reymond, "that a number of
   carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms should be otherwise than
   indifferent to their own positions or motions, past, present, or
   future. It is utterly inconceivable how consciousness should result
   from their joint action." [267] There is, accordingly, general
   agreement among scientific thinkers that the physical changes and the
   mental phenomena which accompany them are two distinct sets of facts,
   which require to be carefully kept apart. "The passage from the physics
   of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness," says
   Professor Tyndall, "is unthinkable." [268] "I know nothing, and never
   hope to know anything," says Professor Huxley, "of the steps by which
   the passage from molecular movement to states of consciousness is [269]
   "The two things are on two utterly different platforms," says Professor
   Clifford; "the physical facts go along by themselves, and the mental
   facts go along by themselves." [270] So far as this goes, it is clearly
   in favour of spiritualism, and would seem in consistency to require the
   abandonment of Materialism. [271]

   2. An escape, however, may seem to be afforded from this dilemma, by
   consenting to regard matter as itself but the phenomenal manifestation
   of some unknown power, as therefore not the ultimate reality, but only
   a form or appearance of it to our senses. This is the view held by
   Strauss, Lange, Haeckel, Spencer, and the scientific professors whose
   words I have just quoted. "I have always," says Strauss, "tacitly
   regarded the so loudly proclaimed contrast between Materialism and
   Idealism (or by whatever terms one may designate the view opposed to
   the former) as a mere quarrel about words. They have a common foe in
   the dualism which has pervaded the view of the world (Weltansicht),
   through the whole Christian era, dividing man into body and soul, his
   existence into time and eternity, and opposing an eternal Creator to a
   created and perishable universe." [272] But whatever the change in the
   theoretic groundwork, this view in practice comes to very much the same
   thing as the other. It will not be disputed that it does so with
   Strauss and his German allies, whose Materialism is most pronounced.
   [273] But our English savants also, while disclaiming the name
   "materialists," while maintaining in words the distinction between the
   two classes of facts (mental and physical), while careful to show that
   a strict interpretation of the data would land us rather in a
   subjective Idealism than in Materialism, [274] none the less proceed
   constantly upon the hypothesis that mental facts admit of being
   translated (as they call it) into terms of matter, and that thus only
   are they capable of being treated by science. [275] Thus, Professor
   Huxley speaks of our thoughts as "the expression of molecular changes
   in that matter of life which is the source of our other vital
   phenomena," [276] of consciousness as "a function of nervous matter,
   when that matter has attained a certain degree of organisation." [277]
   This is carried out so far as to deny the existence of any freedom in
   volition, or indeed of any influence exercised by consciousness at all
   upon the train of physical events.

   One advantage of this materialistic-idealistic form of the theory is,
   that it enables the theorist to play fast and loose with language on
   matter and mind, and yet, when called to account, to preserve an
   appearance of consistency by putting as much or as little meaning into
   the term "matter" as he pleases. Professor Tyndall is eloquent on the
   "opprobrium" which we, in our ignorance, have heaped on matter, in
   which he prefers to discern "the promise and potency of every form of
   life." [278] But lie has to admit that, before he can do this, he has
   to make a change in all ordinarily received notions of matter. "Two
   courses and two only are possible," he says. "Either let us open our
   doors freely to the conception of creative acts, or, abandoning them,
   let us radically change our notions of matter." [279] To which Dr.
   Martineau very justly replies, "Such extremely clever matter, matter
   that is up to everything, even to writing Hamlet, and finding out its
   own evolution, and substituting a moral plebiscite for a Divine
   government of the world, may fairly be regarded as a little too modest
   in its disclaimer of the attributes of mind." [280] My chief objection
   to Dr. Tyndall, however, is that practically he does not change his
   notion of matter, but, ignoring his own admission of the "chasm
   intellectually impassable" [281] between the two classes of phenomena,
   persists in treating mind as if it were capable of being adequately
   represented by molecular changes of matter, in the ordinary acceptation
   of the word. Instead, however, of supporting the view that molecular
   changes and mental functions are convertible terms, science, with its
   doctrine of the "conservation of energy," has furnished, as we shall
   now see, a demonstration of the opposite.

   There are three points at which, in the light of modern science and
   philosophy, the argument for Materialism is seen utterly to break down.

   1. The first is that which I have just alluded to, the impossibility of
   accounting for the phenomena of consciousness in consistency with the
   scientific doctrine of the "conservation of energy." As already
   remarked, none but the very crassest materialists will maintain that
   the molecular changes in the brain are themselves the thoughts and
   feelings which we are aware of in consciousness. What the physicist
   will say is, that these changes are attended by certain conscious
   phenomena as their concomitants. You have the motions, and you have the
   conscious fact--the thought or feeling--alongside of it. This is the
   way in which the matter is put by writers like Huxley and Tyndall, who
   frankly confess, as we have seen, the unbridgeable gulf between the two
   classes of phenomena. But, once this is admitted, the assertion that
   mental phenomena are products of cerebral changes is seen to come into
   collision with the scientific law of conservation. If mental phenomena
   are produced by material causes, it can only be at the expense of some
   measure of energy. This, indeed, is what is affirmed. Physical energy,
   it is supposed, is transformed into vital energy, this again into
   thought and feeling. But this, it can be shown to demonstration, is
   precisely what does not take place. Every scientific man admits that
   energy in all its active forms is simply some kind of motion; and that
   what is called "transformation of energy" (heat into light or
   electricity, etc.) is merely change from one kind of motion into
   another. What, then, becomes of the energy which is used when some
   change takes place in the matter of the brain, accompanied by a fact of
   sensation? It is all accounted for in the physical changes. No
   scientific man will hold that any part of it disappears, passes over
   into an "unseen universe." With keen enough senses you could track that
   energy through every one of its changes, and see its results in some
   physical effect produced. The circuit is closed within the physical.
   Motions have produced motions, nothing more, and every particle of
   energy present at the beginning is accounted for in the physical state
   of the brain at the end. There has been no withdrawal of any portion of
   it, even temporarily, to account for the conscious phenomenon. [282]
   This is a new outside fact, lying beyond the circle of the physical
   changes, a surplusage in the effect, which there is nothing in the
   expenditure of energy to explain. It is a fact of a new order, quite
   distinct from physical motions, and apprehended through a distinct
   faculty, self-consciousness. But, apart from the nature of the fact,
   there is, as I say, no energy available to account for it. What energy
   there is, is used up in the brain's own motions and changes, and none
   is left to be carried over for the production of this new conscious
   phenomenon. If this is true of the simplest fact of consciousness, that
   of sensation, much more is it true of the higher and complex activities
   of self-conscious life. [283]

   2. The second point on which Materialism breaks down is the
   impossibility of establishing any relation between the two sets of
   phenomena in respect of the laws of their succession. The mental facts
   and the physical facts, we are told, go along together. But it is not
   held that there is no relation between them. And the relation is,
   according to Professor Huxley, that the mental order is wholly
   determined by the physical order; while, conversely, consciousness is
   not allowed to exercise the slightest influence on the physical series.
   Consciousness he thinks, in men as in brutes, to be "related to the
   mechanism of the body simply as a collateral product of its working,
   and to be as completely without any power of modifying that working as
   the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is
   without influence upon its machinery." [284] The physical changes, in
   other words, would go on precisely as they do, in obedience to their
   own laws, were there no such thing as consciousness in existence; and
   consciousness is simply a byeproduct or reflex of them without any
   counter-influence. Similarly, Mr. Spencer says, "Impossible as it is to
   get immediate proof that feeling and nervous action are the outer and
   inner faces of the same change, yet the hypothesis that they are so
   harmonises with all the observed facts"; [285] and again, "While the
   nature of that which is manifested under either form proves to be
   inscrutable, the order of its manifestations throughout all mental
   phenomena proves to be the same as the order of its manifestations
   throughout all material phenomena." [286] The one point clear in these
   statements is that in the materialistic hypothesis the order of mental
   phenomena is identical with an order of physical phenomena, determined
   by purely mechanical conditions. [287] Is this according to fact, or is
   it not precisely the point where a materialistic explanation of mind
   must for ever break down? On the hypothesis, the one set of phenomena
   follow purely physical (mechanical, chemical, vital) laws; but the
   other set, or a large part of the other set (the mental), follow laws
   of rational or logical connection. Suppose a mind, for example,
   following out the train of reasoning in one of the propositions in
   Euclid--or, better still, think of this demonstration as it was first
   wrought out in the discoverer s own mind. What is the order of
   connection here? Is it not one in which every step is determined by the
   perception of its logical and rationally necessary connection with the
   step that went before? Turn now to the other series. The laws which
   operate in the molecular changes in the brain are purely
   physical--mechanical, chemical, vital. They are physical causes,
   operating to produce physical effects, without any reference to
   consciousness. What possible connection can there be between two orders
   so distinct, between an order determined solely by the physical laws,
   and the foregoing process of rational demonstration? The two orders
   are, on the face of them, distinct and separate; and not the least
   light is cast by the one on the other. To suppose that the physical
   laws are so adjusted as to turn out a product exactly parallel to the
   steps of a rational demonstration in consciousness, is an assumption of
   design so stupendous that it would cast all other proof of teleology
   into the shade. I am far, however, from admitting that, as the
   materialistic hypothesis supposes, every change in the brain is
   determined solely by mechanical, chemical, and vital laws. Granting
   that cerebral changes accompany thought, I believe, if we could see
   into the heart of the process, it would be found that the changes are
   determined quite as much by mental causes as by material. I do not
   believe, for example, that an act of will is wholly without influence
   on the material sequence. Our mental acts, indeed, neither add to nor
   take from the energy stored up in the brain, but they may have much to
   do with the direction and distribution of that energy. [288]

   3. A third point on which the materialistic hypothesis breaks down is
   its irreconcilability with what is seen to be implied in
   self-consciousness, and with the fact of moral freedom. To constitute
   self-consciousness, it is not enough that there should be a stream or
   succession of separate impressions, feelings, or sensations; it is
   necessary that there should be a principle which apprehends these
   impressions, and relates them (as resembling, different, co-existent,
   successive, etc.) to one another and to itself, a principle which not
   only remains one and the same throughout the changes, but is conscious
   of its self-identity through them. It is not merely the mental changes
   that need to be explained, but the consciousness of a persistent self
   amidst these changes. And this ego or self in consciousness is no
   hyperphysical figment which admits of being explained away as
   subjective illusion. It is only through such a persistent, identical
   self, that knowledge or thought is possible to us; it is implied in the
   simplest analysis of an act of knowledge. Were we simply part of the
   stream, we could never know it [289] As another fact of our conscious
   life incompatible with subjection to mechanical conditions, I need only
   refer to the consciousness of moral freedom. In principle, Materialism
   is the denial of moral freedom, or of freedom of any kind, and with its
   triumph moral life would disappear. [290]

   These considerations are sufficient of themselves to refute
   Materialism, but the final refutation is that which is given by the
   general philosophical analysis of the relation of thought to existence,
   a subject on which I do not enter further than I have already done in
   the previous Lecture. Thought, as I tried to show there, is itself the
   prius of all things; and in attempting to explain thought out of
   matter, we are trying to account for it by that which itself requires
   thought for its explanation. Matter, which seems to some the simplest
   of all conceptions to work with, is really one of the most difficult;
   and the deeper its nature is probed, whether on the physical or on the
   metaphysical side, the more does it tend to disappear into something
   different from itself; the more, at any rate, is it seen to need for
   its explanation facts that are spiritual. It was remarked above how,
   even in the hands of Professors Huxley and Tyndall, matter tends to
   disappear in a subjective Idealism; the only escape from this is a
   rational theory of knowledge, which again explains the constitution of
   the world through rational categories. To explain thought out of matter
   is, from a philosophical point of view, the crowning instance of a
   hysteron proteron. [291]

    III. Man as made in the image of God constituted for immortality.

   III. From the distinction thus shown to exist between the spiritual and
   the material parts of man's nature, there results the possibility of
   the soul surviving death, and the foundation is laid for the doctrine
   of Immortality. The consideration of the Biblical aspect of this
   subject will more properly be reserved for next Lecture, where I treat
   of the connection of sin and death. Here I will only ask how far nature
   and reason have a voice to utter on these two questions: Is man
   constituted for immortality? And is there a presumption that the soul
   will survive death? These questions, it ought to be observed, are not
   identical. The proposition that man, as a being made in God's image, is
   naturally destined for immortality, is not immediately convertible with
   the other, that the soul will survive death; for it is no part of the
   Biblical view, as we shall see afterwards, that death is a natural
   condition of man. Now, however, that death has supervened, the question
   arises, Does the soul still survive? To this question also, as I hope
   to show, both Old and New Testaments give an affirmative answer; but
   the complete Scripture doctrine of immortality means a great deal more
   than this.

   It is a significant circumstance that the modern unbelieving view of
   the world has no hope to give us of a life beyond the grave. With the
   obscuration of the idea of God, and the loss of the sense of the
   spiritual, there has gone also faith in immortality. [292] Materialism,
   of course, is bound to deny a future life. The theories of Huxley,
   Tyndall, and Spencer hold out just as little hope of it, [293] though
   Mr. Fiske, developing a Theism out of the principles of Mr. Spencer,
   has developed also a doctrine of immortality, another evidence of the
   connection of these two belief's. [294] The hope proposed to us in lieu
   of individual immortality is that of "corporate immortality," the
   privilege of joining the "choir invisible" of those who have laboured
   in the service of humanity, though they live now only in the grateful
   memory of posterity. [295] Pantheism, likewise, forbids the thought of
   personal immortality, exalting instead the blessedness of absorption in
   the Infinite. [296] We cannot, however, part with the hope of
   immortality without infinitely lowering the whole pulse and worth even
   of present existence. [297]

   The only scientific plea on which the possibility of immortality can be
   denied to us is based on the fact that mind in this life is so
   intimately bound up with physiological conditions. Once grant, however,
   that the thinking principle in man is distinct from the brain which it
   uses as its instrument, and no reason can be shown, as Bishop Butler
   demonstrated long, ago, why it should not survive the shock of the
   dissolution we call death. Death need not even be the suspension of its
   powers. "Suppose," says Cicero, "a person to have been educated from
   his infancy in a chamber where he enjoyed no opportunity of seeing
   external objects but through a small chink in the window shutter, would
   he not be apt to consider this chink as essential to his vision? and
   would it not be difficult to persuade him that his prospects would be
   enlarged by demolishing the walls of his prison?" [298] It may turn
   out, as Butler says, that existing and bodily conditions are rather
   restraints on mind than laws of its essential nature. [299] Even so
   rigid a critic of evidence as the late J. S. Mill admits that this
   argument against immortality from the present dependence of thought and
   feeling on some action of the bodily organism, is invalid. "there is,
   therefore," he says, "in science, no evidence against the immortality
   of the soul, but that negative evidence which consists in the absence
   of evidence in its favour. And even the negative evidence is not so
   strong as negative evidence often is." [300] It may, at the same time,
   be questioned, as we have seen, whether there are not limits to the
   extent to which science has demonstrated the dependence of the higher
   mental operations on cerebal changes. [301] Science, therefore, cannot
   negative the idea of immortality, but has reason no positive utterance
   to give on this great and solemn question of future existence? It is
   not men of science only, but some believers in Revelation also, who
   show a disposition to minimise the indications and corroborations which
   nature affords of man's immortal destiny. Mr. Edward White does this in
   support of his theory of conditional immortality; [302] but many others
   also have held the opinion that this is a question on which reason has
   little or nothing to say, and which must be determined solely by the
   light of Revelation. This position seems to me a hazardous one for a
   believer in Revelation to take up. Just as in speaking of Theism I
   ventured to say that, if God exists, it is inconceivable that nature
   should afford no evidence of His existence; [303] so I would say here
   that if human immortality be a truth, it is impossible that it should
   be only, or merely, a truth of Revelation. If, as he came from his
   Creator's hand, it was man's destiny to be immortal, his fitness and
   capacity for that destiny must reveal itself in the very make and
   constitution of his being, in the powers and capabilities that belong
   to him. If it could really be shown that in man's nature, as we find
   it, no trace of anything exists pointing to a higher sphere of
   existence than earth affords, no powers or capabilities for which this
   earthly scene did not offer full employment or satisfaction, this
   alone, without any other argument, would be a cogent disproof of
   immortality. For the same reason, immortality cannot be viewed, as in
   Mr. White's theory, as a mere external addition to a nature regarded as
   having originally no capacity or destination for it, a donum
   superadditum. It is impossible that a being should be capable of
   receiving the gift of immortality, who yet in the make and constitution
   of his nature gives no evidence that he was destined for immortality.
   Otherwise immortality loses all moral significance, and sinks to the
   level of a mere prolongation of existence, just as the life of the
   brute might be prolonged. Such evidence, if it exists, may not be
   sufficient to demonstrate man's immortality, but it will show that the
   make and constitution of his nature points in that direction, that
   immortality is the natural solution of the enigmas of his being, that
   without immortality he would be a riddle and contradiction to himself
   and an anomaly in the world which be inhabits. And are there pot such
   proofs?

   1. Our minds are arrested here, first, by the fact that nearly every
   tribe and people on the face of the earth, savage and civilised, has
   held in some form this belief in a future state of existence. This
   suggests that the belief is one which accords with the facts of human
   nature, and to which the mind is naturally led in its inquiries. Assume
   the doctrine to be false, there is still this fact to be accounted
   for--that nearly all tribes and families of mankind have gone on
   dreaming this strange dream of a life beyond the grave. [304] Mr.
   Spencer, of course, has a way of explaining this belief which would rob
   it of all its worth as evidence. The hypothesis is a very simple one.
   Belief in a future state, according to it, is simply a relic of
   superstition. It had its origin in the fancies of the savage, who, from
   the wanderings of his mind in sleep, and supposed appearances of the
   dead, aided by such facts as the reflection of his image on the water
   and the appearance of his shadow, imagined the existence of a soul, or
   double, separable from the body, and capable of surviving death. [305]
   Were I discussing this theory at length, I would like to put in a word
   for Mr. Spencer's savage. I would like to ask, first, Is Mr. Spencer so
   sure that this is the whole explanation of that singularly persistent
   instinct which leads even savage minds to cling so tenaciously to the
   idea of a future life? May it not be, though a philosopher may not care
   to take account of them,


   "That even in savage bosoms

   There are longings, yearnings, strivings,"

   For the good they comprehend not,"

   and that, sometimes at least,


   "the feeble hands and helpless,

   Groping blindly in the darkness,

   Touch God's right hand in that darkness,

   And are lifted up and strengthened!" [306]

   And I would like, secondly, to ask, Is the savage, after all, so
   illogical as Mr. Spencer would make him out to be? Allow that he has
   crude notions of apparitions and dreams, this is not the essential
   point. The essential point is that, from the activity of his mind in
   thinking and dreaming, he infers the working of a power within him
   distinct from his body. Is he so far wrong in this? I do not think we
   do justice always to the workings of the savage mind. [307] The savage
   knows, to begin with, that there is a something within him which
   thinks, feels, acts, and remembers. He does not need to wait on dreams
   to give him that knowledge. [308] The step is natural to distinguish
   this thinking something from his hands and head and body, which remain
   after its departure. [309] Going further, he peoples nature with
   spiritual agents after the type of the mind he finds within himself.
   Here, therefore, we have the clear yet not reasoned out distinction
   between body and spirit, and this, in connection with other hopes,
   instincts, and aspirations, readily gives birth to ideas of future
   continued existence. But, however it may be with the savage, how absurd
   it is for Mr. Spencer to assume that the mature and thinking portion of
   mankind have no better foundation for their belief than is implied in
   these vulgar superstitions which he names! You sit at the feet of a
   Plato, and see his keen intellect applied to this subject; you listen
   to the eloquence of a Cicero discoursing on it; [310] you are lifted up
   by the grand strains of the poets of immortality. You really thought
   that it was proof of the greater mental stature and calibre of these
   men that they speculated on such themes at all, and expressed
   themselves so nobly in regard to them. But it turns out you are
   mistaken. You and they have miserably deceived yourselves; and what
   seemed to you rational and ennobling belief is but the survival of
   superstitions, born of the dreams and ghost fancies of the untutored
   savage!

   2. But let us leave the savage, and look at this subject in the light
   of the higher considerations which have in all ages appealed with
   special force to the minds of rational men. I pass by here the
   metaphysical arguments, which at most are better fitted to remove bars
   to the acceptance of the doctrine than to furnish positive proofs of
   it. The real proofs are those which, as already said, show that the
   make and constitution of man's nature are not explicable on the
   hypothesis that he is destined only for a few short years of life on
   earth, but are such as point to a nobler and enduring state of
   existence. It is an interesting circumstance that Mr. J. S. Mill, who,
   in his treatment of this question, took evident delight in reducing the
   logical evidence to its minimum, yet practically brings all those
   arguments which he had thrust out by the door of the head back by the
   door of the heart, and uses them to found the duty of cherishing this
   hope of a future life. [311] What are these indications which point to
   a fitness for, and are a prophecy of, immortality in man?

   (1) There is the fact that the scale of man's nature is too large for
   his present scene of existence. I have already spoken of that shadow of
   infinitude in man which manifests itself in all his thoughts, his
   imaginations, his desires, etc. Look, first, at his rational
   constitution. In the ascent of the mountain of knowledge, is man ever
   satisfied? Does not every new height he reaches but reveal a higher
   height? Does not every new attainment but whet his appetite to attain
   more? Is any thirst more insatiable than the thirst for knowledge? Is
   it not the last confession of ripened wisdom that man as yet knows
   nothing as he would wish to know? Or look at the ideas which man's mind
   is capable of containing. His mind spans the physical universe, and
   ever as the telescope expands the horizon of knowledge, it reaches out
   in desire for a further flight. But there are greater ideas than even
   those of worlds and systems. His mind can take in the thought of God,
   of eternity, of infinity. Is this like the endowment. of a creature
   destined only for threescore years and ten? The same illimitableness
   attaches to imagination. "The use of this feigned history," says Lord
   Bacon, speaking of poetry, "is to give some shadow of satisfaction to
   the mind of man on those points wherein the nature of things doth deny
   it, the world being in proportion inferior to the soul; by reason
   whereof there is, agreeable to the spirit of man, a more ample
   greatness, a more exact goodness, and a more absolute variety than can
   be found in the nature of things." [312] Finally, there is desire. Give
   a man all of the world he asks for, and he is yet unsatisfied.


   "I cannot chain my soul; it will not rest

   In its clay prison, this most narrow sphere.

   It has strange powers, and feelings, and desires

   Which I cannot account for nor explain,

   But which I stifle not, being hound to trust

   All feelings equally, to hear all sides.

   Yet I cannot indulge them, and they live,

   Referring to some state of life unknown." [313]

   This argument is not met by saying, as Mill does, that there are many
   things we desire which we never get. This may be true, but the point is
   that even if we did get all the satisfaction which the earth could give
   us, our desires would still go beyond that earthly bound. [314]


   "And thus I know the earth is not my sphere,

   For I cannot so narrow be, but that

   I still exceed it." [315]

   The argument is further strengthened by comparing man with the other
   creatures that tenant the earth. Modern science justly lays stress on
   the constant relation subsisting between creatures and their
   environments. Throughout nature you find the most careful adjustment of
   faculty to environment. If there is a fin, there is water; if there is
   an eye, there is light; if there is a wing, there is air to cleave,
   etc. But here is a creature whose powers, whose capabilities, whose
   desires, stretch far beyond the terrestrial scene that would contain
   him! Must we not put him in a different category?

   (2) The same inference which follows from the scale of man's endowments
   results if we consider life from the point of view of moral discipline.
   Everything which strengthens our view of the world as a scene of moral
   government, everything which leads us to put a high value on character,
   and to believe that the Creator's main end in His dealings with man is
   to purify and develop character, strengthens also our belief in
   immortality. The only way we can conceive of the relation of nature to
   man, so as to put a rational meaning into it, is, as Kant has shown, to
   represent it to ourselves as a means to the end of his culture and
   morality. [316] Can we believe, then, that God will spend a lifetime in
   perfecting a character, developing and purifying it, as great souls
   always are developed, by sharp trial and discipline, till its very best
   has been evoked, only in the end to dash it again into nothingness?
   What would we think of an earthly artist who dealt thus with his works,
   spending a lifetime, e.g., on a block of marble, evolving from it a
   statue of faultless pro portions and classic grace, only in the end,
   just when his chisel was putting his last finishing touches on it, to
   seize his mallet and dash it again to pieces. It would stumble our
   faith in God--in the "Divine reasonableness" [317] --to believe that
   such could be His action.

   (3) A third consideration which points in the same direction is that
   frequently insisted on--the manifest incompleteness of the present
   scene of things, both as respects human character and work, and as
   respects the Divine administration. Here, again, everything that
   strengthens our faith in a moral government of the world, that
   impresses us with the infinite worth of human personality, that
   intensifies our sense of justice and injustice, forces on us the
   conviction that the present life, with its abounding anomalies,
   imperfections, and iniquities, is not God's last word to us; [318] that
   there is another chapter to our existence than that which closes on
   earth. Here comes in the consideration which Kant urges of the need of
   prolonged existence to complete the fulfilment of our moral destiny;
   [319] the sense of accountability which we all carry with us,
   instinctively anticipating a day of final reckoning; the feeling of an
   unredressed balance of wrong in the arrangements of life and society;
   above all, the sense of incompleteness which so often oppresses us when
   we see the wise and good cut down in the midst of their labours, and
   their life-work left unfinished. These are the "enigmas of life" for
   which it is difficult to see how any solution is provided if there is
   not a future state in which life's mysteries shall be made clear, its
   unredressed wrongs rectified, the righteousness of the good vindicated,
   and a completion granted to noble lives, broken off prematurely here.
   Our faith in God leads us again to trust Him, that "He that hath begun
   a good work" [320] in us will not leave it unfinished.

   (4) Finally, there is the fact which all history verifies, that only
   under the influence of this hope do the human faculties, even here,
   find their largest scope and play. This was the consideration which,
   more than any other, weighed with the late J. S. Mill, in inclining him
   to admit the hope of immortality. "The beneficial influence of such a
   hope," he says, in words well worth quoting, "is far from trifling. It
   makes life and human nature a far greater thing to the feelings, and
   gives greater strength as well as greater solemnity to all the
   sentiments which are awakened in us by our fellow-creatures, and by
   mankind at large. [321] It allays the sense of that irony of nature,
   which is so painfully felt when we see the exertions and sacrifices of
   a life culminating in the formation of a wise and noble mind, only to
   disappear from the world when the time has just arrived at which the
   world seems about to begin reaping the benefit of it. . . . But the
   benefit consists less in the presence of any specific hope than in the
   enlargement of the general scale of the feelings; the loftier
   aspirations being no longer kept down by a sense of the insignificance
   of human life--by the disastrous feeling of not worth while.'" [322]
   The evolutionist, it seems to me, should, beyond all others, respect
   these voices of the soul, this natural and unforced testimony of our
   nature to a life beyond, which does not disappear (as it would do were
   Mr. Spencer's hypothesis correct), but only grows clearer and more
   solemn, as the history of humanity advances.

   I think, then, we may conclude that reason does create a presumption,
   and that a very strong one, in favour of a future life. The
   considerations we have urged prove the possibility of immortality, and
   show that the soul of man is naturally fitted for immortality. We need
   not claim that they do more, though they have proved sufficient to
   inspire many of the noblest minds of our race, even apart from the
   gospel, with a very steady persuasion that there is a life hereafter.
   They cannot give absolute certainty. They may not be able, apart from
   the light of Revelation, to lift the mind wholly above the suspicion
   that the law of waste and destruction which prevails here against the
   body may somewhere else, and finally, prevail against the soul. But, so
   far as they go, they must be accepted as a powerful corroboration and
   confirmation, from the side of nature, of the Christian view.

   far as we can judge, a sporadic or abrupt act, and the substance
   produced, that is to say, the atoms which form the substratum of the
   present universe, bear (as Herschel and Clerk-Maxwell have well said),
   from their uniformity of constitution, all the marks of being
   manufactured articles."--P. 214.

   [223] This does not necessarily mean acceptance of the nebular theory
   of development. See Note B.--Evolution in Inorganic Nature--The Nebular
   Hypothesis.

   [224] Professor Clerk-Maxwell says: "This idea of a beginning is one
   which the physical researches of recent times have brought home to us,
   more than any observer of the course of scientific thought in former
   times would have had reason to expect."--Address to Math. and Phys.
   Sect. of Brit. Assoc., 1870.

   [228] Mr. Gore has said: "The term supernatural is purely relative to
   what at any particular stage of thought we mean by nature. Nature is a
   progressive development of life, and each new stage of life appears
   supernatural from the point of view of what lies below it."--The
   Incarnation (Bampton Lectures), p. 85. Lange has expanded the same
   thought. "Each stage of nature," he says, "prepares for a higher; which
   in turn maybe regarded as above nature, as contrary to nature, and yet
   as only higher nature, since it introduces a new and higher principle
   of life into the existent and natural order of things. . . . Thus the
   chemical principle appeared as a miracle in the elementary world, as
   introducing a new and higher life; similarly the principle of
   crystallisation is a miracle with reference to the lower principle of
   chemical affinity; the plant, a miracle above the crystal; the animal,
   a miracle in reference to the plant; and man, over all the animal
   world. Lastly, Christ, as the Second Man, the God-Man, is a miracle
   above all the world of the first man, who is of the earth
   earthy."--Com. on Matt. p. 152 (Eng. trans.).

   [229] Cf. Professor Flint, in Anti-Theistic Theories, pp. 438, 439. He
   remarks: "Although Omnipotence cannot express itself fully in the
   finite world to which we belong, the Divine nature may be in itself an
   infinite universe, where this and all other attributes can find
   complete expression. . . . The Divine nature must have in itself a
   plenitude of power and glory, to which the production of numberless
   worlds can add nothing."

   [230] This objection was early urged against the doctrine of creation.
   Cf. Origen, De Principiis, Book iii. 5; Augustine, De Civitate Dei,
   Book xi. 5.

   [231] See Note D.--"Eternal Creation."

   [232] Spinoza's Ethics, Part II. Prop. 44, Cor. ii.--"It is the nature
   of reason to perceive things sub quadam aeternitatis specie."

   [233] A good illustration is afforded by Mr. Green in a fragment on
   Immortality. "As a determination of thought," he says, "everything is
   eternal. What are we to say, then, to the extinct races of animals, the
   past formations of the earth? How can that which is extinct and past be
   eternal? . . . The process is eternal, and they as stages in it are so
   too. That which has passed away is only their false appearance of being
   independent entities, related only to themselves, as opposed to being
   stages, essentially related to a before and after. In other words,
   relatively to our temporal consciousness, which can only present one
   thing to itself at a time, and therefore supposes that when A follows
   B, B ceases to exist, they have perished; relatively to the thought
   which, as eternal, holds past, present, and future together, they are
   permanent; their very transitoriness is eternal."--Works, iii. p. 159.

   [234] Hegel, indeed, says: "Within the range of the finite we can never
   see that the end or aim has really been secured. The consummation of
   the infinite aim, therefore, consists merely in removing the illusion
   which makes it seem yet unaccomplished. . . . It is this illusion under
   which we live. . . . In the course of its process the Idea makes itself
   that illusion, by setting an antithesis to confront it; and its action
   consists in getting rid of the illusion which it has
   created."--Wallace's Logic of Hegel, p. 304.

     The Origin of Motion.

     The Appearance of Design in Nature.

   feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all
   their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges,
   . . . the chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain
   intellectually impassable."

   [269] Article on "Mr. Darwin's Critics," in Contemporary Review, Nov.
   1871, p. 464. Mr. Spencer expresses himself similarly: "Can the
   oscillation of a molecule," he says, "be represented in consciousness
   side by side with a nervous shock, and the two he recognised as one? No
   effort enables us to assimilate them."--Principles of Psychology, i.

   terrible matter,' except as a name for the unknown and hypothetical
   cause of states of our own consciousness?" ("On the Physical Basis of
   Life ") . . . it follows that what I term legitimate Materialism . . .
   is neither more nor less than a shorthand Idealism."--" On Descartes,"
   Lay Sermons, pp. 157, 374. On the relation of extreme Materialism to
   Idealism, cf. Kennedy's Natural Theology, pp. 64-66.

   [275] At least this terminology is held to be preferable. Prof. Huxley
   says: "In itself it is of little moment whether we express the
   phenomenon of matter in terms of spirit, or the phenomenon of spirit in
   terms of matter. . . . But, with a view to the progress of science, the
   materialistic terminology is in every way to he preferred."--Lay

   [282] "Motion," says Du Bois-Reymond, "can only produce motion, or
   transform itself into potential energy. Potential energy can only
   produce motion, maintain statical equilibrium, push, or pull. The
   sum-total of energy remains constantly the same. More or less than is
   determined by the law cannot happen in the material universe; the
   mechanical cause expends itself entirely in mechanical operations. Thus
   the intellectual occurrences which accompany the material occurrences
   in the brain are without an adequate cause as contemplated by our
   understanding. They stand outside the law of causality, and therefore
   are as incomprehensible as a mobile perpetuum would be. "--Ueber die
   Grenzen des Naturerkennens, p. 28 (in Kennedy's Natural Theology, p.
   48).

   appearing to ourselves such a unity, hut on our being able to appear to
   ourselves at all. . . . What a being appears to itself to be is not the
   important point; if it can appear anyhow to itself, or other things to
   it, it must be capable of unifying manifold phenomena in an absolute
   indivisibility of its. nature."--Microcosmus, p. 157.

   [293] The contrast is again marked with the attitude of the last
   century "Natural Religion," which regarded the "immortality of the
   soul" as one of its most certain articles. How little assurance even

   dust. The body, therefore, is seen to he destroyed. But there is
   nothing to prove that the agent within that body, who felt, who
   perceived, who thought and spoke, had likewise been destroyed, had
   died, putrefied, and fallen to dust. Hence the very natural conclusion
   that, though that agent had separated, it continued to exist somewhere,

   ready to help one another, so that at least life here below might be
   made as pleasant to all as possible, and kept free from evil. But, in
   truth, the opposite is the case. If the individual man is only a
   passing shadow, without any everlasting significance, then reflection
   quickly makes us decide: Since it is of no importance whether he exists
   or not, why should I deprive myself of anything to give it to him?

LECTURE V.

  THE POSTULATE OF THE CHRISTIAN VIEW IN REGARD TO THE SIN AND DISORDER OF THE
  WORLD.

   Christianity is the religion of Redemption. As such, it has for its
   third postulate the sin and disorder of the world. The existence of
   natural and moral evil is one of the darkest, deepest, and most
   difficult problems that can occupy human thought. It is one which has
   exercised the hearts of men in all ages, one which is often raised in
   Scripture, and which should warn us off from light and superficial
   views of the Divine character and purposes. Its presence is the great
   difficulty in the way of a belief on natural grounds in the perfect
   justice and goodness of God, the obstacle we immediately encounter when
   we try to persuade ourselves that the universe is created and ordered
   by a supremely good Being. So grave is this difficulty, even in respect
   to natural evil, that Mr. J. S. Mill declares "the problem of
   reconciling infinite benevolence and justice in the Creator of such a
   world as this" to be "impossible"; and adds, "The attempt to do so not
   only involves absolute contradiction in an intellectual point of view,
   but exhibits in excess the revolting spectacle of a jesuitical defence
   of moral enormities." [323] From the natural point of view, the
   assurance of God's perfect goodness must always be, to some extent, an
   act of faith, based on the postulate of our own moral consciousness;
   and even this will often find it difficult to sustain itself, since
   Christianity alone imparts the moral consciousness in sufficient
   strength to uphold the faith required.

   It is important to observe that, though this problem meets us in
   connection with the Christian view of the world, it is not Christianity
   that makes this problem. Natural and moral evil is there as a fact in
   the universe, and would be there though Christianity had never been
   heard of. Christianity intensifies the problem by the stronger light it
   casts on the character of God, and the higher view it gives of man, but
   it does not create the problem. What it professes to do is to help us
   to Solve it. But the problem is there all the while, and has to be
   taken account of by every system, whether Christian or not. It is a
   difficulty of philosophy, not less than of theology.

   While, however, in naturalistic systems moral evil is apt to fall
   behind natural evil, in Christianity it is the other way --the moral
   evil is throughout placed in the forefront, and natural evil is looked
   at mainly in the light of it. This is as it should be; for while, as we
   shall see, natural evil presents an independent problem, there can be
   no doubt that its existence is deeply implicated with the existence of
   moral evil. [324] If we subtract from the sum of suffering in the world
   all that is directly or indirectly caused by sin--by the play and
   action of forces that are morally evil--we shall reduce the problem to
   very manageable dimensions indeed. It is the existence moral evil which
   is the tremendous difficulty from a theistic point of view. I might go
   further, and say that it is only for a theistic system that the problem
   of moral evil properly exists. [325] Materialism and Pantheism may
   acknowledge natural evil--misfortune, pain, sorrow, misery--but it is
   only by an inconsistency they can speak of sin. Both are systems of
   determinism, and leave no place for moral action. There is, besides, in
   either system, no question of a theodicy, for there is to them no God.
   Things are as they are by a necessity of nature, which we can neither
   account for nor get behind. If we could, indeed, really get rid of the
   problem of sin by adopting either of these systems, there would be some
   reason for accepting them. But unfortunately the problem of moral evil
   is one which refuses to be thus summarily got rid of. Sin is there; the
   feeling of responsibility and of guilt is there; and neither the heart
   nor the reason of humanity will allow us to treat them as nonentities.
   Nor does the denial of God's existence really mitigate the difficulty.
   Dark as the problem of evil is, it would be immeasurably darker if we
   were compelled to believe that there is no infinite righteousness and
   love behind, through which a solution of the problem may ultimately be
   hoped for. I proceed to consider more narrowly what the Christian view
   of sin is, and how it stands related to modern theories and
   speculations.

    I. The problem of moral evil: conflict of Christian and modern views.

   I. It is in their respective relations to the sin and disorder of the
   world, perhaps more than at any other point, that the Christian and
   "modern" views of the world come to a direct issue. On the one hand,
   there are certain respects in which the Christian view finds unexpected
   support from the modern view of the world; on the other, there are
   certain respects in which it is fundamentally at variance with it. Let
   us briefly consider both.

   There are three respects, in particular, in which the modern view of
   the world comes to the support of the Christian view of sin.

   1. The modern view of things is marked by a stronger sense than in
   former times of the reality and universal presence of evil--both of
   natural evil and of moral evil, though moral evil, as was to be
   expected, is regarded more from its side of error, misery, and bondage,
   than from its side of guilt. The modern view has disposed of the
   superficial optimism of earlier times. The days of a flimsy optimism,
   when men demonstrated to their own satisfaction that this was the best
   of all possible worlds, and made light of the facts which contradicted
   their pleasing hypothesis, are over, and everywhere there is an
   oppressive sense of the weight of the evils which burden humanity, and
   of the unsatisfactoriness of natural existence generally. The strain of
   modern thought is pessimistic rather than optimistic. Its high-water
   mark is not optimism, but what George Eliot prefers to call
   "meliorism." [326] Herbert Spencer, indeed, still looks for an
   "evanescence of evil," as the result of the working of natural and
   necessary laws of evolution, [327] but I do not find that this
   represents the general temper of the age. Schopenhauer and Hartmann
   have at least this merit, that they raise the question of the good or
   evil of existence in a form which makes it impossible ever again to
   ignore it, or bury it out of sight. Pessimism, as Professor Flint has
   said, "like Macbeth, has murdered sleep." [328] All this is a gain to
   the Christian view. Hartmann even goes so far as to find the merit of
   Christianity in the fact that it is a system of Pessimism. [329] Both
   systems take for granted the facts of existence, and both look them
   boldly in the face. But there is this difference--Christianity looks on
   the world in a spirit of hope; Pessimism looks on it in a spirit of
   despair.

   2. It is an extension of the same remark to say that the modern view of
   the world has disposed effectually of the shallow Rousseau view of the
   inherent goodness of human nature, and of the eighteenth-century
   illumination dreams of a perfectibility of man based on education, and
   on altered social and political conditions. [330] The optimistic and
   Pelagian views of human nature are as completely discredited as the
   optimistic view of the world generally. Kant struck this deeper keynote
   when, in opposition to the preceding Rationalism, he acknowledged the
   presence of a "radical evil" in human nature, which he could only
   account for by an act of the will above time. [331] The modern
   evolutionary philosophy goes even beyond Christianity in its
   affirmation of the dominance of the brute element in man's being--of
   the ascendency of the egoistic over the social impulses in the natural
   man; [332] while the moralisation of humanity which it anticipates, in
   the sense of a gradual subordination of the former to the latter, is
   admitted to be yet very imperfect. From the side of modern thought,
   therefore, there is no hesitation in admitting, what Christianity also
   affirms, that the animal in man has an undue preponderance over the
   intellectual and spiritual; that the will, even in the best of men, is
   hampered and fettered by impulses of the lower nature to a degree which
   often evokes the liveliest expressions of shame and self-reproach; that
   society is largely ruled by egoistic passions and aims. The law in the
   members warring against the law in the mind [333] --in a sense, a
   natural depravity and "original sin "--has its recognition in modern
   science and philosophy.

   3. In the modern view of the world we have the fullest recognition of
   the organic principle in human life, and of the corollary of this in
   heredity. This, which is the correction of the individualistic view of
   human nature which prevailed in last century, I take to be one of the
   greatest gains of modern thought for the right understanding of the
   Christian doctrines both of sin and of Redemption. The Christian view
   is one which gives its rightful place alike to the individual, and to
   the organic connection of the individual with the race; and it is the
   latter side of the truth which modern thought has done so much to
   further. Rather, perhaps, I should say that both sides are being
   brought into strong prominence; for if there never was so much stress
   laid on the connection of the individual with society, neither was
   there ever so much said about individual rights. The former idea, at
   all events, is now thoroughly incorporated into modern habits of under
   the name of the "solidarity" of the race. [334] There is an individual
   life, and there is a social life in which we all share. The race is an
   organism, and the individual, if we may so speak, is a cell in the
   tissue of that organism, indissolubly connected for good or evil with
   the other cells in the unity of a common life. [335] From this follows
   the conception of heredity, which plays so important a part in modern
   theories. Man is not simply bound up with his fellows through the
   external usages and institutions of society. "He has been produced by,
   and has become a part of them, . . . he is organically related to all
   the members of the race, not only bone of their bone and flesh of their
   flesh, but mind of their mind." [336] He is a bundle of inherited.
   tendencies, and will in turn transmit his nature with its new marks of
   good an evil, to those who come after him. [337] It is easy to see that
   this conception of heredity, and of the organic unity of the race, is
   but the scientific expression of a doctrine which is fundamental to the
   Scriptures, and which underlies all its tea in about sin and salvation.

   In respect of the points just named, therefore, it may be affirmed that
   the modem view of the world is largely in agreement with Christianity.
   We may not agree with Schopenhauer and Hartmann that Christianity is a
   system of Pessimism; but we may admit that Pessimism, in so far as it
   recognises that the world is in an evil state, is far truer to facts
   and to Christianity than the superficial Optimism, the shallow
   perfectionism, and the Pelagian denial of original and inherited sin,
   which it helped to displace. In the respect last named, indeed, modern
   thought is nearer to Christianity than some Christian systems
   themselves. Ritschl, for example, teaches that sin consists only in
   acts, and not in states and dispositions of the heart; that there is no
   such thing as original or inherited sin; that sin is not transmissible
   by nature, but only through education, influence, the reciprocal action
   of individuals in society, etc. [338] But in maintaining this, he comes
   into conflict, not merely with texts of Scripture, but with the whole
   modern conception of the organic union of the race. Universal sin--sin
   which does not consist merely in acts but seated causes in the heart
   the effects of which both bodily and mental, are hereditarily
   transmitted--these I take to he conceptions which neither Ritschl nor
   any other will now be able to overthrow. [339]

   When all this is said, however, it must still be granted that the most
   fundamental difference exists between the two views--the Christian and
   the modern. The difference is partly one as to the nature of sin, and
   it runs up into a difference as to its origin. The Christian view of
   sin is not only infinitely deeper and more earnest than in any current
   conception apart from Christianity; but it is, as I formerly remarked,
   profoundly modified by the difference in the views of God and of man.
   The first thing we have to do here is to secure clearly the Christian
   idea of sin: then when we have done this, and asked whether it is
   verified in conscience and experience we are prepared to judge of
   theories of origin.

   I lay it down as a first principle that, in the Christian view, sin is
   that which absolutely ought not to be. [340] How that which absolutely
   ought not to be is yet permitted to exist under the government of a
   wise and holy God, is a problem we may not be able to solve; but the
   first thing to do is to hold firmly to the conception of sin itself.
   Sin, as such, is that which unconditionally ought not to be, which
   contradicts or infringes upon an unconditional law of right, and
   therefore can only be understood in the light of that which ought to
   be--of the moral good. [341] The Christian view of sin, accordingly,
   has for its presupposition the doctrine of God as ethical Personality,
   previously explained. It is God's perfect nature and holy will which
   form the norm of character and duty for man. The law of holiness
   requires, not only that the human will subsist in perfect harmony with
   the Divine, being surrendered to it in love, trust, and obedience, but,
   as involved in this, that there should be a right state of the
   affections, a pure and harmonious inner life. The external sphere for
   obedience is prescribed by our position in the world, and by our
   relation to it, to our neighbours, and to God.

   As the negation of this, sin, in the Biblical view, consists in the
   revolt of the creature will from its rightful allegiance to the
   sovereign will of God, and the setting up of a false independence, the
   substitution of a life-for-self for life-for-God. [342] How such an act
   should ever originate may again be a problem we cannot solve; but it is
   evidently included in the possibilities of human freedom. The
   possibility of sin arises from the fact that the creature has
   necessarily a relative independence and that in man, particularly,
   together with the impulse towards God, there exists an impulse towards
   the world, which the will may be tempted to make an object on its own
   account. [343] The false choice made. the spiritual bond between God
   and the soul is cut or at least infinitely weakened: the soul enters
   into subjection to the world to which it has surrendered itself, and an
   abnormal development begins, in which the baneful and God-negating
   character of the egoistic principle taken into the will gradually
   reveals itself. [344]

   While thus spiritual in its origin, as arising from the free act of a
   will up to that time pure, sin is anything but spiritual in its
   effects. Its immediate result is the subversion of the true relation of
   the natural and the spiritual in man's constitution, making that
   supreme which ought to be subordinate, and that subordinate which ought
   to be supreme. The relation of the spiritual and psychical in human
   nature is inverted. The spiritual is reduced to subjection, can at best
   make only feeble and ineffectual protests; the natural or psychical is
   elevated to authority and rule. Further, the spiritual bond being
   broken which kept the nature in harmony--reason, conscience, the
   God-ward affections ruling, while the lower passions and desires
   observed the bounds which higher law prescribed for them--not only is
   the psychical nature exalted to undue ascendency, but its own actings
   are now turbulent and irregular. It refuses to obey law; its desires
   clamour importunately each for its own special gratification; discord
   and division take the place of the normal unity. There is introduced
   into the soul a state of anomia--lawlessness. [345] Reason and
   conscience are still there as indestructible elements of human nature,
   nor can the sense of its dependence on God, or obligation to Him, ever
   be entirely lost. Hence arise, even in the natural man, conflict,
   struggle, self-condemnation, painful and ineffectual attempts to break
   the dominion of sin, never truly successful. [346] For this reason,
   that carnality preponderates in the nature of man as a whole, and that
   the most spiritual acts of the natural man betray the signs of its
   controlling influence, the whole man is spoken of as "in the flesh,"
   though elsewhere Paul distinguishes the flesh from that better
   self--the nous, or inner man--which protests against its rule. [347]
   All this finds its verification in conscience and experience, if not in
   its totality in every man's consciousness, yet in the general
   consciousness of the race. What a man's judgment of himself will be
   depends upon his standpoint, but in proportion to the depth of his
   self-knowledge he will confess that his heart is not naturally
   possessed by love to God, and by spiritual affections; that his inner
   life is not perfectly pure and harmonious; that there are principles in
   his heart at war with what duty and the law of God require; that he
   often transgresses the commandment which he recognises as "holy, and
   just, and good," [348] in thought and word and deed; and that, in all
   this, he lies under his own self-condemnation. He is conscious that the
   sin of his heart is such that he would not willingly lay bare its
   secrets to his closest intimate, and he would probably confess also
   that this state in which he finds himself did not spring wholly, or de
   novo, from his individual will, but that it developed from a nature in
   which the principle of disorder was already implanted.

   Gathering these observations to an issue, I conclude that the cardinal
   point in the Christian view of sin is, that it is not something
   natural, normal, and necessary, but, both as actual and as hereditary,
   something which must find its explanation in a free act of the
   creature, annulling the original relation of the creature to God. The
   Christian view, in other words, cannot be maintained on the hypothesis
   that man's existing state is his original one,--still less on the
   assumption that, in a moral respect, it is an advance and improvement
   on his original one, but only on the supposition that man has wilfully
   defaced the Divine image in which he was originally made and has
   voluntarily turned aside to evil. Apart from express statements on the
   subject, the underlying presupposition of the Christian view is that
   sin has a volitional cause, which, as the sin itself is universal, must
   be carried back to the beginning of the race--that, in other words, the
   development of the race has not been a natural and normal, but an
   abnormal and perverted one. And here it is, I admit, that the modern
   view of the world, with its doctrine of man's original brutishness, and
   his ascent by his own efforts to civilisation and moral life, comes
   into the most direct and absolute contradiction with it. Many
   attempts--some of them well meant--have been made to gloze over, or get
   rid of, this contradiction; but these would-be solutions all break on
   the fact that they make sin, or what passes for sin, a natural
   necessity; whereas, on the Biblical view, it is clearly not man's
   misfortune only, but his fault--a deep and terrible evil for which he
   is responsible.

   We shall best appreciate the force of this contradiction by looking at
   some of the theories to which the Christian view is opposed.

   1. First, we have a class of theories which seek the ground of evil in
   creation, or in the original constitution of the world; but these I do
   not dwell upon. Such is the theory of Buddhism, and of all the
   pessimistic systems. "The existence of the world," Schopenhauer holds,
   "is itself the greatest evil of all, and underlies all other evil, and
   similarly the root evil of each individual is his having come into the
   world"; [349] and Hartmann speaks of the "inexpiable crime" of
   creation. [350] Such, again, is the hypothesis of two original
   principles in creation, e.g., the Persian dualism, of which we see some
   faint attempts at a revival in modern times. [351] Such were the
   Platonic and Gnostic theories, that evil had its origin in matter. This
   doctrine also has its modern revivals. Even Rothe has adopted the view
   which seeks the origin of evil in matter, though why matter should be
   supposed inimical to goodness it is not easy to see. With him, it is
   the non-divine, the contradictory counterpart to God, opposed in its
   essence to the Divine, a conception not Biblical, and one which cannot
   be maintained. [352]

   2. We come, second, to a class of theories which seek the explanation
   of evil in the nature of man. It is the characteristic of all these
   theories that they regard sin as necessarily resulting from the
   constitution of human nature, in contrast with the Biblical view that
   it entered the world voluntarily. Of this class of theories, again, we
   have several kinds.

   (1) We have the metaphysical theories of sin--that, e.g., of Hegel. Sin
   is here regarded as a necessary stage in the development of spirit.
   Hegel is fond of explicating the story of Eden in the interests of his
   philosophy, and this is how he does it. "Knowledge, as the disannulling
   of the unity of nature," he says, "is the Fall,' which is no casual
   conception, but the eternal history of spirit. For the state of
   innocence, the paradisaical condition, is that of the brute. Paradise
   is a park, where only brutes, not men, can remain. . . . The fall is,
   therefore, the eternal mythus of man, in fact the very transition by
   which he becomes man." [353] Sin, in brief, is the first step of man
   out of his naturalness, and the only way in which he could take that
   step. It is the negation of the immediate unity of man with nature, and
   of the innocence of that pristine state, but only that the negation may
   be in turn negated, and the true destination of spirit realised. [354]

   (2) We have the ethical and would-be Christian forms of these theories,
   in which the subject is looked at from the religious point of view.
   Such, e.g., is the theory of Schleiermacher, who derives sin from a
   relative weakness of the spirit as compared with sense. [355] Such,
   again, is the theory of Lipsius, who explains it from the fact that man
   is at first a naturally conditioned and self-seeking being, while his
   moral will is only gradually developed. [356] Such is the theory of
   Ritschl, who connects it with man's ignorance. With him also man starts
   as a purely natural being, the subject of self-seeking desires, while
   his will for good is a "growing" quantity. [357] Sin, therefore, is an
   inevitable stage in his development.

   (3) We have the evolutionary theories, in which man begins only a shade
   removed from the brutes, and his subsequent moralisation is the result
   of slow development. This theory may be held in a more naturalistic or
   in a more philosophical form. In the former, the genesis of our moral
   ideas, from which the sense of sin arises, is sought in causes outside
   of the moral altogether--in the possession by man of social as well as
   egoistic impulses, in the perception of the advantage that would accrue
   from the subordination of the latter to the former, in the gradual
   accumulation of the results of experience in the organism through
   heredity, in the strengthening of the bonds of society through custom,
   law, etc. [358] What this theory fails to show is how this idea of the
   advantageous becomes converted into the perfectly distinct conception
   of the morally obligatory. A clearly perceived duty lays an obligation
   on the will quite distinct from a perceived advantage; and even
   supposing the discovery made that a larger good would accrue through
   every individual devoting himself to the common weal, a distinct notion
   is involved when it is perceived that duty requires us to adopt this
   for our end. [359] The higher form of the evolutionary theory,
   accordingly, makes a more promising beginning, in that it grants to man
   from the first his rational nature, and recognises that his ideas of
   moral truth and obligation spring directly from a rational source. It
   is held, however, as in the theories already considered, that at first
   it is the instinctive impulses, in which the self-regarding desires are
   necessarily preponderant, which hold the field, and that man comes to
   the knowledge of his true nature only gradually. Man, indeed, only
   begins to be a moral being when, through the awakening of his moral
   consciousness, he makes the discovery that he is not what, in the true
   idea of his personality, he ought to be--when he forms an ideal. It is
   this impulse to realise his true nature, to attain to moral freedom,
   and bring the self-seeking impulses into harmony with moral law, which,
   on this theory, constitutes the mainspring of all development and
   progress. [360]

   Taking this class of theories together, I contend that it is impossible
   to derive out of them conceptions of sin and guilt adequate to the
   Christian view. In the first place, it is evident that, in all these
   theories, sin is made something necessary--not simply something that
   might be, or could be, but an absolute necessity. In every one of them,
   the original condition of man is supposed to be such that sin could not
   but result from it. This, it seems to me, is practically to empty the
   idea of sin of its real significance, and to throw the responsibility
   of it directly back on the Creator. It is probably a feeling of this
   kind which leads many who favour the view we are considering to
   disclaim the word "necessity." Hegel, even, tells us that sin is not
   necessary; that man can- will evil, but is not under compulsion to will
   it. But this is a mere evasion, arising from an- ambiguous use of
   terms. In a multitude of other places Hegel tells us that sin arises
   from the highest logical and speculative necessity. [361]
   Schleiermacher, in like manner, disclaims the view that sin is a
   necessary law of human development. [362] He could not do otherwise,
   and hold, as he does the sinlessness of Christ. But he holds at the
   same time that the development through sin--or what we subjectively
   regard as sin--is the form of growth ordained for us by God, with a
   view to the ultimate Redemption, or perfecting, of the race in Christ.
   [363] Lipsius will have it that sin is at once necessary and free and
   avoidable. [364] Ritschl holds, in the same way, that a necessity of
   sinning can be derived neither from the outfit of human nature, nor
   from the ends of moral life, nor from a design of God. [365] Yet he
   grants, and starting off with man as he does as a merely natural being,
   he could not do otherwise, that sin is an apparently unavoidable
   product of the human will under the given conditions of its
   development. [366] All these theories in fact, therefore, however they
   may evade the use of the name, do make sin a necessity. In the
   evolutionary theories this is very obvious. There is here no pretence
   that a sinless development is possible. How is it conceivable that a
   being beginning at the stage of lowest savagery should avoid sin; and
   what responsibility can be supposed to attach to the acts of such a
   being, in whom brute passions and desires have full ascendency, while
   reason and conscience are yet a glimmer--a bare potentiality?

   One immediate effect of these theories, accordingly, is to weaken, if
   not entirely to destroy, the idea of guilt. How can man be held
   responsible for acts which the constitution of his nature and his
   environment--without the intervention of moral causes of any kind, such
   as is involved in the idea of a "Fall"--make inevitable? In all these
   theories I have named, accordingly, it will be found that there is a
   great weakening down of the idea of guilt. That man attributes his acts
   to him- self, and feels guilty on account of them, is, of course,
   admitted; but instead of guilt being regarded as something objectively
   real, which God as well as man is bound to take account of, it comes to
   be viewed as something clinging only to the subjective
   consciousness,--a subjective judgment which the sinner passes on
   himself, to which nothing actual corresponds. Redemption thus becomes,
   in theories that admit Redemption, not the removal of guilt, but of the
   consciousness of guilt; and this, not by any real Divine pardon, but by
   the sinner being brought to see that his guilty fears misrepresented
   the actual state of God's mind towards him. Thus it is in the theories
   of Schleiermacher, of Lipsius, and of Ritschl--in that of Ritschl most
   conspicuously. According to Schleiermacher, this subjective
   consciousness of guilt is a Divinely ordained thing to serve as a spur
   to make men seek Redemption, i.e. to be taken up into the perfect life
   of Christ. [367] Ritschl regards all sins as arising so much from
   ignorance as to be without real guilt in the eyes of God. God does not
   impute guilt on account of the ignorance in which we now live. The
   reason, therefore, why sins are pardonable is, that though the sinner
   imputes them to himself as offences, they are not properly sins at all,
   but acts done in ignorance. The guilt attaching to these acts is but a
   feeling in the sinner's own consciousness, separating him from God,
   which the revelation of God's Fatherly love in the Gospel enables him
   to overcome. [368] But I ask, Does this harmonise with the moral
   experience of the race--not to say with the statements of the Bible? Is
   it not the universal feeling of mankind that guilt is a terrible and
   stern reality, carrying with it objective and lasting effects, that it
   is as real as the "ought" is real, and that conscience, in passing
   judgment on our state, is but reflecting the judgment of God, to whom,
   ultimately, we are accountable? This weakening down and subjectivising
   of the idea of guilt is to me a strong condemnation of any theory from
   which it springs.

   These theories contradict the Christian view of sin, not simply in
   respect of its nature and of the degree of guilt attaching to it, but
   in the accounts they give of its origin. They regard that as a normal
   state for man in the beginning of his history, which the Christian view
   can only regard as an abnormal one. This is, indeed, the primary
   difference on which all the others depend. With minor differences,
   these theories all agree in regarding man's original condition as one
   but little removed from the brute; the animal impulses are powerful and
   ungoverned. Is this a state which, from the Christian point of view,
   can ever be regarded as normal? It may be a normal state for the
   animal--can it be a normal state for a moral personality? In such a
   being, even from the first, the moral law asks for a subordination of
   the animal impulses to reason and conscience, for unity, and not for
   disorganisation and lawlessness. It asks for this, not as something to
   be attained through ages of development, but as something which ought
   to exist now, and counts the being in a wrong moral state who does not
   possess it. What, according to these theories themselves, is the
   judgment which the individual, when moral consciousness awakes, passes
   on himself? Is it not that he is in a wrong moral state, a state in
   which he condemns himself, and feels shame at the thought of being in
   it? Else whence this sense of moral dissatisfaction, which it is
   acknowledged that he feels, and feels the more keenly in proportion as
   his moral perceptions become more acute? It is not simply that he has
   an ideal which he has not reached: this is an experience to be found in
   every stage of development, even when the conscience implies no blame.
   But the contrast is between the idea of the "is" and of the "ought to
   be," even in his present state, and this awakens the feeling of blame.
   [369] On what ground, further, must it be held that man must have
   commenced his career from this low and non-moral, if not positively
   immoral point? Is it a necessary part of a law of development, that a
   man can only reach that which he ought to be by passing through that
   which he ought not to be? Then evil has a relative justification, and
   the judgment which the immediate consciousness passes on it must be
   retracted or modified from a higher point of view. [370] We have only
   to compare the Christian estimate of sin with that to which this theory
   heads us, to see how profound is the difference between them. On this
   theory of development, when a man has reached the higher moral
   standpoint, he judges of his former state more leniently than he did at
   first; he ceases to pass condemnatory judgments on himself on account
   of it. In the Christian view, on the other hand, the higher the stage
   which a Christian man has reached, the evil and guilt of his former
   state will appear in a deeper dye; the more emphatically will he
   condemn it as one of lostness and shame. Which estimate is the more
   just? I do not think there is any difficulty, at least, in seeing which
   is most in accord with the idea of the moral.

   I cannot, therefore, think that the picture sometimes given us of man's
   primeval state--that of a miserable, half-starved, naked wretch, just
   emerged from the bestial condition, torn with fierce passions, and
   fighting his way among his compeers with low-browed cunning--is one in
   harmony with the Christian view. And the adversaries of the Christian
   faith not only admit the discrepancy between their view and ours, but
   glory in it. Christianity, they say, requires you to accept one view of
   man's origin, and science gives quite another. As it is sometimes put,
   the doctrine of Redemption rests on the doctrine of the Fall; and the
   doctrine of the Fall rests on the third chapter of Genesis. But science
   has exploded the third chapter of Genesis, so the whole structure falls
   to the ground. I acknowledge the issue, but it is not rightly put to
   say that the doctrine of the Fall rests on the third chapter of
   Genesis. The Christian doctrine of Redemption certainly does not rest
   on the narrative in Gen. iii., but it rests on the reality of the sin
   and guilt of the world, which would remain acts though the third
   chapter of Genesis never had been written. It would be truer to say
   that I believe in the third chapter of Genesis, or in the essential
   truth which it contains, because I believe in sin and Redemption, than
   to say that I believe in sin and Redemption because of the story of the
   Fall. [371] Put the third chapter of Genesis out of view, and you have
   the facts of the sin and disorder of the world to be accounted for, and
   dealt with, all the same.

   The question, however, arises, and it is a perfectly fair one to raise,
   Whatever we may say of the relation to the Christian view, is not this
   doctrine of man's origin, which implies a pure point of beginning in
   the history of the race, expressly contradicted by the facts of
   anthropology? Do not the facts of modern science compel us to adopt a
   different view? Must we not conclude, if regard is had to the evidence,
   that man did begin as a savage, but a few degrees removed from the
   brutes, and has only gradually worked his way upwards to his present
   condition? In answer I would say, I certainly do not believe that this
   theory has been proved, and, expressing my own opinion, I do not think
   it is likely to be proved. If it were proved, I admit that it would
   profoundly modify our whole conception of the Christian system.
   Negatively, evolutionists have not proved that this was the original
   state of man. The missing link between man and brute has long been
   sought for, but as yet has been sought in vain. The oldest specimens of
   men known to science are just as truly men as any of their successors.
   [372] At the same time, we need not reject the hypothesis of evolution
   within the limits in which science has really rendered it probable. The
   only theory of evolution which necessarily conflicts with the Biblical
   view is that which supposes evolution to proceed by slow and gradual
   modifications--"insensible gradations," as Mr. Spencer puts it--and
   this is a view to which many of the facts of science are themselves
   opposed. Evolution is not opposed to the appearance, at certain points
   in the chain of development, of something absolutely new, and it has
   already been mentioned that distinguished evolutionists, like Mr.
   Alfred Russel Wallace, freely recognise this fact. [373] The
   "insensible gradation" theory, as respects the transition from ape to
   man, has not a single fact to support it. With man, from the point of
   view of the Bible, we have the rise of a new kingdom, just as truly as
   when life first entered,--the entrance on the stage of nature of a
   being self-conscious, rational, and moral, a being made in the image of
   God, and it is arbitrary to assume that this new beginning will not be
   marked by differences which distinguish it from the introduction of
   purely animal races.

   The evidence which is adduced from other quarters of the originally
   savage state of man is equally inconclusive. There is no reason to
   believe that existing savage races represent the earliest condition of
   mankind; rather there is evidence to show that they represent a
   degradation from a higher state. The traces of early man which geology
   has disinterred show, indeed, the existence in various parts of the
   world of races in a comparatively rude and uncivilised state; but they
   are found mostly in outlying regions, far from the original centres of
   distribution, and afford no good evidence of what man was when he first
   appeared upon the earth. [374] On the other hand, when we turn to the
   regions which tradition points to as the cradle of the race, we find
   great empires and civilisations which show no traces of those gradual
   advances from savagery which the modern theory requires, but which
   represent man as from the earliest period as in possession of faculties
   of thought and action of a high order. [375] The theory, again, that
   man began with the lowest Fetishism in religion, and only gradually
   raised himself through Polytheism to Monotheism, finds no support from
   the history of religions. [376] There is not the slightest proof, e.g.,
   that the Vedic religion was developed out of fetish worship, or ghost
   worship, but many indications that it was preceded by a purer faith, in
   which the sense of the unity of God was not yet lost. The same may be
   said of the religions of the most ancient civilised peoples,--that
   while all, or nearly all, in the form in which we know them, are
   polytheistic and idolatrous, there is not any which does not show a
   substratum of monotheistic truth, and from which we cannot adduce many
   proofs of an earlier purer faith. [377]

   Another side from which the Christian view is contested, and the
   hypothesis of an originally savage condition of man is supposed to be
   supported, is the evidence that has been accumulated of an extreme
   antiquity of the human race. I am not aware that the Bible is committed
   to any definite date for the appearance of man upon the earth; but it
   will be generally felt that if the extreme views which some advocate on
   this subject, carrying back marks appearance some hundred thousand or
   two hundred thousand years, were accepted, it would, taken in
   connection with the comparatively recent origin of civilisation,
   militate against the view which we defended. I am free further to admit
   that, did no religious interest enter, and were the facts of science
   the only ones to be regarded, we would probably have been found
   yielding a ready assent to the hypothesis of a great antiquity. The
   religious interests at stake lead us, while of course acknowledging
   that whatever science really proves must be accepted as true, to be a
   little more careful in our examination of the proofs. And it is well we
   have been thus cautious; for, if we take the latest testimony of
   science as to what has been really proved, we find that the recent
   tendency is rather to retrench than to extend the enormous periods
   which were at first demanded; and that, while some geologists tell us
   that one or two hundred thousand years are needed, others, equally well
   informed, declare that ten thousand years would cover all the facts at
   present in evidence. [378] Professor Boyd Dawkins has said in a recent
   Address:--"The question of the antiquity of man is inseparably
   connected with the further question, Is it possible to measure the
   lapse of geological time in years? Various attempts have been made, and
   all, as it seems to me, have ended in failure. Till we know the rate of
   causation in the past, and until we can be sure that it is invariable
   and uninterrupted, I cannot see anything but failure in the future.
   Neither the rate of the erosion of the land by sub-aerial agencies, nor
   its destruction by oceanic currents, nor the rate of the deposit of
   stalagmite, or of the movement of the glaciers, have as yet given us
   anything at all approaching to a satisfactory date. We have only a
   sequence of events recorded in the rocks, with intervals the length of
   which we cannot measure. It is surely impossible to fix a date in term
   of years, either for the first appearance of man, or for any event
   outside the written record." [379]

   I claim, then, that so far as the evidence of science goes, the Bible
   doctrine of a pure beginning of the race is not overturned. I do not
   enter into the question of how we are to interpret the third chapter of
   Genesis,--whether as history or allegory or myth, or, most probably of
   all, as old tradition clothed in oriental allegorical dress,--but the
   truth embodied in that narrative, viz. the fall of man from an original
   state of purity, I take to be vital to the Christian view. On the other
   hand, we must beware, even while holding to the Biblical account, of
   putting into the original state of man more that the narrative
   warrants. The picture given us of the first man in the Bible is
   primitive in every way. The Adam of the book of Genesis is not a being
   of advanced intellectual attainments, or endowed with an intuitive
   knowledge of the various arts and sciences. If his state is far removed
   from that of the savage, it is equally far removed from that of the
   civilised man. [380] The earliest steps in what we call civilisation
   are of later date, and are duly recorded, though they belong, not to
   the race of Seth, but to that of Cain. [381] It is presumed that man
   had high and noble faculties, a pure and harmonious nature, rectitude
   of will, capability of understanding his Creator's instructions, and
   power to obey them. Beyond that we need not go. The essence of the
   Biblical view is summed up in the words of the Preacher: "God made man
   upright; but they sought out many inventions." [382]

    II. The problem of natural evil: connection with moral evil.

   II. I pass to the consideration of the connection of moral with natural
   evil, reserving for discussion in a succeeding section a special aspect
   of that connection--the relation of sin to death. I begin by a brief
   consideration of the problem of natural evil, as such. It is not sin
   only, but natural evil--the existence of pain and suffering in the
   world--which is made the ground of an impeachment of God's justice and
   goodness. Everyone will remember Mr. J. S. Mill's terrible indictment
   of nature on this score; [383] and Pessimism has given new voice to the
   plaints which have always been heard of the misery and suffering bound
   up with life, On the general question, I would only like again to
   emphasise what I said at the outset of the extent to which this problem
   of natural evil is bound up with that of sin. Apart from all
   theological prepossessions, we have only to cast our eyes abroad to see
   how large a part of the total difficulty this connection with moral
   evil covers. Take away from the history of humanity all the evils which
   have come on man through his own folly, sin, and vice; through the
   follies and vices of society; through tyranny, misgovernment, and
   oppression; through the cruelty and inhumanity of man to man; and how
   vast a portion of the problem of evil would already be solved! What
   myriads of lives have been sacrificed at the shrines of Bacchus and of
   lust; what untold misery has been inflicted on the race, to gratify the
   unscrupulous ambitions of ruthless conquerors; what tears and groans
   have sprung from the institution of slavery; what wretchedness is
   hourly inflicted on human hearts by domestic tyranny, private
   selfishness, the preying of the strong upon the weak, dishonesty and
   chicanery in society! If great civilisations have fallen, to what has
   the result been commonly due, if not to their own vices and
   corruptions, which sapped and destroyed their vigour, and made them an
   easy prey to ruder and stronger races? [384] If society witnesses great
   volcanic eruptions like the French Revolution, is it not when evil has
   reached such a height through the long-accumulating iniquities of
   centuries that it can no longer be borne, and the explosion effects a
   remedy which could not otherwise be achieved? If all the suffering and
   sorrow which follow directly or indirectly from human sin could be
   abstracted, what a happy world, after all, this would be! Yet there
   seem to be natural evils which are independent of sin, and we must
   endeavour to look the problem suggested by them fairly in the face.

   First of all, I would say that this problem of natural evil can hardly
   be said to meet us in the inorganic world at all, i.e. regarding it
   merely as such. [385] We see there what may appear to us like
   disharmony and disorder; convulsion, upheaval, the letting loose of
   titanic forces which work havoc and destruction; but except in relation
   to sentient existences, we cannot properly speak of these as evil. We
   may wonder why they should be, but when we see what ends are served in
   the economy of nature by this apparently lawless clash and conflict of
   forces, we may reconcile ourselves to it as part of a system, which, on
   the whole, is very good. [386]

   Neither does this problem properly meet us in connection with the
   organic world, so far as it is not sentient, e.g., in connection with
   the law of decay and death in the vegetable world. When it is said
   that, according to the Bible, there was no death before Adam, it is to
   be remembered that the Bible speaks of a vegetable creation, which was
   evidently intended to be perishable, [387] --which, in fact, was given
   for food to animals and men. We feel no difficulty in this. The plants
   are part of nature. They flower, seed, decay. They fall under the law
   of all finite, merely natural existences, in being subject to
   corruptibility and death.

   When we rise to animal life, the problem does appear, for here we have
   sentiency and suffering. Yet abstracting for a moment from this
   sentiency, the same thing applies to animals as to plants. They are
   finite, merely natural creatures, not ends in themselves, but
   subserving some general use in the economy of nature, and, by the law
   of their creation, exposed to corruption and death. flow is this
   modified by the fact of sentiency! I think we have only to look at the
   matter fairly to see that it is not modified in any way which is
   incompatible with the justice and goodness of the Creator. Leaving out
   of reckoning the pain of human life, and the sufferings inflicted on
   the animal world by man, we might fairly ask the pessimist to face the
   question, Is the world of sentient beings an unhappy one? Look at the
   fish in the stream, the bird in the air, the insect on the wing, the
   creatures of the forest,--is their lot one of greater pleasure or pain?
   I do not think it is unhappy. We speak of "the struggle for existence,"
   but is this necessarily pain? The capacity or pleasure, indeed, implies
   as its counterpart the susceptibility of pain, but whereas the avenues
   for pleasure are many, the experience of pain is minimised by the
   suddenness with which death comes, the absence of the power of
   reflection, the paralysis of feeling through fascination or excitement,
   etc. [388] I have been struck with observing the predominatingly
   optimistic way in which the Bible, and especially Jesus, all through
   regard the natural and sentient world, dwelling on its brightness, its
   beauty, its rejoicing, the care of Providence over the creatures, their
   happy freedom, [389] --in striking contrast with the morbid brooding
   over the aspects of struggle in nature which fill our modern treatises.
   [390] The thing which strikes us most as a difficulty, perhaps, is the
   universal preying of species on species --"nature red in tooth and
   claw" [391] --which seems so strange a feature in a government assumed
   to have for its motive beneficence. But the difficulty is modified by
   the consideration that food in some way must be provided for the
   creatures; and if sentiency is better than insentiency, greater
   beneficence is shown in giving the bird or insect its brief span of
   life than in with holding existence from it altogether. The present
   plan provides for the multiplication of sentient creatures. to an
   extent which would not be possible on any other system; it provides,
   too, since death must rule over such organisms, for their removal from
   nature in the way which least pollutes nature with. corruption. [392]

   The real question which underlies the problem in relation to the
   natural world is,--Is there to be room in the universe for any grades
   of existence short of the highest? In nature, as the evolutionist is
   fond of showing, we find every blank space filled--every corner and
   niche that would be otherwise empty occupied by some form of life. Why
   should it not be so? If, in addition to the higher orders of being,
   lower grades of sentient existence are possible, enhancing the total
   sum of life and happiness, why should they not also be created? Why--to
   give our thoughts for a moment the widest possible range--if there is
   in the universe, as Dorner supposes, "a world standing in the light of
   eternity, a world of pure spirits, withdrawn from all relation to
   succession" [393] (the angelic world), should there not be also a
   material and time-developing world? Why, in this temporal world, should
   there be only the highest creature, man, and not also an infinity of
   creatures under him, stocking the seas, rivers, plains, forests, and
   taking possession of every vacant opening and nook which present
   themselves? Or, in a developing world, could the highest be reached
   except through the lower--the spiritual except through the natural? Is
   not this the law of Scripture, as well as of nature--"that was not
   first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterwards
   that which is spiritual"? [394] The mere fact that in a world of this
   kind the denizens would be finite and perishable--exposed to incidental
   pains, as well as constituted for pleasures--would not be a reason for
   not creating it, unless the pains were a predominant feature, and
   constituted a surplusage over the pleasures. But this we do not
   acknowledge to be the case. The pleasures of the animal world we take
   to be the rule; the pains are the exception. [395]

   It is when we rise from the animal world to the consideration of
   natural evil in relation to man, that we first meet with the problem in
   a form which constitutes it a formidable difficulty. For man, unlike
   the animals, is an end to himself; pain means more to him than it does
   to them; death, in particular, seems a contradiction of his destiny;
   and it is not easy to understand why he should be placed in a world in
   which he is naturally, nay necessarily, exposed to these evils. The
   natural disturbances which we formerly noticed--floods, hurricanes,
   earthquakes, volcanoes, and the like--now assume a new aspect as
   elements in a world of which man is to be the inhabitant, and where he
   may be called upon to suffer through their agency. [396] This is really
   a serious problem, and we have to ask whether the Biblical view affords
   any clue to the solution of it, and whether that solution will sustain
   the test of reason and of fact?

   It is scarcely an adequate solution of this problem of natural evil and
   death as it affects man, though, no doubt, a profound element in the
   solution, to point to the disciplinary and other wholesome uses which
   misfortune and suffering are fitted to subserve in the moral education
   of man. This is the line followed by most earnest thinkers in trying to
   explain the mystery of suffering in the world, and it rests on the true
   thought that there is a Divinely ordained connection between the pains
   we are called upon to suffer and the ends of our highest life. [397]
   Without trials and difficulties, it is urged, where were progress?
   without checks to self-will, where were the lessons of submission to a
   higher will? without experience of resistance, where were the stimulus
   to effort? without danger and misfortune, where were courage, manhood,
   and endurance? without pain, where were sympathy? [398] without sorrow
   and distress, where would the opportunity for self-sacrifice be? This
   is quite true, but does it go to the root of the matter? Does it
   explain all? Because suffering and death, as existing in the world,
   have an educating and purifying effect; because, as may be freely
   granted, they have a power of developing a type of character greater
   and nobler than could have been developed without them (a glimpse of
   theodicy in the permission of evil at all); because they serve for
   purposes of test and trial where character is already formed, and aid
   its yet ampler growth [399] --does it follow that a world such as this,
   with its manifold disorders, would have been a suitable abode for an
   unfallen race; or that it would have been righteous to expose such a
   race to these calamities; or that, in the case of pure beings, less
   violent and painful methods of education would not have sufficed? [400]
   Of course, if this method of arguing were admitted, the existence of
   moral evils would have to be justified on the same ground, for in
   conflict with these, even more than with outward misfortune, is the
   highest type of character developed. It will be observed, also, that
   the argument rests largely, though not wholly, on the assumption of
   fault in human nature to be corrected (self-will, selfishness, etc.),
   and thus already presupposes sin; it does not, for instance, tell what
   a world would have been into which no sin had entered. But do even the
   advocates of this explanation of natural evil abide by their own
   thesis? Pain, it is said, begets tenderness and sympathy; suffering
   engenders philanthropy; the presence of evils in the world awakens
   noble self-sacrificing efforts for their removal--summons man, as
   Pfleiderer puts it, to fellowship with "the aim of God Himself, viz. to
   advance goodness, and to overcome evil in the world." [401] Then these
   are evils, and, notwithstanding their advantages, we are to treat them
   as things which would be better absent, and do our utmost to remove
   them. A concrete case in this connection is worth a good deal of
   argument, and I take it from Naville. He tells of a letter he received,
   written from Zurich, at a time when the cholera was ravaging the city.
   "My correspondent," he says, "told me that he had seen sad things--the
   results of selfishness and fear; but he also told me that so much
   courage, devotedness, and regard for the good of others had been
   brought out under the pressure of the malady, that different ranks of
   society had been so drawn together by the inspiration of generous
   sentiments, that he would not for the world have been absent from his
   native place, and so have missed witnessing such a spectacle." [402]
   Shall we then, because of these salutary effects, wish for the
   prevalence of cholera? Or because wars bring out noble examples of
   heroism, shall we desire to see wars prevail? The question has only to
   be asked to be answered, and it shows that this mode of justifying
   natural evil leaves much yet to be accounted for.

   It has just been seen that even this mode of explaining the existence
   of natural evil, and the use made of it in the moral government of God,
   presupposes, to some extent, the existence of sin. This yields a point
   of transition to the Biblical view, in which this solidarity of man
   with his outward world, and the consequent connection of natural with
   moral evil, is a central and undeniable feature. We are not, indeed, at
   liberty to trace a strict relation between the sins of individuals and
   the outward calamities that befall them; but Christ's warning on this
   subject by no means contradicts the view that there is an intimate
   connection between natural and moral evils, and that the former are
   often used by God as the punishment of the latter. It is one of the
   most deeply ingrained ideas in the Bible, that physical evils are often
   used by God for the punishment of individual and national wickedness,
   and Christ Himself expressly endorses this view in His own predictions
   of the approaching judgments on Jerusalem. [403] He warns us only that
   the proposition,--Sin is often punished with physical evils--is by no
   means convertible with the other,--All physical evils are the
   punishment of individual sins. Nor is this teaching of Scripture to be
   explained away, as it is by Lipsius, Pfleiderer, and Ritschl, as
   meaning merely that the evil conscience subjectively regards these
   visitations as retributive, though objectively they have no such
   character, but simply flow from the natural course of events. [404]
   Similarly, the expression, "All things work together for good to them
   that love God," [405] is explained as meaning that things work together
   for good to the believer, because, whatever the course of events, he is
   sure to profit by them. This is not the Biblical view, and it is not a
   reasonable one for those to take, who, like the above-named writers,
   admit a government of the world for moral ends. Once allow a relation
   between the natural and the moral in the government of God, and it is
   difficult to avoid the conclusion that the course of outward events is
   directed with a regard to the good and evil conduct of the subjects of
   that government.

   A deeper question, however, which lies behind this immediate one, of
   the place of natural evils in the moral government of God is, Is nature
   itself in a normal condition? The Bible, again, undeniably answers this
   question in the negative, and it is important for us to ascertain in
   what sense precisely it does so. The most explicit passage in the New
   Testament is perhaps that in Rom. viii. 19-23, where the Apostle Paul
   expressly declares, "For the earnest expectation of the creation
   waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was
   subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of Him who
   subjected it in hope that the creation itself also shall be delivered
   from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the
   children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and
   travaileth in pain together until now." The plain implication of this
   passage is that nature is a sufferer with man on account of sin; that,,
   as I expressed it above, there is a solidarity between man and the
   outward world, both in his Fall and his Redemption. So far the passage
   is an echo of the statement of Genesis, that the earth lies under a
   curse on account of human sin. Is this view scientifically tenable, or
   is it not a baseless dream, directly contradicted by the facts already
   conceded of physical disturbance, decay, and death in the world, long
   ere man appeared in it? I do not think it is. This implication of
   creation in the effects of human sin, though science certainly cannot
   prove it, is an idea by no means inadmissible, or in contradiction with
   known facts.

   1. The view has often been suggested--is maintained, e.g., by Dorner
   and Delitzsch [406] --that the constitution of nature had from the
   first a teleological relation to sin; that sin did not enter the world
   as an unforeseen accident, but, as foreseen, was provided for in the
   arrangements of the world; that creation, in other words, had from the
   beginning an anticipative reference to sin. This view would explain
   maw, things that seem mysterious inn the earlier stages of creation,
   and falls in with other truths of Scripture, to which attention will
   subsequently be directed. [407]

   2. I do not feel, however, that I need to avail myself of this
   hypothesis. All that is essential in the Apostle's statement can be
   conserved without going back to pre-Adamic ages, or to vegetable decay,
   and animal suffering and death. We gain the best key to the passage if
   we keep to the meaning of his own word "vanity" (mataio
   tes)--profitlessness-- as expressive of that to which creation was
   subjected. "It is not said," remarks Bishop Ellicott, "that the
   creation was subject to death or corruption, though both lie involved
   in the expression, but to something more frightfully generic, to
   something almost worse than non-existence,--to purposelessness, to an
   inability to realise its natural tendencies, and the ends for which it
   was called into being, to baffled endeavour and mocked expectations, to
   a blossoming and not bearing fruit, a pursuing and not attaining, yea,
   and as the analogies of the language of the original significantly
   imply, to a searching and never finding." [408] Thus interpreted, the
   apostleÂ¹s words convey the idea that nature is in a state of arrested
   development through sin, is frustrated of its true end, and has a
   destiny before it which sin does not permit it to attain. There is an
   arrest, delay, or back-putting through sin, which begets in the
   creature a sense of bondage, and an earnest longing for deliverance.
   [409] This certainly harmonises sufficiently well with the general
   impression nature makes upon us, which has found expression in the
   poetry and literature of all ages.

   3. The earth is under "bondage to corruption" in another way,--in the
   very presence of man and his sin upon it; in being the abode of a
   sinful race; in being compelled, through its laws and agencies, to
   subserve the purposes of manÂ¹s sin; in being perverted from its true
   uses in the service of his lusts and vices; in the suffering of the
   animal creation through his cruelty; in the blight, famine, earthquake,
   etc., to which it is subjected in consequence of his sin, and as the
   means of punishment of it. For it by not means follows that because
   these things were found in the world in the making, they were intended
   to be, or continue, in the world as made, or would have been found had
   sin not entered it. Science may affirm, it can certainly never prove,
   that the world is in a normal state in these respects, or that even
   under existing laws a better balance of harmony could not be
   maintained, had the Creator so willed it.

    III. Culmination of this problem in the question of the relation of sin to
    death.

   III. This whole discussion of the connection of natural with moral evil
   sums itself up in the consideration of one special problem, in which
   the contending views may be said to be brought to a distinct and
   decisive issue--I mean the relation of sin to death. Is human
   death--that crowning evil, which carries so many other sorrows in its
   train--the result of sin. or is it not? Here, again, it is hardly
   necessary for me to say, there is a direct contradiction between the
   Biblical and the "modern" view, and it is for us very carefully to
   inquire whether the Pauline statement, "Through one man sin entered
   into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all
   men, for that all have sinned," [410] enters into the essence of the
   Christian view, or whether, as some seem to think, it is an excrescence
   which may be stripped off.

   Now, so far from regarding this relation of human death to sin as a
   mere accident of the Christian view, which may be dropped without
   detriment to its substance, I am disposed to look on it as a truth most
   fundamental and vital--organically connected with the entire Christian
   system. Its importance comes out most clearly when we consider it in
   the light of the Christian doctrine of Redemption. The Bible, as we
   shall immediately see, knows nothing of an abstract immortality of the
   soul, as the schools speak of it; nor is its Redemption a Redemption of
   the soul only, but of the body as well. It is a Redemption of man in
   his whole complex personality--body and soul together. It was in the
   body that Christ rose from the dead; in the body that He has ascended
   to heaven; in the body that He lives and reigns there for evermore. It
   is His promise that, if He lives, we shall live also; [411] and this
   promise includes a pledge of the resurrection of the body. The truth
   which underlies this is, that death for man is an effect of sin. It did
   not lie in the Creator's original design for man that he should
   die,--that these two component parts of his nature, body and soul,
   should ever be violently disrupted and severed, as death now severs
   them. Death is an abnormal fact in the history of the race; and
   Redemption is, among other things, the undoing of this evil, and the
   restoration of man to his normal completeness as a personal being.

   That man was originally a mortal being neither follows from the fact of
   death as a law of the animal creation, nor from its present
   universality. It is, no doubt, an essential part of the modern
   anti-Christian view, that man is a dying creature, and always has been.
   This goes with the view that man is simply an evolution from the
   animal, and falls under the same law of death as the rest of the animal
   creation. But I have shown some reasons for not admitting the premiss,
   [412] and therefore I cannot assent to the conclusion. There is not a
   word in the Bible to indicate that in its view death entered the animal
   world as a consequence of the sin of man. But, with the advent of man
   upon the scene, there was, as remarked in an earlier part of the
   Lecture, the introduction of something new. There now appeared at the
   head of creation a moral and spiritual being--a being made in God's
   image--a rational and accountable being--a being for the first time
   capable of moral life, and bearing within him infinite possibilities of
   progress and happiness; and it does not follow that because mere
   animals are subject to a law of death, a being of this kind must be.
   More than this, it is the distinction of man from the animals that he
   is immortal, and they are not. He bears in his nature the various
   evidences that he has a destiny stretching out far into the
   future--into eternity; and many even, who hold that death is not a
   consequence of sin, do not dispute that his soul is immortal. But here
   is the difficulty in which such a view is involved. The soul is not the
   whole of the man. It is a false view of the constitution of human
   nature to regard the body as a mere appendage to the soul, or to
   suppose that the human being can be equally complete whether he has his
   body, or is deprived of it. This is not the Biblical view, nor, I
   venture to say, is it the view to which the facts of modern psychology
   and physiology point. If anything is evident, it is that soul and body
   are made for each other, that the perfect life for man is a corporeal
   one; that he is not pure spirit, but incorporated spirit. The soul is
   capable of separation from the body; but in that state it is in an
   imperfect and mutilated condition. Thus it is always represented in the
   Bible, and heathen feeling coincides with this view in its
   representations of the cheerless, sunless, joyless, ghost-like state of
   Hades. If, then, it is held that man was naturally constituted for
   immortality, how can it be maintained, with any show of consistency,
   that he stood originally under a law of death? That the animal should
   die is natural. But for the rational, moral agent, death is something
   unnatural--abnormal; the violent rupture, or separation, or tearing
   apart, so to speak, of two parts of his nature which, in the Creator's
   design, were never intended to be sundered. There is, therefore,
   profound truth in the Biblical representation, "In the day that thou
   eatest thereof thou shalt surely die"--"Dust thou art, and unto dust
   thou shalt return." [413] Some other way of leaving the world, no
   doubt, there would have been--some Enoch or Elijah-like translation, or
   gradual transformation of a lower corporeity into a higher, but not
   death as we know it. [414]

   The true Biblical doctrine of immortality, then, I think, includes the
   following points:--

   1. It rests on the Biblical doctrine of human nature. According to the
   Bible, and according to fact, man is a compound being--not, like God
   and the angels, a pure spirit, but an embodied spirit, a being made up
   of body and of soul. The soul, it is true, is the higher part of human
   nature, the seat of personality, and of mental, moral, and spiritual
   life. Yet it is intended and adapted for life in the body, and body and
   soul together make the man--the complete human being.

   2. It was no part of the Creator's design for man in his ideal
   constitution that body and soul should ever be separated. The
   immortality man was to enjoy was an immortality in which the body was
   to have its share. This is the profound truth in the teaching of the
   Bible when it says that, as respects man, death is the result of sin.
   Had sin not entered we must suppose that man--the complete man--would
   have enjoyed immortality; even his body, its energies replenished from
   vital forces from within, being exempt from decay, or at least not
   decaying till a new and more spiritual tenement for the soul had been
   prepared. With the entrance of sin, and departure of holiness from the
   soul, this condition ceased, and the body sank, as part of general
   nature, under the law of death.

   3. The soul in separation from the body is in a state of imperfection
   and mutilation. When a human being loses one of his limbs, we regard
   him as a mutilated being. Were he to lose all his limbs, we would
   regard him as worse mutilated still. So, when the soul is entirely
   denuded of its body, though consciousness and memory yet remain, it
   must still be regarded--and in the Bible is regarded--as subsisting in
   an imperfect condition, a condition of enfeebled life, diminished
   powers, restricted capacities of action--a state, in short, of
   deprivation. The man whose life is hid with Christ in God will no doubt
   with that life retain the blessedness that belongs to it even in the
   state of separation from the body--he will "be with Christ, which is
   far better"; [415] but it is still true that so long as he remains in
   that disembodied state, he wants part of himself, and cannot be
   perfectly blessed, as he will be after his body, in renewed and
   glorified form, is restored to him.

   4. The last point, therefore, in the Biblical doctrine is, that true
   immortality is through Redemption, and that this Redemption embraces
   the Resurrection of the body. [416] It is a complete Redemption, a
   Redemption of man in his whole personality, and not simply of a part of
   man. This is a subject which will be considered afterwards. It is
   enough for the present to have shown that the Biblical doctrines of
   man's nature, of the connection of sin and death, of Redemption, and of
   the true immortality, cohere together and form a unity--are of a piece.

   [330] Schopenhauer says: "Indeed, the fundamental characteristic and
   the proton pseudos of Rousseau's whole philosophy is this, that in the
   place of the Christian doctrine of original sin, and the original
   depravity of the human race, he puts an original goodness and unlimited
   perfectibility of it, which has only been led astray by civilisation

   [337] Perhaps the moat forcible illustrations of heredity are to be
   found in Maudsley's works." Most certain is it," he says, "that men are
   not bred well or ill by accident, little as they reck of it in
   practice, any more than are the animals, the select breeding of which
   they make such a careful study; that there are laws of hereditary
   action, working definitely in direct transmission of qualities, or
   indirectly through combinations and repulsions, neutralisations and
   modifications of qualities; and that it is by virtue of these laws
   determining the moral and physical constitution of every individual
   that a good result ensues in one case, a had result in another."--Body
   and Will, p. 248.

   propensity in the life of each individual," he says, "it originates, so

   which as such finds its adequate ground in the self-determination of
   the individual will"--P. 331.

   [339] Mr. J. J. Murphy says of Original Sin: "It is not a revealed
   doctrine, but an observed fact; a fact of all human experience, and
   witnessed to as strongly by classical as by Biblical writers, as
   strongly by heathens and atheists as by Christians."--Scientific Basis
   of Faith, p. 262. Pfleiderer speaks of "the undeniable fact of
   experience, that, from the very dawn of moral life, we find evil
   present in us as a power, the origin of which accordingly must be
   beyond the conscious exercise of our freedom," as "a fact on which
   indeterminism, Pelagian or rationalistic, must ever suffer
   shipwreck."--Religionsphilosophie, iv. p. 28 (Eng. trans.).

   [340] Hegel also uses this formula, but ambiguously. "What ought not to

   necessary point in human development, it is not on that account merely
   negative. . . . Evil in the course of development, or sin, is not in
   itself a condition of the development of the good; but it belongs to
   the idea of creation, as a creation out of nothing, that the created
   personality cannot detach itself from material nature otherwise than by
   being clothed upon with matter, and being in this way altered, rendered
   impure or sinful. This is the necessary commencement of the creation of
   man, but only its mere commencement, which comes to a close in the
   Second Adam. . . . The necessity of a transition through sin is not
   directly an ethical, but rather a physical necessity."The theory is

   [359] Mr. Stephen substitutes the "health" for the "happiness" of
   society as the moral end (p. 366).But the health is in order to the
   happiness, and it is presumed that the two tend to coincide (pp. 82,
   83). "Morality is a statement of the conditions of social welfare,"
   "the sum of the preservative instincts of society," "virtue is a
   condition of social welfare," etc. (p. 217). Strong in his criticism of
   the ordinary utilitarianism, Mr. Stephen is weak in his attempt to
   provide a substitute, or show how the moral can possibly arise out of
   the non-moral.See Mr. Sorley's criticism, Ethics of Naturalism, chap.
   viii.

   261-265 on "The Origin of the Bad Self": and Green's Prolegomena to

   the moral end in rational 'self-satisfaction,"--a conception into which
   it is difficult to avoid importing a subtle kind of hedonism; Bradley
   less objectionably finds it in "self-realisation"

   the consciousness of guilt as a power separating from God, . . . the
   certainty awakened in him by the Spirit of God present in man of his
   fellowship in life and love with God, as something graciously restored
   in him by God Himself."--P. 690.

   etc.See Note D.--Ritschl's Doctrine of Guilt.

   [369] Dorner truly says: "Evil does not consist in man's not yet being
   initially what he will one day become; for then evil must be called
   normal, and can only be esteemed exceptionable by an error. Evil is
   something different from mere development. . . . Evil is the discord of
   man with his idea, as, and so far as, that idea should be realised at
   the given moment. . . . Sin is not being imperfect at all, hut the
   contravention of what ought to be at a given moment, and of what can
   lay claim to unconditioned worth"--System of Doctrine, iii. pp. 36, 37.

   [370] Dorner says: "If evil is supposed to consist only in development,
   which God has willed in His character as Creator, then its absolute
   wrongfulness must come to an end The non-realisation of the idea cannot
   be blameworthy in itself, if the innate law of life itself prescribes
   progressiveness of development."--System of Doctrine, p. 264.

   [371] Cf. the suggestive remarks in Auberlen's The Divine Revelation,
   pp. 175-185 (Eng. trans.).

   [372] Professor Dana said, in 1875: "No remains of fossil man bear
   evidence to less perfect erectness of structure than in civilised man,
   or to any nearer approach to the man ape in essential characteristics.
   . . . This is the more extraordinary, in view of the fact that from the
   lowest limits in existing man there are all possible gradations up to
   the highest; while below that limit there is an abrupt fall to the ape
   level, in which the cubic capacity of the brain is one-half less. If
   the links ever existed, their annihilation, without trace, is so
   extremely improbable that it may be pronounced impossible. Until some
   are found, science cannot assert that they ever existed."--Geology, p.
   603. Virchow said, in 1879: " On the whole, we must readily acknowledge
   that all fossil type of a lower human development is absolutely
   wanting.Indeed, if we take the total of all fossil men that have been
   found hitherto and compare them with what the present offers, then we
   can maintain with certainty that among the present generation there is
   a much larger number of relatively low-type individuals than among the
   fossils hitherto known. . . . We cannot designate it as a revelation of
   science that man descended from the ape or any other animal."--Die
   Freiheit der Wissenschaft, pp. 29, 31. No new facts have been
   discovered since, requiring a modification of these statements.

   [373] Not only in respect of his mind, hut in respect also of his body,
   Mr. Wallace has contended that the appearance of man cannot he
   explained on Darwinian principles. He argues from the brain of
   primitive man as having a development beyond his actual attainments,
   suggesting the idea of "a surplusage of power; of an instrument beyond
   the wants of its possessor"; from his hairless back, "thus reversing
   the characteristics of all other mammalia"; from the peculiar
   construction of the foot and hand, the latter "containing latent
   capacities and powers which are unused by savages "; from the
   "wonderful power, range, flexibility, and sweetness of the musical
   sounds producible by the human larynx," etc.--Natural Selection, pp.

   viewed in relation to man. See below.

   [388] We may exaggerate, too, the power of sensibility in the lower
   species of animals.See on this, Mivart, Lessons from Nature, pp. 368,
   369. "Though, of course, animals feel, they do not know that they feel,
   nor reflect upon the sufferings they have had, or will have to endure.
   . . . If a wasp, while enjoying a meal of honey, has its slender waist
   suddenly snipped through and its whole abdomen cut away, it does not
   allow such a trifle for a moment to interrupt its pleasurable repast,
   but it continues to rapidly devour the savoury food, which escapes as
   rapidly from its mutilated thorax."--P. 369.

   reigns, a kind of fury which arms all creatures in mutua funera," etc.

   [392] Martineau says: "I will be content with a single question, How
   would you dispose of the dead animals . . . . If no creature would
   touch muscular fibre, or adipose tissue, or blood, and all animated
   nature had to he provided with cemeteries like ours, we should be
   baffled by an unmanageable problem; the streams would be poisoned, and
   the forests and the plains would be as noisome as the recent
   battlefield. Nature, in her predatory tribes, has appointed a sanitary
   commission, and in her carrion-feeders a burial board, far more
   effective than those which watch over our villages and cities."--Study
   of Religion, ii. p. 95. See his whole treatment of this problem.

   the idea of Aquinas of "a complete world, exhibiting without a break
   all possible forms of life."--P. 99.

   [394] 1 Cor. xv. 46.

   [395] The difficulty is "modified," as said, but not altogether
   removed, by these considerations, especially when the world is viewed
   in its teleological relations to man, and when stress is laid, not only
   on the mere fact of the preying of one creature on another, but on some
   of the kinds of creatures with which the earth is stocked, and on the
   manner of their warfare; on their hideousness, repulsiveness,
   fierceness, unnecessary cruelty, etc. See a powerful statement in
   Martensen's Jacob Bohme, pp. 217-222 (Eng. trans.).

   [396] To a certain extent these disturbances affect animals also, hut
   in these cases. the question is subordinate.

APPENDIX TO LECTURE V.

  THE OLD TESTAMENT DOCTRINE OF IMMORTALITY.

   The views advanced in the Lecture have an important bearing on the much
   discussed question of the Old Testament doctrine of immortality. The
   statement is often made that the Old Testament, especially in the older
   books, has no distinct doctrine of Immortality. Many explanations have
   been offered of this difficulty, but I would humbly suggest that the
   real explanation may be that we have been looking for evidence of that
   doctrine in a wrong direction. We have been looking for a doctrine of
   "the immortality of the soul" in the sense of the schools, whereas the
   real hope of patriarchs and saints, so far as they had one, was, in
   accordance with the Biblical doctrine already explained, that of
   restored life in the body. [417]

   The early Hebrews had no manner of doubt, any more than we have, that
   the soul, or spiritual part of man, survived the body. [418] It would
   be strange if they had, for every other ancient people is known to have
   had this belief. The Egyptians, e.g., taught that the dead descended to
   an under-world, where they were judged by Osiris and his forty-two
   assessors. [419] The Babylonians and Assyrians conceived of the abode
   of the dead as a great city having seven encircling walls, and a river
   flowing round or through it. [420] A name they gave to this city is
   believed by some to have been "Sheol," [421] the same word as the
   Hebrew Sheol, which is the name in the Old Testament for the place of
   departed spirits. It is one of the merits of the Revised Version that
   it has in many places (why not in all?) printed this word in the text,
   and tells the reader in the preface that "Sheol," sometimes in the Old
   Version translated "grave," sometimes "pit," sometimes "hell," means
   definitely "the abode of departed spirits, and corresponds to the Greek
   Hades,' or the under-world," and does not signify "the place of
   burial." But the thought of going to "Sheol" was no comfort to the good
   man. The gloomy associations of death hung over this abode; it was
   figured as a land of silence and forgetfulness; the warm and rich light
   of the upper-world was excluded from it; [422] no ray of gospel light
   had as yet been given to chase away its gloom. The idea of "Sheol" was
   thus not one which attracted, but one which repelled, the mind. Men
   shrank from it as we do from the breath and cool shades of the
   charnel-house. The saint, strong in his hope in God, might believe that
   God would not desert him even in "Sheol"; that His presence and
   fellowship would be given him even there; but it would only be in
   moments of strong faith he could thus triumph, and in hours of
   despondency the gloomiest thoughts were apt to come back on him. His
   real trust, so far as he was able to cherish one, was that God would
   not leave his soul in "Sheol," but would redeem him from that state,
   and restore him to life in the body. [423] His hope was for
   resurrection. To illustrate this state of feeling and belief, in regard
   to the state of the separate existence of the soul, it may be well to
   cite one or two passages bearing on the subject. An indication of a
   belief in a future state of the soul is found in an expression several
   times met with in Genesis--"gathered to his people"--where, in every
   instance, the gathering to the people (in "Sheol") is definitely
   distinguished from the act of burial. [424]

   Other evidences are afforded by the belief in necromancy, the
   narratives of resurrection, etc. What kind of place "Sheol" was to the
   popular imagination is well represented in the words of Job--


   "I go whence I shall not return,

   Even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death,

   A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself,

   A land of the shadow of death, without any order,

   And where light is as darkness." [425]

   There was not much cheer in looking forward to an abode like this, and
   it is therefore not surprising that even good men, in moments of
   despondency, when it seemed as if God's presence and favour were taken
   from them, should moan, as David did--


   "Return, O Lord, deliver my soul;

   Save me for Thy loving kindness' sake

   For in death there is no remembrance of Thee,

   In Sheol who shall give Thee thanks?" [426]

   or with Hezekiah--


   "Sheol cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee:

   They that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth.

   The living, the living, he shall praise Thee, as I do this day." [427]

   It is not, therefore, in this direction that we are to look for the
   positive and cheering side of the Old Testament hope of immortality,
   but in quite another. It is said we have no doctrine of Immortality in
   the Old Testament. But I reply, we have immortality at the very
   commencement--for man, as he came from the hands of his Creator, was
   made for immortal life. Man in Eden was immortal. He was intended to
   live, not to die. Then came sin, and with it death. Adam called his son
   Seth, and Seth called his son Enoch, which means "frail, mortal man."
   Seth himself died, his son died, his son's son died, and so the line of
   death goes on. Then comes an interruption, the intervention, as it
   were, of a higher law, a new inbreaking of immortality into a line of
   death. "Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him." [428]
   Enoch did not die. Every other life in that record ends with the
   statement, "and he died"; but Enoch's is given as an exception. He did
   not die, but God "took" him, i.e. without death. He simply "was not" on
   earth, but he "was" with God in another and invisible state of
   existence. [429] His case is thus in some respects the true type of all
   immortality, for it is an immortality of the true personality, in which
   the body has as real a share as the soul. It agrees with what I have
   advanced in the Lecture, that it is not an immortality of the soul only
   that the Bible speaks of that is left for the philosophers but an
   immortality of the whole person, body and soul together. Such is the
   Christian hope, and such, as I shall now try to show, was the Hebrew
   hope also.

   It is a current view that the doctrine of the Resurrection of the dead
   was a very late doctrine among the Hebrews, borrowed, as many think,
   from the Persians, during, or subsequent to, the Babylonian exile. Dr.
   Cheyne sees in it an effect of Zoroastrian influence on the religion of
   Israel. [430] My opinion, on the contrary, is that it is one of the
   very oldest doctrines in the Bible, the form, in fact, in which the
   hope of immortality was held, so far as it was held, from the days of
   the patriarchs downward. [431] In any case, it was a doctrine of very
   remote antiquity. We find traces of it in many ancient religions
   outside the Hebrew, an instructive testimony to the truth of the idea
   on which it rested. The Egyptians believed, e.g., that the reanimation
   of the body was essential to perfected existence; and this, according
   to some, was the thought that underlay the practice of embalming. [432]
   The ancient Babylonians and Assyrians also had the idea of
   resurrection. One of their hymns to Merodach celebrates him as the

     "Merciful one among the gods,

     Merciful one, who restores the dead to life." [433]

   The belief was probably also held by the Persians, though it is still a
   disputed question whether it is found in the older portions of the
   Zend-Avesta. That question is not so easily settled as Dr. Cheyne
   thinks; [434] but in any case the older references are few and
   ambiguous, and are totally inadequate to explain the remarkable
   prominence which this doctrine assumed in the Old Testament. [435] The
   Bible has a coherent and consistent doctrine of its own upon the
   subject, and is not dependent on doubtful allusions in Zoroastrian
   texts for its clear and bold statements of the final swallowing up of
   death in victory. Let me briefly review some of the lines of evidence.
   I have referred already to the case of Enoch in the beginning of the
   history, as illustrative of the Biblical idea of immortality. As
   respects the patriarchs, the references to their beliefs and hopes are
   necessarily few and inferential,--a fact which speaks strongly for the
   early date and genuineness of the tradition. The New Testament
   signalises them as men of "faith," and certainly their conduct is that
   of men who, accounting themselves "strangers and pilgrims" on the
   earth, look for a future fulfilment of the promises as of something in
   which they have a personal interest. [436] Not improbably it was some
   hope of resurrection which inspired (as with the Egyptians) their great
   care for their dead, and prompted the injunctions heft by Jacob and
   Joseph regarding the interment of their "bones" in the hand of promise.
   [437] It is significant that the Epistle to the Hebrews connects
   Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac with his faith in a resurrection. "By
   faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac . . . accounting that God
   is able to raise up, even from the dead; from whence also he did in a
   parable receive him back." [438] The Rabbis drew a curious inference
   from God's word to Abraham, "I will give to thee, and to thy seed after
   thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger." [439] "But it appears,"
   they argued, "that Abraham and the other patriarchs did not possess
   that land; therefore it is of necessity that they should be raised up
   to enjoy the good promises, else the promises of God should be vain and
   false. So that here we have a proof, not only of the immortality of the
   soul, but also of the foundation of the law--namely, the resurrection
   of the dead." [440] If this be thought fanciful, I would refer to the
   teaching of a greater than the Rabbis. Reasoning with the Sadducees,
   Jesus quotes that saying of God to Moses, "I am the God of Abraham, and
   the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob," adding, "God is not the God of
   the dead, but of the living." [441] The point to be observed is that
   Jesus quotes this passage, not simply in proof of the continued
   subsistence of the patriarchs in some state of being, but in proof of
   the resurrection of the dead. And how does it prove that? Only on the
   ground, which Jesus assumes, that the relation of the believer to God
   carries with it a whole immortality, and this, as we have seen, implies
   life in the body. If God is the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,
   this covenant relation pledges to these patriarchs not only continuance
   of existence, but Redemption from the power of death, i.e.
   resurrection.

   It is, however, when we come to the hater books--the Book of Job, the
   Psalms, the Prophets--that we get clearer light on the form which the
   hope of immortality assumed in the minds of Old Testament believers;
   and it may be affirmed with considerable confidence that this light is
   all, or nearly all, in favour of the identification of this hope with
   the hope of resurrection. I take first the Book of Job, because,
   whenever written, it relates to patriarchal times, or at least moves in
   patriarchal conditions. The first remarkable passage in this book is in
   chapter xiv. This chapter raises the very question we are now dealing
   with, and it is noteworthy that the form in which it does so is the
   possibility of bodily revival. First, Job enumerates the appearances
   which seem hostile to man's living again (vers. 7-12). Then faith,
   rising in her very extremity, reasserts herself against doubt and
   fear--


   "Oh that Thou wouldest hide me in Sheol

   That Thou wouldest keep me secret, till Thy wrath be past,

   That Thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!

   If a man die, shall he live again?

   All the days of my warfare would I wait,

   Till my release should come.

   Thou shouldest call, and I would answer Thee,

   Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of Thy hands." [442]

   There seems no reasonable room for question that what is before Job's
   mind here is the thought of resurrection. Dr. A. B. Davidson explains:
   "On this side death he has no hope of a return to God's favour. Hence,
   contemplating that he shall die under God's anger, his thought is that
   he might remain in Sheol till God's wrath be past, for He keepeth not
   His anger for ever; that God would appoint him a period to remain in
   death, and then remember him with returning mercy, and call him back
   again to His fellowship. But to his mind this involves a complete
   return to life again of the whole man (ver. 14), for in death there is
   no fellowship with God (Ps. vi. 5). Thus his solution, though it
   appears to his mind only as a momentary gleam of light, is broader than
   that of the Psalmist, and corresponds to that made known in subsequent
   revelation." [443]

   The second passage in Job is the well-known one in chapter xix.,
   translated in the Revised Version thus--


   "But I know that my Redeemer liveth,

   And that He shall stand up at the last upon the earth (Heb. dust].

   And after my skin bath been thus destroyed,

   Yet from my flesh shall I see God:

   Whom I shall see for myself,

   And mine eyes shall behold, and not another." [444]

   I do not enter into the many difficulties of this passage, but refer
   only to the crucial line, "Yet from my flesh shall I see God." The
   margin gives as another rendering, "without my flesh," but this is
   arrived at only as an interpretation of the word "from," which is
   literally the one used. The natural meaning would therefore seem to be,
   "Yet from (or out of) my flesh shall I see God," which implies that he
   will be clothed with flesh. [445] Dr. Davidson allows the admissibility
   of this rendering, and says: "If therefore we understand the words from
   my flesh' in the sense of in my flesh, we must suppose that Job
   anticipated being clothed in a new body after death. Something may be
   said for this view. Undoubtedly, in chapter xiv. 13 seq., Job clearly
   conceived the idea of being delivered from Sheol and living again, and
   fervently prayed that such a thing might be. And what he there ventured
   to long for, he might here speak of as a thing of which he was assured.
   No violence would be done to the line of thought in the book by this
   supposition." Yet he thinks "it is highly improbable that the great
   thought of the resurrection of the body could be referred to in a way
   so brief," and so prefers the rendering "without." [446] I think,
   however, this is hardly a sufficient reason to outweigh the
   tremendously strong fact that we have already this thought of
   resurrection conceded in chapter xiv., and, further, that the thought
   of living again in the body seemed the only way in which Job there
   could conceive the idea of immortality. If that is so, it may explain
   why more stress is not laid upon resurrection here. The hope which
   absorbs all Job's thought is that of "seeing God," and the fact that,
   if he does so at all, he must do it "in" or "from" the flesh, is taken
   for granted as a thing of course. [447]

   The question of the testimony of the Psalms is greatly simplified by
   the large concessions which writers hike Dr. Cheyne are now ready to
   make, in the belief that in the references to resurrection doctrine
   they have a proof of "Zoroastrian influences." The passages, however,
   are happily of an order that speak for themselves, and need no forcing
   to yield us their meaning. A conspicuous example is Ps. xvi. 8-11,
   cited in the New Testament as a prophecy of the resurrection of
   Christ--


   "I have set the Lord always before me;

   Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

   Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth;

   My flesh also shall dwell in safety (or confidently,

   For Thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol;

   Neither wilt Thou suffer Thins Holy One to see corruption (or the pit).

   Thou wilt show me the path of life:

   In Thy presence is fulness of joy;

   In Thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore." [448]

   Another passage is in Psalm xvii. 15, where, after describing the
   apparent prosperity of the wicked, the Psalmist says--


   "As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness:

   I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness."

   The "awakening" here, as Delitzsch says, can only be that from the
   sleep of death. [449] Yet more distinct is Ps. xlix. 14, 15--


   "They (the wicked) are appointed as a flock for Sheol;

   Death shall he their shepherd;

   And the upright shall have dominion over them in the moaning;

   And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, that there he no
   habitation for it.

   But God will redeem my soul from the power (hand) of Sheol;

   For He shall receive me.

   There is here again, it is believed, clear reference to the "morning"
   of the resurrection. The passage is the more significant that in the
   last words, as well as in Ps. lxxiii. 24, there is direct allusion to
   the case of Enoch. "God," says the Psalmist, "shall redeem my soul from
   the hand of Hades, for He shall take me," as He took Enoch, and as He
   took Elijah, to Himself." [450] Ps. lxxiii. 24 reads thus--


   "Nevertheless I am continually with Thee;

   Thou hast holden my right hand.

   Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel,

   And afterward receive me to glory.


   Whom have I in heaven but Thee?

   And there is none on the earth that I desire beside Thee.

   My flesh and my heart faileth;

   But God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever."

   These, and a few others, are the passages usually cited in favour of
   the doctrine of Immortality in the Book of Psalms, and it will be seen
   that in all of them this hope is clothed in a form which implies a
   resurrection. [451]

   I need not delay on the passages in the prophetic books, for here it is
   usually granted that the idea of resurrection is familiar. Not only is
   the restoration of the Jewish people frequently presented under this
   figure, but a time is coming when, for the Church as a whole, including
   the individuals in it, death shall be swallowed up in victory. We have
   a passage already in Hosea, which is beyond suspicion of Zoroastrian
   influence--


   "After two days will He revive us;

   On the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live before Him."

   And again--


   "I will ransom them from the power of Sheol;

   I will redeem them from death;

   O death, where are thy plagues?

   O grave, where is thy destruction?" [452]

   The climax of this class of passages is reached in Isa. xxv. 6-8, xxvi.
   19. Cf. also Ezek. xxxvii. 1-10, the vision of the dry bones. [453] The
   last Old Testament passage I will quote is an undisputed one, and has
   the special feature of interest that in it for the first time mention
   is made of the resurrection of the wicked as well as of the just. It is
   that in Dan. xii. 2--"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the
   earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
   everlasting contempt." This needs no comment.

   From the whole survey I think it will be evident that I was entitled to
   say that from the first the manner in which the hope of immortality was
   conceived by holy men in Israel was that of a resurrection. Yet, when
   all is said, we cannot but feel that it was but a hope--not resting on
   express revelation, but springing out of the consciousness of the
   indissoluble relation between God and the believing soul, and the
   conviction that God's Redemption will be a complete one. Life and
   immortality were not yet brought to light as they are now by Christ in
   His gospel. [454] The matter is unexceptionably stated by Dr. A. B.
   Davidson in the following words, with which I conclude; "The human
   spirit is conscious of fellowship with God; and this fellowship, from
   the nature of God, is a thing imperishable, and, in spite of
   obscurations, it must yet be fully manifested by God. This principle,
   grasped with convulsive earnestness in the prospect of death, became
   the Hebrew doctrine of Immortality. This doctrine was but the necessary
   corollary of religion. In this life the true relations of men to God
   were felt to be realised; and the Hebrew faith of immortality--never a
   belief in the mere existence of the soul after death, for the lowest
   superstition assumed this--was a faith that the dark and mysterious
   event of death would not interrupt the life of the person with God,
   enjoyed in this world. . . . The doctrine of Immortality in the Book
   (of Job) is the same as that of other parts of the Old Testament.
   Immortality is the corollary of religion. If there be religion--that
   is, if God be--there is immortality, not of the soul, but of the whole
   personal being of man (Ps. xvi. 9). This teaching of the whole Old
   Testament is expressed by our Lord with a surprising incisiveness in
   two sentences--I am the God of Abraham. God is not the God of the dead
   but of the living.'" [455]

   Note to Third Edition.--Believing that the tendency at present is to
   find too little rather than too much in the Old Testament, I leave this
   Appendix as it is. The recent work of Professor S. D. F. Salmond on
   Immortality--which for long will be the classic work on this
   subject--does not go so far in finding a doctrine of Resurrection in
   the Psalms as is done here, but it may be said at least that it lays
   down the premisses in its doctrines of God, and of man's origin,
   constitution, and destiny, which justify such an interpretation, and
   might easily have gone farther without inconsistency, or violation of
   sound exegesis. Accepting it as the Old Testament doctrine that man was
   created for immortality in body and soul in fellowship with God, that
   death is a penalty of sin, that fellowship with God contains the pledge
   of preservation from Sheol, or of rescue from it, which hopes are
   allowed to find expression in at least certain of the Psalms and in
   Job, and to take definite shape in the doctrine of Resurrection in the
   prophets, Professor Salmond's position does not differ very widely in
   principle from that indicated above. Enoch and Elijah are viewed as the
   type of immortality in Ps. xlix. and lxxiii., etc. It is difficult to
   see in what way this "postulate of faith" could shape itself, however
   vaguely, if not as a faith in a revived life in the body. If the Psalms
   came after the prophets, according to the modern theory, it is still
   more difficult to see how this hope should have shaped itself in the
   prophetic books, and not have exercised any influence upon the Psalms.
   Even the writer of the 16th Psalm can hardly have anticipated permanent
   exemption from death; his confidence, therefore, that in fellowship
   with God "soul and flesh, himself in his entire living being, shall
   continue secure" everlastingly, becomes unintelligible if his hope did
   not stretch. beyond death, and carry in it the assurance of a
   resurrection. Cf. specially pp. 193-197, 217-220, 238-255, 258 ff.

   final morning, which brings deliverance to the upright, and enables
   them to obtain dominion."

   [451] Or if not resurrection, then immortality in the body without
   tasting of death, as Enoch. But this is a hope the Old Testament
   believer could hardly have cherished for himself. The view of
   deliverance from death seems therefore the more probable in Ps. xlix.
   15, etc. A very different view is taken by Schultz in his
   Alttestamentliche Theologie, pp. 753-758. Schultz not only sees no
   proof of the resurrection in the passages we have quoted, but will not
   even allow that they have any reference to a future life. So extreme a
   view surely refutes itself. It is at least certain that if these
   passages teach a future life, it is a life in connection with the body.

   [453] On the passages in Isaiah, Cheyne remarks: "Instead of swallowing

   the true King, Jehovah."--Origin of Psalter, p. 402, Cf. Expository

   but "that the power of God can, against all human thought and hops,
   reanimate the dead, is the general idea of the passage, from which
   consequently the hope of a literal resurrection of the dead may
   naturally be inferred."--Oehler Theology of Old Testament, ii. p. 395

LECTURE VI.

  THE CENTRAL ASSERTION OF THE CHRISTIAN VIEW--THE INCARNATION OF GOD IN CHRIST.

    Introductory

   In the second Lecture I conducted an historical argument intended to
   show that there is really no intermediate position in which the mind
   can logically rest between the admission of a truly Divine Christ and a
   purely humanitarian view. This argument I have now to complete, by
   showing that the necessity which history declares to exist arises from
   the actual state of the facts in the Christian Revelation. We have seen
   what the alternative is, and we have now to ask why it is so.

   Why is it that we cannot rest in a conception of Christ as simply a
   prophet of a higher order? or as a God-filled man in whom the Divine
   dwelt as it dwells in no other? or as the central Personage of our
   race, at once ideal man and the Revelation to us of the absolute
   principles of religion? These views seem plausible; they are accepted
   by many; they seem at first sight to bring Christ nearer to us than on
   the supposition of His true God-manhood; why cannot the mind of the
   Church rest in them? Must not the explanation be that, taking into
   account the sum-total of the facts of Christianity, they refuse to
   square with any subordinate view, but compel us to press up to the
   higher conception? This is what I affirm, and I propose in this Lecture
   to test the question by an examination of the facts themselves.

   There is, I know, in some minds, an insuperable objection, a priori, to
   the acceptance of the fact of the Incarnation, arising from the
   lowliness of Christ's earthly origin and condition. Can we believe, it
   is said, that in this historical individual, Jesus of Nazareth--this
   son of a carpenter-God actually became incarnate; that in this humble
   man, so poor in all His earthly surroundings, there literally dwelt the
   fulness of the Godhead bodily? Is the thought not on the face of it
   incredible? The appeal here is to our powers of imagination--of
   conceiving--to our sense of the likelihood or unlikelihood of things;
   and to enable us to judge fairly of that appeal, and of its nature as
   an objection to the Incarnation, a great many things would have to be
   taken into account, both before and after. I would only say that, as
   regards a certain class who make that objection--the higher class of
   liberal theologians especially--the question seems only one of degree.
   If Christ is, in any ease, as most of them affirm, the central,
   typical, religiously greatest individual of the race; if the principle
   of the absolute religion is manifested in Him, as Pfleiderer allows;
   [456] if He is the ideally perfect man in whom the God-consciousness
   finds its fullest expression, as Schleiermacher declares; [457] if He
   is alone the sinless Personality of the race, as even Lipsius will
   grant, [458] --these are already remarkable claims, and, as compared
   with His lowly appearance and mean historical environment, create
   almost as great a feeling of strangeness as on the supposition of His
   true Divinity. Or let us suppose that the objection comes from the
   evolutionist. Then contrast the strangeness he speaks of with that of
   his own views. His objection is, that he cannot believe that in this
   lowly Man of Nazareth there should reside all the potentialities of
   Divinity. But what does he ask us to believe? He goes back to the
   primitive state of things, and there, in that little speck of jelly at
   the first dawn of life,--in that humble drop of protoplasmic matter
   buried in some oozy slime,--he bids us believe that there lies wrapped
   up, only waiting for development, the promise and potency of the whole
   subsequent evolution of life. In that first germ-cell there lies
   enfolded--latent--not only the whole wealth of vegetable existence, not
   only the long procession of future races and species of lower and
   higher animals, with their bodily powers and mental instincts, but, in
   addition, the later possibilities of humanity; all that has now come to
   light in human development--the wealth of genius, the riches of
   civilisation, the powers of intellect, imagination, and heart, the
   treasures of human love and goodness, of poetry and art--the genius of
   Dante, of Shakespeare, of Milton--the spiritual greatness and holiness
   of Christ Himself;--all, in a word, that has ever come out of man, is
   supposed by the evolutionist to have been potentially present from the
   first in that little primitive speck of protoplasm! [459] I confess
   that, putting his assertion alongside the Christian one, I do not feel
   that there is much to choose between them in point of strangeness. But
   evolution, he would tell us, is not deprived of its truth by the
   strangeness at first sight of its assertion--neither is the Christian
   view, The question is not one to be settled a priori, but to be brought
   to the test of facts.

    I. Testimony of the apostolic age as throwing light on Christ's own claims.

   I. Godet has said, "Christianity is entirely based upon Christ's
   consciousness of Himself, and it is the heroism of faith to rest upon
   the extraordinary testimony which this Being gave to Himself." [460]
   This must be so, for the reason which Christ Himself gives, that He
   alone has the knowledge which qualifies Him to give a true estimate of
   Himself. "For I know," He said to the Jews, "whence I came, and whither
   I go." [461] I propose, however, to begin at a point further down--that
   to which our first written documents belong--and to ask, What was the
   view of Christ's Person held in the apostolic age? The testimony of
   that age is clearly one of great importance, as throwing light on
   Christ's own claims. When men say, Buddha also was raised to the rank
   of Divinity by his followers, though he himself made no such claim, I
   answer that the cases are not parallel. It was only long centuries
   after his death, and within limited circles, that Buddha was regarded
   as Divine; but one short step takes us from the days when Christ
   Himself lived and taught on earth, into the midst of a Church, founded
   by His apostles, which in all its branches worshipped and adored Him as
   the veritable Son of God made manifest on earth for our salvation. If
   it can be shown that in the apostolic Church a practically consentient
   view existed of Christ's Person, this, of itself, is a strong reason
   for believing that it rested on claims made by Christ Himself, and rose
   naturally out of the facts of His historical self-manifestation. [462]

   I begin with the broad fact which none can dispute, that, in the first
   age of Christianity, Christ was universally regarded as one who had
   risen from the dead, who had ascended on high to the right hand of God,
   who exercised there a government of the world, who was to return again
   to judge the quick and dead, and who, on these grounds, was the object
   of worship and prayer in all the churches. [463] This view of Christ is
   found in every book of the New Testament,--in the Acts, in the Pauline
   Epistles, in Hebrews, in Peter, in the Book of Revelation, in the
   Epistles of John, and James, and Jude,--and is so generally
   acknowledged to be there, that I do not need to delay in quoting
   special texts. But even so much as this cannot be admitted, without
   implying that in the faith of the early Church Christ was no mere man,
   but a supernatural Personage, i.e. that the Ebionitic view was not the
   primitive one. Think only of what is implied in this one claim to be
   the Judge of the world--the arbiter of the everlasting destiny of
   mankind. [464] There is no point on which the writers of the New
   Testament are more absolutely unanimous than this--that Christ shall
   come again to be our Judge; and whether the early Christians analysed
   all that was involved in this belief or not, there can be no doubt in
   the mind of anyone who has analysed it that it involved the possession
   of attributes which can belong only to God (e.g., omniscience). Or take
   the other outstanding fact of worship paid to Christ--such, e.g., as we
   find in the Book of Revelation. The idea of Divine honours externally
   conferred on one who is essentially but man is quite foreign to the New
   Testament; and the only alternative is, to suppose that Christ was from
   the first regarded as having a supernatural and Divine side to His
   Person--as being essentially Divine.

   As regards the apostolic testimony, the ground is happily cleared in
   modern times by the large measure of general agreement which exists
   among impartial exegetes as to the nature of the doctrines taught in
   the several books. The old Unitarian glosses on passages which seemed
   to affirm the Divinity of Christ are now seldom met with; and it is
   freely admitted that the bulk of the New Testament writings teach a
   doctrine of Christ's Person practically as high as the Church has ever
   affirmed. For instance, it is no longer disputed by any competent
   authority that, in Paul and John, it is the supernatural view of
   Christ's Person that is given. As to John--using that name at present
   for the author of the Fourth Gospel and related Epistles--his doctrine
   of Christ is of the highest. This is admitted by the most negative
   critics, e.g., by Dr. Martineau, who says that the phrase "Son of God,"
   applied to the preexisting Word in the Fourth Gospel, heaves all finite
   analogies behind. "The oneness with God which it means to mark is not
   such resembling reflex of the Divine thought and character as men or
   angels may attain, but identity of essence, constituting Him not
   god-like alone, but God. Others may be children of God in a moral
   sense; but by this right of elemental nature, none but He; He is,
   herein, the only Son; so little separate, so close to the inner Divine
   life which He expresses, that He is in the bosom of the Father. This
   language undoubtedly describes a great deal more than such harmony of
   will and sympathy of affection as may subsist between finite obedience
   and its infinite Inspirer; it denotes two natures homogeneous, entirely
   one; and both so essential to the Godhead that neither can be omitted
   from any truth you speak of it. . . . It was one and the same Logos
   that in the beginning was with God, who in due time appeared in human
   form, and showed forth the Father's pure perfections in relation to
   mankind, who then returned to His eternal life, with the spiritual ties
   unbroken which He brought from His finished work." [465] In this
   Gospel, therefore, the question is not so much as to the doctrine
   taught, but as to whether the evangelist has given us an authentic
   record of what Christ said and did. On this question, so far as it is
   affected by the Christology, it will be well to reserve our judgment
   till we see whether the other writings of the apostolic age do not give
   us--or yield by implication--quite as high a view of Christ's Person as
   that which creates offence in John.

   To aid us in determining this question, there lie first to hand the
   writings, above alluded to, of the Apostle Paul. Here, again, it is not
   seriously doubted that in Paul's undisputed Epistles we have as clear
   and strong an assertion of Christ's Divine dignity as we could well
   desire. That, in Paul's theology, Christ had a heavenly pre-existence;
   [466] that the title "Son of God" applies to Him in this pre-existent
   state; that He was a being of Divine essence; that He mediated the
   creation of the world; that in the fulness of time He took on Him human
   nature; that now, since His death and resurrection, He has been exalted
   again to Divine power and glory--all this the most candid exegetes now
   admit. A new turn, however, has been given in recent years to this
   theology of Paul, by the fancy of some theologians that this heavenly,
   pre-existent essence of the earlier Pauline Epistles--the "Son of God"
   who became incarnate in Christ--is not a second Divine Person, as we
   understand that expression, but a pre-existent "heavenly man," a being
   apparently of subordinate rank, at once the perfect spiritual image of
   God and the heavenly prototype of humanity--a conception easier to
   state than to make intelligible. This "heavenly man" theory, as we may
   call it, has been seized on with avidity by many as the true key to the
   Pauline Christology. [467] Beyschlag of Halle adopts it as the basis of
   his own theory,--in this, however, differing from the others, that he
   attributes only an ideal pre-existence to this heavenly principle,
   [468] while the majority admit that what Paul had in view was a real
   and personal pre-existence. This whole hypothesis of the "heavenly man"
   I can only regard as a new-fangled conceit of exegesis, resting
   practically on one passage--that in which Paul speaks of "the second
   man from heaven," [469] --and in diametric opposition to the general
   teaching of the Epistles. It is an hypothesis, therefore, which finds
   no countenance from more sober expositors like Meyer, Weiss, or Reuss,
   all of whom recognise in Paul's "Son of God" a Being truly Divine.
   [470] Christ indeed, in Paul's view, has humanity, but it is not a
   humanity which He brought with Him from heaven, but a humanity which He
   assumed when He came to earth.

   The argument for the "heavenly man" theory completely breaks down if we
   take into account the later Epistles--especially Philippians,
   Ephesians, and Colossians, the genuineness of which there are no good
   grounds for disputing. [471] Pfleiderer, who advocates this theory,
   admits the genuineness of the Epistle to the Philippians, but there we
   have the strongest assertion of Christ's pre-existent Divinity. The
   whole argument in chap. ii. 5-11 turns on Christ's original condition
   of Divine glory--" being in the form of God"--and His voluntary
   abdication of it to take upon. Him "the form of a servant"--"being made
   in the likeness of men"--"being found in fashion as a man." [472] As to
   the teaching of the Epistles to the Colossians and the Ephesians, there
   is no dispute, even among the friends of this theory. In these
   Epistles, says Lipsius, "Christ, as the image of God and the first-born
   of the whole creation, is an essentially Divine Personality, and the
   Mediator of the creation of the world." [473] Pfleiderer sees, or
   imagines he sees, in them the same influence of the Philonic Logos
   doctrine as is traceable in the Gospel of John [474] --an indirect
   witness that between the theology of Paul in these Epistles and that of
   the Fourth Gospel there is no essential difference. But though the
   Christology of the later Epistles is admittedly more developed than
   that of the earlier Epistles, the doctrine of Christ in both is
   substantially one. [475] In both, Christ was "the Son of God,"
   eternally pre-existing in a state of glory with the Father, who, in the
   fulness of time, moved by love, became incarnate for our salvation.
   [476] In both--as also in John--He existed before the creation of the
   world, and was the agent in its creation. [477] That He is the centre
   of the Divine purpose, and therefore the One for whom all things as
   well as by whom all things, are made, is a doctrine as clearly taught
   in the Epistles to the Romans and the Corinthians as in those to the
   Colossians and the Ephesians. [478] In both, the Divine name Kurios is
   freely given to Him; passages applied in the Old Testament to Jehovah
   are applied to Him also; Divine honour is paid to Him; He is exalted to
   a Divine sovereignty of the world; [479] His name is constantly joined
   with that of the Father as the source of grace and peace in the
   introductions to the Epistles, [480] and again with those of the Father
   and of the Spirit in the apostolic benediction; [481] it is declared of
   Him that, as Judge, He has the attribute of the Divine searcher of
   hearts. [482] Taking all the facts into account, and remembering how
   inconsonant it would have been with Paul's rigorous Monotheism to
   attribute Divine honours to a Being not truly Divine, it seems
   impossible to doubt that, in the view of the Apostle, Christ was truly
   a Divine Person, one in essence, though distinct in Person from the
   Father. [483] But the most remarkable circumstance of all is--and it is
   a point which I desire specially to emphasise--that in propounding
   these high views of Christ's Person, Paul in no case speaks or argues
   as one teaching a new doctrine, but throughout takes it for granted
   that his reader's estimate of the Lord's dignity is the same as his
   own. He gives no indication in these letters that he preached or
   contended for a higher view of Christ's Person than that which was
   currently received. [484] He has no monopoly of this truth, but assumes
   it as the common possession of the Church. He argues at length for the
   doctrine of justification by faith, but we never find him arguing for
   the Divinity of Christ. Whether writing to his own converts, or to
   churches he had never seen, he uses the same language on this subject,
   and apparently anticipates no doubt or contradiction on the part of his
   readers. What inference can we draw, but that the doctrine of Christ's
   Person in the early Church was anything but Ebionitic,--that from the
   first a Divine dignity was ascribed to Christ?

   Paul's Epistles, however, are not the only witnesses on this point of
   Apostolic theology. Essentially the same doctrine we find in the
   Epistle to the Hebrews, long attributed to Paul, but now almost
   universally assigned to another author. It has, therefore, the value of
   an independent witness. The Epistle is further valuable for its early
   date, most critics unhesitatingly referring it to the period before the
   destruction of Jerusalem, probably about A.D. 66. [485] But here,
   though the writer's stand- point is somewhat different from both Paul's
   and John's, we find precisely the same doctrine as before,--Jesus, the
   Divine Son of God, the effulgence of the Father's glory and very image
   of His substance, the creator, upholder, and heir of all things, who,
   because the children were partakers of flesh and blood, Himself
   likewise partook of the same, and is now again exalted to the right
   hand of the Majesty on high. [486] Further, in teaching this high
   Christological view, the author is not conscious any more than Paul of
   bringing in a new doctrine. He stands rather upon the ground of the
   common Christian confession, which he exhorts the Hebrews to hold fast.
   [487]

   It is conceded, however, that in the main the Christology of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews is of the Pauline type, and the question
   arises--Have we anywhere a witness of another type, showing how the
   Person of Christ was viewed in the distinctively Jewish, as contrasted
   with the Gentile sections of the Church? The answer is given in another
   book of the apostolic age, the early date of which is one of the
   articles of the modern creed, and which is supposed by some--e.g., by
   Volkmar--to have been written expressly with the view of opposing Paul.
   [488] I refer to the Apocalypse. By general consent of the modem school
   of critics, this book was composed immediately after the death of Nero,
   [489] and its anti-Pauline character is not only admitted, but insisted
   on. Here, then, we have what may be regarded as a representative early
   Jewish-Christian writing; and the question is of deep interest, What
   kind of view of Christ's Person do we find in it? And the answer must
   be given that the doctrine of Christ in the Apocalypse is as high, or
   nearly as high, as it is in either Paul or John. Reuss, who is
   certainly an unprejudiced witness, has some remarks here which are
   worth quoting as corroborative of the previous line of argument. "We
   may here observe," he says, "that the writings of Paul, which carry us
   back, so to speak, into the very cradle of the Church, contain nothing
   to indicate that their Christological doctrine, so different from that
   of common Ebionitism, was regarded as an innovation, or gave rise to
   any disputations at the time of its first appearance. But we have in
   our hands another book, essentially Judaeo-Christian, which gives
   emphatic support to our assertion. This is the Book of Revelation.
   . . . It ought unhesitatingly to be acknowledged that Christ is placed
   in the Revelation on a par with God. He is called the First and the
   Last, the Beginning and the End, and these same expressions are used to
   designate the Most High." [490] Professor Pfleiderer is another critic
   who puts this point so strongly and unambiguously, that I cannot do
   better than give his words. "As, according to Paul," he says, "Christ
   has been exalted to the regal dignity of Divine dominion over all, so,
   according to our author, He has taken His seat on the throne by the
   side of His Father, participating therefore in His Divine dominion and
   power--He is the Lord of the churches, holds their stars, or guardian
   angels, in His hand, and is also Ruler of nations and King of kings,
   the all-wise and almighty Judge of the nations; indeed, to Him is due a
   worship similar to that of God Himself. As the author of the
   Apocalypse, in his apotheosis of Christ as an object of worship, thus
   almost outstrips Paul, neither does he in his dogmatic definitions of
   Christ's nature at all fall behind the Apostle. Like Paul, he calls
   Christ the 'son of God' in the metaphysical sense of a godlike
   spiritual being, and far beyond the merely theocratic significance of
   the title. . . . As Paul had described the celestial Son of Man as at
   the same time the image of God, the agent of creation, the head of
   every man, and finally even God over all, so the Christ of the
   Apocalypse introduces Himself with the predicates of Divine majesty: I
   am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is, and who was,
   and who is to come, the All-powerful'; and He is accordingly called
   also the Head of Creation,' and the Word of God,' that is, the
   mediating instrument of all Divine Revelation from the creation of the
   world to the final judgment. It appears from this that the similarity
   of the Christology of the Apocalypse to that of Paul is complete; this
   Christ occupies the same exalted position as the Pauline Christ above
   the terrestrial Son of Man." [491]

   It is not necessary, after these examples, that I should dwell long on
   the Christology of the Petrine and minor Epistles. Peter is again a
   distinct witness, and his testimony is in harmony with what we have
   already seen. Christ is, to refer only to the First Epistle, joined
   with the Father and the Spirit as one of the principals in the work of
   salvation; [492] He is the Redeemer, foreordained before the foundation
   of the world, but manifest in these last times; [493] His Spirit
   testified beforehand in the prophets; [494] He is called Kurios, and
   passages used in the Old Testament of Jehovah are applied to
   Him--remarkably in chap. iii. 15, "Sanctify in your hearts Christ as
   Lord"; [495] He has gone into heaven, and is at the right hand of God,
   angels and authorities and powers being made subject to Him; [496] He
   is the ordained Judge of quick and dead. [497] He is therefore, as
   Weiss says, in His exaltation a Divine Being, [498] whether the Epistle
   directly teaches His pre-existence or not, as, however, Pfleiderer
   thinks it does. [499] Even James, who barely touches Christology in his
   Epistle, speaks of Christ as the "Lord of Glory," and the Judge of the
   world, and prayer is to be made in His name. [500] Not less instructive
   are the references in the brief Epistle of Jude, who describes Jesus as
   "our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ"; who exhorts believers to pray
   in the Holy Spirit, and keep themselves in the love of God, hooking for
   the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ; and who concludes his short letter
   by ascribing to the only God, our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our
   Lord, glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, and now,
   and for evermore. [501] If to these sources of evidence we add the
   popular discourses in the Acts of the Apostles, we shall have a
   tolerably clear idea of the views of Christ held in the Church in the
   earliest period of Christianity. These discourses, though, as might be
   expected, containing little or no dogmatic teaching on the origin or
   constitution of Christ's Person, yet do not fail to represent Him as
   possessing a unique dignity; [502] as the holy and sinless One, whom it
   was not possible for death to hold; [503] as the Prince of Life,
   exalted to the throne of universal dominion; [504] as the Lord on whose
   name men were to call, the One in whom alone under heaven there was
   salvation, and through whom was preached forgiveness of sins to men;
   [505] as the Giver of the Holy Ghost [506] as the appointed Judge of
   the world, whom the heaven must retain till the time of the restitution
   of all things. [507] These representations, though simpler, are not
   inconsistent with the more developed Christology of the Epistles, but
   rather furnish the data or premises from which all the positions of
   that Christology can be deduced. [508]

   The supernatural view of Christ, then, is no late development, but was
   in all its leading features fully established in the Church in the
   generation immediately succeeding Christ's death. We find it
   presupposed in all the apostolic writings, and assumed as well known
   among the persons to whom these writings were addressed. If there were,
   as the TÃ¼bingen school alleges, Pauline and Petrine parties in the
   Church, it was held by both of these; whatever other shades of
   doctrinal opinion existed, this was a common element. But this, it
   seems to me, is only conceivable on the supposition that the view in
   question was in harmony with the facts of Christ's own life on earth,
   with the Claims He made, and with the testimony which His apostles had
   deposited in the various churches regarding Him. We are now to see how
   far this is borne out by the actual records we possess of Christ's
   life.

    II. The testimony of the Gospels--Christ in the Fourth Gospel.

   II. We go back then to the Gospels, and ask what they teach. Here I
   leave out of view the Fourth Gospel, about the teaching of which there
   can be little possible dispute. Not simply the prologue, but the acts
   and sayings of Christ recorded in that Gospel, are decisive for anyone
   who admits it, as I do, to be a truthful record by the beloved disciple
   of what Christ did and said on earth. [509] It would be out of place
   here to discuss the question of the genuineness. I would only say that,
   so far as the objections are drawn from the advanced Christology of the
   Gospel, and the alleged traces of Alexandrian influence, after what we
   have seen of the general state of opinion in the apostolic age, very
   little weight need be attached to them. The Christology of John is not
   a whit higher than the Christology of Paul, or that of the Epistle to
   the Hebrews, or even that of the Apocalypse--all lying within the
   apostolic age; the alleged traces of Philonic influence are as
   conspicuous in the Epistle to the Hebrews as in the Fourth Gospel. It
   is not, therefore, necessary to go beyond the apostolic age to account
   for them. I question, indeed, very much whether, if we except the
   prologue--i.e., if we keep to Christ's own doings and sayings--there is
   much in John's Gospel at all which would directly suggest the
   peculiarities of Philo. There is certainly a very exalted doctrine of
   Christ's Person, but the doctrine is Christian, not Philonic. [510]

   It may, however, still be said that at least the Synoptics [511] tell a
   very different story. Here, it will be maintained, we have the human,
   the truly historical Christ, in contrast with the idealised and
   untrustworthy picture of the fourth evangelist. Dr. Martineau makes
   this his strongest ground for the rejection of the Gospel of John. But
   is it really so? Certainly it is not so, if we let these Gospels--as it
   is only fair that in the first instance we should do--speak fully and
   freely for themselves, and do not, in the interest of theory, curtail
   any part of their testimony. The picture given us in the Synoptics is
   not at all that of the humanitarian Christ. We have a true human life,
   indeed,--the life of One who went in and out among men as a friend and
   brother, who grieved, who suffered, who was tempted, who was poor and
   despised,--a true "Son of Man," in every sense of the word. But do we
   not find more? Does this represent their whole testimony about Christ?
   On the contrary, does not this lowly Being move as a supernatural
   Personage throughout, and do not His character and works bear amplest
   witness to the justice of His claims? Is there, according to the
   Synoptics, nothing extraordinary in the commencement of Christ's life,
   nothing extraordinary in its close, nothing in keeping with this
   extraordinary beginning and end in the career that lies between? It is
   easy, no doubt, to get rid of all this by denying the historical
   character of the Gospels, or pruning them down to suit; but after every
   allowance is made for possible additions to the narrative, there
   remains a clear enough picture of Jesus to enable us to determine the
   great subjects of His teaching, and the general character of His
   claims. In fact, the further criticism goes, the supernatural character
   of Jesus stands out in clearer relief. These are not mere
   embellishments, mere external additions, obscuring the picture of a
   Christ otherwise human. They are not things that can be stripped off,
   and the real image of Christ be left behind, as the writing of a
   palimpsest might be removed and the picture below be brought into view.
   The history is the picture. All fair historical criticism must see that
   these supernatural features belong to the very essence of the
   historical representation of Jesus in the Gospels, and that, if we take
   them away, we have no longer a historical Christ at all, but only a
   Christ of our own imaginings; [512] that we must either take these
   features as part of our view of Christ, or say frankly with Strauss
   that we really know little or nothing about Him. But it is just the
   impossibility of resting in this dictum with any fair regard to the
   canons of historical criticism which has constantly forced even
   negative critics back to a fuller recognition of the historical reality
   of the portraiture in the Gospels, and has again placed them in the
   dilemma of having to reconsider these claims of the Son of Man.

   Let us look at these claims of Jesus in the Synoptics a little more in
   detail. Even this title "Son of Man"--found only in Christ's own lips,
   and never given Him by His followers--has something unique and
   exceptional about it. It wells up from the depths of the consciousness
   of One who knew Himself to stand in some peculiar and representative
   relation to humanity, and to bear the nature of man in some exceptional
   way. [513] He is not simply "a Son of Man," but "the Son of Man"; just
   as, in a higher relation, He is not simply "a Son of God," but "the Son
   of God." How high this latter relation is, is brought out in the
   words--"No one knoweth the Son save the Father; neither doth any know
   the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to
   reveal Him." [514] In conformity with the uniqueness of nature implied
   in these titles, He claims to be the Messiah, [515] the Fulfiller of
   law and prophets, [516] the Founder of the kingdom of God, the supreme
   Legislator and Head of that kingdom, [517] He, through faith in whom
   salvation is to be obtained, [518] the One who demands, as no other is
   entitled to do, the absolute and undivided surrender of the heart to
   Himself. [519] He forgives sins with Divine authority, [520] is the
   giver of the Holy Ghost, [521] ascribes an expiatory virtue to His
   death, [522] anticipates His resurrection and return in glory, [523]
   announces Himself as the appointed Judge of the world. [524] This claim
   of Christ to be the final Judge of the world, found already in the
   Sermon on the Mount; [525] His repeated declarations of His future
   return in the glory of His Father, and His own glory, and the glory of
   the holy angels; [526] the eschatological parables, in which He makes
   the ultimate destinies of men depend on relation to Himself, [527] are
   among the most remarkable features in His teaching, and are not to be
   explained away as mere figurative assurances of the ultimate triumph of
   His cause. They constitute a claim which must either be conceded, or
   Christ be pronounced the victim of an extravagant hallucination! We
   have to add to these claims of Christ, His endorsement of Peter's
   confession of the unique dignity of His Person--"Thou art the Christ,
   the Son of the living God"; [528] His solemn words, so fraught with
   selfconsciousness, in answer to the High Priest's
   adjuration--"Henceforth ye shall see the Son of Man sitting at the
   right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven"; [529] and
   such sublime declarations, implying an omnipresent and omniscient
   relation to His Church, as "Where two or three are gathered together in
   My name, there am I in the midst of them." [530]

   These are stupendous claims of Christ, but we have next to observe that
   the whole representation of Christ in the Synoptic Gospels is worthy of
   them. I do not dwell here on the holy majesty with which Christ bears
   Himself throughout the Gospels in all circumstances, on the tone of
   authority with which He speaks, on the grace and tenderness which
   marked His whole relations to men,--I would concentrate attention on
   the one point that Christ, according to the picture given of Him in the
   Gospels, is a sinless Being--in this respect also standing quite apart
   from other men. It is the uniform testimony of the apostles and other
   writers of the New Testament--of Paul, of Peter, of John, of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews, of the Apocalypse, [531] --that Christ was
   without sin; and the Synoptic narratives, in the picture they give us
   of a character entirely God-centred, dominated by the passion of hove
   to men, embracing the widest contrasts, maintaining itself in absolute
   spiritual freedom in relation to the world, to men and to events,
   uniformly victorious in temptation, untouched by the faintest stain of
   base, paltry, or selfish motive, completely bear out this description.
   So strong is the evidence on this point, that we find the sinlessness
   of Christ widely admitted, even by the representatives of schools whose
   general principles, one would imagine, would lead them to deny it--by
   adherents of the Hegelian school like Daub, Marheineke, Rosenkranz,
   Vatke; [532] by mediating theologians of all types, like
   Schleiermacher, [533] Beyschlag, [534] Rothe, [535] and Ritschl; [536]
   by liberal theologians, like Hase [537] and Schenkel, [538] and so
   decided an opponent of the miraculous even as Lipsius. [539] We must
   contend, however, that if Christ was really the sinless Being which the
   Gospels represent Him, and His followers believed Him to be, we have a
   phenomenon in history which is not to be explained out of mere natural
   grounds, or on any principle of development, but a literal new
   creation, a true moral miracle, involving further consequences as to
   the origin and nature of the exceptional Personality to whom these
   predicates of sinlessness belong. [540]

   In keeping with the character and with the claims of Jesus are the
   works ascribed to Him in the Gospels. It is, as the merest glance will
   show, a supernatural history throughout. The miracles attributed to
   Jesus are not mere wonders, but deeds of mercy and love--the outflow of
   just such Divinity as we claim for Him. They are, accordingly, wrought
   by Jesus in His own name, in the exercise of His own authority, [541]
   and are suitably spoken of as simply His "works" [542] --i.e. standing
   in the same relation of naturalness to Him, and to His position in the
   world, as our ordinary works do to us, and to our position in the
   world. So far from being isolated from the rest of His manifestation,
   Christ's miracles are entirely of one piece with it,--are revelations
   of the powers and spirit of His kingdom, [543] --are the works of the
   kingdom, or, as they are called in John, "signs." [544] The most
   skilful criticism, therefore, has never been able to excise them from
   the narrative. Their roots intertwine inseparably with the most
   characteristic elements of the gospel tradition,--with sayings of
   Christ, for example, of unimpeachable freshness, originality, and
   beauty; and, as part of the history, they produce upon us precisely the
   same impression of dignity, wisdom, and beneficence, as the rest of the
   narrative. They are, in short, integral parts of that total
   presentation of Jesus which produces on us so marked and irresistible
   an impression of Divinity. [545]

   Even this is not the highest point in the Synoptic testimony about
   Christ. If Christ died, He rose again on the third day. Meeting with
   His disciples, He declares to them, "All authority hath been given unto
   Me in heaven and on earth"; He commissions them to preach repentance
   and remission of sins in His name to all the nations; He bids them
   "make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the
   Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost" (one name); He utters for
   their encouragement this sublime promise, "Lo, I am with you always,
   even unto the end of the world." [546] There can be no mistake as to
   the meaning of this Trinitarian formula, which, as Dorner says, does
   not express a relation to men, but "requires us to regard the Father as
   the Father of the Son, and the Son as the Son of the Father, and
   therefore does not signify a paternal relation to the world in general,
   but to the Son, who, standing between the Father and the Spirit, must
   be somehow thought of as pertaining to the sphere of the Divine, and
   therefore denotes a distinction in the Divine itself." [547] Attempts
   are made to challenge the authenticity of these sayings. But they are
   at least part of the Synoptic representation of Christ, and must be
   taken into account when the comparison is between the Synoptic
   representation and that found in John, and in other parts of the New
   Testament. When, however, Christ's whole claim is considered, no valid
   objection can be taken to these sayings, except on principles which
   imply that the resurrection never took place at all,--a position which
   works round to the subversion of the claim itself. [548]

   Such, then, is the view of Christ in the Synoptic Gospels; and the
   conclusion I draw is, that it is in keeping with the estimate formed of
   Christ's Person in the apostolic age. The two things are in harmony.
   Given such a life as we have in the Gospels, this explains the
   phenomena of the apostolic age. On the other hand, given the estimate
   of Christ's Person and work in the apostolic age, this supports the
   reliableness of the picture of Christ in the Gospels, for only from
   such a life could the faith of the Church have originated. We have, in
   this Synoptic picture, the very Being whom the writings of Paul and
   John present to us; and the forms they use are the only forms which can
   adequately interpret Him to us. In other words, given the Christ of the
   Synoptic Gospels, the doctrine of Paul and John is felt to be the only
   adequate explanation of His character and claims. I agree, therefore,
   entirely with Dorner when he says, "It may be boldly affirmed that the
   entire representation of Christ given by the Synoptics may be placed by
   the side of the Johannine as perfectly identical, inasmuch as faith,
   moulded by means of the Synoptic tradition, must have essentially the
   same features in its concept of Christ as John has"; and adds, "Those
   who reject the Gospel of John on account of its glorifying of Christ,
   can hardly have set themselves in clear relations with the Synoptic
   Christology." [549]

   I claim, then, to have shown that if we are to do justice to the facts
   of Christianity, we must accept the supernatural view of Christ's
   Person, and recognise in Him the appearance of a Divine Being in
   humanity. The argument I have conducted--if it be correct--goes further
   than to show that this doctrine is an integral part of Christianity. If
   this were all, it might still be said, Rather than that this doctrine
   be accepted, let Christianity go! But if my contention is right, we are
   not at liberty to let Christianity go. The reason why Christianity
   cannot be waved out of the world at the bidding of sceptics simply is,
   that the facts are too strong for the attempt. The theories which would
   explain Christianity away make shipwreck on the facts. But if
   Christianity is not to be parted with, its full testimony to itself
   must be maintained; and we have now seen what this means. Formerly it
   was shown that the attempts to maintain Christianity, while rejecting
   the truth of the Incarnation, have uniformly failed. Now we have seen
   why it is so. It was shown also whither the rejection of Christianity
   led us, and how the painful steps of return conducted us back through
   Theism to Revelation, and through Revelation to belief in Christ as the
   supreme Revealer. But this faith heads us again to His testimony about
   Himself, and so once more to the Incarnation. Thus it is that the Lord
   stands constantly challenging the ages to give their answer to His
   question, "What think ye of Christ? whose Son is He?" [550] and
   increasingly it is shown that it is not in the world's power to put
   this question aside. However silenced for the moment, it soon again
   asserts its rights, and will not cease to be heard till humanity, from
   one end of the earth to the other, has joined in the devout
   acknowledgment--"My Lord and my God!" [551]

    III. Doctrinal aspects of the Incarnation: proposed reconstructions.

   III. This fact of the Incarnation being given, how are we to interpret
   it? The full discussion of what, doctrinally, is involved in the
   Incarnation, belongs rather to dogmatics than to the present inquiry;
   but certain limiting positions may at least be laid down, which may
   help to keep our thoughts in harmony with the facts we have had before
   us, and may serve as a check on modern theories, which, professing to
   give us a re-reading of this all-important doctrine more in agreement
   with the Christian verity than the old Christological decisions, fall
   short of, or go beyond these facts. The early decisions of the Church
   on Christ's Person are not, indeed, to be regarded as beyond criticism.
   It may very well be that reconstruction is needed in this doctrine as
   in many others. Only, we should be careful not to part with the old
   formulas till something better--something at least equally true to the
   facts of Christianity--is put in their place; and I confess that most
   of the modern attempts at a revised Christology do not seem to me to
   fulfil this condition.

   Constrained by the evidence of Scripture, many theologians agree in
   ascribing "Godhead" to Christ, whose views of the Person of Christ yet
   fall short of what the complete testimony of Scripture seems to
   require. Schleiermacher may be included in this class, though he avoids
   the term; [552] of more recent theologians, Rothe, Beyschlag, Ritschl,
   Lipsius, etc., who speak freely of the "Godhead" (Gottheit),
   "God-manhood" (Gottmenschheit), of Christ, and of the "Incarnation"
   (Menschwerdung) of God in Him. [553] But what do these expressions
   mean? In all, or most, of these theories, Christ has a high and unique
   position assigned to Him. He is the second Adam, or new Head of the
   race, Son of God in a sense that no other is, archetypal Man, sinless
   Mediator and Redeemer of mankind. [554] This is a great deal, and must
   be recognised in any theory of the Incarnation. All these theories
   acknowledge, further, a peculiar being or Revelation of God in Christ,
   on the ground of which these predicates "Godhead" and "God-manhood" are
   ascribed to Him. But what is its nature? In Schleiermacher, as already
   seen in the second Lecture, it is the constant and energetic activity
   of that God-consciousness which is potentially present in every
   man--which constitutes, therefore, an original element in human nature.
   [555] In Rothe, it is an ethical union of God with humanity, gradually
   brought about in the course of the sinless development of Christ, and
   constituting, when complete, a perfect indwelling of God in man--a
   perfect unity of the Divine and human. [556] In Beyschlag, it is the
   consciousness of a perfect and original relation of Sonship to God,
   which has its transcendental ground in an impersonal (Divine-human)
   principle eternally pre-existent in the Godhead. [557] In Ritschl, the
   "Godhead" of Christ has a purely moral and religious sense, expressing
   the fact that in Christ, as the supreme Revealer of God, and Founder of
   the kingdom of God, there is perfect oneness of will with God in this
   world-purpose, and a perfect manifestation of the Divine attributes of
   grace and truth, and of dominion over the world. [558] In Lipsius,
   again, and those who think with him, "Incarnation" and "Godhead" denote
   the realisation in Christ of that perfect relation of Sonship to God
   (Gottessohnschaft) which lies in the original idea of humanity, and the
   perfect Revelation of the Divine will of love (Liebewillen) in that
   Revelation. [559] Now I do not deny that in these theories we have a
   certain union of the Divine and human, just as believers in Christ,
   through union with Him and participation in His Spirit, become "sons of
   God," and "partakers of the Divine nature." [560] I do not deny,
   further, that these theories secure for Christ a certain distinction
   from every other, in that they make Him the original type of that
   relation of Divine Sonship into which others can only enter through
   Him. It is a thought also which not unnaturally occurs, whether on this
   idea of a God-filled humanity--a humanity of which it may be truly said
   that in an ethical respect the fulness of the Godhead dwells in it
   bodily--we have not all that is of practical value in any doctrine of
   Incarnation. We must beware, however, of imposing on ourselves with
   words, and I believe that, if we do not rise to a higher view, it will
   be difficult, as the second Lecture showed, to prevent ourselves
   drifting to pure humanitarianism.

   Two things are to be considered here--First, whether these theories are
   tenable on their own merits; and, second, whether they do justice to
   the facts of Christ's Revelation, and to the data of the New Testament
   generally. I shall offer a few remarks on these points, then add a
   brief notice of the theories known as Kenotic.

   1. There are two classes of these theories--those which do not, and
   those which do, presuppose a transcendental or metaphysical ground for
   the predicate "Godhead" applied to Christ, and as important differences
   exist between them, it is desirable to distinguish them.

   (1) Of the former class are those of Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Lipsius,
   with many others that might be named. I abstract from other features in
   these theories, and look only at the grounds on which "Godhead" is
   ascribed to Christ; and I do not find any which transcend the limits of
   humanity. Christ is archetypal man, ideal man, sinless man, the perfect
   Revelation of grace and truth, the central individual of the race, the
   bearer of the principle of true religion, the Founder of the kingdom of
   God in humanity, the pre-eminent object of the Father's hove,--but He
   is not more than man. His humanity may he a "God-filled" humanity;
   still a God-filled man is one thing, and God become man is another.
   There may be participation in the Divine life--even in the Divine
   nature--on the part of the ordinary believer; but the man in whom God
   thus dwells does not on this account regard himself as Divine, does not
   speak of himself as a Divine person, does not think himself entitled to
   Divine honours, would deem it blasphemy to have the term "Godhead"
   applied to him. If, therefore, this is the only account we can give of
   Christ's Person, it is clear that this predicate "Godhead" can never
   properly be applied to Him. We might speak of the Divine in Christ, but
   we could not say that Christ Himself was Divine. We might see in Him
   the highest organ of Divine Revelation, but we would require to
   distinguish between the God revealing Himself and the humanity through
   which He is manifested. It would be blasphemy here also to speak of
   Christ Himself as God. It would be idolatry to give Him Divine honours.
   We find, therefore, that Ritschl has to admit that it is only in a
   figurative and improper sense that the Church can attribute "Godhead"
   to Christ. [561] This predicate, he says, is not a theoretic truth, but
   only a judgment of value--an expression of the worth which Christ has
   for the religious consciousness of the believer. In further carrying
   out the same idea, both Schleiermacher and Ritschl strip away, as
   formerly shown, all the eschatological attributes from Christ, and
   resolve His sitting at the right hand of God, His return to judge the
   world, etc., into metaphors. The only real sense in which Christ is
   spiritually present in His Church is through the perpetuation of His
   image, of His teaching, and of His influence in the community of
   believers. [562] This is the legitimate consequence of a theory which
   does not go beyond the bounds of the human in its estimate of Christ;
   for if the eschatological teaching of Jesus is admitted, it seems
   impossible to stop short of a much higher view of His Person. This
   method, however, of simply sweeping aside what is distasteful, is too
   violent to be long endured; there are besides those utterances of Jesus
   which bespeak the consciousness of a relation different in kind, and
   not merely in degree, from that sustained by others to the Father. This
   class of theories, therefore, naturally passes over to another--that
   which seeks to do justice to the facts by admitting a deeper ground for
   Christ's Personality than the earthly one.

   (2)Of this second class of theories, I may take those of Rothe and
   Beyschlag as examples. Rothe thinks he effectually secures the idea of
   Christ's Godhead by assuming that, in the course of Christ's sinless
   development, God constantly unites Himself with Him in closer and
   closer relations, till at length a perfect union both of person and of
   nature is effected. [563] Beyschlag thinks to do the same by supposing
   that a Divine impersonal principle--a pre-existent ideal humanity--is
   somehow incarnated in Christ. [564] But not to speak of the absence of
   scriptural proof for both of these theories, see the difficulties under
   which they labour. Can it be seriously said that, if a transcendental
   ground of Christ's Person is to be admitted, these theories have any
   advantage in simplicity or intelligibility over the old view? Take
   Rothe's theory. What are we to make of the supposition of a personality
   which begins as human, and ultimately and gradually is changed into
   Divine? Then what is meant by two persons merging into one, and this by
   moral process? For God is one Person to begin with, and Christ is
   another, and at length a perfect union is effected of both. Do we
   really in this theory get beyond the idea of an ethical union, or
   perfect moral friendship, in which, after all, the two Persons remain
   distinct, though united in will and love? If this is the character of
   the union, it is only by a misuse of terms that we can speak of Christ
   becoming really God. Yet Rothe is perfectly in earnest with this
   conception of the deification of Christ, so we ask finally--How is this
   newly constituted Person related to God the Father? For Rothe
   acknowledges no immanent distinction of Persons in the God-head, and it
   is the Father Himself who thus unites Himself with Christ, and confers
   Godhead upon His Person. Rothe says expressly, "The Incarnation of God
   in the Second Adam is essentially an incarnation of both in Him--of the
   Divine personality, and of the Divine nature." [565] But if it is the
   One absolute Personality whom we call God, who enters into the union
   with the humanity of Jesus, how can the resultant relation be described
   as that of Father and Son? Or if a new Divine Person really is
   constituted, does not Rothe's theory amount to this, that, since the
   Incarnation, a new Person has been added to the Godhead? But what does
   the constitution of a new Divine Person mean? Is it not, if the
   expression is to be taken literally, very like a contradiction in
   terms? I need not wait long on Beyschlag's rival theory of a
   pre-existent impersonal humanity, which solves no difficulties, and is
   loaded with inconceivabilities of its own. For in what sense can this
   idea of humanity be spoken of as Divine, any more than any other idea
   of the Divine mind which is realised in time h--the idea, e.g., of the
   world, or of the believer, or of the Church. What, besides, is meant by
   a heavenly, ideal humanity? Does it include only the single Person of
   Christ, or not also all the members of the human race? [566] How,
   further, is this ideal of humanity, which forms the supernatural
   principle in Christ, related to His actual humanity of flesh and blood,
   which came to Him "of the seed of David"? [567] Finally, if Christ's
   Person was thus peculiarly constituted, even in respect of its
   humanity, how can it be said of Him that He was made in all things like
   unto His brethren? [568] It may seem a waste of time to discuss such
   questions; yet theories like Rothe's and Beyschlag's have their uses;
   for they aid us, by a process of exclusion, in seeing what the true
   theory must be, and where we are to look for it.

   2. The second question I proposed to ask is already in large measure
   answered in the course of the above discussion, Do these theories do
   justice to the facts of Christ's Revelation, and to the data of the New
   Testament generally? They clearly do not, either in a negative or a
   positive respect. There is no hint in the Scriptures of either Rothe's
   gradual incarnation, or of Beyschlag's pre-existent principle of
   humanity; but there are: many passages which directly, or by
   implication, claim for Christ personal pre-existence, and attribute to
   Him Divine acts and functions in that state of pre-existence. But,
   apart from this, all those passages which claim for Christ a unique
   relation of Sonship to the Father, taken with the sayings which imply
   His consciousness of the possession of attributes and functions raised
   above those of humanity, point to a super-earthly and pre-incarnate
   state of existence. And this brings us back to the fundamental
   distinction between a true and a false or inadequate doctrine of
   Incarnation. Incarnation is not simply the endowing of human nature
   with the highest conceivable plenitude of gifts and graces; it is not a
   mere dynamical relation of God to the human spirit--acting on it or in
   it with exceptional energy; it is not simply the coming to
   consciousness of the metaphysical unity all along subsisting between
   humanity and God; it is not even such moral union, such spiritual
   indwelling and oneness of character and will, as subsists between God
   and the believer; still less, of course, is it analogous to the heathen
   ideas of sons of the gods, where the relation is that of physical
   paternity --or of the appearances of gods in human guise--or even of
   temporary appearances in humanity, as in the case of the Avatars of
   Vishnu. The scriptural idea of the Incarnation is as unique as is the
   Biblical conception as a whole. It is not, to state the matter in a
   word, the union simply of the Divine nature with the human,--for that I
   acknowledge in the case of every believer through the indwelling
   Spirit,--but the entrance of a Divine Person into the human. That there
   is an analogy, and a closer one than is sometimes admitted, between the
   believer's relation to God and Christ's relation to the Father is
   expressly declared in Christ's own words in John xvii.21, where He asks
   "that they may all be one; even as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in
   Thee, that they may be one in Us." But the subject here is moral
   union,--not union of essence, as in John i.1, and perhaps John x.30,
   hut the mutual ensphering of personalities in an atmosphere of love,
   such as obtains in its highest degree between the Father and the Son.
   For "he that abideth in Love, abideth in God, and God abideth in him."
   [569] There is this also in Christ. But the distinction remains--these
   personalities of ours are human, and continue so, no matter how
   entirely filled, penetrated, possessed, with the light and love and
   knowledge of God they may be; but His was a Personality of a higher
   rank--a Divine Personality, which entered into the limitations and
   conditions of humanity from above, which was not originally human, as
   ours is, but became so. Here questions deep and difficult, I.
   acknowledge, crowd thick.upon us, to many of which no answer may be
   possible; but so much as this, I think, is assuredly implied in the
   Christian Incarnation.

   3. Before, however, venturing further in this direction, I must bestow
   at least a glance on what is known as the question of the Kenosis. This
   word, meaning "emptying," is taken, as is well known, from Phil. ii.7,
   in which passage Christ is said to have "emptied Himself" (heauton ek
   enose), taking the form of a servant. The question is, What does this
   emptying include? Did the Son of God--the Eternal Word--literally lay
   aside His Divine glory, and, ceasing to he in the form of God, enter by
   human birth into the conditions of earthly poverty and weakness? Or, if
   He did not, what is the import of this remarkable phrase? The Kenotic
   theories--represented en Germany by a long list of honoured names [570]
   --answer the former question in the affirmative. Godet among French
   writers advocates the same view. The Divine Logos, he thinks, literally
   laid aside His Divine attributes at the Incarnation, and entered the
   sphere of the finite as an unconscious babe. [571] The object of these
   theories, of course, is to secure the reality of Christ's humanity, and
   the fact of a true human development, which seemed imperilled by the
   older view. Notwithstanding, however, the wide support they have
   received, I cannot think that these theories will ever permanently
   commend themselves to the judgment of the Church. [572] They seem to
   me--to come to the heart of the matter at once--to involve an
   impossibility, inasmuch as they ask us to believe in the temporary
   suspension of the consciousness, and the cessation from all Divine
   functions, of one of the Persons of the God-head! How does this consist
   with Scripture? Are we not told of the Son, in particular, not only
   that by Him all things were created, but that in Him all things
   consist--that He upholdeth all things by the word of His power? Is this
   relation to the universe not an essential one? and does the Kenotic
   theory not reduce it to one wholly unessential and contingent? I cannot
   therefore accept this theory, nor do I think that the reality of the
   Incarnation requires it. I might appeal here to the analogy of nature.
   There is an immanent presence of God in nature, but there is also a
   transcendent existence of God beyond nature. So the Divine Son took
   upon Him our nature with its human limits, but above and beyond that,
   if we may so express it, was the vast "over-soul" of His Divine
   consciousness. Even human psychology, in making us more familiar than
   we were with the idea of different strata of consciousness even in the
   same personal being, gives us a hint which need not be lost. The sense
   of the apostle's words seems sufficiently met by the lowly form of
   Christ's earthly manifestation--"despised and rejected of men, a man of
   sorrows, and acquainted with grief." [573]

   The result of our inquiry has not been to overthrow the Christological
   decisions of the early Church, but rather to impress us with the
   justice and tact of these decisions in guarding the truth against
   opposite errors. Has all the labour and earnestness of modern
   investigation on this profound subject, then, been absolutely without
   result? I do not think so. One remarkable gain has already been
   adverted to, in the tendency of modern speculation to draw the Divine
   and the human nearer together, and to emphasise, if not their identity,
   at least their kindredness, and the capacity of the human to receive
   the Divine. [574] But many lights and suggestions have been afforded in
   the treatment of this subject, from Schleiermacher downwards, which in
   any attempt at a constructive view must always be of great value. This
   will perhaps become apparent if, in closing this survey, I notice an
   objection which is sometimes urged against the view of the Incarnation
   here presented--the ordinary, and as I believe the scriptural
   one--namely, that in affirming the incarnation of a heavenly and
   pre-existent Person we seem to impinge on the reality, or at least the
   integrity, of the human nature which Christ bore. The question is, Had
   Christ's human nature an independent Personality of its own, or was the
   Divine the only Personality? To guard against Nestorian error, or the
   assumption of two persons in Christ, the Church, it will be remembered,
   affirmed what is called the "impersonality" of the human nature of
   Christ, and, as might appear, with perfect reason on the principles of
   the Logos Christology. [575] But this very consequence is made in
   modern times the ground of an objection to that Christology, which, it
   is said, while maintaining the Divinity, impairs the integrity of the
   humanity, of the Redeemer. For (1) If Christ's human nature had no
   independent Personality, was not His human nature thereby mutilated?
   and (2) If it is the Divine Personality that is the subject--the
   Ego--does not this detract on the other side from the truth of His
   humanity? For this reason, some are disposed to grant that Christ's
   humanity also must be conceived of as personal, and that the
   Incarnation must be thought of, with Rothe, as the union both of person
   and of nature. Let us see how it stands with this difficulty on closer
   inspection, and from what point of view it can best be obviated.

   1. It would be well if the objector to the ordinary ecclesiastical
   view--he who admits in any sense an Incarnation--would think out
   carefully what is implied in the attribution of an independent
   Personality to Christ's human nature. On both sides there will be
   agreement that the unity of the Person must in some form be maintained.
   You cannot have two Egos in Christ's one Divine-human Person--however
   close the relation between them. If the human Ego retains in any
   measure its distinction from the Divine, then we have not an
   Incarnation, but a Nestorian relation of persons. If, therefore, an
   independent human Ego is to be assumed, it must be supposed to be so
   incorporated with the Divine Ego--so host in it, so interpenetrated by
   it, so absorbed in it--that all sense of separate identity is parted
   with; [576] while, on the other hand, the Divine Ego so transfuses
   itself into the human, so limits and conditions itself, so becomes the
   ruling and controlling force in the human consciousness, as itself
   practically to become human. There is perhaps no obvious objection to
   this view, but, at the same time, it is difficult to see what is gained
   by it. The human Ego, as a distinct Ego, is as entirely lost sight
   of--is as completely taken up and merged into the Divine--as on the
   other supposition. For it is of the essence of the true view of
   Incarnation that the bond of personal identity should remain unbroken
   between the Son who shared the glory of the Father in eternity, and the
   human Christ who prayed, "O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self
   with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was." [577]

   2. The other side of the objection -- If it is the Divine Personality
   which is the subject, does not this detract from the truth of the human
   nature, give us only an unreal and doketic Christ?--raises a much
   deeper question--that, namely, of the original relation of the Divine
   Logos to humanity. If God can become man, it can only be on the
   presupposition of an original relation between God and humanity, in
   virtue of which there is an essential kindredness and bond of
   connection between them. This is already implied in the Scripture
   doctrine of man made in the image of God, but it receives a deeper
   interpretation through the doctrine of the Logos. [578] When it is
   objected that the Divine Logos, even though entering into the nature
   and conditions and limitations of humanity, is not truly a human
   Person, the question is to be asked, Is the relation between
   Personality in the Logos and that in man one of contrariety, or is not
   Personality in the Logos rather the truth of that which we find in
   humanity? Is man's personality in every case not grounded in that of
   the Logos? Is He not the light and life of all men, even in a natural
   respect--the light of intelligence, of conscience, of spirit? But if
   man's personality is thus grounded in the Logos, is there a difference
   of kind between them, or not rather one of condition? Is there not a
   human side in the Logos, and a Divine side in man? and is not this the
   truth we have to conserve in such theories as Beyschlag's and Hegel's.
   There is no denial, therefore, in the doctrine of the Incarnation,
   rightly understood, of a true human Personality in Christ,--what is
   denied is that the Personality of the Divine Son cannot also become in
   the incarnate condition a truly human one. A further question would be,
   whether the idea of the human race did not include from the first the
   idea of an Incarnation, with the Son Himself as Head--a subject which
   will be dealt with in the next Lecture.

   I remark, in a word, in closing, that we do not do justice to this
   stupendous fact of the Incarnation, if we neglect to look at it in the
   light of its revealed ends. The advantage of taking the doctrine in
   this way is, that we see at a glance the inadequacy of all lower
   theories of the Person of Christ, if the ends intended to be
   accomplished by His appearance were to be attained. If Christ came to
   do only the work of a prophet, or of a philanthropist, or of a teacher
   of ethical truth, I admit that the Incarnation would shrivel up into an
   absurdity. The means would be out of all proportion to the ends. But
   who will say this of the actual ends for which the Son of God came into
   the world? Who will affirm that if a world was to be redeemed from sin
   and guilt, and spiritual bondage--to be renewed, sanctified, and
   brought into the fellowship of life with God--anyone less than Divine
   was adequate to the task? [579] Here, again, the Christian view is in
   keeping with itself. There is a proportion between the Incarnation and
   the ends sought to be accomplished by it. The denial of the Incarnation
   of necessity carries with it a lowering of the view of the work Christ
   came to do for men. He, on the other hand, who believes in that
   work--who feels the need of it--much more who has experienced the
   redeeming power of it in his own heart--will not doubt that He who has
   brought this salvation to him is none other than the "Strong Son of
   God--Immortal Love." [580]

   nature of His Person."

   [509] It is precisely the discourses of Jesus in the Fourth Gospel
   which Wendt, in his recent Die Lehre Jesu, is disposed to attribute to
   a genuine Johannine source. On the difference of style between the
   Johannine and the Synoptical discourses, Godet remarks: "The discourses
   of the Fourth Gospel, then, do not resemble a photograph, but the
   extracted essence of a savoury fruit. From the change wrought in the
   external form of the substance, it doss not follow that the slightest
   foreign element has been mingled with the latter."--Introduction to
   Commentary, p. 135 (Eng. trans.). The contrast, however, may be
   exaggerated, as shown by comparison of passages where the Synoptics and
   John cross each other.--Cf. Godet, Introduction, pp. 155-157.

   [510] Harnack expresses himself very decidedly on this subject.
   "Neither the religious philosophy of Philo," he says, "nor the manner
   of thought out of which it originated, has exercised a provable
   influence on the first generation of Christian believers. . . . A
   Philonic element is also not provable in Paul. . . . The apprehension
   of the relation of God and the world in the Fourth Gospel is not the

   [538] In his Dogmatik, see sketch in Pfleiderer's Dev. of Theol. pp.

   118. In his Religionsphilosophie, i. p. 339 (Eng. trans.), he blames
   Schleiermacher for identifying "this personality so entirely with the
   ideal principle, that it is exalted to an absolute ideal, and indeed to
   a miraculous appearance." This affords a good standard for the

   to the perfection of Jesus. "In the attainment of this serene inward
   disposition, in unity with God, and comprehending all men as brethren,
   Jesus had realised in Himself the prophetic ideal of the New Covenant
   with the Law written in the heart; He had--to speak with the

   it, the expression is justified that in the Redeemer God became man, in
   a sense true of Him exclusively; as also each moment of His existence,
   so far as one can isolate it represents a new and similar incarnation
   of God and state of being incarnate; since always and everywhere, all
   that is human in Him proceeds out of that which is Divine."--Pp. 56,

   realised in ail men,--is, in fact, simply the ideal Man; hut he seeks
   to establish a metaphysical distinction between Christ's humanity and
   ours, in virtue of which His personality is "originally and
   essentially" Divine, while ours is not.--Christologie, p. 58. See

   [574] In a practical respect the chief gain is that we begin with the

   [576] This was Origen's view in the early Church. The Logos, he
   thought, united itself with an unfallen soul in the pro-existent state.
   Cf. De Principiis, Book ii. chap. vi.: "But since, agreeably to the
   faculty of free-will, variety and diversity characterised the
   individual souls, so that one was attached with a warmer love to the
   Author of its being, and another with a feebler and weaker regard, that
   soul, . . . inhering from the beginning of the creation, and
   afterwards, inseparably and indissolubly in Him, as being the Wisdom
   and Word of God, and the Truth and the true Light, and receiving Him
   wholly, and passing into His light and splendour, was made with Him an
   a pre-eminent degree one Spirit, according to the promise of the
   apostle to those who ought to imitate it, that be who is joined to the
   Lord is one spirit' (1 Cor. vi. 17). . . . Neither was it opposed to
   the nature of that soul, as a rational existence, to receive God, into
   whom, as stated above, as into the Word and the Wisdom and the Truth,
   it had already wholly entered. And therefore deservedly is it also
   called, along with the flesh which it had assumed, the Son of God, and
   the Power of God, the Christ, and the Wisdom of God, either because it
   was wholly in the Son of God, or because it received the Son of God
   wholly into itself."--Ante-Nicene Library trans. Origen's view may be
   compared with Rothe's, only that Rothe does not allow a separate
   personality in the Logos.

   [577] John xvii. 5.

   [578] An original relation of the Logos to humanity on the ground of
   the Incarnation, is already implied in the theology of Irenaeus,
   Clement, and Origen (cf. Dorner's History); is made prominent in recent
   Christological discussions in Germany; was the view of Maurice, etc.

   [579] Even Hartmann recognises this. "If one sees in Jesus," he says,
   "only the eon of the carpenter Joseph and of his wife Mary, this Jesus
   and His death can as little redeem me from my sins as, say, Bismarck
   can do it," etc.--Selbstzersetzung, p. 92.

APPENDIX TO LECTURE VI

  THE SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS OF JESUS.

   It is a significant circumstance that, in recent years, interest has
   concentrated itself more and more on the question of Christ's
   self-consciousness--that is, on what He thought and felt about Himself,
   and on how He arrived at these convictions. The fact is an illustration
   of the saying of Godet, quoted in the Lecture, that in the last
   instance Christianity rests on Christ's witness to Himself. I have
   noted below some of the chief books which bear upon this subject, [581]
   and may refer here to a few of their results, only venturing very
   sparingly upon criticism.

   The general subject is the origin and development of Christ's Messianic
   consciousness, as that may be deduced from the Gospels, and the points
   chiefly discussed are the following:--

   1. What was the fundamental fact in Christ's Messianic consciousness
   out of which the other elements grew--the consciousness of a perfect
   religious relation to the Father (Beyschlag, Weiss, Wendt, etc.), or,
   behind this, of sinlessness? (Baldensperger).

   2. When did Christ clearly realise His Messianic calling? --At the
   Baptism? (Beyschlag, Wendt, Baldensperger, etc.). Or earlier? (Neander,
   Hase, Weiss, etc.). Or not till a later period? (Renan, Strauss,
   Schenkel, etc.).

   3. Was Christ's "plan" one and the same throughout? (Neander, Schmidt,
   etc.). Or, did Christ's views change with the course of events?
   (Beyschlag, Schenkel, Hase, Keim, Baldensperger, etc.). Was it, e.g.,
   only gradually that He realised the necessity of His death? (Beyschlag,
   Weiss, Baldensperger, Wendt, etc.).

   4. The import and origin of the titles "Son of Man" and "Son of God."
   Does the former represent Christ as "weak, creaturely man"? (Holsten,
   Wendt). Or as "ideal, typical man"? (Neander, Reuss, Beyschlag, etc.).
   Or simply as Messiah? (Baldensperger). Was it borrowed from Daniel (as
   most hold), and to what extent was it a popular, well-known title for
   Messiah? (Against this, Matt. xvi. 13.)

   This title expresses the two ideas that Christ at once belongs to the
   race of humanity, and sustains a peculiar and unique relation to it. It
   may be held to denote Christ's consciousness that He is true and
   perfect Man, that He sustains a universal relation to the race, and
   that He is the Messiah.

   As respects the second title, does it denote an ethical and religious
   relation (so most of the above), or has it also any metaphysical (or,
   as I prefer to say, transcendental) implication? (Beyschlag, Reuss,
   Schmidt, etc.). Is it a tithe which Christ shares with others (in part
   Wendt), or uses in a peculiar and exceptional sense of Himself?
   (Beyschlag, Reuss, Weiss, etc.).

   It will help the understanding of the subject if I sketch a little more
   fully the views of some of the above named writers.

   Beyschlag's view does not hang well together. It begins with a Christ
   who is unique among men--sinless, the Son of God in an absolute sense,
   whose nature is grounded in eternity, who works miracles, is raised
   from the dead, is translated into heavenly power and glory, who has
   Godhead, who demands worship; but who grows only gradually into the
   consciousness of His Messiahship, is limited in nature and gifts, makes
   mistakes, errs in His expectations, etc. Beyschlag's opinions, however,
   contain many notable elements. On the general subject he says, "First
   in a Personality in which the Divine nature translates itself so
   perfectly into the human that it can be said, Who sees Me, sees the
   Father,' can the Divine Revelation perfect itself." [582] The
   God-manhood is "the wonder of all wonders." [583] He separates himself
   from the Church doctrine,. and declares himself in favour of an
   "anthropocentric" Christology, though only on the ground, as he
   explains it, of "a theocentric anthropology," that is, of the view that
   it is the image of God which is the essential thing in the nature of
   man. [584] He rejects Strauss's view, that the sinlessness of Jesus is
   "the death of all true humanity," and contends that "the Christ of
   faith" is no impossibility. [585] The history of the childhood of
   Jesus, at the same time, he resolves into poetry, and thinks the birth
   from a virgin not essential to sinlessness, or to a new beginning of
   humanity. [586] On the self-consciousness of Jesus, he holds that the
   individuality of Jesus had its limitations, but in respect of the
   consciousness of a Divine Sonship was clear and absolute. "It is not
   the old Israelitish religious consciousness which lives in Jesus in
   such all-determining fashion, but a new, till then in the world unheard
   of and perfect consciousness, which not only is still unsurpassed but
   in its inwardness and clearness never can be surpassed." [587] Its
   central point is the consciousness of God as Father, to which the name
   "Son" corresponds. "Sonship to God (Gottessohnschaft) is the peculiar
   expression of the self-consciousness of Jesus." [588] This name
   represents the highest aim, or ideal, for all men, but still there is a
   singularity in its application to Jesus. [589] God was His Father in a
   special sense. "While He calls God not merely His' Father, but names
   Him also the' Father absolutely, and teaches His disciples to pray our
   Father in heaven,' He yet never includes Himself with them under an our
   Father,' but always says My Father' or your Father,' thus
   distinguishing His relation from theirs." [590] This does not mean
   "that He is the first who has recognised and realised this destination
   to a Divine Sonship." It means that, while all others become sons of
   God through a change of disposition--through conversion, the new birth,
   etc.--and not through themselves, but only through Him--His relation to
   the Father is original, perfect, absolute, so that He knows Himself to
   be the object of God's love absolutely. [591] In this is involved His
   sinlessness. [592] This is a necessary pre-supposition of Christian
   faith--the religious, moral absoluteness of Jesus, and the history
   confirms it. [593] If He has not this absolute greatness, He is no
   Saviour of others, but stands in need of salvation Himself. [594] This
   is the "Godhead" of Jesus. "It is never a relative greatness, however
   exalted and super-excellent it may be, but the absolute which is the
   appearance of Godhead in humanity; the religiously and morally perfect,
   and this alone, is in the domain of the human, the truly Divine, in
   which we can believe, and which admits of and demands worship." [595]
   But this religious-moral Godhead of Christ does not stand in opposition
   to a metaphysical. A real being of God in Him lies at the foundation of
   the consciousness of Christ, that which He expresses in the word, "I am
   in the Father and the Father in Me"; so that in Him in whom the eternal
   love has perfectly appeared an essential Godhead also may be
   recognised. [596] The passages in John which seem to imply personal
   pre-existence, Beyschlag explains away by predestination, etc. On the
   Messianic calling, he finds the birth-moment of the Messianic
   consciousness of Jesus in the baptism. [597] He reviews the opinions of
   those who would put it earlier or hater, and finds them untenable.
   [598] But though Christ from this moment knew Himself to be the
   Messiah, He did not know what the course of His Messianic life was to
   be. [599] He had no foreseen plan. "The public life of Jesus began
   under quite other stars than the expectation of the death of the
   Cross." [600] Beyschlag distinguishes three stages in the development
   of Christ's ideas: [601] --

   1. A stage when the kingdom is conceived of as near--standing at the
   door (early ministry in John).

   2. Jesus realises that His people are anything but ready for the
   kingdom; and sees that its triumph will involve a long-protracted
   development (Galilean ministry).

   3. He foresees His death, and the triumph of the kingdom is now
   transported into the future, in connection with a second advent. The
   name "Son of Man," Beyschlag connects with the Messianic dignity (from
   Daniel); but holds that Christ knew and felt Himself also as "the
   heavenly, archetypal (urbildlich). man." [602] The reality of the
   resurrection is strongly defended, and the following explanation is
   given of the ascension. "What, then, was the original thought of the
   ascent to heaven? What else can it have been than that of the elevation
   of Jesus above the limits of the earthly life, of His translation into
   another, supramundane, Divine form of existence,--in a word, of His
   exaltation or glorification?" [603]

   H. Schmidt's article in the Studien und Kritiken, on "The Formation and
   Content of the Messianic Consciousness of Jesus," is an acute criticism
   of the views of Beyschlag and Weiss, and also an able independent
   treatment of the subject. He inquires "first as to the time in which
   Jesus came to the consciousness of His Messianic destination, and then
   what moments His Messianic consciousness comprehended, and what measure
   of clearness there was already present in Him as to the nature of His
   kingdom." [604] As against Weiss, who seeks to lead from the
   consciousness of Christ's unique Son-relationship to the consciousness
   of His Messiahship by way of inference, he argues very powerfully for a
   peculiarity in the self-consciousness of Jesus other than the mere
   sense of a perfect religious relation to the Father. [605] Sonship
   implies a knowledge of the thoughts and love of God to the individual,
   not of God's thoughts or purposes for the world. On the other
   hand--this against Beyschlag--the consciousness of a unique and sinless
   Sonship could not exist without the idea of a unique calling connected
   therewith. [606] For Jesus to know that He was the only sinless Being
   in humanity, was already to know that He had a calling beyond that of a
   Nazarene carpenter. He strongly presses the point that the appearance
   of a perfectly sinless Being in the empirical state of the race is
   scarcely comprehensible by us "without the background of a distinction
   of essence"; [607] and shows that Beyschlag's admission that the
   peculiarity of Christ's Person, as the absolute moral ideal, involves a
   permanent distinction between Him and others, and rests on a
   metaphysical background, is fatal to his "anthropocentric" view, for it
   means that the centre of Christ's Person is in the suprahuman--the
   Divine. [608] He examines the alleged traces of growth in the Messianic
   consciousness of Jesus during His public ministry, and demonstrates how
   weak are the grounds on which this view rests. [609] He holds it to
   have been inconceivable that Jesus should have been in unclearness in
   regard to, at least, "the constitutive moments" of His kingdom, and
   therefore in regard to His death. [610] He combats Weiss's view that
   Jesus thought at first only of Israel, not of a universal kingdom.
   [611] "If at the entrance on His Messianic course, already the kingdoms
   of the world and the glory of them were offered to Him, one would think
   He must have had a wide glimpse into this world." [612] The whole essay
   deserves careful consideration.

   Another critic of current theories is Grau, who thus defines the
   subject in his preface. "The capital question in this domain," he says,
   is, "What Jesus has thought about Himself, His vocation, and the
   significance of His Person?" Another form of the question is, "How is
   the Christ of the Nicene Creed related to the Christ of the New
   Testament, and specially to the Christ of the Synoptics"? [613] He
   criticises very severely the view of H. Schultz, in his work on The
   Godhead of Christ, but along with this, the theories of Beyschlag, etc.
   He quotes Schultz's criticism on the Socinian writers, that they
   ascribed "a become Godhead" (eine gewordene Gottheit) to Christ, and
   asks wherein their view differed from his own, as expressed in the
   following passage: "If we teach the Godhead of Christ, it is that we
   are certain that Jesus, after He has completed His work, has become
   perfectly one with the Christ-idea of God. . . . God has made Him Lord
   and Christ. And so He has also received, as His personal attribute, the
   Godhead which is proper to the Christ. The Christ is for us God. Jesus
   has become God in becoming Christ." [614] The old view, Grau remarks,
   was that "God became man in Jesus Christ"; now the truth of salvation
   is expressed by Schultz and his friends in the proposition, "The man
   Jesus Christ has become God." "This Godhead," he says, "can be no true'
   Godhead, because it is one that has become. So, finally, is this whole
   representation nothing else than what it was with the Socinians--a
   misuse of the name of God." [615] Grau's own book, however, though it
   goes on original lines, can hardly be recommended as a satisfactory
   contribution to the subject. He is often far from concise or clear in
   his statements, and somewhat unmethodical in his treatment. He does not
   systematically investigate the question of Christ's
   self-consciousness--its development, relation to current ideas,
   contents, etc.--but aims rather at proving the thesis that Christ is
   the one who combines in His Messianic calling, all the attributes of
   Jehovah in the Old Testament. An elaborate discussion of the tithe "Son
   of Man" sums itself up in the following remark:--"This is the (title)
   Son of Man, the grasping together and fulfilment of all the offices m
   the kingdom of God which lie side by side in the Old Testament, and
   complete each other--those of shepherd, physician, priest (but also of
   sacrifice), of prophet, of king, and judge." [616]

   A much more thorough discussion of the subject is Baldensperger's
   recent work on The Self-Consciousness of Jesus in the Light of the
   Messianic Hopes of His Time. Baldensperger will have nothing to say to
   the "ideal man" theory--which he ridicules as an attempt to carry back
   our nineteenth-century ideas into a period to which they were quite
   strange--and treats the title "Son of Man" as simply a designation for
   the Messiah. [617] Yet his general view is exposed to the same
   objections as Beyschlag's. He makes Jesus first arrive dimly at the
   feeling that He is Messiah; then, aroused by John's preaching and
   baptised, He reaches religious assurance (but still expecting,
   according to the ideas of the time, signs in confirmation of His call);
   He is perplexed (the Temptation); after this, He gains clearness, yet
   not such absolute certainty as warrants Him in publicly proclaiming
   Himself; ultimately he attains to this certainty, and at the same time
   sees that His victory is only to be secured through death, and now
   looks for the completion of the kingdom of God through the Parousia and
   last judgment, etc. [618] It is obvious how much of all this is mere
   theory, without corroboration in the history. To mention only one
   objection--according to Baldensperger, Christ did not announce Himself
   as Messiah till the time of Peter's confession, [619] while yet the
   name "Son of Man," which Baldensperger takes to be quite equivalent to
   Messiah, is on His lips in the Gospels from the first. [620] To avoid
   this difficulty, the critic has no alternative but arbitrarily to
   change the order of the sections, and to assume that all those
   incidents in which this name occurs, took place after Peter's
   confession--a violent and unwarrantable hypothesis. [621] It is a
   weakness of Baldensperger's theory that it fluctuates between a view
   according to which Jesus is certain of Himself, and another according
   to which He is in doubt and perplexity. Surely, if there is one thing
   clearer in the Gospels than another, it is that Christ is quite certain
   of Himself from the beginning. Not to build on this expression "Son of
   Man," can we listen to the tone of authority in the Sermon on the
   Mount, and doubt it? The hypothesis of a wavering and fluctuating
   consciousness totally lacks support in the Gospel narrative. Had Christ
   any doubt of Himself when He answered John's messengers, when He chose
   the twelve apostles, when He invited the labouring and heavy laden to
   come to Him for rest, when He said, "All things are delivered to Me of
   My Father," etc.? [622] One thing which Baldensperger totally fails to
   show us is, what amount of reliance we are to place in self-beliefs of
   Christ, arrived at by the psychological methods he indicates, through
   contact with the apocalyptic notions of the time, etc. In other words,
   what objective value have these beliefs of Christ for us--His beliefs,
   e.g., about His atoning death, His Parousia, the judgment of the world,
   etc.? Apparently Baldensperger attaches great religious weight to these
   beliefs, stripped at least of their immediate form, yet it is not easy
   to see on what grounds he can do so. He leaves wholly undetermined,
   besides, Christ's relation to His miracles, to the resurrection, etc.,
   without which, surely, His self-witness is not set in its right light.

   I would refer, finally, to the important discussion of these subjects
   in Wendt's able and exhaustive work on The Doctrine of Jesus. In this
   book Wendt subjects the opinions of Beyschlag and Baldensperger, as to
   a change in Christ's views of His kingdom, to a careful criticism, and
   arrives at the con: elusion that, in all essential respects, Christ's
   views of the nature and coming of His kingdom as a present, spiritual,
   gradually developing reality on earth, remained unchanged during the
   period of His ministry. [623] He holds, however, that this does not
   apply to the details of the development; and grants, in agreement with
   the others, that at the beginning of His work Christ had no thought of
   the necessity of His death, not to speak of so speedy and frightful a
   death. [624] The difference of the two views, therefore, resolves
   itself into one of degree, for unless it is held that Christ's death
   had no essential relation to the nature of His kingdom, and the manner
   of its setting up, it is impossible to say that ignorance in regard to
   that event did not affect the conception of the kingdom. Wendt, like
   Beyschlag, holds that the baptism was the moment of the miraculous
   revelation to Christ of His Messiahship, though He finds this prepared
   for in His previous consciousness of standing in an inner communion of
   love with His heavenly Father. "In this consciousness was given the
   psychological pre-supposition for His gaining the certainty of His own
   Messiahship, and therewith, at the same time, obtaining a new, higher
   knowledge of the nature and coming of the kingdom of God. But,
   previously to the baptism, this conclusion from His inner fellowship
   with God as His Son was to Him still not clear." [625] On the meaning
   of the name "Son of Man," Wendt argues strongly for the view that this
   title designates Christ as a weak, creaturely being--member, Messiah
   though He was, of the weak, creaturely race of humanity. [626] This
   view, in turn, is ably criticised by Baldensperger in the work noticed
   above. [627] It cannot be carried through without doing violence to
   many passages in which this name is evidently used by Christ as a tithe
   of dignity; the highest Messianic functions being claimed by him, not
   (as Wendt's argument would require) despite of His being Son of Man but
   because He is Son of Man. [628] In general, Wendt's ideas of Jesus and
   His teaching are very high. "My interest in the historical treatment of
   the teaching of Jesus," he says, "arises from the conviction that the
   historical Jesus Christ, in His annunciation, by word and deed, of the
   kingdom of God, was the perfect Revelation of God to men"; and again,
   "We recognise in His teaching concerning the kingdom of God the highest
   and perfect Revelation of God." [629] On the other hand, this high
   estimate is limited by the admission that on everything but the one
   peculiar point of His own mission--the founding of the kingdom of
   God--Jesus simply occupied the standpoint, and used the language, of
   His contemporaries. His views of the natural world--e.g. of the Old
   Testament, of angels and devils, of the future world, etc.--were simply
   those of His age, and liable to all the error and imperfection of the
   time. [630] But then the question cannot help arising, If Jesus is
   avowedly wrong on all points where a scientific view of the world is
   concerned, how are we to trust Him when He speaks to us of supernatural
   and supersensible realities? May not His own words be applied, "If I
   have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe
   if I tell you of heavenly things?" [631] There need be no dispute as to
   what Dr. Wendt says of the religious ideas of Christ, of His spiritual
   conception of the kingdom of God, of His doctrine of the Divine
   Fatherhood, of His pure and exalted doctrine of righteousness. The
   sceptic would admit it all. He would only question whether, with the
   altered view of the world which has arisen since Christ's time, such
   doctrines are tenable now as sober, objective truth. And to answer that
   question satisfactorily, firmer ground must be taken up in regard to
   Christ's consciousness as a whole. Dr. Wendt's book is, in many
   respects, a richly instructive one, full of suggestive points, but it
   lacks the means of guarding Christianity against the subjectivity which
   would grant to it every kind of moral worth and beauty, but would deny
   its objective truth as Revelation.

LECTURE VII.

  THE HIGHER CONCEPT OF GOD INVOLVED IN THE INCARNATION--
  THE INCARNATION AND THE PLAN OF THE WORLD.

    Introductory

   The point reached at the conclusion of last Lecture was that the facts
   of Christ's Revelation are reconcilable with no lower estimate of His
   Person than that which we find in the apostolic writings. This
   conclusion is counterchecked by the circumstance that, in the history
   of doctrine, no lower estimate of Christ's Person has been found able
   to maintain itself.

   Theories, therefore, like that of Ritschl, which ascribe "Godhead" to
   Christ only in a figurative way, or like those of Rothe and Beyschlag,
   which aim at investing Christ with a real Divinity, but deny His
   personal pre-existence, are none of them in full harmony with Scripture
   testimony. The former sinks back into humanitarianism; the latter
   involve themselves in the difficulty that they must suppose a new
   Divine person to come into existence in the Incarnation. They literally
   add a new Person to the Godhead. This difficulty is not obviated by
   taking the predicate "Divinity" in a quasi-ideal sense to denote simply
   the ethical indwelling of God in Christ. There is no doubt a true
   presence of the Divine in Christ, just as there is a true presence of
   God by His Spirit in the heart of every believer; and what is
   imperfectly true of the believer may be held to be perfectly true of
   Christ. But no matter how entirely the believer is filled with the
   Divine life, and in this sense is a partaker of the Divine nature, we
   do not regard this as a reason for worshipping him. We may worship and
   glorify the God revealed in him, but we do not worship the believer
   himself. The worship paid to Christ, therefore, and that from the
   earliest period, marks a distinction between His Divinity and that of
   every other. Not simply as the possessor of a communicated Divine
   nature, but in the root of His own Personality, Christ was Divine.

    I. Higher concept of God involved in the Incarnation--God as triune.

   I. I come now to speak of the higher concept of God involved in this
   truth of the Incarnation--I mean the concept of God as triune. This is
   the first of the corollaries of the doctrine of the Incarnation, taken
   in connection with the related doctrine of the Spirit. It must be
   evident to any one who thinks upon it, that such a doctrine as that of
   the Incarnation cannot be seriously entertained without profoundly
   reacting upon and modifying our concept of God. Necessity is laid on
   us, as it was laid on the early Church, to reconstruct our concept of
   God so as to bring it into harmony with the new and higher Revelation
   which has been given us. The result is the Trinitarian view, which
   Christendom expresses in the formula--Father, Son, and Spirit, one God;
   and which is as essentially bound up with Christianity as the
   Incarnation itself. [632]

   Here let me say, to begin with, that it is a mistake to shrink from the
   triune view of God as if it did nothing else than impose a mysterious
   burden on our faith,--as if it had no voice to reason, or brought no
   light into our view of the world, or had no practical relation to
   Christian life. This doctrine has not been gained indeed by
   speculation, but by induction from the facts of God's
   self-revelation,--just, e.g., as the man of science gains his knowledge
   of the polarity of the magnet by induction from the facts of nature.
   Yet it is not a doctrine which the Church, having once gained it, could
   ever again willingly part with. Even from a philosophical point of
   view, the worth of this doctrine is very great. The more profoundly
   speculation has occupied itself with the mystery of the Divine
   existence, the more impossible has it been found to rest in the thought
   of God as an abstract, distinctionless unity, the more has the triune
   conception of God been felt to be necessary to secure the life, love,
   personality,--even the Fatherhood of God. Professor Flint says of this
   doctrine, that it is "a mystery indeed, yet one which explains many
   other mysteries, and which sheds a marvellous light on God, on nature,
   and on man." [633] Professor Laidlaw says of it, "This doctrine is one
   of the most prolific and far-reaching among the discoveries of
   Revelation. Fully to receive it influences every part of our
   theological system, and of our practical religion. It is the
   consummation and the only perfect protection of Theism." [634]
   Martensen has declared, "If Christian dogmatics had not asserted and
   developed the doctrine of the Trinity, ethics must postulate it in its
   own interests." [635] Similar testimonies might be multiplied
   indefinitely.

   It is well to keep clearly in view how this doctrine has originated. It
   has just been said that the doctrine of the Trinity is not a result of
   mere speculation,--not a theory or hypothesis spun by theologians out
   of their own fancies,--still less, as some eminent writers would
   maintain, the result of the importation of Greek metaphysics into
   Christian theology. [636] It is, in the first instance, the result of a
   simple process of induction from the facts of the Christian Revelation.
   We could know nothing positively of this self-distinction in the nature
   of God save as He Himself discovers it to us in the facts of His
   self-revelation; we do not know it through the discovery of Himself as
   Father, Son, and Spirit. We know it just as, e.g., we know of the
   existence of reason, memory, imagination, will, etc., in our own minds,
   through their actual manifestations; or as we know of the various modes
   of force in nature--light, heat, electricity, chemical force,
   etc.--through observation of their workings. Our faith in the Trinity
   does not rest even on the proof-texts which are adduced from the
   Scriptures in support of the Trinitarian distinction. [637] These. have
   their value as summaries of the truth we gain from the complex of facts
   of the New Testament Revelation, and serve to assure us that we are on
   right lines in our interpretation of these facts, but the fundamental
   ground on which we rest is the facts themselves. The triune conception
   of God is justified when it is shown to be the conception which
   underlies the triune Revelation God has given of Himself, and the
   triune activity in the work of Redemption.

   For this same reason that the doctrine of the Trinity is one which
   properly arises only out of the facts of the completed Revelation in
   the New Testament, we do not look, or we look in vain, for any full
   discovery of it in the Old Testament. Yet, if the doctrine be true, we
   would anticipate that the older dispensation would not be without at
   least some foregleams or intimations of it,--that some facts which
   point in its direction would not be wanting,--and this we find to be
   actually the case. It is only, I think, a very superficial view of the
   Old Testament which will allow us to say that no such traces exist. I
   do not lay any stress upon the plural word "Elohim," or on the plural
   pronouns sometimes associated with it, though this word is an
   indication of the deep feeling which the Hebrews had for that plurality
   of powers in the Divine nature, which Polytheism separated, and
   worshipped in isolation, or under some visible manifestation (sky,
   etc.). It is this which constitutes the Monotheism of the Bible from
   the first a living thing, and keeps it from degenerating into a hard,
   unspiritual monadism. More to the purpose is the large place allowed in
   the Old Testament to ideas and representations which naturally and
   almost necessarily suggest--if indeed they do not sometimes formally
   express--the thought of self-distinction in the Divine nature. I might
   refer here (1) to the remarkable series of facts connected in the older
   Scriptures with the appearances and Revelations of the "Angel of
   Jehovah." [638] Discussion goes on to this day as to whether the
   mysterious Being who bears this designation in the older narratives of
   the Bible is to be viewed as a mere theophany, or as a created angel,
   or as a distinct hypostasis; [639] but I think a dispassionate review
   of all the facts will dispose us to agree with Oehler that, judged by
   his manifestations, the "Mal'ach" is best described as "a
   self-presentation of Jehovah, entering into the sphere of the creature,
   which is one in essence with Jehovah, and yet again different from
   Him." [640] (2) We have again the very full development given to the
   doctrine of the Spirit. Ordinarily the Spirit appears only as a power
   or energy proceeding from Jehovah, but in function and operation the
   tendency is to represent Him as an independent agent, and there are
   several passages, especially in the later chapters of Isaiah, where
   this view receives distinct expression. Such, e.g., is Isa. xl. 13,
   "Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or, being His counsellor,
   bath taught Him?" where, in Oehler's words, "The Divine Spirit acting
   in creation is a consciously working and intelligent power." [641]
   Cheyne observes on the same passage: "In Isaiah there is a marked
   tendency to hypostatise the Spirit: here, for instance, consciousness
   and intelligence are distinctly predicated of the Spirit." [642] (3)
   There is in the later books the doctrine of the Divine Wisdom, which in
   the Jewish and Alexandrian schools developed into the view of a
   distinct hypostasis. Still, whatever the measure of these
   approximations, it was not till the actual appearance of the Son in the
   flesh, and till the actual outpouring of the Spirit consequent on
   Christ's exaltation, that the facts were available which gave this
   doctrine a distinct place in the faith of the Church.

   The doctrine of the Trinity is first of all a doctrine of distinctions
   interior to the Divine essence, and as such it has frequently been
   objected to on the ground that it asks us to accept an intellectual
   puzzle, or to believe in an intellectual contradiction--that three can
   be one, and one be three. No objection is more common than this, yet
   none is more baseless--more narrowly the product of the mere logical
   understanding. [643] The objection does not turn peculiarly on the
   point of the attribution of Personality to the three modes of existence
   in the Godhead--to call them such for the present--but simply on the
   formal contradiction of "one and three." But what is there to which the
   same objection would not apply? What is there which is not at the same
   time one and manifold? Take any object--it can only be conceived of as
   unity of substance, yet plurality of attributes. Take mind--it is one,
   if anything is, yet we distinguish in it a variety of powers--reason,
   memory, imagination, will, etc.--a plurality of faculties, yet all
   expressions of the one undivided spiritual self. Take any form of
   life--what an unfolding into multiplicity have we there of what is in
   its principle one. Is it not the very essence of life to unfold and
   maintain itself in the play of distinctions? Take a yet higher view,
   and the same contradiction meets us--if contradiction it is--in any
   explanation we may give of the ultimate ground of the universe. However
   we may choose to conceive of it, the many must in some way have come
   out of the One,--that One, accordingly, must have in it a plurality of
   powers, must be thought of as capable of expressing, or unfolding, or
   differentiating itself into a manifold. This is as true on the
   pantheistic hypothesis, or on Mr. Spencer's theory of an Unknowable
   Power, which manifests itself in matter and mind, or on any of the
   monistic systems,--Haeckel's or Hartmann's, for example,--as in the
   Christian doctrine. It will be remembered how this question was one of
   the difficulties discussed in the early Greek schools, and what came of
   the attempts of the Eleatics and others to hold fast the unity of the
   Absolute in contrast to all distinctions. From the idea of one absolute
   distinctionless unity, excluding all plurality, all change, all
   mobility, all decay, came the relegation of the world of perception to
   the category of mere seeming, show, unreality, non-being--in brief, the
   denial of the reality of the existing world, or Acosmism. [644] It was
   in the attempt to overcome this difficulty that philosophy from Plato
   downwards felt the need of a conception of God which should embrace the
   element of self-distinction. Hence the Logos speculations of the Stoics
   and of Philo, the nous of the Neo-Platonists. In hike manner,
   self-diremption, self-distinction in God, is the key to all the higher
   speculative movements of the present century. Whether these speculative
   views be held to be satisfactory or not, they have at least served to
   show that the Trinitarian conception, instead of being the shallow
   thing it is sometimes represented to be, includes elements of the
   deepest speculative importance. [645]

   It is not, therefore, to the mere fact that Christianity posits
   self-distinctions in God, but to the nature of these distinctions as
   personal, that the real objections to the doctrine of the Trinity must
   be addressed. And this is the point on which, within the Church itself,
   discussion on the nature of the Trinity really turns. What is the
   character of this distinction which we must ascribe to God, which
   exhaustively expresses, or does full justice to, the facts of the
   Christian Revelation? Is it a distinction of essence, or only of
   working? an immanent distinction, or one only of Revelation? a personal
   distinction, or one which is impersonal? Now, in applying this word
   "Person" to these distinctions in the Godhead, it is granted that we
   are conscious of inevitable limitations and drawbacks. The objection
   commonly made to the word is that it represents the Godhead as
   constituted by three separate individualities, as distinct from each
   other as human beings are distinct,--a conception which would, of
   course, be fatal to the Divine unity. This word Person, it is to be
   observed, does not occur in Scripture itself. [646] It comes to us from
   the Latin, while the Greek Church employed the term hupostasis, or
   substance; so that, as Augustine says, the Greeks spoke of one essence,
   three substances, but the Latins of one substance, three Persons, while
   yet both meant the same thing. [647] The same father even says, "Three
   Persons, if they are to be. so called, for the unspeakable exaltedness
   of the object cannot be set forth by this term," [648] and he reminds
   us of what I have just stated, that Scripture does not anywhere mention
   three Persons. [649] Too much stress, therefore, must not be laid on
   the mere term. Yet I do not know any word which would so well express
   the idea which we wish to convey, and which the titles Father, Son, and
   Spirit seem to imply--the existence in the Divine nature of three
   mutually related yet distinct centres of knowledge, love, and will, not
   existing apart as human individualities do, but in and through each
   other as moments in one Divine self-conscious life.

   Using the term "Person," therefore, to denote distinctions in the
   Divine nature, properly described as I and Thou and He, without
   contradiction of the thought of the comprehension of these distinctions
   in a higher unity of essence, we certainly hold that the distinctions
   in the Christian Trinity are personal. This is already implied, as just
   hinted, in the names given to the members of the Trinitarian
   circle--Father, Son, and Spirit--at least the two former are personal,
   and for that very reason the third is presumably so also. But, apart
   from this, all those facts and testimonies which go to show that in
   Christ we have the Incarnation of a true Divine Person, distinct from
   the Father, establish this truth; while, finally, all the facts and
   testimonies which show that the Holy Spirit, sent forth by Christ as
   the Guide, Teacher, Comforter, and Sanctifier of His disciples, is a
   Divine Person, distinct from the Father and the Son, support the same
   view. I do not enlarge on this series of testimonies relating to the
   Spirit, for the reason that few who admit a real personal distinction
   in regard to the Son are disposed to deny it in regard to the Spirit.
   It has, indeed, been said, and with justice, that in regard to the Son
   the dispute has not been as to His Personality, but as to His Divinity;
   while in regard to the Spirit the dispute has not been as to His
   Divinity but as to His Personality. Yet it is a rare thing to find
   those who admit the Personality and Divinity of the Son denying the
   Personality of the Spirit; rather it is felt that if the distinction of
   Father and Son is admitted there is a necessity for completing the
   triad in the Divine life by the acknowledgment of the Spirit also. The
   other view of a merely modal or economical Trinity--a Trinity, that is,
   not of essence, but only of Revelation--has had many advocates both in
   ancient and modern times, but falls to the ground if a true Incarnation
   of the Son be admitted. [650] It is, besides, loaded with difficulties
   and contradictions of its own, which make it, whenever the matter is
   thought out, untenable as an hypothesis. In the old Sabellian view, for
   example, we had indeed a Divine Christ, but the distinction between
   Father and Son was abolished, because it was the same being who first
   appeared as Father, who afterwards appeared as Son. Modern theories
   escape this difficulty by ascribing to Christ only an ethical
   Sonship--that is, by denying His true Divinity; but this in turn
   deprives us of even a Trinity of Revelation. We have now God the Father
   and God the Spirit, but no longer, in the proper sense, God the Son.
   The Son is the bearer or medium of the Revelation of the Father, but
   does not Himself belong to the Divine circle. Or suppose that with
   Rothe and Beyschlag we seek to save Christ's Divinity by asserting a
   "becoming" Godhead, then we involve ourselves in the old dilemma, that
   to complete the Trinitarian circle we add a new Person to the Godhead,
   and the Trinity is no longer economical. The only way of clearing
   ourselves of these entanglements is to hold fast to the scriptural idea
   of the true entrance of a Divine Personal Being--the Eternal Son--into
   the conditions of humanity; and, in accordance with this, to move back
   from an economical to an ontological and personal Trinity. [651]

   The question is now to be considered, How does this doctrine stand
   related to rational thought and to experience? It may: be thought that
   at the best this doctrine is one to be received as a mystery of faith,
   that it can bring no light or help to the intellect, and that in point
   of simplicity and clearness it compares unfavourably with the Unitarian
   view. This, however, if the doctrine of the Trinity is true, is most
   unlikely; and I confess to have a great dislike to doctrines which are
   supposed to come to us in the form of absolute mysteries, and to have
   no point of contact with thought through which some ray of rational
   light may break in upon them. In proof that the Trinitarian view is not
   without relation to thought, I might appeal to the fact that it is to
   the influence of philosophical thought on Christianity that many would
   attribute the rise of such a doctrine in the Church at all. It is
   certainly not without meaning that, as already remarked, in the attempt
   to explain the Revelation of God to the world, we should see a Logos
   doctrine springing up in the schools of Alexandria; should find at a
   later period the Neo-Platonists developing on Platonic principles
   something like a doctrine of the Trinity; should find in the
   deep-reaching speculations of BÃ¶hme in the seventeenth century, [652]
   and in the modern speculative philosophies, the self-diremption of God
   as an essential feature. These speculative constructions are sometimes
   far enough removed from the pure Christian view, but they have a value
   as bringing clearly to. light the reality of a threefold pulse or
   movement, involved in the very nature of thought, and the fact that the
   life of Spirit only maintains itself through this triple movement of
   distinction of self from other, and the resolution of this distinction
   in a higher unity. These thoughts of the speculative philosophy I
   heartily accept, and believe them to be in deepest harmony with
   Christian doctrine. [653]

   The attempts met with in Augustine and others to find an image of the
   Trinity in the constitution of the soul, need not detain us here.
   Augustine's ingenious analysis of the mind's relation to its own
   knowledge, and of both to its love of itself,--of the relations of
   memory, understanding, and will,--his comparison of the Divine Word to
   our own inner and mental word, and of the Holy Spirit to hove,--have
   profounder elements in them than is always recognised; but he himself
   is quite conscious of the imperfection of the analogies, and especially
   of the fact that what they give us is a Trinity of powers and functions
   in the one Person, and not a Trinity of personal distinctions. [654] If
   I were disposed to look for a shadow of such distinctions in our own
   mental life, I am not sure but that I would seek it, as Augustine also
   hints, in that mysterious power which the soul has of dialogue with
   itself,--in that indrawn, ideal life of the spirit, when the mind,
   excluding the outward world,' holds converse and argument with
   itself--divides itself as it were within itself, and holds discussion
   with itself, putting its questions and answering them, proposing
   difficulties and solving them, offering objections and repelling
   them,--all the while remaining, as we may say, in a third capacity the
   neutral spectator of itself, taking watchful note of what is advanced
   on both sides of the debate, and passing favourable or unfavourable
   judgment on the issues. Yet, after all, this trilogy is only shadow,
   and, in conjunction with other elements of our spiritual life, can but
   faintly suggest to us what, if the distinction went deeper, Trinity
   might mean.

   We get more help when, leaving the ground of purely psychological
   analogies, we proceed to inquire into the conditions under which, so
   far as our thought can go, self-consciousness, personality, love, are
   possible. Here we begin to see the positive philosophical and
   theological value of this concept of God. There are several points of
   view from which its advantage over the Unitarian view of God becomes
   apparent.

   1. First of all, there is the bearing of this doctrine on the Divine
   self-consciousness--on knowledge and Personality in God. The relation
   of knowledge seems necessarily to imply a distinction of subject and
   object. Philosophers have spoken of a transcendental kind of knowledge
   which is above this distinction,--in which subject and object melt into
   one. But their words convey no idea to the mind. The only kind of
   knowledge we are capable of conceiving is one in which the subject
   distinguishes himself from some object which is not himself, and
   through this distinction returns to knowledge of himself and of his own
   states. In our own case, this knowledge of self is mediated through
   knowledge of the outward world, and in the highest degree through
   intercourse with our fellow human beings. Seizing on this analogy, some
   have thought that the Divine consciousness might be conceived of as
   mediated by the idea of the world. [655] The idea of the world in this
   view takes the place of the Son in the orthodox theology. The
   objections to this are--

   (1) It makes God dependent on the world, the idea of which is necessary
   for the realisation of His self-consciousness.

   (2) The object in this case is an ideal one, and this seems inadequate
   to mediate a real self - consciousness. Hegel is consistent,
   accordingly, if this theory is to be adopted, in making not the idea of
   the world, but the world itself, the object through which the Divine
   Spirit attains to self-consciousness.

   (3) The world is a finite object, and cannot be an adequate means for
   the mediation of an infinite self-consciousness. [656]

   (4) Finally, the world is not a personal object. But the true depths of
   personality are only sounded when the "I" knows itself in
   contradistinction from and in reciprocal relations with a "Thou"--a
   counter-self to its own. [657]

   The result we reach by this line of thought is that we can only secure
   the reality of the Divine self-consciousness by regarding it as
   complete in itself--apart from the idea of the world; and this can only
   be done by positing an immanent distinction in the Godhead, through
   which the Divine consciousness carries its object within itself; and
   this neither an ideal, nor finite, nor impersonal object, but One in
   whom God sees His own personal image perfectly expressed,--who, in
   Scripture language, is "the effulgence of His glory, and the very image
   of His substance" (hupostasis). [658] The value of the doctrine of the
   Trinity from this point of view is very evident. The third moment--that
   which corresponds to the Holy Spirit--is more difficult to arrive at d
   priori, but one feels the need of it to complete the circle of the
   Divine life in bringing to light the unity which underlies the previous
   distinction. [659]

   2. A more familiar deduction is that from Divine love. Here, in
   realising what is involved in Divine love, we feel, quite as strongly
   as in the case of the Divine Personality, the need of sell-distinction.
   The proof of the Trinity from hove-- if proof it can be called--is a
   favourite one with theologians. [660] "God is love." [661] But love is
   self-communication to another. There cannot be love without an object
   to be loved. If, therefore, God is essentially love, this is in other
   words to say that He has from eternity an object of His love. This
   object cannot be the world--ideally or really--for the reason already
   given, that this would be to make God dependent on the world,--to make
   the world, indeed, an essential moment in God's life,--whereas the true
   doctrine is that God has love in its fulness in Himself, and out of
   that fulness of hove, loves the world. [662] The world, besides, is a
   finite object, and could not be an adequate object for the infinite
   love of God. If, therefore, God is love in Himself--in His own eternal
   and transcendent being--He must have in some way within Himself the
   perfect and eternal object of His love--which is just the Scripture
   doctrine of the Son. This view of God is completed in the perfect
   communion the Divine Persons have with each other through the Holy
   Spirit--the bond and medium of their love.

   To see the importance of this view, we have but to contrast it with its
   opposite, and to ask, What can love in God mean on the supposition of
   His absolute solitariness? What can be the object of God's love
   throughout eternity, if there is no triune distinction in God? What can
   it be but Himself? Instead of love, therefore, as we understand
   it,--affection going out to another,--what we have in the universe is
   an infinite solitary Ego; a Being who loves Himself only, as, indeed,
   there is no other to love. Either, therefore, we must come back to seek
   an object for God's love in the finite, created world, or recognise
   that God has an infinitely blessed life of love within Himself, and
   this brings us to the doctrine of an immanent Trinity. The value of the
   doctrine in an ethical aspect is seen when we recognise that only
   through the Trinitarian distinction are we brought into communion with
   a Being who has within Himself a life of communion.

   3. Connected with this as a third point of view--though it is really
   only an extension of the foregoing--is a deduction from the Divine
   Fatherhood. God, is Father. This is Christ's own new name for Him, and
   expresses His relation to those who stand in moral dependence on Him,
   and who bear His image. But Father and Son are terms of relation. [663]
   If, then, God be Father, where shall we find the Son who corresponds
   with this relation? If we say, men, created angels, creatures of any
   kind, we are led to this, that Fatherhood in God depended on there
   being a creation. God is not Father simply as God. Fatherhood is not of
   His very essence. This could not easily be better put than it has been
   by Mr. R. H. Hutton, in a well-known essay on the Incarnation in his
   volume of Theological Essays. "If Christ is the eternal Son of God," he
   says, "God is indeed and in essence a Father; the social nature, the
   spring of love, is of the very essence of the Eternal Being; the
   communication of His life, the reciprocation of His affection, dates
   from beyond time--belongs, in other words, to the very being of God.
   . . . The Unitarian conviction that God is--as God and in His eternal
   essence--a single, solitary Personality . . . thoroughly realised,
   renders it impossible to identify any of the social attributes with His
   real essence--renders it difficult not to regard power as the true root
   of all other Divine life. If we are to believe that the Father was from
   all time, we must believe that He was as a Father,--that is, that love
   was actual in Him as well as potential, that the communication of life
   and thought and fulness of joy was of the inmost nature of God, and
   never began to be, if God never began to be." [664]

   4. Finally, this doctrine of the Trinity has a profound bearing on the
   relation of God to the world. Not without reason does Scripture connect
   the Son with the creation, and give His person and His work a cosmical
   significance. We may conceive of God in two relations to the
   world--either in His absolute transcendence over it, which is the
   deistic conception, or as immanently identified with it, which is the
   pantheistic conception. Or we may conceive of Him as at the same time
   exalted above the world--transcending it, and yet present in it as its
   immanent sustaining ground, which is the Christian conception. It was
   to maintain this double relation to the world that, as we have seen,
   Philo conceived of the Logos as a middle term between God and the
   creation, and the Neo-Platonists distinguished between God, the nous,
   and the soul of the world. When a middle term is wanting, we have
   either, as in the later Judaism and Mohammedanism, an abstract and
   immobile Monotheism; or, in recoil from this, a losing of God in the
   world in Pantheism. In the Christian doctrine of the triune God we have
   the necessary safeguards against both of these errors, and at the same
   time the link between God and the world supplied which speculation
   vainly strove to find. [665] The Christian view is, therefore, the true
   protection of a living Theism, which otherwise oscillates uncertainly
   between these two extremes of Deism and Pantheism, either of which is
   fatal to it. [666]

    II. The Scripture view brings creation and Redemption into
    line--consequences of this.

   II. It is a special service of the doctrine of the Trinity, from the
   point of view we have now reached, that it brings creation and
   Redemption into line, teaching us to look on creation and Redemption as
   parts of one grand whole, and on Christ, now exalted to supreme
   dominion in the universe, as at once the first-born of creation and the
   first-born from the dead. [667] This thought of the Son as the link
   between God and creation--which is so prominent a thought in the New
   Testament--forms the transition to the other subject on which I propose
   to speak in this Lecture--the relation of the Incarnation to the plan
   of the world. The Revelation of the Trinity is given in the work of
   Redemption, but once given we can see that it has its bearings also on
   the work of creation. This is the view of all the leading writers in
   the New Testament,--of Paul, of John, of the author of the Epistle to
   the Hebrews,--who go back, or reason back, to an original agency of the
   Son in the creation of the world. [668] Even the Apocalypse speaks of
   Christ as "the beginning (arche, or principle) of the creation of God."
   [669] But once started on this line, it is impossible to shut one's
   eyes to the question which inevitably arises, and which has so
   frequently been discussed in the history of theology--more keenly than
   ever in modern theology--Did an Incarnation lie in the original plan of
   the world? Would there have been an Incarnation had man never fallen?
   Has the Incarnation any relation to the original ends for which the
   world was made? Or is the Incarnation connected solely with the
   entrance of sin and the need of Redemption?

   To raise a question of this kind at all may be thought by many to
   savour of idle and presumptuous speculation. It may be thought that it
   is one which the Scripture directly and expressly settles in the
   negative, in connecting the Incarnation so intimately as it does with
   God's great purpose of salvation to our race--making it, indeed, the
   crowning proof of His love to sinners that He has sent His
   only-begotten Son into the world, that the world might live through
   Him. [670] There are, however, certain considerations which should give
   us pause before coming too hastily to this conclusion.

   1. The first is that this is a question which does rise naturally out
   of so transcendent a fact as the Incarnation.

   2. It is a question which has forced itself on the mind of the Church,
   and has been deeply and reverently discussed by its ablest thinkers for
   centuries. It is a view which the late Principal Fairbairn, who reasons
   against it, admits undoubtedly to include among its defenders "some of
   the most learned theologians of the present day." [671]

   3. But, mainly, the theory referred to is one not unsuggested by
   certain of the teachings of Scripture. The same objection which is
   taken to this--that it lies outside the field of view of
   Redemption--may be made against the Scripture statements as to the
   relation of the Son to creation; but it is the grandeur of the
   Christian view that, starting with our primary necessities as sinners,
   it opens up principles and views fertile and far-reaching vastly beyond
   their original application.

   It is unnecessary for my purpose to enter at any length into the
   history of the question. A sketch of it may be seen in Dorner's History
   of the Doctrine of the Person of Jesus Christ, [672] or in the
   finely-toned essay on the subject, entitled "The Gospel of Creation,"
   appended to Bishop Westcott's Commentary on the Epistles of St. John.
   These writers, with Archbishop Trench, in his Cambridge University
   Sermons, take the view that the Incarnation was not conditioned by
   human sin; and the same view is held by Rothe, Lange, Oosterzee,
   Martensen, Ebrard, and a large number of other theologians. The
   opposite view is stated with great temperateness and force by Principal
   Fairbairn in the fourth edition of his valuable work on the Typology of
   Scripture. [673] It may perhaps be found as the result of a brief
   consideration of the subject, that the truth does not lie exclusively
   on either side in this profound and difficult controversy, but that a
   higher point of view is possible from which the opposition disappears.

   The strong point in favour of the view that the Incarnation is
   conditioned solely by human sin, is the fact that in Scripture it is
   represented invariably in this connection. I need not quote many
   passages in illustration of this statement. "The Son of Man came to
   seek and to save that which was lost." [674] "God so loved the world
   that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him
   should not perish, but have eternal life." [675] "God sent forth His
   Son, born of a woman, born under the law, that He might redeem them
   which were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."
   [676] "To this end was the Son of God manifested, that He might destroy
   the works of the devil." [677] These and numerous other Scriptures
   explicitly associate Christ's coming with man's Redemption Christ is
   the unspeakable gift of God's love to men for their salvation.

   On the other hand, it is argued that, while the Scripture thus directly
   connects the Incarnation with the work of Redemption, it leaves room
   for, and contains passages which necessarily suggest, a wider view.
   Such are the passages already referred to, which throw light on the
   original relation of the Son to creation--which declare that all things
   were made by Him, that all things consist or hold together in Him, that
   He is the firstborn of all creation--above all, that all things were
   created for Him--that, in the? language of Dr. Lightfoot, "the Word is
   the final cause as well as the creative agent of the universe"--"not
   only the arche but also the telos of creation, not only the first but
   also the last in the history of the universe." [678] These past ages I
   shall advert to again. It is further argued--and this is a point on
   which great stress is laid--that an event of such tremendous magnitude
   as the Incarnation cannot be regarded as a mere contingency in the
   universe; that if it was in view at all, it must have governed the
   whole plan of creation; and that, in point of fact, it is through it
   that, according to Scripture, the creation does reach its end--not only
   redeemed humanity, but all things, both in heaven and in earth, being
   ultimately gathered up into Christ as Head. [679] A plan of such vast
   extent cannot, it is held, be conceived of as an afterthought,--as
   something grafted on creation outside its original design,--it must
   have lain in the original design itself.

   It seems to me that the real source of difficulty in thinking on this
   subject lies in not grasping with sufficient firmness the fact that,
   however we may distinguish from our human point of view between parts
   and aspects of the Divine plan, God's plan is in reality one, and it is
   but an abstract way of thinking which leads us to suppose otherwise. In
   our human way of apprehension, we speak as if God had first one plan of
   creation--complete and rounded off in itself--in which sin was to have
   no place; then, when it was foreseen that sin would enter, another plan
   was introduced, which vitally altered and enlarged the former. But if
   we take a sufficiently high point of view, we shall be compelled to
   conclude, I think, that the plan of the universe is one, and that,
   however harsh the expression may sound, the foresight and permission of
   sin were from the first included in it. An ultra-Calvinist would speak
   of the foreordination of sin; I take lower ground, and speak only of
   the foresight and permission of sin. Dealing with the question on the
   largest scale, I do not see how either Calvinist or Arminian can get
   away from this. It is not a question of how sin historically or
   empirically eventuated,--that we agree it must have done through human
   freedom,--but it is the question of fact, that sin is here, and that in
   the Divine plan it has been permitted to exist--that it has been taken
   up by God into His plan of the world. His plan included the permission
   of sin, and the treatment of it by Redemption. In a previous Lecture I
   referred to the view held by some, that nature, even before the Fall,
   had a prophetic reference to man's sin, and that in this way is to be
   explained much that is otherwise mysterious and perplexing in its
   arrangements. We have only to enlarge our range of vision to see that
   this way of looking at the subject applies to the whole plan of God. It
   is idle to speculate whether, had there been no sin, the plan of the
   universe would have included an Incarnation or not. Had this been
   different, everything else would have been different also. What we do
   know is, in that the infinite, possibilities of things, God has chosen
   to create a universe into which it was foreseen that sin would enter;
   and the Incarnation is a part of the plan of such a creation. This
   being so, it may very well be conceived that the Incarnation was the
   pivot on which everything else in this plan of creation was made to
   turn. To state my view in a sentence--God's plan is one; Christ was the
   Lamb slain from the foundation of the world; [680] and even creation
   itself is built up on Redemption lines.

   We must, I think, on this question allow great weight to the
   consideration of the revealed end. The Scriptures speak of an ultimate
   gathering together in one of all things in Christ--of a summing up of
   them in Him as Head. [681] It is then to be asked, Is this only the
   external unification of a universe not originally intended to be so
   unified, but in regard to which God's original plan was something
   entirely different? Or did it not lie in its original destination? The
   end of a thing, we are to remember, is that which in the Divine plan
   determines the beginning of it. What a thing is to be it is fitted for
   being by its original make. To turn it from that end, and superinduce
   another upon it, would be to some extent to contradict its true nature.
   If this is so in general, must it not be so in the highest degree when
   the end we speak of is the end of the universe, and the plan in
   question is that of gathering together in one all things in the
   Incarnate Son. If such a destination did not lie in the original plan
   of creation, was it in the nature of things possible that it could
   afterwards be externally superinduced upon it? Then what, in this view,
   becomes of the statement that all things were made for Christ, as well
   as by Him? [682] Can it be received at all, for such words go deeper
   than a mere economical adaptation? The longer these questions are
   pondered, the clearer will it appear that Christ's relation to the
   universe cannot be thought of as something adventitious and contingent;
   it is vital and organic. This means that His Incarnation had a relation
   to the whole plan of the world, and not simply to sin.

   Dr. Fairbairn himself really admits all that is here contended for,
   when he says, "The argument derived from the wonderful relationship,
   the personal and everlasting union into which humanity has been brought
   with the Godhead, as if the purpose concerning it should be turned into
   a kind of afterthought, and it should sink, in a manner derogatory to
   its high and unspeakably important nature, into something arbitrary and
   contingent, if placed in connection merely with the Fall;--such an
   argument derives all its plausibility from the limitations and defects
   inseparable from a human mode of contemplation. To the eye of Him who
   sees the end from the beginning,--whose purpose, embracing the whole
   compass of the providential plan, was formed before even the beginning
   was effected,--there could be nothing really contingent or uncertain in
   any part of the process." [683] That is to say, the Incarnation is not
   to be placed in connection merely with the Fall; but the plan even of
   creation had from the first a reference to an Incarnation for the sake
   of Redemption from sin, and the perfecting of humanity.

   When, from this point of view, we look back to the Scriptures, we find
   them in full harmony with the ideas now indicated.

   1. The Scriptures know of only one undivided purpose of God,--that
   eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus, and which embraces,
   apparently, both creation and Redemption. [684]

   2. We have the clearest acknowledgment, as has already been shown, of a
   direct relation of the Son to the work of creation. [685] It does not
   detract from the suggestiveness of the passages which declare this
   relation, but immensely adds to it, that, as Dr. Fairbairn says, the
   subject of the assertions is the historical Christ, He by whom
   believers have obtained Redemption, and in whom they have forgiveness
   of sins. For the drift of the passages is evidently to bring these two
   things more completely into line--the work of creation and the work of
   Redemption, and to show them to be parts of one Divine plan.

   3. Still more significant is the fact already insisted on, that, in
   some of the above passages, Christ is not only represented as the agent
   in creation, but as the final cause of creation. "All things have been
   created through Him, and unto Him." [686] He is the Alpha and Omega,
   the First and the Last. [687] Indirectly suggestive of the same idea
   are the passages which speak of "the kingdom prepared for (believers)
   from the foundation of the world"; [688] of "the Lamb slain from the
   foundation of the world"; [689] of Christ as "foreknown indeed before
   the foundation of the world," etc. [690]

   4. There are the express statements, also already quoted, of the goal
   to which God's purpose actually tends. I may here again avail myself of
   the words of Bishop Lightfoot, commenting on the phrase "unto Him."
   [691] "All things," he says, "must find their meeting-point, their
   reconciliation, at length in Him from whom they took their rise--in the
   Word as mediatorial agent, and through the Word in the Father as the
   primary source. . . . This ultimate goal of the present dispensation in
   time is similarly stated in several passages. Sometimes it is
   represented as the birth-throe and deliverance of all creation through
   Christ--as Rom. viii. 19, sq. Sometimes it is the absolute and final
   subjection of universal nature to Him--as 1 Cor. xv. 28. Sometimes it
   is the reconciliation of all things through Him--as below, ver. 20.
   Sometimes it is the recapitulation, the gathering up in one head, of
   the universe in Him--as Eph. i. 10. The image involved in this last
   passage best illustrates the particular expression in the text; but all
   alike enunciate the same truth in different terms. The Eternal Word is
   the goal of the universe, as He was the starting-point. It must end in
   unity, as it proceeded from unity; and the centre of this unity is
   Christ."

   The conclusion I reach is that this question, Would there have been an
   Incarnation but for sin? is one which rests upon a false abstraction.
   There is but one plan of God from the creation of the world, and it
   includes at once the permission of sin and the purpose of Redemption
   from it. It includes, therefore, the Incarnation as an integral and
   essential part of that purpose. The Incarnation has, indeed, immediate
   reference to Redemption; but it has at the same time a wider scope. It
   aims at carrying through the plan of creation, and conducts, not the
   redeemed portion of humanity alone, but the universe at large, to its
   goal. There is, however, another inference which we are entitled to
   draw--one which remarkably illustrates the unity of the Christian view.
   If we rightly interpret that view as implying that the Divine plan of
   the world contemplates an ultimate gathering up of all things into one
   in Christ, it will readily be seen that this, in turn, reflects back
   light on the doctrine of Christ's Person. It shows that we are right in
   ascribing to Him full and proper Divinity, not less than true humanity.
   For it is manifest that no other than a truly Divine Being is fitted to
   occupy this position which Scripture, with consentient voice, assigns
   to Christ. From the new height we have reached, light falls back also
   on Christ's place in the universe, in remarkable agreement with our
   previous postulates as to the nature of man, his place in. creation,
   and the law of ascent and development to which God's natural works so
   strikingly testify. As the inferior stages of existence are summed up
   in man, who stands at the head of the earthly creation, and forms a
   first link between the natural and the spiritual, so are all stages of
   humanity summed up in Christ, who in His Person as God-man links the
   creation absolutely with God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   God. That is the expression, alike simple and yet all-comprehending, of
   the Christian truth of faith."--Das Wesen, etc. p. 387. Most modern
   theologians, as Schleiermacher, Biedermann, Lipsius, Pfleiderer, etc.,
   express themselves similarly, though each has his own interpretation of
   the Trinitarian formula.

   [642] On Isa. xlviii. 16, Cheyne remarks: "I cannot but think with
   Kleinert (who, however, makes His Spirit' the subject) that we have
   both here and in Gen. i. 2 an early trace of what is known as the
   Christian doctrine of the Holy Spirit"; and on chap. xliii. 10: "There
   is an evident tendency in this book to hypostatise the Holy Spirit
   (which it mentions no less than seven times) with special distinctness.
   The author has already claimed to have been sent in special union with
   the Spirit of Jehovah; he now employs another phrase which could not
   have been used (cf. ver. 14) except of a person." Delitzsch confirms
   this view, remarking on chap. xlviii. 16: "Although His Spirit' is
   taken as a second object, the passage confirms what Cheyne and Driver
   agree in remarking, that in II. Isa. the tendency is evidently to
   regard the Spirit of God as a separate personality." Schultz remarks,
   in speaking of Creation:--" The Spirit of God and His Word appear as
   powers enclosed in God. The Spirit appears as very independent, in the
   manner of an hypostasis."--Alttest. Theol. p. 569. On the doctrine of
   the Spirit in the Old Testament, see Schultz, Oehler, and Kleinert in

   we are apt to think him--called to account for not using the terms
   Trinity' and Person' in his teachings on the Godhead, and having to
   defend himself for his preference for simple scriptural expressions.

   [650] Biedermann and Pfleiderer grant that, with the presupposition of
   the Personal Incarnation in Christ, the ontological Trinity is
   inevitable. "The Trinity," says Biedermann, "is the specific Christian
   concept of God, as it must necessarily develop itself out of the
   identification of the Divine principle in Christ with the Ego of Jesus
   Christ."--Dogmatik, ii. p. 600. Pfleiderer says: "When we observe that
   dogmatic reflection had to work with the presuppositions set up by the
   Pauline and Johannine theology, and with the notions provided in the
   philosophy of the age, we can scarcely imagine any other result to have
   been possible than that embodied in the decrees of the councils of
   Nicaea, Constantinople, and Chalcedon."--Religionsphilosophie, iii. p.
   218 (Eng. trans.).

   [651] "The anti-trinitarian movements of recent times have made it
   perfectly clear that there consequently only remains the choice either
   to think of God in a Unitarian manner, and in that case to see even in
   Jesus a mere man, or, if He is supposed to he the God-Man, to hold to
   eternal distinctions in God, and therefore to undertake to prove that
   the unity of God is quite consistent with such distinctions."--Dorner,
   System of Doctrine, i. p. 415 (Eng. trans.). But has Dr. Dorner himself
   a truly immanent Trinity? See Note A.--Recent Theories of the Trinity.

   [652] Bohme's "mode of imagining, of thinking," says Hegel, "is
   certainly somewhat fantastic and wild; he has not raised himself into
   the pure form of thought, but this is the ruling, the ground tendency
   of his ferment and struggle--to see the Trinity in everything and
   everywhere."--Religionsphilosophie, B. p. 246.

   [653] "No wonder," says Christlieb. "that philosophy too--and that not
   only the old mystic theosophical speculation, but also modern idealism,
   with all the acuteness of its dialectics--has taken up the idea of a
   Triune God, and endeavoured to comprehend and prove it. . . . Their
   efforts show us that modern philosophy (from Jacob Robins onwards)
   feels that this doctrine is the true solution of the world's enigma.
   Moreover, these philosophical investigations cast a strong light on the
   unconscionable superficiality and shortsightedness of those who most
   reject this fundamental doctrine of the Christian faith untested,
   without a notion of its deep religious, philosophical, and historical
   importance."--Moderne Zweifel, pp. 273, 274 (Eng. trans.). See Note
   A.--As above.

   [654] Augustine is constantly acknowledging the imperfection of finite
   analogies to express the ineffable reality of the Godhead. See
   specially Book xv. The following are some of the headings of chapters:
   "That it is not easy to discover the Trinity that is God from the
   trinities we have spoken of." "There is the greatest possible
   unlikeness between our word and knowledge and the Divine Word and
   knowledge." "Still further of the difference between the knowledge and
   word of our mind, and the knowledge and Word of God."--"How great is
   the unlikeness between our word and the Divine Word! Our word cannot
   be, or be called, eternal," etc. "We know but in an enigma," and "Who
   can explain how great is the unlikeness also, in this glass, in this
   enigma, in this likeness, such as it is?"--De Trinitate, p. 402 (Eng.
   trans.).

   [655] Thus, e.g., Weisse.

   [656] It is besides only progressively realised, and thus would involve
   a growing self-consciousness.

   [657] This objection is not obviated by assuming a world of finite
   personalities.

   [658] Heb. i. 3. Pfleiderer supposes that the Divine self-consciousness
   is mediated by God's own thoughts ("His changing activities and
   states")--but thoughts of what?--Religionsphilosophie, iii. p. 282
   (Eng. trans.).

   [659] Cf. on this argument Dorner, System of Doctrine, pp. 422-426;
   Christlieb,Moderne Zweifel, pp. 271, 272 (Eng. trans.), etc. Hegel
   makes it the startingpoint of his deduction. "Knowing implies that
   there is another which is known; and in the act of knowing, the other
   is appropriated. Herein it is contained that God, the eternally
   in-and-for-Himself existing One, eternally begets Himself as His Son,
   distinguishes Himself from Himself--the absolute act of
   judgment."--Religionsphilosophie, ii. p. 228.

   [660] It is developed specially by Sartorius in his Doctrine of Divine
   Love (translated). See also Martensen's Christian Ethics, i. p. 73;
   Christlieb's Moderne Zweifel, pp. 272, 273 (Eng. trans.); Laidlaw's
   Bible Doctrine of Man, pp. 126, 127; Murphy's Scientific Basis of
   Faith, p. 377; Lux Mundi, p.

   [661] 1 John iv. 16.

   [662] This is an important point in the doctrine of Divine Love. The
   thought is already met with in lrenaeus. Cf. Dorner, Person of Christ,
   i. p. 306. Martensen says: "God's love to the world is only then pure
   and unmixed holy affection when God, whilst He is sufficient to Himself
   and in need of nothing, out of infinite grace and mercy calls forth
   life and liberty beyond His own Being. . . . But this free power of
   love in the relations of God to the world presupposes the existence of
   perfect love realised within itself, the love of the Father and the Son
   in the unity of the Holy Spirit."--Christian Ethics, i. p. 74.
   Similarly Dorner in his Christian Ethics, p. 94 (Eng. trans.).

   [663] This is the mistake of those who, in a Sabellian way, take Father
   as the name for God as the Creator, etc. The Christian idea of the
   Father comes to birth only in the Revelation of the Son. The terms are
   reciprocal. See Note A.

   [664] Theological Essays, 3rd ed. p. 257.

   [665] This important aspect of the Trinity, as safeguarding the true
   idea of God in. relation to the world (His immanence and transcendence)
   against the opposite errors of Deism and Pantheism, is brought out with
   special fulness by Dorner in his discussion of Sabellianism and
   Arianism, Person of Christ, i. and B., and his System of Doctrine, i.
   pp. 365-378. Cf. also Martensen's Dogmatics, pp. 103-106; Christlieb's
   Moderne Zweifel, pp. 263-265; Lux Mundi, pp. 92-102, etc.

   [666] A remarkable illustration of how the deeper thought on God runs
   almost necessarily into a Trinitarian mould is furnished by an essay of
   Dr. Martineau's on "A Way out of the Trinitarian Controversy," in his
   recently published volume of Essays, Ecclesiastical and Historical. See

LECTURE VIII.

  THE INCARNATION AND REDEMPTION FROM SIN.

    Introductory

   Whatever we may think of the Incarnation in its wider relations to the
   plan of the world and the ends of creation as a whole, it remains the
   fact that in Scripture it is always brought into immediate connection
   with sin, and with the purpose of God in Redemption. "He was manifested
   to take away sins," says John, "and in Him was no sin"; [692] and so
   say all the writers in the New Testament. Christianity is thus
   distinctively a religion of Redemption,--a great Divine economy fore
   the recovery of men from the guilt and power of sin--from a state of
   estrangement and hostility to God--to a state of holiness and
   blessedness in the favour of God, and of fitness for the attainment of
   their true destination. It is in this light we are to consider it in
   the present Lecture.

   We may, therefore, set aside at once as alien to the true Christian
   view, or at least as inadequate and defective, all such representations
   of Christianity as see in its Founder only a great religious teacher
   and preacher of righteousness; or a great religious and social
   reformer, such as has often appeared in the history of the world; or a
   great philanthropist, caring for the bodies and souls of men; or one
   whose main business it was to inoculate men with a new "enthusiasm for
   humanity"; [693] or a teacher with a new ethical secret to impart to
   mankind; or even such representations as see m Him only a new spiritual
   Head of humanity, whose work it is to complete the old creation, and
   lift the race to a higher platform of spiritual attainment, or help it
   a stage further onwards to the goal of its perfection. Christ is all
   this, but He is infinitely more. God's end in His creation indeed
   stands, as also His purpose to realise it; but, under the) conditions
   in which humanity exists, that end can only be realised through a
   Redemption, and it is this Redemption which Christ pre-eminently came
   into the world to affect.

   A comparison has sometimes been instituted in this respect between
   Christianity and Buddhism, which also is in some sort a religion of
   Redemption. But the comparison only brings out the more conspicuously
   the unique and original character of the Christian system. For whereas
   Buddhism starts from the conception of the inherent evil and misery of
   existence, and Redemption which it promises as the result of
   indefinitely prolonged striving through many successive lives is the
   eternal rest and peace of non-being; the Christian view, on the other
   hand, starts from the conception that everything in its original nature
   and in the intent of its Creator is good, and that the evil of the
   world is the result of wrong and perverted development,--holds,
   therefore, that Redemption from it is possible by the use of
   appropriate means. And Redemption here includes, not merely deliverance
   from existing evils, but restoration of the Divine likeness which has
   been lost by man, and the ultimate blessedness of the life everlasting.
   [694]

   The chief point on which the discussion in this subject turns is the
   connection of Redemption with the Person and work of Christ. Here at
   the outset it is necessary to guard against too narrow an idea of
   Redemption, as if the saving work of Christ were limited to that doing
   and suffering which we call the Atonement. The ends of Christ's coming
   into the world include much more than the making atonement for sin.
   This is recognised when the Church names three offices which Christ
   executes as our Redeemer--a prophetic and a kingly as well as a
   priestly office. Yet it is principally on the question of Atonement, or
   the manner of the connection of Redemption with the doing and suffering
   of Christ, that discussion has been directed, and it is to this subject
   I shall specially address myself. [695]

   I. It needs no proof that all the New Testament writers who refer to
   the subject regard the forgiveness of sins and the salvation of men as
   connected in quite a peculiar way with the death of Christ; and it is
   not less evident that they do this because they ascribe to Christ's
   death a sacrificial and expiatory value. They do this further, as every
   one must feel, not in a mere poetic and figurative way, but with the
   most intense conviction that they have really been redeemed and
   reconciled to God by the death of Christ upon the cross. The how of
   this redemptive transaction most of them may not enter into, but Paul,
   at least, has a theology on this subject, with the main outlines of
   which the others, judging from the expressions they use, and the
   propitiatory virtue they ascribe to the shedding of Christ's blood,
   must be held to agree. [696] Happily we are freed from the necessity of
   dwelling long on the apostolic testimony on this subject, for the same
   reason which I gave when speaking of the Person of Christ--namely, that
   impartial exegesis and Biblical theology practically grant to us all
   that we assert. Apart from such occasional speculations as, e.g.,
   Holsten's, that, in Paul's view, sin is identical with the body or
   "flesh" of Christ, and that the slaying of Christ's body or flesh
   denotes the slaying of sin, [697] it will be found that the
   descriptions given of the teaching of the Epistles as to the work of
   Redemption do not differ much from those met with in our ordinary books
   of theology. The accounts given us, e.g., by Baur or Reuss or
   Pfleiderer, or even by Martineau [698] --not to speak of an exegete
   like Meyer, or a Biblical theologian like Weiss--of the doctrine of
   Paul on Redemption, is what, with very slight exception, any of us
   could accept. The same is true of the other New Testament witnesses--of
   the Epistle to the Hebrews, of Peter, of Revelation, of the Epistles of
   John. With differences of standpoint and strong individual
   characteristics, it is acknowledged that they teach a fundamentally
   identical doctrine of Redemption from the guilt and power of sin
   through Christ, and particularly that they ascribe to His death a
   sacrificial or propitiatory virtue. To get rid of the attribution of
   this view to the author of the Fourth Gospel, Dr. Martineau has to
   assume, in face of all probability and evidence, that the First Epistle
   of John is not by the same author as the Gospel. [699]

   More important is the question which the newer forms of controversy
   press upon us--Whether Christ's doctrine on this subject is the same as
   that of His apostles? We have a theology of propitiation in the
   Epistles--that is admitted; but have we anything of the same kind in
   Christ's own words? Was not the gospel preached in Galilee a much
   simpler thing than the theological gospel preached by Paul, or
   contained in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and is it not free from every
   trace of this cumbrous machinery of Atonement, or of pardon on the
   ground of the suffering and death of another? Where, it is asked, is
   there any vestige of this doctrine in the Sermon on the Mount, or in
   the parable of the Prodigal Son? Is this doctrine not an aftergrowth,
   the result of the running of the Divine thoughts of the Master, and of
   the impression produced by His life and death, into the moulds of
   Jewish sacrificial conceptions which had no real affinity with them,
   and have indeed served to overlay and obscure them to the apprehension
   of all subsequent generations?

   If the case were as this objection represents it, I grant that it would
   have very serious consequences for our faith. If the apostles of
   Christ--the very persons chosen by Him to communicate His doctrine to
   the world, and to whom He promised the illumination, of His Spirit for
   this very end--could so seriously misunderstand and pervert His
   doctrine on this essential point, I do not know what credit we should
   be able to attach to them on any point on which they profess to
   represent the mind of Christ. Dr. Dale has argued this point so
   strongly in his book on the Atonement, [700] that I do not need to do
   more than refer to it. It is not for us, it is for the objector to
   explain how the guides and leaders of the apostolic Church should come
   with this singular unanimity to shift the centre of gravity in Christ's
   gospel from where He Himself had placed it, and so to mislead the world
   as to the essentials of their Master's teaching. But the question
   remains--Have they done so? And this is certainly not proved from the
   circumstance that, in Christ's own teaching, the doctrine of Atonement
   is not brought forward with the same explicitness as it is in the
   apostolic writings. That Christ took up a central position in relation
   to the truths which He proclaimed, that he invited men to faith in
   Himself as the condition of their participation in the blessings of the
   kingdom, that He promised the fullest satisfaction in the approaching
   kingdom to the hunger and thirst of the spiritually needy, that He
   declared that it was by their relation to Him that men would be
   ultimately judged,--this lies upon the surface of the Gospels. But that
   He should have preached to the Galilean multitudes truths which, on any
   hypothesis, could only be intelligible after His death and resurrection
   had taken place,--that He should have done this before He had even
   publicly proclaimed Himself to be the Messiah,--this is to ask what in
   reason we are not entitled to expect. Before there could be any
   preaching of an Atonement, there must be an Atonement to preach. I
   grant, however, that if the apostolic gospel really represents the
   truth about Christ's work, the facts of His early manifestation ought
   to bear this out. They must be such, at least, that the apostolic
   gospel is felt to be the natural key to them. In reality they are much
   more; for, taken in their entirety, they point unmistakably to just
   such a view as the apostolic doctrine gives, and explain to us, what
   else would be a complete enigma, how such a doctrine could arise.

   It is significant that the most unbiased modern inquiry into Christ's
   teaching recognises that He attributed a redemptive virtue to His
   death, and connected it directly with the forgiveness of sins. [701]
   Ritschl also acknowledges that Christ first, and after Him the oldest
   witnesses, connect Redemption or forgiveness, not with His prophetic
   office, but much more with the fact of His death. [702] Taking the
   testimony of the Gospels as a whole, I think it is exceedingly strong.
   It is remarkable that in the Gospel of John, the most spiritual of the
   four, we have both the earliest and the clearest statements of the fact
   that Christ's death stood in direct relation to the salvation of the
   world. I refer to such passages as the Baptist's utterance, "Behold the
   Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"; [703] Christ's
   words to Nicodemus, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
   even so must the Son of Man be lifted up," [704] etc.; and the sayings
   in chap. vi. about giving His flesh for the life of the world. [705] In
   the Synoptic Gospels, while in one saying at least of the earlier
   ministry there is a premonition of the cross, [706] it was not till
   after Peter's great confession that Jesus began to speak explicitly to
   the disciples of His approaching sufferings and death. [707] Then we
   have many utterances declaring the necessity of His death, and such a
   saying throwing light upon its character as, "For verily the Son of Man
   came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a
   ransom for many." [708] On the Mount of Transfiguration it was the
   decease which He should accomplish at Jerusalem which was the subject
   of discourse. [709] But the clearest expression of all prior to His
   death is His solemn utterance at the institution of the Supper, when,
   taking the sacramental bread and wine, He said, "This is My body; this
   is My blood of the Covenant, which is shed for many, unto remission of
   sins." [710] To this must be added the instruction which the disciples
   are recorded to have received after the resurrection. On one remarkable
   occasion we read that Christ said to them "O foolish men, and slow of
   heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Behoved it not
   the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into His glory? And
   beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He interpreted to them
   in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself." [711] And at a
   later meeting with the eleven, "These are My words which I spake unto
   you, while I was yet with you, how that all things must needs be
   fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and
   the psalms concerning Me. Then opened He their mind, that they might
   understand the scriptures; and He said unto them, Thus it is written,
   that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead on the
   third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
   in His name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem." [712]
   These passages are invaluable as giving us a clue to the clearness and
   decision of the subsequent apostolic doctrine. What these lengthened
   interpretations of Jesus included we cannot of course tell, but they
   must have embraced much light on the significance of His death; and for
   the nature of that light we are entitled to look to the Spirit-guided
   utterances of the apostles who received it.

   The apostolic Church, therefore, was not left without guidance in its
   construction of the doctrine of Redemption, any more than in its
   construction of the doctrine of Christ's Person. It had various groups
   of facts to lead it to a conclusion.

   1. It had the objective facts themselves of Christ's death,
   resurrection, and subsequent exaltation to heaven. Holding fast as it
   did to the Messiahship and Divine Sonship of Jesus, it could not but
   find the death of Christ a dark and perplexing problem, till it grasped
   the solution in the thought of a Divine necessity for that death for
   the accomplishment of the Messianic salvation. With this had to be
   taken the fact of Christ's own command, that repentance and remission
   of sins should be preached in His name to all nations. Behind this
   again were all the facts of. His earthly life, with its revelations of
   Messianic power and grace, and its not less wonderful self-abasement
   and sorrow.

   2. There were the sayings of Christ, above referred to, which threw
   light upon the meaning and necessity of His sufferings and death.
   These, in the new illumination of the Spirit, would be earnestly
   pondered, and are sufficient to explain all the forms in which Christ's
   death came to be regarded by them.

   3. There was an earlier Revelation with which the new economy stood in
   the closest relations, and to which Christ Himself had directed His
   disciples for instruction regarding Himself. In many ways also this old
   covenant aided them to a fuller comprehension of the meaning of the
   sufferings and death of Christ.

   (1) There were the prophecies of the Old Testament,--foremost among
   them that wonderful prophecy of the Servant of Jehovah in Isaiah liii.,
   to whose undeserved sufferings, lovingly and submissively borne, an
   expiatory virtue is expressly ascribed. "There is no exegete," says
   Professor G. A. Smith, "but agrees to this: . . . all agree to the fact
   that by Himself, or by God, the Servant's life is offered an expiation
   for sin--a satisfaction to the law of God." [713]

   (2) There was the work of the law in men's hearts, begetting in them
   the sense of sin, and, in virtue of its propaedeutic character,
   creating the deep feeling of the need of Redemption. It is with this
   consciousness of the want of righteousness wrought by the law, and the
   consequent feeling of the need of Redemption, that Paul's doctrine
   specially connects itself.

   (3) There was the sacrificial system of the Old Testament. This was the
   remaining key in the hands of the early Church to unlock the
   significance of Christ's death. If the law created the sense of sin, it
   was the sacrificial system which created the idea of Atonement. This,
   in turn, is the thought to which the Epistle to the Hebrews specially
   attaches itself. When, therefore, exception is taken to the apostles
   casting their ideas into the moulds of Jewish sacrificial conceptions,
   we have rather to ask whether the economy of sacrifice was not Divinely
   prepared for this very end, that it might foreshadow the one and true
   Sacrifice by which the sin of the world is taken away, and whether this
   is not in accordance with all the data at our disposal.

   II. Assuming, however, that all this is granted,--that it is conceded
   that the apostles teach Redemption through the death of Christ, and
   that there is no, discrepancy in this respect between their teaching
   and that of Christ Himself,--we are still far from a solution of the
   many questions which may be raised in regard to this great cardinal
   doctrine. Indeed, our real task is only commencing. Those who think
   that, on the basis of Scripture passages, a ready-made theory of
   Atonement lies to our hand, have only to consider the show and gradual
   process by which the doctrine of the Church has been built up to its
   present form, to become convinced of the contrary. Christ's death is a
   sacrifice, but in what sense is it a sacrifice? It is a propitiation
   for our sins; but what are the elements in it which give it value as a
   propitiation? It is connected with the remission of sins; but what is
   the nature of this connection? These are questions as keenly discussed
   to-day as ever, and we cannot avoid considering them in connection with
   the deep and difficult problems which they raise.

   Now I for one do not think it is the duty of the Church to rest
   content--as some express it--with the fact of the Atonement, without
   further inquiring as deeply as we can into its nature. I cannot believe
   that any doctrine of Scripture--least of all the doctrine of Atonement,
   which is represented in Scripture as the Revelation of the innermost
   heart of God to man, the central and supreme manifestation of His love
   to the world--was ever meant to lie like a dead-weight on our
   understanding, incapable of being in any degree assimilated by our
   thought. Certain it is that any doctrine which is treated in this way
   will not long retain its hold on men's convictions, but will sooner or
   later be swept out of the way as a piece of useless theological lumber.
   The Atonement, as Dr. John M'Leod Campbell was fond of putting it, must
   be capable of being seen in its own light. I grant, indeed, that the
   fact of the Atonement is greater than all our apprehensions of it. We
   are here in the very Holy of holies of the Christian faith, and our
   treatment of the subject cannot be too reverential. The one thing a
   priori certain about the Atonement is, that it has heights and depths,
   lengths and breadths, greater than any line of ours can fathom or span.
   It is this which should make us patient of what are called theories of
   the Atonement. I do not know any one of these theories of which it can
   justly be said that it is unmixed error,--which has not rather in the
   heart of it a portion of the truth,--which does not apprehend some side
   or aspect of the Atonement which other theories neglect, or have thrust
   into the background. Instead, therefore, of being too keen to scent
   error in these theories, our wiser plan will be to be ever on the
   outlook for an enlargement of our knowledge of the truth through them.

   If I might indicate in a word what I take to be the tendency of the
   modern treatment of the Atonement, I would say that it consists in the
   endeavour to give a spiritual interpretation to the great fact which
   lies at the heart of our Redemption; not necessarily to deny its
   judicial aspect,--for that, I take it, will be found impossible,--but
   to remove from it the hard, legal aspect it is apt to assume when
   treated as a purely external fact, without regard to its inner
   spiritual content; and, further, to bring it into harmony with the
   spiritual laws and analogies which obtain in other spheres. There is
   the attempt (1) to find spiritual laws which will make the Atonement
   itself intelligible; and (2) to find spiritual laws which connect the
   Atonement with the new life which springs from it. I may add that this
   is a department of the truth in which I think that the theology of our
   own country has rendered better service to the Christian view than the
   theology of the Continent.

   In accordance with my plan, I am led to study this subject of Atonement
   through Christ especially from the point of view of the Incarnation.
   There is an advantage in this method, for as, on the one hand, we see
   how the Atonement rises naturally out of the Incarnation, so that the
   Son of God could not appear in our nature without undertaking such a
   work as this term denotes; so, on the other, we see that the
   Incarnation is itself a pledge and anticipation of reconciliation. It
   is evident that such an event could never have taken place had there
   been no purpose or possibility of salvation; had humanity been a
   hopelessly ruined and rejected race. In principle, therefore, the
   Incarnation is the declaration of a purpose to save the world. It is
   more: it is itself a certain stage in that reconciliation, and the
   point of departure for every other. In the Incarnation, God and, man
   are already in a sense one, In Christ a pure point of union is
   established with our fallen and sin-laden humanity, and this carries
   with it the assurance that everything else that is necessary for the
   complete recovery of the world to God will not be lacking. Theories,
   therefore, have never been wanting in the Church which, in one form or
   another, lay the stress in Redemption on the simple fact of the
   Incarnation. As Dr. Hodge has expressed it, "The Incarnation itself,
   the union of the Divine and human natures, was the great saving act.
   Christ redeems us by what He is, not by what He does." [714] Germs of
   such theories appear in some of the early Church fathers, e.g. in
   Irenaeus. [715] They reappeared in the Middle Ages, and at the
   Reformation. [716] They have a modern analogue in the theories of the
   Hegelian school, which in the realised unity of God and humanity in
   Christ see the prototype of that unity of God and man which is to be
   accomplished in the race in general. The thought of the identity of
   Incarnation and Redemption colours modern theology in many other ways.
   [717] These theories are obviously defective, if meant to exhaust the
   whole Scripture doctrine on the subject; but they have their point of
   truth in this, that the perfect union of the Word with humanity is
   already a reconciliation of the race with God in principle, and is,
   besides, the medium by which a new Divine life is introduced into
   humanity--a view with which the theology of John specially connects
   itself.

   In further considering the theories on this subject, it will be
   convenient to observe that all theories of Redemption within Christian
   limits agree in taking for granted three things as included under this
   term--

   1. There is the removal of guilt, or of the consciousness of guilt,
   which carries with it the sense of the Divine forgiveness.

   2. There is the breaking down of the actual enmity of the heart and
   will to God, and the turning of the sinner from dead works to serve the
   hiving and true God.

   3. There is the taking up of the believer into the positive fellowship
   of eternal life with Christ, and into the consciousness of a Divine
   Sonship.

   These are the immediate effects, from which others follow in a changed
   relation to the world, gradual progress in holiness, and deliverance at
   death and in eternity from all natural and spiritual evils.

   Accordingly now as theories relate themselves predominantly to one or
   other of these points of view, they present a different aspect.

   1. Theories which attach themselves by preference to the last point of
   view--that of fellowship--are apt to regard Christ chiefly as the type
   of the normal relation of God to humanity, and to subordinate the other
   aspects of His life and work to this.

   2. Theories which attach themselves to the second point of view--the
   breaking down of the sinner's enmity--regard Christ's work as a great
   moral dynamic--"the power of God unto salvation," [718] the effect of
   which is to break down the natural distrust of the heart towards God,
   and to melt the sinner into penitence,--"to bring men," as Bushnell
   expresses it, "out & their sins, and so out of their penalties." [719]

   3. Theories which attach themselves to the first point of view--the
   removal of guilt--lay special stress on the relation of Christ's work
   to the Divine righteousness, and view it specially as an expiation.

   A perfect theory, if we could obtain it, would be one which did justice
   to all these standpoints, and presented them in their scriptural
   relations to each other and to the Person and work, of the Redeemer.

   Without adhering rigidly to the scheme here indicated, which would be
   indeed impossible, seeing that the different theories cross each other
   at innumerable points, I shall now glance at the chief standpoints
   represented in these theories, and try to show that they gradually lead
   us up to a view which embraces them all; and is in harmony with the
   full Scripture testimony.

   1. We have a class of theories which start from the idea of fellowship,
   based on the unique relation which Christ sustains to the race as
   perfect, archetypal Man--a relation expressed in the title--"Son of
   Man." The point on which stress is laid here is the solidarity between
   Christ and the race which He came to save, a true thought in itself,
   and one which takes the place in modern theology of the older way of
   looking at Christ's relation to the race as purely federal or official.
   The typical example of this class of theories is Schleiermacher's. With
   the idea of fellowship Schleiermacher combines that of representation.
   The essence of Redemption, in his view, consists in deliverance from
   the miserable contradiction of flesh and spirit, through being taken up
   into the fellowship of Christ's life of holiness and blessedness. [720]
   As standing in this fellowship with Christ, believers are the objects
   of the love of God, who looks upon them in Him. "Christ," he says,
   "purely represents us before God in virtue of His own perfect
   fulfilment of the Divine will, to which, through His life in us, the
   impulse is active in us also, so that in this connection with Him we
   also are objects of the Divine good pleasure." [721] In thus speaking
   of Christ in His sinless perfection as representing believers before
   God, it might appear as if Schleiermacher held a doctrine of
   imputation,--indeed, he says this is the true meaning of that much
   misunderstood phrase, the imputation of the righteousness of Christ.
   [722] When, however, we probe the matter a little further, his meaning
   is found to be nothing more than this--that God already sees in the
   initial stage of the believer's holiness the germ of his subsequent
   full perfection,--of that perfection of which Christ is the pattern or
   type,--and views him in the light of that ideal. [723] This thought of
   a justification through germinal holiness is a favourite one with
   writers of a mystical and speculative tendency; but it manifestly
   shifts the ground of acceptance from Christ for us to Christ in us, and
   treats objective reconciliation as unnecessary. [724] In
   Schleiermacher's theory, accordingly, as in those of a kindred type,
   Christ's sufferings and death have only a very subordinate place. These
   sufferings arose from His being in a world where evils are a necessary
   result of sin, and from His fellow-feeling for us in our sins.

   They may therefore be called substitutionary, as endured by a sinless
   Being for the sake of others, but they are in no sense satisfactory or
   expiatory. They are connected with our Redemption as teaching us to
   feel that outward evils are not necessarily penal, but chiefly through
   the Revelation they give us of Christ's constancy and love, and through
   the moral impression they are fitted to make upon us. [725]
   Schleiermacher's theory in the end thus passes over into one of moral
   influence; indeed, it is through the powerful working of Christ's
   Personality upon us that we are moved to enter into fellowship with Him
   at all. He is our Redeemer through the exceptional strength of His
   God-consciousness, by which our own is invigorated to overcome sin. If,
   then, we ask how, on this theory, the sense of guilt is removed, the
   answer we get is very curious. In fellowship with Christ,
   Schleiermacher says, the believer is a new man, and in the new man sin
   is no longer active. Sin in the believer is but the after-working and
   back-working of the old man, and as such the believer does not identify
   himself with it. [726] He is relieved, therefore, from the
   consciousness of guilt. Something like this is Kant's theory, [727] and
   in our own days it is the theory of a section of the Plymouth
   Brethren--so do extremes meek But it is evident that, on this
   hypothesis, the doctrine of forgiveness is retained only in name. The
   old man is not forgiven, and the new man does not need forgiveness.
   Between the two forgiveness falls to the ground. [728]

   2. Schleiermacher, in his treatment of Christ's sufferings, lays
   special stress on His sympathy or fellow-feeling with us, as a cause of
   these sufferings. This gives us a point of transition to a second class
   of theories, the keynote of which may be said to be sympathy. The
   starting-point here is not the thought of Christ's archetypal
   perfection, but the fitness of Christianity in a dynamical relation to
   break down the enmity of the sinner's heart to God. The best-known type
   of this class of theory is Dr. Bushnell's, in his original and freshest
   presentation of it in his work on Vicarious Sacrifice. The strong and
   true point in Dr. Bushnell's theory is in its insistence on the
   vicarious element involved in the very nature of sympathetic love. We
   speak of Christ's substitutionary work, [729] --of His standing,
   suffering, dying for sinners,--but how often do we apprehend this in a
   purely external and official way! It is the merit of Dr. Bushnell's
   book that, with a wealth of illustration drawn from every sphere of
   life in which a like law of substitution prevails, he makes us feel
   that it is something real and vital. When we speak of sympathy, we are
   already in a region in which substitutionary forces are at work. "None
   of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself." [730] We benefit
   and suffer involuntarily through each other, but we have it also in our
   power to enter voluntarily into the partnership of the world's joys and
   sorrows, and by bearing the burdens of others to help to relieve them
   of their load. From His unique relation to our race, this law applied
   in the highest degree to Christ. In the whole domain of love, Divine
   and human, we find substitutionary forces acting; but in Christ's life
   we find them acting at a maximum. Christ not only wears our nature, but
   in the exercise of a perfect sympathy He truly identifies Himself with
   us in our lot, bears our sins and sorrows on His soul, and represents
   us to the Father, not as an external legal surety, but with a throbbing
   heart of love. This of itself may not be Atonement--we shall see
   immediately it is not--but whatever else there is in Atonement,
   Scripture warrants us in saying that at least there is this. "Himself
   took our infirmities, and bare our diseases," says Matthew, [731] in a
   passage which Dr. Bushnell adopts as the key to his theory. "It behoved
   Him in all things to be made like unto His brethren,. that He might be
   a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to
   make propitiation for the sins of the people." [732]

   This, then, is the key which Dr. Bushnell gives us to the vicarious
   sufferings of Christ--that of sympathetic love; and so far as the book
   in question goes, it is the whole key. If I were disposed to criticise
   the theory minutely, I might remark that, on Dr. Bushnell's own
   principles, it is too narrow to cover all the facts. To get an adequate
   explanation of Christ's undeserved sufferings, alike as regards their
   nature, their motive, and their end, we need a wider view of them than
   is covered by this single word--sympathy. Sympathy, in a pure and holy
   nature like Christ's, was necessarily one cause of His sufferings, but
   it was not the only cause. He suffered from natural causes--as hunger
   and thirst, from the unbelief of the world, from the persecutions and
   malice of His enemies, from temptations of the devil, from the
   faithlessness and desertion of disciples, etc. Deeper and more
   mysterious causes of suffering are not obscurely intimated in the
   Gospel narratives. Sympathy was only indirectly concerned with all
   these. If it be said that it was the sympathetic entrance into and
   endurance of these sufferings which gave them their vicarious
   character, I would remark that we need here a wider word than sympathy.
   Christ voluntarily took upon Him abasement, suffering, and death for
   the salvation of men; but He did so, not simply from sympathy; but--as
   Dr. Bushnell also often recognises, though still generally emphasising
   the sympathetic aspect--in a spirit of large, self-sacrificing love.
   Love includes sympathy, but is not necessarily exhausted by it. We take
   also too narrow a view when we seek in the moral influence of sympathy
   or love the sole key to the peculiar fruitfulness of self-sacrifice.
   That self-sacrifice acts as a potent inspiration to like deeds in
   others--that it has power to soften and subdue the obdurate heart--is a
   great truth. But it should not be overlooked that a main part of the
   secret of the fruitfulness of self-sacrifice lies in the way in which
   one life is linked with another, and society is bound together as a
   whole; so that, through the labours and sacrifices of one, or of a
   handful, martyrs or patriots, benefits accrue to multitudes who never
   come within the range of its moral influence. [733]

   This leads directly to another remark--namely, that Dr. Bushnell does
   not give any clear answer to the question, What was the distinctive
   life-task, or vocation, in the fulfilment of which these great and
   heavy sorrows came upon Christ? This is a point of very great
   importance. Sympathy, or disinterested love, will lead one person to
   undertake labours and undergo sacrifices for another, but the sacrifice
   is undergone, not for the mere sake of displaying sympathy, but always
   in the prosecution of some independent end. The mother wears out her
   strength for her sick child, but it is in the hope that by her nursing
   she will aid in its recovery. The philanthropist will devote life and
   fortune for the cause in which he is interested, but it is in carrying
   out plans and projects which he thinks will contribute to the success
   of his object. If we ask, then, What was the work which Christ came
   into the world to do, in the accomplishment of which He endured such
   sufferings? it will not do to reply simply, To manifest sympathy, for
   the sake of the moral impression to be produced by it. We must still
   ask, What was the work which made submission to this suffering
   necessary? To this question Dr. Bushnell gives us no very definite
   answer, none which carries us beyond Christ's immediate ministries to
   soul and body, or His witness-bearing in word or deed for the Father.
   But even this must have for its content some special declaration of
   God's character and will, if it is not simply to point us back to the
   exhibition of love in the vicarious suffering. It is on the latter
   really that Dr. Bushnell lays all the stress; the suffering, in his
   view, is not simply a necessary incident in the prosecution of some
   independent task of love, but is the main, substantial reason of
   Christ's appearance in the world. [734] If, on the other hand, we lay
   the chief weight on the witness of Christ, and view His sufferings in
   subordination to this as furnishing occasions for the manifestation of
   His patience, steadfastness, and love to men--then is His work purely
   declarative, His sufferings add nothing to its content, and owe their
   value for redemptive purposes solely to their power of moral
   enforcement.

   It is obvious that, if Dr. Bushnell's theory be true, vicarious
   suffering which has redemptive efficacy, is not confined to Christ, but
   runs through the whole spiritual universe. This, indeed, is what he
   asserts. [735] It points, however, to a clear defect in his view,
   inasmuch as it removes the work of Christ from that unique and
   exceptional position which the Scriptures constantly ascribe to it.
   Even were this difficulty surmounted, there remains the crowning
   objection, which is the really fatal one--namely, that in resolving the
   redeeming efficacy of the sufferings of Christ solely into their moral
   influence, the theory runs directly counter to the explicit and uniform
   declarations of the New Testament, which put in the foreground their
   expiatory and propitiatory character. It is the less necessary to ask
   whether Dr. Bushnell's theory in this respect is adequate, since he
   himself at a subsequent period was compelled to modify it in favour of
   the recognition of an objective element in the Atonement. In his later
   work on Forgiveness and Law, he tells us that he had formerly conceived
   the whole import and effect of Christ's work to lie in its reconciling
   power on others; now he has been brought to see that it has a
   propitiatory effect on God also. The peculiar view which underlies this
   second work--namely, that God must overcome His repugnance to the
   sinner by making cost or sacrifice for him, need not detain us here,
   especially as I do not know of anyone who has ever adopted it. [736]
   But I cannot refrain from adverting, as most of Dr. Bushnell's critics
   have done, to the striking evidence which even the earlier volume
   affords of the necessity of recognising an objective propitiation.
   There is, perhaps, nothing more curious in literature than the way in
   which, in the closing chapter of his Vicarious Sacrifice, after
   exhausting all his powers to convince us that the efficacy of Christ's
   sufferings lies solely in their moral efficacy, Dr. Bushnell
   practically throws the whole theory he has been inculcating to the
   winds as inadequate for the moral and spiritual needs of men. "In the
   facts of our Lord's passion," he says, "outwardly regarded, there is no
   sacrifice, or oblation, or atonement, or propitiation, but simply a
   living and dying thus and thus. . . . If, then, the question arises,
   How are we to use such a history so as to be reconciled by it? we
   hardly know in what way to begin. How shall we come to God by the help
   of this martyrdom? How shall we turn it, or turn ourselves under it, so
   as to be justified and set in peace with God? Plainly there is a want
   here, and this want is met by giving a thought-form to the facts which
   is not in the facts themselves. They are put directly into the moulds
   of the altar, and we are called to accept the crucified God-Man as our
   sacrifice, an offering or oblation for us, our propitiation, so as to
   be sprinkled from our evil conscience--washed, purged, and cleansed
   from our sin. . . . So much is there in this, that without these forms
   of the altar we should be utterly at a loss in making any use of the
   Christian facts that would set us in a condition of practical
   reconciliation with God. Christ is good, beautiful, wonderful; His
   disinterested hove is a picture by itself; His forgiving patience melts
   into my feeling; His passion rends my heart. But what is He for? And
   how shall He be made to me the salvation that I want? One word--He is
   my sacrifice--opens all to me; and beholding Him, with all my sin upon
   Him, I count Him my offering; I come unto God by Him, and enter into
   the holiest by His blood." [737] Not a word needs to be added to this
   self-drawn picture by Dr. Bushnell of the inadequacy of a mere moral
   influence theory of the Atonement. If the soul, in order to find peace
   with God, must explicitly renounce that theory, how can it be put
   forward as in any sense a theory of reconciliation? It fails to satisfy
   the wants of the awakened conscience; and it fails to satisfy
   Scripture, which, as we have seen, demands an objective connection
   between Christ's work and our forgiveness.

   3. Before dealing with theories which recognise an objective element in
   the Atonement, it may be useful to glance at a theory which really
   belongs to the subjective class, though its author has done his best to
   give it an objective form--I mean the theory of Ritschl As Bushnell's
   theory turns on . the idea of sympathy, so that of Ritschl may be said
   to turn on the idea of Vocation. Ritschl's strong point lies precisely
   in the answer which he gives to the question which Bushnell failed to
   meet--namely, What was the work which Christ came into the world to do,
   which entailed on Him suffering and rejection? What was His vocation,
   His life-work, His peculiar moral task? It is this thought of Christ's
   fulfilment of His vocation (Beruf) which is the central thing in
   Ritschl. He speaks of the solidaric unity of Christ with God. [738] By
   this he means that Christ adopted God's end in the creation and
   government of the world (Weltzweck) as His own end, and lived and died
   to fulfil it. This end is summed up in the establishing of the kingdom
   of God--that is, of a religious and moral community, in which the
   members are bound together by hove to God and love to man, and act
   solely from the motive of hove; and in which they attain the end aimed
   at in all religions, namely, moral supremacy over the world, which is
   Ritschl's synonym for eternal life. [739] This, it will be allowed, is
   a somewhat bald scheme, and it does not become richer as we proceed. In
   what sense, we ask, is Christ a Redeemer? The essential part of the
   answer seems to be that through His Revelation of God's grace and
   truth, through His preaching of the kingdom of God, and through His
   personal devotion to God's world-aim, He influences and enables men to
   turn from their sins, and leads them to appropriate God's end as their
   own. The uniqueness of Christ's Person is supposed to be secured by the
   fact that in Him first the final end of the kingdom of God is realised
   in a personal life, so that everyone who would undertake the same
   life-task must do it in dependence on Him. [740] Ritschl, therefore, is
   able, like Schleiermacher, to speak of Christ as the "Urbild" of
   humanity in its relation to the kingdom of God, and as such the
   original object of the love of God, in whom God beholds and loves those
   who are embraced in His fellowship. [741] But fellowship here means
   simply unity of moral aim. What significance, on this theory, have the
   sufferings of Christ? Only this significance, that they are the highest
   proof of Christ's fidelity in His vocation--the guarantee of the
   reality of that new relation to God which is exhibited in His Person.
   [742] Here, as in Schleiermacher, we are plainly back to the theory of
   a mere moral influence. Ritschl, like Dr. Bushnell, would cast his idea
   of Christ's death in the moulds of the altar; but this must be
   connected with his theory of the Old Testament sacrifices, which, he
   holds, had no reference to Atonement for sin, but only served to dispel
   the creature's distrust in drawing near to a great and awful God.
   Christ, in like manner, by His death, brings us near to God by
   dispelling distrust of God, and inspiring confidence in His grace.
   [743] What, finally, on this theory, becomes of the idea of guilt?
   Strictly speaking, guilt is not removed, but God admits us to
   fellowship with Himself, and to co-operation with Him in work for His
   kingdom, without our guilt, or feeling of guilt, forming any hindrance
   thereto. [744] This is what Ritschl understands by justification. It is
   the easier for him to take this view, that, as we saw before, guilt
   with him has little objective significance, and exists more for our own
   feeling than for God. [745] In proportion as this view is adopted,
   however, the experience of forgiveness becomes subjective also, and
   there remains nothing objective but the actual change of mind and
   feeling. [746] It is plain that we have here quite changed the centre
   of gravity in the Christian view of Redemption; and the only remedy is
   to restore the idea of guilt to its scriptural importance, which,
   again, necessitates a changed idea of its treatment. [747]

   The theories we are now to consider differ from those we have just had
   under review, in that they recognise an objective element in the
   Atonement, and in this way come nearer to the manifest teaching of
   Scripture. They recognise that Christ's work not only affects us
   subjectively in the way of moral influence, but is an objective work,
   on the ground of which God forgives sin, and receives us into
   fellowship with Himself. And the question they raise is, What is the
   nature of this objective element?

   4. The first answer which is given to this question is by that group of
   theories which find the essential feature in the Atonement in the
   surrender of the holy will of Christ to God. The idea of Atonement
   here, then, is the self-surrender of the human will to the Divine. This
   is Maurice's theory, but essentially also that of Rothe, Pressense,
   Bahr, Oehler, and many others. [748] Here, as in previous theories,
   Christ is regarded as the Head of the race, and as representing in
   Himself all humanity. In this humanity He offers up to God the perfect
   sacrifice of a will entirely surrendered to His service. As Maurice
   puts it, "Supposing the Father's will to be a will to all good;
   supposing the Son of God, being one with Him and Lord of man, to obey
   and fulfil in our flesh that will by entering into the lowest condition
   into which men had fallen through their sin; supposing this Man to be,
   for this reason, an object of continual complacency to His Father, and
   that complacency to be fully drawn out by the death of the cross;
   supposing His death to be a sacrifice, the only complete sacrifice ever
   offered, the entire surrender of the whole spirit and body to God,--is
   not this, in the highest sense, the Atonement? Is not the true, sinless
   root of humanity revealed; is not God in Him reconciled to man? Is not
   the cross the meeting-point between man and man, between man and God?"
   [749] That which, on this view, gives the sacrifice of Christ its
   value, is not the suffering, but the perfect will of obedience
   expressed in the suffering. When, according to the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, sacrifices and offerings, and whole burnt-offerings and
   sacrifices for sin, God would not, neither had pleasure therein, "then
   hath He said, Lo, I am come to do Thy will. He taketh away the first,
   that He may establish the second. By which will we have been
   sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for
   all." [750] This surrender of the will is the only kind of sacrifice
   God delights in, and it is the perfect Atonement. [751] The sin of
   humanity is its negation of the will of God, and the cross takes back
   that negation on behalf of humanity. This is brought into harmony with
   the Old Testament sacrifices by the theory that in these sacrifices it
   is not the death of the victim that is the essential thing, but the
   presentation of the blood. The death is only the means of obtaining the
   blood, which, as the vehicle of the pure life, the offerer presents to
   God as a covering for his own sin. [752]

   Again, there can be no doubt of the deep spiritual truth involved in
   this theory of the sacrifice which Christ offered for our Redemption.
   We may again say that, whatever else there is in the Atonement, there
   is this in it. Viewing Christ's death as a sacrifice, we cannot
   question that the nerve and core of the sacrifice was the holy will, in
   which, through the Eternal Spirit, He offered Himself without spot or
   blemish to God. [753] It was not the mere fact of the sufferings, but
   that which was the soul of the sufferings,--the holy, loving will in
   which they were borne, and the self-surrender to the will of the Father
   in them,--which gave them their spiritual value. [754] The only
   question is, Is this the whole of the explanation? Does this exhaust
   the meaning of Christ's sacrifice? Does this fill up the whole of the
   scriptural testimony regarding it? And, however fascinated one may be
   for a time with this theory, it seems impossible permanently to rest in
   it as adequate. I do not go back on the inadequacy of a theory which
   lays the whole stress of Atonement on self-sacrifice, without saying
   sacrifice for what, or in what, but come at once to the point in which
   it seems peculiarly to fail. That point is, that the Scriptures appear
   to assert a direct relation of the sacrifice of Christ to the sin and
   guilt of men,--a direct expiatory power to remove that guilt,--a
   relation, not only to God's commanding will, but to His condemning
   will. Not only the Old and New Testament doctrine of the righteousness
   and holiness of God, and of His judicial attitude towards sin,--not
   only the extreme gravity of the scriptural doctrine of guilt, but the
   deepest feeling of the awakened conscience itself, demands that guilt
   shall not be simply overlooked, but that it shall be dealt with also in
   the transacting of Christ with God for man, and that the forgiveness
   which is sealed in His death. shall have placed on it the holy sanction
   of justice as well as that of love. I go on, therefore--

   5. To look at theories which not only affirm the offering up of a holy
   will of obedience in Christ's sacrifice, but recognise its relation to
   guilt. Such theories include, after all, among their representatives,
   the great bulk of the ablest and most scriptural theologians--as
   Dorner, Luthardt, Martensen, Oosterzee, Godet, etc.; and an undesigned
   testimony is borne to their substantial truth by the approximations
   often made to them in theories of a different tendency, and by the
   difficulty felt in avoiding language which would imply the expiatory
   view, as well as by the studied accommodation of all parties, as far as
   possible, to the recognised language of the Church. Yet the dislike of
   many, and these often men of the most spiritual mind, to the forms of
   the imputation theology, their inability to rest in anything which
   seems to them to wear an air of legal fiction, suggests to us the
   necessity of seeking to approach even this side of the subject from
   within, and of trying to connect it with spiritual laws which will
   commend it to the conscience and the heart.

   I may begin here with a theory which, though it opposes itself directly
   to the idea of penal sufferings, yet deals with this question of the
   relation of Atonement to guilt, and has, I think, valuable light to
   throw upon the subject,--more, perhaps, than is sometimes admitted,--I
   refer to the theory of Dr. John M'Leod Campbell. Dr. Campbell starts
   with the Incarnation, and his idea is to see the Atonement developing
   itself naturally and necessarily out of Christ's relation to men as the
   Incarnate Son--which is, I think, a sound point of view. Next, he
   distinguishes in Christ's work two sides--(l) a dealing with men on the
   part of God, and (2) a dealing with God on the part of men; which,
   again, I think, is a true distinction. The peculiarity of his theory,
   and here undoubtedly it becomes artificial and indefensible, lies in
   the proposal to substitute a vicarious, repentance for sins, and
   confession of sins, for the vicarious endurance of the penalties of
   transgression. [755] There is here, first, a confusion between
   repentance for sins and confession of them. The idea that Christ could
   in any sense repent of the sins of the humanity which He represented,
   could bring to God "a perfect repentance" for them, is one totally
   inadmissible, even though his premiss were granted, which it cannot be,
   that a perfect repentance would of itself constitute Atonement. That
   Christ should confess our sins in His high-priestly intercession for us
   with God is, on the other hand, not inadmissible, but is rightly
   classed as a part of His substitutionary activity for us. It has its
   analogies in the intercessory confessions of Moses, Daniel, and
   Nehemiah, and may very well be regarded by us as an element in the
   Atonement.

   When we get behind Dr. Campbell's words, and look at the kernel of his
   theory, and even at what he means to convey by these unfortunate
   expressions about a perfect repentance, we obtain light on the
   Atonement which is, I think, valuable. The point of this theory, as I
   understand it--that on which Dr. Campbell himself constantly insists
   through all his volume--is, that with the most perfect apprehension of
   what the sin of man was, on the one hand, and of what the mind of God
   towards sin, and sin's due at the hands of God, were, on the other,
   there went up from the depths of Christ's sinless humanity a perfect
   "Amen" to the righteous judgment of God against sin. There must,
   therefore, be recognised, even on Dr. M'Leod Campbell's theory, a
   certain dealing of Christ with God's wrath--with His judicial
   condemnation upon sin. "Christ, in dealing with God on behalf of men,"
   he says, "must be conceived of as dealing with the righteous wrath of
   God against sin, and as according to it that which was due." [756] "Let
   us consider," he says again, "this Amen' from the depths of the
   humanity of Christ to the Divine condemnation of sin. What is it in
   relation to God's wrath against sin? What place has it in Christ's
   dealing with that wrath? I answer, He who so responds to the Divine
   wrath against sin, saying, Thou art righteous, O Lord, who judgest so,'
   is necessarily receiving the full apprehension and realisation of that
   wrath, as well as of that sin against which it comes forth, into His
   soul and spirit, into the bosom of the Divine humanity, and so
   receiving it, He responds to it with a perfect response--a response
   from the depths of that Divine humanity, and in that perfect response
   He absorbs it." [757] If, however, this were all that was in Dr.
   Campbell's theory, we should still have to say that, valuable as the
   suggestion is which it contains, it is only a half-truth. It will be
   observed that, so far as these quotations go, it is only a vivid mental
   realisation of God's wrath against sin to which we are to conceive
   Christ as responding. He has the perfect realisation of what sin is in
   man; He has the perfect realisation of God's mind towards sin; but He
   is Himself in no sense brought under the experience of that wrath, or
   of its penal effects: it may be thought by many He could not be. And
   this might seem to detract from the value of that "Amen" from the
   depths of Christ's humanity on which all the stress is laid. To take an
   analogous case, it is one thing to be patient and resigned under a
   vivid mental realisation of possible trials, another thing to be
   resigned under actual experience of sorrow. Yet the only resignation
   which has worth is that which has been actually tested in the fires of
   trial. In order, therefore, that Christ's "Amen" to the judgment of God
   against sin might have its fullest content, it would appear to be
   necessary that it should be uttered, not under a mere ideal realisation
   of what God's wrath against sin is, but under the actual pressure of
   the judgment which that wrath inflicts. Is this possible? Strange to
   say, with all his protests against Christ being thought of as enduring
   penal evils, it is precisely this view to which Dr. Campbell in the end
   comes. He is quite awake to the fact of the unique character of
   Christ's sufferings; quite aware that they involved elements found in
   no ordinary martyr's death; quite conscious that an "Amen" uttered, as
   he calls it, "in naked existence," [758] would have little value. It
   must be uttered under actual experience of the evils which this
   judgment of God lays on humanity, especially under the experience of
   death. The closing period of Christ's life, he says, was one of which
   the distinctive character was suffering in connection with a permitted
   hour and power of darkness; [759] while his remarks on our Lord's
   tasting death are so important and apposite that I cannot forbear
   quoting one or two of them. "When I think of our Lord as tasting
   death," he says, "it seems to me as if He alone ever truly tasted
   death. . . Further, as our Lord alone truly tasted death, so to Him
   alone had death its perfect meaning as the wages of sin. . . . For
   thus, in Christ's honouring of the righteous law of God, the sentence
   of the law was included, as well as the mind of God which that sentence
   expressed. . . . Had sin existed in men as mere spirits, death could
   not have been the wages of sin, and any response to the Divine mind
   concerning sin which would have been an Atonement for their sin, could
   only have had spiritual elements; but man being by the constitution of
   humanity capable of death, and death having come as the wages of sin,
   it was not simply sin that had to be dealt with, but an existing law
   with its penalty of death, and that death as already incurred. So that
   it was not only the Divine mind that had to be responded to, but also
   that expression of the Divine mind which was contained in God's making
   death the wages of sin." [760] It is evident how nearly in such
   passages Dr. Campbell comes to a theory of the Atonement which holds
   that Christ, as a member of humanity and the new Head of the race,
   really bore in His own Person the penal evils which are the expression
   of the wrath of God against the sin of the world. He maintains, in
   deed, that for Christ these were not really penal evils; but, in the
   light of the explanations just given, the difference seems to resolve
   itself mainly into one of nomenclature. Whatever sense we may give to
   that expression, "Christ bore the wrath of God for us," it is held by
   no one to mean that Christ was personally the object of His Father's
   anger. All that is meant is that by Divine ordainment He passed under
   the experience of evils which are the expression of God's wrath against
   sin, or a judgment laid on humanity on account of that sin. The
   peculiarly valuable idea, as I take it, which Dr. Campbell brings to
   the elucidation of Christ's sufferings as atoning is--that it was not
   simply the patience and resignation with which lie bore them, not
   simply the surrender of His will to God in them, but the perfect
   acknowledgment, which accompanied His endurance of them, of the
   righteousness of God in their ordainment, which made them a
   satisfaction for sin. "By that perfect response in Amen to the mind of
   God, in relation to sill," as he himself expresses it, "is the wrath of
   God rightly met, and that is accorded to Divine justice which is its
   due, and could alone satisfy it" [761]

   It is, I own, difficult to frame a theory to which no exception can be
   taken, which shall show how the sufferings of Christ, which were in
   large part sufferings endured for righteousness' sake, had at the same
   time an expiatory value; yet it is the clear teaching of Scripture that
   they possess this character. As aids to the apprehension of the
   subject, the facts remain that these sufferings of the sinless Sell of
   God were voluntarily under taken, and (what can be said of no other of
   the race) wholly undeserved; that Christ did enter, as far as a sinless
   Being could, into the penal evils of our state, and finally submitted
   to death--the doom which sin has brought on our humanity; that He did
   this with a perfect consciousness and realisation of the relation of
   these evils to sill; that lie experienced the full bitterness of these
   evils, and. especially in His last hours, w as permitted to endure them
   without even the alleviations and spiritual comforts which many of His
   own people enjoy; that there were mysterious elements ill His
   sufferings, which outward causes do not seem adequate to explain (e.g.
   the agony in Gethsemane, the awful darkness of His soul on Calvary).
   which appear related to His position as our Sin-hearer;--finally, that
   in this mortal sorrow He still retains unbroken His relation to the
   Father, overcomes our spiritual enemies, so transacts with God for men,
   so offers Himself to God in substitutionary love on our behalf, so
   recognises and honours the justice of God in His condemnation of sin,
   and in the evils that were befalling Himself in consequence of that
   sin, that His death may fitly be regarded as a satisfaction to
   righteousness for us--the Redemption of the world, not, indeed, ipso
   facto, but for those who through faith appropriate His sacrifice, die
   in spirit with Him in His death, and make His righteousness the ground
   of their hope.

   Is exception taken--as it was by the Socinians--to the idea of the
   innocent satisfying for the guilty h Is it asked, How should the
   righteous suffer for the guilty? Is it just that they should do so? Or,
   how can the sufferings of the righteous atone for the unrighteous? I
   would point out ill answer that there are two questions here. The first
   relates to a matter of fact--the suffering of the righteous for the
   guilty. We know that they do so. It is the commonest fact in our
   experience. In the organic relation in which we stand to each other it
   could not he otherwise. The penalties of evildoing are probably never
   confined to the actual wrong-doer, but overflow upon others, and
   sometimes involve them in untold misery. To impeach the justice of this
   is to impeach the justice of an organic constitution of the race. Thus
   far, then, we can say that Christ is no exception to this universal
   law; nay, He is the highest exemplification of it. Christ could not
   enter the world without receiving upon Him the brunt of its evils. Just
   because He was the infinitely pure and holy One, they fell on Him with
   greater severity. A writer like Bushnell here often uses the strongest
   language. He speaks of Christ as incarnated into the curse of the
   world. "It is," he says, "as if the condemnations of God were upon Him,
   as they are on all the solidarities of the race into which He is come."
   [762] "It means," he says again, "that He is incarnated into common
   condition with us, under what is called the curse. . . . He must become
   a habitant with us, a fellow-nature, a brother; and that He could not
   be without being entered into what is our principal distinction as
   being under the curse. . . . He has it upon Him, consciously, as the
   curse or penal shame and disaster of our transgression." [763] The
   question is not, therefore, How should Christ, the sinless One, suffer
   for the guilty? but, How can sufferings thus endured become expiatory
   or atoning? And this I have tried to answer by pointing out the unique
   relation which Christ sustains to our race, in virtue of which He could
   become its Representative and Sin-bearer; and, secondly, by indicating
   how in our humanity He must, as Dr. M'Leod Campbell says, have related
   Himself to our sins--not only patiently and lovingly enduring
   sufferings, not only yielding up to His Father a will of obedience in
   them, but viewing them in the light of their causes, entering fully
   into God's judgment on the sin of which they were the consequences, and
   rendering to God in our nature a full and perfect and glorifying
   response to His justice in them. In this way His sufferings might well
   become, like those of the Servant of the Lord in Isaiah liii.,
   expiatory.

   Gathering together, in closing, the various aspects of Christ's work
   which have been brought before us, we see, I think, the truth of a
   previous remark that the true or full view of Christ's work in
   Redemption is wide enough to include them all--takes up the elements of
   truth in every one of them. A complete view of Christ's work will
   include the fact that in the Incarnation a new Divine life has entered
   humanity; will include the fact that Christ is our perfect
   Representative before God as the new Head of the race, and the wearer
   of our humanity in its pure and perfect form; will include the fact of
   an organic relation of Christ with all the members of the race, in
   virtue of which He entered, not merely outwardly, but in the most real
   and vital way, into the fellowship of our sin and suffering, and truly
   bore us on His heart before God as a merciful and faithful High Priest;
   will include the idea of a vocation which Christ had as Founder of the
   kingdom of God on earth, though this vocation will embrace, not only
   the Revelation of the Father's character and doing His will among men,
   but also the making reconciliation for the sins of the people; will
   include the fact of a holy and perfect and continuous surrender of
   Christ's will to God, as an offering, through the Eternal Spirit, in
   humanity, of that which man ought to render, but is unable in his own
   strength to give--the presentation to God in humanity, therefore, of a
   perfect righteousness, on the ground of which humanity stands in a new
   relation to God, and is accepted in the Beloved; will include, finally,
   a dealing with God in reference to the guilt of sin, which is not
   simply a sympathetic realisation of the burden of that guilt as it
   rests on us, nor yet simply a confession of sins in our name, nor yet
   simply an acknowledgment in humanity of the righteousness of God in
   visiting our sins with wrath and judgment, but is a positive entrance
   into the penal events of our condition, and, above all, into death as
   the last and most terrible of these evils, in order that in these also
   He might become one with us, and under that experience might render to
   God what was due to His judicial righteousness,--an Atonement which, as
   Dr. M'Leod Campbell says, has in it an "Amen" from the depths of our
   humanity towards the righteous judgment of God on our sins. So far from
   this latter aspect of Christ's work--the judicial--being to be thrown
   into the background, it is, I think, the one which the apostolic
   theology specially fastens upon as the ground of the remission of sins,
   and the means by which the sinner is brought into a relation of peace
   with God--the ground, as Bunyan phrases it, on which God "justly
   justifies the sinner."

   Christ, as the Son of God, incarnate in our nature, is the only one
   qualified to undertake this work; and as Son of God and Son of Man He
   did it. He alone could enter, on the one hand, into the meaning of the
   sin of the world; on the other, into a realisation of all that was due
   to that sin from God, not minimising either the sin or the
   righteousness, but doing justice to both, upholding righteousness, yet
   opening to the world the gates of a forgiving mercy. In Him we see that
   done which we could not do; we see that brought which we could not
   bring; we see that reparation made to a broken law which we could not
   make; we see, at the same time, a righteousness consummated we long to
   make our own, a victory over the world we long to share, a will of love
   we long to have reproduced in ourselves, a grandeur of self sacrifice
   we long to imitate. And, appropriating that sacrifice, not only in its
   atoning merit, but in its inward spirit, we know ourselves redeemed and
   reconciled.

   [695] To prevent ambiguity, it is desirable that I should refer here
   for a moment to the meaning of this word "atonement." It is the
   equivalent of the New Testament word katallage, which is always
   translated in the Revised Version "reconciliation," and of the German
   words "VersÃ¶hnung" and "SÃ¼hnung." It is therefore capable of a wider
   and of a more special sense. In both cases it refers to the
   "reconciliation" or "making-at-one" of mankind and God, and in New
   Testament usage implies that this reconciliation is effected through
   expiation or propitiation. But in the one case it denotes the actual
   state of reconciliation with God into which believers are introduced
   through Christ, whose work is then regarded as the means to this end;
   whereas in the other it denotes the reconciling act itself--mankind
   being viewed as objectively reconciled to God in the work or death of
   His Son, which is the same the term ordinarily bears when we speak of
   the Atonement. Dr. Hodge would discard this term altogether because of
   its ambiguity, and substitute for the latter meaning of it the term
   "satisfaction."--Systematic Theology, ii. p. 469. lint "satisfaction"
   is too narrow and exclusively forensic a term to express all that is
   implied in the reconciling act.

   Scientific Basis of Faith (a disciple of this school): "I do not speak
   of the Incarnation as one act and the Atonement as another--they are
   one and the same Divine act, which in itself is called the Incarnation,
   and in its results is called the Atonement. The act of the Son of God
   in becoming a partaker of our nature is the Incarnation; the result of
   this act, in making us partakers of the Divine nature, is the Atonement
   or Reconciliation; though these latter words are both of them
   inadequate."--P. 384.

   forgiveness of sins is indicated in the following sentence: "The

   in the moment of reconciliation is the forgiveness of sin"--P. 105.

   [728] Ritschl rightly remarks that what Schleiermacher calls
   reconciliation with God is really reconciliation with evil,--"the
   reconciliation of man with suffering, with his position in the world,
   which as sinner he had traced to his guilt."--Recht. und Ver. i. p. 470
   (Eng. trans.).

   [733] This is admirably worked out in the section on the fruitfulness
   of sacrifice in Bishop Westcott's The Victory of the Cross, ii. 23-35.

   [734] The work of Christ he conceives of "as beginning at the point of
   sacrifice, vicarious sacrifice, ending at the same, and being just this
   all through."--Vicarious Sacrifice, Introduction, p. 35 (1886). On the
   sense in which he does regard Christ's work as declarative, i.e. as a
   Revelation of the eternal vicarious sufferings of the Godhead, see
   below.

   [735] Vicarious Sacrifice, pp. 17, 18. "The suffering of Christ," he
   says, "was vicarious suffering in no way peculiar to Him, save in
   degree."--P. 68.

   [736] In this work Dr. Bushnell develops the idea already suggested in
   his earlier book (pp. 18, 35, 37), that Christ's sacrifice has its
   chief significance as a revelation of the eternal sacrifice in God's
   own nature. "The transactional matter of Christ's life and death," he
   says, "is a specimen chapter, so to speak, of the infinite hook that
   records the eternal going on of God's blessed nature within. . . . All
   God's forgiving dispositions are dateless, and are cast in this mould.
   The Lambhood nature is in Him, and the cross set up, before the
   Incarnate Son arrives. . . . I have already said that the propitiation,
   so called, is not a fact accomplished in time, but an historic matter
   represented in that way, to exhibit the interior, ante-mundane,
   eternally proceeding sacrifice of the Lamb that was slain before the
   foundation of the world"--Pp. 60, 61, 74. This, surely, is to give
   Christ's work something of a docetic character.

   [744] Ibid. p. 32.

   [745] Ritschl's view of Christ's sufferings and their relation to
   forgiveness is expounded at length in his Recht. und Vers. 3rd ed. iii.
   417-428, 505-533. Cf. specially pp. 422, 511, 512, 513, 524, 574.
   "Christ's death, in the view of the apostles, is the compendious
   expression for the fact that Christ has inwardly maintained His
   religious unity with God and His revelation-position in the whole
   course of His life."--P. 511.

   [746] It is not remarkable, therefore, that Herrmann, as quoted by
   Lipsius, should speak of the forgiveness of sins as "nothing at all
   particular" (ganz nichts besonderes).--Die Ritschl'sche Theologie, p.
   12. Herrmann certainly expresses himself very differently in his
   Verkehr, pp. 39, 40 (2nd ed. p. 103).

   [747] A kindred view of atonement to Ritschl's is that of F. A. B.
   Nitzsch in his Lehrbuch der Evang. Dogmatik, ii. (1892). "God," he
   holds, "could only forgive the sin of humanity if the representative of
   humanity was able to afford him the security of a moral renewal of the
   same, the security of a new humanity. But this Christ did as the
   Beginner of the new humanity, and as Founder of a community upon which
   He could take over His own fellowship with God. We cannot, therefore,
   say that the doing of Christ first made it possible for God the Father
   to he graciously disposed to men, but rather that He made it possible
   for God to reveal His grace."--P. 508. Christ is therefore a guarantee
   to God for our future sanctification. This is not a thought which we
   find prominent in Scripture, while the scriptural idea that Christ
   reconciles us to God by removal of our guilt is overlooked.

   [748] Cf. Rothe's Dogmatik, ii. pp. 265-269; Pressense, Apostolic Age,
   p. 274 (Eng. trans. 4th ed.); Bahr, Symbolik, etc.

   [750] Heb. x. 5-10 (R.V.).

   [751] Erskine of Linlathen's theory was akin to this: "The true and
   proper sacrifice for our sin" is "the shedding out of the blood of our
   will--of that will which had offended."--Doctrine of Election, 2nd ed.
   p. 156.

   [752] Cf. e.g., Oehler, Theology of Old Testament, i. p. 411 (Eng.
   trans.); Bahr, Symbolik (see his view criticised by Dorner, System of
   Doctrine, iii. pp. 407, 408; and Fairbairn, Typology, 3rd ed. ii. pp.
   290-297). Thus also Rothe, Riehm, Nitzsch, Schultz, etc.

   [753] Heb. ix. 14, x. 4-10.

   [754] This is the point of view emphasised in Bishop Westcott's The
   Victory of the Cross, which may be classed with this group of theories.
   The key-word; of the book are Fatherhood, Incarnation, Sacrifice.
   Sufferings in general are viewed in the light of discipline--"a
   revelation of the Fatherhood of God, who brings back His children to
   Himself in righteousness and love."--P. 82. Christ bore these
   sufferings according to the mind of God as "entering into the Divine
   law of purifying chastisement," "realising in every pain the healing
   power of a Father's wisdom."--Pp. 69, 82. But in what sense can we
   speak of "purifying chastisement" and "healing power" in the case of
   the Sinless One? Bishop Westcott himself has expressions which
   recognise a deeper relation of sufferings to sin, as where, e.g.,
   Christ is spoken of as gathering "into one supreme sacrifice the
   bitterness of death, the last penalty of sin, knowing all it means, and
   hearing it as He knows"; and His sufferings are held as showing "His
   complete acceptance of the just, the inevitable sentence of God on the
   sin at humanity."--Pp. 68, 81. The thoughts of the book are not worked
   out into perfect clearness.

   not be "judicial." and yet up to a certain point "corrective"?

LECTURE IX.

  THE INCARNATION AND HUMAN DESTINY.

    Introductory

   Every view of the world has its eschatology. It cannot help raising the
   question of the whither, as well as of the what and the whence? "O my
   Lord," said Daniel to the angel, "what shall be the end of these
   things?" [764] What is the end, the final destiny, of the individual?
   Does he perish at death, or does he enter into another state of being;
   and under what conditions of happiness or woe does he exist there? What
   is the end, the final aim, of the great whole; that far-off Divine
   event to which the whole creation moves? It is vain to tell man not to
   ask these questions. He will ask them, and must ask them. He will pore
   over every scrap of fact, or trace of law, which seems to give any
   indication of an answer. He will try from the experience of the past,
   and the knowledge of the present, to deduce what the future shall be.
   He will peer as far as he can into the unseen; and, where knowledge
   fails, will weave from his hopes and trusts pictures and conjectures.
   It is not religions only, but philosophy and science also, which have
   their eschatologies. The Stoics had their conceptions of world-cycles,
   when everything, reabsorbed in the primal fire, was produced anew
   exactly as before. The Buddhists had their kalpas, or world-ages,
   periods of destruction and restoration, "during which (as in
   Brahmanism) constant universes are supposed to appear, disappear, and
   reappear"; [765] new worlds, phoenix-like, incessantly rising out of
   the ruins of the old. The pessimist Hartmann has his eschatology as
   truly as the New Testament has its. [766] Kant speculated, in his
   Theory of the Heavens, on the birth and death of worlds; and Strauss
   compares the cosmos to one of those tropical trees on which,
   simultaneously, here a blossom bursts into flower, there a ripe fruit
   drops from the bough. [767] How is the science of to-day seen peering
   on into the future, trying to make out what shall be the end of these
   things; whither the changes, and transformations, and integrations, and
   dissolutions of the physical universe all tend; and what fate is in
   store for the earth, and for the physical system as a whole! Mr.
   Spencer has his eschatology, and speculates on a boundless space,
   holding here and there extinct suns, fated to remain thus for ever;
   though he clings to the hope that, in some way he knows not, out of the
   ashes of this old universe a new universe will arise. [768] The authors
   of The Unseen Universe say, "What happens to our system will happen
   likewise to the whole visible universe, which will, if finite, become
   in time a lifeless mass, if indeed it be not doomed to utter
   desolation. In fine, it will become old and effete, no less truly than
   the individual,--it is a glorious garment this visible universe, but
   not an immortal one--we must look elsewhere, if we are to be clothed
   with immortality as with a garment." [769]

   The Christian view of the world, also, has its eschatology--one too, in
   its physical issues, not very different from that just described. The
   Christian view, however, is positive, where that of science is
   negative; ethical, where it is material; human, where it is cosmogonic;
   ending in personal immortality, where this ends in extinction and
   death. The eschatology of Christianity springs from its character as a
   teleological religion. The highest type of "Weltanschauung" is that
   which seeks to grasp the unity of the world through the conception of
   an end or aim. It is only through a conception of the world that is
   itself unified that man can give a true unity to his life--only in
   reference to an aim or end that he can organise his life to a
   consistent whole. On the cycle hypothesis, no satisfactory view of life
   is possible. All is vanity and vexation of spirit. A truly purposeful
   view of life is only possible on the basis of a world-view which
   gathers itself up to a highest definite aim. As giving this,
   Christianity is the teleological religion par excellence. It is, says
   Dorner, the only absolute teleological religion. [770] In one other
   respect Christianity agrees with the higher speculation--scientific and
   other--and that is in its breadth and scope, extending in its issues
   far beyond this little spot called earth, and touching in its influence
   the remotest regions of creation.

   I. Before entering directly on eschatological questions, it may be
   worth our while, in connection with the fact just mentioned, to glance
   at the objection sometimes raised to Christianity from the enlargement
   of our knowledge of the physical universe through modern
   discoveries--chiefly through astronomy. The enormous expansion of our
   ideas in regard to the extent of the physical universe brought about
   through the telescope, and the corresponding sense of the
   insignificance of our planet, awakened by comparison with the gigantic
   whole, is supposed by many to be fatal to belief in Christianity.
   Strauss boldly affirms that the Copernican system gave the death-blow
   to the Christian view of the world. [771] So long as the earth was
   believed to be the centre of the universe, and the only inhabited spot
   in it, so long was it possible to maintain that God had a peculiar love
   to the inhabitants of our world, and had sent His Son for their
   Redemption. But when the true relation of the earth to the sun, and to
   the other planets of the system, was discovered--when, beyond this, the
   infinite depths of the heavens were laid bare, with their innumerable
   suns, galaxies, and constellations, to which our own sun, with its
   attendant planets, is but as a drop in the immeasurable ocean--then the
   idea that this little globe of ours--this insignificant speck--should
   become the scene of so stupendous a Divine drama as the Christian
   religion represents; should be the peculiar object of God's favours,
   and the recipient of His revelations; that, above all, the Son of God
   should become incarnate on its surface,--seemed nothing less than
   incredible. In a universe teeming with worlds, presumably inhabited by
   intelligences of every order and degree, it is thought preposterous to
   connect the Deity in this peculiar and transcendent way with one of the
   very smallest of them.

   Here, first, since the objection is made in the name of science, it
   might fairly be asked how far the premiss on which it rests--the
   assumption of innumerable spheres peopled with such intelligences as we
   have in man (I do not refer to angelic intelligences, for the Christian
   view has always admitted these, without our thoughts of the greatness
   of the Christian Redemption being thereby lessened, but corporeal
   inhabitants of other planets and worlds)--how far this assumption is
   scientifically established, or is even matter of plausible conjecture.
   Kant declared that he would not hesitate to stake his all on the truth
   of the proposition--if there were any way of bringing it to the test of
   experience--that at least some one of the planets which we see is
   inhabited; [772] but others may not be prepared to share his
   confidence. Of direct scientific evidence, of course, there is none,
   and the argument from analogy is weakened rather than strengthened by
   the progress of modern discovery. If astronomy has been extending our
   views of the universe in space, geology has been extending our views of
   our own world backwards in time, and it has been pointed out that,
   though preparation was being made through the millions of years of that
   long past, it is only in quite recent times that man appeared upon its
   surface, and then under conditions which we have no reason to suppose
   exist in any other planet of our system. [773] Are there not worlds in
   the making, as well as worlds already made? Certain it is, that of the
   seven hundred and fifty-one parts, or thereabouts, into which our solar
   system [774] can be divided, life, such as we know it, or can conceive
   of it, is not found in seven hundred and fifty of them, for the sun
   monopolises that enormous proportion of the whole for himself; and of
   the remaining one part, it is only an insignificant fraction in which
   the physical conditions exist which render any of the higher conditions
   of life possible. [775] If the same proportion prevails through the
   universe, the area reserved for rational life will be correspondingly
   restricted. But, in truth, we know nothing of planets in other parts of
   the heavens at all, or even whether--except in one or two problematical
   instances--such bodies exist. [776] What if, after all, our little
   planet should be the Eden of the planetary system--the only spot on
   which a place has been prepared for rational life, or in which the
   conditions favourable to its blossoming forth have been found? [777] It
   is a singular circumstance that the objection here urged against
   Christianity is not exclusively applicable to it, but bears as strongly
   against all those speculative systems--Hegelianism, Schopenhauerism,
   Hartmannism, etc.--which have been hatched in the full light of the
   nineteenth century. Here, too, it is assumed that our planet stands
   alone as the place in which the Absolute has come to consciousness of
   himself (or itself), and where the great drama of his historical
   evolution is unfolded--where, in Hegelian phrase, God is incarnate in
   man! [778]

   Apart from such considerations, however, the real reply to this
   objection to the Christian view of the world is that it is merely a
   quantitative one. Be the physical magnitude of the universe what it
   may, it remains the fact that, on this little planet, life has
   effloresced into reason; that we have here a race of rational beings
   who bear God's image, and are capable of knowing, loving, and obeying
   Him. This is a fact against which it is absurd to put into comparison
   any mere quantities of inanimate matter--any number of suns, nebulae,
   and planets. Even suppose that there were other inhabited worlds, or
   any number of them, this does not detract from the soul's value in this
   world. Mind, if it has the powers we know it has, is not less great
   because other minds may exist elsewhere. Man is not less great, because
   he is not alone great. If he is a spiritual being,--if he has a soul of
   infinite worth, which is the Christian assumption,--that fact is not
   affected though there were a whole universeful of other spiritual
   beings, as indeed the Christian Church has always believed there is.
   The truth is, what we have underlying this objection is that very
   anthropomorphism in thinking about God against which the objection is
   directed. It is thought that, while it might be worthy of God to care
   for man if he existed alone, it is derogatory to God's greatness to
   think of him when there are so many other objects in the universe. Or
   it is thought that God is a Being so exalted that He will lose sight of
   the individual in the crowd. Those who think thus must have very
   unworthy ideas of the Being whom they wish to exalt; must forget, too,
   that the universe can only exist on the condition that God is present
   in the little as in the great; that His knowledge, power, and care
   extend, not to things in the mass, but to each atom of matter
   separately, to each tiniest blade of grass, to each insect on the wing,
   and animalcule in the drop of water. It is the Bible which gives the
   true philosophy, when it teaches that the same God who cares for stars
   cares also for souls; that the very hairs of our head are all numbered;
   that not even a sparrow falls to the ground without our heavenly
   Father. [779]

   But the question still remains, even if all these bright worlds were
   inhabited--which they are not,--inhabited by rational beings like to
   man himself,--are they sinful? Sin retains its awful significance in
   the universe, no matter how many worlds there may be. If this world
   alone is sinful, then it is worthy of God to redeem it. Have men's
   hearts not recognised the Divineness of that parable of Christ about
   the lost sheep? Is it not the Divinest thing that God can do to seek
   and to save the lost? Suppose that this universe were as full of
   intelligent life as the objection represents, but that this world is
   the one lost sheep of the Divine flock, would it not be worthy of the
   Good Shepherd to seek it out and save it? Shall its size prevent? Then
   is the worth of the soul a thing to be weighed in scales? Mr. Spencer,
   in one passage of his writings, thinks he has destroyed the case for
   Revelation, when he asks us if we can believe that "the Cause to which
   we can put no limits in space or time, and of which our entire solar
   system is a relatively infinitesimal product, took the disguise of a
   man for the purpose of covenanting with a shepherd-chief in Syria."
   [780] He first defines God in terms which put Him infinitely far away
   from us, and then asks us to combine with this a conception which seems
   to contradict it. But what if God is not only the "Cause" of all
   things--the infinitely great Creator of stars and systems--but, as Mr.
   Spencer a own principles might lead him to hold, One also infinitely
   near to us--

     "Speak to Him, thou, for He hears, and spirit with spirit can meet;
     Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands or feet." [781]
     --

   and, beyond this, infinite goodness and love as well,--is it then so
   strange that He should draw a Syrian shepherd to His side, and should
   establish a covenant with him which had for its ultimate aim, not that
   shepherd's personal aggrandisement, but the blessing, through him, of
   all mankind?

   But finally, and this is the complete answer to the objection, if the
   Christian view is true, the scope of God's purpose is not confined to
   this little planet, but embraces all the realms of creation. [782] The
   Incarnation is not a fact the significance of which is confined to
   earth. The Scriptures do not so represent it, but seek rather to
   impress us with the thought of how wide this purpose of God is, how
   extensive in its sweep, how far-reaching in its issues. The objection
   to the Christian scheme with many, I fancy, will rather be, that with
   its base on earth it rises too high; that when it speaks to us of the
   bearing of the gospel on different parts of creation, of angels
   desiring to look into it, of principalities and powers in the heavenly
   places being instructed by it in the many-sided wisdom of God,--above
   all, of all things in heaven and in earth being gathered up in Christ,
   [783] --it presents us with a plan the magnitude of which soars beyond
   our powers of belief. But if the Divine plan is on a scale of this
   grandeur, why complain because its startingpoint is this physically
   small globe? The answer to this objection, as to the similar one drawn
   from the earthly lowliness of Christ, must be, Respice finem--Look to
   the end!

   II. In proceeding now to deal directly with the eschatological
   relations of the Christian view, it is to be remembered that it stands
   differently with lines of prophecy projected into the future from what
   it does with facts already past. In dealing with the history of God's
   past Revelations--with the ages before the Advent, with the earthly
   life and Revelation of Jesus Christ, with the subsequent course of
   God's Providence in His Church--we are dealing with that which has
   already been. It stands in concrete reality before us, and we can
   reason from it as a thing known in its totality and its details. But
   when the subject of Revelation is that which is yet to be, especially
   that which is yet to be under forms and conditions of which we have no
   direct experience, the case is widely altered. Here it is at most
   outlines we can look for; and even these outlines will be largely
   clothed in figure and symbol; the spiritual kernel will seek material
   investiture to body itself forth; the conditions of the future will
   require to be presented largely in forms borrowed from known relations.
   [784] The outstanding thoughts will be sufficiently apparent, but the
   forms in which these thoughts are cast will partake of metaphor and
   image.

   Examples of undue literalism in the interpretation of prophetic
   language will occur to every one; as an example on the other side, I
   may instance Ritschl, who, because of the figurative character of the
   language employed, sweeps the whole of the New Testament eschatology on
   one side, and simply takes no account of it. This is a drastic method,
   which makes us wonder why, if these representations convey no
   intelligible representations to the mind, use was made of them at all.
   With Ritschl, the sole thing of value is the idea of the kingdom of
   God, for the realisation of which we are to labour in this world. The
   form which the kingdom of God will assume beyond this life we cannot
   know, and need not concern ourselves about. The recoil from this
   one-sided position of Ritschl is seen in the further development of his
   school, particularly in Kaftan, who precisely reverses Ritschl's
   standpoint, and transports the good of the kingdom of God entirely into
   the life beyond. "The certainty of an eternal life in a kingdom of
   God," he says, "which is above the world, which lies to us as yet in
   the beyond, is the very nerve of our Christian piety." [785] This is an
   exaggeration on the other side, in opposition to which the truth of
   Ritschl's view has to be contended for, that there is a kingdom of God
   to be striven for even in this world. What did Christ come for, if not
   to impart a new life to humanity, which, working from within outwards,
   is destined to transform all human relations--all family and social
   life, all industry and commerce, all art and literature, all government
   and relations among peoples--till the kingdoms of this world are become
   the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ? [786] Whether more slowly
   or more rapidly, whether peacefully or, as Scripture seems to indicate,
   by a succession of crises, surely this grand result of a kingdom of God
   will be brought about; and it is our duty and privilege to pray and
   labour for it. What is the reproach which is sometimes brought against
   Christianity by its enemies, but that of "other-worldliness"--of
   exclusive devotion to a good beyond this life, to the neglect of
   interests lying immediately to hand? And what is the remedy for this
   reproach, but to show that Christianity is a power also for temporal
   and social salvation, a leaven which is to permeate the whole lump of
   humanity? It is on this side that a great and fruitful field opens
   itself up for Christian effort in the present day; on this side that
   Christianity finds itself in touch with some of the most characteristic
   movements of the time. The ideals of the day are pre-eminently social;
   the key-word of Positivism is "Altruism"--the organisation of humanity
   for social efforts; the call is to a "service of humanity"; [787] the
   air is full of ideas, schemes, Utopias, theories of social reform; and
   we who believe that Christianity is the motive power which alone Can
   effectually attain what these systems of men are striving after, are
   surely bound to put our faith to the proof, and show to men that in
   deed and in truth, and not in word only, the kingdom of God has come
   nigh to them. We know something of what Christianity did in the Roman
   Empire as a power of social purification and reform; [788] of what it
   did in the Middle Ages in the Christianising and disciplining of
   barbarous nations; of the power it has been in modern times as the
   inspiration of the great moral and philanthropic movements of the
   century; [789] and this power of Christianity is likely to be yet
   greater in the future than in the past. There is yet vast work to be
   accomplished ere the kingdom of God is fully come. [790]

   This, therefore, may be said to be the nearer aim of Christianity--the
   coming of the kingdom of God on earth; but beyond this there is, as
   certainly, another end. Even on earth the kingdom of God does not
   consist supremely, or even peculiarly, in the possession of outward
   good, but in the inward life of the Spirit, in righteousness and peace
   and joy in the Holy Ghost. [791] History, too, moves onward to its
   goal, which is not simply a transformed society, but a winding-up of
   all terrestrial affairs, and the transition from a world of time to a
   new order of things in eternity, in which the good of the kingdom of
   God will be perfectly realised. In dealing with the eschatology proper
   of the Christian view, it will be of advantage to turn our attention
   first to those aspects of it which stand out distinct and clear. I have
   said that a truly purposeful life is only possible on the basis of a
   world-view which has a definite aim. What that aim is in the Christian
   view, as respects its positive and bright side, is seen in the light of
   the Incarnation. There are three points here which seem to stand out
   free from all uncertainty.

   1. The aim of God as regards believers is summed up in the simple
   phrase--conformity to the image of the Son. "Whom He foreknew, He also
   foreordained to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be
   the First-born among many brethren." [792] This is the one absolute
   light-point in the eternal future. The mists and shadows which rest on
   other parts of the eschatological problem do not affect us here. We see
   not yet all things put under humanity, "but we behold Him who hath been
   made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, because of the
   suffering of death crowned with glory and honour," [793] and we know
   that our destiny is to be made like Him. This is conformity to type in
   the highest degree. By what processes the result is to be brought about
   we may not know, but the end itself is clear--the assimilation begun on
   earth shall be perfected above.

   2. This conformity to Christ includes not only moral and spiritual
   likeness to Christ, but likeness to Him also in His glorious body; that
   is, the Redemption of the body, life in a glorified corporeity.
   Difficulties rise here of course in great numbers, and the question
   will be put, "How are the dead raised, and with what manner of body do
   they come?" [794] But, first, I would say that there are certain things
   here also which stand out clear.

   (1) First of all, this doctrine of the Redemption of the body is
   needful for the completion of the Christian view. It is not an
   accident, but an essential and integral part of it. It is essential to
   a complete Redemption, as we saw in speaking of immortality, that not
   the soul only, but man in his whole complex personality, body and soul
   together, should be redeemed. In the disembodied state, the believer
   indeed is with Christ, rests in the blessedness of unbroken fellowship
   with Him, but it is the resurrection which is the perfection of his
   life. [795]

   (2) I say, next, that this doctrine of the Resurrection of the body is
   not exposed to some of the objections often made to it. How, it is
   asked, can the same body be raised, when it is utterly decayed, and the
   particles of which it was composed are scattered to the winds of
   heaven, or perhaps taken up into other bodies? But the doctrine of the
   Resurrection does not involve any such belief. The solution lies, I
   think, in a right conception of what This which constitutes identity.
   Wherein, let us ask, does the identity even of our present bodies
   consist? Not, certainly, in the mere identity of the particles of
   matter of which our bodies are composed, for this is continually
   changing, is in constant process of flux. The principle of identity
   lies rather in that which holds the particles together, which vitally
   organises and constructs them, which impresses on them their form and
   shape, and maintains them in unity with the soul to serve as its
   instrument and medium of expression. It lies, if we may so say, in the
   organic, constructive principle, which in its own nature is spiritual
   and immaterial, and adheres to the side of the soul At death, the body
   perishes. It is resolved into its elements; but this vital, immaterial
   principle endures, prepared, when God wills, to give form to a new and
   grander, because more spiritual, corporeity. The existence of mystery
   here I grant: we cannot understand the resurrection from natural
   causes, but only, as Christ teaches us, from the power of God. [796] It
   is a miracle, and the crowning act of an economy of miracles. But we
   need not make the mystery greater than it is by insisting on a material
   identity between the new body and the old, which is no part of the
   doctrine of Scripture--indeed, is expressly contradicted by the words
   of the apostle, touching on this very point. "Thou foolish one," says
   Paul, "that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened, except it die;
   and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body which shall be,
   but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind; but
   God giveth it a body even as it pleaseth Him, and to each seed a body
   of its own." [797] In the case supposed, we see very clearly, first,
   that the identity consists only in a very minute degree, if at all--and
   then only. accidentally--in identity of material particles; and,
   second, that the real bond lies in the active, vital principle which
   connects the two bodies.

   (3) A third point is, that the resurrection contemplated is not a
   resurrection at death, but a future event connected with the
   consummation of all things. The opposite view is one which has had many
   modern advocates,--among them the authors of The Unseen Universe; [798]
   but, though it professes to stay itself on the expressions, "a house
   not made with hands, eternal in the heavens," "clothed upon with our
   habitation which is from heaven," [799] I do not think that this view
   accords with the general representations of Scripture, which always
   contemplate the resurrection as future, and regard the believer's state
   as, till that time, one of being "unclothed." What Scripture does seem
   to teach is, that meanwhile a preparation for this spiritual body is
   going on, a spiritual basis for it is being laid, through the
   possession and working of Christ's Spirit. [800]

   3. The doctrine of the Christian consummation carries with it, further,
   the idea that, together with the perfecting of the believer, or of the
   sons of God, there will be a perfecting or glorification even of
   outward nature. This is implied in the possession of a corporeity of
   any kind, for that stands in relation to an environment, to a general
   system of things. A new heaven and earth there must be, if there is to
   be glorified corporeity. Scripture, accordingly, makes clear that
   nature also, the creation also, will be delivered from the bondage of
   vanity and corruption under which it is at present held. [801] It is
   needless for us to attempt to anticipate what changes this may imply;
   how it is to be brought about, or how it stands related to the changes
   in the material universe predicted by science. The day alone will
   declare it.

   Connected with these views and anticipations of the consummation, are
   certain pictorial and scenic elements in the Christian eschatology, to
   which attention must now be given. Such are the descriptions of the
   second Advent and of the general Judgement. Here belong the
   eschatological discourses and sayings of Christ and His apostles, in
   regard to which, again, the question is, How are they to be
   interpreted? Taking, first, those which relate to Christ's personal
   return to the world, I might quote Beyschlag as a typical example of
   how these pictorial and scenic elements are treated by many who are
   indisposed to take a literal view of their import. "Jesus," he says,
   "grasps up together in the sensible image of His coming again on the
   clouds of heaven all that which lay beyond His death--the whole
   glorious reversal of His earthly life and the death on the cross, from
   His resurrection on till the perfecting of His kingdom at the last day;
   and the more we keep in view the genuinely prophetic nature of this
   comprehensive sense-image, and how it shares the essential limits of
   all prophecy, the more is a solution found of the at first apparently
   insoluble difficulty of this prophetic part of His doctrine." [802]
   Now, I think a careful study of the passages will compel us to agree
   with this writer on one main point, namely, that Jesus does not always
   speak of His coming in the same sense; that it is to Him rather a
   process in which many elements flow together in a single image, than a
   single definite event, always looked at in the same light. [803] Thus,
   He says to the high priest, with obvious reference to the prophecy in
   Daniel, "Henceforth," that is, from this time on, "ye shall see the Son
   of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of
   heaven." [804] He came again to His disciples after the resurrection;
   lie came in the mission of the Comforter; He came in the power and
   spread of His kingdom, especially after the removal of the limitations
   created by the existing Jewish polity, which seems to be the meaning in
   the passage, "There be some of them that stand here which shall in no
   wise taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in His
   kingdom"; [805] He has come in every great day of the Lord in the
   history of His Church; He will come yet more conspicuously in the
   events of the future. Yet I cannot agree with Beyschlag when, on these
   grounds, he would exclude altogether a final, personal advent of Jesus,
   a visible return in power and glory to the world. It seems to me that
   Christ's words on this subject, repeated by His apostles, are
   altogether too explicit and of too solemn an import to be explained
   away into mere metaphor. I would agree, therefore, with the Church
   catholic in its confession, "From thence He shall come to judge the
   quick and the dead" In Beyschlag's case it seems the more arbitrary to
   deny this, as he fully admits the reality of Christ's resurrection,
   and, if not of His visible ascent, at least of His actual bodily
   reception into heaven. His words are, "What then was the original
   thought of the ascension? What else can it have been than that of the
   elevation of Jesus above the limits of the earthly life, of His
   translation into another, supra-mundane, Divine form of existence--in a
   word, of His exaltation or glorification?" [806] If this be so, there
   is surely no incongruity in the thought that He who thus went away
   shall again appear in manifested glory.

   It is not otherwise with the pictures we have of a final act of
   Judgment as the accompaniment of this reappearance of the Lord. Here,
   also, it is correct to speak of a continuous judgment of the world. The
   history of the world, as we often hear, is the judgment of the world.
   Yet the representations which Christ Himself gives us of a gradual
   ripening of both good and evil to the harvest, then of a final and
   decisive separation [807] --joined with the similar representations of
   the apostles [808] --compel us, it seems to me, to speak of a day of
   reckoning, when God shall judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus;
   which shall be at once a vindication of God's action in the government
   of the world, and a decision upon the issues of the individual life.
   From a teleological view of the world, also, as well as from a survey
   of its existing imperfections, it is felt that there is an inherent
   fitness, if not a moral necessity, in the supposition of such a last
   judgment which shall form, as it were, the denouement of the great
   drama of universal history. [809] It is manifest, on the other hand,
   that all the descriptions and pictures which we have of this dread
   event are so charged with figurative and parabolic elements that we can
   infer nothing from them beyond the great principles on which the
   judgment will proceed.

   III. By these steps we are led up, in the consideration of the last
   things, to that which is for us the question of supreme concern, on
   this subject--the question of individual destiny. I have spoken of this
   already as regards the believer. But what of the shadow alongside of
   the light? What of the judgment of condemnation alongside of the
   judgment of life? What of the wrath of God abiding on the unbeliever,
   alongside of the blessedness of those who are saved? These questions
   are not arbitrarily raised, but are forced upon us by the plain
   statements of Scripture, by the fears and forebodings of the guilty
   conscience, and by the anxiety and perplexity they are causing to many
   hearts. To the questions thus raised, three main answers have been
   given, and are given.

   1. The first is that of dogmatic Universalism. This was the view of
   Origen in the early Church, [810] and is the view of Schleiermacher,
   expressed in the words, "that through the power of Redemption there
   will result in the future a general restoration of all human souls";
   [811] the view expressed yet more dogmatically by Dr. Samuel Cox,
   "While our brethren hold the Redemption of Christ to extend only to the
   life that now is, and to take effect only on some men, we maintain, on
   the contrary, that it extends to the life to come, and must take effect
   on all men at the last"; [812] the view breathed as a wish by
   Tennyson--

     "The wish that of the living whole
     No life may fail beyond the grave." [813]

   It is a view which, I am sure, we would all be glad to hold, if the
   Scriptures gave us light enough to assure us that it was true.

   2. The second answer is that of the theory of Annihilation, or, as it
   is sometimes called, Conditional Immortality. This is the direct
   opposite of the universalistic view, inasmuch as it assumes that the
   wicked will be absolutely destroyed, or put out of existence. Rothe and
   others have held this view among Continental theologians; [814] in this
   country it is best known through the writings of Mr. Edward White. A
   kindred view is that of Bushnell, who, reasoning "from the known
   effects of wicked feeling and practice in the reprobate characters,"
   expects "that the staple of being and capacity in such will be
   gradually diminished, and the possibility is thus suggested that, at
   some remote period, they may be quite wasted away, or extirpated."
   [815] The service which this theory has rendered is as a corrective to
   Universalism, in laying stress on those passages in Scripture which
   appear to teach a final ruin of the wicked.

   3. The third answer is that which has been the prevailing one in the
   Protestant Church, the theory of an eternal punishment of the wicked in
   a state of conscious suffering; a theory, also, with which, in the form
   in which it has been commonly presented, a strong feeling of
   dissatisfaction at present exists. A modification of this theory is
   that which supposes the ultimate fate of the wicked--or of those who
   are the wicked here--to consist in the punishment of loss, rather than
   in that of eternal suffering.

   Such are the views that are held; what attitude are we to. take up
   towards them? I shall best consult my own feelings and sense of duty by
   speaking frankly what I think upon the subject. Here, in the first
   place, I would like to lay down one or two fundamental positions which
   seem to me of the nature of certainties.

   1. I would lay down, as the first and great fundamental certitude, the
   truth enunciated by the prophet, "Say ye of the righteous, that it
   shall be well with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
   Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him; for the reward of his
   hands shall be given him"; [816] in other words, the great and
   fundamental principle of certain retribution for sin. This is a
   principle we cannot hold too clearly or too strongly. Whatever tends to
   tamper with this principle, or to weaken its hold upon the conscience,
   is alien to the true Christian view. By unalterable laws impressed upon
   the nature of man and on the universe, righteousness is life, and sin
   is inevitable misery and death. [817] Omnipotence itself could not
   reverse this law, that so long as the sinner continues in his sin he
   must suffer. On the other hand, where this principle is firmly grasped,
   there ought, I think, to be much room left for difference of views on
   points which, from the nature of the case, are obscure and tentative.

   2. I think, in the next place, a strong distinction ought to be drawn
   between those things which Scripture expressly teaches, and those
   things on which it simply gives no light, in regard to which it neither
   affirms nor denies, but is simply silent. Here our wisdom is to imitate
   its caution, and refrain from dogmatism. I confess I marvel sometimes
   at the confidence with which people pronounce on that which must and
   shall be through the eternities and eternities--the ages and ages--of
   God's unending life, during which also the soul of man is to exist; and
   this in respect of so appalling a subject as the future fate of the
   lost. There is room here for a wise Agnosticism. I prefer to say that,
   so far as my light goes, I see no end, and there to stop.

   3. I hold it for a certainty that, to deal with all the sides and
   relations of this difficult subject, we would require a much larger
   calculus than with our present light we possess. What chiefly weighs
   with many in creating dissatisfaction with the current Church view is
   not so much special texts of Scripture, as rather the general
   impression produced on the mind by the whole spirit and scope of the
   gospel Revelation. Starting with the character of God as Christ reveals
   it; with the fact of the Incarnation; with the reality and breadth of
   the Atonement; with the glimpses given into the issues of Christ's
   work,--the feeling is produced in every thoughtful mind, that the sweep
   of this great scheme of Incarnation and Redemption cannot be exhausted
   in the comparatively meagre results which we see springing from it
   here,--meagre, I mean, in comparison with the whole compass of the race
   or even of those who are brought outwardly within the range of its
   influence. What, men are asking with a constantly heavier sense of the
   burden of the difficulty, of the untold millions who have never heard
   of Christ at all, of the millions and millions who have never even had
   the chance of hearing of Him? What, even within the limits of
   Christendom, of the multitudes, as they must be reckoned, in comparison
   with the really Christ-like in our midst, who give no evidence of true
   regeneration, vast numbers of whom are living openly worldly and
   godless lives? We feel instinctively that the last word has not
   been--cannot be--spoken by us here. It may be said, and with much
   truth, that for -those who have the light, there is no excuse.
   Salvation has been put within their reach, and they have deliberately
   rejected it. But even here, are there not elements we dare not
   overlook? Men are responsible for the use they make of light, but how
   much here also is not due to the individual will, which is crossed by
   influences from heredity, from environment, from up-bringing, from
   pressure of events! God alone can disentangle the threads of freedom in
   the web of character and action, and say how much is a man's individual
   responsibility in the result, as distinguished from his share in the
   common guilt of the race. [818] It is certain, from Christ's own
   statement, that, in the judgment of Omniscience, all these things are
   taken into account, and that even in the administration of punishment
   there are gradations of penalty, proportionate to men s knowledge and
   opportunities; that, as Paul says, there is a distinction made between
   those who have "sinned without law," and those who have "sinned under
   law." [819]

   These principles being laid down, I proceed to offer a few remarks on
   the various theories which have been submitted.

   1. And, first, I cannot accept the view of dogmatic Universalism. There
   is undoubtedly no clear and certain scripture which affirms that all
   men will be saved; on the other hand, there are many passages which
   look in another direction, which seem to put the stamp of finality on
   the sinner's state in eternity. Even Archdeacon Farrar, so strong an
   advocate of this theory, admits that some souls may ultimately be lost;
   [820] and it is to be observed that, if even one soul is lost finally,
   the principle is admitted on which the chief difficulty turns. I am
   convinced that the light and airy assertions one sometimes meets with
   of dogmatic Universalism are not characterised by a due sense of the
   gravity of the evil of sin, or of the awful possibilities of resistance
   to goodness that lie within the human will. It seems to me plain that
   deliberate rejection of Christ here means, at the very least, awful and
   irreparable loss in eternity; that to go from the judgment-seat
   condemned is to exclude oneself in perpetuity from the privilege and
   glory which belong to Gods sons. Even the texts, some of them formerly
   quoted, which at first sight might seem to favour Universalism, are
   admitted by the most impartial expositors not to bear this weight of
   meaning. We read, e.g., of "a restoration of all things"--the same that
   Christ calls the palingenesia--but in the same breath we are told of
   those who will not hearken, and will be destroyed. [821] We read of
   Christ drawing all men unto Him; [822] but we are not less clearly told
   that at His coming Christ will pronounce on some a tremendous
   condemnation. [823] We read of all things being gathered, or summed up,
   in Christ, of Christ subduing all things to Himself, etc.; but
   representative exegetes like Meyer and Weiss show that it is far from
   Paul's view to teach an ultimate conversion or annihilation of the
   kingdom of evil. [824] I confess, however, that the strain of these
   last passages does seem to point in the direction of some ultimate
   unity, be it through subjugation, or in some other way, in which active
   opposition to God's kingdom is no longer to be reckoned with.

   2. Neither can I accept the doctrine of the Annihilation of the Wicked.
   In itself considered, and divested of some of the features with which
   Mr. White clothes it in his Life in Christ, this may be admitted to be
   an abstractly possible hypothesis, and as such has received the assent,
   as before stated, of Rothe and others who are not materialistically
   disposed. There is a certain sense in which everyone will admit that a
   man has not a necessary or inherent immortality, that he depends for
   his continued existence, therefore for his immortality, solely on the
   will and power of God. Man can never rise above the limits of his
   creaturehood. As created, he is, and must remain, a dependent being. It
   is, therefore, a possible supposition--one not a priori to be
   rejected--that though originally made and destined for immortality, man
   might have this destiny cancelled. There is force, too, in what is
   said, that it is difficult to see the utility of keeping a being in
   existence merely to sin and suffer. Yet, when the theory is brought to
   the test of Scripture proof, it is found to fail in evidence.

   (1) Stress is laid on those passages which speak of the destruction of
   the wicked, of their perishing, [825] of their being consumed in fire,
   as chaff, tares, branches, etc. [826] So far as the last class of
   passages is concerned, they are plainly metaphorical, and, iii face of
   other evidence, it is difficult to put on any of them the meaning that
   is asked. For this destruction comes on the ungodly at the day of
   judgment, at the day of the Lord. "Sudden destruction," an apostle
   calls it; [827] yet it is part of this theory that the wicked are not
   annihilated at the day of judgment, but live on in suffering for an
   indefinitely prolonged time, as a punishment for their offences, the
   greatest sinners suffering most. In this respect the theory
   approximates to the ordinary view, for it makes the real punishment of
   the sinner lie in the period of his conscious existence, and the
   annihilation which comes after is rather a merciful termination of his
   sufferings than the crowning of his woe. If Mr. White's theory is to be
   made consistent with itself, it ought to provide for the immediate
   annihilation of the wicked at death, or at least at the judgment. In
   reality, however, the "destruction" comes at the judgment, and the
   "annihilation" not till long after; so that, on his own principles, we
   cannot argue from the mere word to the fact of annihilation.

   (2) Another thing which suggests itself in regard to this theory is
   that, taken strictly, it seems to shut out all gradations of
   punishment; the end of all being "death," i.e. "annihilation." If, to
   escape this, reference is made to the longer or shorter period of the
   suffering before annihilation, this shows, as before, that it is in the
   conscious sufferings, not in the annihilation, that the real punishment
   is supposed to lie.

   (3) But the crowning objection to this theory--so far as proof from
   Scripture is concerned--is that in its use of the words "life" and
   "death," it misses the true significance of these Bible terms. Life is
   not, in Scripture usage, simple existence; death is not simple
   non-existence, but separation from true and complete life. This theory
   itself being witness, the soul survives in the state of natural death.
   It passes into the intermediate condition, and there awaits judgment.
   Life, in short, is, in its Scripture sense, a word with a moral and
   spiritual connotation; a person may not possess it, and yet continue to
   exist. "He that obeyeth not the Son," we are told, "shall not see life,
   but the wrath of God abideth on him." [828] But so long as the wrath of
   God abides (menei) on him, he must abide. So far as Scripture goes,
   therefore, this theory is not proved. It must remain a mere
   speculation, and one which cuts the knot rather than unties it.

   It is interesting to mark that Mr. White himself seems little satisfied
   with his theory, and does his best to relieve it of its harsher
   features. If the thought is terrible of the countless multitudes who
   leave this world without having heard of Christ, or without deliberate
   acceptance of Him, being doomed to endless suffering, it is scarcely
   less appalling to think of these myriads, after longer or shorter terms
   of suffering, being swept from existence by the fiat of Omnipotence.
   Mr. White feels the weight of this difficulty, and tries to alleviate
   it by the thought of a prolonged probation in Hades. [829] Here, he
   thinks, we find the solution of the problem of the heathen; and of many
   more whose opportunities have not been sufficiently great to bring them
   to clear decision. I have no doubt that Mr. White cherishes in his
   heart the hope that by far the greater proportion of mankind will thus
   be saved; that, in consequence, the finally lost will be comparatively
   few. In other words, just as in the admission of prolonged periods of
   penal suffering his theory was seen approximating to that of eternal
   punishment, so here we see it stretching out hands, as it were, on the
   other side, towards "the larger hope" of Universalism. It is certainly
   a curious result that a theory which begins by denying to man any
   natural immortality--which takes away the natural grounds of belief in
   a future state--should end by transferring the great bulk of the
   evangelising and converting work of the gospel over to that future
   state; for, assuredly, what is accomplished there must be immense as
   compared with what, in his view, is done on earth. This brings me--

   3. To speak of the ordinary doctrine, and as a proposed alleviation of
   this, of the theory of a Future Probation, a theory which we have just
   seen is held also by Mr. Edward White. By future probation is meant
   here probation, not after the judgment, but intermediately between
   death and judgment. This is a theory which, as is well known, has found
   wide acceptance among believing theologians on the Continent, and also
   in America, and is advanced by its adherents as a solution of the
   difficulties which arise from supposing that all who leave this world
   without having heard of Christ or having definitely accepted Him
   necessarily perish. It is the theory held, e.g., by Dorner, Van
   Oosterzee, Martensen, Godet, Gretillat, and very many others. No one,
   it is said, will be lost without being brought to a knowledge of
   Christ, and having the opportunity given him of accepting His
   salvation. Every man must be brought to a definite acceptance or
   rejection of Christ, if not here, then hereafter. The theory is
   believed to be supported by the well-known passages in the First
   Epistle of Peter which speak of a preaching by Christ to the spirits in
   prison, and of the gospel being preached to the dead. [830]

   Yet, when all is said, this theory must be admitted to be based more on
   general principles than on definite scriptural information. Our own
   Church is not committed on the subject; indeed, as I have occasion to
   remember, in framing its Declaratory Act, it expressly rejected an
   amendment designed to bind it to the position that probation in every
   case is limited to time. The Synod acted wisely, I think, in rejecting
   that amendment. All the same, I wish now to say that I do not much like
   this phrase, "Future Probation." Least of all am I disposed with some
   to make a dogma of it. There are three facts in regard to the
   scriptural aspect of this theory which ought, I think, to make us
   cautious.

   (1) The first is the intense concentration of every ray of exhortation
   and appeal into the present. "Now is the acceptable time; behold, now
   is the day of salvation." [831] This is the strain of Scripture
   throughout. Everything which would weaken the force of this appeal, or
   lead men to throw over into a possible future what ought to be done
   now, is a distinct evil.

   (2) The second is the fact that, in Scripture, judgment is invariably
   represented as proceeding on the matter of this life, on The "deeds
   done in the body." [832] The state after death is expressly described,
   in contrast with the present life, as one of "judgment." [833] In every
   description of the judgment, or allusion to it, it is constantly what a
   man has been, or has done, in this life, which is represented as the
   basis on which the determination of his final state depends. There is
   not a word, or hint, to indicate that a man who would be found on the
   left hand of the King, or who would pass under condemnation, on the
   basis of his earthly record, may possibly be found on the other side,
   and be accepted, on the ground of some transaction in the state between
   death and judgment. Surely this does not agree well with a "future
   probation" theory, but would rather require us to suppose that, in
   principle at least, man is presumed to decide his destiny here.

   (3) There is, as the converse of these facts, the silence of Scripture
   on the subject of probation beyond; for the passages in 1 Peter, even
   accepting the interpretation which makes them refer to a work of Christ
   in the state of the dead, form surely a slender foundation on which to
   build so vast a structure. The suggestions they offer are not to be
   neglected. But neither do they speak of general probation, if of
   probation at all; nor give information as to the special character of
   this preaching to the dead, or its results in conversion; least of all
   do they show that what may apply to the heathen or others similarly
   situated, applies to those whose opportunities have been ample. I have
   spoken of the influences of heredity, etc., as an element to be taken
   account of in judgment; but we must beware, even here, of forgetting
   how much responsibility remains. Will is at work here also; personal
   volition is interweaving itself with the warp of natural circumstance
   and of hereditary predisposition. In the sphere of heathenism
   itself--even apart from the direct preaching of the gospel--there is
   room for moral decision wider than is sometimes apprehended, and a type
   of will is being formed on which eternal issues may depend.

   I recognise, however, in the light of what I have stated about the need
   of a larger calculus, that the issues of this life must prolong
   themselves into the unseen, and, in some way unknown to us, be brought
   to a bearing there. All I plead for is, that we should not set up a
   definite theory where, in the nature of things, we have not the light
   to enable us to do so. This again is a reason for refusing to acquiesce
   in many of the dogmatic affirmations which are advanced in the name of
   a doctrine of eternal punishment. Suffering and loss beyond expression
   I cannot but conceive of as following from definite rejection of
   Christ; nor do I see anything in Scripture to lead me to believe that
   this loss can ever be repaired. How this will relate itself to
   conditions of existence in eternity I do not know, and beyond this I
   decline to speculate.

   The conclusion I arrive at is, that we have not the elements of a
   complete solution, and we ought not to attempt it. What visions beyond
   there may he, what larger hopes, what ultimate harmonies, if such there
   are in store, will come in God's good time; it is not ours to
   anticipate them, or lift the veil where God has left it drawn! What
   Scripture wishes us to realise is the fact of probation now, of
   responsibility here. We should keep this in view, and, concentrating
   all our exhortations and entreaty into the present, should refuse to
   sanction hopes which Scripture does not support; striving, rather, to
   bring men to live under the impression, "How shall. we escape, if we
   neglect so great salvation?" (Heb. ii. 3).

   Here I bring these Lectures to a conclusion. No one is more conscious
   than myself of the imperfection of the outlines I have sought to trace;
   of the thoughts I have brought before you in the wide and important
   field over which we have had to travel. Only, in a closing word, would
   I. state the deepened, strengthened conviction which has come to myself
   out of the study, often prolonged and anxious enough, which the duties
   of this Lectureship have entailed on me: the deepened and strengthened
   conviction of the reality and certainty of God's supernatural
   Revelation to the world,--of His great purpose of love and grace,
   centring in the manifestation of His Son, but stretching out in its
   issues through all worlds, and into all eternities,--of a Redemption
   adequate to human sin and need, the blessings of which it is our
   highest privilege to share, and to make known to others. With this has
   gone the feeling--one of thankfulness and hope--of the breadth of the
   range of the influence of this new power which has gone out from
   Christ: not confined, as we might be apt to think, to those who make
   the full confession of His name, but touching society, and the world of
   modern thought and action, on all its sides--influencing its life and
   moulding its ideals; and in circles where the truth, as we conceive it,
   is mutilated, and even in important parts eclipsed, begetting a
   personal devotion to Christ, a recognition of His unique and peerless
   position in history, and a faith in the spread and ultimate triumph of
   His kingdom, which is full of significance and comfort. I hail these
   omens; this widespread influence of the name of Jesus. It tells us
   that, despite of appearances which seem adverse, there is a true
   kingdom of God on earth, and that a day of gathering up in Christ Jesus
   is yet to come. I do not believe that the modern world has ceased to
   need the Christian view, or that in spirit its back is turned against
   it. The "isms" of the day are numerous, and the denials from many
   quarters are fierce and vehement. But in the very unbelief of the time
   there is a serious feeling such as never existed before; and there is
   not one of these systems but, with all its negations, has its side of
   light turned towards Christ and His religion. Christ is the centre
   towards which their broken lights converge, and, as lifted up, He will
   yet draw them unto Him. I do not, therefore, believe that the Christian
   view is obsolete; that it is doomed to go down like a faded
   constellation in the west of the sky of humanity. I do not believe
   that, in order to preserve it, one single truth we have been accustomed
   to see shining in that constellation will require to be withdrawn, or
   that the world at heart desires it to he withdrawn. The world needs
   them all, and will one day acknowledge it. It is not with a sense of
   failure, therefore, but with a sense of triumph, that I see the
   progress of the battle between faith and unbelief. I have no fear that
   the conflict will issue in defeat. Like the ark above the waters,
   Christ's religion will ride in safety the waves of present-day
   unbelief, as it has ridden the waves of unbelief in days gone by,
   bearing in it the hopes of the future of humanity.

   I thank the Principal and Professors, I thank the students, for their
   unfailing courtesy, and for their generous reception of myself and of
   my Lectures.

   realisation of their low position, in seeing themselves at length as
   they really are, in feeling that all their work is yet to do, in
   beholding all those they loved and venerated far before them, away from
   them, fading in the bright distance, may lie, must lie, a torture, a

   display of it in feeling and will means, it must appear a gross

APPENDIX.

THE IDEA OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD.

   In the original plan of these Lectures it was my intention to include a
   Lecture on "The Incarnation and the New Life of Humanity; the Kingdom
   of God," which would have found its fitting place between the eighth
   and what is now the ninth. Such a Lecture is obviously needed to
   complete the course. After resurrection came exaltation. After Calvary
   came Pentecost. After the ministry of the Son came the dispensation of
   the Spirit. The new life proceeding from Christ, entering first as a
   regenerating principle into the individual soul, was gradually to
   permeate and transform society. The doctrine of Redemption passes over
   into that of the kingdom of God. This design has reluctantly had to he
   abandoned, and all I can here attempt, in addition to the brief
   allusions in Lecture Ninth, is to give a few notes on the general idea
   of the kingdom of God.

   I. I shall refer first to the place of this idea in recent theology.

   This idea has had a prominence accorded to it in recent theology it
   never possessed before, and the most thoroughgoing attempts are made to
   give it application in both dogmatics and ethics. By making it the
   head-notion in theology, and endeavouring to deduce all particular
   conceptions from it, it is thought that we place ourselves most in
   Christ's own point of view, and keep most nearly to His own lines of
   teaching. Kant here, as in so many other departments, may be named as
   the forerunner; and fruitful suggestions may be gleaned from writers
   like Schleiermacher, Schmid, and Beck. It is the school of Ritschl,
   however, which has done most to carry out consistently this all-ruling
   notion of the kingdom of God, making it the determinative conception
   even in our ideas of sin, of the Person of Christ, etc. Through their
   influence it has penetrated widely and deeply into current theological
   thought, and is creating for itself quite an extensive literature.
   [834]

   This being the prevailing tendency, I may not unnaturally be blamed for
   not making more use of this idea than I have done in these Lectures. If
   this is the chief and all-embracing, the all-comprehensive and
   all-inclusive notion of the pure Christian view, it may be felt that
   the attempt to develop the Christian "Weltanschauung," without explicit
   reference to it, is bound to be a failure. I may reply that I have not
   altogether left it out; it is, indeed, the conception I should have
   wished to develop further, as best fitted to convey my idea of the goal
   of the Christian Redemption, and of the great purpose of God of which
   that is the expression. But I have another reason. It is, that I
   gravely doubt the possibility or desirability of making this the
   all-embracing, all-dominating conception of Christian theology, except,
   of course, as the conception of an end affects and determines all that
   leads up to it. And even here the idea of the kingdom of God is not the
   only or perfectly exhaustive conception. The following reasons may be
   given for this opinion:--

   1. The kingdom of God is not so presented in the New Testament. In the
   preaching of Christ in the Synoptic Gospels, this idea has indeed a
   large place. Christ attaches Himself in this way to the hopes of His
   nation, and to the doctrine of the prophets. Yet the very variety of
   the aspects of His doctrine of the kingdom shows how difficult it must
   be to sum them all up permanently under this single formula. In the
   Gospel of John, the idea is not so prominent, but recedes behind that
   of "life." In the Epistles, it goes still more decidedly into the
   background. Instead of the kingdom, it is Christ Himself who is new
   made prominent, and becomes the centre of interest. Harnack notices
   this in his Dogmengeschichte. "It is not wonderful," he says, "that in
   the oldest Christian preaching Jesus Christ' meets us as frequently as
   in the preaching of Jesus the kingdom of God itself." [835] In 1 Peter
   the expression is not found; in James only once. The Pauline theology
   is developed from its own basis, without any attempt to make it fit
   into this conception. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, it is other ideas
   that rule. Where this idea is used in the Epistles, it is generally
   with an eschatological reference. [836] The Apocalypse is the book of
   the New Testament which gives it most prominence.

   2. The kingdom of God is not a notion which can be treated as a fixed
   quantity. The greatest possible diversity prevails among the
   interpreters as to what ideas are to be attached to this expression.
   Whether the kingdom of God is something set up in this life (Ritschl,
   Wendt, etc.), or is something which has reference only to the future
   (Kaftan, Schmoller, J. Weiss, etc.); whether it is to be taken in a
   purely ethical and religious sense (Ritschl, etc.), or is to he
   extended to embrace all the relations of existence--the family, state,
   art, culture, etc. (Schleiermacher, Beck, etc.); what is the nature of
   the good which it promises--these and numberless other points are still
   keenly under discussion. This is not a reason for saying that on
   Christ's lips the term has no definite signification, but it shows that
   the time is not yet ripe for making it the one and all-inclusive notion
   in theology.

   3. Even when we have reached what seems a satisfactory conception of
   the kingdom, it will be found difficult in practice to bring all the
   parts and subjects of theology under it. In proof of this, appeal might
   be made to the work of those who have adopted this as their principle
   of treatment. [837] The older Nitzsch, in his System of Doctrine, says
   of a writer (Theremin) who maintained the possibility of such a
   deduction, that if he had really applied his general notion of the
   kingdom of God to a partition and articulation of the Christian
   doctrinal system, it would have become manifest of itself that this was
   not the right middle notion to bind the parts together. Schleiermacher,
   and Beck, and Lipsius, alike fail to carry through this idea in their
   systems. Either the doctrines are viewed only in this relation, in
   which case many aspects are overlooked which belong to a full system of
   theology; or a mass of material is taken in which is only connected
   with this idea in the loosest way. The idea of the kingdom of God
   becomes in this way little more than a formal scheme or groundwork into
   which the ordinary material of theology is fitted. Ritschl, indeed,
   renounces the idea of a perfect unity, when he says that Christianity
   is an ellipse with two foci --one the idea of the kingdom of God, the
   other the idea of Redemption. [838]

   4. The true place of the idea of the kingdom of God in theology is as a
   teleological conception. It defines the aim and purpose of God in
   creation and Redemption. It is the highest aim, but everything else in
   the plan and purpose of God cannot be deduced from it. Even as end, we
   must distinguish between the aim of God to establish a kingdom of God
   on earth and the ultimate end--the unity of all things natural and
   spiritual in Christ. The fulness of this last conception is not
   exhausted in the one idea of "kingdom," though this certainly touches
   the central and essential fact, that God is "all in all." [839]

   II. Let us next consider the teaching of Jesus on the kingdom of God.
   Here,

   1. I cannot but agree with those who think that the kingdom of God, in
   Christ's view, is a present, developing reality. [840] This is implied
   in the parables of growth (mustard seed, leaven, seed growing
   secretly); in the representations of it, in its earthly form, as a
   mixture of good and bad (wheat and tares, the net of fishes); in the
   description of the righteousness of the kingdom (Sermon on the Mount),
   which is to be realised in the ordinary human relations; as well as in
   many special sayings. I do not see how anyone can read these passages
   and doubt that in Christ's view the kingdom was a presently-existing,
   slowly developing reality, [841] originating in His word, containing
   mixed elements, and bound in its development to a definite law of
   rhythm ("first the blade, then the ear," etc.). [842] On the other
   hand, the idea has an eschatological reference. The kingdom is not
   something which humanity produces by its own efforts, but something
   which comes to it from above. It is the entrance into humanity of a new
   life from heaven. In its origin, its power; its blessings, its aims,
   its end, it is supernatural and heavenly. Hence it is the kingdom of
   heaven, and two stadia are distinguished in its existence--an earthly
   and an eternal; the latter being the aspect that chiefly prevails in
   the Epistles. [843]

   2. What is the nature of this kingdom of God on earth? In the Lecture,
   I have spoken of it as a new principle introduced into society which is
   fitted and destined to transform it in all its relations. This is the
   view of Schleiermacher, Neander, [844] Beck, of Dorner, Martensen,
   Harless, in their works on "Christian Ethics," and of most Protestant
   writers. This view, however, is contested, and has to be considered.

   (1) Now, first, it is to be acknowledged that in Christ's teaching it
   is the spiritual, or directly religious and ethical, side of the
   kingdom which alone is made prominent. Those who would identify the
   kingdom off-hand with social aims and endeavours, such as we know them
   in the nineteenth century, look in vain in Christ's teaching for their
   warrant. There the whole weight is rested on the inward disposition, on
   the new relation to God, on the new life of the Spirit, on the new
   righteousness proceeding from that life, on the new hopes and
   privileges of the sons of God. Everything is looked at in the light of
   the spiritual, the eternal. We read nothing in Christ of the effects of
   His religion on art, on culture, on philosophy, on politics, on
   commerce, on education, on science, on literature, on economical or
   social reform. It is the same with the apostles. Absorbed in the
   immediate work of men's salvation, they do not look at, or speak of,
   its remoter social effects. How far this is due in their case to the
   absence of apprehension of a long period of development of Christ's
   religion, and to a belief on the impending dissolution of the world, I
   need not here discuss. [845] The fact remains that, as already stated,
   while regarding the believer as already in God's kingdom and partaker
   of its blessings, their conceptions of the kingdom, in its actual
   manifestation, are mainly eschatological.

   (2) But, second, as it is certain that a principle of this kind could
   not enter into society without profoundly affecting it in all its
   relations, so we may be sure that Christ did not leave this aspect of
   it out of account. And when we look a little deeper, we see that
   Christ, though He does not lay stress on this side, yet by no means
   excludes it, but, on the contrary, presupposes and assumes it in His
   teaching. It is to be observed:

   (a) Christ, in His teaching, presupposes the truth of the Old
   Testament, and moves in the circle of its conceptions. The Old
   Testament moves predominatingly in the religious and ethical sphere
   too, but there is a large material background or framework. We have
   accounts of the creation, of the early history of man, of his vocation
   to replenish the earth and subdue it, of the first institutions of
   society, of the beginnings of civilisation, of the divisions of
   nations, etc. Christ never leaves this Old Testament ground. The world
   to Him is God's world, and not the devil's. He has the deepest feeling
   for its beauty, its sacredness, the interest of God in the humblest of
   His creatures; His parables are drawn from its laws; He recognises that
   its institutions are the expression of a Divine order. The worlds of
   nature and society, therefore, in all the wealth and fulness of their
   relations, are always the background of His picture. We see this in His
   parables, which have nothing narrow and ascetic about them, hut mirror
   the life of humanity in it amplest breadth--the sower, shepherd,
   merchant, handicraftsman, the servants with their talents (and proving
   faithful and unfaithful in the use of them), the builder, the
   vineyard-keeper, weddings, royal feasts, etc.

   (b) The world, indeed, in its existing form, Christ cannot recognise as
   belonging to His kingdom. Rather, it is a hostile power--"the world,"
   in the bad sense. His disciples are to expect hatred and persecution in
   it. It is under the dominion of Satan, "the prince of this world."
   [846] His kingdom will only come through a long succession of wars,
   crises, sorrows, and terrible tribulations. Yet there is nothing
   Manichaean, or dualistic, in Christ's way of conceiving of this
   presence of evil in the world. If man is evil, he is still capable of
   Redemption; and what is true of the individual is true of society. His
   kingdom is a new power entering into it for the purpose of its
   transformation, and is regarded as a growing power in it.

   (c) Christ, accordingly, gives us many indications of His true view of
   the relation of His kingdom to society. The world is His Father's, and
   human paternity is but a lower reflection of the Divine Fatherhood.
   Marriage is a Divine institution, to be jealously guarded, and Christ
   consecrated it by His special presence and blessing. The State also is
   a Divine ordinance, and tribute is due to its authority. [847] The
   principles He lays down in regard to the use and perils of wealth; love
   to our neighbour in his helplessness and misery; the care of the poor;
   the infinite value of the soul, etc., introduce new ideals, and involve
   principles fitted to transform the whole social system. His miracles of
   healing show His care for the body. With this correspond His
   injunctions to His disciples. He does not pray that they may be taken
   out of the world, but only that they may be kept from its evil. [848]
   They are rather to live in the world, showing by their good works that
   they are the sons of their Father in heaven; are to be the light of the
   world, and the salt of the earth. [849] Out of this life in the world
   will spring a new type of marriage relation, of family life, of
   relation between masters and servants, of social existence generally.
   It cannot be otherwise, if Christ's kingdom is to be the leaven He says
   it shall be. The apostles, in their views on all these subjects, are in
   entire accord with Christ. [850]

   (3) We may glance at a remaining point, the relation of the idea of the
   kingdom of God to that of the Church. If our previous exposition is
   correct, these ideas are not quite identical, as they have frequently
   been taken to be. The kingdom of God is a wider conception than that of
   the Church. On the other hand, these ideas do not stand so far apart as
   they are sometimes represented. In some cases, as, e.g., in Matt.
   xviii. 18, 19, the phrase "kingdom of heaven" is practically synonymous
   with the Church. The Church is, as a society, the visible expression of
   this kingdom in the world; is, indeed, the only society which does
   formally profess (very imperfectly often) to represent it. Yet the
   Church is not the outward embodiment of this kingdom in all its
   aspects, but only in its directly religious and ethical, i.e. in its
   purely spiritual aspect. It is not the direct business of the Church,
   e.g., to take to do with art, science, politics, general literature,
   etc., but to bear witness for God and His truth to men, to preach and
   spread the gospel of the kingdom, to maintain God's worship, to
   administer the sacraments, to provide for the self-edification and
   religious fellowship of believers. Yet the Church has a side turned
   towards all these other matters, especially to all efforts for the
   social good and bettering of mankind, and cannot but interest herself
   in these efforts, and lend what aid to them she can. She has her
   protest to utter against social injustice and immorality; her witness
   to bear to the principles of conduct which ought to guide individuals
   and nations in the various departments of their existence; her help to
   bring to the solution of the questions which spring up in connection
   with capital and labour, rich and poor, rulers and subjects; her
   influence to throw into the scale on behalf of "whatsoever things are
   true, whatsoever things are honourable, whatsoever things are just,
   whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
   things are of good report" (Phil. iv. 8). A wholesome tone in
   literature, a Christian spirit in art and science, a healthy temper in
   amusements, wise and beneficent legislation on Christian principles in
   the councils of the nation, the spirit of long-suffering, peace,
   forbearance, and generosity, brought into the relations of men with one
   another in society, Christian ideals in the relations of nations to one
   another, self-sacrificing labours for the amelioration and elevation of
   the condition of the masses of the people,--these are matters in which
   the Church can never but be interested. Else she foregoes her calling,
   and may speedily expect to be removed out of her place.

   III. Historically, we might have looked, had space permitted, at this
   kingdom of God as the principle of a new life to humanity. I do not
   enter into this extensive field, but only remark:

   1. The principle of this new life is Christ risen and exalted. It was
   not by His preaching merely that Christ came to set up the kingdom of
   God. The foundation of it was laid, not only in His Word, but in His
   redeeming acts--in His death, His resurrection, His exaltation to
   heaven, His sending of the Spirit. The new kingdom may be said to have
   begun its formal existence on the day of Pentecost. This is the mistake
   of those who would have us confine our ideas of the kingdom solely to
   what is given in the records of Christ's earthly life--they would have
   us go behind Pentecost, and remain there. But Christ's teaching on
   earth could not anticipate, much less realise, what His death, and the
   gift of His Spirit, have given us. It is not Christ's earthly life, but
   His risen life, which is the principle of quickening to His Church.
   [851] He himself bade His disciples wait for the coming of the Spirit;
   and told them that it was through His being "lifted up" that the world
   would be brought to Him. The Spirit would complete His mission; supply
   what was lacking in His teaching; bring to remembrance what He had said
   to them; and would work as a power convincing of sin, of righteousness,
   and of judgment in the world. [852]

   2. This new life in humanity is (1) a new life in the individual, a
   regeneration of the individual soul, a power of sanctification and
   transformation in the nature. But (2) it is further, as we have seen, a
   principle of new life in society, exercising there a transforming
   influence. What society owes to the religion of Christ, even in a
   temporal and social respect, it is beyond the power of man to tell. It
   is this that enables us, from the Christian standpoint, to take an
   interest in all labours for the social good of men, whether they
   directly bear the Christian name or not. The influence of Christ and
   His ideals is more apparent in them than their promoters sometimes
   think. They are not without relation to the progress of the kingdom.

   3. The kingdom of God, being the end, is also the centre, i.e. it is
   with ultimate reference to it that we are to read, and are best able to
   appreciate, the great movements of Providence. We can already see how
   the progress of invention and discovery, of learning and science, of
   facilities of communication and interconnection of nations, has aided
   in manifold ways the advance of the kingdom of God. It has often been
   remarked how the early spread of Christianity was facilitated by the
   political unity of the Roman Empire, and the prevalence of the Greek
   tongue; and how much the revival of learning, the invention of
   printing, and the enlargement of men's ideas by discovery, did to
   prepare the way for the sixteenth century Reformation. In our own
   century the world is opened up as never before, and the means of a
   rapid spread of the gospel are put within our power, if the Church has
   only faithfulness to use them. It is difficult to avoid the belief that
   the singular development of conditions in this century, its unexampled
   progress in discovery and in the practical mastery of nature, the
   marvellous opening up of the world which has been the result, and the
   extraordinary multiplication of the means and agencies of rapid
   communication, together portend some striking development of the
   kingdom of God which shall cast all others into the shade,--a crisis,
   perhaps, which shall have the most profound effect upon the future of
   humanity. [853] The call is going forth again, "Prepare ye in the
   wilderness the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway
   for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill
   shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the
   rough places plain; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and
   all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
   it" [854]

   [834] Recent works in our own country are Professor Candlish's The
   Kingdom of God (Cunningham Lectures, 1884), and Professor A. B. Bruce's
   The Kingdom of God (1889). A good discussion of the subject is
   contained in an article by D. J. Kostlin, in the Studien und Kritiken
   for 1892 (3rd part). I may mention also Schmoller's recent work, Die
   Lehre vom Reiche Gottes in den Schriften des Neuen Testaments (1891);
   another by E. Issel on the same subject (1891); and a revolutionary
   essay by J. Weiss, entitled Die Predigt Jesu vom Reiche Gottes (1892).

   [835] Vol. i. p. 79. Kaftan similarly remarks: "In Paul also the
   doctrine of the highest good is determined through faith in the risen
   and exalted Christ who had appeared to him before the gates of
   Damascus. It can indeed be said that the glorified Christ here fills
   the place taken in the preaching of Jesus by the super-terrestrial
   kingdom of God, which has appeared in His Person, and through Him is
   made accessible as a possession to His disciples."--Das Wesen, p. 229.

   [836] Not always, however; e.g. Rom. xiv. 17. Besides, what Christ
   meant by the present being of His kingdom is always recognised by these
   writers.

   [842] The kingdom of God, in its simplest definition, is the reign of
   God in human hearts and in society; and as such it may be viewed under
   two aspects: (1) the reign or dominion of God Himself; (2) the sphere
   of this dominion. This sphere, again, may be (1) the individual soul;
   (2) the totality of such souls (the Church invisible); (3) the visible
   society of believers (the Church); (4) humanity in the whole complex of
   its relations, so far as this is brought under the influence of God's
   Spirit and of the principles of His religion. It is obvious--and this
   is one source of the difficulty in coming to a common
   understanding--that Christ does not always use this expression in the
   same sense, or with the same breadth of signification. Sometimes one
   aspect, sometimes another, of His rich complex idea is intended by this
   term. Sometimes the kingdom of God is a power within the soul of the
   individual; sometimes it is a leaven in the world, working for its
   spiritual transformation; sometimes it is the mixed visible society;
   sometimes it is that society under its ideal aspect; sometimes it is
   the totality of its blessings and powers (the chief good); sometimes it
   is the future kingdom of God in its heavenly glory and perfection. The
   view that Christ looked for a long and slow process of development and
   ripening in His kingdom may seem to be opposed by the eschatological
   predictions in Matt. xxiv. Even here, however, it is possible to
   distinguish a nearer and a remoter horizon--the one, referring to the
   destruction of Jerusalem and the dissolution of the Jewish state, and
   demoted by the expression, "these things" ("this generation shall not
   pass away, till all these things he accomplished," ver. 34); and the
   other, denoted by the words, "that day and hour" (ver. 36), regarding
   which Christ says, "Of that day and hour knoweth no one, not even the
   angels of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only."

   [843] The eschatological view alone is that taken by Kaftan, Schmoller,
   J. Weiss, etc.

   [844] See History of the Church, opening paragraphs.

   [845] Paul's large view of the philosophy of history in Rom. xi., of a
   future "fulness of the Gentiles," etc., is against this supposition. It
   is too hastily assumed that the Apostle looked for the Lord's return in
   his own lifetime.--See note by Professor Marcus feds on 1 Thess. iv. 15
   in Schaff's Popular Commentary on the New Testament.

   [846] John xii. 31, xv. 11, etc.

   [851] "In truth the life of the soul hidden with Christ in God is the
   kernel of the Christian religion."--Kaftan, Das Wesen, p. 76. Kaftan
   has here the advantage over Ritschl, Schleiermacher, etc.

   [852] John xii. 32, xiv. 26, xv. 7-15.

   [853] It is curious how this feeling of an impending crisis sometimes
   finds expression in minds not given to apocalyptic reveries. Lord
   Beaconsfield said in 1874: "The great crisis of the world is nearer
   than some suppose." In a recent number of the Forum, Professor Goldwin
   Smith remarks: "There is a general feeling abroad that the stream of
   history is drawing near a climax now; and there are apparent grounds
   for the surmise. There is everywhere in the social frame an untoward
   unrest, which is usually a sign of fundamental change within."

LECTURE I NOTE A.--P. 3.

  THE IDEA ON THE "WELTANSCHAUUNG."

   The history of this term has yet to be written. I do not know that Kant
   uses it, or the equivalent term "Weltansicht," at all--it is at least
   not common with him. The same is true of Fichte, Schelling, and
   generally of writers till after the middle of this century. [855] Yet
   Kant above all gave the impulse to its use, both by his theoretic
   "Idea" of the world, and by his practical philosophy, which results in
   a "Weltanschauung" under the idea of the moral. Hegel, however, has the
   word, e.g., "As man, religion is essential to him, and not a strange
   experience. Still the question arises as to the relation of religion to
   the rest of his Weltanschauung,' and philosophical knowledge relates
   itself to this subject, and has to do essentially with
   it."--Religionsphilosophie, i. p. 7. Within the last two or three
   decades the word has become exceedingly common in all kinds of books
   dealing with the higher questions of religion and philosophy--so much
   so as to have become in a manner indispensable. Thus we read of the
   "Theistic," "Atheistic, "Pantheistic," "Realistic," "Materialistic,
   "Mechanistic," "Buddhistic," "Kantian" Weltanschauungen; and a
   multitude of similar phrases might be cited.

   The best special contribution to the discussion of the idea I have met
   with is in a book entitled Die Weltanschauung des Christenthums, by
   August Baur (1881), which I regret I did not come across till my own
   work was finished. [856] In this work the author expresses his surprise
   that more has not been done for the elucidation of a term which has
   become one of the favourite terms of the day; and alludes to the
   absence of any explanation of it (a fact which had struck myself) in
   books professedly dealing with the terminology of philosophy and
   theology, as, e.g., Rud. Eucken's Geschichte und Kritik der
   Grundbegriffe der Gegenwart (1878), and Geschichte der philosophischen
   Terminologie (1879). [857] The same writer has contributed an article
   on "The Notion and Ground-plan of the Weltanschauung' generally, and of
   the Christian in particular," to the Jahrbucher d. prot. Theologie,
   vol. iii. A valuable examination of the subject is contained also in an
   able work published in 1887, Das menschliche Erkennen, Grundlinien der
   Erkenntnisstheorie und Metaphysik, by Dr. A. Dorner. I might further
   refer to Hartmann's Religionsphilosophie, Zweiter Theil: Die Religion
   des Geistes, which, on this particular subject, contains a good deal of
   most suggestive matter (pp. 1-55). As may be gathered from the remarks
   in the close of the Lecture, the idea has a large place in the writings
   of the Ritschlian school. It is discussed with special fulness and care
   in Herrmann's Die Religion im VerhÃ¤ltniss zum Welterkennen und zur
   Sittlichkeit, the last section of which bears the heading, "The Task of
   the Dogmatic Proof of the Christian Weltanschauung.'" Lipsius also
   devotes considerable attention to it in the first part of his Dogmatik
   (sects. 16-115).

   It is characteristic of the Ritschlian school that it will allow no
   origin for the "Weltanschauung" but that which springs from religion or
   morality. Ritschl, e.g., traces the tendency to the formation of
   general views of the world solely to the religious impulse. Philosophy
   also, he says, "raises the claim to produce in its own way a view of
   the world as a whole; but in this there betrays itself much more an
   impulse of a religious kind, which philosophers must distinguish from
   their method of knowledge."--Die christ. Lehre von der Rechtfertigung
   und Versohnung, iii. p. 197 (3rd ed.). This is connected with his view
   that religion itself originates in the need which man feels of help
   from a supernatural power to enable him to maintain his personality
   against the limitations and hindrances of natural existence. [858]
   Since, however, he allows that philosophy has as part of its task "the
   aim of comprehending the world-whole in a highest law," and that "the
   thought of God which pertains to religion is also employed in some form
   in every philosophy which is not materialistic" (p. 194), what he
   really contends for would seem to amount to no more than this, that
   theoretic knowledge alone cannot attain to that highest view of God
   which is given in the Christian religion, and which is necessary for
   the completion of a after satisfactory view of the universe as a whole.
   [859] The truth is, Ritschl's views vary very widely on these topics in
   the different editions of his chief work, and it is no easy task to
   reduce his statements to unity.

   In quite a similar spirit to Ritschl, his disciples Herrmann and Kaftan
   conceive of the "Weltanschauung" as due only to the operation of the
   practical or religious motive. [860] The peculiarity of the Christian
   "Weltanschauung" Kaftan sums up in the two positions--"that the world
   is perfectly dependent on God, and that He orders everything in it in
   conformity with the end of His holy love." [861]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [855] But Fitche has the equivalent "Ansicht der Welt," and
   occasionally "Weltansicht." See especially his Die Anweisung zum
   seligen Leben (1806), Lect. V. "Weltansicht" is Schopenhauer's word.

   [856] The headings of the chapters of Baur's book will suffice to show
   its importance for our subject. They are--

   1. The general notion of the "Weltanschauung."

   2. Characterisation and criticism of the objections of the modern
   spirit against religion and the religious "Weltanschauung."

   3. Possibility and necessity of an ideal, supersensible
   "Weltanschauung."

   4. The supersensible, ideal "Weltanschauung" according to its essence,
   and us its transition to the religious "Weltanschauung" generally.

   5. The "Weltanschauung" of Christianity.
   In theology A. Baur is a follower of Alex. Schweizer, of whom a good
   notice may be seen in Pfleiderer's Development of Theology, pp.
   125-130.

   [857] Eucken himself, however, uses it, as when be says, "Bohme strives
   after an expression for the notion of consciousness and
   self-consciousness, which has a central place within his
   "Weltanschauung" (Gesch. der phil. Term. p. 128); and has recently
   published an admirable historical and critical work, bearing the
   kindred title, Die Lebensanschauungen Denker (1890). This work contains
   a valuable section on "Die christliche Welt and die Lebensanschauungen
   Jesu" (pp. 154-205).

   [858] Cf. Recht. und Ver. iii. p. 189.

   [859] Ritschl's own words, with which we heartily agree, are: "If
   theoretical thought is ever to solve the problem of the world as a
   whole, it will have to fall back on the Christian view of God, of the
   world, and of human destiny" (2nd ed. p. 210).

   [860] With the Ritschlian theologians religion and morality sustain
   only an external relation to each other. The deepest impulse is not
   religion, but self-maintenance (Herrmann), or self-satisfaction
   (Kaftan). Religion is but means to this end.

LECTURE I NOTE B.--P. 5.

  CLASSIFICATION ON "WELTANSCHAUUNGEN."

   It is not easy to find a principle of division which will yield a
   perfectly satisfactory classification of systems which we yet readily
   recognise as presenting distinct types of world-view. The deepest
   ground of division, undoubtedly, is that which divides systems
   according as they do or do not recognise a spiritual principle at the
   basis of the universe. But when, by the aid of this principle, we have
   put certain systems on the one side, and certain systems on the other,
   it does not carry us much further. We must, therefore, either content
   ourselves with a simple catalogue, or try some other method. In the
   earliest attempts at a world-view many elements are mixed up
   together--religious, rational, and ethical impulses, poetic
   personification of nature, the mythological tendency, etc., and
   classification is impossible. The "Weltanschauung" at this stage is
   rude, tentative, imperfect, and goes little further than seeking an
   origin of some kind for the existing state of things, and connecting
   the different parts of nature and of human life in some definite way
   with particular gods. The interest felt in the soul and its fates
   enlarge this "Weltanschauung" to embrace a world of the unseen (Sheol,
   Amenti, etc.). Of reflective "Weltanschauungen," as these appear in
   history, we may roughly distinguish--

   I. The Phenomenalistic and Agnostic--which refuse all inquiry into
   causes, and would confine themselves strictly to the laws of phenomena.
   The only pure type of this class which I know is the Comtist or
   Positivist, which contents itself with a subjective synthesis. [862]
   (Mr. Spencer's system, though called Agnostic, is really a system of
   Monism, and falls into the third class. See Lecture III.)

   II. The Atomistic and Materialistic (Atheistic). The systems of
   Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius, and materialistic systems generally,
   are of this class. As no spiritual principle is recognised, the unity
   can only be sought in a highest law of the elements--in the order of
   the universe--in the way in which things cohere. (But many modern
   systems of Materialism, again, are really monisms, e.g., Haeckel,
   Strauss.)

   III. Pantheistic systems--and these constitute a vast family with a
   great variety of forms. Here the universe is conceived as dependent on
   a first principle or power, but one within itself, of which it is
   simply the necessary unfolding, and with which, in essence, it is
   identical. The systems differ according to the view taken of the nature
   of this principle, and of the law of its evolution. The principle may
   be conceived of:

   1. Predominatingly as physical--in which case the system is allied to
   Materialism (Materialistic Pantheism).

   2. As the vital principle of an organism (Hylozoistic).

   3. As an intelligent world-soul (Stoicism--analogous to fire).

   4. Metaphysically--as Being (Eleatics), Substance (Spinoza), etc.

   5. Spiritually--as impersonal Reason, or Spirit (Hegel), or Will
   (Schopenhauer, etc.).

   Thus, while on its lower side Pantheism is indistinguishable from
   Materialism and Atheism, on its higher side it approaches, and often
   nearly merges into, Theism (as with the Neo-Hegelians).

   IV. Systems which recognise a spiritual, self-conscious Cause of the
   universe. Here belong:

   1. Deism--which views God predominatingly as Creator, but denies
   present communication and Revelation, and practically separates God
   from the world. [863]

   2. Theism--which views God as the Living Creator, Immanent Cause, and
   Moral Ruler of the world and of man.

   3. Christian Trinitarianism--a higher form of Theism. [The division of
   systems as Optimistic and Pessimistic has reference to another
   standpoint--not to the first principle of the system, hut to its
   ethical character and end. As combined with the others, it would form a
   cross-division.]

   There is yet another division of types of world-view (equally important
   for our subject), based, not on their objective character, but on the
   mental attitude of the observer, and on the activities employed in
   their formation- Three main types of world-view may be here
   distinguished, answering to three distinct standpoints of the human
   spirit, from each of which a "Weltanschauung" necessarily results.
   These are:

   1. The "Scientific"--in which the standpoint of the observer is in the
   objective world, and things are viewed, as it were, wholly from
   without. Abstraction is made from the thinking mind, and only external
   relations (co-existence, succession, cause and effect, resemblance,
   etc.) are regarded. The means employed are observation and induction,
   and the end is the discovery of laws, and ultimately of a highest law,
   under which all particular phenomena may be subsumed.

   2. The "Philosophical"--which precisely inverts this relation. The
   standpoint here is the thinking Ego, and things are regarded from
   within in their relations to thought and knowledge. It starts from the
   side of the thinking mind, as science from the side of the world as
   known, in abstraction from the mind knowing it. From the philosophical
   standpoint the world assumes a very different aspect from that which it
   presents to empirical science, or to the ordinary irreflective
   observer. All higher philosophy may be described as an attempt to
   conclude in some way from the unity of reason to the unity of things.
   The resultant world-view will assume two forms, according as the point
   of departure is from the theoretical or the practical reason: (1) a
   theoretical (as in the Absolutist attempts to deduce all things from a
   principle given through pure thought); (2) a moral (e.g. the Kantian).

   3. The "Religious"--which views everything from the standpoint of the
   consciousness of dependence upon God, and refers all back to God. It
   starts from the practical relation in which man stands to God as
   dependent on Him, and desiring His help, support, and furtherance in
   the aims of his life (natural, moral, distinctively religious aims).
   The nature of the religious "Weltanschauung" and its relation to
   theoretic knowledge is discussed later.

   At no time, however, can these points of view be kept perfectly
   distinct, and the claim of either science or philosophy to produce a
   self-sufficing world-view must he pronounced untenable. Insensibly,
   even in the pursuit of science, the standpoint changes from science to
   philosophy; but this, in turn, cannot dispense with the material which
   the sciences and the history of religions furnish to it; and it is
   equally unable, out of its own resources, to produce an adequate and
   satisfying world-view. It cannot therefore take the place of religion,
   or furnish a "Weltanschauung" satisfying to the religious
   consciousness. It is a well-recognised truth that philosophy has
   founded systems and schools, but never religions. [864] The religious
   world-view is better capable of independent existence than the others,
   for here at least the mind is in union with the deepest principle of
   all. But that principle needs to develop itself, and in practice it is
   found that religion also is largely influenced in the construction of
   its world-views by the state of scientific knowledge and the philosophy
   of the time. The Indian religious systems are metaphysical throughout.
   The early Greek fathers of the Church were largely influenced by
   Platonism; the mediaeval schoolmen by Aristotelianism; modern
   theologians by Kant, Hegel, etc. The type of world-view freest from all
   trace of foreign influence is that found in the Old Testament, and
   completed in the New. This unique character belongs to it as the
   religion of Revelation.

   [862] A more extreme type of view still is the denial of the reality of
   the world altogether--Acosmism.

  UNCONSCIOUS METAPHYSIC.

   Schopenhauer has remarked that each man has his metaphysic.

   "The man," says Zeller, "who is without any philosophic standpoint is
   not on that account without any standpoint whatever; he who has formed
   no scientific opinion on philosophical questions has an unscientific
   opinion about them."--Pre-Soc. Phil. p. 23.

   Principal Fairbairn observes: "Professor Tyndall's presidential address
   is memorable enough, were it only as an instance of sweet simplicity in
   things historical, and the most high-flying metaphysics disguised in
   scientific terms."--Studies, p. 65.

   Regarding Mr. Spencer: "Just as the term force revolutionises the
   conception of the Unknowable, so it, in turn, transmuted into forces,
   beguiles the physicist into the fancy that he is walking in the, to
   him, sober and certain paths of observation and experiment, while in
   truth he is soaring in the heaven of metaphysics."--Ibid. p. 97.

   Professor Caird remarks of Comte: "Hence, while he pretends to renounce
   metaphysics, he has committed himself to one of the most indefensible
   of all metaphysical positions. . . . It is a residuum of bad
   metaphysics, which, by a natural Nemesis, seems almost invariably to
   haunt the minds of those writers who think they have renounced
   metaphysics altogether."--Soc. Phil. of Comte, p. 121.

LECTURE I NOTE D.--P. 9.

  ANTAGONISM OF CHRISTIAN AND "MODERN" VIEWS OF THE WORLD--ANTISUPERNATURALISM
  OF THE LATTER.

   I add some illustrations of the remarks made on this subject in the
   text.

   Principal Fairbairn puts the matter thus: "The scientific and religious
   conceptions of the world seem to stand at this moment in the sharpest
   possible antagonism. . . . There is one fact we cannot well
   overrate--the state of conflict or mental schism in which every devout
   man, who is also a man of culture, feels himself compelled more or less
   consciously to live. His mind is an arena in which two conceptions
   struggle for the mastery, and the struggle seems so deadly as to demand
   the death of the one for the life of time other, faith sacrificed to
   knowledge, or knowledge to faith."--Studies in the Philosophy of
   Religion and History, pp. 61, 62.

   The uncompromising character of time conflict amid the nature of the
   issues involved are well brought out in the following extracts from Mr.
   Wicksteed's pamphlet on The Ecclesiastical Institutions of Holland.

   "The religious movement," he says, "known in Holland as that of the
   Modern School,' or New School,' or sometimes the School of Leiden,' is
   essentially a branch of that wider religious movement extending over
   the whole of Europe and America, which is a direct product upon the
   field of religion of the whole intellectual life of the nineteenth
   century.

   "This Modern School, in the larger sense, is in fact essentially the
   religious phase of that undefinable Zeit-Geist,' or spirit of the age,
   sometimes called on the Continent modern consciousness,' the most
   characteristic feature of which is a profound conviction of the organic
   unity, whether spiritual or material, of the universe.

   "This modern consciousness can make no permanent treaty of peace with
   the belief which takes both the history and the philosophic science of
   religion out of organic connection with history and philosophical
   science in general No compromise, no mere profession of a frank
   acceptance of the principles of the modern view of the world, can in
   the long-run avail. The Traditional School cannot content the claims of
   the Zeit-Geist' by concessions. Ultimately, it must either defy it or
   yield to it unconditionally. . . .

   "The task of modern theology, then, is to bring all parts of the
   history of religion into organic connection with each other, and with
   the general history of man, and to find in the human faculties
   themselves, not in something extraneous to them, the foundations of
   religious faith."--Pp. 55, 56.

   The venerable Dr. Delitzsch, from the standpoint of faith, recognises
   the same irreconcilable contrast, and in The Deep Gulf between the Old
   and Modern Theology; a Confession (1890), gives strong expression to
   his sense of the gravity of the situation. "It is plain, he says, "that
   the difference between old and modern theology coincides at bottom with
   the difference between the two conceptions of the world, which are at
   present more harshly opposed than ever before. The modern view of the
   world declares the miracle to be unthinkable, and thus excluded from
   the historical mode of treatment; for there is only one world system,
   that of natural law, with whose permanence the direct, extraordinary
   interferences of God are irreconcilable. [865] . . . When the one
   conception of the world is thus presented from the standpoint of the
   other, the mode of statement unavoidably partakes of the nature of a
   polemic. The special purpose, however, with which I entered on my
   subject was not polemical. I wished to exhibit as objectively as
   possible the deep gap which divides the theologians of to-day,
   especially the thoughtful minds who have come into contact with
   philosophy and science, into two camps. An accommodation of this
   antagonism is impossible. We must belong to the one camp or the other.
   We may, it is true, inside the negative camp, tone down our negation to
   the very border of affirmation, and inside the positive camp we may
   weaken our affirmation so as almost to change it to negation; the
   representation by individuals of the one standpoint or the other leaves
   room for a multitude of gradations and shades. But to the fundamental
   question--Is there a supernatural realm of grace, and within it a
   miraculous interference of God in the world of nature, an interference
   displaying itself most centrally and decisively in the raising of the
   Redeemer from the dead?--to this fundamental question, however we may
   seek to evade it, the answer can only he yes or no. The deep gulf
   remains. It will remain to the end of time. No effort of thought can
   fill it up. There is no synthesis to bridge this thesis and antithesis.
   Never shall we be able, by means of reasons, evidence, or the witness
   of history, to convince those who reject this truth. But this do we
   claim for ourselves, that prophets and apostles, and the Lord Himself,
   stand upon our side; this we claim, that while the others use the
   treasures of God's Word eclectically, we take our stand upon the whole
   undivided truth."--Translation in Expositor, vol. ix. (3rd series), pp.
   50, 53.

   See also Hartmann's Die Krisis des Christenthums in der modernen
   Theologie (1888), and his Selbstzersetzung des Christenthums (1888).
   "From whatever side," he declares, "we may consider the ground-ideas of
   Christianity and those of modern culture, everywhere there stands out
   an irreconcilable contradiction of the two, and it is therefore no
   wonder if this contradiction comes to light more or less in all
   derivative questions."--Selbstzersetzung des Christenthums, p. 30.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [865] Similarly Max MÃ¼ller finds the kernel of the modern conception of
   the World in the idea "that there is law and order in everything, and
   that an unbroken chain of causes and effects holds the whole universe
   together,"--a conception which reduces the miraculous to mere
   seeming.--Anthropological Religion, Preface, p. 10.

  INTERNAL CONFLICTS OF THE "MODERN" VIEW.

   An internecine warfare is waged among the representatives of the
   "modern" view, quite as embittered and irreconcilable as that which
   they unitedly wage against Christianity. A "Kampf der Weltanschauungen"
   is going on here also. Deists, Pantheists, Agnostics, Pessimists,
   Atheists, Positivists, and liberal theologians, unceasingly refute each
   other; and were their respective opinions put to the vote, out of a
   dozen systems, each would be found in a minority of one, with the other
   eleven against it. If escape were sought in a theoretical scepticism,
   which despairs of truth altogether, this would but add another sect to
   the number, which would encounter the hostility of all the rest.

   Not without justice, therefore, does Dr. Darner, after reviewing the
   systems, speak of the attempt to set up a rival view to Christianity as
   ending in a "screaming contradiction."--System of Christian Doctrine,
   i. pp. 121, 122 (Eng. trans.).

   "The atheistic systems of Germany," says Lichtenberger, "have raised
   the standard, or rather the red rag' of Radicalism and Nihilism; and
   have professed that their one and only principle was the very absence
   of principles. The one bond which unites them at bottom is their hatred
   of religion and of Christianity."--History of German Theology in the
   Nineteenth Century, p. 370 (Eng. trans.).

   "It is not here our business," says Beyschlag, "philosophically to
   arrange matters between the Christian theistic Weltanschauung' on the
   one side, and the deistic, or pantheistic, or materialistic, on the
   other, which latter have first to fight out their mortal conflict with
   one another."--Leben Jesu, i. p. 10.

   A few examples in concreto will point the moral better than many
   general statements.

   The columns of the Nineteenth Century for 1884 witnessed an interesting
   controversy between Mr. Herbert Spencer and Mr. Frederick Harrison, in
   which some pretty hard words were bandied to and fro between the
   combatants. Mr. Spencer had written a paper ("Religious Retrospect and
   Prospect," January 1884), developing his theory of the origin of
   religion from ghost-worship, and expounding his own substitute for
   decaying religious faith. To this Mr. Harrison replied in a vigorous
   article (July 1884), ridiculing Mr. Spencer's proposed substitute as
   "The Ghost of Religion," and scoffing at his "Unknowable" as "an
   ever-present conundrum to be everlastingly given up." Extending his
   attack to certain modern Theisms, he said, "The Neo-Theisms have all
   the same mortal weakness that the Unknowable has. They offer no
   kinship, sympathy, or relation whatever between worshippers and
   worshipped. They, too, are logical formulas begotten in controversy,
   dwelling apart from men and the world." "Tacitly implying," retorts Mr.
   Spencer, in a later round of the controversy, "that Mr. Harrison's
   religion supplies this relation" (November 1884), which, as he shows at
   great length, it does not ("Retrogressive Religion," July 1884). Sir
   James Stephen also had offended Mr. Spencer by describing his
   "Unknowable" (June 1884) as "like a gigantic soap-bubble, not burst,
   but blown thinner and thinner till it has become absolutely
   imperceptible"; and Mr. Harrison also returns to the attack ("Agnostic
   Metaphysics," September 1884).

   In a subsequent controversy, Mr. Harrison fares as badly at the hands
   of Professor Huxley as he did at those of Mr. Spencer. Replying to an
   article of his on "The Future of Agnosticism," Professor Huxley says:
   "I am afraid I can say nothing which shall manifest my personal respect
   for this able writer, and for the zeal and energy with which he ever
   and anon galvanises the weakly frame of Positivism, until it looks more
   than ever like John Bunyan's Pope and Pagan rolled into one. There is a
   story often repeated, and I am afraid none the less mythical on that
   account, of a valiant and loud-voiced corporal, in command of two full
   privates, who, falling in with a regiment of the enemy in the dark,
   orders it to surrender under pain of instant annihilation by his force;
   and the enemy surrenders accordingly. I am always reminded of this tale
   when I read the Positivist commands to the forces of Christianity and
   of science; only, the enemy shows no more signs of intending to obey
   now than they have done any time these forty years."--"Agnosticism," in
   Nineteenth Century, February 1889. [866]

   Mr. Samuel Laing, author of Modern Science and Modern Thought, probably
   regards himself as quite a typical representative of the modern spirit.
   The "old creeds," he informs us "must be transformed or die."
   Unfortunately, not content with assailing other people's creeds, he
   undertook the construction of one of his own, [867] concerning which
   Professor Huxley writes: "I speak only for my. self, and I do not dream
   of anathematising and excommunicating Mr. Laing. But when I consider
   his creed, and compare it with the Athanasian, I think I have, on the
   whole, a clearer conception of the meaning of the latter. Polarity,' in
   Art. viii., for example, is a word about which I heard a good deal in
   my youth, when Natur-philosophie' was in fashion, and greatly did I
   suffer from it. For many years past, whenever I have met with polarity'
   anywhere but in a discussion of some purely physical topic, such as
   magnetism, I have shut the book. Mr. Laing must excuse me if the force
   of habit was too much for me when I read his eighth
   article."--Nineteenth Century, February 1889. Mr. Laing's own book is a
   good example of how these "modern" systems eat and devour one another.
   See his criticisms of theories in chap. vii., etc.

   Mr. Rathbone Greg is another writer who laboured hard to demolish "the
   creed of Christendom," while retaining a great personal reverence for
   Jesus. His concessions on this subject, however, did not meet with much
   favour on his own side. Mr. F. W. Newman, in an article on "The New
   Christology," in the Fortnightly Review (December 1873), thus speaks of
   his general treatment: "He has tried and proved the New Testament, and
   has found it wanting, not only as to historical truth, but as to moral
   and religious wisdom; yet he persists in the effort of hammering out of
   it what shall be a guide of life.' In fact, he learns by studying the
   actual world of man; but in his theory he is to discover a fountain of
   wisdom, by penetrating to some essence in a book which he esteems very
   defective and erroneous. This is to rebuild the things he has
   destroyed.' To sit in judgment on Jesus of Nazareth, and convict Him of
   glaring errors, as a first step, and then, as a second, set Him on a
   pedestal to glorify Him as the most Divine of men and the sublimest of
   teachers, a perpetual miracle,--is a very lame and inconsequent
   proceeding. . . . Mr. Greg, as perhaps all our Unitarians, desires a
   purified gospel. Why, then, is not such a thing published? No doubt,
   because it is presently found that nearly every sentence has to he
   either cut out or rewritten."

   Mr. Greg and Mr. Newman are Theists. The latter even writes: "The claim
   of retaining a belief in God, while rejecting a Personal God, I do not
   know how to treat with respect." Mr. Fiske also, author of Cosmic
   Philosophy, is in his own way a Theist. But "Physicus," another
   representative of the "modern" view, in his Candid Examination of
   Theism, can see no evidence for the existence of a God, and speaks thus
   of Mr. Fiske's attempt to develop Theism out of Mr. Spencer's
   philosophy: "I confess that, on first seeing his work, I experienced a
   faint hope that, in the higher departments of of evolution as conceived
   by Mr. Spencer, and elaborated by disciple, there might be found some
   rational justification for an attenuated form of Theism. But on
   examination I find that the bread which these fathers have offered us
   turns out to be a stone....We have but to think of the disgust with
   which the vast majority of living persons would regard the sense in
   which Mr. Fiske uses the term Theism,' to perceive how intimate is the
   association of that term with the idea of a Personal God. Such persons
   will feel strongly that, by this final act of purification, Mr. Fiske
   has simply purified the Deity altogether out of existence."--Candid
   Examination, essay on "Cosmic Theism," pp. 131, 138, and throughout.
   [868]

   Thus the strife goes on. Strauss, in his Old Faith and the New, refutes
   Pessimism; but Hartmann, the Pessimist, retorts on Strauss that he has
   "no philosophic head," and shows the ridiculousness of his demand that
   we should love the Universe. "It is a rather strong, or rather naive
   claim, that we should experience a sentiment of religious piety and
   dependence for a Universum' which is only an aggregate of all material
   substances, and which threatens every instant to crush us between the
   wheels and teeth of its pitiless mechanism."--Selbstzer. des Christ.
   Pref. and p. 81.

   Hartmann may as well speak of the "Selbstzersetzung" and
   "Zersplitterung" of unbelief, as of the disintegration of Christianity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [866] Mr. Harrison complains (Fortnightly Review, October 1892) that
   Mr. Huxley, in this article, has held him up "to public ridicule as
   pontiff, prophet, general humbug, and counterpart of Joe Smith the
   Mormon," and tries to show how much agreement, mostly in negations,
   underlies their differences.

   [867] "It appears that Mr. Gladstone, some time ago, asked Mr. Laing if
   he could draw up a short summary of the negative creed; a body of
   negative propositions which have so far been adopted on the negative
   aide as to be what the Apostles' and other accepted creeds are on the
   positive; and Mr. Laing at once kindly obliged Mr. Gladstone with the
   desired articles--eight of them."--Professor Huxley, as above.

   [868] It has already been noted that the author, Mr. G. J. Romanes,
   returned later to the Christian faith. See his Thoughts on Religion,
   edited by Canon Gore (1895).

LECTURE I NOTE F.--P. 9.

  UNIQUENESS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT VIEW.

   It may be Confidently affirmed that the drift of modern Criticism and
   research has not been to lower, but immensely to exalt, our conceptions
   of the unique character of the Old Testament religion. The views of the
   critics of the earlier stages of the religion of Israel are low and
   poor enough, but, as if in compensation, they exalt the "Ethical
   Monotheism" and spiritual religion of the prophets and psalms, till one
   feels, in reading their works, that truly this religion of Israel is
   something unexampled on the face of the earth, and is not to be
   accounted for on purely natural principles. Schleiermacher and Hegel
   spoke disparagingly of the Old Testament, but this is not the more
   recent tendency. The following are some testimonies from various
   standpoints.

   Lotze, in his Microcosmus, bears a noble testimony to the uniqueness of
   the Old Testament religion, and to the sublimity and unparalleled
   character of its literature. "Among the theocratically governed nations
   of the East," he says, "the Hebrews seem to us as sober men among
   drunkards" (vol. ii. p. 267, Eng. trans.). See his spirited sketch of
   the Old Testament view (pp. 466-468), and his eulogy of the literature
   (pp. 402-404).

   Dr. Hutcheson Stirling says: "The sacred writings of the Hebrews,
   indeed, are so immeasurably superior to those of every other name,
   that, I or the sake of the latter, to invite a comparison is to undergo
   instantaneous extinction. Nay, regard these Scriptures as a literature
   only, the literature of the Jews--even then, in the kind of quality, is
   there any literature to be compared with it? Will it not even then
   remain still the sacred literature? A taking simpleness, a simple
   takingness, that is Divine--all that can lift us out of our own
   week-day selves, and place us, pure then, holy, rapt, in the joy and
   the peace of Sabbath feeling and Sabbath vision, is to be found in the
   mere nature of these old idylls, in the full-filling sublimity of these
   psalms, in the inspired God-words of these intense-souled
   prophets."--Phil. and Theol. (Gifford Lectures), pp. 18, 19.

   Dr. Robertson Smith has well brought out the singularity and elevation
   of the Hebrew view in contrast with that of the other Semitic and Aryan
   nations, in his Religion of the Semites (Burnett Lectures). "The idea
   of absolute and ever-watchful Divine justice," he says, "as we find it
   in the prophets, is no more natural to the East than to the West, for
   even the ideal Semitic king is, as we have seen, a very imperfect
   earthly providence; and, moreover, he has a different standard of right
   for his own people and for strangers. The prophetic idea that Jehovah
   will vindicate the right, even in the destruction of His own people of
   Israel, involves an ethical standard as foreign to Semitic as to Aryan
   tradition" (p. 74).

   Again: "While in Greece the idea of the unity of God was a
   philosophical speculation, without any definite point of attachment to
   actual religion, the Monotheism of the Hebrew prophets kept touch with
   the ideas and institutions of the Semitic race, by conceiving of the
   one true God as the King of absolute justice, the national God of
   Israel, who, at the same time, was, or rather was destined to become,
   the God of all the earth, not merely because His power was world-wide,
   but because, as the perfect ruler, He could not fail to draw all
   nations to do Him homage" (p. 75).

   Again: "The Hebrew ideal of a Divine Kingship that must one day draw
   all men to do it homage, offered better things than these, not in
   virtue of any feature that it possessed in common with the Semitic
   religions as a whole, but solely in virtue of its unique conception of
   Jehovah as a God whose love for His people was conditioned by a law of
   absolute righteousness. In other nations individual thinkers rose to
   lofty conceptions of a supreme Deity, but in Israel, and in Israel
   alone, these conceptions were incorporated in the conception of the
   national God. And so, of all the gods of the nations, Jehovah alone was
   fitted to become the God of the whole earth" (pp. 80, 81).

   Kuenen writes thus of the universalism of the prophets: "What was thus
   revealed to the eye of their spirit was no less than the august idea of
   the moral government of the world--crude as yet, and with manifold
   admixture of error (l) but pure in principle. The prophets had no
   conception of the mutual connection of the powers or operations of
   nature. They never dreamed of carrying them hack to a single cause, or
   deducing them from it. But what they did see, on the field within their
   view, was the realisation of a single plan--everything, not only the
   tumult of the peoples, but all nature likewise, subservient to the
   working out of one great purpose. The name Ethical Monotheism'
   describes better than any other the characteristics of their point of
   view, for it not only expresses the character of the one God whom they
   worshipped, but also indicates the fountain whence their faith in Him
   welled up."--Hibbert Lectures, pp. 124, 125.

   "So far," says Mr. Gladstone, "then, the office and work of the Old
   Testament, as presented to us by its own contents is without a compeer
   among the old religions. It deals with the case of man as a whole. It
   covers all time. It is alike adapted to every race and region of the
   earth. And how, according to the purport of the Old Testament, may that
   case best be summed up? In these words: It is a history first of sin,
   and next of Redemption."--God in the Bible p. 87. See the whole chapter
   on "The Office and Work of the Old Testament in Outline."

   I may add a few words of personal testimony from Professor Monier
   Williams, on the comparison of the Scriptures with the Sacred Books of
   the East. "When I began investigating Hinduism and Buddhism, I found
   many beautiful gems; nay, I met with bright coruscations of true light
   flashing here and there amid the surrounding darkness. As I prosecuted
   my researches into these non-Christian systems, I began to foster a
   fancy that they had been unjustly treated. I began to observe and trace
   out curious coincidences and comparisons with our own Sacred Book of
   the East. I began, in short, to be a believer in what is called the
   evolution and growth of religious thought. These imperfect systems,' I
   said to myself, are interesting efforts of the human mind struggling
   upwards towards Christianity. Nay, it is probable that they were all
   intended to lead up to the one true religion, and that Christianity is,
   after all, merely the climax, the complement, the fulfilment of them
   all.'

   "Now, there is unquestionably a delightful fascination about such a
   theory, and, what is more, there are really elements of truth in it.
   But I am glad of this opportunity of stating publicly that I am
   persuaded I was misled by its attractiveness, and that its main idea is
   quite erroneous.... We welcome these books. We ask every missionary to
   study their contents, and thankfully lay hold of whatsoever things are
   true and of good report in them. But we warn him that there can be no
   greater mistake than to force these non-Christian bibles into
   conformity with some scientific theory of development, and then point
   to the Christian's Holy Bible as the crowning product of religious
   evolution. So far from this, these non-Christian bibles are all
   developments in the wrong direction. They all begin with some flashes
   of true light, and end in utter darkness. Pile them, if you will, on
   the left side of your study table, but place your own Holy Bible on the
   right side--all by itself, all alone--and with a wide gap
   between."--Quoted by Joseph Cook in God in the Bible (Boston Lectures),
   p. 16.

  ORIGIN OF THE OLD TESTAMENT VIEW--RELATION TO CRITICAL THEORIES.

   Many feel that from the peculiarity of Israel's religion referred to in
   last note the need will arise sooner or later for recasting the whole
   critical view of the development. The more rich and wonderful the
   religious development of the age of the prophets is shown to be, the
   more will it be felt necessary to postulate something in the earlier
   stages to account for this development--the more natural and life-like
   will Israel's own account of its history appear [869] --the more
   impossible will it be found to explain the presence of such a
   development of religion at all apart from the fact of supernatural
   Revelation.

   As it is, there is a growing acknowledgment among the critics of the
   most advanced school, that, date the books when we may, the religion
   can only be explained by Revelation. I quote from three recent works.

   H. Schultz, in his new edition of his Alttestamentliche Theologie,
   1889, thus writes: "The Old Testament religion is thus only to be
   explained out of Revelation; that is to say, out of the fact that God
   raised up to this people men, in whose original religious and moral
   endowment, developed through the leadings of their inner and outer
   life, the receptivity was given for an absolutely original
   comprehension of the self-communicating, redeeming will of God towards
   men, the religious truth which makes free--not as a result of human
   wisdom or intellectual effort, but as an irresistible, constraining
   power on the soul itself. Only he who explicitly recognises this can do
   historical justice to the Old Testament" (p. 50).

   R. Kittel, in his recent valuable Geschichte der HebrÃ¤er, 1888-92, also
   based, though discriminatingly, on the results of the later criticism,
   thus sums up on the question: "Whence did Moses derive his knowledge of
   God?" "The historian stands here," he says, "before a mystery, which is
   almost unique in history. A solution is only to be found if in that gap
   a factor is inserted, the legitimacy of which can no more be proved by
   strict historical methods. There are points in the life of humanity
   where history goes over into the philosophy of history, and speculation
   must illuminate with its retrospective and interpreting light the
   otherwise permanently dark course of the historical process. Such a
   case is here. Only an immediate contact of God Himself with man can
   produce the true knowledge of God, or bring man a real stage nearer to
   it. For in himself man finds only the world, and his own proper ego.
   Neither one nor the other yields more than heathenism: the former a
   lower, the latter a higher form of it. Does the thought flash on Moses
   that God is neither the world nor the idealised image of man, but that
   He is the Lord of Life, of moral commands, exalted above multiplicity
   and the world of sense, and the Creator, who does not crush man, but
   ennobles him; so has he this knowledge, not out of his time, and not
   out of himself--he has it out of an immediate Revelation of this God in
   his heart."--Geschichte, i. pp. 227, 228.

   Alex. Westphal, author of an able French work, Les Sources du
   Pentateuque, Etude de Critique et d'Histoire, 1888-92, is another
   writer who uncompromisingly accepts the results of the advanced
   critical school. But he earnestly repudiates, in the Preface to the
   above work, the idea that these results destroy, and do not rather
   confirm, faith in Revelation, and even builds on them an argument for
   the historic truthfulness of the early tradition. He separates himself
   in this respect from the unbelieving position. "Truth to tell," he
   says, "the unanimity of scholars exists only in relation to one of the
   solutions demanded, that of the literary problem....The position which
   the scholar takes up towards the books which lie studies, and his
   personal views on the history and the religious development of Israel,
   always exercise, whether he wishes it or not a considerable influence
   on the results of his work. However, we may be permitted to affirm, and
   hope one day to be able to prove, that the reply to the historic
   question belongs to evangelical criticism, which, illuminated by the
   spirit of Revelation, alone possesses all the factors for the solution
   of this grave problem. . . . Far from being dismayed by the fact that
   the plurality of sources involves profound modifications in our
   traditional notion of the Pentateuch written by Moses, we should rather
   see in it a providential intervention, at the moment when it is most
   necessary, a decisive argument in favour of the primitive
   history."--Les Sources, i. Preface, p. 28.

LECTURE I NOTE H.--P. 16.

  NATURE AND DEFINITION OF RELIGION.

   In strictness these Lectures ought to have included a treatment of the
   general question of religion as preparatory to the consideration of the
   specific Christian view. Christianity involves a "Weltanschauung" and
   it belongs to the type "religious." It ought therefore to be shown in
   what distinctively a religious "Weltanschauung" consists, and how the
   Christian view is related to the general conception. This, again, would
   involve an inquiry into the general nature of religion; in order, on
   this basis, to show how a "Weltanschauung" necessarily originates from
   it. A few notes are all that can be attempted here, in addition to what
   is said in the text of various portions of the Lectures, and in
   Appendix to Lecture III.

   The main question is as to the general character, or essential nature,
   of religion, as a means of understanding how a "Weltanschauung" springs
   from it.

   I. It may be remarked that this question is not answered--

   1. By an abstract definition of religion. Much has been written on the
   definition of religion. [870] A prior question is, In what sense do we
   speak of definition? Do we mean to include in our definition of
   religion only the common elements in all religions; or do we propose to
   define by the idea of religion, as that may be deduced from the study
   of the laws of man's nature, seen in their manifestation on the field
   of history, and most conspicuously in the higher religions? The fault
   of most definitions is that, aiming at a generality wide enough to
   embrace the most diverse manifestations of the religious
   consciousness,--the lowest and most debased equally with the most
   complex and exalted,--they necessarily leave out all that is purest and
   most spiritual in religion--that which expresses its truest essence.
   They give us, in short, a logical summum genus, which may be useful
   enough for some purposes, but is utterly barren and unprofitable as a
   key to the interpretation of any spiritual fact. On the other hand, if
   we take as our guide the idea of religion, we may be accused of finding
   only one religion which corresponds to it--the Christian; and in any
   case the definition will leave outside of it a vast variety of
   religious phenomena. What is wanted is not a logical definition which
   will apply to nothing from which its marks are absent, but such a
   comprehension of the inner principle and essential character of
   religion as will enable us to discern its presence under forms that
   very rudely and imperfectly express it. [871]

   2. By exclusively psychological or historical methods in the treatment
   of religion. These are the methods in vogue at the present day in what
   is designated "The Science of Religions." I call a theory psychological
   which seeks to account for the ideas and beliefs which men entertain
   regarding their deities by tracing them to psychological causes,
   without raising the question of how far these ideas and beliefs have
   any objective truth. Psychology deals with the empirical--the given. It
   observes the facts of the religious consciousness--groups and
   classifies them--seeks to resolve the complex into the simple, the
   compound into the elementary--notes the laws and relations which
   discover themselves in the different phenomena, etc. In doing this, it
   performs a necessary service, but its method is liable to certain
   obvious drawbacks.

   (l) If religion is a necessity of human nature, springing by an inner
   necessity from the rational and spiritual nature of man, this method
   can never show it. Psychology can only show what is, not what must or
   should be. Its function is ended when it has described and analysed
   facts as they are. It does not reach inner necessity. From the
   persistency with which religion appears and maintains itself in human
   nature, it may infer that there is some deep and necessary ground for
   it in the spirit of man, but it lies beyond the scope of its methods to
   show what that is. Its line is too short to reach down to these depths.

   (2) It is a temptation in these theories to aim at an undue simplicity.
   This is a fault, indeed, of most theories of religion, that they do not
   do justice to the multiplicity of factors involved in religion, but,
   haying hold on one of these factors, exalt it to exclusive importance
   at the expense of the rest. Religion is a highly complex thing,
   blending in itself a multitude of elements readily
   distinguishable,--hopes and fears, belief in the invisible, the feeling
   of dependence, the sense of moral relation, desire for fellowship,
   emotions of awe, love, reverence, surrender of the will, etc.,--and I
   suppose no definition of it has ever been constructed which did not
   leave out some of its extraordinarily varied manifestations. Theories,
   therefore, err which attempt to deduce all religious sentiments and
   ideas from some one principle, e.g., Hume, from man's hopes and fears;
   Tylor, from the animistic tendency in human nature; Spencer, from
   ghost-worship; Feuerbach, from man's egoistic wishes--"What man would
   have liked to be, but was not, he made his god; what he would like to
   have, but could not get for himself, his god was to get for him"
   (Strauss); others from Totemism, etc. [872]

   (3) It is a common error of these theories to study religion chiefly as
   it presents itself in the lowest, poorest, crudest manifestations of
   the religious consciousness; and to suppose that if they can explain
   these, all the higher stages of religious development can be explained
   in the same way. This is much the same as if a botanist, wishing to
   exhibit the essential characteristics of plant life, were to confine
   his attention to the lowest order of plants, and even to the most
   dwarfed, stunted, and impoverished specimens of these.

   (4) It is a further weakness of psychological theories that they move
   solely in the region of the subjective. They occupy themselves with
   psychological causes, and with the ideas and fancies to which these
   give rise; but have nothing to teach us of the object of
   religion--neither what the true object is, nor whether a true object is
   to be known at all. Their function is ended when they have described
   and analysed facts; they claim no right to pass judgment. They have, in
   other words, no objective standard of judgment. Yet the question of the
   object is the one of essential importance in religion, as determining
   whether it has any ground in objective truth, or is only, as Feuerbach
   would have it, a deceptive play of the human consciousness with itself.
   [873]

   (5) Finally, even the higher class of psychological theories form a
   very inadequate basis for a true conception of religion.
   Schleiermacher, e.g., explains religion as the immediate consciousness
   of the infinite in the finite, and of the eternal in the temporal; Max
   Muller as the perception of the infinite, [874] etc. But if we ask in
   Kantian fashion, How is such an immediate consciousness--feeling or
   perception--possible? what view of man's nature is implied in his
   capacity to have a consciousness, or feeling, or perception of the
   infinite? we are driven back on deeper ground, and come in view of a
   rational nature in man which transforms the whole problem. [875]

   The same criticisms apply in part to the historical treatment of
   religion. This, like the psychological, has its own part to play in the
   construction of a philosophy of religion; its help, indeed, is of
   untold value. By its aid we see not only what religion is in its actual
   manifestations; not only get an abundance of facts to check narrow and
   hasty generalisations; but we find a grand demonstration of the
   universality of religion. Yet the historical treatment, again, like the
   psychological, does not furnish us with more than the materials from
   which to construct a theory of religion. If the historical student, in
   addition to recording and classifying his facts, and observing their
   laws, passes judgment on them as true or false, good or evil, his
   inquiry is no longer historical merely, but has become theological or
   philosophical.

   3. Our question is not answered by explaining religion out of the
   necessity which man feels of maintaining his personality and spiritual
   independence against the limitations of nature. This, as shown in Note
   A., is the Ritschlian position, and the passages there quoted
   illustrate how Ritschl and his followers develop a "Weltanschauung"
   from it. Its value lies in the recognition of the fact that religion
   contains not only a relation of dependence, but a practical impulse
   towards freedom; and in this sense the Ritschlian mode of
   representation has extended far beyond the limits of the school. Thus
   Pfleiderer (otherwise a sharp critic of Ritschl) says: "There belongs
   to the religious consciousness some degree of will, some free self
   determination. And what this aims at is simply to be made quite free
   from the obstructing limit and dependence which our freedom encounters
   in the world" (Religionsphilosophie, i. p. 323, Eng. trans.). "In the
   religious Weltanschauung,'" says Lipsius, "there is always posited on
   the part of man the striving to place himself in a practical relation
   to this higher power on which he knows himself and his world to be
   dependent, in order that through this he may further his well-being
   against the restrictions of the outer world, and victoriously maintain
   his self-consciousness as a spiritual being against the finite
   limitations of his natural existence" (Dogmatik, p. 25). Reville says:
   "Religion springs from the feeling that man is in such a relation to
   this spirit that for his well-being, and in order to gratify a
   spontaneous impulse of his nature, he ought to maintain with it such
   relations as will afford him guarantees against the unknown of destiny"
   (History of Religions, p. 29, Eng. trans.). [876] In its Ritschlian
   form, this theory is open to very serious objections. Professing to
   account for religion, it really inverts the right relation between God
   and the world, making the soul's relation to the world the first thing,
   and the relation to God secondary and dependent; instead of seeking in
   an immediate relation to God the first and unique fact which sustains
   all others. [877] While, further, it may be conceded to Ritschl and his
   followers that the primary motive: in religion is practical (though not
   prior to the immediate impression or consciousness of the Divine in
   nature, in the sense of dependence, in conscience, etc.), it must he
   insisted on that the practical motive is such as can originate only in
   beings with a rational nature,--i.e. reason underlies it. [878] Had
   this been kept in view, it would have helped to prevent the strong
   division which this school makes between religious and theoretic
   knowledge.

   II. The rational self-consciousness of man being posited as the
   ground-work, we may with confidence recognise the following as elements
   entering into the essence of religion, and connecting themselves with
   its development:--

   1. There is first the sense of absolute dependence, justly emphasised
   by Schleiermacher (Der christ. Glaube, sect. 4). But this alone is not
   sufficient to constitute religion. Everything depends on the kind of
   power on which we feel ourselves dependent. Absolute dependence, e.g.,
   on a blind power, or on an inevitable fate or destiny, would not
   produce in us the effects we commonly ascribe to religion. With the
   sense of dependence there goes an impulse to freedom. The aim of
   religion, it has been justly said, is to transform the relation of
   dependence into one of freedom. This involves, of course, the shaping
   of the idea of the Godhead into that of personal spirit.

   2. Equally original with the feeling of dependence, accordingly, is the
   impulse in religion to go out of oneself in surrender to a higher
   object--the impulse to worship. The idea of this higher object may be
   at first dim and indistinct, but the mind instinctively seeks such an
   object, and cannot rest till it finds one adequate to its own nature.
   Here, again, the rational nature of man is seen at work, impelling him
   to seek the true infinite, and allowing him no rest till such an object
   is found.

   3. Another directly religious impulse is the desire that is early
   manifested to bring life, and the circle of interests connected with it
   under the immediate care and sanction of the Divine. This, which has
   its origin in the sense of weakness and finitude is apparent in all
   religions, and brings religion within the circle of men's hopes and
   fears.

   4. As moral ideas advance,--and we do not here discuss how this advance
   is possible,--the ground is prepared for yet higher ideas of God, and
   of His relations to the world and man. There has now entered the idea
   of a moral end; man also has become aware of the contradictions which
   beset his existence as a being at once free, and yet hemmed in and
   limited on every side in the attainment of his ends; not to speak of
   the deeper contradictions (within and without) which beset his
   existence through sin. It is here that the idea of religion links
   itself with the moral "Weltanschauung" of Ritschl, Lipsius, Pfleiderer,
   and others, who find the solution of these antinomies in the idea of a
   teleological government of the world, in which natural ends are
   everywhere subordinated to moral; which, again, implies the
   monotheistic idea of God, and faith in His moral government, and out of
   which springs the idea of a "kingdom of God" as the end of the Divine
   conduct of history.

   It does not follow, because this conception, or rather that of the
   Father-God of Christ, is the only one capable of satisfying man's
   religious or moral aspirations, that therefore man has been able to
   produce it from his own resources. Even if he were able, this alone
   would not satisfy the religious necessity. For religion craves not
   merely for the idea of God, but for personal fellowship and communion
   with Him, and this can only take place on the ground that God and man
   are in seine way brought together--in other words, on the basis of
   Divine Revelation or manifestation.

   III. We may perhaps test the statements now made, by applying them to
   two cases which seem at first sight to contradict them, viz. Buddhism,
   and the Comtist "Religion of Humanity"; for in neither of these systems
   have we the recognition of a God. Are they, then, properly to be
   accounted religions?

   1. Buddhism is a religion, but it is not so in virtue of its negation
   of the Divine, but in virtue of the provision it still makes for the
   religions nature of man. Buddhism, as it exists to-day, is anything but
   a system of Atheism or Agnosticism; it is a positive faith, with
   abundance of supernatural elements. It may have begun with simple
   reverence for Buddha,--itself a substitute for worship,--but the
   undistilled cravings of the heart for worship soon demanded more.
   Invention rushed in to fill the vacuum in the original creed, and the
   heavens which Buddha had left tenantless were repeopled with gods,
   saints, prospective Buddhas, and still higher imperishable essences,
   ending in the practical deification of Buddha himself. Buddhism has all
   the paraphernalia of a religion,--priests, temples, images, worship,
   etc. [879]

   2. In like manner, Comte's system has a cult, in which the sentiments
   and affections which naturally seek their outlet in the direction of
   the Divine are artificially directed to a new object, collective
   humanity, which man is hid adore as the "Grand Etre," along with space
   as the "Grand Milieu," and the earth as the "Grand Fetiche"! There is
   the smell of the lamp in all this, which betrays too obviously the
   character of Comtism as an artificial or "manufactured" religion; but
   if it receives this name, it is because there is an application of
   Divine attributes to objects which, however unworthy of having Divine
   honours paid to them, are still worshipped as substitutes for God, and
   so form an inverted testimony to the need which the soul feels for God.

   [876] Kaftan, on the other hand, finds the root-motive of religion in
   the infinity of the "claim on life" inseparable from our nature, which
   this world is not able to satisfy. "Generally the claim on life
   (Auspruch auf Leben) lies at the foundation of religion. That this
   claim is not satisfied in the world, and further through the world, is
   the common motive of all religions" (Das Wesen, p. 67, cf. 60). But
   whence this "claim on life"? Why this striving after an infinite and
   "liberweltlichen" good? What view of man's nature is implied in the
   possibility of such strivings? These are questions which Kaftan does
   not answer, but which a true theory of religion should answer.

   [877] See criticism of this theory of religion in Pfleiderer's Die
   Ritschl'sche Theologie, p. 17ff., and in Stahlin's Kant, Lotze, und
   Ritschl, pp. 218-250 (Eng. trans.); and A. Dorner's Das menschliche
   Erkennen, p. 221.

   [878] See further, Appendix to Lecture III. On the other hand,
   Hegelianism would have us view religion as but a lower stage in the
   progress to pure philosophical thought. I have not discussed this
   theory in the text, as it does not represent any immediately reigning
   tendency. With Hegel the idea is everything. Religious truths are but
   rational ideas clothed in a sensuous garb. It is the part of philosophy
   to lift the veil, and raise the idea to the form of pure thought.
   Religion gives the "Vorstellung," or figurate representation;
   philosophy give the rational conception, or "Begriff." The distinction
   is explained by Hegel in the Introduction to his Geschichte der
   Philosophie, vol. i. pp. 79-97. A fuller exposition is given in his
   Religionsphilosophie, vol. i. pp. 20-25. From this theory the reaction
   was inevitable which led to the repudiation of the metaphysical in
   theology altogether. One of the most delicate tasks of theology is to
   adjust the relation between these opposite one-sidednesses.

  UNDOGMATIC RELIGION.

   The type of view described in the text is too Common to need further
   characterization. I add one or two illustrations.

   "To leave the religious idea in its more complete indeterminateness,"
   says Renan, "to hold at the same time to those two propositions: (l)
   Religion will be eternal in humanity'; (2) All religious symbols are
   assailable and perishable'; such, then, will be, if the opinion of the
   wise could he that of the majority, the true theology of our time. All
   those who labour to show, beyond the symbols, the pure sentiment which
   constitutes the soul of them, labour for the future. To what, in fact,
   will you attach religion, if this immortal basis does not suffice
   you?"--Fragments Philosophiques, p. 392.

   Reville says: "If religions are mortal, religion never dies, or we may
   say, it dies under one form only to come to life again under another.
   There is then underneath and within this multicoloured development a
   permanent and substantial element, something stable and imperishable,
   which takes a firm hold on human nature itself." --History of
   Religions, p. 3 (Eng. trans.).

   M. Reville is a distinguished member of the Liberal Protestant party in
   France, whose programme was summed up thus in their organ,
   L'Emancipation: "A Church without a priesthood; a religion without a
   catechism; a morality without dogmatics; a God without an obligatory
   system."

LECTURE I NOTE J.--P. 19.

  ESTHETIC THEORIES OF RELIGION.

   The theories which ascribe to the ideals and beliefs of religion only
   an imaginative, poetic, or aesthetic value, constitute a large family.
   In Christian theology the tendency found a representative in the
   beginning of the century in De Wette, whose "aesthetic rationalism" is
   explained and criticised by Dorner (Doctrine of the Person of Christ,
   v. pp. 51-58, Eng. trans.) and Pfleiderer (Development of Theology, pp.
   97-102). On the side of materialistic science, the best-known
   representative is Fr. A. Lange, author of the History of Materialism
   (1875), whose positions are yet more fearlessly carried out by his
   disciple Vaihinger: "We ought to have, and may have, a theory of the
   world (or religion), but we must not believe in it theoretically; we
   must only allow ourselves to be practically, aesthetically, ethically
   influenced by it." See this theory explained and acutely criticised in
   Stahlin's Kant, Lotze, und Ritschl, pp. 92, 110 (Eng. trans.); and in
   Pfleiderer's Religionsphilosophie, ii. pp. 173-175. From the idealistic
   side, this view, again, is represented by Vacherot in his La
   Metaphysique et la Science (1858): "God is the idea of the world, and
   the world is the reality of God." His theory is criticised at length by
   Caro, in his L'Idee de Dieu, chap. v., and in Renan's Fragments
   Philosophiques, pp. 207-324. Finally, Feuerbach, from thee atheistic
   side, regards the idea of God as a mere illusion--the projection by man
   of his own ego into infinity. See his Wesen des Christenthums.
   (translated).

   Professor Seth has said of this class of theories as a whole: "The
   faith bred of ignorance is neither stable, nor is it likely to be
   enlightened. It will either be a completely empty acknowledgment, as we
   see in the belief in the Unknowable, or it will be an arbitrary play of
   poetic fancy, such a's is proposed by Lange for our consolation. Our
   phenomenal world, says Lange, is a world of materialism; but still the
   Beyond of the Unknowable remains to us. There we may figure to
   ourselves an ampler and diviner air, and may construct a more perfect
   justice and goodness than we find on earth. The poets, in word and
   music and painting, are the chief interpreters of this land of the
   ideal. To them we must go if we would restore our jaded spirits. But we
   may not ask--or if we do, we cannot learn--whether this fairy land
   exists, or whether it lea's any relation to the world of fact. To all
   which it may be confidently replied, that such an empty play of fancy
   can discharge the functions neither of philosophy nor of religion. The
   synthesis of philosophy and the clear confidence of religion may both,
   in a sense, transcend the actual data before us, and may both,
   therefore, have a certain affinity with poetry; but the synthesis is
   valueless and the confidence ill-timed if they do not express our
   deepest insight into facts, and our deepest belief as to the ultimate
   nature of things."--Scottish Philosophy, pp. 178, 179.

  RELIGIOUS AND THEORETIC KNOWLEDGE.

   A. Dorner states the distinction as it appears in recent theology and
   philosophy thus: "It has recently been sought in manifold ways, under a
   stimulus derived from Kant, to find an essential distinction between
   theoretic knowledge, and a knowledge which does not extend our
   knowledge of objects in the least, but stands solely in the service of
   purely subjective interests. This latter has only the significance of
   expressing in any given case the worth of the object for the subject;
   these notions have nothing whatever to do with the knowledge of truth,
   but only with practical interests; therefore our knowledge is not
   furthered through any of these notions, but they are only the means for
   the attainment of subjective ends. Shortly, knowing is placed here at
   the service of another mental function, and on this account produces,
   not objective knowledge, but only representations (Vorstellungen),
   which are formed in a foreign interest, but are perfectly indifferent
   as to whether they also extend our knowledge--help-representations we
   may call them, formed in order by their means to reach other ends.
   Should reference be made to truth, this would still in nowise have
   anything to do with knowledge; the truth of such representations would
   he measured solely by this, whether with their help one does or does
   not attain the wished-for end,--irrespective of whether these
   representations were in themselves mere phantasies or not. Just for
   this reason is all metaphysical worth refused to such notions, e.g.
   aesthetic or religious."--Das menschliche Erkennen, "Die auf
   Werthurtheile ruhenden Begriffe," pp. 170, 171.

   The kindredship of this view to the "aesthetic rationalism" referred to
   in last note is greater than is sometimes acknowledged; in one disciple
   of the school, Bender, it becomes indistinguishable from it. (See his
   Das Wesen der Religion, 1886.) It should, however, be remarked that
   Kaftan has severed himself from the extreme positions of this school,
   and has sought in his various works to find an adjustment between faith
   and theoretic knowledge which will avoid the appearance of collision
   between them. He expressly hays down the proposition that "there is
   only one truth, and that all truth is from God"; acknowledges that
   faith-propositions have their theoretic side, and that "in the
   treatment of the truth of the Christian religion it is the theoretic
   side of these which comes into consideration"; explains that "truth" in
   this connection means simply what it does in other cases, not
   subjective truth, but "objective"--"the agreement of the proposition
   with the real state of the case," etc. (Die Wahrheit, pp. 1-7.) Most
   significant of all is his statement in a recent article that he has
   abandoned the expression "Werthurtheile" altogether, as liable to
   misunderstanding. "I have," he says, "in this attempt to describe the
   knowledge of faith according to its kind and manner of origin, avoided
   the expression Werthurtheile,' although I have earlier so characterised
   the propositions of faith (in which the knowledge of faith is given).
   They are theoretic judgments, which are grounded upon a judgment of
   worth, which therefore cannot he appropriated without entering into
   this judgment of worth which lies at their foundation."--"Glaube und
   Dogmatik" in Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Theol. und Kirche, i. 6, p. 501.

   Cf. further on this distinction, Stahlin's acute criticism in his Kant,
   Lotze, und Ritschl, pp. 157ff. (Eng. trans.); Hartmann in his
   Religionsphilosophie, ii. pp. 1-27; Lipsius in his Dogmatik, pp. 16-93.
   Hartmann and Lipsius deal at length with the distinction and relations
   of the "religious" and the "theoretic" "Weltanschauung."

  THE CENTRAL PLACE OF CHRIST IN HIS RELIGION.

   The unique and central place of Christ in His religion, different from
   that of other founders of religion, is attested by writers of the most
   varied standpoints.

   Hegel says: "If we regard Christ in the same light as Socrates, we
   regard him as a mere man, like the Mahometans, who consider Christ to
   have been an ambassador from God, as all great men may generally be
   called ambassadors or messengers of God. If we say no more of Christ
   than that He was a teacher of mankind, and a martyr for truth, we
   express ourselves neither from the Christian point of view, nor from
   that of true religion."--Phil. d. Rel. ii. p. 287.

   Schelling says, in his Phil. d. Offenbarung: "The principal content of
   Christianity is, first, Christ Himself; not what He said, but what He
   is, and did. Christianity is not, in the first place, a doctrine; it is
   a thing, something objective; and time doctrine can never be anything
   but the expression of the thing."--Quoted by Pfleiderer,
   Religionsphilosophie, ii. p. 16 (Eng. trans.).

   Darner bears witness to the valuable service of Schelling and Hegel in
   overcoming the older rationalism, and introducing a profounder
   treatment of the Christological questions.--Doctrine of the Person of
   Christ, v. pp. 100, 138 (Eng. trans.).

   De Wette says: "The personality of Jesus, His life and death, and faith
   in Him, constitute the centre of Christianity. The spirit of religion
   became personal in Him, and, proceeding from Him, exerted an influence
   upon the world, which stood in need of a new religious life, in order
   to regenerate it."--Vorles. Ã¼ber die Religion, p. 444 (quoted by
   Hagenbach).

   Pfleiderer thus sums up the views of Vatke, a post-Hegelian: "All the
   streams of the world's history issue in the kingdom of God, which is
   the will of God in its concrete development to a moral commonwealth.
   Providence here acts as an actual spirit through all persons and deeds,
   through which the idea of the good becomes more real, especially
   through the creative world-historical persons, among whom Christ
   occupies a unique position as the centre-point of history, as the
   Revealer and the Reality of the archetypal idea, as the love of God
   grown personal."--Religionsphilosophie, ii. p. 268 (Eng. trans.).

   On the views of Biedermann and Lipsius, see the Christliche Dogmatik of
   the former, ii. pp. 580-600 ("the central dogma of the Christian
   principle"), and the Lehrb. d. Dogmatik of the latter, pp. 535-538. "In
   its dogmatic utterances on the Person and work of Christ," Lipsius
   says, "the Church expresses the consciousness that its existence has
   its historical foundation in the Person of Jesus, not merely in the
   sense which would be suitable to all other religions having personal
   founders, but in the sense that the Person of Christ is the archetypal
   representation of the Christian idea, and therefore the authoritative
   pattern for all time to come; and that His work forms the permanently
   sufficient, therefore the creative, basis for the constantly
   progressing realisation of that idea in the common and individual life
   of Christians."--Dog. p. 537.

   Ritschl says: "The Person of the Founder of Christianity is the key to
   the Christian Weltanschauung,' and the standard f or the self-judgment
   and moral striving of Christians."--Recht. u. Ver. iii. p. 193 (3rd
   ed.). Cf. the comparison with Moses, Zoroaster, Mahomet, and Buddha, in
   pp. 364, 365.

   Kaftan emphatically says: "In the question of the Godhead of Jesus
   Christ, the discussion turns, not on one proposition among others which
   a Christian recognises and confesses, but upon the central point of the
   entire Christian confession of faith."--Brauchen wir ein neues Dogma?
   p. 52.

   Hartmann, too, in his Krisis des Christenthums, treats this doctrine as
   the central matter, and discusses it in his first section under the
   heading, "The Christian Central Dogma and its inevitable Dissolution."
   Cf. Preface to 3rd ed. of his Selbstzersetzung d. Christenthums.

   It is needless to adduce instances from writers of a more orthodox
   tendency.

LECTURE 2 NOTE B.--P. 44.

  THE DEFEAT OF ARIANISM.

   "The Christian doctrine has been accused," says a writer in the Church
   Quarterly Review, "of being the result of the base intrigues of
   imperial politics, and to one who resolutely looks only at the details
   of much of the controversy, such a judgment might seem natural, while a
   close acquaintance with the Byzantine Court will not make its odour
   more pleasing. But to a wider view, such a judgment is impossible. The
   decision of the Council of Nicaea was the result of the free play of
   the theological ideas of the time; for Constantine--caring little about
   the result, though caring very much for unity--wisely left to the
   Council a free hand; but its decision may very well have been owing to
   the influence of a sovereign who threw his whole weight on the side
   which he saw was prevailing. Arius was condemned by an overwhelming
   majority, but the decision of the Council was not sufficient to stamp
   out opinions which had a natural hold on a large section of the Church.
   So the reaction was obliged to spread. Arianism survived for fifty
   years; with the help of imperial patronage it even obtained an unreal
   supremacy. But it had no basis of truth, and was naturally hostile to
   Christianity. As long as it was established, it continued to exist;
   orthodoxy was oppressed and persecuted, but orthodoxy increased. As
   soon as the balance of the temporal power swung round, orthodoxy became
   supreme, and Arianism vanished from the Empire as if it had never
   existed. It had more than a fair chance, but had no basis of truth.
   Orthodoxy had a terrible fight with odds against it, but in the end it
   was completely victorious."--Church Quart., April-July 1888, pp. 462,
   463.

   Harnack's judgment on Arianism is equally severe. "Only as
   cosmologists," he says, "are the Arians monotheists; as theologians and
   in religion they are polytheists. Finally, deep contradictions lie in
   the background: a Son, who is no Son; a Logos, who is no Logos; a
   Monotheism, which does not exclude Polytheism; two or three Ousias, who
   are to be worshipped, while still only one is really distinguished from
   the creatures, an indefinable nature, which first becomes God when it
   becomes man, and which still is neither God nor man. . . . The
   opponents were right; this doctrine leads back into heathenism. . . .
   The orthodox doctrine has, on the contrary, its abiding worth in the
   upholding of the faith, that in Christ God Himself has redeemed men,
   and led them into His fellowship....This conviction of faith was saved
   by Athanasius against a doctrine which did not understand the inner
   nature of religion generally, which sought in religion only teaching,
   and ultimately found its satisfaction in an empty
   dialectic."--Grundriss d. Dogmengeschichte, m. p. 141; cf. the
   Dogmengeschichte, pp. 217-224.

   In his recent lectures on The Incarnation (p. 91), Mr. Gore directs
   attention to two striking passages from Thomas Carlyle and Thomas Hill
   Green to the same effect as the above. Mr. Froude writes of Carlyle:
   "He made one remark which is worth recording. In earlier years he had
   spoken contemptuously of the Athanasian Controversy,--of the Christian
   world torn to pieces over a diphthong....He now told me that he
   perceived Christianity itself to have been at stake. If the Arians had
   won, it would have dwindled away to a legend."--Life in London, ii. p.
   462. See Green's view in Works, iii. p. 172.

   On the later history of Arianism in England, and its transformation
   into Unitarianism, see the valuable Appendix by Dr. P. Fairbairn to
   Dorner's History of the Doctrine of the Person of Christ, vol. v. pp.
   337-466.

LECTURE 2 NOTE C.--P. 45.

  MODERN UNITARIANISM.

   The completeness with which modern Unitarianism has divested itself of
   every trace of the supernatural will be seen from the following
   extracts.

   Dr. Martineau, criticising Mr. Greg's Creed of Christendom, writes:
   "The education and habits of a refined and devout Unitarian family gave
   him the theory of life from which his independent thoughts set out.
   Outside observers, both sceptical and mystical, have always upbraided
   that theory as a weak attempt to blend incompatible elements and settle
   the contradictions of the world by a hollow compromise, while not
   denying its correspondence with a certain equilibrium of understanding
   and character. It may be described as essentially natural religion,
   enlarged and completed by a supernatural appendix. The whole of its
   theism, and half of its ethics, were within the reach of the human
   reason and conscience; but of the inner and higher range of
   morals,--spiritual purity, forgiveness of injuries, love to the
   unlovely,--the obligation was first impressed by the Christian
   Revelation. And the life beyond death, vainly pursued by the dialectic
   Plato, and claimed by the rhetoric of Cicero, became an assured reality
   with the Resurrection of Christ. The universe was a mechanical system
   of delegated causality, instituted for beneficent and righteous ends,
   and, for their better attainment, not excluding fresh intercalary
   volitions at special crises. . . . The former of these conceptions it
   cost Mr. Greg but little to modify or even to sacrifice,"
   etc.--Nineteenth Century, February 1883.

   What even Mr. Greg desires to retain of reverence for the spiritual
   perfection of Jesus, Mr. F. W. Newman, in his review of the volume,
   regards only as an amiable weakness, in total inconsistency with Mr.
   Greg's own principles of treatment of the Gospels. See passage quoted
   in Note F. to Lecture I. (from Fortnightly Review, vol. xiv.).

   In his Loss and Gain in Recent Theology (1881), Dr. Martineau sets
   himself explicitly to state the position of present-day Unitarianism;
   and the two gains he principally notices are: "the total disappearance
   from our branch of the Reformed Churches of all external authority in
   matters of religion" ("the yoke of the Bible follows the yoke of the
   Church," p. 9); [881] and, second, "the disappearance of the entire
   Messianic theology." "As objective reality, as a faithful
   representation of our invisible and ideal universe, it is gone from us,
   gone, therefore, from our interior religion, and become an outside
   mythology. From the Person of Jesus, for instance, everything official,
   attached to Him by evangelists or divines, has fallen away; when they
   put such false robes on Him, they were but leading Him to death. The
   pomp of royal lineage and fulfilled prediction, the prerogative of
   King, of Priest, of Judge, the advent with retinue of angels on the
   clouds of heaven, are to us mere deforming investitures, misplaced,
   like court dresses, on the 'spirits of the just,' and He is simply the
   Divine Flower of humanity, blossoming after ages of spiritual
   growth--the realised possibility of life in God....All that has been
   added to that real historic scene,--the angels that hang around His
   birth, and the fiend that tempts His youth; the dignities that await
   His future,--the throne, the trumpet, the assize, the bar of judgment;
   with all the apocalyptic splendours and terrors that ensue--Hades and
   the Crystal Sea, Paradise and the Infernal Gulf, nay, the very boundary
   walls of the Kosmic panorama that contains these things, have for us
   utterly melted away, and left us amid the infinite space and the silent
   stars" (pp. 14, 15).

   "Time was," says the Rev. J. W. Chadwick, of Brooklyn, "when
   Christianity was universally regarded by Unitarians as a supernatural
   revelation, attested by signs and wonders, promulgated by One who, even
   if purely human, was endowed with certain supernatural gifts, and
   perpetuated in a literature--the New Testament--whose writers were
   miraculously restrained from all erroneous statement, whether of
   doctrine or fact. These views are no longer held in their entirety by
   Unitarians. . . . There are to-day few Unitarians, if any, who believe
   in any of the New Testament miracles, from the birth of Jesus to His
   Resurrection inclusive, in the proper sense of the word
   miracles--violations of natural laws."--In a recent paper, Why I am a
   Unitarian.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [881] The late Principal Cairns observes on this: "It is important to
   remark how completely his admission bears out the whole contention of
   writers of the school opposite to his in the Socinian controversy, that
   the tendency of Unitarian doctrine and criticism was to abrogate the
   authority of Scripture, and reduce it to the level of human literature.
   This allegation was vehemently resisted in their day by the Polish
   brethren, who often put on Scripture a non-natural sense rather than
   seem to invade its authority; and in more recent times, by Priestley
   and Belsham, and other controversialists. It will be remembered that in
   the earnest debate between Moses Stuart and Channing on the Trinity,
   the former urged the latter, by the example of Continental rationalism,
   no longer to profess unlimited submission to Scripture, but to escape
   insuperable critical difficulties which arose on his side, by openly
   denying its claims to be a judge in controversy."--Art. in Catholic
   Presbyterian, November 1888.

LECTURE 2 NOTE D.--P. 47.

  CONCESSIONS OF RITSCHLIANS ON THE PERSON OF CHRIST.

   In this school, as stated in the Lectures, the attribution of Divinity
   to Christ is regarded as a simple religious judgment--a judgment of
   value--with no metaphysical meaning behind it. It simply expresses the
   value which Christ has to the believer as the Revealer of God to him in
   His grace and truth, and tells us nothing of what Christ is in Himself.
   How Christ came to be what He was, or what lies in the constitution of
   His Person behind this Revelation, it is no part of the business of
   theology to inquire. This is the original Ritschlian position, but it
   is significant that Ritschl's followers feel the need of some
   modification of it, and have already made several significant
   concessions. "It is increasingly recognised," as I have stated
   elsewhere, "that we cannot stand simply dumb before the Revelation
   which it is acknowledged we have in Christ, and refuse to ask who this
   wonderful Person is that hears the Revelation, and whose personal
   character and relation to the kingdom of God is so unique. We cannot
   rest with simply formulating the value of Christ to us; we must ask
   what He is in Himself. . . . The mind will not stay in the vagueness of
   expressions about Christ's God-head,' to which the suspicion constantly
   attaches that they are mere metaphors. Thus, in spite of their wishes,
   the Ritschlians are forced to declare themselves a little further, and
   it is significant that, so far as their explanations go, they are in
   the direction of recognising that metaphysical background in Christ's
   Person against which at first protest was entered. [882]

   Thus, in a remarkable passage in his Der Verkehr des Christen mit Gott,
   Herrmann says: "It may be unavoidable that this wonderful experience
   should excite in us the question, how a man can win this importance for
   us. And it appears to me as if, for all who wish to go back on this
   question, and follow out the representation of a union of the Divine
   and human natures in Christ, the Christological decisions of the
   ancient Church still always mark out the limits within which such
   attempts must move" (p. 46, 1st ed., 1886).

   In his earlier work, Die Religion im VerhÃ¤ltniss zum Welterkennen und
   zur Sittlichkeit, Herrmann had expressed himself, if possible, still
   more decidedly. "I have certainly the conviction," he says, "the
   grounds of which I do not need to state here further, that faith in
   Christ was led in a natural progress to the representation of a
   preexistence of Christ, and indeed of a personal, and not an ideal,
   preexistence. The assumption of a so-called ideal pre-existence seems
   to me unjustified. It is still clearly the Person of the exalted Lord,
   whose worth for the Church and for the kingdom of God is expressed by
   saying that He did not come into being under earthly conditions as we
   have done, but that, independently of the world, which represents the
   perfectly dependent sphere of His Lordship, He is. This thought finds,
   in the expression of a personal preexistence of the Lord, an expression
   very full of contradictions indeed, but still the only one which stands
   at our command, which, therefore, must also have its salutary truth.
   The contradiction will be removed, if once a solution is found of the
   problem of time, in which we now view our existence....Faith is led to
   this, to regard the Redeemer, whom it knows as the Revelation of God,
   as preexistent."--Die Religion, etc., pp. 438, 439 (1879).

   Yet more positively do Bornemann, in his Unterricht im Christenthum
   (1891), and Kaftan, in his various works, demand a real "Godhead" of
   Christ, though still with much criticism of "the old dogma," [883] and
   the repudiation of all speculative or metaphysical theologising.

   The former says: "Faith in the Godhead of Christ is in a certain sense
   the sum of the whole gospel; the aim and the whole content of the
   Christian life. Its marks are the same as those of the Godhead of the
   heavenly Father."--Unterricht, p. 91.

   Kaftan's views are most fully exhibited in his Brauchen wir ein neues
   Dogma? (1890), ("Do we need a New Dogma?").

   In a section of this pamphlet, under the heading, "What think says:
   "Man ye of Christ?" he says: "Many will object that all has no basis
   and no guarantee of truth, if it is not established that Jesus has His
   origin and the beginning of His earthly life from above, and not from
   below. And in this lies something, the truth of which cannot be
   gainsaid, At least it is in my view also a consequence we cannot refuse
   of faith in the Godhead of the Lord, that He, that His historical
   Person, stands in a connection of nature with God perfectly unique and
   not capable of being repeated. We know not how we can call a man
   God,'--the word is too great and too weighty,--if we do not truly mean
   that the eternal God Himself has come to us in Him, and in Him
   converses with us....Do we believe in the Godhead of the Lord, then we
   believe also in His origin from above, out of God."--Brauchen wir,
   etc., p. 58. Cf. the statements in his original work, Des Wesen, etc.,
   pp. 308 ff. (1st ed.).

   This movement cannot fail to go further, and work itself into clearer
   relations with the old dogma which it condemns. [884]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [882] Art. on "The Ritschlian Theology," in The Thinker, August 1892.

   [883] The contrast between the "old" and the "new" is expressed by
   Kaftan thus: "The eternal relation of Jesus Christ to the Father is in
   the old dogma the peculiar and whole object of the doctrine; it accords
   with evangelical Christianity, on the other hand, to know His Godhead
   in its living present relations to us and to our faith" (Brauchen wir,
   etc., p. 54). But this is not an absolute opposition, nor are the
   standpoints necessarily exclusive.

   [884] Wendt, on the other hand, in his Inhalt der Lehre Jesu, refuses
   to see in Jesus anything but an ethical Sonship (pp. 450-476).

LECTURE 2 NOTE E.--P. 48.

  THE WEAKNESS OF DEISM.

   The weakness of Deism as a logical system is universally conceded.
   "Deism," says M. Reville, "in sound philosophy is not tenable. It
   establishes a dualism, a veritable opposition, between God and the
   world, which stand opposite to and limit each other. . . . A reaction,
   in fact, was inevitable. It was necessary that it should be at the same
   time philosophical and religious, and should come to the satisfaction
   of the needs that had been misunderstood and suppressed. In philosophy
   Deism could no longer hold up its head against the objections of
   reason. In religion, every one was wearied of optimism and of empty
   declamations. Deism removed God so far from the world and from humanity
   that piety exhausted itself in the endeavour to rejoin Him in the icy
   heights of heaven, and ended by, renouncing the attempt."--La DivinitÃ©
   de JÃ©sus-Christ, pp. 163, 171. Again: "The eighteenth century little
   imagined that natural religion, the religion which humanity was bound
   to profess in this age of idyllic virtue, in which le contrat social
   had been elaborated before it was corrupted by the artifices of priests
   and kings, was nothing else but philosophic Deism. It did not perceive
   that this pretended natural religion was merely an extract subtly
   derived from Christian tradition, the fruit of a civilisation already
   old and artificial, already saturated with criticism and rationalism,
   quite the opposite of a religion springing up spontaneously in the
   human mind still influenced by its primitive traditions."--History of
   Religions, p. 14 (Eng. trans.).

   Professor Seth has said: "Deism does not perceive that, by separating
   God from the world and man, it really makes Him finite, by setting up
   alongside of Him a sphere to which His relations are transient and
   accidental. The philosopher to whom the individual self and the
   sensible world form the first reality, gradually comes to think of this
   otiose Deity as a more or less ornamental appendage in the scheme of
   things. In France, the century ended in atheism; and in cosmopolitan
   circles in England and Germany, the belief in God had become little
   more than a form of words."--From Kant to Hegel, p. 24.

   "The philosophic rationalism of the vulgar Aufklarung," says Hartmann,
   "appeared with the claim to set up in place of the disesteemed
   historical religions a self-evident natural religion' or religion of
   reason' for all men, the content of which was first a shallow Deism,
   wills its trinity of ideas of a personal God, personal immortality, and
   personal freedom of will; but already in the circles of the French
   Encyclopaedists this spiritless Deism had struck over into an equally
   spiritless materialism."--Religionsphilosophie, ii. p. 24.

  WEAKNESS OF MODERN LIBERAL PROTESTANTISM.

   The modern Liberal Protestantism in Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and
   France, which, while discarding the supernatural in history, still
   retains the name Christian,--nay, claims to be the true Christianity,
   purified and brought into harmony with the "modern" spirit.--meets with
   scant mercy at the hands of those who have gone further, who ruthlessly
   strip off the veil which disguises its essential rationalism.
   Pfleiderer and Reville may be named us well-known representatives. The
   party, while claiming the right to criticise and reject every article
   of the creed, would retain the traditional forms of worship, and
   delight, even, to clothe their conceptions in the familiar forms of the
   traditional dogmatics. It is thus that a service of the "moderns" is
   described by one of their own number. "Only put yourself," says this
   witness, "in the position of those who had never received any other
   teaching, for example, than that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary, and
   suddenly heard their pastor speak on some Christmas Day of 'simple
   parents of the man of Nazareth,' or on Easter Sunday of the delusion of
   the early Christians that Jesus has returned to earth from the
   grave.'...Yet such preaching was actually heard....The Church listened,
   thought it over, thought it over again, and finally a large number of
   her members accepted the new teaching" (quoted by Wicksteed, Eccl.
   Instit. of Holland, p. 59). It is the glaring inconsistency of this
   position which is remorselessly satirised by writers hike Strauss amid
   Hartmann, and the timing which gives their strictures sharpness is that
   there is so much truth in them.

   There was a time when Strauss also wrote: "But we have no fear that we
   should lose Christ by being obliged to give up a considerable part of
   what was hitherto called the Christian creed! He will remain to all of
   us the more surely, the less anxiously we cling to doctrines and
   opinions that might tempt our reason to forsake Him. But if Christ
   remains to us, and if He remains to us as the highest we know and are
   capable of imagining within the sphere of religion, as the Person
   without whose presence in the mind an perfect piety is possible; we may
   fairly say that in Him do we still possess the sum and substance of the
   Christian faith" (SelbstgesprÃ¤che, p.67, Eng. trans.). But in his The
   Old Faith and the New Strauss later faced the question "Are we still
   Christians?" with a bolder look, and gave it the uncompromising answer,
   "No." He goes over the articles of the Apostles' Creed one by one, and
   shows that every one of theism is taken by the "modern" theologians in
   a non-natural sense. He invites his reader "to assist in thought at the
   cycle of festivals in a Protestant church, whose minister stands on the
   ground of present day science, and see whether he can still he
   uprightly and naturally edified thereby." He pictures the statements
   that such a minister would be compelled to make at Christmas, at the
   Epiphany, at Good Friday, at Easter and Ascension Day; compares them
   with the book he reads, the prayers he uses, the sacraments he
   administers; and shows how completely the whole thing is a ludicrous
   pretence. His conclusion is: "If we do not wish to escape difficulties,
   if we do not wish to twist and dissemble, if we wish our yea to be yea,
   and our nay, nay,--in short, if we would speak as honourable, upright
   men,--we must confess, we are no longer Christians."--Der alte und der
   neue Glaube, pp. 12-94.

   Hartmann is even more severe on the unchristian character of the modern
   Protestant Liberalism in his Selbstzersetzung des Christenthums (chaps.
   vi. and vii.). "We ask," he says, "what right the Protestant Liberals
   have to call themselves Christians beyond the fact that their parents
   have had them baptised and confirmed. In all ages there has been one
   common mark of the Christian religion--belief in Christ. . . . But we
   have seen that the Liberal Protestants cannot believe in Christ as
   either Luther, or Thomas Aquinas, or John or Paul, or Peter, believed
   in Christ, and least of all as Jesus believed in Himself, for He
   believed Himself to be the Christ--the Messiah" (pp. 64, 65).

   Apart, however, from criticisms of opponents, which may be deemed
   unfair, it is a fact that, through all its history, Protestant
   Liberalism has found it exceedingly difficult to maintain itself on the
   platform even of Theism, not to speak of that of Christianity . Its
   tendency has been constantly "downgrade," till either it has ended in
   open rejection of Christianity, or has been displaced by more. positive
   forms of belief. Strauss's case is not a solitary one. A parallel is
   found in the career of Edmond Scherer, the inaugurator of the modern
   Liberal movement in Switzerland and France, who, beginning with the
   most uncompromising traditional orthodoxy, went on, according to M.
   Gretillat, to the progressive repudiation of all the fundamentals of
   Christian belief, religious and even moral, up to the point of absolute
   scepticism. The party of Liberal Christianity initiated by him, of
   which Reville is a surviving representative, had, according to the same
   authority, "only a fleeting existence,' and its name, to speak in
   popular language, soon disappeared from the handbill" [885] (article on
   "Theological Thought among. French Protestants" in Presbyt. and Ref.
   Review, July 1892). In Holland, too, the "modern" school is seen
   running a remarkable course. Its originator, Scholten, was at first,
   like Scherer of Geneva, quite conservative. Then he passed to a view of
   Revelation and of Christianity not unlike Pfleiderer's. His "thoughts,
   however, were not expounded with perfect distinctness in the beginning.
   They were too much clothed in the old orthodox forms, and had too large
   an admixture of conservative elements f or this. Scholten himself lived
   in the honest conviction of having discovered the reconciliation of
   faith and knowledge, of theology and philosophy, of the heart and the
   intellect. He was able also to impart this conviction to others. Soon
   the gospel was proclaimed with enthusiasm from many pulpits . . . .
   Among his followers the illusion was well-nigh universal, that the
   reasonableness of the faith and of the doctrine of the Reformed Church
   had been established." This confidence received a rude shock when, in
   1864, Scholten himself declared that, while formerly believing that he
   found in the Scriptures, rightly expounded, his view of the world, he
   was no longer of that opinion. "He now begins to recognise that between
   his ideas and those of the Bible there is no agreement, but a deep
   chasm. . . . The results soon showed themselves. The illusion had been
   dispelled; faith and enthusiasm suffered shipwreck. Some ministers,
   like Pierson and Busken Huet, resigned the office and left the Church.
   Others felt dissatisfied with the monism of Scholten. . . . A whole
   group of modern theologians broke loose from Scholten's system, and
   sought a closer alliance with Hoekstra. . . . Some adherents of this
   tendency went to such an extreme in the avowal of these ideas, that,
   with a degree of justice, an atheistic shade' of modern theology began
   to be spoken of."--Professor Bavinck, of Kampen, in Presbyt. and Ref.
   Review, April 1892.

   Professor Bavinck thus sums up on the development in Holland: "In
   casting a retrospective glance at the three tendencies described up to
   this point, we are struck with the tragic aspect of this development of
   dogmatic thought. It is a slow process of dissolution that meets our
   view. It began with setting aside the Confession. Scripture alone n-as
   to be heard. Next, Scripture also is dismissed, and the Person of
   Christ is fallen back on. Of this Person, however, first His Divinity,
   next His pre-existence, finally His sinlessness, are surrendered, and
   nothing remains but a pious man, a religious genius, revealing to us
   the love of Cod. But even the existence and love of God are not able to
   withstand criticism. Thus the moral element in man becomes the last
   basis from which the battle against Materialism is conducted. But this
   basis will appear to be as unstable and unreliable as the others."

  CHRISTIANITY AND THE IDEA OF PROGRESS.

   "The hopeful view of human history," says Professor J. Candlish,
   "according to which there is to be expected a gradual progress in an
   upward direction, and an ultimate state of goodness and happiness, was
   entirely foreign to the ideas of the ancient world. Its philosophers
   and poets either regarded the course of mankind as a continual
   degeneracy from a golden age in the past, or as a vast cycle in which
   there was a continual return or reproduction of the same events and
   states of things. . . . The idea of the perfectibility of mankind, and
   of the gradual and steady improvement of the race in the course of
   time, which has been so largely used by those who reject Christianity,
   and which enables them to make light of the supernatural grounds of
   hope for the world that Christians cherish, was entirely strange to the
   pre-Christian ages; and though it may be due in part to the progress of
   science, yet is much more to he ascribed to the promises and truths of
   Revelation, At least it may be said with truth that Christianity, and
   more particularly the Christian idea of the kingdom of God, furnishes
   the only solid ground for such hopes of mankind. . . . In modern times
   the discoveries of science in its investigation of the works of
   creation have tended to awaken in men's minds a similar hopeful spirit,
   so that the gradual and sure advance of mankind to perfection has been
   accepted almost as an axiom or self-evident truth by many who do not
   accept the religious basis on which it rested in Israel. But it may be
   doubted whether, apart from a belief in God as the Creator of the
   universe, and at the same time the God of grace and salvation, there is
   any solid foundation for such a hopeful view of the world's history.
   The rise and prevalence of pessimistic views in modern times serves to
   show this; and some of those who are most sanguine about the prospects
   of mankind, apart from Revelation and Christianity, acknowledge frankly
   that there can be no certainty of this on a merely natural basis, and
   that possibly after all we may have to fall back into Pessimism."--The
   Kingdom of God (Cunningham Lectures, 1884), pp. 38-42.

   See on this subject the careful history of the idea of progress in
   Flint's Philosophy of History, Pp. 28-42; and the valuable remarks in
   Hare's Guesses at Truth (referred to also by Dr. Candlish), pp. 305-348
   (1871). Cf. Leopardi's (and Hartmann's) three stages of human illusion,
   in Caro's Le Pessimisme, pp. 39-49.

  THE PREVALENCE OF PESSIMISM.

   "It is a singular phenomenon," says Luthardt, "that in our time, in
   which so much complaint is made of the decay of philosophical study and
   interest, a definite philosophical system has attained a popularity
   which is almost without precedent in earlier systems; and a
   philosophical work has had a success which usually falls only to the
   lot of the most spirited literary works, and to romances. I refer to
   the philosophy of Pessimism and to the work of E. von Hartmann, The
   Philosophy of the Unconscious."--Die mod. Welt. p. 183.

   Caro observes: "We can now understand in what sense, and how far it is
   true that the disease of Pessimism is a disease essentially modern.'
   [886] . . . How strange this revival of Buddhistic Pessimism, with all
   the apparatus of the most learned systems, in the heart of Prussia, at
   Berlin! That three hundred millions of Asiatics should drink in long
   draughts the opium of these fatal doctrines which enervate and act as a
   soporific on the will, is already sufficiently strange; but that a
   race, energetic, disciplined, so strongly constituted for knowledge and
   for action, at the same time so practical, a rigorous calculator,
   warlike and stern, certainly the opposite of a sentimental race,--that
   a nation formed of these robust and lively elements should give a
   triumphant welcome to these theories of despair divulged by
   Schopenhauer,--that its military optimism should accept with a sort of
   enthusiasm the apology for death and for annihilation,--it is this
   which at the first view seems inexplicable. And the success of the
   doctrine is not confined to the banks of the Spree. The whole of
   Germany has become attentive to this movement of ideas. Italy, with a
   great poet, had outstripped the current; France, as we shall see, has
   followed in a certain measure; she also, at the present hour, has her
   Pessimists."--Le Pessimisme, pp. 25, 26. "There can be no question,"
   says Karl Peters, "that Schopenhauerism is for the time the dominating
   tendency in our fatherland. One needs only to consult Laban's book-list
   to be convinced of the fact; our whole atmosphere is, so to speak,
   saturated with Schopenhauer's views and ideas. . . . Hand in hand with
   the colossal forward development of our race in all departments goes
   the fact that the sorrow of earthly existence is felt to-day more
   keenly than ever by the masses. A decided pessimistic current goes
   through our time."--Willenswelt, pp. 109, 244.

   Pessimism, according to Hartmann, is the deeper mood of humanity--its
   permanent undertone (Selbstzer. d. Christ. p. 96).

  TRANSITION FROM PESSIMISM TO THEISM--HARTMANN AND KARL PETERS.

   It is a remarkable circumstance that Pessimism also should end by
   recognising the need of religion, and in its own way should be found
   seeking to provide for that need. The new religion, Hartmann thinks,
   will represent the synthesis of the religious evolution of the East and
   of that of the West--of the pantheistic and of the monotheistic
   evolution: only resting on that which is the indispensable
   presupposition of all religion, "the Pessimism of positive
   Christianity." He describes it as "a Pantheism, and indeed a
   pantheistic Monism (with exclusion of all Polytheism); or impersonal
   immanent Monotheism, whose Godhead has the word as its objective
   manifestation, not outside of, but within itself" (Selbst. d. Christ.
   pp. 93, 97, 121). The basis of this new religious system is elaborated
   in the second part of his Religionsphilosophie, entitled Die Religion
   des Geistes. A simple reference to the table of contents in this work
   will show in how extraordinary a fashion it is attempted to take over
   the whole nomenclature of Christianity into this new philosophical
   religion. First the human side of the religious relation is treated of,
   often very suggestively. Then it is treated of in its double-sided
   aspect--Divine and human--under the following headings--(1) Grace and
   Faith in General; (2) The Grace of Revelation and Intellectual Faith;
   (3) The Grace of Redemption and Faith of the Heart; (4) The Grace of
   Sanctification and Practical Faith. The object of religion in turn is
   considered in a threefold aspect--(l) God as the Moment overcoming the
   Dependency of the World; (2) God as the Moment grounding the Dependency
   of the World; (3) God as the Moment grounding the Freedom of the World
   (Freedom in God, the righteousness of God the holiness of God). Man is
   considered--(1) as in need of Redemption; and (2) as capable of
   Redemption. The process of salvation itself is exhibited in a threefold
   light--(1) The Awakening of Grace; (2) The Unfolding of Grace; (3) The
   Fruits of Grace (!). Yet God, endowed with all these attributes, wise,
   omniscient, gracious, righteous, holy, etc., is still regarded as
   impersonal and unconscious. Is not Hartmann chargeable with the same
   fault which he seeks to fasten on the Protestant Liberals, of trying to
   profit by the respect which is paid to the Bible while teaching a
   totally different doctrine? (Selbst. d. Christ. p. 62).

   Karl Peters is undoubtedly right, when he says of the systems both of
   Frauenstadt and of Hartmann, that they represent the transition to
   Theism without knowing it. In Frauenstadt's system, he remarks, "the
   world in its totality is no more identified with the world-Ego, and we
   have, without being aware of it, gone over from Pantheism to Theism."
   Criticising Hartmann, be comments on "this absolute, unconscious,
   all-wise idea , an omniscient wisdom, which embraces all, and only
   knows not itself," and argues that in principle Theism is involved in
   Hartmann's doctrine. "Here," he says, "we reach the kernel of the whole
   criticism. I maintain, namely, positively, that the Philosophy of the
   Unconscious represents the transition from Pantheism to Theism. . . .
   As in Schopenhauer we have the transition from an idealistic to a
   realistic, so in Hartmann there is executed the transition from a
   pantheistic to a theistic Weltanschauung.' The former indeed believed
   himself to stand on quite the other side, and no doubt the latter also
   thinks that he is planted on the opposite bank. But as Schopenhauer
   could not prevent the historical development from growing beyond his
   standpoint, so Hartmann will seek in vain to guard himself against such
   a breaking up of his system....Ed v. Hartmann's Unconscious is an
   almighty and all-wise Providence, raised above the world-process, which
   comprehends and holds within itself the whole
   world-development."--Willenswelt, pp. 148, 268, 272.

  MATERIALISM IN GERMANY.

   The descent from an overstrained idealistic Pantheism to materialistic
   Atheism in Germany--through Feuerbach, Stirner, lingo, etc.--is matter
   of notoriety. The following extract from an able article on "Lotze's
   Theistic Philosophy," in the Presbyterian Review, vol. vi. (1885), will
   illustrate the length to which things went in that direction:--"The
   one-sided opposition of Empiricism to Idealism developed into dogmatic
   Materialism. From the 18th September 1854, when Rudolf Wagner delivered
   at GÃ¶ttingen his famous address on The Creation of Man and the
   Substance of the Soul,' the Materialistic conflict raged in Germany for
   a couple of decades with unabated vigour. Taking up the gauntlet which
   Wagner had thrown down Karl Vogt entered the lists with Kohlerglaube
   und Wissenschaft,' flaunting, amidst satire and ridicule, in the face
   of his opponent, who had declared himself content with the simple
   religious faith of the collier, the new famous sentence that thought
   stands in about the same relation to the brain, as gall to the liver or
   urine to the kidneys.' A flood of writings, more or less popular in
   style, followed, and a sort of religious propaganda was made of the
   gospel of Materialism, while a fierce crusade was waged against
   everything claiming to be superior to matter, or a function of matter.
   The hostility against religion was pronounced and bitter. The creed
   preached was Atheism, naked and unashamed. Matter is held to be
   eternal; physical and chemical forces are the only ultimate agents; the
   world exists, Vogt tells us, without organic substance, without a known
   Creator, nay, without a leading idea.' Hellwald expressly announces
   that the task of science is to destroy all ideals, to manifest their
   hollowness and nothingness, to show that belief in God and religion is
   deception'; while Buchner, who is ever, if possible, a little more
   audacious than the rest, sums up the matter as follows: Theism, or
   belief in a personal God, leads, as all history shows, to monachism,
   and the rule of priests; Pantheism, or belief in an all-pervading God,
   leads, where it is in the ascendancy, to contempt of the senses, denial
   of the Ego , to absorption in God, and to a state of stagnation.
   Atheism, or philosophical Monism, alone leads to freedom, to
   intelligence, to progress, to due recognition of man--in a word, to
   Humanism.' . . . The progress of Materialism was rapid. Buchner's Force
   and Matter, the Bible of German Materialism,' passed, within twenty
   years from its first appearance (1858), through no less than fourteen
   editions, and was translated into almost every language in Europe. The
   scientific camp was said to be materialistic almost to a man. The
   common people, among whom this way of thinking was frequently allied
   with the political tenets of social democracy, were, and are still
   to-day largely leavened by the infection. The philosophical chairs in
   the Universities were feeble to resist it. . . . Materialism in Germany
   is no longer as strong as it was; good authorities express it as their
   opinion that, as it grew, so also is it waning rapidly " (pp. 652-655).

   See also the sketch of the German atheistic parties in Lichtenberger's
   "History of German Theology in the Nineteenth Century" (Histoire des
   IdÃ©es religieuses en Allemagne), pp. 360-70 (Eng. trans.); and
   Christlieb's "Modern Doubt and Christian Belief" (Moderne Zweifel am
   christlichen Glaube), pp. 138-140 (Eng. trans.).

  THE REASONABLENESS OF REVELATION.

   Ewald has said, much in the spirit of the passage quoted from
   Pfleiderer: "How, then, should not He answer the earnestly
   perseveringly questioning spirit of man--He of whose spirit man's is
   but a luminous reflection and an enkindled spark, and to whom in his
   searching and questioning he ran draw near quite otherwise than to the
   visible things of creation."--Revelation: its Nature and Record (Eng.
   trans. of first vol. of Die Lehre der Bibel von Gott), p. 18.

   Dr. Walter Morison works out in a very ingenious way the argument for
   the probability and reasonableness of Revelation from the analogy of
   nature. Rebutting the objection that the modern conception of nature
   "is altogether against the idea of any interference by Revelation from
   Heaven with the closely linked order existing in nature," and permits
   "only evolution from within of coiled--up energies," he remarks: "In
   whatever way--whether by evolution or otherwise--the system of nature
   which we see around us, and of which we are a part, has come about,
   that system of nature supplies no presumption against there being a
   direct Revelation of religious truth; on the contrary, its actual
   testimony, rightly understood, is in favour of that supposition. What
   may be called direct revelation is found to he one of the common
   phenomena of nature or the system of things. As soon as we pass into
   that region in our world where there is need for communication between
   individuals possessed of intelligence in any degree, we find
   revelation' to be the law. There is direct utterance. Even the inferior
   animals are continually telling out by their many voices, none of which
   is without signification,' their various feelings. Wherever there is
   what may be called individuality, with power of feeling and volition,
   there utterance or communication exists; it being part of the order of
   nature that there be connecting bond of speech between such as possess
   any faculty for understanding and fellowship. And when we ascend in our
   observations to the region of human life as social, we perceive a
   corresponding development of the powers noticed in the inferior
   creatures. Everywhere over society we observe speech of some sort;
   communication in a direct way from one to another; a constant immediate
   revelation of inward thought and feeling going on. There is really
   nothing more familiar in the economy of human life than this phenomenon
   of direct communication from mind to mind, sometimes by look and sight,
   usually by words. . . . There is another world, then, besides this
   tongueless one of inorganic nature! There is in the universe this fact,
   that between individuals capable of it, direct revelation is constantly
   going on. Where there are beings that require a medium of intelligent
   communication between them, there we perceive some sort of speech to
   exist. And hence it is not a suggestion prima facie opposed to the
   analogy of nature, at all events, which is offered when it is asked
   whether there may not be some direct personal and articulate utterance
   made by God to man. Is there to he eternal silence between these
   intelligences, these kindred natures, with their mutual capacity for
   love and communion? Are all creatures in the universe that have any
   measure of intelligence, or are even sentient, capable of telling out
   directly what is in them; and have they the means and the appetency
   thereto? Can man commune with man through the high gift of language?
   And is the Infinite Mind and Heart not to express itself, or is it to
   do so but faintly or uncertainly through dumb material symbols, never
   by blessed speech? Is there no Word of God'? To give a negative answer
   here would be at least to go against the analogy of nature. All beings
   that we know possessed of any intelligence,--such beings generally, we
   can at all events say,--and especially the members of the human family,
   speak to each other in some direct way, make an immediate revelation of
   what is within them; and one of the strongest presumptions, surely, is
   this, that a Personal God, in whose image man was made, would, in His
   dealings with man, if sufficient occasion called, express Himself in a
   similar direct manner; in other words, give a Revelation!"--Footprints
   of the Revealer, pp. 49-52.

NOTE L.--P. 64.

  THE RITSCHLIAN DOCTRINE OF REVELATION.

   The Ritschlian theologians found everything on positive Revelation.
   This is their distinctive position, and their merit as a protest
   against a one-sided intellectualism and idealism. They will not allow
   even of the possibility of any knowledge of God outside the Revelation
   of His grace in Jesus Christ. [887] Natural theology and theoretic
   proofs for the existence of God are tabooed by them. A few remarks
   maybe made here on this theory byway of further explanation and
   criticism.

   I. On the theory itself:--

   1. As regards the nature of this Revelation, the Ritschlians are agreed
   that it comes to us solely through the self-presentation of Christ in
   His historical manifestation. He is the only vehicle of Revelation
   recognised by them. It is not a Revelation through doctrine, but
   through the felt presence of God in Christ, and through the living and
   acting in which Christ exemplifies to us the right relation of sonship
   to God, and makes manifest the character and purposes of God, as these
   bear on our salvation and well-being.

   2. As regards the content of this Revelation, its central point is
   found in the design of God to found a kingdom of God on the earth, and
   to gather men into it, and induce them to make its ends their own,
   through the right knowledge of His character, and their acceptance of
   the right relation of sonship to Him. All Christ's work--His doing and
   dying--has this for its aim. His unity with God in His world-purpose is
   a feature in His Divinity; the significance of His death is, that it
   guarantees to us supremely the reality of that religious relation to
   God into which He invites us in His Gospel. [888]

   3. As regards the proof of this Revelation, the Ritschlians are
   obviously in a difficulty, since proof means that a thing is shown to
   be objectively true (apart from our subjective thoughts about it),
   while yet it is a cardinal principle with them that religion moves only
   in the sphere of value-judgments, i.e. judgments on the relation of
   things to our states of pleasure and pain. They cannot, however, refuse
   the demand for proof that this which they present as Revelation from
   God is really such, and not a subjective illusion of our own minds. And
   here--

   First, and negatively, they reject, as inappropriate to religion, all
   merely historical evidence, or proof from objective facts, as miracles,
   or the resurrection of Christ (which it is doubtful if most of them
   accept as objective fact).

   Second, and positively, the proof alleged is of two kinds:--

   (l) Immediate--consisting of the irresistible impression (Eindruck)
   which Christ makes on the soul historically confronted with Him,
   compelling the acknowledgment that God is with Him. This is the theme
   on which the changes are incessantly rung by Professor Herrmann in his
   recent writings.

   (2) Scientific--consisting in showing the correspondence which exists
   between Christianity and the religious needs of man, as these may be
   deduced from the consideration of his nature and history; otherwise,
   the agreement of Christianity with the practical postulates of
   religion. This is the sort of proof which Ritschl hints at when he
   says: "Its representation in theology will, therefore, come to a
   conclusion in the proof that the Christian ideal of life, and no other,
   altogether satisfies the claims of the human spirit to a knowledge of
   things"; i.e. yields a practically satisfying view of the world (Recht.
   und Ver. iii. p. 25, 3rd ed.); and which is undertaken in detail by
   Kaftan in his Wahrheit d. Christ. Religion (though on different
   fundamental lines from Ritschl's).

   II. On this view I would offer the following brief criticisms:--

   1. It is to be observed that this basing of everything by the

   Ritschlians on positive Revelation does not harmonise well with the
   premises of the school.

   (l) It does not consist well with their fundamental position that
   religion moves solely in the sphere of value-judgments. For if we
   really get out to objective Revelation, we have clearly broken through
   this magic circle of value-judgments, and are in the domain of
   judgments of fact and truth. Or is our judgment that this is a Divine
   Revelation itself also only a value-judgment?

   (2) The theory of Revelation does not consist well with the Ritschlian
   theory of knowledge. For Ritschl is thoroughly at one with Kant in the
   view that the theoretic reason can give us no knowledge of God, or
   proof of His existence. We are thus driven back on practical
   postulates, or "Vorstellungen," beyond which, as it would seem, even
   Revelation cannot raise us, for Revelation cannot take us outside the
   essential limitations of our faculties.

   2. It is to be observed, further, that this theory has no proper answer
   to give to the question of the nature of Revelation. With its general
   avoidance of the speculative, it gives us no distinct specification of
   what precisely this term means, or how much it is supposed to cover.
   Enough that we receive from Christ the impression that--in some
   undefined sense--God is with Him, and in Him is drawing near to us;
   this is to us (subjectively) the Revelation, and nothing else is of
   importance. Yet it is very obvious that multitudes of questions may
   arise just at this point as to the character, degree, purity, limits,
   reliableness, and authority of this Revelation, which Ritschlianism
   gives us no help to answer. We cannot but ask, e.g., respecting a
   Revelation mediated to us in this way through the consciousness of
   another human being--How did it originate? What did Revelation mean to
   Him, the original recipient? Was it a really supernatural act? or
   partly supernatural and partly natural, with a correspondingly mixed
   result? How is such a Revelation even possible, since, according to
   another part of the theory, there is no direct (mystical) communication
   between the soul and God? [889] Is there not large room left here,
   which the Ritschlian (e.g. Wendt) are not slow to avail themselves of,
   for distinction and criticism even in the contents of Christ's own
   consciousness and utterances? Are we not in danger of coming hack to
   the view that in the last analysis Christ's religious conceptions do
   not differ in origin or character from those of any other great
   religious genius?

   3. It is again to be observed that the character of this system compels
   it to limit very greatly the contents of the Revelation. Ritschlianism
   is, as said, essentially a system of religious positivism. It starts
   with data of experience,--the direct impression made on us by Christ,
   and the experimental knowledge we have of His power to give us
   deliverance and freedom,--and beyond this it declines to go. All in the
   Christian system which it regards as transcendental or
   metaphysical--however guaranteed by words of Christ or His Apostles--it
   refuses to inquire into, or sets aside as of no importance to faith.
   The pre-existence of Christ, e.g., His supernatural birth, His heavenly
   reign, the constitution of His Person, the Trinity of the Godhead, the
   eschatological doctrines, are thus swept aside. It has no doctrine of
   objective Atonement, but only one of subjective reconciliation. Other
   great doctrines of Scripture are either absent, or have a large part of
   their meaning taken from them.

   4. Finally, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, while the
   members of this school profess to derive their theology from positive
   Revelation, what really governs their construction is, not the
   objective Revelation, but their particular theories of religion, and
   their ideas of what is necessary for the realisation of man's practical
   ends. Every one of the members of this school has his theory of
   religion independently determined (the theories, however, widely
   differing from each other), and agreement with this theory is not only
   employed for the proof of the Revelation, but is also the standard,
   practically, of what is accepted or rejected in its contents. The
   Revelation, in other words, does not come with authority, but rather
   derives it's authority from its agreement with the practical
   postulates, which are previously established on quite other grounds.
   This is true of all the leading members of the party--Ritschl.
   Herrmann, Kaftan, etc. So far as relates to the proof of Revelation, it
   is not easy to avoid the appearance of moving in a circle. E.g., in
   Kaftan's Wahrheit, while the test of the truth of the Revelation is its
   agreement with the practical postulates above referred to, these in
   turn are supposed to he confirmed by the fact of the Revelation, and
   thus proved to he no subjective illusion. I would not press this too
   far, since the argument from agreement with rational and moral
   postulates is in itself a sound one, and the only objection that can be
   raised is to the particular way of stating it, and the exclusive use
   made of it. [890]

   [888] Kaftan, however, views the kingdom of God as belonging. not to
   this world, but the next.

   reduce it to a nucleus of moral notions.

LECTURE 3 NOTE A.--P. 75.

  PRIMITIVE FETISHISM AND GHOST-WORSHIP.

   The theory of a gradual ascent in religion from a primitive Fetishism
   through . Polytheism to Monotheism, made familiar by Auguste Comte, and
   repeated with unquestioning faith by writers like Mr. Clodd and Mr. S.
   Laing, receives scant countenance from the best recent authorities.
   Certainly, no case has been found in which it is possible to trace
   historically such an evolution. I cite a few statements and opinions on
   the subject, and on the rival theories of Ghost-worship, Totemism, etc.

   Principal Fairbairn, speaking of this class of theories in general,
   says: "They assume a theory of development which has not a single
   historical instance to verify it. Examples are wanted of people who
   have grown, without foreign influence, from Atheism into Fetishism, and
   from it through the intermediate stages into Monotheism; and until such
   examples be given, hypotheses claiming to be Natural Histories of
   Religion' must be judged hypotheses still."--Studies in the Philosophy
   of Religion, p. 12.

   Mr. Max Miller, speaking as an expert, condemns the theory of a
   primitive Fetishism. He says: "If it has never been proved, and
   perhaps, according to the nature of the case, can never be proved, that
   Fetishism in Africa, or elsewhere, was ever in any sense of the word a
   primary form of religion, neither has it been shown that Fetishism
   constituted anywhere, whether in Africa or elsewhere, the whole of a
   people's religion. Though our knowledge of the religion of the negroes
   is still very imperfect, yet I believe I may say that, wherever there
   has been an opportunity of ascertaining, by long and patient
   intercourse, the religious sentiments even of the lowest savage tribes,
   no tribe has ever been found without something beyond mere worship of
   fetishes. . . . I maintain that Fetishism was a corruption of religion
   in Africa, as elsewhere; that the negro is capable of higher religious
   ideas than the worship of stocks and stones; and that many tribes who
   believe in fetishes cherish at the same time very pure, very exalted,
   and very true sentiments of the Deity."--Is Fetishism a Primitive Form
   of Religion? Lecture II. p. 105 (Hibbert Lectures).

   In his more recent Lectures he reiterates this view: "If one
   considers," he says, "what Fetishism really is, namely, the very last
   stage in the downward course of religion, this attempt to make a
   little-understood superstition of some modern negro tribes the key to
   the religion of Greeks and Romans, nay of the most civilised nations of
   the world, is perfectly marvellous--Natural Religion, p. 159. Again:
   "Fetishism, from its very nature, cannot be primitive, because it
   always presupposes the previous growth of the Divine predicate. As to
   the Fetishism of modern negroes, we know now that it represents the
   very lowest stage which religion can reach, whether in Africa or any
   other part of the world; and I know of no case, even among the most
   degraded of negro tribes, where remnants of a higher religious belief
   have not been discovered by the side of this degraded belief in
   amulets, talismans, and fetishes. The idea of De Brosses and his
   followers, that Fetishism could reveal to us the very primordia of
   religious thought, will remain for ever one of the strangest cases of
   self-delusion, and one of the boldest anachronisms committed by
   students of the history of religions."--Ibid. pp. 219, 220.

   Mr. Herbert Spencer passes the same judgment. Repudiating Mr.
   Harrison's theory of an original Fetishism, he says: "An induction,
   based on over a hundred examples, warrants me in saying that there has
   never existed anywhere such a religion as that which Mr. Harrison
   ascribes to countless millions of men,' during countless centuries of
   time.' . . . I have shown that, whereas among the lowest races, such as
   the Juangs, Andamanese, Fuegians, Australians, Tasmanians, and Bushmen,
   there is no Fetishism, Fetishism reaches its greatest height in
   considerably advanced societies, like those of ancient Peru and modern
   India. . . . And I have remarked that, had Fetishism been conspicuous
   among the lowest races, and inconspicuous among the higher, the
   statement that it was primordial might have been held proved; but that,
   as the fact happens to be exactly the opposite, the statement is
   conclusively disproved--Nineteenth Century, xvi. pp. 8, 9.

   This also is Pfleiderer's opinion: "In presence of these facts, the
   evolution theory,' as hitherto stated, which finds the beginnings of
   religion in Fetishism and Animism, appears to me to he as much wanting
   in evidence as it is psychologically
   impossible."--Religionsphilosophie, lii. p. 16 (Eng. trans.).

   But then Mr.. Spencer's Ghost theory, which he (and now also Dr. Tyler)
   propounds as a substitute for that of a primitive Fetishism, meets with
   an equally decisive rejection at the hands of Mr. Harrison, Max Muller,
   and other influential writers. "I shall say but little about Mr.
   Spencer's Ghost theory," says Mr. Harrison; "I have always held it to
   be one of the most unlucky of all his sociologic doctrines, and that on
   psychological as well as on historical grounds. . . . It is certain
   that the believers in the Ghost theory, as the origin of all forms of
   religion, are few and far between. The difficulties in the way of it
   are enormous. Mr. Spencer laboriously tries to persuade us that the
   worship of the sun and the moon arose, not from man's reverence for
   these great and beautiful powers of nature, but solely as they were
   thought to be the abodes of the disembodied spirits of dead ancestors.
   Animal worship, tree amid plant worship, Fetishism, the Confucian
   worship of heaven--all, he would have us believe, take their religion
   entirely from the idea that these objects contain the spirits of the
   dead. If this is not persistent thinking along defined grooves,' I know
   not what it is."--Nineteenth Century, xvi. pp. 362, 363.

   Max Muller subjects the theory to an historical examination in his
   Lectures on Anthropological Religion, and rejects it as based on
   totally mistaken data. "Granting even," he says, "that there are races
   whose religion consists of ancestor worship only, though, as at present
   informed, I know of none, would that prove that the worship of
   nature-gods must everywhere he traced hack to ancestor worship? . . .
   If a pleader may tell a judge that he has been misinformed as to facts,
   surely we may claim the same privilege, without being guilty of any
   want of respect towards a man who, in his own sphere, has done such
   excellent work. I make no secret that I consider the results of Mr. H.
   Spencer's one-sided explanation of the origin of religion as worthy of
   the strongest condemnation which a love of truth can dictate."--Lecture
   V. pp. 13-2, 133.

   See also the examination of this theory in Pfleiderer's
   Religionsphilosophie, iii. pp. 12-16.

   M. Renouf has said: "If from pre-historic we pass to historic times, we
   at once meet on Egyptian ground with an entire system of notions
   wonderfully (indeed almost incredibly) similar to those entertained by
   our Indo-European ancestors. There is, however, no confirmation of Mr.
   Herbert Spencer's theory, that the rudimentary form of all religion is
   the propitiation of dead ancestors. If the Egyptians passed through
   such a rudimentary form of religion, they had already got beyond it in
   the age of the Pyramids, for their most ancient propitiation of
   ancestors is made through prayer to Anubis, Osiris, or some other
   gods."--Hibbert Lectures, p. 127.

   Totemism, or belief in descent from animals worshipped as Divine, is
   another phase of explanation of the origin of religion which also meets
   with little favour from the authorities. "Totemism is one of those
   pseudo-scientific terms," says Max Muller, "which have done infinite
   harm to the study of mythology."--Anthropological Religion, p. 408. See
   his remarks on it in this work, pp. 121-124; and in Natural Religion,
   p. 159. A careful examination of Professor W. R. Smith's theory of
   Totemism, as applied to the Semitic religions, may be seen in an
   article already referred to in the Edinburgh Review for April 1892
   (art. "Semitic Religions "). M. Renouf remarks on another advocate of
   the Totem theory: "Many of you have probably read Mr. M'Lellan's
   articles on the Worship of Animals and Plants.' In order to show that
   the ancient nations passed through what he calls the Totem stage, which
   he says must have been in pre-historic times, be appeals to the signs
   of the Zodiac. . . . Mr. M'Lellan is here more than half a century
   behind his age," etc. And a note adds: "All Mr. M'Lellan's statements
   about the ancient nations are based on equally worthless
   authorities."--Hibbert Lectures, pp. 29, 30.

   Max Muller, Pfleiderer, Reville, and others reject all these theories,
   and find the commencement of religion in the worship of the greater
   objects of nature--such as mountains, rivers, the sun, the sky, etc.
   But if the other theories begin too low, does not this begin too high,
   on the supposition that man started as a savage, and that there was no
   primitive Revelation? May not the advocate of Fetishism reply that man
   must be already far on in his career of development before this grander
   style of worship, which demands a highly evolved imagination, is
   possible to him? And is this view historically supported, any more than
   the others? Do not the facts point to a higher origin for man, and to a
   purer primitive perception of the Divine than these theories allow? See
   next Note, and Note F. to Lecture V.

LECTURE 3 NOTE B.--P. 88.

  OLD TESTAMENT MONOTHEISM.

   Two mutually destructive theories are held by naturalistic critics as
   to the origin of Hebrew Monotheism.

   The first is that of Renan, who traces it to a "Monotheistic instinct"
   said to be inherent in the Semitic race. "The Semitic consciousness,"
   he says, "is clear, but lacks breadth; it has a marvellous
   comprehension of unity, but cannot grasp multiplicity. Monotheism sums
   it up, and explains all its characters."--Hist. generale des Langues
   semitiques, p.5. See this theory explained in the work cited, and in
   the more recent Histoire du Peuple d'Israel, I. chap. iv. It is a
   theory which scarcely requires discussion, so palpably contrary is it
   to all the facts. Cf. in regard to it, Max Muller's essay on "Semitic
   Monotheism," in vol. i. of his Chips from a German Workshop; Baethgen's
   BeitrÃ¤ge zur semitischen Religionsgeschichte; Godet's Biblical Studies
   on the Old Testament, p. 68 (Eng. trans.); and an able article in the
   Edinburgh Review (April 1888).

   The second theory is that of Kuenen and the newer school of critics
   (though it had many older representatives), viz., that the Israelites
   began as polytheists and idolaters like their neighbours, and only
   gradually attained to an "Ethical Monotheism" such as we find in the
   prophets. This theory, therefore, is the precise reverse of the former.
   See it explained in Kuenen's Hibbert Lectures; in Wellhausen's Prol. to
   the Hist. of Israel (Eng. trans.); and in Professor Robertson Smith's
   Old Testament in the Jewish Church, and Religion of the Semites The
   arguments by which it is supported are plausible, yet, when carefully
   looked into, are found to be much more specious than solid. The most
   sifting examination is that of Baethgen, in the work above cited,
   BeitrÃ¤ge zur sem. Religionsgeschichte. See also Konig's Hauptprobleme
   d. altisrael. Rel.; Robertson's Early Religion of Israel (Baird
   Lectures); and Schultz's Alttest. Theol. pp. 159-167 (1889). A good
   discussion of Hebrew Monotheism is found also in Vigouroux's La Bible
   et les Decouvertes modernes, pp. 1-86, "La Religion primitive d'Israel"
   (1881). Baethgen sums up the results of an exhaustive inquiry, first,
   into the general character of Semitic Polytheism; and, second, into the
   question, "Whether, as Kuenen and others maintain, Israel's faith in
   God was really, in the older and middle periods of its history,
   distinct in nothing from that of related tribes?" in the following
   words:--"The historical investigations of both parts lead to the result
   that Israel's faith in God was from the oldest times specifically
   distinct from that of the related tribes; and the contention that the
   Old Testament Monotheism has originated out of Polytheism, in the way
   of natural development, is proved on closer examination to he
   untenable."--Preface.

   A strong argument against the development theory in question may be
   drawn from the results of the newer Pentateuch criticism itself. It is
   surely a remarkable circumstance that, not only in the time of the
   prophets, but in the documents J and E, originating in the early days
   of the kings (perhaps earlier), and embodying independently the oldest
   traditions of the nation, the history already rests on a completely
   Monotheistic basis, and expresses (e.g. in the call of Abraham) the
   clear consciousness of the nation's universal mission and destiny. In
   the -documents referred to, e.g., we have as fundamental, underlying
   ideas, the creation of the world by Jehovah, the unity of the human
   family, the destruction of the whole race by a flood, a covenant with
   Noah embracing the earth, a new descent and distribution of mankind
   from one centre, the recognition of Jehovah as the God of all the
   earth, etc. Schultz, in his Alttestament. Theologie, also lays weight
   on these considerations, though with some preliminary qualifications
   and explanations that the Monotheism involved is a "religious" and not
   a "metaphysical" Monotheism. "In the old songs," he says, "alongside of
   the expression, who is like Jehovah?' there stands clearly the other,
   no God besides Jehovah no rock besides our rock (Ps. xviii. 32; 1 Sam.
   ii. 2). According to the Book of the Covenant, Jehovah has chosen
   Israel precisely because all the world is His (Ex. xix. 5), therefore
   not at all because He, as a particular God, was bound to this hand and
   people. Psalms such as the 8th, 19th, and 29th praise Him who has made
   heaven and earth, in whose holy palace the sons of God stand serving.
   In B and C [the J and E of the ordinary nomenclature], the same Jehovah
   who is the covenant God of Israel is likewise the Creator of the world,
   the God of the patriarchs, whom also, as a matter of course, the
   non-Israelites own as God, the God of the spirits of all flesh (Gen.
   ii. 4 if., iv. 3, 26, xii. 17, xxiv. 31, 50, xxvi. 29; Numb. xvi. 22,
   xxvii. 16). He proves Himself in His miracles and in His majesty the
   Judge and the Destroyer, the world-ruler in Egypt, Sodom, and Canaan In
   fact, therefore, the other Elohim step back as no-gods, who are not
   able to determine the course of time world. He alone is a God who can
   call forth faith, love, and trust. He will reveal His glory also to the
   heathen world, and He will not rest till it fills the whole earth (Ex.
   xv. 2). . . . But a people which itself worships only one God, and
   regards this God as the world-creator and the controller of all world
   destiny, is for that reason monotheistic. . . . A God whose rule is not
   bound to the land and people in which He is worshipped is no more a
   mere national God. Thus the particularism of the God-idea in Israel has
   already become only the sheltering husk under which the pure Monotheism
   of the Old Testament could unfold itself and mature."--Pp. 166, 167.

  KANT ON THE COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT.

   Kant characterises this argument as a perfect "nest" of dialectical
   assumptions.--Kritik, p. 427 (Eng. trans. p. 374). Yet it might be
   shown that the objections he takes to it depend almost exclusively on
   his theory of knowledge--e.g., that the mind is confined to phenomena;
   that the law of cause and effect has no application--except in the
   world of phenomena (though Kant himself applies it in positing an
   action of things per se on the sensitive subject, and introduces a
   "causality " of the noumenal self, etc.). [891] The same remark applies
   to the "antinomies" or self-contradictions in which the mind is said to
   involve itself in every attempt at a theoretic application of the
   cosmological "Idea." The "antinomies" are rather to be regarded as
   rival alternatives of thought, which, indeed, are contradictory of each
   other, but which do not stand on the same footing as regards
   admissibility. Rather they are of such a nature that the mind is found
   to reject one, while it feels itself shut up to accept the other. E.g.,
   The world has either a beginning in time or it has not. The alternative
   here is an eternal retrogression of phenomenal causes and effects, or
   the admission of an extra-phenomenal First Cause--God. But these do not
   stand on the same footing. The mind rejects the former as unthinkable
   and self-contradictory (see Lecture IV.); the latter it not only does
   not reject, but feels a rational satisfaction in admitting. Again,
   there is the antinomy between natural causation and freedom of will.
   But this is only an antinomy if we hold that the law of causation
   applicable to physical phenomena is the only kind of causation we
   know--that there may not be rational, intelligent causation over and
   above the physical and determinate. Something here also depends on the
   definition of freedom.
     __________________________________________________________________

  KANT ON THE TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT.

   Kant says: "This proof deserves always to be mentioned with respect. It
   is the oldest, clearest, and the most suited to the common reason of
   mankind. It enlivens the study of nature, even as it derives from this
   its own existence, and draws from it ever new strength. It brings ends
   and purposes into a region where our observation would not of itself
   have discovered them, and furthers our natural knowledge through the
   guiding thought of a special unity, whose principle lies outside of
   nature. This knowledge reacts upon its cause, namely, on the idea which
   occasions it, and raises faith in a highest Author of the universe to
   an irresistible conviction. It would, therefore, be not only a
   thankless, but also a vain task, to attempt to detract in any measure
   from the prestige of this argument." But he goes on to say: "Although
   we have nothing to object to the rationality and utility of this
   procedure, but have much rather to recommend and encourage it, we are
   nevertheless unable to assent to the claims which this mode of proof
   may make to demonstrative certainty," and then proceeds to state his
   objections to it.--Kritik, p. 436, 437 (Eng. trans. p. 383). [892]
   These, however, as observed in the text, seem more in the direction of
   limiting its application, than of altogether denying its cogency. The
   view which obtains in the Kritik of Judgment, that the idea of design
   has only regulative and not theoretic validity, [893] is not dwelt on
   in the Kritik or Pure Reason. It is not always noticed, besides, that,
   intermediate between full theoretic demonstration and mere opinion,
   Kant has a form of conviction which he calls "doctrinal
   faith"--distinct from moral faith,--the characteristic of which is that
   it is an expression of modesty front the objective point of view, but
   of assured confidence from the subjective; and that he places the
   doctrine of God's existence in this region.--Kritik, p. 561 (Eng.
   trans. p. 500). On Kant's service to this argument by his
   demonstration, in the Kritik of Judgment, of the necessity of applying
   the teleological conception to nature, see Dr. Bernard's valuable
   Introduction to his recent translation of this work (1892), and cf.
   Professor Caird's Philosophy of Kant, ii. pp. 406-562.

NOTE E.--P. 99.

  SCHOOLS OF EVOLUTIONISTS.

   It is well to recognise the fact that evolutionists do not constitute a
   homogeneous party; amid that, while there is a growing disposition to
   acknowledge the reality of Organic Evolution, there is likewise a
   growing tendency to question the sufficiency of the causes by which Mr.
   Darwin sought to account for it.

   1. From the first there has been an important section of evolutionists,
   represented by such names as Owen, Mivart, Asa Gray, G. H. Lewes, Dana,
   and J. J. Murphy (in his Habit and Intelligence), who, with differences
   among themselves, held that the rise of species could not be accounted
   for by the Darwinian hypothesis of Natural Selection acting on
   fortuitous variations. The tendency in this school was to seek the
   causes of evolution within, rather than without, the organism. Most of
   them were theistic evolutionists--i.e. they held that the development
   of organisms could not be explained without the assumptions of
   intelligence and purpose. Not all who opposed the Darwinian hypothesis
   were of this class. Mr. G. H. Lewes, e.g., writes: "At each stage of
   differentiation there has been a selection, but we cannot by any means
   say that this selection was determined by the fact of its giving the
   organism a superiority over rivals inasmuch as during all the early
   stages, while the organ was still In formation, there could be no
   advantage occurring from it. . . . The sudden appearance of new organs,
   not a trace of which is discernible in the embryo or adult form of
   organisms lower in the scale--for instance, the phosphorescent and
   electric organs--is like the sudden appearance of new instruments in
   the social organism, such as the printing press and the railway, wholly
   inexplicable on the theory of descent, but is explicable on the theory
   of organic affinity" (!).--Physical Basis of Mind, pp. 110, 117.

   2. Important differences exist between Mr. Darwin and his fellow-worker
   in the same field, Mr. A. Wallace, involving a distinction of principle
   on two vital points. (l) Mr. Darwin's own views underwent considerable
   modifications in the direction of recognising that Natural Selection is
   not an all-sufficient explanation, and that more must be allowed to
   forces interior to the organism. See his Descent of Man, p.61; and Cf.
   Mivart's Lessons from Nature, viii., ix., and the articles of Spencer
   and Romanes cited below. He specially supplemented it by the hypothesis
   of Sexual Selection. These alterations on the theory Mr. Wallace
   rejects, repudiating Sexual Selection, and maintaining the hypothesis
   in the form in which Mr. Darwin abandoned it. (2) Mr. Darwin held his
   theory to be all inclusive, embracing man as well as the lower animals;
   Mr. Wallace holds that there are provable breaks in the chain of
   evolution, and that man, in particular, has a distinct origin. See
   Lecture IV.

   3. Yet more significant is the recent tendency to revolt against. the
   authority of Mr. Darwin, and to recognise the existence of large
   classes of phenomena which Natural Selection does not explain. This
   change of front in recent discussions on Darwinism is too marked to
   escape notice. I take one or two examples which may show the drift of
   opinion.

   Mr. G. J. Romanes, who as late as 1882 wrote a book on The Scientific
   Evidences of Evolution, in which Mr. Darwin's theory received
   uncompromising support, afterwards wrote in 1887: "The hypothesis of
   Physiological Selection (his own view) sets out with an attempted proof
   of the inadequacy of the theory of Natural Selection, considered as a
   theory of the origin of species. This proof is drawn from three
   distinct heads of evidence--(l) the inutility to species of a large
   number of their specific characters; (2) the general fact of sterility
   between allied species, which admittedly cannot be explained by Natural
   Selection, and therefore has hitherto never been explained; (3) the
   swamping influence, upon even useful variations, of free intercrossing
   with the parent form."--"Physiological Selection," in Nineteenth
   Century, January 1887. The effect of Mr. Romanes's heresy was to arouse
   "a storm of criticism" from the orthodox Darwinian party.

   Mr. Herbert Spencer has published two papers on "Factors of Organic
   Evolution," in which, while still according an important place to
   Natural Selection, he very greatly restricts its field of action. The
   articles, he says, "will perhaps help to show that it is as yet far too
   soon to close the inquiry concerning the causes of Organic
   Evolution."--P. 75. In a subsequent article in the Nineteenth Century;
   he thus delivers his soul: "The new biological orthodoxy behaves just
   as the old biological orthodoxy did. In the days before Darwin, those
   who occupied themselves with the phenomena of life passed by with
   unobservant eye the multitudinous facts which point to an evolutionary
   origin for plants and animals; and they turned deaf ears to those who
   insisted upon the significance of these facts. Now that they have come
   to believe in this evolutionary origin, and have at the same time
   accepted the hypothesis that Natural Selection has been the sole cause
   of the evolution, they are similarly unobservant of the multitudinous
   facts which cannot rationally be ascribed to that cause, and turn deaf
   ears to those who would draw their attention to them. The attitude is
   the same; it is only the creed that has changed."--Nineteenth Century,
   February 1888.

   In a well-written and appreciative Essay on Charles Darwin in "The
   Round Table Series," the same criticism is passed upon the theory that
   from the standpoint of biology too much stress has been laid on Natural
   Selection. "Natural Selection obviously can never be the cause of
   modifications in any given individual. . . . Natural Selection cannot
   cause an iota of modification in structure. . . . In the case of Human
   Selection, not the least modification in an organism can he produced by
   the process of selection itself. The modifications somehow produced in
   the animals selected are transmitted to the offspring; but the cause of
   modification lies elsewhere than in selection; and it is largely due to
   man's own modification of the environment. . . . It would undoubtedly
   have been better had Darwin omitted Natural Selection as a modifying
   agent altogether."--Pp. 22-26.

   Even Professor Huxley sounds a wavering note: "How far Natural
   Selection suffices for the production of species remains to he seen.
   . . . On the evidence of palaentology, the evolution of many existing
   forms of animal life from their predecessors is no longer an
   hypothesis, but an historical fact; it is only the nature of the
   physiological factors to which that evolution is due which is still
   open to discussion."--Art. "Evolution" in Ency. Brit.

   4. Yet more deep-reaching is the controversy between the older
   Darwinian and Spencerian schools on the One hand, and the newer school
   headed by Prof. Weismann on the other, on the subject of the
   transmissibility of acquired characters. According to Mr. Spencer,
   "either there has been inheritance of acquired characters, or there has
   been no evolution."--Cont. Rev., March 1893, p. 446. But this Weismann,
   Lankester, and others absolutely deny. See controversy between Mr.
   Spencer and Prof. Weismann in Cont. Rev, for 1893; and cf. Weismann's
   Papers on Heredity (trans. 1889), Einer's Organic Evolution, Thomson's
   Study of Animal Life, chap. xx., etc.

   Good general criticisms of the Darwinian theory may be seen in Mivart's
   Genesis of Species, Murphy's Habit and Intelligence, Elam's Winds of
   Doctrine, Bouverie Pusey's Permanence and Evolution (1882), Van Dyke's
   Theism and Evolution, Professor Sehurman's Ethical Import of Darwinism,
   Principal Dawson's Modern Ideas of Evolution, Martineau's Study of
   Religion, Iverach's Christianity and Evolution, etc.

  KANT ON THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT.

   Kant holds firmly to the invalidity of all inference from the idea of
   God to His reality; but here also it is to be noticed that he allows to
   his "Ideal of Pure Reason" an important part in Natural Theology. If
   theoretic reason cannot prove, neither can it disprove the objective
   reality of this ideal of a supreme Being; and given a proof, or a
   conviction, from any other quarter (from the Practical . Reason or a
   "doctrinal faith" from design), it is of the highest utility in
   correcting and purifying our conception of this Being. "For," he says,
   "though Reason in its merely speculative use is far from competent to
   so great an undertaking as to reach the existence of a supreme Being;
   yet it is of very great service in correcting the knowledge of such a
   Being, provided this can be drawn from some other source; in making it
   consistent with itself, and with each intelligible view of things; and
   in purifying it from everything which would contradict the notion of a
   primary Being, and from all mixture of empirical limitations. . . . The
   supreme Being, therefore remains for the merely speculative use of
   Reason a mere Ideal, though one free from error, a notion which
   completes and crowns the whole of human knowledge, whose objective
   reality cannot indeed by this method be proved, but also cannot be
   disproved; and if there should be a Moral Theology which can supply
   this defect, the hitherto only problematic transcendental theology will
   show its indispensableness in the determination of its notion and the
   unceasing criticism of a reason often enough deceived by sense, and not
   always in agreement with its own ideas. The necessity, infinity, unity,
   existence apart from the world (not as world-soul), eternity without
   conditions of time, omnipresence without conditions of space,
   omnipotence, etc., are pure transcendental predicates, and therefore
   the purified conception of the same, which every theology finds so
   necessary, can be drawn from transcendental theology alone."--Kritik,
   pp. 446, 447 (Eng. trans. pp. 392, 393).
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE III NOTE G.--P. 105.

  RATIONAL REALISM.

   This argument is well stated by Pfleiderer in the following words: "The
   agreement, therefore," he says, " of the ideal laws of thought, which
   are not drawn from the outer world, and the real laws of being, which
   are not created by our thought, is a fact of experience of the most
   incontrovertible kind; the whole certainty of our knowledge rests on
   it. But how are we to account for this agreement? There is only one
   possible way in which the agreement of our thought with the being of
   the world can be made intelligible: the presupposition of a common
   ground of both, in which thought and being must be one; or the
   assumption that the real world-ground is at the same time the ideal
   ground of our spirit, hence the absolute Spirit, creative Reason, which
   appears in the world-law on its real, in the law of thought on its
   ideal side. The connection of thought and being, subject and object, in
   the finite and derivative spiritual being, points back to the unity of
   the two in the infinite Spirit as the ground and original type of ours.
   This is the meaning of the ontological ' argument, as indicated even in
   the word. We may find it anticipated even in Plato, in the thought that
   the highest idea, or the Deity, is the cause both of being and of
   knowledge; and Augustine follows him in this, frequently and in a
   number of turns of thought, tracing back our faculty of knowing the
   truth to the fact of our participation in God, who is the substantial
   truth, the unchangeable law both of the world and of our thought. In
   modern times this thought forms the foundation and corner-stone of
   speculative philosophy."--Religionsphilosophie, iii. p. 274 (Eng.
   trans.).

   The germs of this theory are found in Leibnitz, Herder, Goethe, and
   most of the deeper thinkers. It is the thought which underlies Mr.
   Green's Prolegomena to Ethics. Professor Samuel Harris, of Yale
   College, makes it the ground of his Philosophical Basis of Theism; and
   it largely influences current thought.

  THE CREATION HISTORY.

   The rights and wrongs of the reconcilability of the creation narrative
   in Gen. i. with modern science have recently been discussed anew by Mr.
   Gladstone and Professor Huxley in the Nineteenth Century (vols. xviii
   and xix.). I do not enter into this discussion. But if the one
   disputant imports into this early narrative more than it will bear, the
   other surely does less than justice to it when he brackets it "with the
   cosmogonies of other nations, and especially with those of the
   Egyptians and the Babylonians," as essentially of the same character
   with these.

   I content myself with quoting on this point the tribute to this ancient
   narrative by Haeckel, surely an unprejudiced witness, in his History of
   Creation. He says: "The Mosaic history of creation, since, in the first
   chapter of Genesis, it forms the introduction to the Old Testament, has
   enjoyed, down to the present day, general recognition in the whole
   Jewish and Christian world of civilisation. Its extraordinary success
   is explained, not only by its close connection with Jewish and
   Christian doctrines, but also by the simple and natural chain of ideas
   which runs through it, and which contrasts favourably with the confused
   mythology of creation current among most of the ancient nations. First,
   God creates the earth as an inorganic body; then He separates light
   from darkness, then water from the dry land. New the earth has become
   habitable for organisms, and plants are first created, animals later;
   and among the latter the inhabitants of the water and of the air first,
   afterwards the inhabitants of the dry land. Finally, God creates man,
   the last of all organisms, in His own image, and as the ruler of the
   earth. Two great and fundamental ideas, common also to the
   nonmiraculous theory of development, meet us in the Mosaic hypothesis
   of creation with surprising clearness and simplicity--the idea of
   separation or differentiation, and the idea of progressive development
   or perfecting. Although Moses looks upon the results of the great laws
   of organic development (which we shall later point out as the necessary
   conclusions of the Doctrine of Descent) as the direct actions of a
   constructing Creator, yet in his theory there lies hidden the ruling
   idea of a progressive development and a differentiation of the
   originally simple matter. We can therefore bestow our just and sincere
   admiration on the Jewish lawgiver's grand insight into nature, and his
   simple and natural hypothesis of creation, without discovering in it a
   so-called Divine Revelation."--Hist. of Creation, i. pp. 37, 38 (Eng.
   trans.).

   The grounds on which Haeckel concludes that it cannot be a Divine
   Revelation are--(1) the geocentric error that the earth is the central
   point in the universe; and (2) the anthropomorphic error that man is
   the premeditated end of the creation of the earth,--neither of which
   "errors" need greatly distress us. For the rest, the creation narrative
   certainly goes back on early tradition, [894] and is not a scientific
   precis, written in the light of the latest discoveries of modern
   geology. Yet it is possible to hold that the Spirit of Revelation is
   active in it, not merely making it the vehicle of general religious
   ideas, but enabling the writer really to seize the great stadia of the
   creation process, and to represent these in such a way as to convey a
   practically accurate conception of them to men's minds. Modern science
   may supplement, it is astonishing how little it requires us to reverse
   of, the ideas we derive from this narrative of the succession of steps
   in creation, assuming that we deal with it fairly, in its broad and
   obvious intention, and not in a carping and pettifogging spirit. The
   dark watery waste over which the Spirit broods with vivifying power,
   the advent of light, the formation of an atmosphere or sky capable of
   sustaining the clouds above it, the settling of the great outlines of
   the continents and seas, the clothing of the dry land with abundant
   vegetation, the adjustment of the earth's relation to sun and moon as
   the visible rulers of its day and night, the production of the great
   sea monsters and reptile-like creatures (for these may well be included
   in "sheratzim") and birds, the peopling of the earth with four-footed
   beasts and cattle--last of all, the advent of Man--is there so much of
   all this which science requires us to cancel? Even in regard to the
   duration of time involved,--those dies ineffabiles of which Augustine
   speaks, [895] --it is at least as difficult to suppose that only
   ordinary days of twenty-four hours are intended, in view of the
   writer's express statement that such days did not commence till the
   fourth stage in creation, as to believe that they are
   symbols.--Delitzsch defends the symbolic interpretation in his New
   Commentary on Genesis, p. 84 (Eng. trans.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [894] Modern criticism would bring down the age of this narrative to
   the Exile, and explain its origin by late Babylonian influence; but the
   Dillmann and Delitzsch have shown strong reasons for rejecting this
   view, and for regarding the tradition as one of the oldest possessions
   of the Israelites.--Cf. Delitzsch's New Com. on Gen. pp. 63-66; and
   Whitehouse in Introduction to Eng. trans. of Schrader's
   Keilinschriften, i. pp. 18, 19, on Dillmann.

   [895] "Of what fashion those days were," says Augustine, "it is either
   exceeding hard or altogether impossible to think, much more to speak.
   As for ordinary days, we see they have neither morning nor evening, but
   as the sun rises and sets. But the first three days of all had no sun,
   for that was made on the fourth day," etc.--De Civitate Dei, xi. 6, 7.

  EVOLUTION IN INORGANIC NATURE--THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.

   This famous hypothesis of Kant and Laplace is frequently spoken of as
   if it had become an established fact of science; and it forms an
   integral part in most sketches of the process of cosmic evolution (as
   in Strauss, Spencer, Clodd, etc.). Yet so far is it from being
   established, that the objections to its sufficiency seem to multiply
   and strengthen as years go on, and many eminent men of science reject
   it altogether.

   Mr. B. A. Proctor, in an article on the "Meteor Birth of the Universe,"
   contributed to the Manchester Examiner and Times, May 29, 1888, thus
   speaks of it:--

   "The nebular theory of Laplace has long held a somewhat anomalous
   position. Advanced by its distinguished author as a mere hypothesis, in
   days when the word hypothesis' had still its proper significance (as
   shown in Newton's saying, Hypotheses non fingo'), it had from the
   beginning a fascination for most minds, which led to its acceptance as
   if it had been a veritable theory. Yet it has never been accepted as a
   theory by one single student of science who has possessed adequate
   knowledge of physics, combined with adequate knowledge of astronomy and
   mathematics."

   After sketching the theory, he proceeds: "The nebulous speculation of
   Laplace is open to two most serious objections. In the first place, as
   I have already pointed out, a vaporous mass of enormous size, and of
   the exceeding tenuity imagined, could not possibly rotate in a single
   mass in the manner suggested by Laplace. In the second place, some of
   the most characteristic peculiarities of the solar system remain
   altogether unaccounted for by this speculation, ingeniously though it
   accounts for others."

   These objections are then developed. Mr. Proctor's rival theory is that
   of "Meteoric Aggregation." See, further, his More Worlds than Ours,
   chapter on "Comets and Meteors."

   A searching examination of this theory, embodying the views of M.
   Babinet, may be seen in Stallo's Concepts of Modern Physics
   (International Library), pp. 277-286.

   Sir Robert S. Ball, Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, says of it:
   "Nor can it be ever more than a speculation; it cannot be established
   by observation, nor can it be proved by calculation. It is merely a
   conjecture, more or less plausible, but perhaps m some degree
   necessarily true, if our present laws of heat, as we understand them,
   admit of the extreme application here required, and if also the present
   system of things has reigned for sufficient time without the
   intervention of any influence at present unknown to us."--The Story of
   the Heavens, p. 506
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE IV NOTE C.--P. 127.

  THE HYPOTHESIS OF CYCLES.

   The idea of an eternal succession of cycles of existence--of
   alternating periods of dissolution and renovation--of the destruction
   of worlds, and continual birth of new worlds from the ruins of the
   old--could not but present itself early o the minds of speculative
   thinkers whose theories did not admit of a beginning of the world in
   time. We find it in Brahmanism, in some of the early Greek
   philosophies, among the Stoics, and it has been frequently revived in
   modern times as an alternative to the doctrine of creation.

   Zeller says of the Greek Anaximandel: "The assertion which ascribes to
   Anaximander an infinity of successive worlds seems borne out by his
   system. . . . Plutarch, indeed, expressly says of Anaximander that from
   the Infinite, as the sole cause of the birth and destruction of all
   things, he considered that the heavens and the innumerable worlds arise
   in endless circulation; and Hippolytus speaks to the same effect. . .
   .Cicero, too, makes mention of innumerable worlds, which in long
   periods of time arise and perish; and Stobaeus attributes to
   Anaximander the theory of the future destruction of the world. . . .
   The same theory of a constant alternation of birth and destruction in
   the universe was held by Heraclitus, who approaches more closely to
   Anaximander than to any of the ancient Ionian physicists, and also most
   probably by Anaximenes and Diogenes. We have reason, therefore, to
   suppose that Anaximander also held it."--Pre-Socratic Philosophy, pp.
   259, 260.

   This theory was revived by Kant in his Theory of the Heavens in 1755,
   [896] and was adopted from him by Strauss (in his Glaubenslehre and Der
   alte und der neue Glaube, pp. 153-160). Vatke and others also held it.

   Mr. Spencer, with all his profession of nescience about origins, adopts
   this theory, as in reason he is compelled to do if he advocates
   evolution, and yet refuses to admit a beginning in time.--First
   Principles, pp. 519-537, 550, 551.

   There is a fascination and grandeur in this conception of endless
   cycles of existence,--of new worlds perpetually rising from the ashes
   of the old,--but it is a theory which cannot be maintained.

   1. Philosophically, it involves all the difficulties which, in
   discussing the cosmological argument, we saw to inhere in the notion of
   an endless succession of causes and effects. This, as respects the past
   (regressus in infinitum), is a supposition which is not simply
   inconceivable, but which reason compels us positively to reject as
   Self-contradictory.

   2. Scientifically, it seems disproved by the doctrine of the
   dissipation of energy, and of the tendency of the material universe to
   a state of final equilibrium. This doctrine is stated by Sir William
   Thomson (now Lord Kelvin) in the following terms:--

   "(1) There is at present in the material world a universal tendency to
   the dissipation of mechanical energy. [897]

   "(2) Any restoration of mechanical energy, without more than an
   equivalent of dissipation, is impossible in inanimate material
   processes, and is probably never effected by material masses, either
   endowed with vegetable life, or subjected to the will of an animated
   creature.

   "(3) Within a finite past, the earth must have been, and within a
   finite period of time to come the earth must again be, unfit for the
   habitation of man as at present constituted, unless operations have
   been, or are to be, performed which are impossible under the laws to
   which the known operations going on at present in the material world
   are subject."--Paper "On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the
   Dissipation of Mechanical Energy," in Phil. Meg., ser. iv. vol x. p.
   304ff. Cf. Tait's Recent Advances in Physical Science, p. 146; Stewart
   and Tait's The Unseen Universe, pp. 93, 94, 126-128, 211-214 (5th ed.);
   and Jevons's Principles of Science, ii. p. 483. Mr. Spencer himself
   admits that, as the outcome of the processes everywhere going on, we
   are " manifestly progressing towards omnipresent death,"--that "the
   proximate end of all the transformations we have traced is a state of
   quiescence."--First Principles, p. 514.

   Stewart and Tait say: "The tendency of heat is towards equalisation;
   heat is par excellence the communist of our universe, and it will no
   doubt ultimately bring the present system to an end."--Unseen Universe,
   p. 126.

   Professor Huxley says of astronomy, that it " leads us to contemplate
   phenomena, the very nature of which demonstrates that they must have
   had a beginning, and that they must have an end, but the very nature of
   which also proves that the beginning was, to our conceptions of time,
   infinitely remote, and that the end is as immeasurably distant."--Lay
   Sermons, Addresses, etc., p. 17 ("On the Advisableness of Improving
   Natural Knowledge"

   Cf. on the cycle of hypothesis, Flint's Philosophy of History, pp.
   30-35; Dorner in criticism of Vatke, Person of Christ, pp. 122, 123;
   and Chapman in criticism of Spencer, Pre-Organic Evolution, pp.
   179-190.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [896] Kant, however, held a beginning. See Strauss's criticism of him
   in passage cited.

   [897] Professor Proctor says that only the two hundred and
   twenty-seventh part of the one millionth of all the heat from the sun
   reaches any planet; the remainder passes into spance and is lost.

LECTURE IV NOTE D.--P. 130.

  "ETERNAL CREATION."

   Origen's views are stated in his De Principiis, Book i. 2, iii. 5, etc.
   In the former passage he argues that God would not be omnipotent if He
   had not eternally creatures on which to exercise His power. In the
   latter he deals with the objection: "If the world had its beginning in
   time, what was God doing before the world began? For it is at once
   impious and absurd to say that the nature of God is inactive and
   immovable, or to suppose that goodness at one time did not do good, and
   omnipotence at one time did not exercise its power"; and gives for
   answer: "Not then for the first time did God begin to work when He made
   this visible world; but as, after its destruction, there will he
   another world, so also we believe that others existed before the
   present came into being. . . . By these testimonies it is established
   both that there were ages before our own, and that there will be others
   after it."--Ante-Nicene Library, trans. pp. 28, 255. Origen's view of
   eternal creation is thus that of an eternal succession of worlds.

   That profound medieval speculative thinker, John Scotus Erigena, held
   the doctrine of an eternal creation. See the sketch of his system in
   Ueberweg's Hist. of Phil. i. 358-365.

   Rothe's views are contained in his Theolegische Ethik, i. sees. 40-52
   (a special discussion of the point in sec. 52, pp. 193-204, 2nd ed.),
   and his Dogmatik, pp. 138-160. His theory turns on the notion that in
   positing his I, God must also, by a necessity of thought, posit his
   not-I, which is identified by him with pure matter, and is the product
   of an eternal act. This is the act of creation proper, and is
   beginningless; and from it is to he distinguished the world, which is
   the product of finite development, and has its existence in space and
   time--has therefore a beginning in time. "What has been created in
   time," he says, "that has naturally a beginning; but as undoubtedly has
   that which was created when there was not time no beginning. For a
   beginning can only be spoken of where there is time. The world is
   consequently in no way without beginning (as little in a spatial as in
   a temporal reference), and nothing belonging to the world is."--Theol.
   Ethik, pp. 198, 199.

   Rothe's pure matter is almost identified by him with space and time.

   The idea of a beginning of God's creative activity, Schlelermacher
   thinks, places Him, as a temporal being in the domain of change.--Der
   christ. Glaube, 3. pp. 200, 201.

   The views of Lipsius may be seen in his Dogmatik, pp. 292, 293. "It is
   only a sensuous representation," he says," to lead back creation upon a
   single act now lying in the past, or to speak of a first beginning' of
   creation; rather is the total world-development, so soon as it is
   viewed religiously, to be placed under the notion of creation,
   consequently to be regarded as without beginning or end."--P. 293.
   Darner solves the problem by the supposition of a temporal world
   standing midway between two eternal ones. "Just, therefore," he says,
   "as we have no right to say that this law of succession, and this
   progress from imperfect to perfect, must continue for ever,-- so also
   we have no right to say that this world, tangible to sense and subject
   to temporality, cannot have been preceded by a world of pure spirits
   (although spirits not yet subject to laws of historical progress),
   which are withdrawn in the first instance from all relation of
   succession, and exist in the simultaneity of all their constituent
   elements, and in this character surround the throne of God,--a kingdom
   of which it cannot be said that a time was when it was not, not merely
   because no time was ere it was, but also because for it there was no
   time, no succession or becoming. This world can only be brought under
   the standpoint of time by reference to the succeeding world. From this
   point of view it appears a preceding one, already belonging to the
   past. Thus, midway between the eternal world of the end, in which
   temporal existence merges, and the world of the beginning standing in
   the light of eternity, may lie, like an island in a broad ocean, the
   present world bound to temporal existence."--System of Doctrine, ii. p.
   33 (Eng. trans.).

   Lotze teaches "that the will to create' is an absolutely eternal
   predicate of God, and ought not to be used to designate a deed of His,
   so much as the absolute dependence of the world upon His will, in
   contradistinction to its involuntary emanation' from His
   nature."--Outlines of the Phil. of Religion, p. 74 (Eng. trans.).

   The authors of The Unseen Universe hold that the resent visible
   universe, which had a beginning and will have an end, is developed out
   of an unseen and eternal one. "We are led," they say, "not only to
   regard the invisible universe as having existed before the present one,
   but the, same principle drives us to acknowledge its existence in some
   form as a universe from all eternity." Unseen Universe, p. 215; cf. pp.
   94, 95.

   The theory of an eternal creation is contested, on the other hand, by
   Van Oosterzee (Dogmatics, pp. 303, 304, Eng. trans.), Gretillat
   (Theologie Systematique, iii. 392-397), Muller (Christ. Doct. of Sin,
   i. pp. 224-227, Eng. trans.), etc.

   The difficulties which attach to such theories as Rothe's and Dorner's,
   which only shift the problem from the absolute beginning to the
   beginning of the temporal developing world, are pointed out by Muller
   in his criticism of the former: " Do not the difficulties supposed to
   be involved in a beginning of the world return now as really insoluble,
   because, while denying its beginning, we have to allow the fact of its
   eternal creation, and to believe that God, having left it as it was for
   a limitless period, barely existing as materia bruta, at length began
   at some definite time to think of it and ordain it, i.e. to begin to
   develop it towards the goal of its becoming spirit. And if the
   beginning of the world involves a transition from non-creation to
   creation inconsistent with God's unchangeableness, have we not here
   also a transition on God's part from inactivity to action equally
   inadmissible, because in this case God's Revelation of Himself in
   outward activity becomes a necessity of His nature?"--Christ. Doct. of
   Sin, p. 226 (Eng. trans.).

  ETERNITY AND TIME.

   This difficult problem has exercised the minds of thinkers in all ages.

   Augustine has profound thoughts on the subject in his De Civitate Dei.
   "For if eternity and time be well considered," he says, " time never to
   be extant without motion, and eternity to admit no change, who would
   not see that time could not have being before some movable thing were
   created? . . . Seeing, therefore, that God, whose eternity alters not,
   created the world and time, how can He be said to have created the
   world in time, unless you will say there was something created before
   the world whose course time did follow? . . . Then, verily, the world
   was made with time and not in time (mundus non in tempore sed cum
   tempore factus est), for that which is made in time is made both before
   some time and after some. Before it is time past; after it is time to
   come; but no time passed before the world, because no creature was made
   by whose course it might pass."--Book xi. 6. [898]

   Rothe goes deeply into the question in his Theologische Ethik, i. pp.
   193-204 (2nd ed.); and Lotze discusses it with suggestiveness and
   subtlety in his Microcosmos, ii. pp. 708-713.

   The following remarks in Dorner are in consonance with a suggestion in
   the text: "When, therefore, the world comes into actual existence,
   actual time comes into existence. The actual world is preceded by
   merely possible time; of course, not in a temporal sense, else must
   time have existed before time, but in a logical sense. From the point
   of view of actual time, merely possible time can only be mentally
   represented under the image of the past; and the same is true of the
   eternal world-idea, and God's eternity in relation to the world's
   actual existence."--System of Doctrine, ii. p. 30 (Eng. trans.).

   Dr. Hutcheson Stirling has also his thoughts on this difficulty. "It is
   easy," he says, "to use the words, the predicates that describe what we
   conceive to be eternal; as, for example, in the terms of Plato to say
   that the eternal, what is always unmoved, the same, can become by time
   neither older nor younger, nor has been made, nor appears now, nor will
   be in the future, nor can any of those things at all attach to it which
   mortal birth has grafted on the things of sense'; but how to bring into
   connection with this everlasting rest the never-resting movement of
   time--that is the difficulty." I confess that his suggestion that "time
   may be no straight line, as we are apt to figure it, but a curve--a
   curve that eventually returns into itself," does not seem to me greatly
   to relieve the difficulty.--Phil. and Theol. p. 105.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [898] Augustine, however, in these remarks does little more than
   reproduce Plato in the Timaeus. See the striking passage, Jowett's
   Plato, iii. p. 620 (2nd ed.).

LECTURE IV NOTE F.--P. 135.

  MAN THE HEAD OF CREATION.

   This thought of man as the crown and masterpiece of creation--the goal
   of its developments--finds the most varied expression in writers of
   different schools. I cite a few illustrative instances.

   Kant finds man to be " not merely like all organised beings, an end of
   nature, but also here on earth the last end of nature, in reference to
   whom all other natural things constitute a system of ends."--Kritik d.
   Urtheilskraft, p. 280 (Erd. ed.).

   It is the key-thought of Herder's Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte,
   that man is the connecting link between two worlds; on the one hand,
   the highest of nature's products, crowning its ascent from plant to
   animal, and front lower to higher grades of animal life, till finally
   it rests in him; and, on the other, the starting-point of a new order
   of spiritual existences. "All is bound together in nature; one
   condition strives towards another, and prepares the way for it. If,
   therefore, man closes the chain of terrestrial organisations as its
   highest and last member, he likewise begins, just on that account, the
   chain of a higher order of creatures, as the lowest member of it; and
   thus is probably the middle-link between two systems of creation,
   intimately connected with each other."--Ideen, Bk. v. 6.

   It is virtually Herder's thought which Dr. H. Stirling reproduces when
   he says: "There is a rise from object to object. The plant is above the
   stone, and the animal above the plant. But man is the most perfect
   result. His supremacy is assured. He alone of all living creatures is
   erect; and he is erect by reason of the Divinity within him whose
   office it is to know, to think, and to consider. All other animals are
   but incomplete, imperfect, dwarf, beside man."--Phil. and Theol. p.
   137.

   That man is the apex of the evolutionary movement is, of course,
   recognised by all, though not necessarily with acknowledgment of final
   cause. Professor Huxley, in his Man's Place in Nature, says: "In view
   of the intimate relations between man and the rest of the living world,
   and between the forces exerted by the latter and all other forces, I
   can see no excuse for doubting that all are co-ordinated forms of
   Nature's great progression from the formless to the formed, from the
   inorganic to the organic, from blind force to conscious intellect and
   will" (p. 108); and Professor Tyndall, in his Belfast Address,
   describing how in the Primates the evolution of intellect and the
   evolution of tactual appendages go hand in hand, says: "Man crowns the
   edifice here." And Mr. Wallace regards man as not only placed "apart,
   as the head and culminating point of the grand series of organic
   nature, but as in some degree a new order of being."--Nat. Selection,
   pp. 351, 352.

   Mr. Fiske may he quoted, who says suggestively: "The doctrine of
   evolution, by exhibiting the development of the highest spiritual human
   qualities as the goal toward which God's creative work has from the
   outset been tending, replaces Man in his old position of headship in
   the universe, even as in the days of Dante and Thomas Aquinas. That
   which the pre-Copernican astronomy naively thought to do by placing the
   home of Man in the centre of the physical universe, the Darwinian
   biology profoundly accomplishes by exhibiting Man as the terminal fact
   in that stupendous process of evolution whereby things have come to be
   what they are. In the deepest sense it is as true as it ever was held
   to be, that the world was made for Man, and that the bringing forth in
   him of those qualities which we call highest and holiest is the final
   cause of creation."--Idea of God, Introd. pp. 20, 21. Cf. also the
   chapters on "Man's Place in Nature as affected by Darwinism," and "On
   the Earth there will never be a Higher Creature than Man" in his Man's
   Destiny (1890).

   I quote further only the following sentences from Kaftan: "The end of
   nature, of its history and its development, can be sought only in
   humanity, in the fact that man is the crown of the creation.' We men
   can find or discover nothing in the whole world environing us which can
   be put in comparison with man and his spiritual life, still less which
   surpasses him. . . . We must on this account form the idea of an end of
   the natural development, and then what scientific knowledge offers in
   particulars advances to meet this thought. For this idea would have no
   support if it were not upheld by the conviction of an end pertaining to
   man and to his history. That the development of the natural world has
   its end in man, becomes a rational thought, first of all, when I can
   speak in turn of an end to which the world of humanity itself has
   regard."--Wahrheit, etc., p. 418.

  MIND AND MECHANICAL CAUSATION.

   It is well to see clearly what this "gradual banishment from all
   regions of human thought of what we call spirit and spontaneity," which
   Professor Huxley speaks of ("On the Physical Basis of Life"), involves;
   and the matter could not he much better put than it is by Mr. Kennedy
   in his Donnellan Lectures on Natural Theology and Modern Thought. He
   calls attention to the way in which this theory must, if true, affect
   our belief about the agency of God and the agency of the mind of man.
   "For the latter, the agency of the human mind," he says, "it leaves no
   room whatever. It tells us that, in attributing the railways and
   steamships and cotton-mills of the present day to the fertile mind of
   man, we have been making a mistake as great as that of the insane
   astronomer in Swift's satire, who had persuaded himself that it was his
   watchful care which guided the movement of the planets. The railways,
   steamships, and cotton-mills would have been constructed all the same,
   though we had no minds at all; just as the stars would have remained in
   their proper places, though the attention of the astronomer had been
   withdrawn from them. It was the boast of Comte that, to minds
   famliarised with the true astronomical philosophy, the heavens now
   declare no other glory than that of Hipparchus, Kepler, Newton, and all
   those who have contributed to the ascertainment of their laws; but if
   the doctrine of Automatism be true, it is the direct contrary of this
   which results; it is the glory of Hipparchus, Newton, and Kepler which
   is irretrievably destroyed. For the mind of Hipparchus was not the
   agent which made known to man the Precession of the Equinoxes; nor were
   the thoughts of Newton the cause of the writing of the Principia; nor
   did those of Kepler cause the enunciation, either by pen or voice, of
   the laws which bear his name. These philosophers were merely conscious
   automata; and had they been unconscious automata, the result would
   still have been the very same" (pp. 75, 76). This is no travesty of the
   doctrine, but a serious presentation of the results of the views
   advocated by Professor Huxley in his paper," The Hypothesis that
   Animals are Automata" (Fortnightly Review, November 1874, pp. 575,
   576). "It seems to me," says this distinguished scientific teacher,
   "that in men, as in brutes, there is no proof that any state of
   consciousness is the cause of change in the motion of the matter of the
   organism. If these positions are well based, it follows that our mental
   conditions are simply the symbols in consciousness of the changes which
   take place automatically in the organism; and that, to take an extreme
   illustration, the feeling we call volition is not the cause of a
   voluntary act, but the symbol of that state of the brain which is the
   immediate cause of that act. We are conscious automata," etc. It is
   difficult to see what place is left for virtue or responsibility in
   such a theory of man as this!
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE IV NOTE H.--P. 149.

  MIND AND CEREBRAL ACTIVITY.

   This subject is discussed with great care in Professor H. Calderwood's
   The Relations of Mind and Brain, with the result that a series of facts
   are established which I do not remember seeing brought out as
   convincingly anywhere else. The chief value of his book lies in the
   proof which it leads of the following positions, which I set here in
   order, with reference to passages in which they are discussed:--

   1. That the primary function of the brain is to serve, not as an organ
   of thought, but as an organ of sensory-motor activity (pp. 196, 290,
   302-307, 2nd ed.).

   2. That, as demonstrated by experiment, by far the greater part of the
   brain--if not all--is monopolised for sensory-motor work, leaving
   little, if any, of it to be employed for other purposes (pp. 302, 361).

   3. That in the comparison of animals there is no fixed ratio between
   degree of intelligence and complexity of brain structure--a highly
   developed and convoluted brain finding its chief explanation in " the
   much more complex muscular system to be controlled "(p. 149). "Advance
   in intelligence and advance in complexity of brain structure do not
   keep pace with each other; they are not correlated so as to harmonise"
   (p. 148). The dog, e.g., with a brain less elaborate in its
   convolutions, shows a higher degree of intelligence than the horse,
   with a more ample and complicated series of foldings in the
   convolutions of the grey matter. A number of leading cases are examined
   in detail in Chap. v. "Comparison of the Structure and Functions of
   Brain in Lower and Higher Forms of Animal Life" (pp. 123ff.). Cf. pp.
   260, 261.

   4. That the view that special cells are appropriated to mental
   functions,--as, e.g., the "mind-cells" of Hacokel (pp. 298-303), or the
   memory-cells of Professor Bain (pp. 356-364),--is not borne out, but is
   discredited by physiology. As against Haeckel, it presents "a
   cumulative body of evidence adverse to the hypothesis that human
   intelligence can be attributed to the giant pyramidal cells abounding
   in the fourth layer of the brain. All available evidence favours the
   conclusion that these giant cells are motor cells largely concerned in
   the functions of co-ordination of related intra-cerebral movements. It
   thus seems warrantable to infer that such co-ordinated movement takes
   rank as the highest function of brain. In accordance with this view is
   Dr. Ferrier's conclusion as to the frontal regions in the human brain,
   based on the whole range of experiments under electromotor excitation,
   "that they are inhibitory motor-centres' such as may be associated with
   an exercise of attention" (pp. 302, 303). As respects Bain's theory,
   "the known laws of cerebral activity do not favour such calculations as
   are suggested by Professor Bain. The space appropriated for the sensory
   and motor functions includes a great part of the mass of cellular
   tissue" (p. 360, see proof in detail). Generally, "physiology does not
   discover any new function in the higher part of the system, except more
   detailed ordination" (p. 297). "We must regard equally the frontal and
   the occipital regions of the grand central organ as concerned with
   sensory-activity and correlated motor-activity " (p. 316).

   5. That the true relation of mind and brain lies in the dependence of
   the former on the latter in sensory functions, and in the use made by
   the former (involved in all forms of mental activity) of the brain's
   motor functions. The following is an enumeration of forms of brain
   action which must be considered as generally attending on the more
   ordinary mental exercises: "(1) Action of the special senses, and of
   the more general tactile sense; (2) action of the muscles concerned in
   the management of these senses, and specially of the organs of sight;
   (3) co-ordination of sensory and motor apparatus required for use of
   the senses; (4) action of sensory centres consequent on use of
   imagination (p. 357), in part a renewal of sensory impressions, or a
   movement of sensory cells consequent upon stimulus which imagination
   supplies; (5) sensory and motor action consequent upon the stimulus
   coming from mental emotion, such as weeping, facial expression of
   sadness or sympathy . . . all these phases of brain action, as they
   involve active use of brain energy, imply transformation of energy,
   consequent waste of brain substance, and inevitable sense of
   exhaustion. . . . First, there is large use of both sensory and motor
   apparatus in connection with all the ordinary forms of intellectual
   activity. Second, all thought proceeds, to a large extent, by use of
   language, and thus seems to involve activity of the cells concerned
   with the acquisition and use of language and speech. Third,
   concentrated thought makes a severer demand upon all the forms of brain
   action connected with ordinary thought, and so quickens and increases
   the exhaustion of nerve energy" (pp. 412-415). This defines the sense
   in which the brain is the organ of mind, and shows that it is not the
   organ of mind in the same sense in which it is a sensory-motor organ
   (p. 315).

   6. That while the mind is thus manifoldly correlated with brain action,
   not only are mental-facts, as the highest authorities admit, absolutely
   distinguishable from brain-facts (pp. 292, 293, 314, 315); but the
   mental phenomena in man (even in sensation and consciousness of
   succession in sensations, in memory, language, still more in the higher
   mental functions, self-regulated voluntary activity, intellectual
   activities, thought on ultimate questions of existence, etc.) transcend
   brain action altogether, and are non-interpretable through it (pp.
   304-307, 366, 367, 385-396; Chap. xv. "The Higher Forms of Mental
   Activity"). "Mind transcends all the sensibilities of our organism. The
   whole range of our thoughts,--as we interpret events under the law of
   causality, form conceptions of rectitude, and represent to ourselves a
   scheme of the universe as a whole,--transcends all the functions of the
   nerve system. Known facts are in accordance with this duality;
   paralysis of a cerebral hemisphere may leave intelligence unaffected;
   though high intellectual life involves good brain development, high
   brain development does not necessarily involve a distinguished
   intellectual life; but the more highly educated a man is, so much the
   more does his life transcend what his bodily functions can accomplish"
   (p. 307).

   The result reached is--"that the intelligence of man, as known in
   personal consciousness, is of a nature entirely distinct from sensory
   apparatus, its functions being incapable of explanation in accordance
   with the laws of sensory activity. . . . The facts of consciousness
   lead to the conclusion that mind is a distinct order of existence,
   different in nature from the nerve system, differing in the mode of its
   action from the mechanical action of sensory apparatus, and capable of
   interpreting the rational sensibilities of our organism, so as thereby
   to discover a rational order in things external, or adaptation of
   related things in nature to rational purpose" (p. 307).

   In establishing these positions, Professor Calderwood at the same time
   refutes certain others, viz.:--

   1. The theory which identifies mind with brain action (pp.313, 314).

   2. The theory which supposes that there is an exact correspondence
   between the mental and physical facts,--or that, as Bain and Spencer
   put it, they are but two sides of the same thing (pp. 293-296). "That
   thieve is an absolute harmony involving a parallelism or
   correspondence, and making an exact equation of both organic and
   non-organic activity in all cases, it is quite impossible to maintain "
   (p. 316).

   3. The theory that mental phenomena can be translated into the language
   of brain changes, or expressed in terms of the motions, groupings, or
   electric discharges of the latter (pp. 314, 315).

   4. The view that mind does not act on the brain series to alter or
   modify it--"that action and reaction of nerve tissue carries the
   explanation of all that belongs to human life" (pp. 326-343). "It was
   inevitable that a theory reducing all human action to the play of nerve
   force should be propounded" (p. 336); but "(l) There is neither
   anatomical nor physiological evidence in support of the theory. . . .
   (3) The facts relied on as auxiliary to the theory do not in reality
   support it. . . . (4) The facts to be explained--voluntary control of
   muscular activity under guidance of intelligence--do not manifest
   resemblance to the known facts of nerve action, but present a decided
   contrast" (pp. 328, 329).

LECTURE IV NOTE I.--P. 152.

  SCHLEIERMACHER AND IMMORTALITY.

   In his earlier writings Schleiermacher undoubtedly speaks slightingly
   of personal immortality, and Dr. Martineau enlarges on this as if it
   were his whole view.--Study of Religion, ii. pp. 355-360. But in his
   Der christliche Glaube he takes much more positive ground. In sec. 157
   he distinguishes between "propositions of faith" and "propositions
   received on testimony," which, though their truth is not directly
   deducible from the contents of the Christian consciousness, are yet so
   intimately bound up with the credit of Christ and His witnesses, that
   we cannot refuse to accept them. Such, e.g., is the Resurrection of
   Christ Himself, which, as shown in an earlier section (sec. 99), is not
   directly involved in faith, but yet is to be received on testimony. It
   is not otherwise, in Schleiermacher's view, with immortality. Here also
   he takes the ground that personal immortality is not a doctrine so
   bound up with faith that a man cannot conceivably be a Christian, and
   yet deny it. For if there is an irreligious denial of personal
   immortality, there may also, he holds, be a denial of it springing from
   a worthy and indeed a religious motive. "If, therefore," he says, "any
   one in good faith should maintain that Christ's words, on this subject
   are to be taken figuratively, and not in their strict sense, and on
   this account should not attribute personal immortality to himself,
   faith in Christ, as such an one conceives of Him, certainly remains
   possible"; though, Q as he proceeds to explain, it would involve a
   complete transformation of Christianity if such a mode of
   interpretation should ever be established in the Church, or should be
   laid at the foundation of Christian faith (sec. 157, 2). But this is
   purely a hypothetical case. For in these consequences to Christianity,
   says Schleiermacher," it is already implied that we do not presuppose
   that such an interpretation can be made in good faith." It can be
   maintained " that faith in the continuance of our personality is bound
   up with faith m the Redeemer" (ibid.). He rejects all the natural
   arguments for immortality (sec. 158, 1), but he thinks it indubitable
   that Christ Himself taught His own immortality, and that of believers
   as united with Him in fellowship of life; and this conviction is
   therefore given to us as part of our faith in Christ (sec. 158, 2). It
   must, however, be admitted that this is an exceedingly weak ground on
   which to rest so weighty an article of faith; for assuredly faith will
   not long retain a doctrine for which it experiences no religious need,
   and which finds no support in the facts of human nature.

NOTES TO LECTURE V NOTE A.--P. 165.

  EFFECTS IN CREATION: AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THEISM.

   Lucretius already uses this argument. Even were he ignorant, he says,
   of the primordial causes of things, he could venture to affirm from the
   faultiness of the universe that it was not the work of Divine power.

     "Quod si jam rerum ignorem primordia quae sint,

     Hoc tamen ex ipsis caeli rationibus ausim

     Confirmare aliisque ex rebus reddere multis,

     Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam

     Naturam rerum; tanta stat praedita culpa."

     De.Rerum Natura, v. 195-190.

   Seneca held a view akin to Mill's. [899] Among his queries are these:
   "How far God's power extends; whether He forms His own matter, or only
   uses that which is given Him; whether He can do whatsoever He will, or
   the materials in many ways frustrate and disappoint Him, and things are
   formed badly by the great Artificer, not because His art fails, but
   because that on which it is exercised proves stubborn and
   intractable."--Quaest. Nat., Book i. Preface.

   Mr. Rathbone Greg seems in the end of his life to have come round to
   the views of Mr. Mill "Thoughtful minds in all ages," he says, "have
   experienced the most painful perplexities in the attempt to reconcile
   certain of the moral and physical phenomena we see around us with the
   assumption of a Supreme Being at once all-wise, all-good, and
   almighty." These difficulties, he thinks, are wholly gratuitous, and
   arise out of the inconsiderate and unwarranted use of a single
   word--omnipotent. Only grant that the Creator is "conditioned,
   hampered, it may be, by the attributes, qualities, and imperfections of
   the material on which He had to operate; bound possibly by laws or
   properties inherent in the nature of that material,"--and "it becomes
   possible to believe in and to worship God without doing violence to our
   moral sense, or denying or distorting the sorrowful facts that surround
   our daily life."--Preface to Enigmas of Life (18th edition).

   The Pessimists, of course, lay stress on what they consider the evil
   and defects of nature, as proving that it cannot have proceeded from an
   intelligent cause. Hartmann is quoted by Strauss as saying that "if
   God, before creation, had possessed consciousness, creation would have
   been an inexpiable crime; its existence is only pardonable as the
   result of blind will."--Der alte und der neue Glaube, p. 223.

   Comte and Helmholtz have urged the defects of nature as disproving
   design. See their views criticised in Flint's Theism, Lect. viii.;
   Janet's Final Causes, p. 45 (Eng. trans.); Kennedy's Nat. Theol. and
   Modern Thought, pp. 130-134; Row's Christian Theism, chap. ix., etc.

   Mr. S. Laing urges the undeniable existence of evil in the world as a
   fact irreconcilable with that of an almighty and beneficent Creator,
   and takes refuge in an ultimate law of "polarity," i.e. dualism.--A
   Modern Zoroastrian, pp. 170-183 (see next note).

   Maudsley writes: "The facts of organic and human nature, when observed
   frankly and judged without bias, do not warrant the argument of a
   supreme and beneficent artificer working after methods of human
   intelligence, but perfect in all his works; rather would they warrant,
   if viewed from the human standpoint, the conception of an almighty
   malignant power that was working out some far-off end of its own, with
   the serenest disregard of the suffering, expenditure, and waste which
   were entailed in the process."--Body and Will, pp. 180, 181.

   There is much that is exaggerated, jaundiced, and subjective in these
   complaints, but they point to the existence of great and terrible evils
   in the world, which Theism must boldly face, and do justice to in some
   way in its view of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [899] Mill's views are indicated in the text. They are further
   discussed by me in two papers in The Theological Monthly (July and
   August 1891) on "J. S. Mill and Christianity. "
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE V NOTE B.--P. 175.

  DUALISTIC THEORIES OF THE ORIGIN OF EVIL.

   The hypothesis of two principles in the universe finds classical
   expression in the Zoroastrian religion. Cf. on this Ebrard's Christian
   Apologetics, ii. pp. 186-232. Mr. S. Laing makes an attempt at a
   revival of the theory in his book, A Modern Zoroastrian, under the name
   of a law of polarity." He would have us devote ourselves with a whole
   heart and sincere mind to the worship of the good principle, without
   paltering with our moral nature by professing to love and adore a Being
   who is the author of all the evil and misery in the world as well as of
   the good"; and holds that a great deal of: what is best in Christianity
   "resolves itself very much into the worship of Jesus as the Ormuzd, or
   personification of the good principle, and determination to try to
   follow His example and do His work" (pp. 179, 180).

   There is a deceptive simplicity in this idea of dividing off the good
   and evil of the world into different departments, giving all the good
   to a good principle, and all the evil to an evil principle, which may
   impose for a moment on the mind, yet the slightest reflection should
   suffice to show the crudeness and untenableness of the hypothesis.

   In respect of physical evil, no such sharp division into good and evil
   is possible. Rather the terms are relative, and what is good in one
   relation is evil in another. Good and evil are often simply questions
   of degree; the susceptibility to pleasure is involved in the
   susceptibility to pain, and vice versa. Thus the same nerve which feels
   pleasure feels pain; the one susceptibility is involved in the other.
   Pleasure and pain shade into each other by insensible gradations. If,
   e.g., I approach my hands to the fire, I feel a grateful warmth; if I
   bring them nearer, I am scorched. It is the same sun which fructifies
   the fields in one part of the world, and burns up the herbage or smites
   with sunstroke in another. On the hypothesis in question, the sun's
   heat would belong in the one case to the good, in the other to the evil
   principle; so with the fire, etc.

   In respect of physical evil, a self-subsisting evil principle is an
   impossible abstraction. Moral evil is a term which has no meaning
   except in relation to character and will; and a character or will
   cannot be evil, unless along with the evil there is some knowledge of
   the good. [900] Natural forces, as heat and electricity, are neither
   good nor evil, for there is no knowledge. Bound up, therefore, with the
   evil principle, there must be some knowledge of the good, else it would
   not be evil. But a principle which participates in the knowledge of the
   good cannot be originally or essentially evil, but can only have become
   such through its own choice. Evil, in other words, has no reality, save
   as the negation or antithesis of the good, which is its necessary
   presupposition. Abstracted from knowledge of the good, the so-called
   evil principle sinks to the rank of a mere nature principle, of which
   neither good nor evil can properly be predicated. This is ultimately
   the reason why in dualistic systems natural and moral evil always tend
   to be confounded.

  HEGEL'S DOCTRINE OF SIN.

   Hegel's view, as stated in his Religionsphilosophie, may be briefly
   summed up thus:--

   1. Evil exists by a metaphysical necessity. "The notion must realise
   itself. . . . Man is essentially spirit; but spirit does not arise in
   an immediate way. It is essential to spirit to be for itself, to be
   free, to oppose itself to naturalness, to raise itself out of its state
   of immersion in nature, to set itself at variance with nature, and
   first through and by this variance to reconcile itself with nature, and
   not only with nature, but with its own essence, with its truth."--Vol.
   i. p. 268.

   2. As respects his original condition, man exists first in a state of
   pure naturalness. It is hardly correctly named even a state of
   innocence, for innocence implies moral ideas, whereas this is a state
   "in which there is for man neither good nor evil; it is the state of
   the animal, of lack of knowledge, in which man knows nothing of either
   good or evil, in which what he wills is not determined either as the
   one or the other; for if he does not know evil, neither does he know
   good....In truth, that first state of mere existence in unity with
   nature is not a condition of innocence, but of rudeness, of appetite,
   of barbarism generally."Vol. i. p. 269.

   3. As respects man's essential nature in this state, two opposite
   definitions are to be given--Man is by nature good; and man is by
   nature bad. To affirm "that man is by nature good, is essentially to
   say that man is spirit in himself, is rationality; he is created with
   and after the image of God. . . . The other statement arises from what
   has been said, that man must not remain as he is immediately, but must
   transcend his immediateness. . . . His being-in-self, his naturality is
   the evil. . . . He is evil for this reason, that he is a natural
   being...The absolute demand is that man shall not remain as a mere
   natural being,--not as mere natural will. Man has indeed consciousness;
   but he can, even as man, remain a mere natural being, in so far as he
   makes the natural the aim, content, and determination of his
   will."--Vol. ii. pp. 258-260.

   4. That through which the transition is effected from the natural to
   the moral state is knowledge. With the awakening of consciousness, man
   recognises that he is not what he ought to be; hence arises the sense
   of sin, the pain of discord, of contradiction with himself. As the
   Bible has it, man becomes evil by eating of the tree of knowledge. "In
   this representation lies the connection of evil with knowledge. This is
   an essential point. . . . Man's nature is not what it should be, and it
   is knowledge which acquaints him with this and sets before him the fact
   of his being as he ought not to be. . . . It is not that consideration
   (knowledge) has an external relation to evil, but the consideration
   itself is the evil. Man, since he is spirit, has to proceed to this
   opposition, in order to he altogether for himself," etc.--Vol. ii. pp.
   263-265.

   It is the annulling of this self-redemption in man--represented as an
   essential stage in his development--which constitutes, according to
   Hegel, the atonement.

  RITSCHL'S DOCTRINE OF GUILT.

   See a searching examination of Ritschl's doctrine on this subject in
   Dorner's System of Doctrine, iv. pp. 60-72 (Eng. trans.). Cf. also
   Pfleiderer's Die Ritschl'sche Theologie, pp. 63, 69, 70; Bertrand's Une
   nouvelle Conception de la Redemption, pp. 256-273; Stahlin's Kant,
   Lotze, und Ritschl, pp. 210-212, 227.

   All these writers agree that the logical effect of Ritschl's doctrine
   is to reduce guilt to a subjective illusion. This is borne out by the
   following particulars of his system:--

   1. By the denial to God of everything of the nature of punitive
   justice. In so far as the sinner's guilty fears lead him to represent
   God as angry with him, or as visiting him with punishment, he is
   tormenting himself with needless apprehensions. Punitive justice is a
   conception borrowed from the sphere of civil right, and has no
   application in the sphere of the Divine. He teaches expressly that
   "external evils can only be reckoned as Divine punishments from the
   point of view of the subjective consciousness of guilt."--Recht. und
   Ver. iii pp. 346.

   2. By his doctrine of reconciliation. Reconciliation is defined as the
   removal of the separation which has come to exist between man and God
   in consequence of sin; and as it is the consciousness of guilt which
   keeps sinners far from God, pardon consists essentially in the removal
   of this guilt--consciousness (iii. p. 52). But this is not to be
   understood as if in this removal of guilt anything objective took p
   lace. Rather Christ's work was, as Dorner expresses it, "to reveal God
   to us as fatherly love, and scatter the gloomy terrors of an angry God
   and a punitive justice"; "to give deliverance from these erroneous
   notions of God's retributive and specially punitive.justice, which
   interfere with Divine communion."--System of Doctrine, iv. p. 71.

   3. The doctrine of guilt is attenuated on another side by Ritschl's
   view that all existing sin is sin committed in ignorance. It is on this
   ground that he declares it pardonable. But here again pardon does not
   mean the laying aside of any real displeasure on the part of God, but
   solely the removal of the sinner's (groundless) guilty fears. The one
   sin which Ritschl exempts from pardon is that of definitive unbelief--a
   problematical transgression which he thinks we have no reason to
   suppose ever existed. Here Ritschl's doctrine falls into an obvious
   inconsistency. He holds that if such a sin did exist, the one way the
   Divine Being could deal with it would be by annihilating the sinner.
   But surely this would be an exercise of punitive justice, if anything
   is; yet Ritschl denies that punitive justice resides at all in God. On
   the whole, there is good ground for Dorner's charge, that "no clear,
   connected doctrine respecting punishment, God's punitive justice, moral
   freedom, and guilt, is to be found in Ritschl" (iv. p. 67).

  ALLEGED PRIMITIVE SAVAGERY OF MANKIND.

   The hypothesis of man's original savagery rests on certain unproved
   assumptions.

   I. So far as it is a deduction from the law of evolution, it rests on
   the unproved assumption that man has developed by slow gradations from
   the condition of the animal. See on this the passages quoted in
   footnote to the Lecture, p. 182.

   II. As respects existing savages, the hypothesis--

   1. Rests on the unproved assumption that the state of existing savages
   represents (or most nearly represents) that of primitive man. [901] Of
   late, says Max Muller, there has been a strong reaction in the study of
   uncivilsed races. "First of all, it has been shown that it was
   certainly a mistake to look upon the manners and customs, the legends
   and religious ideas, of uncivilised tribes as representing an image of
   what the primitive state of mankind must have been thousands of years
   ago, or what it actually was long before the be ginning of the earliest
   civilisation, as known to us from historical documents. The more savage
   a tribe, the more accurately was it supposed to reflect the primitive
   state of man-kind. This was no doubt a very natural mistake, before
   more careful researches had shown that the customs of savage races were
   often far more artificial and complicated than they appeared at first,
   and that there had been as much progression and retrogression in their
   historical development as in that of more civilised races. We know now
   that savage and primitive are very far indeed from meaning the same
   thing."--Anthrop. Religion, pp. 149, 150.

   Evidence is constantly accumulating, that behind the existing condition
   of savage races there stood a state of higher culture and civilisation.
   E.g. Dr. Tylor says: "Dr. Bastian has lately visited New Zealand and
   the Sandwich Islands, and gathered some interesting information as to
   native traditions. The documents strengthen the view which for years
   has been growing up among anthropologists as to the civilisation of the
   Polynesians. It is true that they were found in Captain Cook's time
   living in a barbaric state, and their scanty clothing and want of
   metals led superior observers to class them as savages; but their
   beliefs and customs show plainly traces of descent from ancestors who
   in some way shared the higher culture of the Asiatic nations."--Nature,
   1881, p. 29. Tylor's own pages furnish ample evidence of similar
   retrogression of the African and other tribes.--Primitive Culture, pp.
   42, 43. On the extinct civilisations of Mexico and Peru, the
   mound-builders of the Mississippi Valley, and other evidences of
   earlier culture in America, see Reville's Hibbert Lectures, 1884, The
   Native Religions of Mexico and Peru; Dawson's Fossil Men and their
   Modern Representatives; Argyll's Unity of Nature, pp. 429-437.

   A fact of the greatest importance here is that pointed out by the Duke
   of Argyll, viz, that the degraded races of the world are those farthest
   from the centres of distribution of population. "It is a fact," he
   says, "that the lowest and rudest tribes in the population of the globe
   have been found, as we have seen, at the farthest extremities of its
   larger continents, or in the distant islands of its great oceans, or
   among the hills and forests which in every land have been the last
   refuge of the victims of violence and misfortune."--Unity of Nature, p.
   426. See for illustrations, chap. x. of this work.

   Whately's statement stands yet un-overturned. "Facts," he says, "are
   stubborn things; and that no authenticated instance can be produced of
   savages that ever did emerge unaided from that state is no theory, but
   a statement, hitherto never disproved, of a. matter of fact."--Exeter
   Hall Lecture on the Origin of Civilisation.

   2. It overlooks the higher elements which exist even in the present
   condition of savages. See these brought out as respects the African
   tribes, on the basis of Waltz's Anthropology, in Max Muller's Hibbert
   Lectures, 1878, On the Origin and Growth of Religion, pp. 106-113.

   III. As respects prehistoric man, the main points are noticed in the
   Lectures.

   1. Here, again, the assumption is unproved that these cave-men, etc.,
   on whose rudeness the argument was founded, represented primitive man,
   and were not rather a degradation of an earlier type. Against this
   assumption is the fact of their distance from what seem to have been
   the original centres of distribution of the race, combined with the
   very different spectacle which mankind presents as we approach these
   centres. On the argument based on the antiquity of prehistoric man, see
   Note U., and cf. Reusch's Nature and the Bible, ii. pp. 265-366 (Eng.
   trans.).

   2. Many erroneous inferences may be drawn from stone implements and the
   like as to the intellectual and moral calibre of the people using them.
   See on this the most suggestive treatment in Sir Arthur Mitchell's
   Rhind Lectures on "Past and Present," and "What is Civilisation?" (1876
   and 1878).

   3. The greatest civilisations of antiquity do not show traces of an
   earlier period of barbarism. These civilisations certainly did not
   spring into existence ready-formed, but there is nothing to indicate
   any such slow rise from an antecedent state of savagery as the modern
   hypothesis supposes. This is peculiarly the case with the oldest
   civilisation--that of Egypt. "In Egypt," says Canon Rawlinson, "it is
   notorious that there is no indication of any early period of savagery
   or barbarism. All the authorities agree that, however far we go back,
   we find in Egypt no rude or uncivilised time out of which civilisation
   is developed." Origin of Nations, p. 13. [902] The same writer says of
   Babylon: "In Babylon there is more indication of early rudeness. But,
   on the other hand, there are not wanting signs of an advanced state of
   certain arts, even in the earliest times, which denote a high degree of
   civilisation, and contrast most curiously with the indications of
   rudeness here spoken of" (ibid. p. 14). This progress of discovery in
   ancient Babylonia has carried back civilisation, and a high development
   of the arts (as of writing), to a quite unthought-of antiquity (e.g. at
   Nipur).

  EARLY MONOTHEISTIC IDEAS.

   It has been shown (Note A. to Lecture III.--Primitive Fetishism and
   Ghost Worship) that man's earliest religious ideas were not his
   poorest. It may now be affirmed that his earliest ideas were in some
   respects his highest--that the consciousness of the one God was with
   him in the dawn of his history, and has never been wholly extinguished
   since.

   Ebrard, after an exhaustive examination of ancient religions, thus sums
   up: "We have nowhere been able to discover the least trace of any
   forward and upward movement from Fetishism to Polytheism, and from that
   again to a gradually advancing knowledge of the one God; but, on the
   contrary, we have found among all peoples of the heathen world a most
   decided tendency to sink from an earlier and relatively purer knowledge
   of God."--Christ. Apol. iii. p. 317 (Eng. trans.).

   The ancient Egyptian religion was at heart monotheistic. M. de Rouge
   says: "The Egyptian religion comprehends a quantity of local
   worships....Each of these regions has its principal god designated by a
   special name; but it is always the same doctrine which reappears under
   different names. One idea predominates, that of a single and primeval
   God; everywhere and always it is one substance, self-existent, and an
   unapproachable God." (Quoted by Renouf, p. 90.) This, he says, was the
   doctrine of the Egyptians in the earliest period. M. Renouf confirms
   this statement. "It is incontestably true," he testifies,"that the
   sublimer portions of the Egyptian religion are not the comparatively
   late result of a process of development or elimination from the
   grosser. The sublimer portions are demonstrably ancient; and the last
   stage of the Egyptian religion, that known to the Greek and Latin
   writers, heathen or Christian, was by far the grossest and most
   corrupt."--Hibbert Lectures, p. 91.

   The early Babylonian religion was polytheistic; but here also the
   monotheistic consciousness breaks through in the exalted predicates
   applied to the great gods by their respective worshippers. Each god
   seems at first to have been worshipped by its own city as supreme--the
   moon-god at Ur; the sun-god at Sippara; Ann, the sky, at Erech; Ea, the
   deep, at Eridu; Nebo at Borsippa, etc. Thus the moon-god was celebrated
   as the "lord and prince of the gods, who in heaven and earth alone is
   supreme"; Nebo, in the belief of his worshippers, was the supreme god,
   the creator of the world; Anu, the sky--god, became a supreme god, the
   lord and father of the universe, then "the one god" into whom all the
   other deities were resolved; Asshur developed peculiarly exalted
   traits. "We can, in fact," says Professor Sayce, "trace in him all the
   lineaments upon which under other conditions there might have been
   built up as pure a faith as that of the God of Israel"--Sayce's Hibbert
   Lectures, 1887, p. 129; cf. pp. 116, 160, 191, etc. Others go farther,
   and see in Ilu--Heb. El "the Babylonian supreme deity," cf. Schrader,
   Keilinschriften, i. p. 11 (Eng. trans.); and conclude, with Duncker and
   Lenormant, that the Babylonians in the earliest times worshipped one
   god, El, Ilu. (In Ebrard, ii. p. 330.)

   The religion of the Vedas in India, in like manner, is purer than the
   later Hindu developments, and points back, through philology, to an
   earlier stage still, when the Polytheism of the Vedas was as yet
   non-existent. "Behind the Homeric poems," says Dr. Fairbairn, "and the
   Vedas, and the separation of the Iranic-Indian branches, lies the
   period when Colt and Teuton, Anglo-Saxon and Indian, Greek and Roman,
   Scandinavian and Iranian, lived together, a simple, single people.
   . . . Excluding the coincidences natural to related peoples developing
   the same germs, we find two points of radical and general
   agreement--the proper name of one God, and the term expressive of the
   idea of God in general. . . . A name for God had thus been formed
   before the dispersion. . . . The result is a Theism which we may name
   individualistic."--Studies in the Phil. of Religion, pp. 22-29; "The
   younger the Polytheism, the fewer its gods," p. 22.

   Ebrard says: "Immediately after the separation of the Iranians and
   Indians, that is, during the first Vedic period, the consciousness was
   fully present among the Indians that the Adityas did not represent a
   multitude of separate deities in a polytheistic and mythological sense,
   but only the fulness of the creative powers of the one God, and that
   the holy God, and that in each of these Adityas it was always the one
   God who was worshipped. And the farther back we go into the past, the
   more distinct do we find the consciousness among the Indians. In the
   second, the Indra period, it dwindles away, and gives place to a
   polytheistic conception."--Christ. Apol. ii pp. 213, 214. He finds the
   common root of the Indian and Iranian religions in "a primitive
   Monotheism, or Elohism, as we might call it, since there is no real
   distinction between the Elohim and the Adityas" (p. 214). The Iranian
   religion in the form in which we find it in the Zend-Avesta
   (Zoroastrian) is dualistic; but the conception of Ahura-Mazda, as we
   find it in the earlier portions, is so exalted that it may almost be
   called monotheistic. It unquestionably springs from the common Aryan
   root indicated above.

   Herodotus has the striking statement that the ancient Pelasgi, the
   early inhabitants of Greece, gave no distinct names to the gods, but
   prayed to them collectively. "They called them gods, because they had
   set in order and ruled all things." But as for the special names
   attached to them, and the functions severally assigned to them--all
   this, he thinks, goes no farther back than Homer and Hesiod. "These
   framed a theogony for the Greeks, and gave names to the gods, and
   assigned to them honours and arts, and declared their several forms"
   (ii 52, 53). Max Muller does not hesitate to say, following Welcker:
   "When we ascend to the most distant heights of Greek history, the idea
   of God as the Supreme Being stands before us as a simple fact."--Chips,
   ii. p. 157. This strain of Monotheism in the religion of the Greeks is
   never absolutely lost, but reappears in the beliefs of the
   philosophers, the' Orphic mysteries, and the lofty conceptions of the
   great tragic poets. Plutarch, in like manner, tells of the early
   religion of the Romans, that it was imageless and spiritual Their
   religious lawgiver, Numa, he says, "forbade the Romans to represent the
   deity in the form either of man or of beast. Nor was there among them
   formerly any image or statue of the Divine Being; during the first one
   hundred and seventy years they built temples, indeed, and other sacred
   domes, but placed in them no figure of any kind; persuaded that. it is
   impious to represent things Divine by what is perishable, and that we
   can have no conception of God but by the understanding." Lives, on
   Numa. The legendary form of the tradition need not lead us to doubt
   that it embodies a substantial truth.

   On this subject see Ebrard's Christian Apologetics; Loring Brace's The
   Unknown God; Pressense's The Ancient World and Christianity (Eng.
   trans.); Vigouroux's La Bible et les Decouvertes modernes, lii.--"On
   Primitive Monotheism"; Rawlinson's Tract on "The Early Prevalence of
   Monotheistic Beliefs," in Present Day Tracts (No. 11), etc.

LECTURE 5 NOTE G.--P. 185

  THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN AND GEOLOGICAL TIME.

   In illustration of the tendency in recent science greatly to restrict
   the period formerly claimed for man's antiquity, the following passages
   may be cited from an able article on the Ice Age in The Edinburgh
   Review for April 1892, based on Dr. Wright's Ice Age in North America,
   and its bearings on the Antiquity of Man (1890). [903]

   "The Falls of Niagara," says this writer, "indeed constitute of
   themselves in Dr. Wright's apt phrase, a glacial chronometer.' Much
   trouble has been bestowed upon its accurate rating; and repeated
   trigonometrical surveys since 1842 afford so sure a basis for
   calculation, that serious error in estimating, from the amount of work
   done, the time consumed in doing it need no longer be
   apprehended....The average rate of recession, arrived at through
   careful weighing of these and other analogous facts, is five feet per
   annum, or nearly a mile in a thousand years. Hence from seven to eight
   thousand years have elapsed since the foam of Niagara rose through the
   air at Queenston; and the interval might even be shortened by taking
   into account some evidences of pre-glacial erosion by a local stream,
   making it probable that from the whirlpool downward the cutting of the
   gorge proceeded more rapidly than it does now. The date of the close of
   the Glacial Epoch in the United States can scarcely then be placed
   earlier than 6000 B.C. . . .

   "Their testimony does not stand alone. . . . Pre-glacially, it [the
   Mississippi] followed a wide bend from Minneapolis to Fort Snelling;
   now it flows straight across the intervening eight miles to its
   junction with the Minnesota. On its way it leaps the Falls of St.
   Anthony; and the rate of their retreat since 1680, exactly determined
   from the observation of Father Hennequin, proves them to be about eight
   thousand three hundred years old. This second glacial timepiece
   accordingly, which, owing to Its more southerly position was started
   earlier than the first, gives substantially the same reading. . . . The
   ravines and cascades of Ohio, studied by Dr. Wright, agree with the two
   great Falls in giving a comparatively recent overthrow of the ice
   regime. The unworn condition of the glacial deposits, the sharpness of
   glacial groovings, above all, the insignificant progress made by the
   silting up of glacial lakes, testify as well, and in some cases quite
   definitely, to a short lapse of time.

   "But if the Ice Age in America terminated--as we seem bound to
   admit--less than ten thousand years ago, so, beyond question, did the
   Ice Age in Europe. There is no possibility of separating the course of
   glacial events in each continent. The points of agreement are too many;
   the phenomena too nearly identical in themselves and in their sequence.
   Elevation and depression of continents, the formation, retreat, and
   second advance of the ice-sheet, the accompaniment of its melting by
   tremendous floods, the extermination of the same varieties of animals,
   the appearance and obliteration of Palaeolithic man, all preserved
   identical mutual relations in the Old and New Worlds. . . . The point
   has an important bearing upon the vexed question of the antiquity of
   man," etc. --Edinburgh Review, April 1892, pp. 315-319.

   The same view was advocated by Mr. P. F. Kendall in a paper prepared by
   Mr. Gray and himself on "The. Cause of the Ice-Age," read in the
   Geological Section of the British Association, August 4, 1892. He said:
   "Another fact of great importance bearing upon this question was the
   exceedingly recent date of the glacial period. It was the custom of
   geologists not long ago to talk about the glacial period as perhaps a
   quarter of a million years ago, or, at all events, to make a very
   liberal use of thousands and hundreds of thousands of years. But now it
   was found that all the physical evidence was in favour of a very recent
   departure of the ice. They could, for instance, put the date of the
   commencement of the great cut of the Niagara Falls at the close of the
   glacial period, and other like evidence in America pointed clearly to
   the recency of the departure of the ice."--Scotsman Report, August 5.
   The remainder of the paper was an examination of the theories of the
   late Dr. Croll, Dr. Wall, and Mr. Warren Upham, and the exposition by
   the authors of a theory of their own connected with the variability in
   the heat of the sun. Sir Archibald Geikie, in his President's Address
   at the same meeting of the British Association, while himself putting
   in a plea for longer periods on the ground of the geological record,
   grants that the recent drift of physical science has been enormously to
   reduce the unlimited drafts on time formerly made by geologists. Lord
   Kelvin "was inclined, when first dealing with the subject, to believe
   that, from a review of all the evidence then available, some such
   period as one hundred million years would embrace the whole of the
   geological history of the globe. . . . But physical inquiry continued
   to be pushed forward with regard to the early history and antiquity of
   the earth. Further consideration of the influence of tidal rotation in
   retarding the earth's rotation, and of the sun's rate of cooling, led
   to sweeping reductions of the time allowable for the evolution of the
   planet. The geologist found himself in the plight of Lear when his
   bodyguard of one hundred knights was cut down. What need you
   five-and-twenty, ten, or five? demands the inexorable physicist, as he
   remorselessly strikes slice after slice from his allowance of
   geological time. Lord Kelvin, I believe, is willing to grant us some
   twenty millions of years, but Professor Tait would have us content with
   less than ten millions."--Report of Address. One argument of Professor
   Geikie for lengthening the time is the extreme slowness with which, on
   the evolution hypothesis, the changes in species have been brought
   about--a very distinct petitio principii. It is worth while in this
   connection to note his admission: "So too with the plants and the
   higher animals which still survive. Some forms have become extinct, but
   few or none which remain display any transitional gradations into new
   species."

   Professor Tait's own words are: "I daresay many of you are acquainted
   with the speculations of Lyell and others, especially of Darwin, who
   tell us that even for a comparatively brief portion of recent
   geological history three hundred millions of years will not
   suffice.--Origin of Species, 1859, p. 287. We say: So much the worse
   for geology as at present understood by its chief authorities; for, as
   you will presently see, physical considerations from independent points
   of view render it utterly impossible that more than ten or fifteen
   millions of years can be granted."--Recent Advances in Physical
   Science, pp. 167, 168. "From this point of view we are led to a limit
   of something like ten millions of years as the utmost we can give to
   geologists for their speculations as to the history even of the lowest
   orders of fossils" (p. 167).

  THE CONNECTION OF SIN AND DEATH.

   Ritschl agrees with the modern view in dissolving the connection
   between human death and sin. Paul, indeed, he grants, affirms this
   connection; but the mere fact that this thought was formed by an
   apostle does not make it a rule for us (Recht. und Ver. iii. pp. 341,
   342). An able article appeared in the Revue de Theologie (Montauban),
   July 1882, on "Physical Death and Sin," by M. Charles Ducasse, which
   may be referred to as in agreement with, and confirmatory of, the
   positions taken up in the Lecture. The writer speaks of the problem
   created by the appearance of death in the world before sin. Before the
   appearance of man on the earth, death reigned; death was the law even
   of the organic world. He shows that from the first death entered into
   the Divine plan for the lower creation--is implied in what the Bible
   says of the reproduction of plants and animals, in the command given to
   Adam, etc. But he finds no contradiction in the thought that a new
   order of things should enter with man. Man forms part of nature. The
   roots of his organism penetrate into the past of other beings, and of
   the material world. But is man only a superior animal? Does not a new
   kingdom appear in him? The terminating point of the organic world, is
   he not equally the point of departure of the world of spirit, of
   reason, of morality? He is the bond of union between the world of
   nature and the Divine world. Why, then, should it not have been
   precisely his vocation to spiritualise matter, and lead it up to the
   conquest of new attributes? What hinders us from affirming that man was
   placed here to acquire corporeal immortality, and that, if he had not
   sinned, he would have been able to graft eternal life in his body on
   changeable and transient matter? This view, he thinks, agrees with both
   Scripture and science. Impartial science brings out the almost complete
   identity or our organism with that of the animals, but it establishes
   not less decisively the originality of our mental being, the
   superiority of our faculties of reason. The human kingdom constitutes
   in its eyes a kingdom by itself. There is, then, nothing improbable in
   the supposition that originally and in the plan of God the conditions
   of death for man were different from those for animals. The actual
   death of man would still in this view be the consequence of his sin;
   and this is in full accord with the Biblical teaching.

   See also a suggestive treatment of this subject in Dr. Matheson's Can
   the Old Faith Live with the New? pp. 206-218.

LECTURE VI NOTE A.--P. 220.

  THE DOCTRINE OF PRE-EXISTENCE.

   Themore recent theology admits the application of the notion of
   pre-existence to Christ in the New Testament, but explains it out of
   current Jewish modes of thought on this subject. See on this Harnack's
   Dogmengeschichte, i. pp.89-93, 710-719; Baldensperger's Das
   Selbstbewusstsein Jesu, pp. 85-92 (2nd edition); Bornemaunn's
   Unterricht im Christenthum, pp. 92-96, etc. According to these writers,
   the conception of pre-existence was a current one in the Rabbinical
   schools and in apocalyptic literature. Not only distinguished persons,
   as Adam, Enoch, Moses, but distinguished objects, as the tabernacle,
   the temple, the tables of the law, were figured as having had heavenly
   archetypes, i.e. as pre-existent. Various causes are assigned for this
   mode of representation:--

   1. There is the desire to express the inner worth of a valued object in
   distinction from its inadequate empirical form, which leads to the
   essence being hypostatised, and raised above space and time (Harnack).

   2. There is the conversion of an " end " into a " cause "--this
   specially in the case of persons (the Messiah), peoples (Israel), a
   collective body (the Church). "Where something which appears later was
   apprehended as the end of a series of dispositions, it was not
   unfrequently hypostatised, and made prior to these arrangements in
   point of time; the conceived end was placed in a kind of real existence
   before the means through which it was destined to be realised on earth,
   as an original cause of them."--Harnack, pp. 89, 90.

   3. There is the thought of predestination, which leads to an ideal
   pre-existence being realistically conceived as an actual one
   (Baldensperger).

   This category, existing in Jewish circles, was, it is thought, simply
   taken over and applied to Christ, believed In as the Messiah, risen and
   exalted to heaven. In this way, Harnack thinks, the first Christians
   "went beyond the expressions developed out of the Messianic
   consciousness of Jesus Himself respecting His Person, and sought
   notionally and speculatively to grasp the worth and absolute
   significance of His Person" (p. 90). [904] "The thought of
   preexistence," says Bornemann, "was not supernaturally communicated to
   the apostles, nor was formed for the first time by Paul, nor generally
   was unusual in that time; but we have to do here with a self-evident
   application to Jesus of an attribute already firmly established in
   Judaism as belonging to the Messiah."--Unterricht, p. 93. In short, the
   predicate of pre-existence was only one of several ways which the early
   Church took to express its sense of the abiding worth and felt mystery
   of the Person of Jesus. Bornemann mentions three of these--1. The
   supernatural birth; 2. The thought of pre-existence; 3. The incarnation
   of the eternal Divine Word of Revelation "ideas," he says, "subsisting
   independently of each other, and alongside of each other, as distinct
   but disparate attempts to ground the mystery of the life of Jesus in
   its Divine origin" (p. 92).

   It appears from this that the application of the category of
   preexistence to Jesus was a mere deduction of faith on the part of the
   first disciples--the application to Rim, as Bornemann says, of one of
   "the religious and philosophical notions and forms of Vorstellung'
   generally current in that time,"--and is therefore of no normative
   value for the Church to-day. I presume that not one of the writers I
   have quoted holds that Christ really pre-existed as the apostles
   thought He did. Before we accept this view, we would require to be
   satisfied of several things:--

   1. That this Rabbinical mode of representation was really so widely
   current as is alleged, and that it was indeed the source from which the
   apostles derived their belief in Christ's eternal pre-existence.

   2. That this belief had not its origin in very distinct utterances of
   Christ Himself, proceeding from the depths of His Divine self-knowledge
   (John viii. 58, xvii. 5, etc.).

   3. That there is a true analogy between the New Testament conception of
   Christ's pre-existence and this Rabbinical notion. The Jewish notion,
   according to Harnack, was that " the earthly things pre-exist with God
   just as they appear on earth, with all the material properties of their
   being " (p. 710). They do not exist eternally--at least the Law (which
   was exalted most highly of all) did not (two thousand years before the
   creation of the world, the Rabbis said). But Christ (1) exists from
   eternity; (2) as a Divine Person with the Father; (3) one in nature
   amid glory with the Father; (4) His Divine nature is distinguished from
   His humanity which He assumed in time; (5) His appearance on earth is
   the result of a voluntary act of self-abnegation and love--an ethical
   act. It is only confusing things that differ to pretend that the
   Rabbinical absurdities alluded to explain a Christian doctrine like
   this.

   4. Many special facts testify against the sufficiency of this
   explanation.

   (1) The support sought for it in the New Testament is of the most
   flimsy character, e.g. Gal. iv. 26; Heb. xii. 22; Rev. xxi. 2.

   (2) It is admitted that " the representations of a pre-existent Messiah
   in Judaism were in no way very widespread " (Harnack, p.. 89), and that
   they do not appear in all the New Testament writings. In truth, the
   writings in which they do appear are not specially the; Jewish ones,
   but those in which scholars have thought they detected most traces of
   Hellenistic influence.'

   (3) It is plain that in the writings in which they do appear, these
   Jewish modes of thought were not dominant. Paul, e.g., regards
   believers as eternally chosen and foreordained in Christ to salvation;
   but he does not attribute to them any such pre-existence as he ascribes
   to Christ. On this hypothesis, he ought to have done so.

   I cannot therefore accept this new theory as adequate to the facts. Nor
   do I believe that the apostles were left simply to their own gropings
   and imaginings in this and other great matters of the Christian faith.
   I take it as part of the Christian view that they were guided by the
   Spirit of Revelation into the truth which they possessed, and that
   their teachings laid the foundations of doctrine for the Church in all
   time.

LECTURE 6 NOTE B.--P. 288.

  PHILO AND THE FOURTH GOSPEL.

   The most diverse opinions prevail as to the extent to which the Fourth
   Gospel and other books of the New Testament have been influenced by the
   Alexandrian philosophy--some, like Harnack and Weiss, denying its
   presence altogether; others, like Pfleiderer, seeing its influence in
   John, Hebrews, Ephesians, and Colossians etc. It will put the matter in
   a clearer light if we look briefly, first, at Philo's own philosophy,
   and at the sources from which it was derived.

   The three main sources of Philo's philosophy were Platonism, Stoicism,
   and the Old Testament.

   1. From Plato, the chief contribution was the theory of ideas--of an
   ideal or noetic world in the Divine mind, after the pattern of which
   this visible world was made (cf. the Timaus). It is to be observed,
   however, that there is not the slightest indication in Plato that this
   idea of the world was conceived of as a personal agent, or as anything
   else than an attribute of the Divine mind, in which it resides like a
   plan in the mind of an architect. [905]

   2. The indebtedness of Philo to Plato is very obvious; but it is not
   from Plato that Philo derives the term Logos. He obtains this term from
   the Stoics. By the Logos, however, the Stoics as little as Plato
   understood a distinct hypostasis in the sphere of the Divine--a second
   Divine Being. The Logos, with the Stoics, is simply the Divine Reason
   itself--that eternal Divine Reason which is immanent in the universe,
   and in substance is one with it (fire). There was a further doctrine
   which the Stoics held, however, which is of great importance for the
   understanding of Philo. Together with their fundamentally pantheistic
   conception of the all-pervading Divine Reason, they held that this
   Reason develops or manifests itself in a multitude of powers or forces,
   called also Xeiyoe. This is the famous Stoical doctrine of the logoi
   spermatioi--the Logos-seeds or powers (dunameis) which develop
   themselves in particular things. The theory is very different from
   Plato's; yet the step was not great to identify these seed-like Chopsoi
   of the Stoics--the immanent rational principles of things--with the
   "ideas" of Plato, which also in their own way were active powers or
   principles. Here, then, we have another premiss of the theory of Philo.
   Philo takes over this doctrine of the Stoics bodily,--identifies their
   active iopsom with the "ideas" of Plato,--identifies them, further,
   with the Old Testament angels and Greek demons,--and gathers them up,
   finally, as the Stoics also did, into the unity of the one Logos.

   3. But Philo went a step further. It is the peculiarity of his theory
   that this Logos is distinguished from God Himself as the absolute and
   highest Being--is hypostatised--projected, as it were, from the Divine
   mind, and viewed, though in a very wavering and fluctuating way, as a
   personal agent. [906] Now, where did Philo get this last conception?
   Not from Platonic or Stoical philosophy-- not from Greek philosophy at
   all. He got it from the same source whence he derived his immovable
   Monotheism, his firm faith in Divine Providence, his doctrine of
   angels, etc.,--from the Old Testament. The Old Testament also has its
   distinction between God in His hidden and incommunicable essence and
   God as revealed; and has its names for this Revelation-side of God's
   nature (His name, glory, face, word, angel of Jehovah, etc. Cf.
   Oehler's Theol. of the Old Testament, pp. 181-196; Newman's Arians, pp.
   92, 153). There is, in particular, the doctrine of the (personified)
   Divine Wisdom in the Book of Proverbs. These germs did not lie without
   development on the soil of Judaism, as seen in the curious doctrine of
   the Memra, or word of Jehovah, in the Targums (cf. Edersheim's Jesus
   the Messiah, i. pp. 47, 48; ii. pp. 659-664--Appendix on "Philo of
   Alexandria and Rabbinic Theology")--the Memra being a distinct
   hypostasis whose name is substituted for Jehovah's; and that they were
   developed on Greek soil is evidenced by the apocryphal Book of Wisdom,
   in which we have, as Schurer points out, nearly all the elements of
   Philo's doctrine already present (Hist. of Jewish People, Div. ii. vol.
   iii. p. 232). We cannot err, therefore, in attributing Philo's doctrine
   of the hypostatic Logos to the same Old Testament source.

   Once this is granted, many things are clear. The predicates with which
   Philo clothes his Logos--those of Creator, High-Priest, Archangel,
   Intercessor, etc.--are plainly drawn over upon it from the Old
   Testament. But it is also clear how Philo's doctrine should become in a
   certain way a preparation for the gospel. Comparing his view with that
   of the Gospel of John, we see, indeed--notwithstanding assertions to
   the contrary--a fundamental contrast. The evangelist has his feet on a
   fact which line seeks to interpret; Philo moves throughout in the
   region of speculation. An incarnation would conflict with the first
   principles of his philosophy. The whole substance of the doctrine in
   the Fourth Gospel is different from Philo's speculations. Even in their
   respective conceptions of the Logos, John and Philo are at variance;
   for Philo means by Logos the internal Reason, never the spoken word;
   while John means the word uttered, spoken. His view is in accordance
   with the Palestinian, not with the Greek conception. I cannot therefore
   but agree with Harnack when he says: "John and Philo have little more
   in common than the name" (Dogmengeschichte, i. p. 85). Even the term
   Logos does not occur after the Prologue. But suppose the resemblances
   had been greater than they are, would this necessarily have been to the
   prejudice of the Gospel? I cannot see it; for it has just been shown
   that the one peculiar thing in Philo's theory,--that which brings it
   into relation with the Gospel,--viz. its hypostatisation of the Logos,
   is precisely that feature which he did not get from Greek philosophy,
   but from the Old Testament. It was a very different thing for one whose
   mind was stored, as Philo's was, with the facts of the Old Testament
   Revelation, to come in contact with the suggestive teachings of Plato,
   from what it would have been for another with no such preparation (cf.
   Newman's Arians, pp. 91, 92). Philo, working with these ideas, struck
   out a theory which is not unchristian, but goes forward rather to meet
   the Christian view, and find its completion in it. That there is a
   Divine Reason in the universe, and that this universal Logos is none
   other than He who is the life and light of men, and who in the fulness
   of time became flesh,--this is not less Christian teaching because
   Philo in some respects was in accord with it. John, if we assume him to
   have heard of this doctrine of Philo's, had no reason to reject it so
   far as it went. It harmonised with the truth he held, and furnished a
   fitting form in which to convey that truth. Whether even this much of
   Alexandrian influence is present in the Gospel, it is not easy to
   determine. Meanwhile, it is only doing justice to this great Jewish
   thinker to see in him an important link in the providential preparation
   for Christian conceptions--even if we do not go further, and speak of
   him, with Pfleiderer, as "the last Messianic prophet of Israel, the
   Alexandrian John the Baptist, who stretches out a hand to John the
   Evangelist" (Religionsphilosophie, iii. p. 176, Eng. trans.).

   On Philo's philosophy, and his relation to the Gospel, the works of
   Siegfried, Drummond, Zeller, Schurer, Edersheim, Harnack, Pfleiderer,
   Hatch (Hibbert Lectures), Martineau (Seat of Authority), Godet, Dorner,
   etc., may be consulted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [905] The "ideas," however are also regarded as the immanent forms or
   essences of things, which become what they are through "participation"
   in them,--a point of contact with the Stoical doctrine noted below.

   [906] It is a point on which opinions differ as to whether Philo's
   Logos was conceived of as a personal agent--was hypostatised (see
   Drummond's Philo of Alexandria, which upholds the negative); but the
   above seems the preferable view.

LECTURE 6 NOTE C.--P. 233.

  THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST AND THE REALITY OF HIS DIVINE CLAIM.

   If the premisses of the Christian view are correct as to Christ's claim
   to be the Son of God, and as to the connection of sin with death, it
   was impossible that He, the Holy One, should be holden of death. The
   Prince of Life must overcome death. His resurrection is the pledge that
   death shall yet be swallowed up in victory.

   On the other hand, the denial of Christ's resurrection leads to a
   subversion of His whole claim as unfounded. [907] If historically real,
   the resurrection of Christ is a confirmation of Christ's entire claim;
   if it did not happen, this alone negates it. The resurrection is thus
   an integral part of the Christian view. In this respect also--as well
   as in its bearings on our justification--we may say: "If Christ bath
   not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins" (1 Cor.
   xv. 17). [908] It is only what might have been anticipated, therefore,
   when we find the advocates of the modern view--those who refuse
   Christ's claim--emphatic in their denial of the resurrection, and
   unceasing in their efforts to demolish the evidence of it. It is more
   surprising to find writers who claim to be upholders of the true
   Christianity playing fast and loose with this fact of the Gospel, and
   doing their best to belittle the importance of it for Christian faith.
   I refer particularly to the attitude of certain writers of the
   Ritschlian school. It is extremely doubtful if leading representatives
   of this school, as Harnack and Wendt, accept the resurrection of Christ
   in the literal sense at all. Harnack expressly avers that there is no
   satisfactory historical evidence of the resurrection of Christ. He goes
   further, and pours contempt on the attempt to find such evidence. He
   not merely argues--what all will admit--that a faith in Christ based on
   mere historic evidence is no true faith; but he scouts the idea of
   being dependent on historic evidence at all. Such evidence, if we had
   it, would give us, he thinks, no help. Faith must be perfectly
   independent of evidence coming to us through the testimony of others."
   To believe on the ground of appearances which others have had, is a
   levity which will always revenge itself through uprising doubt." This
   is professedly an, exaltation of faith . hut it directly becomes
   apparent that faith is not intended to give us any guarantee of the
   physical resurrection--that, in truth, this part of Christianity is to
   be given up. The Christian "has nothing to do with a knowledge of the
   form in which Christ lives, but only with the conviction that He is the
   living Lord." The determination of the form was dependent on the widely
   differing general representations about a future life, resurrection,
   restoration, and glorification of the body, which prevailed at that
   particular time (see the whole note, Dogmengeschichte, i. pp. 75, 76).'
   Wendt speaks in quite similar terms. Christ's sayings on His own
   resurrection are interpreted as conveying only the idea that "Jesus
   would after the briefest delay be awakened from death to the heavenly
   life with God"; and the Church misinterpreted them in applying them on
   the ground of "appearances which were held by them as certain facts of
   experience to a literal bodily resurrection" (Die Lehre Jesu, ii. p.
   543). One would like to know how much objective reality Wendt is
   disposed to attribute to these "appearances." To Herrmann also the
   exaltation of Christ is "a thought of faith," indemonstrable through
   historical evidence. It is an ill service to name the resurrection to
   us living to-day as a fact likely to convince unbelievers. "For it is
   related to us by others" (Verkehr, 2nd edition, p. 239). [909]

   This minimising of the importance of the historical resurrection on the
   part of Ritschlian writers accords only too well with the general
   subjectivity of the school. A theory which resolves religion wholly
   into judgments of value," or, as Herrmann prefers to call them,
   "thoughts of faith," has clearly no room for an objective fact like the
   resurrection. A view which lays the whole stress on the impression
   (Eindruck) produced by Christ's earthly life, has no means of
   incorporating the resurrection into itself as a constitutive part of
   its Christianity. It remains at most a deduction of faith without inner
   relation to salvation. It is apt to be felt to be a superfluous
   appendage. It might almost be said to be a test of the adequacy of the
   view of Christ and His work taken by any school, whether it is able to
   take in the resurrection of Christ as a constitutive part of it. I
   cannot therefore but regard the Ritschlian position as virtually a
   surrender of faith in Christ's resurrection. The attempt to set faith
   and historical evidence in opposition to each other is one that must
   fail. Since it is implied in Christ's whole claim that death cannot
   hold Him, not merely, as with the Ritschlians, that He has a spiritual
   life with God, faith would be involved in insoluble contradictions if
   it could be shown that Christ has not risen; or, what comes to the same
   thing, that there is no historical evidence that He has risen. It may
   be, and is, involved in our faith that He is risen from the dead; but
   this faith would not of itself be a sufficient ground for asserting
   that He had risen, if all historical evidence for the statement were
   wanting. Faith cherishes the just expectation that, if Christ has
   risen, there will be historical evidence of the fact; and were such
   evidence not forthcoming, it would be driven back upon itself in
   questioning whether its confidence was not self-delusion. In harmony
   with this view is the place which the resurrection of Christ holds in
   Scripture, and the stress there laid upon its historical attestation (1
   Cor. xv. 1-19). I cannot enter here into detailed discussion of the
   historical evidence. The empty grave on the third day is a fact
   securely attested by the earliest traditions. The undoubting faith of
   the first disciples in the resurrection of their Lord, and in His
   repeated appearances to themselves, is also beyond question. Baur and
   most candid writers acknowledge that something extraordinary must have
   happened on that third day to hay a basis for this faith, and to change
   their despair into joyful and triumphant confidence (see Baur's Church
   History, i. p. 42, Eng. trans.). The hypothesis of imposture has now no
   respectable advocates. The idea of a "swoon" finds little support. The
   "vision hypothesis," which would reduce the apostles to the level of
   hysterical women, is inexplicable out of psychological conditions, and
   has been refuted almost to weariness (see good remarks on it in
   Beyschlag's Leben Jesu, in his chapter on the Resurrection, i. pp.
   406-450). The attempt to make it appear as if Paul believed only in a
   visionary appearance of Christ, can hardly convince anybody. In all
   these discussions the alternative invariably comes back to
   be--conscious imposture, or the reality of the fact. This is the
   simplest explanation of all of the narratives of the resurrection--that
   it really took place. As Beyschlag says: "The faith of the disciples in
   the resurrection of Jesus, which no one denies, cannot have originated,
   and cannot be explained otherwise than through the fact of the
   resurrection, through the fact in its full, objective, supernatural
   sense, as hitherto understood" (p. 440). So long as this is contested,
   the resurrection remains a problem which the failure of rival attempts
   at explanation only leaves in deeper darkness.

   For a good statement and criticism of the various hypotheses, see
   Schaff's Hist. of the Church, i. pp. 172-186; Godet's Defence of the
   Christian Faith (Eng. trans.), chaps. i. and ii. (against Reville); and
   Christlieb's Moderne Zweifel, Lect. VII. (Eng. trans.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [907] On the same principle that in a hypothetical syllogism the denial
   of the consequent leads to the denial of the antecedent. If Christ was
   the Divine Son, He could not be holden of death. If He was holden of
   death, His claim to be the Divine Son is refuted.

   [908] The resurrection has a constitutive place in the Christian view
   in connection with Redemption; but into this I do not enter here.

   [909] Bornemann seems to hold a literal resurrection, but regards it as
   insoluble whether Christ really appeared in the body to His disciples,
   "or whether those appearances rested on a miraculous working of the
   Person of Jesus on the souls of the disciples," i.e. were subjective
   impressions; and treats the question as indifferent to
   faith.--Unterricht, p. 85.

LECTURE 7 NOTE A.--P. 270.

  RECENT THEORIES OF THE TRINITY.

   Some examples may be given of recent theories of the Trinity which seem
   defective from the Christian point of view. Of these, three classes may
   be named:

   I. Speculative Theories, which do not start from the basis of Christian
   facts, but are the products of a priori deduction. These theories are
   abstract, speculative, cosmological, with little relation to
   distinctively Christian interests. The typical example here is Hegel's,
   in his Religionsphilosophie,. ii. pp. 223-251. Hegel speaks of an
   immanent Trinity in God--a Trinity of God's being before or outside of
   the creation of the world. He does not disdain even the name
   "persons,"--"person, or rather subject," speaks of Father, Son, and
   Spirit. Yet this Trinity is little more than the play of pure thought
   with itself in the element of highest abstraction: thought eternally
   distinguishing itself from itself, and as eternally sublating that
   distinction. The Father is the pure abstract idea; the Son is the
   element of particularity in that idea; the Spirit is the sublation of
   this in individuality. The distinction is only ideal, does not become
   real till the passage is made into the actuality of the finite world.
   Here Hegel is careful to remind us that, though in the domain of
   science the idea is first, in existence it is later--it comes later to
   consciousness and knowledge (p. 247). This Trinity has therefore no
   existence prior to the world or independently of it; it is simply
   potentiality and basis. [Hegel's own formula for his immanent process
   is--"God in His eternal universality is this: to distinguish Himself,
   to determine Himself, to posit another to Himself, and again to annul
   this distinction--therein to be in Him self, and only through this act
   of self-production is He Spirit" (p. 237).] The supreme abstraction of
   all this is very evident. The names of Christian theology are retained,
   with no agreement in content. What possible resemblance has "the idea
   in its abstract universality" to the Father in the Christian
   conception? Yet Hegel's treatment contains many profound and suggestive
   thoughts. In consonance with this speculative mode of thought are the
   theories which make the world, or the idea of the world, the mediating
   factor in the divine self-consciousness.

   II. Impersonal Theories, which recognise an immanent distinction in the
   Godhead, but one only of potencies, of momenta in the divine life, of
   modes of existence, therefore not a true personal Trinity. Thus
   Schelling (whose "potencies," however, become personal later in the
   world-process), [910] Rothe, Beyschlag, etc. This view lies near akin
   to Sabellianism. E.g., Rothe's distinctions of nature, essence, and
   personality have nothing to do with the Biblical distinctions of
   Father, Son, and Spirit, which he takes to relate only to the sphere of
   Revelation. A recent example of this type of theory is afforded by F.
   A. B. Nitzsch in his Lehrbuch der evangelischen Dogmatik (1892).
   Nitzsch holds that we are compelled to postulate, not simply a Trinity
   of Revelation, but a Trinity of essence (ii. p. 442). But it is a
   Trinity of potencies, principles, modes of subsistence (pp. 439-446),
   not persons. A Trinity of persons, he thinks, would be Tritheism (p.
   444). He grants that the Scripture teaches the personality of the
   Spirit, in part also of the Logos (pp. 440, 444). But this
   representation cannot be dogmatically used (p. 444). The personality of
   the Son lies in the human nature (p. 441), and the Spirit is not a
   person, but a principle. It is, however, a divine nature, in the strict
   sense of the word; is not to be interchanged with the holy disposition
   or religiously-elevated state of feeling of man, [911] but is
   considered as an objective, real divine power, which is essentially
   equal with God (p. 439). Nevertheless, when we go on to ask what this
   threefold mode of subsistence in the divine nature is, we find it
   difficult to distinguish it from a Trinity of Revelation. God as Father
   is God in Himself in distinction from His relation to the world; the
   Logos is the Revelation principle in God; and the Spirit is the
   principle of the divine self-communication (pp. 445, 446). Christ is
   the one in whom this Revelation finds its highest expression; in this
   sense He is the Incarnation of the Logos, and has "Godhead." "This
   expression," he tells us, "is quite in place" (p. 514). It is evident
   (l) that this so-called ontological Trinity is barely distinguishable
   from an economical or Sabellian one; (2) that Christ has not real
   Godhead--is, in truth, purely man, only the highest organ of divine
   Revelation; and (3) that the Trinitarian doctrine sought to be
   established is awkward and confused, and has little relation to the
   scriptural doctrine. It is made to rest primarily on God's relation to
   the world (p. 442), and not on the facts of Redemption. Its
   representation of " God in Himself" as the Father has nothing in common
   with the New Testament idea of Fatherhood. Then the personality is made
   to reside only in the first principle. God as Father is personal; the
   other two potencies (Logos and Spirit) are not personal Further, in
   this Trinity there is no room for the Son. The divine second principle
   is named "Logos," not "Son."--the Son comes into being with Jesus
   Christ. We have, therefore, the contradiction of an Eternal Father
   without an Eternal Son; the Logos is not the Son of the Trinitarian
   formula. The first and third members in this formula are truly
   divine--one personal, the other impersonal; the middle member is
   personal, but not truly divine. The ordinary doctrine of the Trinity
   may be difficult, but it certainly is more coherent and less
   contradictory than this of Nitzsch's, which seems to originate rather
   in a desire to keep in touch with ecclesiastical phraseology, than in
   any real need arising out of its author's Christology or Pneumatology.

   Dr. Dorner is a powerful defender of the Godhead of Christ, yet it is
   doubtful whether in his later views he has not surrendered the only
   basis on which this doctrine can be consistently maintained. In his
   History of the Doctrine of the Person of Christ, Dr. Dorner proceeds on
   the view (or seems to do so) of a Trinity of personal distinctions
   (Cf., e.g., his remarks on Hegel's theory in vol v. p. 150). In his
   System of Doctrine, on the other hand, he abandons this ground, and
   falls back on a Trinity of impersonal modes--momenta in the
   constitution of the one divine Personality. The Hypostases are to be
   thought of as "the eternal points of mediation of the Absolute divine
   Personality"--as "intermediate between attributes and Egoity and
   Personality" (i. pp. 382, 383, Eng. trans.); as "not of themselves and
   singly personal," but as having "a share in the one divine Personality
   in their own manner" (p. 448). As against a view which would make the
   divine Hypostases" three severed subjects, with separate
   self-consciousness, and divided self-determination," this has perhaps
   its truth. But Dr. Dorner evidently so regards these momenta of the
   divine Personality that neither is the Father a Person, nor the Son a
   Person, nor the Spirit a Person; but the three constitute together the
   One Personality, or divine self-consciousness. There is not such a
   distinction between Father and Son as could be expressed by the
   pronouns I and Thou. The strained character of this construction is
   seen in the attempt to retain the names Father and Son for these
   internal modes of the divine self-consciousness. It is not, it is to be
   observed, the completed Personality who is the Father, and the
   historical Christ who is the Son; but Father is the name for the first
   "point of mediation," Son for the second point, Spirit for the third,
   in the one self-consciousness. But how, it may be asked, can an
   impersonal moment in a process be described as Father, or how can an
   impersonal principle be described as Son?

   In accordance with this view, Dr. Dorner does not admit that a personal
   divine Being became incarnate in Christ, but only that a principle
   incorporated itself with the humanity derived from the virgin (iii. p.
   163). "God as Logos, as that special eternal mode of being of the
   deity, unites Himself perfectly and indissolubly with Jesus, and thus
   may be said to have become man in Him, because as Logos He has His
   being, His perfect Revelation in this man, and has become a living
   unity with this man" (iii. p. 303). Christ is not simply human or
   simply divine, but the divine and human natures coalesce to form a
   "God-human Ego" or personality (pp. 308, 309). Here, again, one cannot
   but feel that Dr. Dorner's theory leaves the divinity of Christ in an
   exceedingly ambiguous position. He is constantly objecting to the
   orthodox doctrine that it imperils the integrity of the humanity of
   Christ--i-makes it unlike ours. But what of his own theory of Christ's
   peculiarly constituted Personality? Either it must be held that this
   union of the Divine principle with His humanity is akin in character to
   that which takes p lace in every believer--in which case his ground is
   taken away for asserting a sole and exclusive divinity for Christ; or
   it ceases to be a truly human person (as, on the other hand, it is not
   a Divine Person), and can only be thought of as a tertium quid, a
   peculiar product of the union of divine and human factors. The Church
   doctrine at least avoids this ambiguity by saying boldly--it is a
   divine Person who appears in humanity,--one who submits Himself to the
   conditions of humanity, yet in origin and essence is eternal and
   divine. It is difficult to see how, on Dr. Dorner's view, Christ should
   he a truly divine being; but if He is so--and there can be no mistake
   about Dr. Dorner's earnestness of conviction on the subject--the
   conclusion cannot be avoided that as in the theories of Rothe and
   Beyschlag, a new divine Person has since the Incarnation been added to
   the Godhead. There was but one divine Personality before--not the
   Father, but the one God, constituted through the three" modes"; there
   is now a second, as the result of the Incarnation of one of these
   modes--true God and Man. Surely the mere statement of such a view is
   sufficient to show its untenableness.

   III. Neo-Sabellian Theories, which resolve the Trinity into aspects of
   the divine in the process of its self--manifestation or Revelation. The
   ground is abandoned of an immanent or ontological Trinity, and the
   names Father, Son, and Spirit are taken but as expressions for the
   phases of the divine self-manifestation m nature or grace.
   Schleiermacher inclines to this view (I. Der christ. Glaube, sects.
   170-172), and we have seen that theories like Rothe's and Nitzsch's
   tend to pass over into it. The Ritschlian theologians have no
   alternative but to adopt it. It is a view which will always have a
   certain popularity, seeming, as it does, to evade metaphysical
   subtleties, while giving a plausible, easily apprehended interpretation
   of the Trinitarian formula. Its simplicity, however, is all upon the
   surface. The moment it is touched with the finger of criticism, its
   inadequacy is revealed.

   The forms of these Neo-Sabellian theories are as varied as the minds
   that produce them. We may distinguish, first, certain popular forms.
   The old Sabellianism confined itself to the stadia of Revelation (the
   Father in the Law, the Son in the Incarnation, the Spirit in the
   Church). In modern times we have a wide variety of triads--God as
   Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier; God m creation (Father), in Christ
   (Son), in the inward fellowship of believers (Spirit); God in nature
   (Father), in history (Son), in conscience (Spirit); God in Himself
   (Father), as revealed (Son), as the principle of inward communion
   (Spirit), etc. A common feature in nearly all these triads is the
   identification of God as Creator with the Father; or again, God in His
   absolute, self-enclosed being, is viewed as the Father. But it cannot
   be too often repeated that it is not peculiarly as Creator that God, in
   the Christian view, is revealed as the Father. Creation is not the
   Revelation of God's Fatherhood. It is in Christ only that the
   Fatherhood of God is perfectly revealed (Matt. xi. 27). We know the
   Father thorough the Son. Still less does Fatherhood, in the Christian
   sense, denote God in the depths of His absoluteness. The truth in these
   views is that the Son is the principle of Revelation in the Godhead;
   that the Father, apart from the Son, is undisclosed and unrevealed. But
   that to which the Son heads us back in God is a true Fatherhood of
   knowledge, love, and will. The second criticism to be made on these
   theories is that they do not give us a truly divine Trinity of Father,
   Son, and Spirit. Whether the Son is identified with the "world," or
   with "humanity," or with "Christ," the second member of the Trinity is
   not divine as the first and third are. It is not God who is the Son,
   but the (non-divine) Son reveals God. This, it may be observed, is a
   principal distinction between the ancient and the modern Sabellianism.
   The old Sabellianism sought to hold by a real Godhead of Christ, though
   it failed in doing so. It was the same God, according to it, who in the
   old dispensation revealed Himself as Father, who afterwards became
   incarnate as Son, and who later was manifested as the Holy Spirit in
   the Church. The defects of this view were glaring; for if the phases
   were, as the Sabellians held, successive, then the one God ceased to be
   Father before He became Son, and had ceased to be Son before He became
   Spirit. Then Father and Son are terms without meaning. But, further, in
   ceasing to be Son, the divine must be supposed to have left the
   humanity of Christ. Thus the reality of the Incarnation is again
   denied. [912] We have only a temporary union of the Godhead with the
   man Christ Jesus. In the Neo-Sabellianisms, on the other hand, the
   Person of Christ is regarded as divine only in a figurative and
   improper way, i.e. as the bearer of a divine Revelation, or in an
   ethical sense; and the successive phases of the divine
   self-manifestation are not regarded as necessarily sublating each
   other; i.e. God remains Father, while revealed as Son, while manifested
   as Spirit.

   Kaftan's view of the Trinity in his Das Wesen der christ. Religion does
   not rise above a Trinity of Revelation or manifestation. "The Christian
   believes in God," he says, "the supra-terrestrial Lord of the world,
   who was from the beginning, and is in eternity. He believes in the
   Godhead of Jesus, the historical Founder of our religion, in whom God
   has revealed Himself, through whom God has entered into that relation
   to mankind which from eternity He had in view. He believes in a power
   of the divine Spirit in the history of mankind which, since the
   appearance of Jesus Christ, and more precisely since His resurrection
   from the dead, has come to its perfection in Christendom, and which
   transplants the man, who allows himself to be possessed by it, into the
   blessed fellowship of the divine life. But still it is one God in whom
   he believes. . . . How can this be otherwise brought to a single
   expression than by designating the Christian faith in God as the faith
   in a three-one God? The Christian has and knows God only through Christ
   in the Holy Spirit" (p. 388). "Understood in a Christian sense, God is
   personal Spirit; as such we find Him in the historical personal life of
   Jesus Christ; as such we believe in Him ruling in history: this is the
   signification of the Christian faith in the three-one God" (p. 390,
   first edition). This is a much higher position than the ordinary
   Ritschlian one [note the emphatic assertion of Christ's resurrection
   from the dead, and the connection of this with the mission of the
   Spirit]. The crucial point is the affirmation of Christ's divinity.
   Now, whatever this means to Kaftan, it is certain it does not mean the
   entrance into time of a pre-existing divine Being; nor would he allow
   the inference to a personal distinction in the Godhead as the ground of
   the Incarnation (p. 391). His Trinitarian doctrine, therefore, does not
   mean more than that God has a super-earthly mode of being, that He has
   revealed Himself historically in Jesus Christ, and that He has wrought
   since as a spiritual power in the hearts of men. He refuses, indeed, to
   admit that this is a mere economical Trinity. The Revelation, he says,
   expresses the essence. But Sabellianism never denied that there was
   that in God which determined the modes of His self-revelation, or that
   to this extent they expressed His nature. Kaftan's midway position is
   untenable. Either he must deal earnestly with the "Godhead" of Christ
   which he so strenuously maintains, and then he can hardly avoid moving
   back on personal distinctions; or, holding to his modal view of the
   Trinity, he will find it increasingly difficult to regard Christ as
   truly divine.

   [910] Pfleiderer remarks on Schelling's Trinity--"The interpretation of
   the three potencies by the three persons of the Church's doctrine of
   the Trinity, and the more than bold exposition of dogmatic formulae and
   passages of Scripture, we may pass as by a mere hors d'oeuvre without
   value for philosophy. Orthodoxy could feel no gratitude to our
   philosopher for his deduction of a triple Divine personality which only
   began with the creation, and was only to be fully realised at the
   conclusion of the world-process. The trinity arrived at is that of
   Montanism or Sabellianism, rather than that of the
   Church."--Religionsphilosophie, iii. p. 21 (Eng. trans.). A good
   criticism of Beyschlag's Trinitarian view may be seen in Dorner, Syst.
   of Doct. iii. pp. 258-260.

   [911] Pfleiderer explains the Holy Spirit rationalistically as "the
   arrival of the Divine reason at supremacy in our
   heart."--Religionsphilosophie, iii. p. 305.

   [912] Or reduced to a mere theophany. Ancient Sabellianism spoke of an
   absorption even of the humanity of Christ.

LECTURE 7 NOTE B.--P. 276.

  DR. MARTINEAU AS A TRINITARIAN.

   Dr. advocating Trinitarianism is a veritable Saul among the prophets.
   Yet this is the drift of his striking essay (first published as late as
   1886) on "A Way Out of the Trinitarian controversy." The object of the
   essay is to find a way of reconciling the differences of Unitarians and
   Trinitarians, which Dr. Martineau thinks might be accomplished if
   parties only came better to understand each other. He says, with great
   truth, "Religious doctrine may be only theory to the critic, but it is
   the expression of fact to the believer--fact infinite and ever present,
   the vital breath of every moment, deprived of which the soul must gasp
   and die. . . . It is from the depth of such natures that theology and
   churches arise; and if you would harmonise them when they seem
   discordant, you must descend into the depths; you must feel their truth
   ere you criticise their errors, and appreciate their difference before
   you can persuade them that they are one. . . . To feel charity towards
   a sin, you must understand the temptation; towards a sorrow, you must
   know its depths; towards an erring creed, you must appreciate its
   meaning and its ground" (Essay ii. pp. 626, 627). In this spirit he
   aims at setting forth what he conceives to be the truth about the
   Trinity.

   The intention is excellent, but the success of the attempt must be
   pronounced doubtful. It is, however, exceedingly interesting as coming
   from Dr. Martineau. For his thought leads him to recognise a certain
   real Trinitarian distinction in God; and, so far as one can judge, he
   does not object even to Trinitarians speaking of these distinctions as
   in a sense personal. The gist of his view is expressed in the following
   passages: "God then, as He exists in Himself ere Heat all appears,--God
   alone with the void,--God as a still presence,--a starless night, a
   dumb immensity of intellect, is intended by the First Person in the
   received creed. Let now the silence be broken, let the thought burst
   into expression, fling out the poem of creation, evolving its idea in
   the drama of history, and reflecting its own image in the son of man;
   then this manifested phase of the; divine existence is the Son. . . .
   The one fundamental idea by which the two personalities are meant to be
   distinguished is simply this--that the first is God in His primeval
   essence,--infinite meaning without finite indications; the second is
   God speaking out in phenomena and fact, and leaving His sign whenever
   anything comes up from the deep of things, or merges back again. . . .
   Respecting the Third Person in the Trinity, and the doctrine of the
   Holy Spirit, . . . the separation of His personality from the others,
   as not proper to be merged in them, is founded on a feeling deep and
   true, viz., that the human spirit is not a mere part of nature. . . .
   We are persuaded of something diviner within us than this--akin in.
   freedom, in power, in love, to the supreme Mind Himself. I virtue of
   this prerogative, we have to be otherwise provided for, in our highest
   life, than the mere products of creative order; we need not control,
   simply to be imposed and obeyed, but living communion like with like,
   spirit with spirit. To open this communion, to bring this help and
   sympathy, to breathe on the fading consciousness of our heavenly
   affinity, and make us one with the Father an the Son, is the function,
   truly of a quite special kind, reserved in the doctrine of the Church
   for the Holy Ghost. What God is in Himself; what He is as manifested in
   the universe and history, thought to a focus in the drama of
   Redemption; what He is in communion with our inner spirit,--these are
   the three points of view denoted by the Persons' of the Trinity" (pp.
   332, 334, 336). The "Eternal Sonship" he connects with the doctrine of
   eternal creation The most paradoxical part of the essay is where he
   seeks to prove that the Unitarians, while imagining they were
   worshipping the "Father," have all the while been worshipping the
   "Son"--that the Father "is really absent from the Unitarian Creed" p.
   536). After the remarks in last note, it is not necessary to say much
   in criticism of this theory. It is, after all, only a modal theory--the
   substituting of "phases" and "points of view" for the orthodox
   "Persons." The distinction of "Father" and "Son" is that of the hidden
   and the revealed God; and the "Son" has His raison d'etre in the
   existence of a world. There is no room for a special Incarnation. The
   "Son" is manifested in Jesus not otherwise than He is manifested in all
   history--only in higher (or highest) degree. But it has already been
   pointed out that this identification of the "Father" with God in
   Himself, "dormant potency," "still presence," "dumb immensity of
   intellect," has no resemblance to the Christian idea of the Father. Dr.
   Martineau goes here on an altogether wrong track. His theory does not
   express the Christian facts.

LECTURE 8 NOTE A.--P. 299.

  THE GERM THEORY OF JUSTIFICATION.

   This subtle theory of justification, according to which the manifoldly
   imperfect believer is accepted on the ground of his germinal
   holiness--"for in the first moment," as Schleiermacher says, "the whole
   development is implicitly given" (p. 105),--is not without many
   advocates. Its phraseology is found in some who are far from wishing to
   remove the ground of acceptance from the doing and suffering of Christ;
   and it finds favour with others who reject this objective ground, and
   need another explanation.

   Dr. M'Leod Campbell finds this view in Luther, whose doctrine he
   expounds thus--"secondly, because this excellent condition of faith is
   in us but a germ--a grain of mustard-seed--a feeble dawn, God, in
   imputing it as righteousness, has respect unto that of which it is the
   dawn--of which, as the beginning of the life of Christ in us, it is the
   promise, and in which it shall issue" (Nat. of Atonement, p. 34 (4th
   ed.)). There is no doubt that some of Luther's expressions in the
   Commentary on Galatians give colour to this statement. E.g. "Wherefore
   Christ apprehended by faith, and dwelling in the heart, is the true
   Christian righteousness, for the which God counteth us righteous, and
   giveth us eternal life" (on ii. 16). "We conclude, therefore, upon
   these words, It was imputed to him f or righteousness,' that
   righteousness indeed beginneth through faith, and by the same we have
   the first-fruits of the Spirit; but because faith is weak, it is not
   made perfect without God's imputation. Wherefore faith beginneth
   righteousness, but imputation maketh it perfect unto the day of Christ.
   . . . For these two things work Christian righteousness: faith in the
   heart, which is a gift of God, and assuredly believeth in Christ; and
   also that God accepteth this imperfect faith for perfect righteousness,
   for Christ's sake, in whom I have begun to believe" (on iii. 6). No one
   can doubt, however, taking the general drift of the Commentary, that in
   Luther's view the sole objective ground of the sinner's pardon and
   acceptance is the cross and righteousness of Christ.

   In a similar way Martensen expresses himself--"For faith is like the
   grain of mustard-seed, a small, insignificant but fructifying seed corn
   which contains within it the fulness of a whole future. In His gracious
   contemplation God beholds in the seed corn the future fruit of
   blessedness; in the pure will, the realised ideal of freedom"
   (Dogmatics, p. 392). Yet Martensen is emphatic in declaring--"The
   evangelical Church teaches that Christ alone, received by faith, is the
   Righteousness of man; and thus she leads man back from what is
   imperfect and multifarious to ONE who is Himself perfection; she brings
   him back from his wanderings in the desert to the pure Fountain where
   freedom springs from grace; to the holy centre where God looks upon
   man, not in the light of the temporal and finite, but in the light of
   Christ's eternity and perfection" (p. 393).

   There is no question of the truth of the view in itself that, as
   Martensen further says," Justifying faith cannot possibly exist in the
   soul in a dead or merely stationary condition, but that, like the
   living, fruit-bearing seed corn, it contains within itself a mighty
   germinating power, which must necessarily beget a holy development of
   life" (p. 393), and that God sees in this germinal holiness all that is
   to proceed from it, and even, if we please, imputes to the believer
   anticipatively the yet future result. But confusion is introduced if we
   confound or exchange this with the sinner's justification. The
   imputation in question is not in order to acceptance, but is a mode of
   contemplating the fruition of holiness in persons already accepted. It
   is an act of the divine complacency in and towards believers already
   justified and adopted on the sole and all-sufficient ground of Christ's
   work done on their behalf.

   This view, translated into their own peculiar phraseology, is naturally
   the one adopted by idealistic writers who treat of religion. Kant led
   the way here when, in rationalising the doctrine of justification, he
   represented it as meaning that, for the sake of our faith in the moral
   good, we are already held to be what, while on earth, and perhaps in
   any future world, we are no more than about to become (Religion
   innerhalb der Grenzen der bloss. Vernunft, Bk. II. sec. 3). I quote two
   illustrative passages from Mr. Bradley and Mr. T. H. Green.

   "Justification by faith means," says Mr. Bradley, "that, having thus
   identified myself with the object, I feel myself in that identification
   to be already one with it, and to enjoy the bliss of being, all
   falsehood overcome; what I truly am.- By my claim to be one with the
   ideal, which comprehends me too, and by assertion of the non-reality of
   all that is opposed to it, the evil in the world and the evil incarnate
   in me through past bad acts, all this falls into the unreal; I being
   one with the ideal, this is not mine, and so imputation of offences
   goes with the change of self, and applies not now to my true self, but
   to the unreal, which I repudiate and hand over to destruction. . . .
   Because the ideal is not realised completely and truly as the ideal,
   therefore I am not justified by the works, which issue from faith, as
   works; since they remain imperfect. I am justified solely and entirely
   by the ideal identification; the existence of which in me is on the
   other hand indicated and guaranteed by works, and iii its very essence
   implies them--Ethical Studies pp. 293,294.

   Mr. Green says: "We most nearly approach the Pauline notion of imputed
   righteousness when we say that it is a righteousness communicated in
   principle, but not yet developed in act."--Paper on Justification by
   Faith, in Works, iii. p. 202.

   In the former of these extracts (as also in Mr. Green's own view) we
   are away from the historical Christ altogether, and have to deal only
   with "ideals," in relation to which we pass an act of judgment on
   ourselves in accordance with the metaphysical truth of things, and
   there is neither room nor need for a special justifying act of God.

LECTURE 9 NOTE A.--P. 325.

  RENAN'S ESCHATOLOGY.

   Hartmann's theory of cosmic suicide by the concurrent decision or the
   race is bizarre enough, but it is outdone by the extraordinary
   eschatology sketched by M. Renan in his Dialogues et Fragments
   Philosophiques, which, apparently, though he heads the section
   "Dreams," it is not his intention that we should take otherwise than
   seriously. It is a curious further illustration of how every. theorist
   feels the need of some kind of eschatology, as well as of the lengths
   to which credulity will go in minds that deem themselves too wise to
   accept Revelation. In Renan's view, the great business in which the
   universe is engaged is that of organising God. [913] God as yet only
   exists in ideal; the time will come when He will be materially realised
   in a consciousness analogous to that of humanity, only infinitely
   superior (p. 78) The universe will culminate in a single conscious
   centre, in which the conception of personal Monotheism will become a
   truth. An omniscient, omnipotent being will be the last term of the
   God-making evolution (l'evolution deifique); the universe will be
   consummated in a single organised being--the resultant of milliards of
   beings whose lives are summed up in his--the harmony, the sum-total of
   the universe (pp. . 125, 126). The climax of absurdity is reached in
   the notion the personal deity thus realised proceeds, now that he has
   come into existence, to raise the dead and hold a general judgment! M.
   Renan may be allowed here to speak for himself--"Yes, I conceive the
   possibility of the resurrection, and often say to myself with Job,
   Reposita est haec spes in sinu meo. If ever at the end of the
   successive evolutions the universe is led back to a single, absolute
   being, this being will be the complete life of all; he will renew in
   himself the life of beings who have vanished, or, if you will, in his
   will revive all those who have ever been.--When God shall be at once
   perfect and all-powerful, that is to say, when scientific omnipotence
   shall be concentrated in the hands of a good and just being, this being
   will wish to resuscitate the past in order to repair its innumerable
   injustices. God will exist more and more; the more he exists, the more
   just he will be.--He will attain to this fully on the day when whoever
   has wrought for the divine work shall feel that the divine work is
   finished, and shall see the part he has had in it. Then the eternal
   inequality of beings shall be sealed for ever," etc. (pp. 435, 436).
   Comment on such "dreams" is needless. Yet the spinning of such theories
   by a cultured intellect which has parted with its faith is not without
   its lessons.

LECTURE 9 NOTE B.--P. 327.

  THE GOSPEL AND THE VASTNESS OF CREATION.

   An interesting article on the subject treated of in the Lecture is
   contributed to the Contemporary Review for April 1889 by the late Prof.
   Freeman, under the title--"Christianity and the Geocentric' System."
   The article is full of suggestive and acute remarks. Prof. Freeman
   states the objection in its full strength. "It is unreasonable, it is
   urged, to believe that such a scheme as that of Christianity, implying
   such awful mysteries and so tremendous a sacrifice can have been
   devised for the sole benefit of such an insignificant part of the
   universe as the earth and its inhabitants" (p. 541). He does not,
   however, think there is much in it. "If it is meant," he says, "not
   merely as a rhetorical point, but as a serious objection, it really
   comes to this: we cannot believe that so much has been done for this
   earth as Christianity teaches, because this earth is so little; if this
   earth were only bigger, then we might believe it. . . . Surely nobody
   ever believed or disbelieved on this kind of ground. An objection of
   this kind is a rhetorical point, and nothing more" (p. 542). As a
   rhetorical .point nevertheless, he grants that it is telling, and
   proceeds to deal with it for what it is worth. He points out, first,
   how little the change from the "geocentric" view has done to alter the
   general tenor of our thoughts and feelings. It is not the case that the
   "geocentric" view led man to take an exaggerated view of his own
   importance. On the contrary, the sight of the starry heavens, even when
   hooked at with "geocentric" eyes, has always been to make one feel his
   littleness (Ps. viii.). "The truth is that the objection attributes to
   scientific theories a great deal more practical influence than really
   belongs to them. Whether the earth goes round the sun, or the sun goes
   round the earth, does not make the least practical difference to our
   general feelings, to our general way of looking at things. . . . We are
   all heliocentric' when we stop to think about it, . . . but I suspect
   most of us are geocentric' in practice. That is, we not only talk as if
   the sun really rose and set, but for all practical purposes we really
   think so. . . . Nobody really accepts or rejects the Christian religion
   or any other religion, merely through thinking whether the sun is so
   many thousands or millions of times bigger than the earth, or whether
   it is only the size of a cart-wheel, or at the outside, about the
   bigness of Peloponnesus" (p. 544) Next, he touches the question whether
   we have any reason to suppose that other worlds are inhabited. "
   Astronomers do not even attempt to tell us for certain whether even the
   other members of our own system are inhabited or not. . . . I believe I
   am right in saying that they tell us that Mars is the only planet of
   our system where men like ourselves could live; that, if the
   other--planets are inhabited, it must be by beings of a very different
   nature from ours" (p. 545). But the peculiar part of his argument,
   developed with great ingenuity and force, is a working out of the idea
   that it is, after all, quite in accordance with analogy that our world
   should he a very small one, and yet should play a most important part
   in the universe. Here the analogies of his own science of history
   furnish him with abundant illustration. "If it should be true that our
   earth does hold a kind of moral place in the universe out of all
   proportion to its physical size, the fact will be one of exactly the
   same kind as the fact that so small a continent as Europe was chosen to
   play the foremost part in the world's history, and that so small a part
   of Europe as Greece was chosen to play the foremost part in Europe" (p.
   558). Incidentally, in developing this argument, he refers to the fact
   noted in the Lecture, that the past history of our own world takes away
   in large part the force of the argument from the vast empty spaces of
   creation. "Here both the certain facts of geology and the less certain
   doctrine of evolution, instead of standing in the way of the argument,
   give it no small help. . . . We know that our own world remained in
   this seemingly useless and empty state for untold ages; there is
   therefore at least no absurdity in supposing that other worlds, some or
   all of them, are in the same state still. . . . The past emptiness and
   uselessness of the whole planet, the abiding emptiness and seeming
   uselessness of large parts of it, certainly go a long way to get rid of
   all a priori objection to the possible emptiness and seeming
   uselessness of some or all of the other bodies that make up the
   universe " (p. 548).

   A lengthy and valuable note on the subject will likewise he found in
   Dorner's History of the Doctrine of the Person of Christ, vol. v. pp.
   265-270. Dorner reviews, with his usual thoroughness and learning, the
   opinions held by others, but finds nothing to shake his confidence in
   the Christian view. "Concerning our planet, as thousand others we
   compared with a, must say that it is the Bethlehem amongst the rest,
   the least city amongst the thousands Judah, out of which the Lord was
   destined to proceed " (p. 267). He reminds us that Steffens and Hegel,
   like Whewell, "regard our planetary system as the most organised spot
   of the universe; the earth, this concentrated spot on which the Lord
   appeared, as its absolute centre, which both Hegel and Becker designate
   the Bethlehem of worlds" (p. 269).

   Ebrard likewise discusses the objection in his Christian Apologetics,
   i. p. 253 (Eng. trans.). Fiske, in his little book on Man's Destiny, is
   another who refers to it. Chap. i. is headed "Man's Place in Nature, as
   affected by the Copernican Theory." He concludes--"The speculative
   necessity for man's occupying the largest and most central spot in the
   universe is no longer felt. It is recognised as a primitive and
   childish notion. With our larger knowledge we see that these vast and
   fiery suns are after all but the Titan-like servants of the little
   planets which they bear with them in their flight through the abysses
   of space. . . . He who thus looks a little deeper into the secrets of
   nature than his forefathers of the sixteenth century, may well smile at
   the quaint conceit that man cannot be the object of God's care unless
   he occupies an immovable position in the centre of the stellar
   universe" (pp. 16, 17).

   Among the Ritschlians, the question is touched on by Ritschl, Recht.
   und Ver. iii. p. 580; and by Kaftan, Wahrheit, pp. 562, 563 (Eng.
   trans. ii. pp. 399-401).

   Finally, I may refer to the beautiful treatment of the higher and more
   spiritual aspects of the subject by Dr. John Ker in his sermon on "The
   Gospel and the Magnitude of Creation" (Sermons, p. 227).

LECTURE 9 NOTE C.--P. 341.

  ALLEGED PAULINE UNIVERSALISM.

   The two strongest passages in favour of Pauline universalism are
   undoubtedly 1 Cor. xv. 21-28 and Eph. i. 10, yet the ablest exegetes
   concur that in neither can Paul be held to teach the doctrine of
   universal salvation. With this view I cannot but agree. It is easy to
   read such a meaning into certain of Paul's universalistic expressions,
   but an unbiassed study of the passages and their context makes it plain
   that it is far from the apostle's intention to affirm any such
   doctrine. As respects 1 Cor. xv. 21-28, we have first the
   statement--"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
   alive" (ver. 22). But to affirm that in Christ all shall be made alive
   is a very different thing from affirming that all shall be made alive
   in Christ. And that the latter is not the apostle's thought is made
   evident from the next verse, which declares that this making alive of
   those that are Christ's takes place at His coming. "Each in his own
   order: Christ the first-fruits; then they that are Christ's, at His
   coming" (var. 23). This making alive, therefore, is the making alive at
   the resurrection at the Parousia. But no universalist maintains that at
   that period "they that are Christ's" embraces all humanity. The
   subsequent clauses are not more decisive. "The last enemy that shall be
   abolished is death" (ver. 27); but here again it is foreign to the
   context to suppose that Paul has in view any other abolition of death
   than that he has been speaking of throughout the chapter, viz. its
   abolition at the resurrection. The putting down of all (rival) rule,
   authority, and power (ver. 24), the putting all His enemies under His
   feet (ver. 25), the subjection of all things to the Son (vers. 27, 28),
   do not naturally suggest reconciliation or conversion, but rather
   forcible subjugation--the destruction of all hostile authority and
   influence. In this sense, accordingly, must be interpreted the final
   expression--the strongest of all--"that God may be all in all." Meyer
   observes--"Olshausen and de Wette find here the doctrine of restoration
   favoured also by Neander, so that en pasi would apply to all creatures,
   in whom God shall be the all-determining One. . . . The fact was
   overlooked that en pasi refers to the members of the kingdom hitherto
   ruled over by Christ, to whom the condemned, who, on the contrary, are
   outside of this kingdom, do not belong, and that the continuance of the
   condemnation is not done away even with the subjugation of Satan,
   since, on the contrary, the latter himself by his subjugation falls
   under condemnation" (Com. in loc.). Weiss similarly says: "Even the
   context of this passage excludes any referring of it to a restitution
   of all things (Apokatastasis), for the dominion which God henceforward
   wields immediately can be no other than that which Christ has received
   and given up to Him; and that does not consist in this, that all
   hostile powers are destroyed or converted, but in this, that they have
   become powerless, and are subject to His will."--Biblical Theol. ii. p.
   73 (Eng. trans.).

   The second passage, again, Eph. i. 10, speaks of a summing up of all
   things in Christ as head (I agree with Weiss that there is no need for
   weakening or denying the force of the composite word) in the
   dispensation of the fulness of the times--a truly wonderful and
   comprehensive expression. The ta panta here is in itself quite
   general,--all created things and beings,--and might therefore quite
   well suit a universalistic sense. But, first, the ta panta is limited
   by the succeeding clause,--"the things in the heavens, and the things
   on the earth,"--which excludes the demoniacal powers, certainly not
   conceived of as "things in the heavens"; and, next, it is a question
   whether time annulling of the divided state of "things on earth" is
   effected by the conversion of hostile powers, or not rather by their
   subjugation, and separation from the holy part of the creation. This is
   a question to be determined by Paul's general mode of thought, and
   Meyer and Weiss agree that such an idea as the final conversion of the
   unbelieving and the demons is not within his view. "With the Parousia,"
   says Meyer, "there sets in the full realisation which is the
   apokatastasis panton, (Matt. xix. 28; Acts iii. 21; 2 Pet. iii. 10
   ff.); when all antichristian natures and powers shall be discarded out
   of heaven and earth, so that thereafter nothing in heaven or upon earth
   shall be excluded from this gathering together again. . . . The
   restoration in the case of the devils, as an impossibility in the case
   of spirits radically opposed to God, is not in the whole New Testament
   so much as thought of. The prince of this world is only judged" (Com.
   in loc., and Remark 2, on the doctrine of Restoration)." A bringing
   back of the world of spirits hostile to God," says Weiss,--"which,
   moreover, is considered as definitely bad,--is as far away from the
   Biblical view as is also a need of Redemption on the part of the angel
   world, and therefore the author felt no need to guard his expressions
   against either of these thoughts. . . . Enough that they by their
   subjection to Christ are stripped of any power which can hurt the
   absolute dominion of Christ " (Biblical Theol. of N. T. ii. pp. 107,
   109).

   The one thing which would be really decisive in favour of a
   universalistic interpretation, would be some passage from Paul (or any
   part of the New Testament), which explicitly affirmed that fallen
   spirits or lost men in eternity would ultimately repent and be saved;
   but no such expression can be found. Dr. Cox has no scruple in telling
   us that those condemned in the judgment will yet, after a remedial
   discipline, all be brought to repentance, to faith; will be restored to
   God's Fatherly love, etc. If this is the Scripture doctrine, why do
   Christ and His apostles never explicitly say so? Why do they not use
   expressions as clear and unmistakable as Dr. Cox's own? Why only these
   general expressions, of which the application is the very question in
   dispute? The ancient prophets, e.g., had no difficulty in making clear
   their belief that a day of general conversion would come for sinful and
   rejected Israel. Why does Jesus, or Paul, or John not tell us as
   plainly that a day of general forgiveness and restoration will come for
   all God's backsliding children--that those whom they describe as
   perishing and destroyed, and under wrath, and undergoing the second
   death, will yet be changed in their dispositions, and made sharers of
   God's eternal life? It is not simply that this is not declared of all,
   but it is not, in one single utterance, declared of any; and while this
   is the state of the case scripturally, universal restoration, however
   congenial to our wishes, must be held to be a dream in the air, without
   solid basis in Revelation.

   What many passages do teach is the complete subjugation of those found
   finally opposed to Christ; and in this way the restoration of a unity
   or harmony in the universe, which involves the cessation of active, or
   at least effective, opposition to Christ's rule. What may be covered by
   such expressions,--or what yet unrevealed may in future ages be
   disclosed--who can tell?

   Reference may be made to a careful study of the whole New Testament
   teaching on this subject in a series of papers by the Rev. Dr. Agar
   Beet in the Expositor, vol. i. (4th series), 1890.
