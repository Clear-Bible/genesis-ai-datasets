PREFACE

   In an earlier volume, I recited the history of the Disciples of Christ
   under the title, Religion Follows the Frontier. The phrase was designed
   to emphasize the fact that this religious movement was born under
   pioneer conditions on the American frontier, in the days when the
   frontier was just crossing the Alleghenies, that much of its formative
   thinking followed patterns congenial to the frontier mind, and that its
   early expansion kept pace with the westward wave of migration.

   Since that book is now out of print, while interest in the theme is
   increasing, it has seemed desirable to rewrite the history. If this
   were merely a sequel to the other, I would call it Growing Up with the
   Country.

   It remains true that the pioneer beginnings must be remembered and
   understood if the initial motives and methods of the Disciples and the
   processes of their growth are to be understood. But important as the
   frontier is, as a fact in the history of the United States and of every
   phase of culture in the Middle West, an equally significant fact is
   that, as the frontier rolled westward, it left behind it a widening
   area in which pioneer conditions no longer prevailed. As the country
   was growing by the expansive drive of which the frontier was the
   cutting edge, it was also growing up, both behind and on the frontier.
   The process of maturing is as significant as that of expanding.

   Since the present purpose is to survey the history of the Disciples
   through both of these phases, I have resisted the allurement of this
   second title and am giving the book a name which includes both; for the
   movement is distinctively American, and every American movement which
   began in pioneer days and has lived through the cycles of American life
   until now has both followed the frontier and grown up with the country.

   As to the future--I am only a historian, not a prophet. But I shall be
   disappointed if this record of the past does not leave with the reader
   an acquaintance with the essential data upon which, using his own
   judgment and imagination, he will be disposed to project the curve of a
   future development far beyond any present attainments in promoting the
   ends for which the Disciples of Christ came into existence--the unity
   and purity of the Church, a reasonable and practical religion, and the
   enrichment of life through fellowship in the grace of our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

CHAPTER I
PRELUDE

   Who are these "Disciples of Christ"? What are these "Christian
   Churches" or "Churches of Christ" which now constitute one of the major
   religious groups in the United States? When, where, and how did they
   begin, and how have they become what they are?

   They began early in the nineteenth century with the union of two
   separate movements, one of which had close kinship with two others. All
   four were alike in aiming to simplify the complexities of Christian
   faith and in going back of the creeds and the traditional practices of
   existing churches to the plain teaching of the New Testament. They
   believed that this was easy to understand, and that the divisions of
   Christendom would disappear if Christians would only agree to speak as
   the apostles spoke and to do as they did. They believed that man was
   sinful and needed God's salvation; but they did not believe him to be
   so depraved by "original sin" that he could not, by the act of his own
   intelligence and by his own free will, accept the means of grace that
   have been provided. They wanted all the churches to unite on the basis
   of the simple and clear requirements of discipleship as given in the
   New Testament, leaving all doubtful and inferential matters in the
   field of "opinion," in which every Christian should exercise liberty,
   and scrap the machinery of synods and bishops, for which they found no
   warrant in Scripture.

   Of the two main movements, the name of Barton W. Stone was most
   prominent in one; the names of Thomas and Alexander Campbell in the
   other. Stone's movement (1804) began earlier than that of the Campbells
   (1809), but later than two others practically identical with it. But
   the Campbells' was the more dynamic, especially after it gained the
   advocacy of Walter Scott, who set the pattern for its evangelism. These
   are the four great names in the early history of the Disciples--Stone,
   Thomas Campbell, Alexander Campbell, and Scott. All four had been
   Presbyterians.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A Preview

   Stone was a native American of old colonial stock, born in Maryland,
   educated in North Carolina after spending most of his boyhood in
   Virginia. He did his most important work in Kentucky. Thomas and
   Alexander Campbell, father and son, were born in North Ireland, were
   educated at Glasgow University, and came to America only a short time
   before the launching of their reformatory movement. The influences seen
   in their work are those of a British background and an American
   environment. The center of their activity was the southwest corner of
   Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and the narrow strip of Virginia (now West
   Virginia) that lies between them. Walter Scott, born in Scotland and
   educated in the University of Edinburgh, came to America as a young man
   and was a teacher in Pittsburgh when he received the impulse which led
   him into the Campbell movement while it was still in its initial stage.

   Soon the followers of the Campbells, most of whom had recently been
   Baptists, and the associates of Stone, many of whom had been
   Presbyterians, discovered the identity of their programs, and the two
   movements flowed together into one. Stone's "Christians," chiefly in
   Kentucky and Tennessee, plus the Baptists who had joined Campbell's
   "Reformers" and were beginning to call themselves "Disciples," plus the
   hundreds of converts who had already responded to the
   faith-repentance-and-baptism evangelism of Scott and the others who had
   learned to preach as he did, added up to twenty or thirty thousand by
   the time of this union in 1832. From that point, growth was rapid, by
   persistent and persuasive preaching, by propaganda in print, and by the
   constant movement of population to new frontiers farther and farther
   west carrying with it the nuclei of new churches in the new
   settlements.

   This was at first a popular movement, unorganized and uncontrolled,
   with no high command, no common treasury, no general machinery for
   either promotion or direction. But the increasing magnitude of the
   enterprise, the changing social conditions as the Middle West grew out
   of its frontier stage, and the realization that such a religious body
   as this was coming to be had some responsibilities other than
   propagating itself--all these things made organization inevitable. Then
   followed colleges, missionary societies, conventions, and the other
   apparatus of an organic fellowship. But still, and always, there was
   fierce resistance to anything that seemed to threaten encroachment upon
   the liberty of the Christian individual or of the local congregation.
   Cooperation must always be voluntary.

   So the Disciples of Christ have become "a great people." It is to their
   credit that there has always been some confusion about their name.
   Aiming to promote union, they wanted a scriptural name that all
   Christians might use. They found in the New Testament certain terms
   applied to the undivided church or to its members. Alexander Campbell
   liked the name "Disciples." Stone preferred "Christians." A local
   church is commonly called a "Christian Church," or a "Church of
   Christ"; less frequently a "Church of Disciples of Christ." The name
   "Churches of Christ" (in the plural), as the designation for a group,
   generally refers to the conservative or antimissionary-society churches
   which became completely separated from the main body in 1906.

   But, though it is well to have unsectarian names which any Christian or
   any Christian church can use, it is highly convenient to have some
   designation which others do not generally use, so that the public will
   know what is meant when reference is made to the churches or members of
   this movement. Its objective may be the unity of all Christ's
   followers, but meanwhile it is a specific group, if not a denomination
   then a "brotherhood"--and a brotherhood is just as distinct an entity
   as a denomination. So, as a term that will be generally understood to
   mean us, the term "Disciples of Christ" has come into common use.

  Three Sources, Two Streams

   Looking back from a later time to describe the reformatory movement as
   it had been in the 1820's, Walter Scott wrote that there were then
   "three parties struggling to restore original Christianity."

   The first of these was the independent "Churches of Christ," which
   stemmed from the work of Glas, Sandeman, the Haldane brothers, and
   similar eighteenth century British restorers of primitive Christianity.
   Scott himself for a time belonged to one of these churches in
   Pittsburgh. They were few in number, had little relation to each other,
   little concern for union, and no evangelistic drive. This party is
   important for our purpose because it is one of the sources from which
   the Campbells derived suggestions for a rational conception of faith
   and the idea of "restoration" in its more legalistic and literalistic
   aspects. It will be described more particularly in the latter part of
   [12]Chapter II.

   The second was the "Christian" churches, existing in three independent
   groups in Virginia and North Carolina, in New England, New York, and
   Pennsylvania, and in Kentucky and adjacent states. The last of these
   divisions is doubtless the one Scott had chiefly in mind, and it is the
   one most closely related to our theme. Some account of these three
   bodies of "Christians" will be given in [13]Chapter IV.

   The third, said Scott, "originating with the writings and labors of
   Bro. A. Campbell," was at that time "chiefly in the bosom of the
   Regular Baptist churches." Chapters [14]V and [15]VI will tell the
   story of these "Reformers" down to the time of their separation from
   the Baptists.

   The first of these is significant as an influence and as part of the
   historical background. It contributed to the united movement few
   churches, few men, and no literature; but two of the men who came to
   the Disciples through this channel were invaluable--Walter Scott and
   Isaac Errett. The other two parties became substantial bodies, and they
   are the two main streams whose confluence produced the Disciples of
   Christ.

CHAPTER II
IDEAS WITH A HISTORY: UNION AND RESTORATION

   The union of all Christians and the restoration of primitive
   Christianity were the two main ideas announced by Thomas Campbell in
   his Declaration and Address in 1809 and championed by Alexander
   Campbell for fifty years thereafter. With some differences of emphasis
   and phrasing, they were the ruling ideas of Stone and the other
   reformers whose work preceded, paralleled, and reinforced his. To this
   day, these are the two foci of interest among Disciples, and every
   difference of opinion which threatens to create parties among them
   revolves about answers to the questions: "Restoration of what?" and
   "What price union?"

   Each of these ideas, union and restoration, has a long history, only a
   small part of which can he told here, but part of which must be told.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Idea of Union

   The essential unity of the church was and is a basic principle of Roman
   Catholicism. It was a formative idea in the Catholic Church of the
   second and third centuries, which had not yet become Roman, and it
   continued to be so through all the history of the imperial church of
   the Middle Ages. The great Protestant reformers of the sixteenth
   century did not cease to be "catholic" in their belief that the church
   was divinely intended to be one body. They wanted to reform the church,
   not to break it into pieces. Efforts to heal the breach with Rome were
   long continued and frequently renewed. But reunion with Rome proved to
   be impossible on any other terms than submission to that usurped
   authority from which they had revolted. Different types of
   Protestantism soon appeared. The principal varieties--Lutheranism,
   Calvinism, Zwinglianism, Anabaptism, episcopal
   Anglicanism--represented, not divisions of an originally united
   Protestantism, but separate and independent revolts from Rome. Among
   these there was a long series of conferences, negotiations, and
   proposals designed to unite, if possible, all Protestants into one
   body. Such efforts continued to be made throughout the seventeenth
   century.

   In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, most people believed that a
   nation could not be politically united unless it had only one church,
   of which all its people were members. Consequently, the power of the
   state was generally used to support one church and to suppress all
   others. "Dissenters" were subjected to various degrees of pressure or
   restraint to induce them to conform to the established church. Only
   gradually did dissenters gain liberty of conscience. The intolerance
   and persecution of which they were the victims meanwhile proved the
   importance that was attached to the unity of the church, at least
   within the limits of each nation. This kind of unity without liberty,
   or compulsory religious unity conceived as an instrument of social
   control and as essential to political stability, was the expression of
   a social philosophy which was carried over from medieval Roman Catholic
   Europe to the modern European nations, both Catholic and Protestant.
   The idea of unity as an important characteristic of the church did not
   need to be invented or even discovered in modern times. It was there
   all the while. But it needed to be liberated from its political
   entanglements, as the church itself did. It needed to be conceived in
   terms consistent with the spiritual nature of the church and the civil
   rights of man. Both the church and the citizen had to be made free.

   Besides the efforts of politicians and ecclesiastics in established
   churches to get church unity by compulsion, there were a few churchmen
   and independent thinkers who argued that unity might be attained by
   requiring agreement only upon the few saving essentials of Christianity
   and leaving everyone free to hold his own opinions on all the doubtful
   and disputatious matters of doctrine, polity, and ritual. Thus the
   Puritan Stillingfleet wrote in his Eirenicon (1662):

     It would bee strange the Church should require more than Christ
     himself did, and make other conditions of her communion than our
     Savior did of Discipleship.... Without all controversie, the main
     in-let of all the distractions, confusions and divisions of the
     Christian world hath been by adding other conditions of
     Church-communion than Christ hath done.

   In very similar words, and only a few years later, the English
   philosopher John Locke argued that, since men differ in their
   interpretations of the Bible and always will, none should seek to
   impose his opinions on another, and that their differences should not
   divide them. In his first Letter Concerning Toleration (1689), Locke
   wrote:

     Since men are so solicitous about the true church, I would only ask
     them here by the way, if it be not more agreeable to the Church of
     Christ to make the conditions of her communion consist in such
     things, and such things only, as the Holy Spirit has in the Holy
     Scriptures declared, in express words, to be necessary to salvation?

   And Rupertius Meldenius made the classic statement of this principle
   when he said: "In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all
   things, charity."

   But the churches did not respond to this appeal for liberty of opinion
   within the church that there might be union of Christians in one
   church. Slowly, however, the governments of most European countries in
   which the Roman Catholic Church did not exercise control yielded to the
   demand for liberty of religious opinion within the state. With this
   grant of toleration to churches which were mutually intolerant, the
   states preserved their unity, while the church sank into a condition of
   complacent sectarianism. During the seventeenth century there had been
   many pleas for church unity through liberty. The eighteenth century
   thought much about liberty and little about unity. But it is to be
   remembered that, when a new call to unity was sounded in America at the
   beginning of the nineteenth century, it was the renewal of a campaign
   that already had a long history. It came at a time when the churches in
   America, happy in the complete liberty they enjoyed and in their
   freedom from state control and equality before the law, had ceased to
   be much concerned about unity and had settled into the conviction that
   division and denominationalism represented the normal condition of the
   church.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Idea of Restoration

   The other principle stressed by "the reformation of the nineteenth
   century" was the restoration of primitive Christianity. That also had a
   long history, which can be only sketched. Thomas and Alexander Campbell
   made a new use of this idea, and it will have a large place in the
   story of their work, but in order to understand their contribution it
   is necessary to note that the idea itself was not new. The oldest
   Christian bodies claim to have preserved primitive Christianity
   uncorrupted, and every reforming movement in the history of the church
   has claimed in some sense to offer a restoration of its pristine
   purity. A few citations, among many that might be offered, will make
   this clear.

   The Roman Catholic Church professes to present original Christianity
   unchanged. "What Christ made it in the beginning, that must it ever
   remain," says Rev. B. J. Otten, S.J., in The Catholic Church and Modern
   Christianity. A representative of the Eastern Orthodox Church more
   recently wrote: "The Russian Church, having alone preserved the picture
   of Christ, must restore that picture to Europe." A Chinese Nestorian
   who visited Europe in the thirteenth century said to the College of
   Cardinals: "As for us Orientals, the Holy Apostles taught us, and up to
   the present we hold fast to what they have committed to us."

   The great reformers of the sixteenth century conceived of their work as
   clearing away the human additions and getting back to primitive
   Christianity as found in the Bible. Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin all
   made their appeal directly to Scripture. Bucer exhorted believers to
   "reject all false speculations and all human opinions." The Anabaptists
   cited the example of the first Christians as their authority for
   refusing to have a creed or to bear arms or to take oaths or to hold
   civil office, and Melchior Hofmann announced a "resurrection of
   primitive Christianity." When Queen Elizabeth was masquerading as a
   Lutheran, for diplomatic reasons, she said she would hold to the
   Augsburg Confession because it "conformed most closely to the faith of
   the early church." Chillingworth stated the principle of the
   Reformation in the words, "The Bible and the Bible alone is the
   religion of Protestants," excluding ecclesiastical tradition because it
   furnished neither legitimate additions to the primitive faith and
   practice nor trustworthy evidence as to what these had been.
   Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and Congregationalists, in
   seventeenth-century England, all claimed the authority and example of
   the New Testament church in support of their respective forms of church
   organization and their conceptions of the ministry.

   One modern Lutheran writer declares that "the Lutheran Church is the
   old original church," and another that "Lutheranism is Bible
   Christianity." A book issued by the Presbyterian Board of Publication
   says that "of all the churches now existing in the world, the
   Presbyterian Church comes nearest to the apostolic model." John Wesley
   wrote to the Methodists in America after the Revolution that, being
   free from the English state and hierarchy, they "are now at full
   liberty to follow the Scriptures and the primitive church."

   More secular thinkers have made similar appeal to the ancient standards
   as the cure for the modern church's ills. Rousseau "only wanted to
   simplify Christianity and bring it back to its origins," says A. Aulard
   in his work on Christianity and the French Revolution. John Adams wrote
   in 1770: "Where do we find a precept in the Gospel requiring
   ecclesiastical synods, councils, creeds, oaths, subscriptions, and
   whole cart-loads of other trumpery that we find religion encumbered
   with in these days?"

   These references do not, of course, prove that all or any of those who
   claimed to follow the primitive model actually did so. The point is
   that they claimed to do it. The restoration of primitive purity has
   been the standard formula for reformation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Eighteenth Century Restorationists

   In the eighteenth century there arose, in Great Britain, some movements
   which applied the restoration formula in a way that contributed more
   directly to the Campbells' use of it than those already mentioned. None
   of these gained a large following, and even their names have been
   forgotten by all except special students of the period. Their leaders
   were bold and independent spirits who saw that the church needed
   reforming and were not afraid to attempt it. They laid hold of a great
   idea, but they were never able to build a substantial enterprise upon
   it. Yet they handed it down to those who could.

   John Glas, a minister of the Church of Scotland, about 1727 came to the
   conviction that, since the New Testament church had no connection with
   the state, the whole scheme of establishment as embodied in the
   "National Covenant" was without authority. Further, he found no warrant
   for synods or other law-making bodies with power to fix standards of
   doctrine for the whole church and exercise discipline over it. He
   therefore left the state church and organized an independent
   congregation. He next inquired how this autonomous local church should
   order its affairs, conduct its worship, and establish its ministry.
   Finding that the New Testament churches "came together on the first day
   of the week to break bread," whereas the Presbyterian Church of
   Scotland observed the Lord's Supper no oftener than once a month, Glas
   and his associates adopted the practice of weekly communion. "They
   agreed that in this, as in everything else," says his biographer, "they
   ought to be followers of the first Christians, being guided and
   directed by the Scriptures alone."

   Further, Glas found that in the early churches there was a "plurality
   of elders" and that "mutual edification" was practiced--that is, that
   public services of worship were not conducted solely by one ordained
   minister. This opened the way for a large degree of lay leadership and
   less emphasis on the special functions of the clergy. After it was
   observed that the Epistles of Paul made no mention of a university
   education or a knowledge of the ancient languages among the
   qualifications for the eldership, the line between clergy and laity
   grew still more dim.

   Robert Sandeman, who married one of Glas's daughters, adopted his
   principles and gave them a somewhat more vigorous advocacy, so that the
   resulting churches were more often called "Sandemanian" than "Glasite."
   Through their combined efforts, there came into existence a few small
   churches, probably never more than a dozen or two, in various parts of
   Scotland and England. Michael Faraday, the famous chemist, was a member
   of a Sandemanian church in London. Apparently not more than six or
   eight such churches were organized in America, and not all these were
   known by that name or acknowledged any special connection with Glas or
   Sandeman. Their basic theory led them to "call no man master" and to
   exercise their liberty in deciding, from their own study of Scripture,
   what should be their faith and practice. Robert Sandeman spent his last
   years in Danbury, Connecticut, where he died in 1771, after organizing
   a church there. There were Sandemanian churches in Boston. All of them
   in this country, so far as known, were in New England.

   Glas and Sandeman did not find that the New Testament churches
   practiced only the immersion of believers as baptism. But some of their
   associates in Scotland did. Archibald McLean was the leader of these.
   They came to be called "Old Scotch Baptists." In coming to this
   position they seem not to have been influenced by the English Baptists
   but were moved by their own independent study of the New Testament.
   Similarly, some of the members of Sandeman's church in Danbury later
   reached the same conviction, withdrew, and formed an immersionist
   "Church of Christ."

   Although the Sandemanians remained few and inconspicuous, Robert
   Sandeman himself was a theological thinker of great ability and
   clarity. His writings were widely read and highly regarded by many who
   had no affiliation with his movement and who did not share his views
   about the importance of reproducing exactly the model of the primitive
   church. This was especially true of his treatises dealing with the
   nature of faith and with the priority of faith to repentance. If this
   now seems a dry and technical matter, it did not seem so then and it
   had very practical implications. The gist of his thought on this point
   was that it is within the power of every man to believe the gospel and
   obey its commands to his own salvation. The more popular theory among
   eighteenth-century evangelicals was that sinful and "fallen" man has no
   power to believe. He can repent and "mourn" for the sinful state which
   he inherited from Adam, but then he must wait for a special and
   miraculous act of enabling grace to give him faith. This gift of faith
   and regeneration will be certified to him by an exalted state of
   feeling which constitutes his religious experience and is the evidence
   of his "acceptance with God."

   Against this, Sandeman put the doctrine that God had not only revealed
   his truth in terms intelligible to man and provided the means of
   salvation through Christ, but had also furnished in Scripture adequate
   evidence of the truth of his revelation, so that the natural man, just
   as he is, with all his sins, can weigh the evidence and accept the
   truth. That acceptance is faith. Saving faith, said Sandeman, is an act
   of man's reason, and it differs from any other act of belief only in
   being belief of a saving fact.

   This view of faith came to have immense importance in the history of
   the Disciples. They developed from it, as Sandeman did not, the method
   of a very successful evangelism. There were other influences besides
   that of Sandeman which led Alexander Campbell to this view, especially
   the philosophy of John Locke and, above all, his own study of the New
   Testament. But it is known that he had read Sandeman's writings
   carefully in his youth and regarded them highly, and the similarity of
   his view to Sandeman's on this point cannot be regarded as purely
   coincidental. A Baptist writer later tried to prove that the Disciples
   were "an offshoot of Sandemanianism." (Whitsitt: The Origin of the
   Disciples of Christ, 1888.) "Offshoot" is the wrong word; a mighty
   river is not an offshoot from a tiny trickle. But there was undoubtedly
   an influence: first, in the emphasis upon restoring the procedure of
   the primitive church; second, in the conception of faith as intelligent
   belief based on evidence.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Restoration and Division

   Two wealthy brothers, Robert and James Alexander Haldane, laymen of the
   Church of Scotland, became alarmed at the state of religion in their
   country. It seemed to them that the church had become merely a
   respectable institution enjoying the patronage of the state, supporting
   a clergy chiefly concerned about their own professional dignity and
   privileges, and doing little to carry a vital gospel to those who
   needed it most. At their own expense, while still members of the Church
   of Scotland, they attempted to start a mission to India (which was
   frustrated by the East India Company), brought twenty-four native
   children from Africa to be educated in England and sent back to
   evangelize their own people (but the Anglican Church took them over),
   built tabernacles for evangelistic meetings, sent agents through
   Scotland to organize Sunday schools, and established institutes for the
   training of lay preachers. Beginning with no very definite theology or
   theory about the church, they gradually came to the belief that the
   chief trouble with the church was its departure from the primitive
   pattern as described in the New Testament.

   In 1799 the Haldane brothers withdrew from the Church of Scotland and
   organized an independent church in Edinburgh. Acting on the advice of
   Greville Ewing, a minister who was in charge of their training school
   in Glasgow, they adopted the congregational form of organization and
   the weekly communion as being in accordance with the usage of the
   apostolic churches. Soon they became earnest advocates of the
   restoration of primitive Christianity by following in all respects the
   pattern of the New Testament churches. J. A. Haldane published, in
   1805, a book entitled, A View of the Social Worship and Ordinances of
   the First Christians, Drawn from the Scriptures alone; Being an Attempt
   to Enforce their Divine Obligation, and to Represent the Guilty and
   Evil Consequences of Neglecting them. This book contains an argument
   for infant baptism on the ground that it was the apostolic practice,
   but two years later the Haldanes decided that the evidence of Scripture
   was against this position, so they gave it up and were immersed.

   Other Haldanean churches sprang up, both in Great Britain and in
   America. There were never many of them. No organization bound them
   together, they had no cooperative work, and they took no distinctive
   name. But they swelled the number of those scattered and independent
   "Churches of Christ" which were attempting, with somewhat differing
   results, to restore the primitive order. The tendency of all these
   churches was toward a rather literalistic and legalistic interpretation
   of Scripture, with special emphasis upon exact conformity to a pattern
   of ordinances, organization, and worship. A few years later, two of
   these churches, one in Edinburgh and the other in New York, engaged in
   an earnest but very courteous argument by correspondence as to whether
   the New Testament commanded that the worship service be opened with a
   hymn or with a prayer. Each quoted what seemed relevant and convincing
   texts: "First of all giving thanks" meant prayer first; "Enter into his
   courts with praise" meant hymn first.

   The Sandemanian churches also, in their anxiety to do everything
   exactly as the first churches had done, took as binding commands for
   all time many texts generally considered mere descriptions of customs
   of the first century or instructions suitable to that time. Thus they
   "saluted one another with a holy kiss" (Romans 16:16); considered
   private wealth sinful (Acts 2:44, 45), though they did not actually
   practice community of goods; made a weekly collection for the poor (1
   Cor. 16:2); partook of a common meal in connection with the Lord's
   Supper (Acts 2:46); and for a time practiced foot washing (John 13:14).
   They practiced close communion even to the extent of excluding those of
   their own number who opposed infant baptism.

   None of these churches--Sandemanian, Haldanean and other--showed any
   special interest in Christian unity. Indeed, there was not much
   division in Scotland, where they originated, for almost everybody was
   Presbyterian. The restoration of primitive Christianity was, for them,
   a movement not toward unity but away from it. They were little
   interested in being united with other Christians, but were anxious to
   be right, let who would be wrong. Their insistence upon conformity to
   an exact pattern of supposedly primitive procedure, about which there
   were sure to be differences of opinion, tended toward division. This
   was doubtless one reason why their success was so small.

   Many other small and independent groups of restorers of primitive
   Christianity arose in Great Britain in the eighteenth century and the
   first years of the nineteenth. One writer claims to have listed forty,
   but the present author has not been able to find so many. They adopted
   names of confusing similarity, either "Church of Christ" or some name
   of which "Brethren" formed a part. They came and went, united and
   divided. Though most of the groups disappeared, the type persisted. It
   is now represented at its best, and with important modifications and
   additions, in the British "Churches of Christ" which are in communion
   with the Disciples of Christ in America.

   For three hundred years Protestantism had been based on the idea that
   the Scriptures were the only guide, and the restoration of the
   essential features of primitive Christianity the only method, for
   reforming the church. In the sixteenth century, after freedom from the
   Roman hierarchy and from bondage to ecclesiastical tradition had been
   won, the effort was chiefly to restore the pure doctrine of the
   apostles. In the seventeenth, attention was given to restoring a
   divinely authorized form of church polity, which some held to be
   episcopal, others presbyterial, others congregational. When the major
   divisions of Protestantism had crystallized around their respective
   bodies of doctrine and systems of polity, the restoration concept
   passed out of their minds. It was taken up by smaller groups of
   dissenters and irregulars who, in the eighteenth century, scarcely
   noticed by the larger bodies, bent their energies to restoring the
   ordinances and worship of the church, as well as its structure,
   according to what they conceived to be the original pattern.

   When Thomas and Alexander Campbell adopted the familiar formula of
   restoration and combined it with a plea for union, they gave it a
   different application and produced a strikingly different result.

CHAPTER III
THE AMERICAN SCENE

   Three things must be noted as characteristic of America in the period
   which witnessed the beginnings of the Disciples of Christ. First, this
   was a very young nation. Its population was small. Its frontier, which
   began even east of the Allegheny Mountains, was sparsely settled, but
   settlers were pouring into it rapidly. The Disciples began on the
   frontier and moved westward with it. Second, the country's religious
   forces were divided into five or six large sects of approximately equal
   size and many more small ones. The members of all these together
   constituted only a small fraction, perhaps 10 per cent, of the total
   population. In no other country was so large a proportion of the people
   religiously unattached. Third, America had a kind and a degree of
   religious liberty which had never before existed anywhere in
   Christendom. Church and state were separated; the support of the
   churches was purely voluntary; no church had legal advantage or social
   pre-eminence over others; and every man had complete liberty to adopt
   any form of worship and belief he thought right (or none), to propagate
   his faith without hindrance, or to start a new religious organization
   if he so desired. This combination of circumstances had never before
   existed. These factors in the environment are immensely important for
   our study.

   Since the movements which produced the Disciples of Christ began so
   near the beginning of the nineteenth century, we may take the year 1800
   as a suitable point at which to make a cross section of the United
   States and observe, in a very general way, the state of the nation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  America in 1800

   George Washington had died the year before. John Adams was president.
   The country consisted of sixteen states, only Vermont, Kentucky, and
   Tennessee having been added to the original thirteen. It had a
   population of 5,308,483, less than 10 per cent of whom lived west of
   the Alleghenies. (Twenty years later, in spite of the great westward
   movement, 73 per cent of the people were still on the Atlantic slope.)
   The population, wealth, industries, and cultural institutions were very
   largely concentrated not only east of the mountains but in the eastern
   part of the area east of the mountains. The Atlantic tidewater belt,
   from Boston to Charleston, contained the great preponderance of
   everything that made this a nation--except its land, its undeveloped
   resources, and its pioneering spirit. But the eastern cities that loom
   so large in history were still small: Philadelphia, 28,522; Boston,
   24,037; New York, with 60,515 within the boundaries of present-day
   Manhattan, had already taken first place. In the summer of 1800 the
   seat of the national government was moved from Philadelphia to the
   unfinished buildings in the almost uninhabited area that was to become
   the city of Washington.

   The vast region now occupied by the five populous states west of the
   Alleghenies and north of the Ohio River had a grand total of 51,000
   inhabitants. It had been organized as the Northwest Territory under the
   Ordinance of 1787, and the Indians had been moved out of the eastern
   and southern parts of it in 1795 under a treaty forced upon them after
   Anthony Wayne's expedition against them. Pittsburgh was a town of
   1,565, the head of navigation on the Ohio. In 1803 the state of Ohio
   was carved out of the Northwest Territory. By 1830 it had a population
   of more than 900,000. So urgent was the drive toward the open frontier
   and so rapid the development of its communities that, while trying to
   realize the newness and emptiness of the region at a given period, one
   must be on guard against failing to realize the rate of change.
   Moreover, some parts of the area were much more advanced than others.

   Kentucky was about a generation ahead of the adjacent Northwest
   Territory in settlement and culture. It had a college, the first west
   of the mountains, even before it got statehood in 1792. By 1800 it had
   a population of 220,000. Lexington, a town of 1,797 (including 439
   slaves), its metropolis, the seat of the college, and the social and
   economic center of the Bluegrass Region, could make a plausible claim
   to the title, "the Athens of the West." The churches came to Kentucky,
   as they did everywhere, with the first wave of settlers. By 1800 the
   Presbyterians had a synod and several presbyteries. The most numerous
   body was the Baptists, who reported 106 churches with 5,000 members.
   The Methodists, with perhaps half that number in the state, organized a
   Western Conference the next year, composed of circuits in Kentucky,
   Tennessee, and the Northwest Territory. These were the three vigorous
   and aggressive churches on the frontier.

   The Mississippi River was the western boundary of the United States
   (until 1803), and Florida was still a Spanish possession. Louisiana
   Territory and Florida were both held by Roman Catholic powers, and
   Protestant churches were not permitted.
     __________________________________________________________________

  American Churches in 1800

   The term, "the Church," had little meaning in America at and after the
   beginning of the federal period. There was no Church, either as a
   visible and functioning reality or as an ideal; there were only
   churches. If we call them "sects," it is not to criticize but simply to
   describe the fact that the church had been cut into many parts. In view
   of the kind of compulsory unity (or attempted unity) in European and
   British Christianity out of which these sects arose, the divisions were
   not to their discredit. Sectarianism was a stage through which
   Christianity had to pass on the road to freedom and unity. But the fact
   of division is the one now before us.

   The largest denominations were the Congregational, Episcopal,
   Presbyterian, Baptist, and Methodist. There were also important bodies
   of Dutch Reformed, German Reformed, French Huguenots, Lutherans,
   Quakers, and Roman Catholics, and such smaller groups as the Moravians,
   Mennonites, Dunkers, Schwenkfelders, and the Ephrata Society.

   The original settlement of the first Atlantic Seaboard colonies,
   especially Virginia and New England, combined the religious with the
   economic motive. Even the nationalistic impulse to extend British power
   was as much religious as political, for it included zeal for the
   extension of Protestantism on a scale to match and check the Spanish
   Roman Catholic empire which already included Florida, the West Indies,
   Mexico, and most of South America.

   Virginia was Anglican by intention, but from the start the Puritan
   element in both the company and the colony was strong. When the first
   settlement was made, and for a good while after, the Puritans were
   still a party in the Church of England. Episcopacy remained established
   in Virginia until the Revolution, though there was a strong influx of
   Scotch-Irish (Presbyterian, of course) and of Baptists in the
   eighteenth century. Since there was no Anglican bishop in America
   during all these years, there could be no confirmations. As always with
   established churches, nominal adherents greatly outnumbered
   communicants, and many were content with a "gentlemanly conformity."
   Episcopacy was established also in North and South Carolina, though it
   never had a majority in either colony, and in New York after the
   British took it from the Dutch in 1667.

   The great Puritan migration to New England had for its religious
   purpose the founding of a Puritan state somewhat on the pattern of
   Calvin's Geneva. The developments of the seventeenth and eighteenth
   centuries produced, instead, a group of colonies--states in the
   American union by 1800--in which Congregationalism was the "standing
   order," or established church, and one state, Rhode Island, in which,
   thanks to Roger Williams and the Baptists, complete religious liberty,
   deliberately adopted as a matter of conviction, got its first fair
   trial as a principle of government. But Congregationalism, though
   clinging to some of its legal advantages, had also grown tolerant,
   partly because dissenters and noncommunicants had become so very
   numerous. As early as 1760, the president of Yale estimated that 12 per
   cent in the four New England colonies were dissenters, and that not
   more than one-fifth of the others were communicant members of
   Congregational churches.

   New England Congregationalism, though already disturbed by the
   theological controversy which later produced the Unitarian defection,
   was in the main soundly Calvinistic. It differed from Presbyterianism
   only in its tradition of the independence of the local church, and even
   this was qualified by the growth of what was called "associationism" by
   those who viewed it with alarm. So, when an interest in home missions
   began to appear, about 1800, the Plan of Union was formed under which
   Congregationalists and Presbyterians cooperated until 1837 in carrying
   the gospel to the new settlements, first in western New York and then
   in the regions beyond. The Presbyterians ultimately got most of the
   churches organized in the Middle West by Congregational missionaries
   operating under this plan.

   Presbyterians came from England, Scotland, and North Ireland. They
   never had a colony of their own, though they missed having
   Massachusetts Bay only because the Presbyterian Puritans who founded it
   became Congregational. Puritans who came to other colonies generally
   were and remained Presbyterians. They found a footing in New York, New
   Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia and were among
   the first settlers of Kentucky. Pennsylvania became the scene of some
   of their most vigorous activities, both in and around Philadelphia and
   in the central and western part, where they were the most numerous and
   influential group. William Tennent's "Log College" at Neshaminy (1720)
   initiated theological education in America, at least outside of
   Harvard's effort to provide a learned clergy for New England. It
   trained evangelists as well as scholars, and led to the founding of
   Princeton. The great Scotch-Irish immigration, about the middle of the
   eighteenth century, brought both regular Presbyterians, in communion
   with the Church of Scotland, and Seceder Presbyterians, representing
   the Great Secession of 1733. Large numbers of both came to the western
   parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia, where these Presbyterian Ulstermen
   "formed an American Ulster larger and richer than that they had
   abandoned," as one of them wrote, with some exaggeration of the degree
   of their occupancy though not of the size and resources of the area.
   Thomas Campbell was following a stream of Scotch-Irish Seceder
   Presbyterians when he migrated from the vicinity of Belfast, Ireland,
   to the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania.

   Baptist beginnings in America are easily localized in Rhode Island, but
   their dispersal and multiplication cannot be simply diagramed. They
   went everywhere, on their individual initiative, with no general
   organization, were persecuted wherever intolerance ruled, and generally
   despised by their more conventional and respectable neighbors, chiefly
   because they insisted that religion was a purely voluntary matter, that
   Christian, Turk, Jew, or atheist should be allowed to follow his own
   convictions about faith and worship, and that the state had nothing to
   do with it. That position seemed almost equivalent to anarchy. The fact
   that most of the Baptist preachers were ignorant men, or self-taught
   and uncouth, and that a great many of them were farmers six days in the
   week and preachers only on Sunday, made the matter worse. But the
   Baptists did have a college, founded in 1764, which became Brown
   University. In cities and towns their preachers became more urbane, but
   they kept the aggressiveness and the popular appeal which brought
   immense success to their cause in the Middle West and in the South.
   Regular Baptists were Calvinistic. Their Philadelphia Confession, which
   was very similar in doctrine to the Presbyterians' Westminster
   Confession, was commonly used as a standard of orthodoxy. It taught
   that Christ died only for the elect. But there were also "General
   Baptists," who believed in a general atonement, or that Christ died for
   all. The difference between the two became significant.

   Methodism in America began when two or three lay preachers came in the
   1760's, and when John Wesley sent two preachers from England in 1769.
   But the revival of 1740, known as the Great Awakening, had prepared the
   way for it. Through the Revolution and until 1784, Methodism remained
   nominally a movement in the Anglican Church, but it had its societies,
   preachers, classes, and circuits, and its evangelists converted
   thousands of the religiously indifferent. Formal organization began
   with the Christmas conference, 1784. The Methodist system of
   supervision by "superintendents," who promptly became bishops, and by
   presiding elders, with preachers riding circuits and class leaders
   conserving local gains, constituted a planned economy in the business
   of serving the religious needs of the frontier. But without tireless
   energy and zealous devotion, all this machinery could not have been
   effective. Methodism began on the Atlantic Seaboard and it had good
   success there, but the scene of its most spectacular growth was in the
   West and South. By 1800 the Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians had
   become the great "popular churches" on the frontier; and the frontier
   itself was on the verge of a startlingly rapid transformation.

   It must not be supposed that the attitudes of the denominations toward
   each other were altogether those of mutual hostility and competition,
   or even of isolation. There was much of this, but there was also much
   of mutual respect and friendliness. From 1800 to about 1837 there was a
   noticeable increase of cooperation among the members of many
   denominations. This is seen in the earliest phases of Sunday school
   work, in Bible publication and distribution, in certain aspects of
   foreign and home missionary activity, and in the antislavery and
   temperance societies. But the most conspicuous feature of American
   Christianity continued to be its divided state.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Land of the Free

   One reason for this sectarian condition was that this was a free
   country. Under the First Amendment to the Constitution, which is the
   first article of the Bill of Rights, no church could ever receive
   special favors from the government nor could there be discrimination
   against any. When the American Government adopted this hands-off
   policy, leaving the whole matter of religion to the churches and to the
   people, the old compulsory unity disappeared--even the ghost of unity
   which England had, with its one national church and a number of
   "dissenting" bodies still under certain legal handicaps.

   It is little wonder that America had many churches. Colonists had come
   from many countries bringing all the varieties of religion that existed
   in all those countries. Many of them had come as refugees from
   persecution. In later years, some divisions occurred on American soil,
   but the sects that were here in 1800 had all been imported from Europe.

   Moreover, since the United States was formed by the union of thirteen
   colonies, the new nation, of course, had as many different churches as
   all the colonies together had had. In some colonies, especially Rhode
   Island, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, there had been a considerable
   variety of churches enjoying equal liberty. In others the situation was
   much as it was in England at the same time, with their established
   churches and with dissenting bodies existing as best they could under
   the shadow of the favored church. The founders and builders of the
   American colonies, with a few exceptions, had not believed in the
   separation of church and state or in equal liberty for all religious
   groups. But the idea of religious liberty had been growing, and the
   multiplicity of churches in the new nation made the establishment of
   any one of them as the national church a practical impossibility. No
   one even suggested it in the Constitutional Convention of 1787.

   It is hard for us now to realize how continuous and almost universal
   had been the belief that the welfare of the state was bound up with
   religious uniformity. For more than a thousand years, and throughout
   Christendom, practically everybody except little bands of heretics and
   rebels believed that the institutional unity of the church was
   essential to the security of the state and the stability of the social
   order, and that it was the state's duty to enforce this unity. That
   belief furnished the reason--and when not the reason, the excuse--for
   most of the persecutions that have occurred. Roman Catholics, of
   course, believed it, and it is still the official teaching of the Roman
   Catholic Church. But most Protestants also believed it. Only the
   Baptists and Quakers and some small separatist sects in Germany
   believed in religious liberty as a matter of principle. But the
   established and respectable bodies considered these as wild-eyed
   radicals.

   Episcopalians and Puritans who founded colonies in America brought with
   them this idea of a state church and a religious unity enforced by the
   police power, not because they were bigoted or cruel by preference but
   because they believed, as almost everybody had believed for centuries,
   that in no other way could a political society be strong enough to
   survive. Surprise is sometimes expressed at the "inconsistency" of the
   Puritans, who "came seeking religious liberty" and then persecuted the
   Quakers and Baptists. But there is no inconsistency, for they did not
   come seeking religious liberty. They came to establish a Puritan state.
   They had to learn religious liberty after they arrived, and they were
   rather slow in learning it. But even the vestiges of the colonial
   religious establishments withered away after the Revolution, and
   America became, in fact as well as in constitutional theory, a nation
   in which all churches, like all individuals, are free and equal before
   the law.

   A new epoch in the history of religion began when a nation was born
   which (a) disclaimed for its civil power the right and duty of giving
   special protection to a favored church, (b) declared implicitly, as the
   Virginia Bill of Rights in 1776 had done explicitly, that religion must
   be purely voluntary, and (c) abandoned the medieval political
   philosophy which justified intolerance on the theory that the state
   must enforce religious uniformity in the interest of its own stability
   and security.

   These new American conditions had, among others, three results that are
   of vital importance in connection with the present study:

   First, the removal of the repressive hand of government made it easier
   for new religious movements to spring up or for old ones to divide.
   Hence new divisions in the church arose in addition to those which had
   been imported from Europe. The divided state of the Christian forces
   became more acute and called more urgently for correction.

   Second, the problem of Christian union ceased to be in any sense a
   political problem and became a purely religious problem to be solved by
   religious means. Seventeenth century advocates of union had, to be
   sure, preached brotherly love and made some statements about uniting on
   the simple essentials of Christianity; but they had sought support
   largely from political leaders, trying to show them how a national
   church, united by making concessions to bring back the dissenters,
   would increase the nation's strength, or how an alliance between the
   churches of different countries would be a good stroke of diplomacy.
   The conceptions of complete religious liberty for the individual and of
   free churches in a free state introduced an entirely new approach to
   the question of union. Those conceptions had to be thoroughly worked
   out before the problem of Christian union in the modern sense--which is
   also the primitive sense--could even be stated; and they had to be made
   operative in government before a solution could be hopefully attempted.
   There had to be complete freedom to divide before there could be a
   union that would not deny freedom.

   Third, separation of church and state and recognition of the voluntary
   character of religion threw directly upon the members of churches the
   whole responsibility for supporting the churches and promoting their
   work by voluntary contributions. The Christian discovery and conquest
   of America was to be organized and financed on a voluntary basis.

   Such, in bare outline, was the American scene in which the forerunners
   and fathers of the Disciples of Christ, about the beginning of the
   nineteenth century, began to advocate a simple and noncreedal
   Christianity, the union of all Christians on the basis of the essential
   and primitive conditions of discipleship, and the restoration of such
   features of the "ancient order of things" as might be agreed upon as
   designed to be permanent practices of the church.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV
THE "CHRISTIANS"

   The longest direct tributary to the stream which became the Disciples
   of Christ is the movement with which the name of Barton W. Stone is
   generally associated. This took visible form when he and his four
   colleagues dissolved the Springfield Presbytery, in 1804, and took the
   name "Christians." Back of this, however, lay two other movements which
   led to the formation of "Christian" churches. Stone was certainly fully
   informed about the first of these before taking his own step, but
   probably not about the second. The three were so nearly identical in
   principles and objectives that they considered themselves as
   constituting a single body as soon as they learned of one another's
   work and long before they had any organizational unity. We shall
   consider the three parts of the "Christian" Church in the order of
   their origin. The first was a secession from the Methodists, the second
   from the Baptists, the third from the Presbyterians.
     __________________________________________________________________

  In Virginia and North Carolina, 1794

   Methodism was not a denomination but only a revival movement in the
   Church of England until the end of the Revolutionary War. In 1771, John
   Wesley sent Francis Asbury from England. He became the most important
   factor in winning converts, enlisting workers, setting up the system of
   circuits and itinerant preachers, and organizing the church. By 1784,
   about 15,000 members were enrolled in Methodist societies in Virginia
   and the adjacent states. But these societies were not churches. They
   had no ordained ministers and therefore could not have the sacraments.
   Asbury himself was still a lay preacher. The Virginia Methodist
   preachers voted to break away from the Anglican Church, but Asbury,
   backed by Wesley, resisted. The end of the war and the independence of
   the American colonies changed the situation. Wesley sent over, by the
   hand of Dr. Coke, a letter which has become a famous document. Part of
   it has been quoted in another connection. In conclusion Wesley wrote:

     As our American brethren are now totally disentangled from the state
     and from the English hierarchy, we dare not entangle them again
     either with the one or the other. They are now at full liberty
     simply to follow the Scriptures and the primitive church. And we
     judge it best that they should stand fast in that liberty with which
     God has so strangely made them free.

   (It seemed strange to Wesley that God should wish the American colonies
   to be free from Great Britain, an outcome to which he himself had been
   bitterly opposed.)

   Wesley's letter was read to a conference which met on Christmas Eve,
   1784, at Baltimore. The conference declared the independence of
   Methodism, adopted the name "The Methodist Episcopal Church," and
   ordained Asbury as deacon, elder, and superintendent. James O'Kelly and
   twelve others were ordained as elders. Simultaneously with counseling
   the American brethren to follow the primitive church and stand fast in
   their liberty, Wesley had appointed Asbury and Coke to be
   "superintendents" of American Methodism. Coke soon returned to England,
   and Asbury changed his own title to that of "bishop" and assumed such
   powers as no Anglican bishop or Methodist superintendent in England
   ever had. For one thing, Asbury assigned every preacher to his field,
   every presiding elder to his district, and from his assignments there
   was no appeal.

   James O'Kelly had become a Methodist lay preacher in 1775, when he was
   about forty years old. He had been one of "Asbury's Ironsides," and had
   been the leader of those who urged an earlier separation from the
   Anglican Church. He had also led the futile protest against Asbury's
   assumption of the title of "bishop." Asbury had made him a presiding
   elder, but he continued to be the head and front of the resistance to
   the bishop's autocracy. When a demand for the "right of appeal" was
   voted down by a general conference in 1792, O'Kelly and a number of
   other preachers withdrew. A year later they organized the "Republican
   Methodist Church," with about thirty ministers and 1,000 members. This
   stage of the independent movement lasted only seven months.

   On August 4, 1794, the Republican Methodists met in conference at Old
   Lebanon Church, in Surry County, Virginia, and adopted as their name
   "The Christian Church." This name was suggested by Rice Haggard,
   formerly a Methodist lay preacher and one of O'Kelly's partners in
   protest from the beginning. The members of the conference resolved,
   further, to take the Bible as their only creed. They had discovered, as
   one of them put it, that "the primitive church government, which came
   down from heaven, was a republic, though Christian Church' is its
   name." All preachers were to be on an equal footing. Ministers and
   laymen were to have liberty of private judgment. Conferences were to be
   merely advisory, and each congregation should "call its own pastor and
   enjoy the greatest possible freedom." It is to be noted that this
   secession from the Methodist Church involved no dissent from Methodist
   doctrine. It grew solely out of dissatisfaction with that church's
   system of government. The type of religious thought and preaching in
   the separated group remained substantially Methodist.

   The new movement started with a staff of experienced and zealous
   ministers, under whose influence a considerable number of Methodist
   churches now became "Christian." The Methodist Church in Virginia and
   North Carolina suffered a net loss of 3,670, in spite of its vigorous
   evangelism, during the first year of the "Christian" church. Fifteen
   years later it was estimated that the Christian Church had 20,000
   members "in the southern and western states." This doubtless includes
   Kentucky and Tennessee.

  In New England, 1801

   The first "Christian Church" in New England was about seven years later
   than the first in the South, and its origin was entirely unrelated to
   the earlier one. The New England movement got its impulse from the
   independent reactions of two young men against the type of religion
   they found in the Baptist churches of which they were members and in
   which they began to preach. These churches were Calvinistic in their
   emphasis on original sin, the limitation of the benefits of Christ's
   atonement to the "elect," the wrath of God toward sinners, the threat
   of hell, and the inability of man to do anything for his own salvation.

   Elias Smith, born in 1769 at Lyme, Connecticut, spent his boyhood under
   very crude frontier conditions in a new settlement in Vermont, and had
   a violent experience of conversion when a log fell on him in the woods.
   He joined the Baptist church, and began to preach when he was about
   twenty-one. In spite of his almost complete lack of education, the
   Baptist ministers of Boston ordained him two years later. For almost a
   decade he was a somewhat irregular Baptist preacher, improving his
   education by diligent private study, becoming more and more
   dissatisfied with orthodox Calvinism, seeking a way out of his
   confusion by independent study of the New Testament, and moving toward
   the conviction that the churches should abandon their theological and
   ecclesiastical systems and restore the simple faith and practice of the
   primitive church.

   Abner Jones, born in 1772 at Royalton, Massachusetts, had a Vermont
   boyhood not unlike Smith's in its combination of frontier hardship,
   lack of schools, and torturing religious experience. Having achieved
   conversion, he joined the Baptist church, taught school for a time,
   then studied and practiced medicine by the short-cut "Thompsonian"
   system; but he also preached as opportunity offered. Still in his early
   twenties, he "quit the fellowship of the Calvinist Baptists," as his
   biographer testifies, after hearing Elias Smith preach, though Smith
   was then still a Baptist. As the result of his own thinking, stirred by
   Smith's influence, Jones organized an independent church at Lyndon,
   Vermont, in the Autumn of 1801, to which he would give no name but
   "Christian." This, says the historian of the movement, was "the first
   Christian church in New England." During the next year Jones secured
   ordination by three Free Will Baptist preachers--not as a Baptist but
   "only as a Christian"--and organized "Christian" churches at Hanover
   and Piermont, New Hampshire. Up to this time, Smith had been the leader
   in thought but had hesitated to break his Baptist ties. Jones now
   persuaded him to abandon the Baptist name and joined him in organizing
   a "Christian" church at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In 1804 Jones moved
   to Boston and formed a church there.

   These two men, Smith and Jones, lived and worked for nearly forty years
   after that. Jones established churches at Salem, Massachusetts, where
   he lived for several years, and at many other towns in New England,
   never striking root very deeply in any place but winning many followers
   to the movement and a number of preachers to its advocacy. Smith's most
   important contribution was the founding of a religious paper, the
   Herald of Gospel Liberty, the first issue of which was published on
   September 1, 1808, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. With some slight
   intermissions and under a variety of names, finally returning to the
   original one, this journal was published for 122 years and then merged
   with the Congregationalist.

   Within twenty years after the founding of that first "Christian" church
   at Lyndon, Vermont, there were dozens of such churches in New England
   and others in adjacent parts of Canada and in New York and
   Pennsylvania, all deriving from this original impulse. These were, on
   principle, independent churches. No organization directed or controlled
   them and they had no cooperative activities. However, there was a sense
   of fellowship among them and they soon began to hold informal
   conferences. There is record of a meeting of "the elders of the
   Christian Churches in the New England states, assembled at Portsmouth,
   New Hampshire, June 23, 1809," which authorized a fraternal reply to a
   letter from representatives of the Christian Churches in Virginia and
   North Carolina. The "general conference" held at Windham, Connecticut,
   in 1816, and the series of "United States conferences" beginning in
   1820 were really, in spite of their comprehensive names, only
   conferences of the churches in the northeastern states. One of these,
   in 1827, voted that it was not proper for ministers to use the title
   "Reverend" and passed a resolution condemning the use of instrumental
   music in public worship. About thirty regional conferences, by states
   or parts of states, had been organized within this area before 1832.

  In Kentucky, 1804

   Third in order of time, but first in importance in relation to the
   Disciples, among the three movements which together constituted the
   "Christian Church" was the one in which Stone emerged as the leading
   figure.

   Barton W. Stone, born in 1772 at Port Tobacco, Maryland, was a member
   of one of the oldest American families. His
   great-great-great-grandfather was the first Protestant governor of
   Maryland, 1648-53. Barton Stone's father, a man of some property, died
   just before the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, and his mother moved
   with her large family to Pittsylvania County, Virginia, very close to
   the North Carolina line. With his share of the money from his father's
   estate, Barton spent three years in David Caldwell's academy at
   Greensboro, North Carolina, thirty miles southwest of his home. Here he
   "completed the classical course" in 1793. This school was hospitable to
   revivalism. Caldwell himself was a Princeton graduate and a
   Presbyterian minister of the "New Light" type--that is, of evangelistic
   temper and with an easy tolerance in theology. McGready, the
   Presbyterian evangelist who was later to set southern Kentucky afire,
   came to Greensboro and converted most of the students. Stone was
   stirred by the appeal but repelled by the theology. Meanwhile his
   mother, who had been an Anglican, had become a Methodist. William
   Hodge, a young "New Light" Presbyterian, who had been one of Caldwell's
   boys, came preaching the love rather than the wrath of God. Stone
   abandoned his purpose to study law and decided to be that kind of
   Presbyterian preacher. The presbytery to which he applied for license
   directed him to prepare a trial sermon on the Trinity. He struggled
   with the theme, and his sermon was accepted, but he always had trouble
   with the doctrine of the Trinity.

   While waiting for his license to preach, he went to Georgia to visit
   his brother and while there he served for about a year, beginning in
   January, 1795, as "professor of languages" in Succoth Academy, a
   Methodist school at Washington, Georgia. The principal of this academy
   was Hope Hull, a Methodist preacher who had been closely associated
   with O'Kelly in his protest at the Methodist conference two years
   earlier but who had remained with the Methodist Church when O'Kelly and
   the other insurgents withdrew to form the Christian Church. Stone and
   Hull became very intimate friends, and Stone accompanied Hull on a
   journey to Charleston, South Carolina, to attend a Methodist
   conference. John Springer, an ardently evangelistic Presbyterian
   preacher of the "New Light" type, whose field was only a few miles from
   the academy and who had the most cordial relations with the Baptists
   and Methodists in his neighborhood, became another counselor and friend
   and exercised, says Ware, a "decisive influence" on Stone.

   Returning to North Carolina, Stone received his license to preach from
   the hands of the venerable and liberal Henry Pattillo, who, in a
   published sermon on "Divisions among Christians," had recommended the
   name "Christians" as the one "first given to the disciples by divine
   appointment at Antioch," and who declared that men ought to be
   permitted to differ peaceably about the doctrines of religion.

   To summarize the influences of Stone's early background and
   environment, these items may be listed:

     1. The Great Awakening, which, under the preaching of men trained in
     William Tennent's Log College and of George Whitefield, beginning
     about 1740 but echoing through the middle and southern colonies for
     more than half a century after that in the work of Samuel Davies and
     many other evangelistic or "New Light" Presbyterians, had stressed
     the common elements of the gospel and put the divisive doctrines of
     the creeds into a subordinate place.

     2. The Methodist movement, which did not cease to be a revival when
     it became a church and which challenged the Calvinism of the
     Presbyterian creed.

     3. The "Christian" Church, which was having its first rapid growth
     in Virginia and North Carolina while Stone was in the first
     formative stage of his ministry in the same region.

     4. The direct and personal influence of the men who have been
     mentioned in the preceding paragraphs: David Caldwell, James
     McGready, William Hodge, Hope Hull, John Springer, and Henry
     Pattillo.

   After an experimental and not very successful missionary trip which
   took him through the eastern part of North Carolina and back through
   Virginia, and feeling that there was a better field on the frontier,
   Stone headed west, on horseback again. Within three months he had
   ridden to Knoxville and, at some peril from Indians, on to Nashville
   (population 346 by the next census); had associated for a time with
   Thomas Craighead, a Princeton-trained Presbyterian preacher of
   independent mind, famous for his zeal for a "rational and scriptural
   evangelism" and his scant respect for the authority of creed and
   presbytery; had itinerated and preached in the Cumberland district of
   Tennessee; and had then crossed Cumberland Gap into Kentucky, spent a
   little time at Danville and Lexington, and by October, 1796, was
   installed as regular supply pastor of two Presbyterian churches at Cane
   Ridge and Concord. Cane Ridge was seven miles east of Paris; Concord,
   ten miles northeast of Cane Ridge.

   The next year a call to the settled pastorate of his churches made it
   necessary for Stone to seek ordination from the Transylvania
   Presbytery. This would require a declaration of his adherence to the
   Westminster Confession. Renewed study did not resolve his doubts about
   the Trinity. Before facing the presbytery, he privately stated his
   trouble to James Blythe, then probably the most influential
   Presbyterian in Kentucky and later one of the severest critics of
   Stone's views. In the public ceremony, Stone declared his acceptance of
   the Confession "as far as I see it consistent with the Word of God."
   Upon that guarded statement he was ordained.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Cane Ridge Meeting

   The Great Western Revival, with which the names of Stone and Cane Ridge
   are closely associated, resulted from transplanting to Tennessee and
   Kentucky the methods of evangelistic appeal which had been used by "New
   Light" Presbyterians, Methodists, and "Christians" in the Southern
   states east of the mountains. Under frontier conditions it developed
   some bizarre and sensational features which have drawn attention away
   from its real values. It began gradually with the preaching of four or
   five men--especially James McGready and the brothers William and John
   McGee--who had come west about the time Stone came, and who itinerated
   in Tennessee, near and north of Nashville, and the adjacent part of
   Kentucky. For three or four years the revival spirit grew and spread
   until the countryside was in a fever of excitement. Fantastic
   manifestations began to appear among persons who experienced
   "conviction of sin," and even among those who came to scoff--jerking
   and barking, hysterical laughter, falling and lying rigid like dead
   men. These were taken for manifestations of the power of the Holy
   Spirit.

   Stone, who was concerned about religious apathy in his own parishes,
   traveled the nearly two hundred miles from Cane Ridge to Logan County
   in southwestern Kentucky, in the early spring of 1801, to see the
   revival in progress under the preaching of McGready. He was impressed
   with the genuineness of the revival. The physical demonstrations seemed
   to be "the work of God," but inexplicable and not wholly desirable.
   Stone was, in a sense, the advance agent of the revival as it moved
   north and east through Kentucky. By late spring it had reached the
   Bluegrass. On the Sundays of May and June, there were great meetings at
   churches in the area around Lexington, with attendance at the last
   three running to 4,000, then 8,000, then 10,000, according to
   contemporary estimates.

   The climax came in the Cane Ridge camp meeting, which lasted from
   Friday to Wednesday, August 7-12, 1801. The crowd was estimated at
   20,000. Many Presbyterian, several Methodist, and a few Baptist
   ministers preached, often simultaneously at different stations through
   the woods. The excitement was intense. The fantastic "exercises"
   occurred in great profusion. This meeting was held at Stone's church,
   and he had much to do with bringing it about, but it was not in any
   sense his meeting. It does not appear that he was the most prominent
   among the preachers. Richard McNemar, for example, was more
   conspicuous, and so was McNemar's nine-year-old daughter, who became a
   child prophetess and poured forth a torrent of exhortation from a perch
   on his shoulder. Stone rejoiced in the awakened interest in religion
   and in the salvation of many sinners, but the records do not show that
   he gave encouragement to the spectacular "exercises."

   Not all the Presbyterians approved of this violent revivalism. Three
   features especially offended them: the opportunity it gave to preachers
   lacking education; the wild and disorderly physical "exercises"; and
   the stress upon the idea that "Christ died for all," not for a limited
   number, the elect. The issue about education was especially acute in
   southern Kentucky and became one of the grounds for the "Cumberland
   secession" and the formation of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. The
   "exercises" gradually ceased to be a prominent feature of revivalism,
   except in remote and retarded communities, and left no permanent mark
   on any major group. While they lasted they prepared the way for an
   invasion by the Shakers, who won some temporary following. The
   declaration that Christ died for all raised a real theological issue.
   This was what the Methodists were preaching. So also were the "General"
   Baptists, who were distinguished from the "Particular" Baptists by
   their belief in a general atonement. Both kinds of Baptists were
   numerous in Kentucky, and the "Generals" later became a fertile field
   for the Reformers. Within two or three years after Cane Ridge the main
   wave had passed, but the camp meeting remained as a popular pattern of
   religious and social life, though without the more extreme features
   which had made the "great revival" spectacular.

   Richard McNemar, a Presbyterian minister, had not only been a prominent
   figure at the Cane Ridge meeting but had elsewhere cooperated with the
   Methodists, whose type of evangelistic appeal was congenial to him.
   Three months after the meeting a heresy charge against McNemar was
   presented to his presbytery. The process was delayed because so many of
   the "revival men" took his part that those who had filed the charge
   hesitated to bring it to a vote. After various procedures in the
   presbytery, all irregular and indecisive, and after another minister,
   John Thompson, had become involved in the case, the Synod of Kentucky,
   meeting at Lexington, September 6-13, 1803, formally censured the
   presbytery for letting these two men continue to preach while the
   charge of holding "Arminian tenets" (i.e., Methodist doctrines) was
   pending against them.

   As the synod was preparing to put McNemar and Thompson on trial, they
   presented to the synod a document signed by themselves and three
   others, protesting against the trial and withdrawing from the synod's
   jurisdiction. The other three were Barton W. Stone, John Dunlavy, and
   Robert Marshall. After a futile effort to win them back, the synod
   placed the five under suspension.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Springfield Presbytery

   These five men had left the Synod of Kentucky, not the Presbyterian
   Church. Their first act was to organize the Springfield Presbytery,
   independent of the synod. (Their "Springfield" is now Springdale, ten
   miles north of Cincinnati.) Their second act was to issue a statement
   of their position. This is a pamphlet of about 100 pages, the full
   title of which is: An Abstract of an Apology for Renouncing the
   Jurisdiction of the Synod of Kentucky, Being a Compendious View of the
   Gospel and a few Remarks on the Confession of Faith, with the names of
   the five attached as authors. The important points in this statement
   are: (1) Christ died for all--as against a limited atonement for the
   elect only. (2) The gospel itself is the means of regeneration, and
   faith is the act by which any man, if he will, can lay hold on that
   means. (3) Faith is the natural man's belief of testimony--a rational,
   as against a mystical, conception of faith. Nothing is said explicitly
   about either Christian union or the restoration of primitive
   Christianity. (William Guirey, a Virginia Christian minister, later
   sent a copy of this Apology to the New England Christians as expressing
   the sentiments of the Virginia-North Carolina group, and said that the
   Kentucky five "united with us" when they left the Presbyterians.)

   So far, this was an anti-Calvinist movement within the Presbyterian
   Church. Its leaders admitted that their position was not in agreement
   with the Westminster Confession, but claimed the right to differ from
   the Confession where they thought it differed from the Scriptures. The
   whole history of "New Light" Presbyterianism in Virginia and the states
   south of it from colonial days, as well as the recent revival in
   Kentucky, gave them ground for saying: "We are not the only
   Presbyterians who view the doctrine of the atonement different from the
   Confession."

   But the Springfield Presbytery was only a transition stage. These five
   men might make their independent presbytery the nucleus of a new
   Presbyterian body, as the Seceders and others had done in Scotland long
   before, and as the Cumberland Presbyterians were to do a little later;
   or they might cease to be Presbyterians. They chose the latter course.
   On June 28, 1804, less than a year after its organization, the
   Springfield Presbytery met at Cane Ridge and decreed its own
   dissolution. The document in which it recorded this action is called
   "The Last Will and Testament of the Springfield Presbytery." By this
   instrument, the presbytery willed "that this body die, be dissolved and
   sink into union with the Body of Christ at large," that every
   congregation should be independent in the choice and support of its
   minister and the discipline of its members, and that the Bible alone
   should be their guide and standard. Ministers are not to be called
   "Reverend," are to "obtain license from God to preach the simple
   Gospel," and are to be supported by free-will offerings "without a
   written call or subscription." And finally, the Synod of Kentucky is
   exhorted to examine every suspect and suspend every heretic, "that the
   oppressed may go free and taste the sweets of gospel liberty." (The
   full text of the "Last Will and Testament" was reprinted in the first
   issue of Elias Smith's Herald of Gospel Liberty, Portsmouth, N. H.,
   Sept. 1, 1808.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Christian Church

   At this same meeting, June 28, 1804, it was agreed that the name
   "Christian" should be adopted, to the exclusion of all sectarian names.
   This was suggested by Rice Haggard, who had made the same suggestion to
   the O'Kelly group ten years earlier when the Republican Methodists were
   looking for a new name. Haggard had been active as a minister of the
   Christian Church in North Carolina and Virginia from 1794 until his
   removal to Kentucky about the time of the Cane Ridge meeting.

   The "Christians" of Kentucky immediately became a group of churches as
   well as a group of preachers. Fervid evangelists as they were, the
   ministers immediately won to the movement several of the Presbyterian
   churches for which they had preached and organized some new ones. By
   the end of 1804 there were at least thirteen Christian churches in
   north-central Kentucky and about seven more in southwestern Ohio.
   Presbyterians called it the "New Light schism." The number of preachers
   was increased by the adherence of a few revival Presbyterians, by the
   coming of some Christians from the East, and by recognizing as
   preachers a good many men who had little or no formal education.

   Shaker missionaries came to Kentucky in 1805, attracted by reports of
   the marvelous manifestations of the Spirit in the great revival.
   McNemar and Dunlavy soon joined them.

   In the new Christian Church, no question was at first raised about
   baptism. Within a few years, Stone came to the belief that only the
   immersion of believers was scriptural baptism, and this view spread
   gradually through the group. Stone immersed many, including some
   preachers, before he was himself immersed. But it was not made a test
   of fellowship. Twenty years later Stone wrote:

     It was unanimously agreed that every brother and sister should act
     according to their faith; that we should not judge one another for
     being baptized or for not being baptized in this mode. The far
     greater part of the church submitted to be baptized by immersion,
     and now [1827] there is not one in 500 among us who has not been
     immersed. From the commencement we have avoided controversy on this
     subject. (Christian Messenger, Vol. I, p. 267, Oct., 1827.)

   This trend toward immersion existed only in the West. In the East it
   became a divisive issue in 1809, and only a minority adopted it.
   Immersion never became the common practice with the New England
   Christians.

   For some time there was no organization among the Christian churches. A
   "general meeting" of the ministers was held at Bethel, Kentucky, August
   8, 1810, at which they "agreed to unite themselves formally." This
   suggested to some the need of a clearer definition of doctrines,
   especially those of the Trinity, Christ, and the atonement. After
   statements had been drafted and discussed at a later meeting, it was
   agreed by almost all that freedom of theological opinion was better
   than conformity to a standard. Marshall and Thompson, feeling that the
   creedless Christians were too loose in doctrine, returned to the
   Presbyterian Church. This left only Stone, of the original five who had
   seceded from the synod on account of the heresy charges against McNemar
   and Thompson. So it was by survival, rather than by pre-eminence at the
   beginning, that Stone came to be considered the founding father of the
   Christian Church in Kentucky. Later, especially after he began the
   publication of the Christian Messenger in 1826, his leadership is
   evident; and in guiding the greater part of the Christian Church in the
   West into the merger with the Disciples, his influence was probably
   decisive.

   The growth of the western Christian Church was not confined to
   Kentucky. It took root immediately in Tennessee and in southern Ohio
   and Indiana. Traveling evangelists went also into the South. As the
   tide of migration moved to new frontiers, unordained elders,
   farmer-preachers, and sometimes regular ministers carried it to
   Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa. The position of Kentucky, as a breeding
   ground of pioneers who went out in steady streams to aid in laying the
   foundations of these states, made it a strategic point from which a new
   religious movement might make its influence felt throughout the Middle
   West.

   Such was the emphasis upon the independence of local churches and of
   preachers, and so firm the determination to avoid anything like the
   Presbyterian or Methodist systems of centralized control, that
   organization was slow and weak. That meeting in 1810, at which it was
   agreed to "unite formally," did not in fact lead to any formal
   organization. District conferences were arranged. There was a Deer
   Creek (Ohio) Conference as early as 1808, and in the following years
   there were many such. But as late as 1826, Stone felt it necessary to
   defend the practice of holding even district conferences for worship,
   to exchange news of the churches, to arrange appointments so as to
   supply destitute churches, and (a tentative suggestion) "for
   ordination, if thought proper," but emphatically with no authority over
   local churches. In the same year the Wabash (Indiana) Conference agreed
   that it would be well "to have a general conference established in some
   convenient place in the western states," but this was not done. The
   Christian Church in the West had nothing corresponding to what is now
   called "cooperative work," and no agencies or structures through which
   such work could be carried on. The churches of the Northeast had their
   so-called United States Conference, but sometimes they had qualms about
   so much ecclesiasticism. The (New England) general conference of 1832
   voted to dissolve forever, but revived the next year.

   Though there was no inclusive organization, the three main divisions of
   the Christian Church had some acquaintance with one another's work and
   a sense of being parts of one enterprise. The Herald of Gospel Liberty
   circulated widely. Stone had an agent in New York for his Christian
   Messenger. When he reported, in 1828, that "the sect called Christians
   have, in little more than a quarter of a century, risen from nothing to
   1,500 congregations with a membership of 150,000," his
   estimate--doubtless much too large in any case--evidently includes all
   three, and his reference to "more than a quarter of a century" shows
   that he was thinking of beginnings earlier than the dissolution of the
   Springfield Presbytery.

CHAPTER V
THE COMING OF THE CAMPBELLS

   Thomas Campbell, an Argyle Scot by lineage, was born in North Ireland
   in 1763, took a full classical course in the University of Glasgow, and
   after that the full course in the theological seminary of the
   Anti-Burgher section of the Seceder branch of the Scottish Presbyterian
   Church. After preaching and teaching for several years, he became the
   settled pastor of a church at Ahorey, in County Armaugh, thirty miles
   south of Belfast, where he remained from 1798 until 1807. Meanwhile he
   had married the daughter of a French Huguenot family, and his son
   Alexander had been born in 1788. While ministering to the Ahorey
   church, he also conducted a private academy at the neighboring town of
   Rich Hill. Throughout his life, Thomas Campbell devoted more of his
   time to teaching than to preaching.

   The Seceder Presbyterians had split from the established Church of
   Scotland in 1733 in protest against the arrangement by which the right
   of appointing ministers had been taken from the parishes and given to
   lay "patrons," or landlords, for whom the right to appoint the parson
   went with their ownership of land. No question of doctrine was involved
   in this secession. The Seceders were, if anything, stricter Calvinists
   than the Church of Scotland. Later, the Seceders divided into Burghers
   and Anti-Burghers, and each of these into New Lights and Old Lights, on
   fine points concerning the relations of the church to the state. These
   divisions were carried from Scotland to Ireland, though the issues were
   irrelevant to conditions there. Thomas Campbell was an Old Light,
   Anti-Burgher Seceder Presbyterian. But he early outgrew any interest in
   these divisive issues and sought ways of promoting unity at least among
   the Seceders.

   Aside from the odious examples of disunion before his eyes, two other
   influences drew Thomas Campbell toward a wider fellowship. One was the
   Independent (Congregational) church at Rich Hill, a church of the
   Scotch Independent type, strongly affected by the ideas of Glas and
   Sandeman and the Haldane brothers. Here he met the celebrated English
   evangelist, Rowland Hill, who preached an ardent gospel that took
   little account of sectarian boundaries, and the eccentric John Walker
   of Dublin, who left the Episcopal Church and resigned a fellowship in
   Trinity College to lead an independent movement. Campbell was already
   familiar with the writings of Glas and Sandeman and with the work of
   the Haldanes. None of these was explicitly an advocate of union; but
   they all played down the doctrines and creeds which create divisions
   and the ecclesiastical institutions which perpetuate them; and all
   played up a warm evangelical faith voluntarily accepted and a return to
   the simple practices of the New Testament church.

   The second influence which moved Mr. Campbell toward a nonsectarian
   view of religion was the writings of the philosopher, John Locke,
   especially his Letters Concerning Toleration. In these essays Locke had
   urged toleration, not only by the state toward dissenting groups, but
   also by the church toward varieties of theological opinion within
   itself. Sentences could be quoted from Locke which sound as though they
   came straight from the Declaration and Address. All this rested on a
   philosophy carefully worked out in his Essay on the Human
   Understanding. Thomas Campbell diligently studied these two books by
   John Locke and made them required reading for his son Alexander, who
   never ceased to give them his unbounded admiration.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Seceding from the Seceders

   Partly because of ill health in his forties (he lived to the age of
   ninety-one), and partly to find a place of ampler opportunity for his
   seven children, Thomas Campbell migrated to America in 1807, as many of
   his Ulster neighbors had done before him. He landed at Philadelphia on
   May 13, fortunately found the Associate Synod of North America, which
   represented all the Seceders in America, in session in that city,
   presented his credentials and was received into the synod on May 16,
   and two days later was appointed to the Presbytery of Chartiers in
   southwestern Pennsylvania. The minutes of the presbytery show that he
   had preaching appointments at "Buffaloe" (now Bethany, W. Va.),
   Pittsburgh, and other points beginning July 1. So, in less than three
   months after preaching his farewell sermon in the Ahorey church in
   Ireland, Thomas Campbell was ministering to a circuit of communities on
   the American frontier.

   But the connection so promptly made was not long peacefully maintained.
   At the October meeting of the presbytery, another minister filed
   charges against him for heretical teaching and disorderly procedure,
   and others testified unfavorably. After several confused and stormy
   sessions, the presbytery suspended Mr. Campbell. He appealed to the
   synod in Philadelphia at its meeting the next year. There were extended
   and complicated proceedings, culminating in a formal trial in which he
   was found guilty on several counts, and was sentenced to be "rebuked
   and admonished." At the same time the synod censured the presbytery for
   its irregular and unfair handling of the case. Evidently the synod did
   not think too badly of Mr. Campbell, for it gave him appointments with
   the Philadelphia churches for the summer and then sent him back to
   resume his preaching in the Presbytery of Chartiers. But the
   presbytery, smarting under the synod's censure and the reversal of its
   act of suspension, gave him a chilly reception. Specifically, it failed
   to give him any preaching appointments, and a rule of the church
   forbade a preacher to make his own. Tensions and animosities developed
   until, on September 13, 1808, Thomas Campbell orally--and the next day
   in writing--renounced the authority of both presbytery and synod. From
   that act, severing his connection with the Seceder Presbyterians,
   Thomas Campbell never receded. But the presbytery continued to summon
   him to appear and answer charges until, a year and a half later, it
   gave him up as hopeless and voted to depose him "from the holy ministry
   and from the sealing ordinances."

   What were the reasons for this break? Richardson, in his Memoirs of
   Alexander Campbell, says that Thomas Campbell gave offense first by
   inviting Presbyterians other than Seceders to participate in the
   communion service. This does not appear among the written charges in
   the minutes of either the presbytery or the synod, but it may well be
   true. He is quoted as saying that the test of fitness to commune should
   be only a "general," not a "particular," acceptance of the Westminster
   Confession, and that he himself would gladly commune with other
   Christians, Lutherans, for example, if a church of his own order were
   not available. Moreover, he admitted advising Seceders to attend the
   preaching services of other churches if none of their own was at hand.

   The heart of the difficulty was that he said that "the church has no
   divine warrant for holding Confessions of Faith as terms of communion";
   creeds may be useful for teaching, but they should not be used as tests
   of fellowship, because they contain some things that cannot be proved
   by the Bible and many things that ordinary people cannot understand.
   The only strictly theological point related to the nature of "saving
   faith," which, in Mr. Campbell's view, did not necessarily include a
   sense of "assurance that we in particular shall be saved." He had
   already moved far toward the conception of faith as the rational belief
   of testimony about Christ and trust in him, rather than a mystical
   experience evidencing a special act of divine grace in favor of the
   individual to assure him that he had been accepted by God. Two other
   complaints show that Mr. Campbell had been restless under the
   restraints of the Presbyterian system. He had preached, on invitation
   from the people, within the parish or circuit of another minister
   without getting his consent. And he had said that, in the absence of a
   minister, "ruling elders" (who would be laymen) might properly pray and
   exhort in public worship.

   At this stage, then, it appears from the record that Thomas Campbell
   did not radically reject either the Calvinistic theology as a system of
   doctrine or the Presbyterian polity as a system of church government,
   though he was far on the way toward rejecting both. His divergence from
   the Seceder Presbyterians can be summed up under these points: (1) He
   wanted closer relations with Christians of other denominations. (2) He
   did not regard the creed as the standard of truth or as an
   authoritative compendium of the truths revealed in Scripture, but
   claimed for himself and for every Christian the right to be judged and
   to test the creed by reference to the plain teachings of the Bible. (3)
   He held that acceptance of the creed in detail should not be a
   condition of communion or fellowship. (4) He was suspicious of clerical
   monopoly. (5) He said that a feeling of assurance of salvation was not
   of the essence of saving faith, though it might accompany a high degree
   of such faith. (6) He held that Christ died for all men, and that any
   man could believe on him and be saved. This last point was his most
   definite departure from Calvinism.

   If the presbytery gave Campbell no preaching appointments after the
   synod had sent him back "rebuked and admonished," naturally it gave him
   none after he had renounced its authority. But he continued to preach
   in private houses as opportunity offered. None of the churches for
   which he had preached followed him, and no Presbyterian ministers
   joined him in withdrawing from the Presbytery of Chartiers. In those
   respects his movement differed in its beginning from that of O'Kelly
   and from that of McNemar and Stone. But in both of the earlier
   secessions the separatists had been preaching in their districts for
   years, and the ground had been plowed by revivals, and in Kentucky the
   way had been prepared by the immigration of many "Christian" ministers
   and laymen from the East. Thomas Campbell, on the other hand, was a
   newcomer from Ireland and made the break in a community where there had
   been no such preparation and where he had no wide acquaintance.

   Before the final action expelling Mr. Campbell from the Seceder
   Presbyterian ministry, a group of his sympathizers and habitual
   hearers, meeting at the home of Abraham Altars, between Mount Pleasant
   and Washington, Pennsylvania, resolved to form a society "to give more
   definiteness to the movement in which they had thus far been
   cooperating without any formal organization or definite arrangement."
   The result was the "Christian Association of Washington," organized
   August 17, 1809. It was agreed that a proper motto would be, "Where the
   Scriptures speak, we speak; where the Scriptures are silent, we are
   silent." One member protested that this would lead to giving up infant
   baptism. The others thought not, but considered it a sound principle
   wherever it might lead. To express more fully the motives and purposes
   of the association, Thomas Campbell drew up a Declaration and Address,
   which was presented at a subsequent meeting as the report of a
   committee of twenty-one. (The total membership was not much more.) On
   September 7, 1809, the association approved it and ordered it printed.

   It was exactly at this point that Alexander Campbell arrived from
   Ireland by way of Scotland.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Alexander Campbell at Glasgow

   When Thomas Campbell came to America, he left his family in Ireland.
   Alexander, then nineteen years old, was to conduct his father's school
   at Rich Hill until the end of the term and to bring his mother and the
   six younger children to America when his father gave the word. The word
   came when Thomas Campbell had been in America about fifteen months. On
   October 1, 1808, the family embarked at Londonderry. Their ship ran
   aground on one of the rocky islands of the Hebrides. During that
   experience, Alexander's previous thought about devoting himself to the
   ministry reached the point of a firm decision. The interruption of the
   voyage so late in the sailing season made it necessary to wait until
   spring for its continuance. The shipwrecked travelers made their way to
   Glasgow, where they remained almost an entire year.

   This year in Glasgow proved to be very important. It gave Alexander
   opportunity to supplement the excellent instruction he had received
   from his father by a year of study in the University of Glasgow. In
   addition, it brought him into contact with the men from whom, as his
   biographer, Richardson, says, he derived "his first impulse as a
   religious reformer." These were representatives of the movement led and
   financed by the brothers Robert and James Alexander Haldane.

   Alexander Campbell came to Glasgow with a letter of introduction to Mr.
   Greville Ewing, who was in charge of the seminary, or training school
   for lay preachers, which the Haldanes had established in that city. Mr.
   Ewing became his closest and most helpful friend during that year in
   Glasgow. Ewing had introduced into his seminary the books of Glas and
   Sandeman, whose teachings gave the strongest possible emphasis to the
   restoration of primitive Christianity in all details. In Ewing's
   conversation and Glas's and Sandeman's books, Alexander Campbell found
   not only the general concept of a needed restoration of primitive
   Christianity but such specific ideas as these: the independence of the
   local congregation; weekly observance of the Lord's Supper; a plurality
   of elders; the denial of clerical privileges and dignities; the right
   and duty of laymen to have a part in the edification and discipline of
   the church; and a conception of faith as such a belief of testimony as
   any man is capable of by the application of his natural intelligence to
   the facts supplied by Scripture. The Haldanes themselves, and some of
   the followers of Sandeman, had adopted immersion, but Ewing adhered to
   infant baptism and sprinkling.

   The action of all these influences upon Alexander Campbell's mind, and
   of his mind upon what he saw and learned of Presbyterianism in
   Scotland, brought him to a profound dissatisfaction with it. He had no
   quarrel with its theology. Near the end of his year in Glasgow, when he
   was examined by the Seceder church to determine his fitness to partake
   of the communion--because he brought no credentials, and the Seceders
   were very careful to permit no unqualified person to commune--no fault
   was found with his profession of faith, and he received the "token"
   which would admit him to the table. But at the communion service, after
   postponing his decision to the last possible moment, he laid down his
   token and walked out. This was, in effect, his break with the Seceder
   Presbyterian Church. He never went back.

   Alexander Campbell and the family sailed for America early in August,
   1809, landed at New York on September 29, and proceeded to Philadelphia
   by stage-coach and thence westward by wagon. Word had been sent ahead
   to Thomas Campbell, and he met them on the road in western
   Pennsylvania, October 19, with a copy of the freshly printed
   Declaration and Address in his pocket. Father and son, with an ocean
   between them, had independently broken with their religious past and
   moved by converging paths toward the same goal. Alexander read the
   Declaration and Address and was enthusiastic about it. It marshaled him
   the way that he was going.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The "Declaration and Address"

   The Declaration and Address is one of the most important documents in
   the history of the Disciples. It deserves not only reading in full but
   careful study. As published in a later edition, it is a pamphlet of
   fifty-six pages containing four parts: first, a Declaration (3 pages)
   stating briefly the plans and purposes of the Christian Association of
   Washington; second, an Address (18 pages), signed by Thomas Campbell
   and Thomas Acheson, giving an extended argument for the unity of all
   Christians and amplifying the principles on which the church can regain
   its original unity and purity; third, an Appendix (31 pages) explaining
   several points in the Address; fourth, a Postscript (3 pages), written
   three months later, suggesting steps to be taken for the promotion of
   the movement.

   The Declaration states the aim and the means of attaining it. The aim:
   "unity, peace, and purity." The means: "rejecting human opinions, ...
   returning to, and holding fast by, the original standard." The method
   of procedure is outlined under nine heads:

     1. The formation of a religious association "for the sole purpose of
     promoting simple evangelical Christianity, free from all mixture of
     human opinions and inventions of men."

     2. Contributions "to support a pure Gospel Ministry, that shall
     reduce to practice that whole form of doctrine, worship, discipline,
     and government, expressly revealed and enjoined in the word of God."

     3. The formation of similar societies.

     4. The Christian Association of Washington is not a church, but an
     organization of "voluntary advocates for church reformation."

     5. The association will support only such ministers as conform to
     "the original standard."

     6. A committee of twenty-one, chosen annually, shall transact the
     business of the association.

     7. Meetings shall be held twice a year.

     8. An order of business for the meetings.

     9. The association agrees to support those ministers whom it shall
     invite to assist "in promoting a pure evangelical reformation, by
     the simple preaching of the everlasting gospel, and the
     administration of its ordinances in an exact conformity to the
     Divine Standard."

   The Address opens, and for many pages continues, with a picture of the
   "awful and distressing effects" of division among Christians, an
   impassioned plea for unity, an argument that conditions in America are
   uniquely favorable for a union effort, and a restatement of the causes
   of division and the basis of union. Mr. Campbell revealed the central
   principle of his endeavor, the ground of his hope for its success, and
   the breadth of his tolerance, when he wrote:

     It is, to us, a pleasing consideration that all the churches of
     Christ, which mutually acknowledge each other as such, are not only
     agreed in the great doctrines of faith and holiness; but are also
     materially agreed, as to the positive ordinances of Gospel
     institution; so that our differences, at most, are about the things
     in which the kingdom of God does not consist, that is, about matters
     of private opinion, or human invention.

   The Address then lays down thirteen numbered propositions, which, in
   condensed form, are as follows:

     1. "The church of Christ upon earth is essentially, intentionally,
     and constitutionally one."

     2. Congregations locally separate ought to be in fellowship with one
     another.

     3. Nothing ought to be an article of faith, a term of communion, or
     a rule for the constitution and management of the church except what
     is expressly taught by Christ and his apostles.

     4. "The New Testament is as perfect a constitution for the worship,
     discipline and government of the New Testament church, and as
     perfect a rule for the particular duties of its members; as the Old
     Testament was ... for ... the Old Testament Church."

     5. The church can give no new commandments where the Scriptures are
     silent.

     6. Inferences and deductions from Scripture may be true doctrine,
     but they are not binding on the consciences of Christians further
     than they perceive them to be so.

     7. Creeds may be useful for instruction but must not be used as
     tests of fitness for membership in the church.

     8. Full knowledge of all revealed truth is not necessary to entitle
     persons to membership, "neither should they, for this purpose, be
     required to make a profession more extensive than their knowledge."
     Realization of their need of salvation, faith in Christ as Savior,
     and obedience to him are all that is necessary.

     9. All who are thus qualified should love each other as brothers and
     be united.

     10. "Division among christians is a horrid evil."

     11. Divisions have been caused, in some cases, by neglect of the
     expressly revealed will of God; in others, by assuming authority to
     make human opinions the test of fellowship or to introduce human
     inventions into the faith and practice of the church.

     12. All that is needed for the purity and perfection of the church
     is that it receive those, and only those, who profess faith in
     Christ and obey him according to the Scriptures, that it retain them
     only so long as their conduct is in accord with their profession,
     that ministers teach only what is expressly revealed, and that all
     divine ordinances be observed as the New Testament church observed
     them.

     13. When the church adopts necessary "expedients," they should be
     recognized for what they are and should not be confused with divine
     commands, so that they will give no occasion for division.

   The Appendix explains and clarifies several points in the foregoing and
   answers possible objections.

   The Postscript, written after the committee of twenty-one had held its
   first monthly meeting, December 14, 1809, makes two suggestions. The
   first is that there be prepared "a catechetical exhibition of the
   fulness and precision of the holy scriptures upon the entire subject of
   christianity--an exhibition of that complete system of faith and duty
   expressly contained in the sacred oracles; respecting the doctrine,
   worship, discipline, and government of the christian church."
   Fortunately, this was never done. The second suggestion is that a
   monthly magazine be published, to be called the Christian Monitor, to
   be started when 500 subscribers were secured, and to be devoted to
   "detecting and exposing the various anti-christian enormities,
   innovations and corruptions, which infect the christian church." This
   project also was dropped, and it was not until thirteen years later,
   and in the hands of Alexander Campbell, that the Christian Baptist took
   the assignment of "detecting and exposing."

   At this distance in time it is not easy to see how the author and
   signers of the Declaration and Address could suppose that they would be
   able to "reduce to practice that whole form of doctrine, worship,
   discipline, and government, expressly revealed" without employing any
   opinions of their own in interpreting the revelation, when they clearly
   saw that those who had attempted this before them had produced
   discordant and divisive systems. They were sounding their prophetic and
   unifying note when they declared, in the same document, that the basis
   of fellowship is not agreement on any complete system of doctrine and
   church practice, but is the simple and saving essentials of the gospel
   upon which Christians generally are already agreed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Brush Run Church

   Alexander Campbell, newly arrived on the scene of this nascent
   reformation, immediately settled down to a strenuous course of private
   study--Bible, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and church history. He preached his
   first sermon on July 15, 1810, in a private house. He had no license to
   preach and he was a member of no church, for he had left his
   Presbyterianism in Scotland, and the Christian Association of
   Washington was not yet a church. He preached a hundred times during the
   next twelve months.

   After Thomas Campbell had applied for admission to the regular (not
   Seceder) Presbyterian Synod of Pittsburgh, and had been rejected, the
   Christian Association of Washington constituted itself a church, on May
   4, 1811. This became the first church among Disciples of Christ in the
   Campbell strain of their lineage. The new church chose Thomas Campbell
   as elder, elected four deacons, and licensed Alexander Campbell to
   preach. It observed the Lord's Supper the next day, and thereafter
   every Lord's day. A simple building was erected--the Brush Run
   Church--and the first service was held in it on June 16, 1811.
   Alexander Campbell was ordained on the first day of the next January.

   The subject of baptism had not yet been seriously considered. Some
   members of the group, and some of its critics, doubted whether the
   principles of the Declaration and Address were consistent with infant
   baptism and sprinkling. Thomas Campbell was not disturbed about it.
   Stating his views to the Synod of Pittsburgh, he had said that infant
   baptism is not a command of Christ, hence not a condition of membership
   in the church, but that it is a matter of forbearance. Three members of
   the Brush Run Church, soon after its organization, refused to commune
   because they had not been baptized. These had not even been sprinkled,
   yet they had been admitted to membership. "Forbearance" had extended so
   far. At their urgent request, Thomas Campbell immersed them--somewhat
   reluctantly, it may be surmised, for he did it without going into the
   water himself. At that time Alexander Campbell said: "As I am sure it
   is unscriptural to make this matter [baptism] a term of communion, I
   let it slip. I wish to think and let think on these matters."

   Almost a year later, the birth of his first child forced the question
   of infant baptism upon his attention and drove him to a study of the
   whole subject. The result was the conviction that the sprinkling of
   infants was not baptism within the meaning of the New Testament. On
   June 12, 1812, Thomas and Alexander Campbell, their wives, and three
   other members of the church were immersed in Buffalo Creek by a Baptist
   preacher, on a simple confession of faith in Christ. Most of the
   members of the Brush Run Church soon followed this example. Those who
   did not, withdrew.

   The adoption of immersion in this way, as the unvarying practice of the
   church and therefore as an item in the proposed platform for the union
   of all churches, radically changed the program of the movement. It had
   begun with the idea that the churches were divided by human opinions
   that had been added to a perfectly adequate common core of revealed
   truth and duty which all accepted. But now the Reformers could no
   longer say, as Thomas Campbell had said, that all the churches "are
   agreed in the great doctrines of faith and holiness and as to the
   positive ordinances of the Gospel institution." To achieve union no
   longer required only persuading the churches to unite upon something
   that they already held. Now, it became necessary to persuade them also
   to accept one "positive ordinance" which only the Baptists believed to
   be commanded in the New Testament.

   But if the adoption of immersion erected a barrier between the
   Reformers and the other churches, it brought them closer to the
   Baptists. In the autumn of 1813 the Brush Run Church applied for
   admission to the Redstone Baptist Association, at the same time
   submitting a full written statement of its position, including its
   protest against creeds. The application was accepted, over the protest
   of some of the Baptist ministers. For the next seventeen years, the
   Reformers were, as Walter Scott said, "in the bosom of the Regular
   Baptist churches." But they did not lose their sense of mission or
   merge indistinguishably in the Baptist denomination.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI
WITH THE BAPTISTS, 1813-30

   After the Brush Run Church had joined the Redstone Baptist Association,
   Alexander Campbell began to preach more widely among the Baptist
   churches of the region. Thomas Campbell, who was more occupied with
   teaching than with preaching, rather rapidly dropped out of his
   position of leadership, which was taken over by his son. Alexander had
   married the daughter of a well-to-do farmer, and his father-in-law had
   deeded to him the farm which was to be the nucleus of his large Bethany
   estate, part of which became the campus of Bethany College thirty years
   later. Even at the age of twenty-five he enjoyed economic security and
   was well on the way toward becoming a substantial citizen.

   At a meeting of the Redstone Baptist Association in August, 1816,
   Alexander Campbell preached his famous "Sermon on the Law." There seems
   to have been some scheming to keep him off the program, and he was
   called in only at the last moment to fill a vacancy. But the content of
   the sermon, if not its form, had evidently been the subject of long and
   careful study. The central point of it was that the Christian system is
   not a continuation of the Jewish regime but is based on a new covenant
   which, though prepared for and prophesied in the religion of the Old
   Testament, is a radically new thing. Therefore, he said, no arguments
   can be drawn from the Old Testament about the nature or form of
   Christian institutions. The law of the Sabbath has nothing to do with
   the observance of the first day of the week; baptism cannot be
   understood by considering it as taking the place of circumcision;
   paying tithes and keeping fasts are no part of a Christian's duty; and
   any alliance between church and state, as in the old covenant of God
   with the Hebrews, is alien to the spirit and nature of Christianity.

   Some of these conclusions--especially separation of church and state
   and the denial of any analogy between baptism and circumcision--were
   pleasing to the Baptist audience. But the basis of the argument, the
   complete abrogation of the Old Testament law, seemed to many a
   dangerous doctrine. The preachers who heard the sermon went out to
   spread among the churches their fears that this bold and brilliant
   young man might be a disturber of Baptist usage. Thereafter he
   "itinerated less" among the Baptist churches and confined his labors to
   "three or four little communities constituted on the Bible, one in
   Ohio, one in Virginia and two in Pennsylvania." But he also made one or
   two preaching trips a year among the regular Baptists. He opened in
   1818, and conducted for four years, a boarding school for boys,
   especially with a view to finding and training candidates for the
   ministry.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Debates on Baptism

   Mr. Campbell's Baptist colleagues may have considered him heretical
   about the covenants, but they could not fail to value him as a champion
   of immersion. So when a Seceder Presbyterian minister, John Walker of
   Mt. Pleasant, Ohio, issued a challenge for a debate on that topic, they
   urged him to accept it. Mr. Walker, as challenger, affirmed that the
   infant children of believers are proper subjects for baptism and that
   sprinkling is a proper mode. As to the baptism of infants, he rested
   his case almost wholly on the proposition "that baptism came in the
   room of circumcision, that the covenant on which the Jewish church was
   built and to which circumcision is the seal, is the same with the
   covenant on which the Christian church is built and to which Baptism is
   the seal." This is precisely the proposition that Mr. Campbell had
   denied in his "Sermon on the Law," and it gave him opportunity to
   elaborate and reinforce his argument as to the radical newness of
   Christianity and its freedom from Old Testament law. In addition, he
   made use of his careful studies of the Greek word baptizein and the
   prepositions used with it in the passages describing baptism. He quoted
   pedobaptist lexicographers and commentators to prove that the Greek
   verb means "to immerse"; and he stressed the distinction between
   "positive" and "moral" precepts to show that the former, including
   baptism, demand implicit obedience with no reasoning on our part as to
   the expediency or value of the thing commanded.

   The debate with Walker was held at Mt. Pleasant, Ohio, in June, 1820.
   It greatly enhanced Campbell's reputation, especially among the
   Baptists of the Mahoning Association in eastern Ohio, and brought him
   many invitations to preach in the churches of this association. The
   publication of the debate as a book gave much wider publicity to his
   ideas and brought on another debate, in October, 1823, with W. L.
   Maccalla, a Presbyterian minister of Augusta, Kentucky. This debate was
   held at Washington, Mason County, Kentucky. On the horseback trip from
   his home to that place, Mr. Campbell was accompanied by Sidney Rigdon,
   then a young Baptist minister in Pittsburgh, later one of the three who
   constituted the "first presidency" of the Mormon Church and still later
   a rival of Brigham Young for its leadership after the death of the
   "prophet" Joseph Smith. The text of Campbell's side of the discussion,
   as subsequently published, is based on Rigdon's report.

   In the Maccalla debate, Campbell began to develop his theory of the
   design of baptism. Baptism is appropriate for penitent believers, not
   for innocent infants, because it is the "washing of regeneration,"
   designed to cleanse, not from inherited original sin, but from the
   guilt of actual personal sins. Yet it is not a magical "water
   salvation," though he was often accused of teaching that. "The blood of
   Christ really cleanses us who believe.... The water of baptism formally
   washes away our sins." This distinction was never again so clearly
   stated, and it may be argued that it represents a stage through which
   Mr. Campbell's thought passed, rather than a conclusion on which it
   rested. However, it brought into prominence the conception of "baptism
   for the remission of sins." When the distinction between "real" and
   "formal" remission was dropped, other ways were found for avoiding the
   morally repugnant conclusion that, if remission comes by baptism and
   only immersion is baptism, then the unimmersed must necessarily be
   damned. Neither Campbell nor the Disciples after him ever believed
   that.

   The journey to Kentucky to meet Maccalla was the first of Alexander
   Campbell's many visits to Kentucky. It put him in touch with men and
   churches that were going his way--the "Christians," and a strain among
   the Baptists that was to furnish powerful reinforcement to his cause.
   And on that long journey by horseback he carried in his saddlebags
   copies of the first issue of his new magazine, the Christian Baptist.
     __________________________________________________________________

  "Reforming Baptists"

   The Christian Baptist began in 1823 and continued for seven years. Mr.
   Campbell was his own publisher. He set up a printing office on his
   farm, secured the location of the post office of Buffaloe (later
   Bethany), and was appointed postmaster. The magazine took up at once
   the delayed task of "detecting and exposing the various anti-christian
   enormities, innovations and corruptions which infect the christian
   church." It was small, as a hornet is small, and its sting was as keen.
   It attacked especially three characteristics of the existing churches:
   the authority and status assumed by the clergy; unscriptural
   organizations, such as synods and church courts, missionary societies,
   Bible societies, Sunday schools, and all kinds of "innovations" and
   "popular schemes"; and the use of creeds. There was loud outcry that it
   sowed the seeds of discord among the churches. It certainly did. Mr.
   Campbell would have said that there must always be discord when truth
   is boldly proclaimed and error is stubbornly held.

   On the constructive side, the magazine used much space in
   developing--as the Postscript had suggested doing in a catechism--"that
   complete system of faith and duty expressly contained in the Sacred
   Oracles respecting the doctrine, worship and government of the church."
   A few years later it was said that Mr. Campbell now became the advocate
   of "a particular ecclesiastical order." To him it was the order of the
   apostolic church. For a time, little attention was paid to Christian
   unity. This objective was not forgotten, but it was held that emphasis
   should be first upon the pattern and procedure of the primitive church
   as the only ground upon which Christians could unite.

   All this produced an upheaval among the Baptist churches within the
   area of Mr. Campbell's personal and journalistic influence--and it was
   a considerable area. Since the Redstone Association, to which the Brush
   Run Church belonged, for the most part resisted his ideas in their
   earlier statement, he had formed a new Baptist church in the town which
   is now Wellsburg, on the Ohio River, seven miles from Bethany, and
   secured its admission into the Mahoning Association of eastern Ohio.
   But in 1826, ten Redstone churches that stood firm for the Philadelphia
   Confession and Baptist usages cut off thirteen that leaned toward the
   Reformers, and the thirteen joined the Washington (Pa.) Association,
   thereby overbalancing it in the same direction. The Mahoning
   Association became thoroughly permeated by the idea of restoring
   primitive practice. The church at Hiram, for example, abandoned its
   church covenant, constitution, and Confession of Faith to adopt "the
   Bible alone" as its standard; and all the others were following fast in
   the same way. Many Baptist churches in western Pennsylvania and
   Virginia contained large minorities, if not actual majorities,
   favorable to the "restoration" program. One can understand the distress
   of Rev. Robert Semple, who, speaking as one quite satisfied with the
   Baptist position, said that the Christian Baptist was "more mischievous
   than any publication I have ever known."

   The ferment in Kentucky was even more acute. For more than twenty years
   the Baptists in that state, while gaining rapidly in numbers, had been
   troubled by dissension concerning some of their Calvinistic doctrines
   and questions growing out of them--election, whether Christ died for
   all; the nature of faith, whether saving faith requires a special
   enabling act by the Holy Spirit for each individual; and the kind of
   "experience" a converted man ought to have. Some associations had
   divided on one or more of these issues. Camp-meeting methods, developed
   in and after the "great revival," offended some by their disorderly
   enthusiasm, gratified others by their offer of salvation to all. The
   "Christian" churches, which provided a continuing series of revivals
   with Methodistic coloration, attracted those who wanted freedom both
   from the rigid theology of the old creeds and from the Methodist and
   Presbyterian systems of centralized control over ministers and local
   churches.

   Stirred by these influences, many Kentucky Baptists were ready for a
   call to follow a "reformer." The Christian Baptist, the Maccalla debate
   in 1823, and Mr. Campbell's extensive tour through Kentucky the next
   year furnished the call.

   One of its most eager and receptive hearers was "Raccoon" John Smith.
   He was a frontiersman with little formal education but with a keen
   mind, a free spirit, and a passion for preaching the gospel. In 1824,
   when he met Campbell, he was forty years old (four years older than
   Campbell) and had been an ordained Baptist minister for sixteen years.
   Within the next year he began to preach in the way of the
   Reformers--the gospel for all, a simple faith in Christ such as is
   common to all sects, no creed, every man able to believe and repent, no
   miraculous "experience" needed. Charges of un-Baptistic teaching were
   brought against him at an annual meeting of the North District
   Association and were to be acted upon the next year. Meanwhile he went
   forth to evangelize and before the next meeting of the association he
   had won so many converts and organized so many new churches "on the
   Bible alone" that the charges had to be dropped. In April, 1830, this
   association formally adopted the principles of the Reformers, but did
   not at that time dissolve. Within the year, three or four other Baptist
   associations had taken similar action. At the same time, through the
   work of other Baptist preachers who cast in their lot with the new
   movement, many new independent churches had been formed, and some old
   churches had dropped the Baptist name. As early as 1825 the Baptist
   church in Louisville, of which P. S. Fall was pastor, voted to give up
   the Philadelphia Confession and take the Bible alone. Jacob Creath,
   Sr., and Jacob Creath, Jr., and John Smith evangelized so widely and so
   successfully that the new movement gathered a considerable following
   from the previously unconverted as well as from the Baptist churches.
   By the end of 1830, the Reformers--"Campbellites" to their
   opponents--were a clearly recognizable element in Kentucky, though most
   of them were still nominally Baptists.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Walter Scott, the "Gospel Restored"

   But the events which were most decisive in changing the Reformers from
   "Reforming Baptists" to an independent group to be known as Disciples
   occurred in the Mahoning Association in eastern Ohio. The man who had
   most to do with these events was Walter Scott. Born in Edinburgh in
   1796 and educated in the university of that city, Scott was still a
   member of the Church of Scotland when he came to New York immediately
   after his graduation and to Pittsburgh the next year. Here he taught in
   a school conducted by a Mr. Forrester, who was also the leader of a
   church of immersed Haldaneans--locally known as "kissing Baptists."
   Scott joined this church. To gain a better understanding of the
   restoration of primitive practices, he visited similar churches in New
   York, Paterson, New Jersey, Baltimore, and Washington. He found that
   they did not entirely agree as to just what the practice of the
   primitive church was. He returned to Pittsburgh much depressed, but
   resumed his teaching and studied the writings of Locke, Glas, Sandeman,
   and Haldane to clarify his religious ideas. The sudden death of Mr.
   Forrester threw upon him the care of the little church. His first
   meeting with Mr. Campbell, his senior by eight years, was at Pittsburgh
   in the winter of 1821-22. They met occasionally during the next year,
   and the contact brought Scott out of his fog. When Campbell was
   planning his magazine, it was Scott who suggested the name, "Christian
   Baptist," as an indication that the aim was to work with and through
   the Baptists, not to promote a defection from them.

   Scott's chief interest was in defining the process by which one becomes
   a Christian. That had really been the central point in Thomas
   Campbell's original concern, for this, in his view, would define the
   terms of fellowship and become the basis of union. But attention had
   been diverted to developing a complete pattern for the restoration of
   the church on the primitive model. To the first four issues of the
   Christian Baptist, Scott contributed a series of articles on "A
   Divinely Authorized Plan of Preaching the Christian Religion." The plan
   of preaching it and the plan of accepting it must naturally be the
   same. There must be the right elements in the right order. He found
   that the exact steps, authoritatively given as constituting the way to
   salvation, were these: (1) Faith, the persuasion of the mind by
   rational evidence. "The messiahship rests on demonstration," and
   everything else follows from that on authority. (2) Repentance of sins,
   under the motive of the promises. (3) Baptism, in obedience to divine
   command. (4) Remission of sins, and (5) the gift of the Holy Spirit,
   both in fulfillment of God's promise, which is conditioned on man's
   completion of the first three steps.

   These became the five points of Scott's standard sermon and the outline
   of a tremendously effective evangelistic appeal. These points were all
   implicit in what Campbell was teaching, but so long as they remained
   implicit they could not win converts; they could only change some
   regular Baptists into Reforming Baptists, and divide Baptist churches
   and associations. The Mahoning Association was more thoroughly imbued
   with Campbell's views than any other; yet at its annual meeting in 1827
   all its churches together (excepting Campbell's own church at
   Wellsburg, which did a little better) reported only twenty-one
   additions for the year--and there had been twelve excommunications. It
   was agreed to appoint an evangelist to "travel and teach among the
   churches." Scott, who had moved to Steubenville, Ohio, within the
   boundaries of the association, and who had visited its meetings twice
   at Campbell's invitation and preached before it once, was asked to
   accept this appointment. He was not a member of the association, not a
   Baptist, not an ordained minister. With the Mahoning Association in
   1827, evidently being a Reformer counted for more than being a Baptist.

   It was a good appointment. Scott began his work at New Lisbon, Ohio.
   The first convert under his new presentation of the "ancient gospel"
   was William Amend, who, according to Scott's biographer, Baxter, "was
   beyond all question the first person in modern times who received the
   ordinance of baptism in perfect accordance with apostolic teaching and
   usage." That was on November 18, 1827. The force and freshness of
   Scott's appeal, the exciting sense of discovery, the thought that an
   ancient treasure of divine truth was just now being brought to light
   after being lost for centuries, the sense of witnessing the dawn of a
   new epoch in the history of Christianity--these things gave to the
   campaign an extraordinary quality. It was different from other
   revivals. Here was no debauch of emotion, but an attractive blending of
   rationality and authority. It appealed to common sense as well as to
   Scripture. It assumed man's rational ability to understand what he
   ought to do and why, and his moral ability to do it. The first three
   steps were man's; the other two were God's. When the convert had
   believed, repented, and obeyed (i.e., been baptized), he could be
   perfectly sure that he would be saved by the remission of his sins and
   the gift of the Holy Spirit and eternal life. He had the promise of God
   for it.

   Scott's work extended throughout eastern Ohio. Besides completing the
   conquest of the Mahoning Association for the Reform, it gained great
   numbers of converts--many from other denominations but many also,
   probably more, who had been members of no church. New churches were
   organized. Some of the Baptist preachers entered vigorously into the
   new movement, and some of the new converts--such as William Hayden, A.
   S. Hayden, and John Henry--became preachers of great power. The first
   year of this new evangelism brought more than 1,000 additions to the
   churches of the Mahoning Association, more than doubling their total
   membership. Scott was assisted at times by Joseph Gaston, a "Christian"
   preacher who was, Scott says, the first of that church who "received
   the gospel after its restoration." At the 1828 meeting of the
   association, William Hayden was added to the staff, and the next year
   Bentley and Bosworth.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Separation from the Baptists

   In three years, the Mahoning Association had lost every distinctive
   Baptist characteristic except its form and name as a Baptist
   association. Scott's rigid devotion to the idea of reproducing the
   practice of the primitive church led him to the conviction that there
   was no warrant for associations. He suggested that the association be
   dissolved and persuaded Mr. Campbell not to oppose this action, as he
   was inclined to do. A resolution to that effect was passed.

   The actual separation of the Reformers--hereafter to be called
   Disciples--from the Baptists was a process which had begun two or three
   years earlier and which continued for at least three years after this
   event. But if a single date must be set for the beginning of the
   Disciples of Christ as a separate and independent religious body, it is
   in August, 1830, with the dissolution of the Mahoning Association at
   Austintown, Ohio.

   The doctrines and practices of the Disciples which distinguished them
   from the Baptists at the time of the separation may be summarized:

   As to doctrine: (1) The distinction between the old and new covenants,
   with consequent reliance solely upon the New Testament as a source for
   instruction concerning Christian faith and institutions. (2) The design
   of baptism, for remission of sins; faith, repentance, and baptism
   constitute regeneration. (3) The nature of faith as the belief of
   testimony, a rational act of which any man is capable in the exercise
   of his natural powers and free will. (4) The operation of the Holy
   Spirit through the Word alone in conversion. (5) Rejection of the
   Calvinistic idea (which not all Baptists held) that Christ died for
   only the "elect," a limited number of predetermined individuals.

   As to practice: (1) Rejection of creeds and church covenants. (2)
   Reception of members on confession of faith in Christ, repentance, and
   baptism, without examination, the relation of an "experience," or a
   vote by the congregation. (3) Baptism and the Lord's Supper may be
   administered by any believer. (4) Weekly observance of the Lord's
   Supper. (5) No special "call" to the ministry expected or required and,
   in general, no sharp distinction between clergy and laity. (6) Denial
   of the authority of associations to exercise any power over local
   congregations (Baptists also denied this in theory), or to pass any
   judgment upon them, or to lay down conditions of fellowship and
   communion, as Baptist associations did when they excluded delegates who
   did not bring assurance that their churches adhered to the Philadelphia
   Confession.

   While the movement toward separation from the Baptists was approaching
   its crisis, two events occurred, both in 1829, which added greatly to
   the fame and prestige of Alexander Campbell and thus helped indirectly
   to get the Disciples off to a good start.

   Mr. Campbell was elected and served as a member of the Virginia
   Constitutional Convention. He answered those who criticized this entry
   into politics by saying that he wanted to urge the abolition of slavery
   or at least some steps in that direction. But he found that it would be
   impossible to do anything about slavery until the system of
   representation was so altered as to take away the concentration of
   power that was in the hands of the slave-owning aristocracy in the
   eastern part of the state. He fought a magnificent but losing fight on
   the floor of the convention for the abolition of the property
   qualification for voting and for representation in proportion to
   population. In advocating these democratic measures he faced, almost
   alone, such champions as John Marshall, John Randolph, and
   ex-presidents Madison and Monroe, all of whom were members of the
   convention. Anyone who doubts the intellectual and moral stature of
   Alexander Campbell will find a convincing demonstration of both by
   reading, in the published proceedings of the convention, his speeches
   in debate with these giants.

   A few months earlier, Mr. Campbell had engaged in a debate with the
   noted British social reformer, philanthropist, and skeptic, Robert
   Owen, on the general subject of the validity of the claims of
   Christianity and a religious versus a secular and materialistic view of
   the world. In his two earlier debates he had represented the Baptists
   against the Presbyterians. In his two later ones, he defended
   Protestantism against Roman Catholicism and certain aspects of the
   Disciples' position against its critics. But in the debate with Owen he
   had his most eminent opponent and his most exalted theme--the
   "Evidences of Christianity." For this occasion he was not the advocate
   of a party or a particular system of religious ideas, but was the
   champion of all Christianity. His own movement entered upon its
   independent existence with some of the glory of this splendid
   performance upon it.

CHAPTER VII
FIRST YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE, 1830-49

   With the dissolution of the Mahoning Association, the Disciples became
   a separate people with churches of their own, which were generally
   called "Churches of Christ." The disbanding of several Baptist
   associations in Kentucky within the next few months and the division of
   others added to the number of churches in the new body. Scattered
   through the entire area which had been affected by the teaching of Mr.
   Campbell and the Christian Baptist were many churches which were ready
   to follow the Reform, or had already begun to do so. Some of these
   voluntarily withdrew from the Baptist associations with which they were
   connected; others were put out. And in Baptist churches which adhered
   to their old position, the individuals or minority groups who accepted
   the new way were generally excluded. One point should be made clear:
   there is no known record of any case in which the Reforming, or
   Disciple, element in what had been a Baptist church ever excluded those
   who insisted on continuing to be Baptists.

   By 1833 the Disciples had been pretty thoroughly eliminated from the
   Baptist churches, to the number of something like twenty thousand
   members, nearly all in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, and
   Tennessee. Their most important accomplishments during the next two
   decades were: the growth of a conscious fellowship and the sense of
   being a united group; the union with the greater part of the western
   "Christian" churches; the development of institutions, customs, and
   procedures by which their common life and purpose could be expressed;
   and a remarkable increase in numbers and geographical extent.

   Mr. Campbell brought the Christian Baptist to an end with the
   completion of its seventh volume and immediately began the publication
   of the Millennial Harbinger, January, 1830. This was a larger magazine,
   devoted less to "detecting and exposing" the corruptions of the divided
   churches than to presenting a constructive program for curing their
   ills. Moreover, it had the responsibility, as the earlier magazine had
   not, of reporting the news of a movement which had now become a going
   concern and of discussing the problems which arose in the life of the
   new body. The name does not indicate any special interest in what is
   generally called the "millennium," as implying a visible second coming
   of Christ in the near future. The kind of millennium of which this
   magazine proposed to be the harbinger was the triumph of the Kingdom of
   God on earth. If that was ever to come, the editor thought, it could be
   only when the church had been purified and united.

   The Millennial Harbinger appeared monthly from 1830 to 1870. Mr.
   Campbell was its editor for nearly thirty years. During this time it
   was the backbone of Disciples' periodical literature. A great many
   small monthlies very soon began to spring up. Most of them had small
   circulation and short life, but their total influence was great, and a
   few became important. A list printed in 1845, and not claiming to be
   complete, names fifteen monthlies and two weeklies in existence at that
   time.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Disciples and Christians

   The union between the Disciples and the Christian churches in Kentucky
   and adjacent states west of the Alleghenies was an event of the utmost
   importance for the whole movement. Since the churches of both groups
   exercised a high degree of local independence, union could not have
   been brought about by any binding act of conferences or conventions,
   even if there had been general conferences or conventions in either
   party, as there were not. It had to depend upon a contagion of
   fellowship between their congregations in many communities. But the
   process was rapid, and the union may be dated as of 1832. It began with
   a consultation among some of their leaders on the first day of that
   year and was far enough advanced to insure its success before the end
   of the year.

   Barton W. Stone and Alexander Campbell first met in 1824. They were
   friends from the start, and both were impressed by the similarity of
   their pleas for simple and evangelical Christianity. In 1826 Mr. Stone
   began the publication of a monthly, the Christian Messenger, at
   Georgetown, Kentucky. In a communion having no general organization and
   no cooperative work, it was his position as editor which, more than
   anything else, gave him the prominence that has led to calling the
   Christian church in Kentucky, not very accurately, "the Stone
   movement." Since he wrote constantly and copiously for his magazine and
   also published reports of the activities of the churches and
   evangelists, it gives a good contemporary picture of his mind and of
   the principles and practices of the Christian churches during the years
   immediately before the union.

   The unity of all Christians was the theme of a series of articles which
   began in the first issue of the Christian Messenger, and the topic
   frequently recurs. Stone gives the arguments for unity and states and
   answers the possible objections. The principal obstacle to union, as he
   sees it, is insistence upon doctrinal agreement. Stone is for tolerance
   on all matters of opinion. Yet there are some doctrines in the orthodox
   creeds which Stone considers so erroneous that he is not content to say
   that they ought not to be made tests of fellowship; he must try to
   disprove them and eliminate them from the minds of all Christians.
   These are the generally accepted doctrines of the Trinity, the nature
   of Christ, and the atonement. Upon each of these subjects Mr. Stone
   wrote many long articles and editorials. He did not hesitate to say
   that "we deny the Trinity," not because it is mysterious but because it
   is not a revealed doctrine. The character of God is revealed, but not
   his essence or the mode of his existence. Christ was the Son of God,
   being of the same nature but not of the same substance. The Holy Spirit
   "means the power or energy of God, never a third person in deity."

   It is not surprising that the orthodox denominations regarded the
   writer of these statements as a dangerous man and the "Christians" as
   rank heretics. The orthodox, and especially the Presbyterians, would
   have been sensitive about such statements at any time; but just at this
   time they were in a more than usually suspicious mood, for the first
   year of the Christian Messenger (1826) was the very year in which the
   Unitarian, Dr. Horace Holley, had been dismissed from the presidency of
   Transylvania University, and Kentucky was still ringing with the
   conflict between the orthodox and the "liberals." So it was inevitable
   that the charge of "Unitarianism" should be hurled at Stone and his
   party. In the eyes of his most bitter critics, Stone was also a
   "Crypto-Arian" and a "Crypto-Socinian." Controversial pamphlets flew
   back and forth. As one reads them now, Stone seems to hold his own in
   theological scholarship and English style, and they cast no cloud upon
   his devotion to Christ or upon his zeal for the union of Christ's
   followers in one family of faith and the salvation of sinners by the
   power of the gospel. Stone was anti-Calvinist, anti-Trinitarian,
   anticreed, but he was not a Unitarian.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Likenesses and Differences

   Studying Campbell's Christian Baptist and Millennial Harbinger and
   Stone's Christian Messenger for the period shortly before the union of
   the two movements, one finds the evidence of some important likenesses
   and of certain differences, which were soon adjusted without much
   trouble. The likenesses were these:

   1. Both groups consciously and explicitly aimed to promote the union of
   Christians.

   2. Both rejected creeds and theologies as tests of fellowship, insisted
   on liberty of opinion on all matters of doctrine that were not
   considered as unmistakably revealed, and held that simple faith in
   Christ was sufficient.

   3. They agreed that Christ died for all and that all could believe on
   him and be saved.

   4. They agreed that saving faith, at least in its minimum essentials,
   was nothing else than an act of the mind in accepting rational evidence
   of the truth, and that even fallen and sinful man was capable of that
   act without special assistance from the Holy Spirit. This idea was
   prominent in Campbell's thought, and it was fundamental in Scott's
   method, which gave the Reformers their evangelistic drive. Stone had
   expressed the same idea earlier but he did not make much use of it, and
   the evangelism of the Christians does not seem to have been greatly
   affected by it.

   5. The practice of believers' baptism by immersion and the conception
   of baptism for the remission of sins were common to both, subject to
   some limitations to be mentioned presently.

   6. Both opposed the use of unscriptural names as sectarian and
   divisive. On Stone's side there was much argument that Acts 11:26 ("The
   disciples were called Christians first in Antioch") meant that they
   were so called by divine appointment, so that this name must be used.
   But this extreme opinion was not insisted upon, and Campbell's
   preference for "Disciples" was no obstacle. The use of the two
   names--and of "Churches of Christ" as well--confused the public but was
   no barrier to union.

   Replying to a correspondent who asked why the Christians should not
   unite with the "New Testament Baptists" (meaning Campbell's Reformers),
   Stone wrote in 1828: "If there is a difference between us, we know it
   not. We have nothing in us to prevent a union; and if they have nothing
   in them in opposition to it, we are in spirit one. May God strengthen
   the cords of Christian union."

   But there were some differences of emphasis and practice. The chief
   differences were these:

   1. The Christians did not make immersion a condition of membership.
   Most of them had been immersed, but they considered baptism as lying in
   the field of opinion, in which there should be liberty. Stone
   repeatedly defended this position. In 1830 he wrote: "These reforming
   Baptists are engaged in a good work. They proclaim union with all who
   believe the simple facts of revelation and manifest their faith by
   their works of holiness and love, without any regard to the opinions
   they may have formed of truth. Should they make their own peculiar
   views of immersion a term of fellowship, it will be impossible for them
   to repel successfully the imputation of being sectarians and of having
   an authoritative creed (though not written) of one article at least,
   which is formed of their own opinion of truth; and this short creed
   would exclude more Christians from union than any creed with which I am
   acquainted." Yet only a few months later he admitted feeling some
   inconsistency between preaching immersion for remission of sins and
   admitting to church membership without it. "When asked for our divine
   authority from the New Testament, we have none that can fully satisfy
   our own minds. In this state our minds have labored, and are still
   laboring." (Christian Messenger, Vol. IV, pp. 200, 275.)

   2. The Christians had at least the beginnings of a method of obtaining
   a responsible ministry. Stone criticized those who thought that a
   church could "induct into the ministerial office"; that function
   belongs to the "bishops and elders." If a minister is charged with
   "preaching doctrine contrary to the gospel," he should be examined by a
   "conference of bishops and elders." The idea was that the ministry as a
   whole, or by conference groups, should have power to protect the
   churches against erratic or unworthy ministers. There is no evidence
   that such control was actually exercised, but even the idea of such
   control was alien to the Disciples until much later, and still is with
   most of them. But at the time of the union, the Christians seem to have
   had a somewhat "higher" conception of the office of the ministry.

   3. The Christians were much more zealous in evangelism than the
   Reformers had been before the outburst of evangelistic fervor with John
   Smith and a few other "New Testament Baptists" in Kentucky and the
   campaign of Walter Scott in Ohio in 1827. But their method of
   evangelism had been of the Methodist type. There is clear evidence that
   theirs was, in practice, a "mourners' bench" revivalism, in spite of
   Stone's theory of faith as a rational act. Christian evangelists,
   sending to Stone's paper the reports of their meetings, write that
   "crowds of mourners came forward weeping and crying for mercy"; or,
   "the preachers had a good measure of the Holy Ghost and ... several
   [hearers] appeared to be cut to the heart and were crying for mercy";
   or, "crowds of weeping mourners came forward to unite with us in
   prayer"; or, more specifically, that the summer camp meetings (in
   Georgia) are "conducted in the main in the manner of Methodist camp
   meetings." Scott's new method of presenting the "Gospel restored" in
   clear steps created some surprise and questioning. A Christian preacher
   writes: "His method and manner are somewhat novel to me.... He seems to
   suppose the apostolical gospel to consist of the use of the following
   particulars: faith, repentance, baptism for remission of sins, the gift
   of the Holy Spirit, and eternal life. Thus, you see, he baptizes the
   subject previous to the remission of his sins or the receiving of the
   Holy Spirit." Stone replies: "We have for some time practiced in this
   way throughout our country." Evidently Stone had already come to a
   position identical with that of Campbell and Scott as to the nature of
   faith, the purpose of baptism, and the technique of evangelism. But
   just as evidently, the Christian preachers and churches generally had
   not. They had zeal for evangelism, but they still had much to learn
   about its method. Scott was their teacher.

   4. Whereas the Reformers early adopted the practice of observing the
   Lord's Supper every Sunday, the Christians did not. By 1830, Stone had
   decided that this was the practice of the early church, and he wrote:
   "Whenever the church shall be restored to her former glory, she will
   again receive the Lord's Supper every first day of the week." But he
   was less ardent than Campbell about "restoring the ancient order of
   things," and he was disposed to be patient about this as he was about
   immersion.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Union and Growth

   By 1830 the Christian churches west of the Alleghenies had, it is
   estimated, seven or eight thousand members in Kentucky, somewhat fewer
   in Tennessee, and smaller numbers in all the states to which migrants
   had been going from these two. There were district conferences in Ohio
   and Indiana, in Alabama and Mississippi; a Christian church organized
   in Missouri in 1816 was only the first of several; and there were two
   conferences in Iowa by 1828.

   The growing acquaintance and sympathy between Christians and Disciples
   led to a number of consultations between their leaders at various
   places in Kentucky, and finally to a meeting at Lexington, January 1,
   1832, attended by prominent representatives of both. It was unanimously
   agreed that they should unite. Since neither group recognized any
   church authority superior to the local congregation, actual union could
   be accomplished only by going to the congregations and persuading them
   to unite. "Raccoon" John Smith (Disciple) and John Rogers (Christian)
   went out as a team to carry this message to the churches. Others took
   it up. Stone's Christian Messenger and Campbell's Millennial Harbinger
   supported it. Within three years the greater part of the Christian
   churches in the area mentioned had joined the merger. On the points of
   difference, especially baptism and evangelistic method, the practice of
   Campbell and Scott prevailed. The Christians contributed a revived
   emphasis upon liberty of opinion and upon union, which the Reformers
   had been in danger of subordinating in their zeal for the restoration
   of "a particular ecclesiastical order."

   There had been, up to this time, no organizational connection among the
   three great groups of "Christian" churches. Those in New England and
   those in the southern Atlantic states were not affected by the merger
   with the Disciples. They tightened their denominational organization
   and continued their separate existence until, nearly a hundred years
   later (1930), they united with the Congregationalists.

   It is not possible to give a clear picture of the numerical growth and
   geographical expansion of the Disciples in their first twenty years.
   There were at first no organizations to promote the movement, no
   headquarters to project plans, no agencies to collect statistics, no
   yearbook to list churches and preachers. The energy of the movement was
   tremendous. As a plea for union, its appeal was to Christians of all
   faiths; therefore there was no hesitation about proselyting. As a
   presentation of the way of salvation, its message was to the
   unconverted. Both classes responded in large numbers. This "Gospel
   restored"--Scott's five steps in conversion--and the call to union on
   that basis were a simple message. One had only to hear it to believe
   it, and almost anyone who believed it could preach it--and a great many
   did. Most of those who evangelized went out on their own initiative and
   responsibility. The frontier was open, and there was a steady flow of
   migration to the west. Among the migrants were many preachers, who were
   often farmers also. But if there was no preacher in the new community,
   laymen might carry the message and plant the seed of a church. The
   distinction between ministers and laymen was often very vague. One who
   could preach became ipso facto a preacher. Besides farmer-preachers,
   there were lawyers, doctors, teachers, and merchants who preached, won
   converts, baptized them, and established churches.

   The need of some simple and efficient method of cooperation was soon
   felt. Some doubted whether any organization of the churches was
   scriptural. But the decision of most was that organized cooperation
   among the churches to spread the gospel--but not to exercise authority
   over the churches--was a proper expedient. A meeting of representatives
   of several churches at New Lisbon, Ohio, in 1831, and another at
   Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1835, reached this conclusion and
   considered ways and means of cooperation. A few glimpses, almost at
   random, at the beginnings of churches and organizations in certain
   states will indicate something of the method and rate of expansion
   during these two decades.

   In Indiana, several local movements, some beginning as early as 1810,
   contributed to the stream of the Reform. Some Free Will Baptists,
   regular Baptists, Dunkers, and "Christians" had arrived independently
   at similar ideas, and presently the Christian Baptist helped to unify
   them, and the merging of the Disciples and Christians completed the
   process. Their first cooperation for a specific purpose was when five
   churches joined in supporting John O'Kane as an evangelist, and his
   first work was to organize the First Church in Indianapolis in 1833.
   Indiana's first state convention was held in 1839, with fifty preachers
   present and reports of 115 churches with over 7,000 members. The state
   missionary society was formed ten years later. But the growth in
   numbers and churches--and it was rapid and substantial--was due to the
   work of individuals, local churches, and county cooperation more than
   to the state organization.

   The first Disciples in Illinois came from Kentucky and Indiana in 1830.
   Stone visited Jacksonville in 1832, preparatory to moving there two
   years later. He found a Christian church and a Disciple church, and
   persuaded them to unite. In 1834 a group of churches in that vicinity
   voted to employ an evangelist and issued an invitation to a state
   meeting. But the first state meeting was not held until 1842.

   To Missouri came the Christian preacher, Thomas McBride, from Kentucky
   in 1816, followed soon by Joel Haden, T. M. Allen, and others. By 1820
   there were eight churches. State meetings began, irregularly, in 1837.
   In that year a church was formed in St. Louis, but it did not persist
   and was started again in 1842. Missouri was, from the start, a "strong
   state" for the Disciples.

   Texas was still a part of Mexico when Collin McKinney, a devout
   "Christian" layman from Kentucky, came to the vicinity of Texarkana in
   1824 and then moved on to what became Bowie County, where he spent the
   rest of a long and active life. He did not have a church there until a
   preacher came in 1842; but when there was a church, McKinney was a
   pillar of it, as he was of the republic, and then the state, of Texas.
   The first church in Texas was one that came in a body from Tennessee,
   with reinforcements from Alabama and Mississippi, in 1836, and settled
   at Clarksville. Lynn D'Spain and Mansil W. Matthews were the preachers
   who came with this church. David Crockett accompanied this caravan on
   part of its journey. At that time the Mexican constitution prohibited
   the exercise of any religion except the Roman Catholic, but the
   agencies of enforcement were weak, the seat of government was far away,
   and the revolution which made Texas an independent republic was
   imminent.

   California had two churches, at Stockton and Santa Clara, within two
   years after the discovery of gold. They were established by Thomas
   Thompson, a Disciple preacher who went west with the forty-niners but
   preferred to evangelize, at his own expense, rather than to seek gold.
   This falls just beyond the limits of our period, the first two decades,
   but it illustrates the promptness with which Disciples followed the
   frontier. There is a report of a congregation organized in Oregon
   Territory in 1846, three years after the beginning of the "great
   immigration" and the very year in which American title to the territory
   was settled by treaty with England.

  Campbell at His Zenith

   Alexander Campbell's activities during these years were constant and
   varied. The Millennial Harbinger furnished a medium for the development
   and expression of his ideas and for the exchange of news and opinions
   among the churches. His many long tours for lecturing and preaching
   were more fruitful in building morale and gaining publicity for the
   movement than in winning converts, for he was never a very effective
   evangelist. But from the testimony of unbiased witnesses, he must have
   been one of the most impressive figures that ever stood upon an
   American platform. Mrs. Trollope, mother of the English novelist, and
   herself the author of Domestic Manners of the Americans, was present at
   the debate with Owen and described Mr. Campbell as "the universal
   admiration of his audience."

   In 1836 Mr. Campbell published a volume entitled The Christian System.
   This came near to being such an "exhibition of the fullness and
   precision of the Holy Scriptures upon the entire subject of
   Christianity" as Thomas Campbell had suggested in the Postscript to the
   Declaration and Address. Those who had felt the sting of his
   denunciation of creeds now shouted with glee that here at last was the
   "Campbellites' creed." But it was not a creed, because it was never
   used as a creed and was never intended to be so used. It was a rather
   full statement of Mr. Campbell's views on every religious topic that he
   considered important. But no church or organization of churches ever
   adopted it. No applicant for membership was ever asked to accept it. No
   minister's orthodoxy was ever tested by it. No one could even be
   required to read it. The book itself repudiates the notion of requiring
   conformity to this or any other body of doctrine. In it the author
   says:

     The belief of one fact is all that is requisite, as far as faith
     goes, to salvation. The belief of this one fact and submission to
     one institution expressive of it, is all that is required of Heaven
     to admission into the church. The one fact is expressed in the
     single proposition, that Jesus the Nazarene is the Messiah. The one
     institution is baptism.

   The Christian System, then, was certainly not a creed, since it
   declared that only "one fact and one institution" were essential.

   But when he placed the "one institution" on a par with the "one fact,"
   Mr. Campbell did not mean to imply that the unimmersed could not be
   Christians. A lady wrote from Lunenburg, Virginia, in 1837, expressing
   surprise at some reference he had made to unimmersed Christians. In
   reply to this "Lunenburg letter," Mr. Campbell wrote a memorable
   article for the Millennial Harbinger and followed it with two even more
   emphatic statements answering objections. In this article, he wrote:

     Who is a Christian? I answer, Everyone that believes in his heart
     that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the Son of God; repents of
     his sins, and obeys him in all things according to his measure of
     knowledge of his will....

     I cannot ... make any one duty the standard of Christian state or
     character, not even immersion....

     * * * * * * *

     It is the image of Christ the Christian looks for and loves; and
     this does not consist in being exact in a few items, but in general
     devotion to the whole truth as far as known.

     There is no occasion, then, for making immersion, on a profession of
     the faith, absolutely essential to a Christian--though it may be
     greatly essential to his sanctification and comfort.

   In answering an objection to the original article, Mr. Campbell stated:

     Now the nice point of opinion on which some brethren differ, is
     this: Can a person who simply, not perversely, mistakes the outward
     baptism, have the inward ... which changes his state and has praise
     of God, though not of all men?... To which I answer, that, in my
     opinion, it is possible.

   In 1837 Mr. Campbell defended Protestantism in a debate with the Roman
   Catholic, Archbishop Purcell, of Cincinnati. It was a period in which
   there was much anti-Catholic agitation, stimulated by what the Native
   American party called "the rapidly increasing political influence of
   the papal power in the United States" and by the violently reactionary
   policy of the papacy against every liberal and democratic movement in
   Europe. The public and the press had not yet adopted the hush-hush
   attitude toward the Catholic question. Neither of the contestants
   sought this controversy. They were virtually forced into it by the
   public interest in lectures which both had delivered before a teachers'
   association in Cincinnati. The debate was held in Cincinnati. It
   continued through eight days and made a great impression on the city.
   Mr. Campbell had now defended Protestantism against the highest Roman
   Catholic dignitary who ever participated in such a public discussion in
   this country, and he had earlier defended Christianity against one of
   the most eminent secularists and skeptics of the time. These debates
   were published and widely circulated.

   But for the exposition and defense of his own movement, the high point
   in Campbell's career as a debater was his debate with the Presbyterian
   minister, N. L. Rice, at Lexington, Kentucky, in 1843. Henry Clay
   served as moderator. The debate lasted for eighteen days. Four of the
   six propositions had to do with baptism. Campbell affirmed that the act
   is immersion and the purpose is the remission of past sins. Rice
   affirmed that the infant of a believing parent is a proper subject, and
   that baptism may be administered only by a bishop or ordained
   presbyter. In the other two propositions, Campbell affirmed that the
   Holy Spirit operates only through the Word in conversion and
   sanctification, and that creeds are necessarily "heretical and
   schismatical." This debate, published in a thick volume of more than
   900 closely printed pages, became a book of reference for generations
   of Disciples and perhaps did as much as any other one thing to
   standardize their thinking and practice.

   The duty of founding colleges for the education of ministers, the
   building of an intelligent laity, and the Christian culture of society
   was suggested almost as soon as the Disciples realized that they were a
   separate body committed to a long-term enterprise. A charter was
   obtained in 1833 for a college at New Albany, Indiana, but nothing came
   of it. The first actual college of the Disciples was Bacon College,
   founded at Georgetown, Kentucky, in 1836. The name was selected to
   honor Francis Bacon and to register approval of his empirical
   philosophy. Walter Scott was its first president, but he did little
   beyond delivering an inaugural address, and within less than a year he
   was succeeded by D. S. Burnet. The school was moved to Harrodsburg in
   1839, was discontinued in 1850, was revived as Kentucky University, and
   in 1865 was moved to Lexington, where it acquired the property and
   historic tradition of Transylvania University.

   Bethany College was incorporated in 1840 and opened soon after. Mr.
   Campbell projected and organized it, gave the land which became its
   beautiful campus, raised the money for its building and maintenance,
   and served as its president for more than twenty years. His writings on
   education, especially the series of articles in the Millennial
   Harbinger during the year when he was making his plans for Bethany,
   prove that he was an original and creative thinker in the field of both
   general and Christian education. His expectations as to the service his
   college would render to the movement as a whole were amply realized. It
   became for a time the principal training school for ministers and the
   educational center for the laity; and it was the "mother of colleges"
   among the Disciples.

CHAPTER VIII
ORGANIZATION AND TENSIONS, 1849-74

   As the Disciples grew and spread, the need of organization on a
   national scale was felt. There were still lingering doubts as to
   whether fidelity to the "ancient order of things" permitted such
   organization. But the prevailing decision was that meetings of
   "deputies, messengers or representatives" of the churches might
   properly be held if they would remember that they are "voluntary
   expedients" and "have no authority to legislate in any matter of faith
   or moral duty" but exist only "to attend to the ways and means of
   successful cooperation." These words, quoted from a resolution adopted
   by a conference on cooperation held at Steubenville, Ohio, in 1844,
   express the policy that became permanent.

   Mr. Campbell himself, laying aside any earlier prejudice against what
   he had called "popular schemes" among the denominations, urged "a more
   general and efficient cooperation in the Bible cause, in the missionary
   cause, in the educational cause." But so long as the Disciples had no
   agency of their own for foreign missionary work he recommended (1845)
   that they support the Baptist Missionary Society. And when, in the same
   year, D. S. Burnet and other brethren in Cincinnati organized an
   "American Christian Bible Society," he felt that this action was
   premature, that it was not sufficiently representative of the whole
   brotherhood, and that more could be accomplished with the available
   funds by contributing them to the (Baptist) American and Foreign Bible
   Society. He was no isolationist, and he bore no grudge against the
   Baptists, in spite of the acrimonies that had accompanied the expulsion
   of the Reformers from Baptist churches and associations a few years
   earlier. He also endorsed the Evangelical Alliance as soon as it was
   formed in 1846.

   The demand for a national convention that would represent the whole
   body of Disciples found voice through most of the influential journals.
   All who urged a convention spoke of it as a meeting of "delegates"
   appointed by the churches. To those who still objected that conventions
   and missionary societies were no part of the "ancient order," Mr.
   Campbell replied that in such matters of method and procedure the
   church is "left free and unshackled by any apostolic authority."
     __________________________________________________________________

  National Organization

   The first national convention of Disciples met at Cincinnati, October
   24-28, 1849, with 156 representatives from one hundred churches in
   eleven states. Some came as delegates with credentials from their
   churches. Others represented districts. The Indiana state meeting had
   elected messengers. But many ministers and active laymen were present
   who had no formal appointment and no credentials. Since these were
   well-known brethren, whose standing as representative Disciples no one
   could deny, and whose right to an equal status with the elected
   delegates it would have been embarrassing to challenge, it was voted to
   enroll all present as members of the convention. So this first national
   convention, though projected as a delegate convention, became a mass
   meeting.

   The organization of a missionary society was the principal business of
   the convention. The name first chosen was "Home and Foreign Missionary
   Society," but this was immediately changed to "American Christian
   Missionary Society," because "the missionary cause is one"--a truth
   that was rediscovered in 1919. The society's name meant that it was to
   be an American agency for missions throughout the world, including
   America. Alexander Campbell was elected its first president, and he was
   re-elected annually as long as he lived.

   No sooner had the convention been held and the society formed than the
   opposition to both flared up again. Jacob Creath, Jr., who had been
   opposed to the convention from the beginning, wanted to have another
   convention to discuss the legitimacy of conventions and societies. Some
   others argued that "the church is the only missionary society and can
   admit no rivals"; but these also objected to any arrangement for united
   action by the churches, so that, in their view, each congregation would
   have to be a separate missionary society. The criticism of conventions
   and societies on the ground that there was no New Testament command or
   precedent for them did not seem to have much popular support at this
   time, and it soon died down. But a few years later it became a highly
   controversial issue, and finally a divisive one.

   The first venture abroad was the Jerusalem mission, led by Dr. James T.
   Barclay. Even before the convention met and before the society was
   formed, Dr. Barclay had been pressing the cause of foreign missions
   upon the Disciples, had suggested Jerusalem as a field, and had offered
   his services. He was a man of fine culture, with a college degree from
   the University of Virginia and a degree in medicine from the University
   of Pennsylvania, and the depth of his piety equaled the ardor of his
   devotion to the cause. The selection of Jerusalem as the scene of the
   first foreign missionary effort was based chiefly on sentimental
   considerations. Since the gospel had first been preached "beginning at
   Jerusalem," it seemed fitting that the world-wide proclamation of the
   "gospel restored" should also begin there. Dr. Barclay and his family
   reached Jerusalem in February, 1851. After three and a half years of
   work, not entirely unfruitful but on the whole disappointing, he
   returned with the report that conditions did not warrant the
   continuance of the mission at that time.

   Soon after, the society attempted to plant a mission among the Negro
   freedmen who had migrated to Liberia. This colony on the west coast of
   Africa had but recently declared its independence, which had been
   recognized by most of the powers--except the United States. A Negro
   slave, Alexander Cross, was bought, freed, educated, and sent to
   evangelize among his own people; but he died of fever on the coast of
   Liberia before he could begin his work. In 1858 J. O. Beardslee, who
   had been a missionary in Jamaica with another communion, became a
   Disciple and returned to that island under the auspices of the American
   Christian Missionary Society. His work produced no notable results, but
   it may have helped to open the fray for the more substantial work in
   Jamaica some years later. These three--Jerusalem, Liberia, and
   Jamaica--were the only foreign missionary efforts in the twenty-five
   years during which the society undertook to conduct both foreign and
   home missions, and all three were counted as failures.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Growth, Journalism, Education

   During the quarter-century to which our attention is now directed, the
   American Christian Missionary Society did something toward sending
   evangelists to neglected areas and planting churches on the frontier.
   State societies did more. But the work that produced the very
   substantial growth in this period was done chiefly by churches and
   evangelists acting independently, by county and neighborhood
   cooperation, and by individuals who were following the westward tide of
   migration. While churches were being established in the new Western
   territories and states as fast as population flowed into them, there
   was also a steady increase of membership in the Central states, where
   the movement had had its beginnings. After a tour of Indiana in 1850,
   Mr. Campbell reported that "our people" in that state were second only
   to the Methodists in numbers, resources, and influence. Their standing
   in Kentucky at that time was certainly no worse. Development east of
   the Alleghenies was relatively slow and slight, except in Virginia and
   North Carolina, where early visits and preaching by Disciple ministers
   had proved fruitful. These two states would have been even stronger if
   they had not lost, while the Western states were gaining, by the
   westward current of migration. In other Eastern states there were some
   notable old churches, some of which originated under Haldanean,
   Sandemanian, or similar influences and became affiliated with the
   Disciples, but they did not greatly multiply.

   The total numerical growth from 1849 to 1874 was not merely
   substantial; it was amazing. By the middle of the nineteenth century,
   after twenty years of separate existence, the Disciples had about
   118,000 members. In the 1850-60 decade their numbers were almost
   doubled to 225,000. For 1870, the figure is given as 350,000. By 1875
   it was probably close to 400,000. This growth is the more remarkable
   because it was accomplished with very little help from promotional
   organizations and with very little general planning.

   The abundance and vigor of the periodicals devoted to the defense of
   the faith and the dissemination of news of the churches did much to
   make up for the lack of more official agencies of cooperation. The
   editors had no authority, but they exercised wide influence in the
   spread of ideas and the promotion of acquaintance among the Disciples
   in scattered communities. James M. Mathes published the Christian
   Record at various places in Indiana, with some intermissions, from 1843
   to 1884. By far the most influential editor, aside from Campbell and
   Errett, was Benjamin Franklin, a collateral relative of the famous Dr.
   Benj. Franklin.

   Our Ben Franklin began his long and notable editorial career in 1845
   with a paper which, beginning as the Reformer and passing through
   several changes and mergers, became the American Christian Review. He
   was a powerful supporter of the missionary society until, after serving
   as its secretary for a short time, he turned against it and became the
   most effective opponent of organized work. More important than this was
   the sledge-hammer evangelism that he carried on incessantly, with the
   spoken as well as the written word. Completely without formal
   education, he developed a clear and trenchant style which does not need
   his biographer's apologies. The favorite theme of his writing, and the
   sole theme of his preaching, was the "plan of salvation" and the plea
   of the Disciples for that simple gospel and the restoration of the
   church on the apostolic pattern. A volume of his evangelistic sermons,
   The Gospel Preacher, was the handbook for hundreds of other preachers
   and kept its popularity for half a century. One must know Ben Franklin,
   and realize how many there were like him, though built to a smaller
   scale, to understand how the Disciples grew so fast in this pioneer
   period--and why they ran into some difficulties later. Franklin also
   helped to save the Disciples from division over slavery and the Civil
   War by urging that the sole business of the church is to preach the
   gospel. In doing this, he also helped to fasten upon them the idea that
   the church must be neutral on all social and economic questions. A
   Christian "should make his money according to the laws of business and
   spend it according to the laws of God," said one eminent minister.

   About 1850 there arose a great zeal for founding colleges. In several
   states the Disciples had become strong enough, or felt sure that they
   soon would be strong enough, to support a college. Schools were needed
   to train ministers, to provide an educated laity, to hold the loyalty
   of the young people of their own families and win others, and to make
   their fair contribution to the culture of new communities in which
   there was little provision for tax-supported education.

   In 1845 the Disciples had three colleges: Bacon, at Harrodsburg,
   Kentucky; Bethany, at what is now Bethany, West Virginia; and Franklin,
   near Nashville, Tennessee. Within a year or two before or after 1850,
   at least nine colleges and institutes were established, most of which
   still live. These included: Kentucky Female Orphan School, Midway,
   Kentucky; Western Reserve Eclectic Institute, which became Hiram
   College, Hiram, Ohio; Northwestern Christian University, which became
   Butler University, Indianapolis, Indiana; Walnut Grove Academy, which
   grew into Eureka College, Eureka, Illinois; Christian College (for
   girls), Columbia, Missouri; Abington College, Abington, Illinois, which
   later merged with Eureka; Berea College, Jacksonville, Illinois, which
   died young; Arkansas College, Fayetteville, Arkansas, which met the
   same fate; and Oskaloosa College, Oskaloosa, Iowa, which had thirty
   useful years before it was dimmed by the brighter light of Drake
   University.

   The percentage of survival in this list is unusually high. It was much
   lower among the colleges started during the next twenty or thirty
   years. The cost of maintaining a good college, according to the
   standards of that time, was very little in comparison with present
   needs, but it was more than most of the eager college founders thought
   it would be. Many schools were started which had not a sufficient
   constituency. Others were brought forth by the local pride of an
   optimistic young settlement and withered away when its hope was
   deferred or its boom collapsed--for while Chicago and Kansas City grew
   miraculously, many a "future metropolis" of the Middle West remained a
   village. Few of the new colleges were adequately financed, even for a
   modest beginning. The mortality rate was therefore high. The Disciples
   were not alone in this. Other denominations lost many infant colleges.
   By 1865 there was a general complaint about the reckless multiplication
   of weak colleges. Moses E. Lard expressed the mind of many when he
   wrote: "We are building ten where we should have but one. One great
   university, with a single well-endowed college in each state where we
   number fifty thousand, is sufficient."

   One is rather surprised to find, running through several issues of the
   Millennial Harbinger in that same year, a discussion as to whether the
   Disciples needed a good theological school for the graduate training of
   the ministry. W. K. Pendleton, Campbell's son-in-law (twice) and his
   successor as president of Bethany College and as editor of the
   Millennial Harbinger, argued that there was need of a school to give
   ministers a professional education beyond what the colleges can or
   should furnish. Isaac Errett agreed with Pendleton. Ben Franklin,
   naturally, opposed. Nothing was done. For another thirty or forty years
   the Disciples continued to consider training for the ministry as a
   phase of undergraduate education.
     __________________________________________________________________

  "We Can Never Divide"

   Through these years the slavery issue was mounting to the crisis of
   war. All the churches were deeply stirred. Methodists, Baptists, and
   Presbyterians divided. Congregationalists, being practically all in the
   North and therefore all on the same side of the question, did not
   divide. The Episcopal Church peaceably divided when the country was
   divided by secession, and as peaceably reunited when the country was
   reunited. Disciples were nearly equal in numbers, North and South. They
   might easily have divided, but they did not.

   Alexander Campbell's sentiments were against slavery and he was never a
   slaveholder, but he lived in a slave state and had little sympathy with
   radical abolitionism. Much of the patronage and financial support of
   Bethany College came from the South, and he tried to keep the college
   neutral on these controversial issues. The first graduating class of
   Northwestern Christian University (Butler) was made up of a group of
   students who withdrew from Bethany in sympathy with a young man who had
   been expelled for making an antislavery speech after the public
   discussion of that question in the college had been forbidden. Campbell
   had elaborated his position in a series of articles in 1845: slavery is
   not condemned in the New Testament; therefore holding slaves is not
   sinful per se and cannot be a ground for withdrawing Christian
   fellowship; masters must do their full Christian duty toward their
   slaves, though it is admittedly very difficult to maintain a fully
   Christian attitude toward a person while owning him as a slave; slavery
   is economically bad and morally dangerous; and the policy to be
   followed in any situation is a matter of "opinion" and therefore within
   the area of Christian liberty.

   That useful distinction between faith and opinion, which was
   fundamental to the Disciples' program for union, now saved them from
   division over slavery and war. All political and social questions were
   to be treated as matters of opinion on which Christians might differ
   without dividing. Fourteen ministers in Missouri, including J. W.
   McGarvey, published in 1861 a "pacifist manifesto" urging Disciples to
   take no part in the war. They did not argue that war is always wrong or
   anti-Christian, nor did they discuss any moral issue of the war that
   was then beginning. Their whole point was that "our movement" would
   suffer disastrously if its members were to take arms against each
   other. Few Disciples were guided by their advice. Most of them, North
   and South, apparently felt that their attitudes in a great national
   crisis could not be determined by the consideration of what might
   happen to "our movement"--or else they thought that the movement could
   stand it, as it did.

   The first national convention after the outbreak of war, meeting at
   Cincinnati in October, 1861, took a ten-minute recess so that its
   members, not as the convention but as a mass meeting, might pass a
   resolution of loyalty to the national government. Two years later the
   convention itself adopted a stronger resolution deploring the "attempts
   of armed traitors to overthrow our government." But even this produced
   no division. It was a Northern convention because, under war
   conditions, there could, of course, be no representation from the
   South. Southerners realized that the resolution was merely an
   expression of Northern opinion, which they already knew; and many
   Northerners soon came to feel that it was a mistake for a sectional
   convention bearing a national name to pass a resolution purporting to
   express the sentiments of all Disciples, including the half of the
   country which could not possibly be represented. The organizational
   weakness of the Disciples became a strength in maintaining unity when
   the slavery issue and civil war threatened division, for there was no
   court to rule out any church or section and no convention empowered to
   set up standards or to pass any resolution that would have the force of
   law for the churches.

   "We can never divide!" shouted Moses E. Lard in his quarterly. If war
   could not divide us, he said, nothing ever can. But something
   could--and did. Disciples cannot divide through the exclusion of one
   element by another in control of denominational machinery, because
   there is no such machinery with power of exclusion. But it is possible
   to divide by voluntary withdrawal. If there is no power to put any
   church out, there is none to keep it in if it wants to go out. That is
   what happened some years later.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Period of Controversy

   The issues upon which division actually occurred had already arisen
   before the Civil War and they were so hotly debated in the years
   immediately after it that 1866-75 is sometimes called "the period of
   controversy." The principal topics which were discussed with greater or
   less heat during this period were these: open or close communion; the
   title, "Reverend"; the "one-man system" of the pastorate; the alleged
   introduction of a creed; the use of the organ; and the missionary
   societies. Only the last two of these had any lasting importance as
   divisive issues. The first four merely illustrate the heightening
   tension between the strict constructionists and those who favored what
   they considered reasonable expedients to meet changed conditions.

   When the Reformers were being excluded from Baptist churches and
   associations, they were accused of many things but not of departing
   from the Baptist practice of close communion. One must conclude that
   they had not yet departed from it. In 1828 Mr. Campbell objected to
   admitting the unimmersed to the Lord's Supper even occasionally,
   because he thought this would logically require admitting them to
   church membership. But the restriction upon the communion was gradually
   relaxed, without much talk about it, until Isaac Errett could write in
   1862, when the question was debated at length in the Millennial
   Harbinger, that probably two-thirds of the churches welcomed to the
   Lord's Supper all who considered themselves qualified to commune. The
   solving text was that each should "examine himself and so let him eat,"
   and the standard formula came to be, "We neither invite nor debar."
   There was, in fact, very little general controversy on this subject. In
   time the close communion practice disappeared so completely that most
   Disciples in the United States do not know that it ever existed and are
   somewhat shocked to learn that it still prevails in the British
   churches.

   The presentation to Mr. Errett of a silver door plate with "Reverend"
   before his name precipitated a brief but lively argument. Aversion to
   this title had been common among the earlier restorers of primitive
   Christianity. The Christian Baptist had said many a caustic word about
   clerical pretensions of dignity and usurpations of power, of which
   "Reverend" was considered a symbol. But as Disciples came to have more
   and larger churches and a ministry more clearly distinguished from the
   laity, they became less sensitive about a title which, in practice,
   meant only that its bearer was a minister. The title long remained
   unpopular, but the issue faded out.

   Protest against the "one-man system" had a similar motive but more
   substantial ground. The enlarging function of the pastor and the
   somewhat diminished prominence of the lay elders, as town and city
   churches with settled full-time ministers multiplied, evoked a futile
   resistance to the passing of those frontier conditions under which lay
   leadership for the churches had been successful. "Mutual edification"
   had been considered by many to be an essential part of the ancient
   order. No division came from this difference in practice and
   terminology, and the difference itself tended to disappear. One of the
   ultraconservatives gave the reason when he wrote: "Brethren, no system
   of edification can be scriptural if it doesn't edify."

   When Mr. Errett, as minister of a new church in Detroit, issued for
   public information a brief "Synopsis" of the Disciples' position, there
   was an outcry against it as a "creed." Strangely enough, the chief
   critic, Moses E. Lard, had himself put forth "sixteen specifications of
   fundamental principles." This episode is worth noting only because it
   shows how keen the legalists were to find proofs that the Disciples had
   become degenerate and had gone off after "innovations."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Not Divided--Yet

   The organ question, unlike the four issues that have been mentioned,
   cut deep, lasted long, and contributed to division. Protestant
   opposition to instrumental music in public worship began with Zwingli
   and Calvin (who were also strict restorers of primitive Christianity)
   and reappeared among New England Congregational churches in the
   eighteenth century. It did not become important among the Disciples
   before 1860, because there were few organs. About that time, L. L.
   Pinkerton said that he was the only preacher in Kentucky who favored
   the use of the organ and that his church at Midway was the only church
   that had one. The organ in public worship was, in truth, an
   "innovation." The case against it was completely stated by J. W.
   McGarvey in the Millennial Harbinger for November, 1864: The organ is
   not merely an aid to singing, like hymnbooks or a tuning fork, or a
   convenient accessory to the church building, like a stove, but is a
   distinct and novel element in worship; no element in public worship is
   legitimate unless it is explicitly authorized in the New Testament;
   instrumental music is not so authorized; therefore it is not
   legitimate. The crucial question was whether the New Testament does, as
   he claims, undertake to specify all the permissible elements of public
   worship. And the answer to that question is part of the answer to the
   larger question as to what is to be restored in the restoration of
   primitive Christianity. Back of that lies the still more basic question
   as to the nature of the New Testament. Churches did not disfellowship
   each other over the organ question, but many congregations divided on
   it.

   The most serious of all the controversies was about the missionary
   societies, national and state. Those who sought in the primitive church
   a model for all the procedures of the church, as well as a blueprint
   for its structure, found no justification for societies. There had been
   some protests when district and state meetings were first proposed and
   more when the national convention and missionary society were
   organized. This opposition had waned, but it was revived in the 1860's
   with new vigor and new journalistic champions. The war, the loyalty
   resolutions, acrimony over the organ, the failure of the society's
   three foreign missions, and the widening social and economic gap
   between the plain people of the country churches and the more
   sophisticated townsfolk--these all helped to bring in an era of ill
   will. Cultural isolation and the lack of educated leaders in this
   middle period favored the tendency toward a narrow legalism. The death
   of Alexander Campbell on March 4, 1866, after he had been president of
   the American Christian Missionary Society for more than sixteen years,
   made it possible for its opponents to dig up and reprint under his name
   the antisociety fulminations of the Christian Baptist forty years
   earlier. Almost at the same time Benjamin Franklin turned against the
   society and made his American Christian Review a powerful weapon of
   attack. The main onslaught was not against the management of the
   society but against the idea of having any society at all. However, all
   these hostile influences were the more damaging because the A.C.M.S.
   was not, in fact, doing much work.

   To satisfy the critics and prevent the threatened disruption, a
   completely new plan of cooperation was devised by a committee of
   twenty, including both society and antisociety men. The product of its
   labors was the "Louisville Plan," which was adopted almost unanimously
   by the convention of 1869. Under this plan the A.C.M.S. ceased to
   function. Its place was taken by a system of general, state, and
   district conventions, with boards, secretaries, and treasurers
   springing from and reporting to the three levels of conventions. In
   theory, it was a closely knit fabric of delegate conventions, the
   General Convention being composed of delegates from the state
   conventions, these of delegates from district conventions, and the
   district conventions of messengers elected by the churches. The wonder
   is that the antisociety men accepted it for a moment as (Ben Franklin's
   words) "a simple and scriptural plan." They did not accept it long, and
   even the friends of the society were cool to it. "Scriptural" or not,
   it was incredibly cumbersome and impractical. Receipts for national
   missionary work fell off from about $10,000 to an average of less than
   $4,000 a year for the next decade. Missionary cooperation had to take a
   fresh start; and so it did with the beginning of the next period.

   It was largely due to Isaac Errett and the Christian Standard that the
   Disciples did not become a legalistic and exclusive sect. The paper was
   founded at Cleveland in 1866--its first issue carried the news of
   Alexander Campbell's death--and it was moved to Cincinnati in 1869.
   Errett was already a man of power and distinction. He had been pastor,
   author, co-editor of the Millennial Harbinger, corresponding secretary
   of the American Christian Missionary Society, and president of the
   convention. In starting the Christian Standard he had the active
   support of General Garfield and three of the Phillips brothers of
   Newcastle, Pennsylvania. The new journal at once threw its influence
   boldly on the liberal side of all the controversial issues that have
   been mentioned. The Gospel Advocate already was, and the American
   Christian Review was soon to be, arrayed against all "innovations." To
   complicate the picture, the Apostolic Times was established with an
   impressive list of editors--Lard, Graham, Hopson, Wilkes, and
   McGarvey--who aimed to heal the incipient division by taking what they
   considered a middle-of-the-road position, against the organ but for the
   missionary society.

   The service of Isaac Errett would have been less significant than it
   was if it had been only the championing of the progressive side in
   certain controversies. What was more important was the breadth of his
   spirit, the depth of his religious life, and the power of his
   leadership away from a cramping legalism and toward a broader spiritual
   culture. In an article entitled "What Is Sectarianism?" in the
   Christian Quarterly, January, 1871, Mr. Errett restated the aim of the
   Disciples of Christ as union upon Christ, not upon our own
   interpretation of the Bible or on an exact pattern of the "ancient
   order of things." J. J. Haley later called this article "the
   Declaration and Address brought down to date."

CHAPTER IX
RENAISSANCE, 1874-1909

   After the dark ages of controversy and organizational stagnation--which
   were by no means so dark in other respects--came a renaissance in which
   the Disciples gained a clearer view of their central purpose and a
   better command of the resources for realizing it. They began to make
   more intimate contacts with the social and intellectual currents of the
   time and to escape from the cultural isolation into which they had
   fallen. Those who thought of this as apostasy from the true faith
   tended to withdraw, and ultimately did withdraw, into a separate and
   noncooperating group. The main body no longer took interest in what now
   seemed trivial disputes about organs, pastors, and the legitimacy of
   missionary organizations. The new issues which arose were such as were
   shared by the whole Christian world, so that even their dissensions
   related them to the main currents of religious thought.

   This period saw the continuance of westward expansion, the winning of a
   second and almost a third half-million members, the creation of new
   missionary and benevolent organizations, more than a hundredfold
   increase in giving for missions, new journalistic enterprises, an
   educational awakening, a new type of evangelism, new outreaches in
   Christian union and interdenominational cooperation, and some slight
   beginning of a discovery of social ethics as a field of Christian
   responsibility.

   The "dark ages" had not been stagnant in numerical and geographical
   growth. That process needed only to be continued. As the completion of
   the transcontinental railroads brought new land within reach for
   settlement, and as homesteaders invaded what had been the open range,
   towns sprang up throughout the West. In town and country, Disciples
   were there among the first, and churches were planted. After the
   American Christian Missionary Society was relieved of its foreign
   responsibilities, it could do more in promoting new work in the West.
   Soon the Board of Church Extension came to give first aid to the new
   church needing a house. It was never a log-cabin frontier west of the
   Mississippi (except Missouri and Arkansas), and building was a
   different problem from what it had been on the old timbered frontier.
   Even though the Disciples could draw less support from the East than
   some denominations, they became relatively strong in most of the
   Western states and very strong in some, such as Kansas and Oklahoma.

   Total estimated membership in 1875 was 400,000. The official figure was
   641,000 for 1890; 1,120,000 for 1900; 1,363,533 for 1910.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Journalism and Missions

   A new center of journalistic influence began when J. H. Garrison moved
   his paper, the Christian, from Quincy, Illinois, to St. Louis, on
   January 1, 1874, and organized the Christian Publishing Company. He had
   been on the point of moving it to Chicago, when the Great Fire of 1871
   intervened. B. W. Johnson's Evangelist, which had lately moved from
   Iowa to Chicago, merged with the Christian in 1882 to produce the
   Christian-Evangelist. By its conservatively progressive policy, it
   became at once a powerful force in leading the Disciples out of the age
   of sterile controversy and into a wider conception of religion and more
   active work in its promotion. The Christian Standard, at Cincinnati,
   under Isaac Errett, was already exercising a similar influence. As long
   as Mr. Errett lived, the two papers worked together for the same ends.
   The relations between these two great editors were always intimate and
   affectionate. Writing from his deathbed (1888) to his brother editor,
   J. H. Garrison, who was his junior by twenty-two years, Mr. Errett
   said:

     We have been together from the beginning of this missionary work. We
     have stood shoulder to shoulder ... and the two most effective
     instrumentalities in educating our people and bringing them into
     active cooperation in spreading the gospel in all lands have been
     the Christian-Evangelist and the Christian Standard; and indeed,
     upon all points of doctrine and practice and expediency you and I
     have always worked on the same lines in perfect harmony.

   A third paper, destined to hold a very prominent place in American
   journalism at a later date, was plodding its useful way through most of
   this period with a rather local constituency. This was the Christian
   Oracle, which began at Des Moines in 1884 and later moved to Chicago.
   In 1900 it became the Christian Century. For several years thereafter
   it reflected the liberal spirit of Herbert L. Willett, who was its
   editor for a time. Coming under the control and editorship of Charles
   Clayton Morrison in 1908, it soon began to evolve into an
   undenominational journal of religion.

   The real awakening of the Disciples came with the rise of their
   interest in missions. Legalistic controversy over missionary methods
   had previously absorbed so much energy that little was left for
   missionary work. The old society had barely kept itself alive. The
   Louisville Plan had been a total failure. Into this vacuum came a band
   of devoted women, led by Mrs. C. N. Pearre, of Iowa City, who formed
   the Christian Woman's Board of Missions in 1874. The organizing ability
   and untiring energy that went into it would have made almost any
   enterprise a success. The regular meetings of the local auxiliaries and
   of Junior and Intermediate groups and the publication of the monthly
   Missionary Tidings and other literature constituted a vast program of
   missionary education. A system of regular dues produced a trickle of
   dimes which aggregated a torrent of dollars. By 1909 there were 60,000
   adult members. Offerings up to that time had totaled nearly $2,500,000.
   Missions were conducted in Jamaica, India, Mexico, Puerto Rico,
   Argentina, and Liberia. There were schools in the backward Appalachian
   Mountain area, institutes and missions for Orientals on the West Coast,
   evangelists in thirty-three states, a missionary training school at
   Indianapolis, and "Bible chairs" at the Universities of Michigan,
   Virginia, Kansas, and Texas.

   In 1875, almost with the founding of the women's work, came the
   organization of the Foreign Christian Missionary Society. Its early
   development was slow, and it was ten years before it had an office of
   its own or a full-time secretary. By 1881 its annual income had risen
   to $13,178. It was still sending the gospel only to Christians. It had
   missions in Denmark, England, France, and among the Armenians in
   Turkey, and was planning to send (but did not send) missionaries to
   Italy and Germany. An address by J. H. Garrison, at the convention at
   Louisville in 1881, appealing for missions to the heathen, led
   immediately to the establishment of Children's Day for that purpose.
   The foreign missionary deadlock was at last broken. Receipts of the
   foreign society doubled the next year, and G. L. Wharton and seven
   others were sent to India. Japan was entered in 1883, China in 1886,
   the Belgian Congo in 1897, Cuba in 1899. A. McLean was an invaluable
   missionary leader for many years, and an unforgettable personality.

   When the American Society was permitted to devote itself wholly to
   American missions, its energies revived and it had an important part in
   the expansion that has been mentioned, as well as on the new frontier
   of foreign populations in the cities. In addition, it sponsored the
   Board of Church Extension, which at first made only small building
   loans to new and weak churches but later, as its resources increased,
   was able also to help some important city churches with their housing
   problems. George W. Muckley, as representative of Church Extension for
   nearly forty years, from 1888, linked his name inseparably with this
   cause.

   The National Benevolent Association, 1887, grew out of a purely local
   impulse in St. Louis, but its work expanded from a single orphans' home
   in that city to a long list of institutions for children and old people
   in all parts of the country. This and the Board of Ministerial Relief
   showed that the Disciples were awakening to social responsibilities of
   which they had not previously taken account on a national scale.
   Ministerial "relief" was found to be inadequate, but it prepared the
   way for the more businesslike Pension Fund.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Renaissance in Education

   At the beginning of this period a new birth in education was as badly
   needed as in organization and missions. It came, but not as promptly.
   The colleges had been founded largely as training schools for
   ministers, and they performed that function better than any other. From
   the Civil War to the end of the century they were poorly equipped,
   meagerly supported, and inadequately staffed. Since there were few high
   schools outside the cities, and the Disciples were 93 per cent rural in
   1890, entrance requirements and academic standards were necessarily
   low. The young preacher who had finished the ministerial course in one
   of these colleges was supposed to have completed his professional
   education.

   The educational awakening included three things: First, a few men in
   the 1890's, then scores and hundreds, went to the divinity schools and
   graduate departments of the great universities for further training
   after they had been graduated from the colleges of the Disciples.
   Second, these colleges themselves gained greater resources, raised
   their standards, and many of them became excellent institutions. Third,
   with well-trained men now available for faculties, there arose some
   graduate schools of sound quality in connection with a few of the
   Disciples' colleges. This advance proceeded slowly and on an uneven
   front. Some colleges became better than others, and some became better
   sooner. Some died because they could not meet the more rigorous demands
   of the modern age, including those of the standardizing and accrediting
   agencies; and some with small resources and low academic standards
   continued to render valuable service in educationally retarded areas.
   Most of the improvement in the colleges came after the beginning of the
   twentieth century. In 1897 there were forty-five educational
   institutions, including five "universities" and twenty-five colleges;
   and the total of their endowments was $1,177,000. Six years later this
   amount had been doubled. Thirty years after that, these doubled
   endowments had been multiplied by ten--and seventeen of the forty-five
   schools had disappeared.

   The establishment of the first "Bible chair" at the University of
   Michigan by the Christian Woman's Board of Missions was a piece of
   educational pioneering which led to great developments and became the
   Disciples' most original contribution to American education. There was
   a touch of genius in the discovery of the obvious fact, hitherto
   apparently unnoticed, that the students in state universities, which
   were growing enormously, offered a constituency for religious
   education, and the further fact that there were more young Disciples in
   state schools than in their own colleges. Bible chairs were established
   at many other state universities, some under the auspices of state
   missionary societies, others under independent boards. Some developed
   into schools of religion in which several denominations cooperated. The
   one at the University of Virginia became an integral part of the
   university. The whole development showed that the education of the
   future lay leaders did not rest wholly with the Disciples' colleges,
   indispensable as these were, but could be promoted by using also state
   or other endowed institutions.

   Similarly, the education of the ministry gained vastly by utilizing
   universities and theological seminaries maintained by others. Before
   1909 there was already a beaten trail from some of the colleges to Yale
   Divinity School, and the numbers who traveled it later ran into the
   hundreds. Many went to Union Theological Seminary in New York, and
   others to Harvard, Princeton, Hartford, or Vanderbilt. The University
   of Chicago, which opened its doors in 1892, furnished a seat of
   learning in the Middle West and therefore nearer to the geographical
   center of the Disciples. Though its divinity school was at first
   nominally Baptist, it appealed definitely to students of all
   denominations and successfully sought ways of evading the restriction
   of its faculty to Baptists. The Disciples Divinity House was
   established, 1894, in affiliation with the university and its divinity
   school, and at once a large number of students came, many of whom were
   mature men already in the ministry but eager for graduate study.
   Through all these means, by the end of the period here under
   consideration, the educational average of ministers among the Disciples
   had been greatly raised and their intellectual horizons vastly widened.
   The improvement of the colleges was one of the causes and also one of
   the consequences of this.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Higher Criticism

   The old differences of opinion about the organ and the missionary
   society continued, but there was no longer any interest in controversy
   about them. The opposing element ceased to cooperate with the
   "progressives" and was moving toward separation, which had become an
   accomplished fact, for all practical purposes, years before it was
   registered by the separate listing of the statistics of the "Churches
   of Christ" in the religious census of 1906.

   New issues arose which afforded topics for lively debate in the papers,
   at preachers' meetings, and at the Congresses which met annually after
   1899. Chief among these were higher criticism, the reception of the
   unimmersed, and federation. Since federation was the only one of these
   that called for collective action, and since it had very strong support
   as soon as it was proposed, it had full and frank discussion in the
   conventions also, as the other two questions did not.

   "Higher criticism," or the study of the Bible by critical methods of
   historical and literary analysis, began in Europe early in the
   nineteenth century. By the middle of the century, controversy had grown
   hot, especially because the new method did not assume the inerrancy of
   the Bible, as the older orthodoxy did, and because some of the results
   of research cast doubt upon the historicity of some parts of the Bible.
   American scholars reacted, positively or negatively, to the higher
   criticism during the two decades after the Civil War. It became fairly
   well known by name, though not well understood, and there were some
   famous heresy trials. But Disciples did not become generally aware of
   it until the 1890's. Professor J. W. McGarvey, stalwart opponent of the
   new methods, began in 1893 his Biblical Criticism Department in the
   Christian Standard. With acumen and acrimony he denounced every new
   conclusion or theory about such things as the authorship of Deuteronomy
   and the latter part of Isaiah or the date of Daniel as an attack upon
   the faith and the work of "enemies of the Bible." This weekly page was
   widely read and much discussed. It gave great publicity to the subject
   and, by its caustic tone, its pungent personalities, and its
   identification of higher criticism with infidelity, added bitterness to
   what would in any case have been a very real divergence of opinion.
   "Few scholars and few students were permanently influenced by the
   department," says McGarvey's biographer and long-time associate, W. C.
   Morro.

   Disciples were vitally interested in this battle of the Book, for they
   had always claimed to be, in a peculiar sense, a Bible people. Many of
   them remembered the first of Alexander Campbell's "rules of
   interpretation": in studying any book of the Bible, "consider first the
   historical circumstances of the book--the order, the title, the author,
   the date, the place, and the occasion of it." The young men who had
   been going to the Eastern universities and seminaries had become
   acquainted with the new methods of Bible study, which were directed to
   these very questions. The opening of the University of Chicago, just
   three months before the beginning of Professor McGarvey's
   antibiblical-criticism page, gave an immense impetus to this trend, for
   its president, Dr. W. R. Harper, was the most conspicuous exponent of
   these new methods in the United States, with extraordinary gifts for
   teaching and for publicity as well as for research. It might almost be
   said that it was Dr. Harper who put higher criticism on the map in the
   Middle West. Dr. Herbert L. Willett, who had been a student under
   Harper at Yale, became a colleague in his Semitic Department at Chicago
   and dean of the Disciples Divinity House. During several years he
   devoted much of his time to extension lecturing and the holding of
   institutes on the Bible. His popularity and success in this field were
   sensational. For most Disciples, Willett became the personal embodiment
   and symbol of the new biblical learning. He carried the flag with
   complete boldness, and his brilliant and winsome figure became a
   shining mark for the counterattack.

   The papers were inevitably involved in the higher criticism
   controversy. The Christian Standard's position was never in doubt. It
   was against it, not only on Professor McGarvey's page, but on every
   other page as well. The Christian-Evangelist was cautiously liberal
   editorially. Its editor was not a technical scholar in this field, but
   his mind was always alert to discover new truth. He was hospitable to
   the critical methods and was not alarmed by their results, even though
   he did not personally accept all of them. For several years he had Dr.
   Willett write for the paper the weekly article on the Sunday school
   lesson. This showed editorial courage, rather than caution, but it was
   part of a consistent editorial policy that did as much as a university
   could have done for the education of the Disciples.

  Rethinking Baptism

   "Open membership" had few advocates during the period under
   consideration, but there had already begun to be lively discussion of
   baptism in relation to the problem of union. When Thomas Campbell wrote
   the Declaration and Address--the event marked by the 1909 centennial as
   the beginning of the Disciples--he had not yet adopted the immersion of
   believers as part of the basis of union and communion. But after that
   practice was adopted by the Brush Run Church, it became an integral
   part of the program of the Campbells and it was a pivotal point in
   Scott's technique of evangelism. The "Christians" in Kentucky generally
   practiced immersion but considered it a matter of opinion and did not
   insist upon it. Those who merged with the Disciples yielded on this
   point and became strict immersionists. Campbell's reply to the
   "Lunenburg letter" showed that he regarded the pious unimmersed as
   Christians. Later developments showed that he would also commune with
   them as Christians. But he would not have favored admitting them as
   members, even if such a proposal had been made.

   The first Disciple to argue for the admission of the unimmersed was Dr.
   L. L. Pinkerton, in 1868. Pinkerton, a medical doctor as well as a
   preacher, was a remarkably free spirit and may be called the first
   thorough "liberal" among the Disciples. He also challenged the theory
   of the inerrancy of the Bible, though he probably never heard of the
   higher criticism. Apparently no other Disciple of his time shared his
   views about either baptism or the Bible, except John Shackleford,
   co-editor with him of the Independent Monthly, a breezy magazine which
   lived less than two years.

   W. T. Moore, a missionary in England for the Foreign Christian
   Missionary Society, about 1885 became minister of West London
   Tabernacle, an independent church having many unimmersed members.
   Defending himself against criticism in a convention to which he was
   reporting during a visit back home, he suggested that baptism might
   cease to be a barrier to union if it were agreed to recognize as
   baptized persons those who had already been sprinkled, whether as
   infants or as adults, but to practice only immersion thenceforth. In
   spite of the high regard in which he was held, this opportunistic
   proposal found little favor. At the Congress of Disciples in 1901, Dr.
   Moore renewed and elaborated this proposal, that a united church be
   formed at once with all Christians as members and that only immersion
   should be practiced thereafter.

   Robert L. Cave, an eloquent Virginian, who was pastor of Central
   Christian Church, St. Louis, in 1889 issued a pronunciamento widely at
   variance with the generally accepted views of Disciples, and of other
   evangelical Christians, on many points and demanded a vote of
   confidence on that basis. Failing to get it, he withdrew, followed by
   nearly half of the members, and established the Non-Sectarian Church.
   This was the outstanding heresy case of the period. But Dr. Cave's
   rather casual treatment of baptism was such a small item in the sum of
   his heresies that it was scarcely noticed, and the whole episode
   produced a conservative reaction even in the minds of moderately
   progressive leaders. The editor of the Christian-Evangelist at once
   launched a doctrinal revival, the permanent record of which is the
   volume entitled, The Old Faith Restated. Dr. Cave's advocacy did more
   to retard than to advance the acceptance of liberal ideas, including
   ideas about baptism.

   In the 1890's the religious papers began to print contributions
   discussing the function of baptism and questioning whether it is
   indispensable. R. T. Matthews, a professor at Drake, said that some of
   the unimmersed "are in essential union with Christ." John Shackleford
   denied McGarvey's statement, in the first edition of his Commentary on
   Acts, that "faith without immersion is dead." J. J. Haley, when pressed
   to declare categorically whether he thought baptism necessary, gave the
   Delphic answer that baptism is "as necessary as an ordinance can be,
   considering what an ordinance is." Thomas Munnell, former missionary
   secretary and one of the most honored veterans, wrote a long article,
   in the New Christian Quarterly, April, 1894, arguing that the
   requirement of baptism be waived in the interest of union. In the
   correspondence columns of the weeklies, there were expressions of the
   opinion that a Christian union movement which excludes from its
   churches a large proportion of those whom it regards as Christians is
   both illogical and futile. These were the opinions of a small minority,
   and there were vigorous replies. In 1901 Dr. H. L. Willett published a
   little book, Our Plea for Union and the Present Crisis, which was a
   bold argument for open membership.

   Along with much discussion, there was some action, but only a little
   within this period. J. M. Philputt was minister of a church on 119th
   St., New York, which from about 1890 to 1900 received the unimmersed as
   "members of the congregation," not of the church. "We receive them," he
   explained, "not as Disciples of Christ but simply as Christians." This
   distinction proved embarrassing. The practice drew too much criticism
   and it was abandoned. Similar "associate membership" arrangements were
   practiced for some time at South Broadway, Denver (B. B. Tyler); at
   Central, Denver (W. B. Craig); at Shelbyville, Kentucky; and elsewhere.
   At Hyde Park, Chicago (now University Church of Disciples of Christ),
   Dr. E. S. Ames in 1903 led the church into receiving unimmersed persons
   as "members of the congregation." Though the distinction between the
   two classes of members seldom came to attention it was not formally
   abolished until 1919 when the church became, de jure as well as de
   facto, an open-membership church. Long before that, in 1906, the Monroe
   Street Church, Chicago, of which Charles C. Morrison was pastor, had
   become the first church among the Disciples to receive into full
   membership the unimmersed members of other evangelical churches. When
   Morrison took over the Christian Century in 1908, he promptly made it
   an outspoken champion of liberal views, including open membership.

   As the last item in the record of changing views on baptism within this
   period, it may be noted that at the Centennial Convention at
   Pittsburgh, 1909, Dr. S. H. Church, a grandson of Walter Scott,
   delivered an address in which he held that baptism is a matter of
   opinion in regard to which there should be individual liberty.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Federation

   The movement for federation among the Protestant denominations quickly
   won the favor of all Disciples except the most rigidly noncooperative,
   but these were many, and their voices were loud. The impulse to
   federation came from the new sense of the social responsibilities of
   the churches which became acute in the latter part of the nineteenth
   century. It was first proposed by the Presbyterian General Assembly as
   a means of getting some united action by Protestants without
   compromising their denominational differences and independence. After a
   decade of desultory discussion and some local organizations, a national
   Federation of Churches and Christian Workers was formed in 1901. The
   next year this body proposed a conference of official representatives
   of denominations to consider the feasibility of a federation of the
   denominations as such. It was at this point that the matter came before
   the Disciples through a brief speech by the secretary, Dr. E. B.
   Sanford, at the Omaha convention in 1902, following an eloquent address
   on Christian union by E. L. Powell. A resolution of approval was
   introduced by J. H. Garrison, who supposed--naïvely, as he afterward
   said--that it would be adopted unanimously. J. A. Lord, editor of the
   Christian Standard, objected that joining such an association would be
   "recognizing the denominations." The resolution was adopted, with only
   a small opposing vote. But the war was on, with the two papers already
   ranged on opposite sides. For the next four or five years, federation
   was the hot spot of controversy in conventions, ministers' meetings,
   and the press. The Disciples were represented, however, at the
   Interchurch Conference on Federation, at Carnegie Hall, New York City,
   in November, 1905, where a constitution was drafted. A mass meeting
   called during the Norfolk convention in 1907 approved the constitution,
   with only one dissenting voice, and elected representatives in the
   Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America. The first meeting
   of the Federal Council was held at Philadelphia, February 2, 1908.

   Thus the Disciples were in the Federal Council from its beginning. They
   also cooperated from the start with the Foreign Missions Conference of
   North America (1907) and the Home Missions Council (1908). Union as an
   objective had not been forgotten; but, while there were barriers to
   immediate union, cooperation with other Christians in the promotion of
   practical Christian ends had come to seem, to the great body of
   Disciples, both safe and wise.

   The completion of the first hundred years was celebrated by a
   Centennial Convention, at Pittsburgh, October, 1909. This was a
   gathering of unprecedented and still unequaled size. It quickened the
   interest of Disciples in their own history and heritage. Coming so soon
   after they had embarked upon these large ventures in cooperation, it
   directed their minds not only to the numerical and institutional
   success of their own movement but also to the path of common service
   and the hope of unity that lay ahead. It was a true instinct that
   directed the choice of the centennial of the Declaration and Address
   for this observance rather than, for example, the promulgation of
   Walter Scott's "uniform, authoritative method of proclaiming the
   gospel," or the dissolution of the Mahoning Association. This choice
   expressed the feeling that the essence of the movement is not in its
   separateness or in its "particular ecclesiastical order," but in its
   call for union upon the will to do the will of Christ.

CHAPTER X
GROWING INTO MATURITY, 1909-45

   Growth in numbers had been very rapid during the first eighty years. It
   was not unusual to hear the confident prediction that at this rate they
   would soon "take the country," and it seemed disloyalty to doubt that
   the rate of increase would continue. But the population of the country
   was also growing very rapidly, though not so rapidly as the Disciples.
   So long as there was an open frontier--that is, until about 1890--and
   even later, while the heavy westward migration continued, the Disciples
   outran the general population increase. But so also did the Methodists
   and Baptists. Immigration from Europe brought tremendous reinforcements
   to Roman Catholics and Lutherans, none to Disciples; and Disciples
   gained by conversion almost none of these immigrants or their children.
   The nation was becoming increasingly urban, while the Disciples
   remained more rural than other large communions. Inevitably there were
   diminishing returns in growth.

   There was a high point in 1910. It was higher still in 1914, with an
   abrupt drop of nearly 300,000 to 1915, and a fair rate of growth
   thereafter. An improvement in statistical methods probably explains the
   greater part, though perhaps not all, of the apparent loss in 1915.
   Certainly there was no great disastrous event in that year. Perhaps
   some of the "Churches of Christ" were included in the count until 1915.
   Here are the figures since 1900:

   1900 1,120,000
   1905 1,238,515
   1910 1,363,533
   1915 1,142,206
   1920 1,178,079
   1925 1,450,681
   1930 1,554,678
   1935 1,618,852
   1940 1,669,222
   1944 1,681,933
     __________________________________________________________________

  Improving the Machinery

   With the recognition of many fields of responsibility besides home and
   foreign missions and the consequent multiplication of societies, each
   having an annual "special day" to promote its work and raise its funds,
   a good deal of rivalry and confusion ensued. There were not enough days
   to go around. For example, the Foreign Society bitterly opposed the
   claim of the new American Christian Education Society (1903) upon the
   third Sunday in January as Education Day, because this interfered with
   the exclusive occupancy of January and February in preparation for
   Foreign Missions Day, the first Sunday in March; but it could do
   nothing about it because the latter was an independent and
   theoretically coordinate society. Moreover, the conventions were
   conventions of the societies rather than of the churches.

   The first step toward remedying this condition was the appointment of a
   "calendar committee," at Buffalo in 1906, to devise a plan for reducing
   the number of special days. There was no immediate result. At New
   Orleans in 1908, the constitution of the American Christian Missionary
   Society was amended to provide for a delegate convention in which every
   church, whether contributing or not, should have elected
   representatives. So much parliamentary confusion attended this action
   that it was not carried into effect. The Centennial Convention of 1909
   appointed a standing committee to consider unifying all missionary and
   philanthropic work under one or two boards. The committee's intimation
   that it would recommend a strictly delegate convention to which all
   societies should report touched off a long and heated discussion.
   "Delegate convention" became, for the more conservative element, a
   symbol of apostasy, as "higher criticism" and "federation" had been a
   few years earlier.

   The formal report of the committee was made at Louisville in 1912, and
   the vote was almost unanimous in favor of a general convention to be
   composed of elected and accredited delegates from the churches. The
   convention of the following year, at Toronto--which was supposed to be
   composed of delegates but was not, because few churches sent
   them--ratified the delegate plan which it failed to exemplify. In
   subsequent conventions also there were few delegates. The delegate
   system failed not because of opposition but because of indifference to
   it. The vast majority of churches did not elect delegates, and habitual
   convention-goers continued to go whether they were delegates or not. At
   Kansas City, 1917, a new constitution was adopted, which, while
   retaining the delegate feature, made it meaningless by giving equal
   voting power to all members of churches who were in attendance. (It was
   like having an elected Congress with the provision that any citizen who
   cares to attend its sessions shall have all the powers of a
   congressman.) But with a large and representative "Committee on
   Recommendations" serving as an upper house, the plan works surprisingly
   well.

   A national publication society, to be owned by the brotherhood and
   operated for its benefit, seemed desirable to many. A committee was
   appointed in 1907 to study the problem. Mr. R. A. Long solved it by
   agreeing, in December, 1909, to buy all the stock of the Christian
   Publishing Company, publishers of the Christian-Evangelist and of books
   and Sunday school materials, and place it in the hands of a
   self-perpetuating board of directors, all profits to be appropriated to
   the missionary and other enterprises of the Disciples. The fears of a
   regimentation of opinion by an "official" journal and publishing house
   have proved groundless. The Christian Board of Publication is, in fact,
   no more "official" than are the Disciples' colleges, which have exactly
   the same kind of ownership and control. But the brotherhood does get
   the profits, which have totaled much more than Mr. Long's original
   gift.

   Mr. Long was also the prime mover in, and the largest donor to, the Men
   and Millions Movement, the aim of which was to enlist a thousand men
   and women for religious service and to raise six million dollars for
   missions and colleges. The campaign, beginning in 1914, was interrupted
   by the war, but its financial goal was finally reached.

   The unification of missionary agencies had been suggested at least as
   early as 1892 and discussed at intervals thereafter. Before it was
   accomplished, the separate societies had already reformed some of the
   evils of the old system by establishing a joint budget committee to
   make the securing of funds for the various interests cooperative rather
   than competitive, and by stressing weekly giving for missions as part
   of each congregation's financial system instead of relying upon spasms
   of appeal on special days. Conditions caused by World War I doubtless
   precipitated the consolidation of the societies. In 1919 the home and
   foreign missionary societies, the Christian Woman's Board of Missions,
   the boards of church extension and ministerial relief, and the National
   Benevolent Association were merged to form the United Christian
   Missionary Society. F. W. Burnham was its president until 1929.

   Some Disciples, without being opposed to societies on principle, had
   long been critical of much that the societies did and the way they did
   it--their "cold institutionalism" and "bureaucratic methods" and their
   concern with so many things other than winning converts by the simple
   plea of faith, repentance, and baptism and organizing churches
   according to the ancient order. The United Society fell heir to these
   hostilities and aroused more. One result was an increase in the number
   of "independent agencies." These have a loose bond among themselves as
   the "Associated Free Agencies." The Christian Standard, chief
   journalistic critic of the organized work, publicizes these agencies
   and, together with the Christian Restoration Association, lends them
   its support. The annual North American Christian Convention appeals
   primarily to those who stand aloof from the United Society and support
   the independent agencies.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Widening Educational Horizons

   The remarkable improvement of the Disciples' colleges has been an
   indication of the widening intellectual outlook of the communion and
   also one of the causes of it. The increase of endowments was only one
   aspect of the improvement, but an essential one. In the first thirty
   years of this century, the total of their endowments rose from
   $3,300,000 to $33,000,000. There was similar betterment of buildings,
   libraries, and equipment. Academic standards were raised, and faculties
   were better trained for their specific tasks. The transformation of
   Bethany College, beginning with the administration of President T. A.
   Cramblet, from the decadent and moribund state into which it had fallen
   to its present admirable and flourishing condition, is an example of
   what several colleges achieved. Drake, Butler, Phillips, and Texas
   Christian University gained honorable prominence in their states and
   beyond. These four developed graduate schools for the ministry, or
   raised toward full graduate status the departments they already had.
   The College of the Bible, at Lexington, entered upon a new epoch.
   Transylvania, always prominent in Kentucky, resumed the ancient name
   which identified it as "the oldest college west of the Alleghenies."
   There were also casualties among the colleges. As costs increased and
   academic requirements stiffened, some were forced to close down. Cotner
   was one of these.

   Meanwhile, much larger numbers of the younger ministers have been
   taking advantage of the resources of other universities and seminaries.
   Hundreds have gone to Yale Divinity School, hundreds more to the
   Divinity School of the University of Chicago and the Disciples Divinity
   House. The pastors of the great majority of the larger churches at the
   present time are men who have had such education. Likewise the
   faculties of the Disciples' colleges and of their graduate schools for
   the ministry are composed, almost without exception, of
   university-trained men. The "cultural isolation" of the Disciples has
   definitely ended.

   The Congresses of the Disciples, which began in 1899 and were held
   annually until about 1925, were a valuable means of adult education for
   ministers. These were gatherings for the discussion of religious,
   theological, and social problems which could not properly come before
   the conventions. They were characterized by great freedom of utterance.
   At first, all phases of opinion were represented, but as the more
   conservative element gradually dropped out, the congresses lost much of
   their value.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Liberal Tendencies

   Through all these agencies, the liberalizing effects of the newer
   learning were widely diffused. One aspect of this was that a great
   number of ministers accepted the so-called "modern view" of the Bible,
   based upon historical and critical methods of study, in place of the
   theory of inerrancy and level inspiration. Proof texts lost something
   of their finality. The pattern of the primitive church seemed somewhat
   less sharply drawn, and the duty of restoring it in every detail less
   axiomatic. Christian truth and duty were seen as far more extensive,
   and far less simple, than the conversion formula and the restoration of
   the ancient order as these had been conceived. In this atmosphere of
   opinion, the stress was upon union, while the concept of restoration
   seemed to require reinterpretation to give it continued validity. All
   this had begun to happen in the previous period; but now it happened on
   a large scale, reaching many important pulpits, the colleges, the
   missionary executives, the missionaries themselves.

   It was no longer possible to say that only a little coterie of young
   men held and taught these disturbing ideas. Their spread could not
   plausibly be charged to the Campbell Institute, though this provided a
   free forum for its members. The Campbell Institute began in 1896 as a
   company of fifteen young men who had done some graduate work, or were
   still doing it. It was organized, as its constitution says, "to enable
   its members to help each other to a riper scholarship by a free
   discussion of vital problems; to promote quiet self-culture and the
   development of a higher spirituality both among the members and among
   the churches with which they shall come in contact; and to encourage
   productive work with a view of making contributions of permanent value
   to the literature and thought of the Disciples of Christ." The young
   men grew older, and their number increased to several hundred. The
   institute's meetings were all open to the public, its membership was
   opened to any college graduate who cared to enroll, and a wide variety
   of theological opinions found expression on its programs and in its
   organ, the Scroll. It never pulled a wire to get one of its members
   into a position of honor or leadership. Still, it was and is of some
   significance as an incentive to untrammeled thinking, an organization
   liberal enough to be equally hospitable to liberal and conservative
   opinion.

   The Christian Century, immediately after C. C. Morrison became its
   proprietor and editor in 1908, became the exponent of a more liberal
   theology than had ever been voiced by any Disciples' paper, an equally
   liberal social outlook, and the strongest possible emphasis upon the
   unity of all Christians. Gradually, and quite definitely from about
   1920, it became an undenominational journal with a large constituency
   among all communions. The prestige that it gained in the wider field
   and its complete editorial independence gave it great influence among
   thoughtful Disciples as a stimulus to their own thinking even if they
   did not go all the way with it.

   The Association for the Promotion of Christian Unity, which grew out of
   a meeting called by Peter Ainslie at the 1910 Topeka convention, of
   which he was president, stressed the things which the Disciples held in
   common with other communions and, through many years, sought ways of
   cultivating this fellowship. While the association itself did not
   espouse open membership, it did not envision union by the universal
   acceptance of the Disciples' "historic plea" for the immersion of
   penitent believers for the remission of sins and the restoration of the
   pattern of the New Testament church as they had understood it. But Dr.
   Ainslie, who was president of the association for many years, became an
   outspoken advocate of open membership, which he called "recognizing the
   equality of all Christians before God."

   Missionaries in certain foreign fields, especially China, were reported
   to be too little concerned with baptizing converts and too much
   involved in activities other than pressing the "distinctive plea" of
   the Disciples. Whether or not they actually received Chinese Methodists
   or Presbyterians who had no other church home, remained a disputed
   question even after a self-appointed investigator had gone to China and
   reported that they did.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Conservative Reaction

   From all these circumstances there arose a vigorous campaign of
   criticism against all the agencies that seemed implicated in this
   liberal tendency. The attack upon Transylvania University and the
   College of the Bible, long a citadel of orthodoxy but now manned by
   younger men of university training, was spearheaded by the Bible
   College League in 1916. It failed to accomplish its purpose. The
   "Medbury resolution," passed by the 1918 convention, demanded that the
   Foreign Society forbid the reception of unimmersed persons into mission
   churches in China. An explanation by Frank Garrett that what looked
   from a distance like open membership in China was really not that,
   because the mission communities were not fully organized churches,
   brought the repeal of the Medbury resolution.

   But criticism was only checked, not silenced. The "restorationists"
   organized the New Testament Tract Society to spread "sound doctrine."
   The Board of Managers of the new United Society adopted an affirmation
   of allegiance to the "historic position" of the Disciples, including
   immersion, signed it themselves, and required all missionaries to sign
   it. The 1922 convention adopted the "Sweeney resolution," which
   approved this action and put teeth into it. A "peace committee," in
   1924, failed to agree, and the Christian Standard led in organizing the
   Christian Restoration Association and began to publish the Restoration
   Herald. The Oklahoma City convention of 1925 adopted a resolution by
   which it ordered the recall of any missionary who "has committed
   himself to belief in the reception of unimmersed persons into church
   membership," and voted to send a commission to the Orient to find the
   facts. The commission reported that it found no open membership in
   China, and the Board of Managers officially interpreted the Oklahoma
   City resolution as "not intended to invade the right of private
   judgment, but only to apply to such an open agitation as would prove
   divisive." The critics repudiated both the report and the
   interpretation and, when defeated in the 1926 Memphis convention,
   called the first "North American Christian Convention" for October,
   1927. This convention, repeated annually, has continued to be the
   rallying place of the opponents of the United Society.

   While open membership has been thrust into the foreground in the
   controversy between the United Society and its critics, the society
   does not avow sympathy with that practice and refuses to admit that
   this is the real issue. But it cannot be doubted that there are two
   contrasting views as to the basis of the Christian unity which
   Disciples seek and the nature and scope of the restoration at which
   they aim. Under this difference lie two views of the Bible, and from it
   flow differences of emphasis upon baptism. The admission of the
   unimmersed is openly defended by relatively few, but quietly practiced
   by a good many. Still more are restrained from it, not by their own
   convictions, but by the feeling that at present it would promote
   division rather than unity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  An Ecumenical Outlook

   All Protestantism has been seeking ways of cooperation and dreaming of
   unity during the past forty years. In these efforts the Disciples have
   had their full share, and their hope of unity has been more than a
   dream. The revived conception of an ecumenical church is congenial to
   their best tradition and has stirred them to reconsider the ways in
   which they may help in its realization.

   The Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America has been the
   foremost cooperative agency since 1905. A Disciple suggested that name,
   and Disciples had a part in its organization and have been well
   represented in its leadership. Jesse Bader has been at the head of its
   department of evangelism for many years. Herbert L. Willett was in
   charge of its Midwestern office for a considerable period. Edgar DeWitt
   Jones has served as its president. The Disciples have entered heartily
   into cooperative educational work in foreign missions and into comity
   arrangements both at home and abroad for the allotment of fields and
   the distribution of forces to prevent duplication and competition. A
   Disciple missionary, Samuel Guy Inman, has been the leading spirit in
   the Committee on Cooperation in Latin America. The Interchurch World
   Movement, which aimed at a revival of Christian work and the
   strengthening of all Christian institutions immediately after World War
   I, was overambitious and became a costly fiasco. Disciples shared in
   this, too, and paid their part of the staggering deficit.

   What is more explicitly called the Ecumenical Movement began with a
   World Conference on Foreign Missions, at New York City in 1900. This
   led to a similar conference in Edinburgh in 1910. The Disciples were
   not represented in the organization or on the program of either of
   these. In the minds of the promoters of these conferences, they were
   still an unknown people, or a minor sect. Some Disciples attended,
   however, as unofficial observers. Beginning with the problem of unity
   in missions, the Ecumenical Movement expanded to become "Life and Work"
   (Stockholm, 1925, and Oxford, 1937) and "Faith and Order" (Lausanne,
   1927, and Edinburgh, 1937). The problems of Christianity in relation to
   other world religions were studied at the Jerusalem Conference, 1930,
   and those of the "younger churches" of the mission lands at Madras,
   1939. In all these ecumenical gatherings, the Disciples have had a
   recognized place and have taken an active part. They have also recorded
   their adherence to the World Council of Churches, which grew out of the
   Oxford and Edinburgh conferences of 1937.

   Sunday school work had an undenominational aspect at its very
   beginning, early in the nineteenth century. Disciples took part in the
   International Sunday School Association, organized in 1872, and adopted
   its uniform lessons. B. B. Tyler was its president in 1902. Other
   organizations arose to develop more modern phases of religious
   education. Robert M. Hopkins was prominent in the Sunday School Council
   from the start, and he was chairman of the executive committee of the
   International Council of Religious Education for eleven years after its
   formation by the union of the old International Association and the
   Sunday School Council in 1922. Roy G. Ross is now executive secretary
   of the International Council. Many other Disciples, experts in various
   phases of this work, have borne heavy responsibilities in these
   organizations, especially in the latest and most comprehensive one.

   In brief, no communion has been more active in all the cooperative
   enterprises of the churches in recent years, or more sympathetic with
   the ecumenical trend toward thinking less of the churches and more of
   the Church.

   The bitter experiences of World War II have accentuated the common
   responsibilities of all the churches in the face of a resurgent
   paganism and world-wide suffering. Disciples have participated in the
   counsels of Christians on the problems of war and peace and have not
   shunned their special burdens. They raised a million-dollar emergency
   fund, furnished their quota of chaplains with the armed forces, made
   provision for their conscientious objectors. The Drake Conference on
   "The Church and the New World Mind" was part of their contribution to
   the study of postwar problems.

  Rethinking the Disciples

   The central body of opinion among Disciples cherishes the watchwords
   "union" and "restoration," about which the whole movement has
   developed. But it recognizes that changed conditions and widened
   horizons may require a reconsideration of the program of union and of
   the meaning of restoration. It is not the impatience of youth but the
   voice of experience that rejects a static and unchangeable system. J.
   H. Garrison was editor and editor emeritus of the Christian-Evangelist
   for sixty years. In the last contribution written with his own hand,
   published on April 11, 1929, being then in his eighty-eighth year, he
   wrote:

     Are we Disciples, who started out a century ago to plead for
     Christian unity, losing our zeal for this holy cause, or are we
     losing confidence in ourselves as fit instruments of our Lord for
     promoting it? I think it would be a good move for the president of
     our international convention to appoint at once a committee to study
     and report on the question: What changes in the way of addition or
     subtraction are demanded among the Disciples to make their plea more
     efficient, either in its substance or in the manner of its
     presentation to the world?

     The religious world today is very different from what it was a
     century ago. Science has given us a different conception of nature
     and of the universe. Biblical criticism has changed for most of us
     our view of the Bible, making it not a less but a more valuable book
     for the student of religion. This increase of light is evident in
     every department of knowledge. Is it possible that all these changes
     do not require any readjustment in the matter and method of a plea
     for unity inaugurated more than a century ago?

   This suggestion bore fruit, a few years later, in the appointment of a
   Commission on Restudy of the Disciples of Christ. Since 1935, this
   commission has carried on a study of the past and the present with a
   view to finding what readjustments may profitably be made for the
   future. This is only one of many groups which are concerned that the
   Disciples shall not simply be "a great people," as they sometimes
   proudly and truly claim that they are, but shall go forward to the
   fulfillment of their highest purposes. There is yet much light to break
   from God's Word and from the teachings of their own experience.
