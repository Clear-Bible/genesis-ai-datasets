                                 INTRODUCTION.

   THE present volume of St. Anselm's most important philosophical and
   theological writings contains: (1) The Proslogium (2) the Monologium,
   (3) the Cur Deus Homo, and (4) by way of historical complement, an
   Appendix to the Monologium entitled In Behalf of the Fool by Gaunilon,
   a monk of Marmoutiers. The Proslogium (which, though subsequent in
   point of time to the Monologium, is here placed first, as containing
   the famous ontological argument), the Monologium and the Appendix
   thereto were translated by Mr. Sidney Norton Deane, of New Haven,
   Conn.; the Cur Deus Homo was rendered by James Gardiner Vose, formerly
   of Milton, Conn., and later of Providence, R. I., and published in 1854
   and 1855 in the Bibliotheca Sacra, then issued at Andover, Mass., by
   Warren F. Draper. The thanks of the reading public are due to all these
   gentlemen for their gratuitous labors in behalf of philosophy.

   Welch's recent book Anselm and His Work, by its accessibility, renders
   any extended biographical notice of Anselm unneccessary. We append,
   therefore, merely a few brief paragraphs from Weber's admirable History
   of Philosophy on Anselm's position in the world of thought, and we
   afterwards add (this, at the suggestion of Prof. George M. Duncan, of
   Yale University) a series of quotations regarding Anselm's most
   characteristic contribution to philosophy--the ontological
   argument--from Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Leibnitz, Kant, Hegel,
   Dorner, Lotze, and Professor Flint. A bibliography also has been
   compiled. Thus the work will give full material and indications for the
   original study of one of the greatest exponents of Christian doctrine.

   ANSELM'S PHILOSOPHY.

   (AFTER WEBER. [1] )

   "The first really speculative thinker after Scotus is St. Anselmus, the
   disciple of Lanfranc. He was born at Aosta (1033), entered the
   monastery of Bec in Normandy (1060), succeeded Lanfranc as Abbot
   (1078), and as Archbishop of Canterbury (1093). He died in 1109. He
   left a great number of writings, the most important of which are: the
   Dialogus de grammatico, the Monologium de divinitatis essentia sive
   Exemplum de ratione fidei, the Proslogium sive Fides quoerens
   intellectum, the De veritate, the De fide trinitatis, and the Cur Deus
   Homo?

   "The second Augustine, as St. Anselmus had been called, starts out from
   the same principle as the first; he holds that faith precedes all
   reflection and all discussion concerning religious things. The
   unbelievers, he says, strive to understand because they do not believe;
   we, on the contrary, strive to understand because we believe. They and
   we have the same object in view; but inasmuch as they do not believe,
   they cannot arrive at their goal, which is to understand the dogma. The
   unbeliever will never understand. In religion faith plays the part
   played by experience in the understanding of the things of this world.
   The blind man cannot see the light, and therefore does not understand
   it; the deaf-mute, who has never perceived sound, cannot have a clear
   idea of sound. Similarly, not to believe means not to perceive, and not
   to perceive means not to understand. Hence, we do not reflect in order
   that we may believe; on the contrary, we believe in order that we may
   arrive at knowledge. A Christian ought never to doubt the beliefs and
   teachings of the Holy Catholic Church. All he can do is to strive, as
   humbly as possible, to understand her teachings by believing them, to
   love them, and resolutely to observe them in his daily life. Should he
   succeed in understanding the Christian doctrine, let him render thanks
   to God, the source of all intelligence! In case he fails, that is no
   reason why he should obstinately attack the dogma, but a reason why he
   should bow his head in worship. Faith ought not merely to be the
   starting-point,--the Christian's aim is not to depart from faith but to
   remain in it,--but also the fixed rule and goal of thought, the
   beginning, the middle, and the end of all philosophy.

   "The above almost literal quotations might give one the impression that
   St. Anselmus belongs exclusively to the history of theology. Such is
   not the case, however. This fervent Catholic is more independent, more
   of an investigator and philosopher than he himself imagines. He is a
   typical scholastic doctor and a fine exponent of the alliance between
   reason and faith which forms the characteristic trait of mediaeval
   philosophy. He assumes, a priori, that revelation and reason are in
   perfect accord. These two manifestations of one and the same Supreme
   Intelligence cannot possibly contradict each other. Hence, his point of
   view is diametrically opposed to the credo quia absurdum. Moreover, he
   too had been besieged by doubt. Indeed, the extreme ardor which impels
   him to search everywhere for arguments favorable to the dogma, is a
   confession on his part that the dogma needs support, that it is
   debatable, that it lacks self-evidence, the criterion of truth. Even as
   a monk, it was his chief concern to find a simple and conclusive
   argument in support of the existence of God and of all the doctrines of
   the Church concerning the Supreme Being. Mere affirmation did not
   satisfy him; he demanded proofs. This thought was continually before
   his mind; it caused him to forget his meals, and pursued him even
   during the solemn moments of worship. He comes to the conclusion that
   it is a temptation of Satan, and seeks deliverance from it. But in
   vain. After a night spent in meditation, he at last discovers what be
   has been seeking for years: the incontrovertible argument in favor of
   the Christian dogma, and he regards himself as fortunate in having
   found, not only the proof of the existence of God, but his peace of
   soul. His demonstrations are like the premises of modern rationalism.

   "Everything that exists, he says, has its cause, and this cause may be
   one or many. If it is one, then we have what we are looking for: God,
   the unitary being to whom all other beings owe their origin. If it is
   manifold, there are three possibilities: (1) The manifold may depend on
   unity as its cause; or (2) Each thing composing the manifold may be
   self-caused; or (3) Each thing may owe its existence to all the other
   things. The first case is identical with the hypothesis that everything
   proceeds from a single cause; for to depend on several causes, all of
   which depend on a single cause, means to depend on this single cause.
   In the second case, we must assume that there is a power, force, or
   faculty of self-existence common to all the particular causes assumed
   by the hypothesis; a power in which all participate and are comprised.
   But that would give us what we had in the first case, an absolute
   unitary cause. The third supposition, which makes each of the first
   causes' depend on all the rest, is absurd; for we cannot hold that a
   thing has for its cause and condition of existence a thing of which it
   is itself the cause and condition. Hence we are compelled to believe in
   a being which is the cause of every existing thing, without being
   caused by anything itself, and which for that very reason is infinitely
   more perfect than anything else: it is the most real (ens realissimum),
   most powerful, and best being. Since it does not depend on any being or
   on any condition of existence other than itself it is a se and per se;
   it exists, not because something else exists, but it exists because it
   exists; that is, it exists necessarily, it is necessary being.

   "It would be an easy matter to deduce pantheism from the arguments of
   the Monologium. Anselmus, it is true, protests against such an
   interpretation of his theology. With St. Augustine he assumes that the
   world is created ex nihilo. But though accepting this teaching, he
   modifies it. Before the creation, he says, things did not exist by
   themselves, independently of God; hence we say they were derived from
   non-being. But they existed eternally for God and in God, as ideas;
   they existed before their creation in the sense that the Creator
   foresaw them and predestined them for existence.

   "The existence of God, the unitary and absolute cause of the world,
   being proved, the question is to determine his nature and attributes.
   God's perfections are like human perfections; with this difference,
   however, that they are essential to him, which is not the case with us.
   Man has received a share of certain perfections, but there is no
   necessary correlation between him and these perfections; it would have
   been possible for him not to receive them; he could have existed
   without them. God, on the contrary, does not get his perfections from
   without: he has not received them, and we cannot say that he has them;
   he is and must be everything that these perfections imply; his
   attributes are identical with his essence. Justice, an attribute of
   God, and God are not two separate things. We cannot say of God that he
   has justice or goodness; we cannot even say that be is just; for to be
   just is to participate in justice after the manner of creatures. God is
   justice as such, goodness as such, wisdom as such, happiness as such,
   truth as such, being as such. Moreover, all of God's attributes
   constitute but a single attribute, by virtue of the unity of his
   essence (unum est quidquid essentialiter de summa substantia dicitur).

   "All this is pure Platonism. But, not content with spiritualising
   theism, Anselmus really discredits it when, like a new Carneades, he
   enumerates the difficulties which he finds in the conception. God is a
   simple being and at the same time eternal, that is, diffused over
   infinite points of time; he is omnipresent, that is, distributed over
   all points of space. Shall we say that God is omnipresent and eternal?
   This proposition contradicts the notion of the simplicity of the divine
   essence. Shall we say that he is nowhere in space and nowhere in time?
   But that would be equivalent to denying his existence. Let us therefore
   reconcile these two extremes and say that God is omnipresent and
   eternal, without being limited by space or time. The following is an
   equally serious difficulty: In God there is no change and consequently
   nothing accidental. Now, there is no substance without accidents. Hence
   God is not a substance; he transcends all substance. Anselmus is
   alarmed at these dangerous consequences of his logic, and he therefore
   prudently adds that, though the term substance' may be incorrect, it
   is, nevertheless, the best we can apply to God--si quid digne dici
   potest --and that to avoid or condemn it might perhaps jeopardise our
   faith in the reality of the Divine Being.

   "The most formidable theological antinomy is the doctrine of the
   trinity of persons in the unity of the divine essence. The Word is the
   object of eternal thought; it is God in so far as he is thought,
   conceived, or comprehended by himself. The Holy Spirit is the love of
   God for the Word, and of the Word for God, the love which God bears
   himself. But is this explanation satisfactory? And does it not
   sacrifice the dogma which it professes to explain to the conception of
   unity? St. Anselmus sees in the Trinity and the notion of God
   insurmountable difficulties and contradictions, which the human mind
   cannot reconcile. In his discouragement be is obliged to confess, with
   Scotus Erigena, St. Augustine, and the Neo-Platonists, that no human
   word can adequately express the essence of the All-High. Even the words
   wisdom' (sapientia) and being' (essentia) are but imperfect expressions
   of what he imagines to be the essence of God. All theological phrases
   are analogies, figures of speech, and mere approximations.

   "The Proslogium sive Fides quoerens intellectum has the same aim as the
   Monologium: to prove the existence of God. Our author draws the
   elements of his argument from St. Augustine and Platonism. He sets out
   from the idea of a perfect being, from which he infers the existence of
   such a being. We have in ourselves, he says, the idea of an absolutely
   perfect being. Now, perfection implies existence. Hence God exists.
   This argument, which has been termed the ontological argument, found an
   opponent worthy of Anselmus in Gaunilo, a monk of Marmoutiers in
   Touraine. Gaunilo emphasises the difference between thought and being,
   and points out the fact that we may conceive and imagine a being, and
   yet that being may not exist. We have as much right to conclude from
   our idea of an enchanted island in the middle of the ocean that such an
   island actually exists. The criticism is just. Indeed, the ontological
   argument would be conclusive, only in case the idea of God and the
   existence of God in the human mind were identical. If our idea of God
   is God himself, it is evident that this idea is the immediate and
   incontrovertible proof of the existence of God. But what the theologian
   aims to prove is not the existence of the God-Idea of Plato and Hegel,
   but the existence of the personal God. However that may be, we hardly
   know what to admire most, --St. Anselmus's broad and profound
   conception, or the sagacity of his opponent who, in the seclusion of
   his cell, anticipates the Transcendental Dialectic of Kant.

   "The rationalistic tendency which we have just noticed in the
   Monologium and the Proslogium meets us again in the Cur Deus Homo? Why
   did God become man? The first word of the title sufficiently indicates
   the philosophical trend of the treatise. The object is to search for
   the causes of the incarnation. The incarnation, according to St.
   Anselmus, necessarily foIlows from the necessity of redemption. Sin is
   an offence against the majesty of God. In spite of his goodness, God
   cannot pardon sin without compounding with honor and justice. On the
   other hand, he cannot revenge himself on man for his offended honor;
   for sin is an offence of infinite degree and therefore demands infinite
   satisfaction; which means that he must either destroy humanity or
   inflict upon it the eternal punishments of hell. Now, in either case,
   the goal of creation, the happiness of his creatures, would be missed
   and the honor of the Creator compromised. There is but one way for God
   to escape this dilemma without affecting his honor, and that is to
   arrange for some kind of satisfaction. He must have infinite
   satisfaction, because the offence is immeasurable. Now, in so far as
   man is a finite being and incapable of satisfying divine justice in an
   infinite measure, the infinite being himself must take the matter in
   charge; he must have recourse to substitution. Hence, the necessity of
   the incarnation. God becomes man in Christ; Christ suffers and dies in
   our stead; thus he acquires an infinite merit and the right to an
   equivalent recompense. But since the world belongs to the Creator, and
   nothing can be added to its treasures, the recompense which by right
   belongs to Christ falls to the lot of the human race in which he is
   incorporated: humanity is pardoned, forgiven, and saved.

   "Theological criticism has repudiated Anselmus's theory, which bears
   the stamp of the spirit of chivalry and of feudal customs. But,
   notwithstanding the attacks of a superficial rationalism, there is an
   abiding element of truth in it: over and above each personal and
   variable will there is an absolute, immutable, and incorruptible will,
   called justice, honor, and duty, in conformity with the customs of the
   times."

   CRITICISMS OF ANSELM'S ONTOLOGICAL

   ARGUMENT FOR THE BEING OF GOD.
     __________________________________________________________________

   DESCARTES [2] ^

   "But now, if from the simple fact that I can draw from my thought the
   idea of anything it follows that all that I recognise clearly and
   distinctly to pertain to this thing pertains to it in reality, can I
   not draw from this an argument and a demonstration of the existence of
   God? It is certain that I do not find in me the less the idea of him,
   that is, of a being supremely perfect, than that of any figure or of
   any number whatever; and I do not know less clearly and distinctly that
   an actual and eternal existence belongs to his nature than I know that
   all that I can demonstrate of any figure or of any number belongs truly
   to the nature of that figure or that number: and accordingly, although
   all that I have concluded in the preceding meditations may not turn out
   to be true, the existence of God ought to pass in my mind as being at
   least as certain as I have up to this time regarded the truths of
   mathematics to be, which have to do only with numbers and figures:
   although, indeed, that might not seem at first to be perfectly evident,
   but might appear to have some appearance of sophistry. For being
   accustomed in all other things to make a distinction between existence
   and essence, I easily persuade myself that existence may perhaps be
   separated from the essence of God, and thus God might be conceived as
   not existent actually. But nevertheless, when I think more attentively,
   I find that existence can no more be separated from the essence of God
   than from the essence of a rectilinear triangle can be separated the
   equality of its three angles to two right angles, or, indeed, if you
   please, from the idea of a mountain the idea of a valley; so that there
   would be no less contradiction in conceiving of a God--that is, of a
   being supremely perfect, to whom existence was wanting, that is to say,
   to whom there was wanting any perfection--than in conceiving of a
   mountain which had no valley.

   "But although, in reality, I might not be able to conceive of a God
   without existence, no more than of a mountain without a valley,
   nevertheless, as from the simple fact that I conceive a mountain with a
   valley, it does not follow that there exists any mountain in the world,
   so likewise, although I conceive God as existent, it does not follow,
   it seems, from that, that God exists, for my thought does not impose
   any necessity on things; and as there is nothing to prevent my
   imagining a winged horse, although there is none which has wings, so I
   might, perhaps, be able to attribute existence to God, although there
   might not be any God which existed. So far from this being so, it is
   just here under the appearance of this objection that a sophism lies
   hid; for from the fact that I cannot conceive a mountain without a
   valley, it does not follow that there exists in the world any mountain
   or any valley, but solely that the mountain and the valley, whether
   they exist or not, are inseparable from one another; whereas from the
   fact alone that I cannot conceive God except as existent, it follows
   that existence is inseparable from him, and, consequently, that he
   exists in reality; not that my thought can make it to be so, or that it
   can impose any necessity upon things; but on the contrary the necessity
   which is in the thing itself, that is to say, the necessity of the
   existence of God, determines me to have this thought.

   "For it is not at my will to conceive of a God without existence, that
   is to say, a being supremely perfect without a supreme perfection, as
   it is at my will to conceive a horse with wings or without wings.

   "And it must not also be said here that it is necessarily true that I
   should affirm that God exists, after I have supposed him to possess all
   kinds of perfection, since existence is one of these, but that my first
   supposition is not necessary, no more than it is necessary to affirm
   that all figures of four sides may be inscribed in the circle, but
   that, supposing I had this thought, I should be constrained to admit
   that the rhombus can be inscribed there, since it is a figure of four
   sides, and thus I should be constrained to admit something false. One
   ought not, I say, to allege this; for although it may not be necessary
   that I should ever fall to thinking about God, nevertheless, when it
   happens that I think upon a being first and supreme, and draw, so to
   speak, the idea of him from the store-house of mind, it is necessary
   that I attribute to him every sort of perfection, although I may not go
   on to enumerate them all, and give attention to each one in particular.
   And this necessity is sufficient to bring it about (as soon as I
   recognise that I should next conclude that existence is a perfection)
   that this first and supreme being exists: while, just as it is not
   necessary that I ever imagine a triangle, but whenever I choose to
   consider a rectilinear figure, composed solely of three angles, it is
   absolutely necessary that I attribute to it all the things which serve
   for the conclusion that there three angles are not greater than two
   right angles, although, perhaps, I did not then consider this in
   particular."

   SPINOZA [3]

   PROP. XI. God, or substance, consisting, of infinite attributes, of
   which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality, necessarily
   exists.

   "Proof.--If this be denied, conceive, if possible, that God does not
   exist: then his essence does not involve existence. But this (by Prop.
   vii.) is absurd. Therefore God necessarily exists.

   "Another Proof.--Of everything whatsoever a cause or reason must be
   assigned, either for its existence, or for its non-existence--e. g., if
   a triangle exist, a reason or cause must be granted for its existence;
   if, on the contrary, it does not exist, a cause must also be granted,
   which prevents it from existing, or annuls its existence. This reason
   or cause must either be contained in the nature of the thing in
   question, or be external to it. For instance, the reason for the
   non-existence of a square circle is indicated in its nature, namely,
   because it would involve a contradiction. On the other hand, the
   existence of substance follows also solely from its nature, inasmuch as
   its nature involves existence. (See Prop. vii.)

   "But the reason for the existence of a triangle or a circle does not
   follow from the nature of those figures, but from the order of
   universal nature in extension. From the latter it must follow, either
   that a triangle necessarily exists, or that it is impossible that it
   should exist. So much is self-evident. It follows therefrom that a
   thing necessarily exists, if no cause or reason be granted which
   prevents its existence.

   "If, then, no cause or reason can be given, which prevents the
   existence of God, or which destroys his existence, we must certainly
   conclude that he necessarily does exist. If such a reason or cause
   should be given, it must either be drawn from the very nature of God,
   or be external to him--that is, drawn from another substance of another
   nature. For if it were of the same nature, God, by that very fact,
   would be admitted to exist. But substance of another nature could have
   nothing in common with God (by Prop. ii.), and therefore would be
   unable either to cause or to destroy his existence.

   "As, then, a reason or cause which would annul the divine existence
   cannot be drawn from anything external to the divine nature, such cause
   must perforce, if God does not exist, be drawn from God's own nature,
   which would involve a contradiction. To make such an affirmation about
   a being absolutely infinite and supremely perfect, is absurd;
   therefore, neither in the nature of God, nor externally to his nature,
   can a cause or reason be assigned which would annul his existence.
   Therefore, God necessarily exists. Q. E. D.

   "Another proof.--The potentiality of non-existence is a negation of
   power, and contrariwise the potentiality of existence is a power, as is
   obvious. If, then, that which necessarily exists is nothing but finite
   beings, such finite beings are more powerful than a being absolutely
   infinite, which is obviously absurd; therefore, either nothing exists,
   or else a being absolutely infinite necessarily exists also. Now we
   exist either in ourselves, or in something else which necessarily
   exists (see Axiom i. and Prop. vii.). Therefore a being absolutely
   infinite--in other words, God (Def. vi.)--necessarily exists. Q. E. D.

   "Note.--In this last proof, I have purposely shown God's existence a
   posteriori, so that the proof might be more easily followed, not
   because, from the same premises, God's existence does not follow a
   priori. For, as the potentiality of existence is a power, it follows
   that, in proportion as reality increases in the nature of a thing, so
   also will it increase its strength for existence. Therefore a being
   absolutely infinite, such as God, has from himself an absolutely
   infinite power of existence, and hence he does absolutely exist.
   Perhaps there will be many who will be unable to see the force of this
   proof, inasmuch as they are accustomed only to consider those things
   which flow from external causes. Of such things, they see that those
   which quickly come to pass--that is, quickly come into
   existence--quickly also disappear; whereas they regard as more
   difficult of accomplishment--that is, not so easily brought into
   existence --those things which they conceive as more complicated.

   "However, to do away with this misconception, I need not here show the
   measure of truth in the proverb, What comes quickly, goes quickly,' nor
   discuss whether, from the point of view of universal nature, all things
   are equally easy, or otherwise: I need only remark, that I am not here
   speaking of things, which come to pass through causes external to
   themselves, but only of substances which (by Prop. vi.) cannot be
   produced by any external cause. Things which are produced by external
   causes, whether they consist of many parts or few, owe whatsoever
   perfection or reality they possess solely to the efficacy of their
   external cause, and therefore their existence arises solely from the
   perfection by their external cause, not from their own. Contrariwise,
   whatsoever perfection is possessed by substance is due to no external
   cause; wherefore the existence of substance must arise solely from its
   own nature, which is nothing else but its essence. Thus, the perfection
   of a thing does not annul its existence, but, on the contrary, asserts
   it. Imperfection, on the other hand, does annul it; therefore we cannot
   be more certain of the existence of anything, than of the existence of
   a being absolutely infinite or perfect--that is, of God. For inasmuch
   as his essence excludes all imperfection, and involves absolute
   perfection, all cause for doubt concerning his existence is done away,
   and the utmost certainty on the question is given. This, I think, will
   be evident to every moderately attentive reader."

   LOCKE [4]

   "Our idea of a most perfect being, not the sole proof of a God.--How
   far the idea of a most perfect being which a man may frame in his mind,
   does or does not prove the existence of a God, I will not here examine.
   For, in the different make of men's tempers, and application of their
   thoughts, some arguments prevail more on one, and some on another, for
   the confirmation of the same truth. But yet, I think this I may say,
   that it is an ill way of establishing this truth and silencing
   atheists, to lay the whole stress of so important a point as this upon
   that sole foundation: and take some men's having that idea of God in
   their minds (for it is evident some men have none, and some worse than
   none, and the most very different) for the only proof of a Deity; and
   out of an over-fondness of that darling invention, cashier, or at least
   endeavor to invalidate, all other arguments, and forbid us to hearken
   to those proofs, as being weak or fallacious, which our own existence
   and the sensible parts of the universe offer so clearly and cogently to
   our thoughts, that I deem it impossible for a considering man to
   withstand them."

   "Although I am for innate ideas, and in particular for that of God, I
   do not think that the demonstrations of the Cartesians drawn from the
   idea of God are perfect. I have shown fully elsewhere (in the Actes de
   Leipsic, and in the Memoires de Trevoux) that what Descartes has
   borrowed from Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, is very beautiful and
   really very ingenious, but that there is still a gap therein to be
   filled. This celebrated archbishop, who was without doubt one of the
   most able men of his time, congratulates himself, not without reason,
   for having discovered a means of proving the existence of God a priori,
   by means of its own notion, without recurring to its effects. And this
   is very nearly the force of his argument: God is the greatest or (as
   Descartes says) the most perfect of beings, or rather a being of
   supreme grandeur and perfection, including all degrees thereof. That is
   the notion of God. See now how existence follows from this notion. To
   exist is something more than not to exist, or rather, existence adds a
   degree to grandeur and perfection, and as Descartes states it,
   existence is itself a perfection. Therefore this degree of grandeur and
   perfection, or rather this perfection which consists in existence, is
   in this supreme all-great, all-perfect being: for otherwise some degree
   would be wanting to it, contrary to its definition. Consequently this
   supreme being exists. The Scholastics, not excepting even their Doctor
   Angelicus, have misunderstood this argument, and have taken it as a
   paralogism; in which respect they were altogether wrong, and Descartes,
   who studied quite a long time the scholastic philosophy at the Jesuit
   College of La Fleche, had great reason for re-establishing it. It is
   not a paralogism, but it is an imperfect demonstration, which assumes
   something that must still be proved in order to render it
   mathematically evident; that is, it is tacitly assumed that this idea
   of the all-great or all-perfect being is possible, and implies no
   contradiction. And it is already something that by this remark it is
   proved that, assuming that God is Possible, he exists, which is the
   privilege of divinity alone. We have the right to presume the
   possibility of every being, and especially that of God, until some one
   proves the contrary. So that this metaphysical argument already gives a
   morally demonstrative conclusion, which declares that according to the
   present state of our knowledge we must judge that God exists, and act
   in conformity thereto. But it is to be desired, nevertheless, that
   clever men achieve the demonstration with the strictness of a
   mathematical proof, and I think I have elsewhere said something that
   may serve this end."

   KANT [6]

   "Being is evidently not a real predicate, or a concept of something
   that can be added to the concept of a thing. It is merely the admission
   of a thing, and of certain determinations in it. Logically, it is
   merely the copula of a judgment. The proposition, God is almighty,
   contains two concepts, each having its object, namely, God and
   almightiness. The small word is, is not an additional predicate, but
   only serves to put the predicate in relation to the subject. If, then,
   I take the subject (God) with all its predicates (including that of
   almightiness), and say, God is, or there is a God, I do not put a new
   predicate to the concept of God, but I only put the subject by itself,
   with all its predicates, in relation to my concept, as its object. Both
   must contain exactly the same kind of thing, and nothing can have been
   added to the concept, which expresses possibility only, by my thinking
   its object as simply, given and saying, it is. And thus the real does
   not contain more than the possible. A hundred real dollars do not
   contain a penny more than a hundred possible dollars. For as the latter
   signify the concept, the former the object and its position by itself,
   it is clear that, in case the former contained more than the latter, my
   concept would not express the whole object, and would not therefore be
   its adequate concept. In my financial position no doubt there exists
   more by one hundred real dollars, than by their concept only (that is
   their possibility), because in reality the object is not only contained
   analytically in my concept, but is added to my concept (which is a
   determination of my state), synthetically: but the conceived hundred
   dollars are not in the least increased through the existence which is
   outside my concept.

   "By whatever and by however many predicates I may think a thing (even
   in completely determining it), nothing is really added to it, if I add
   that the thing exists. Otherwise, it would not be the same that exists,
   but something more than was contained in the concept, and I could not
   say that the exact object of my concept existed. Nay, even if I were to
   think in a thing all reality, except one, that one missing reality
   would not be supplied by my saying that so defective a thing exists,
   but it would exist with the same defect with which I thought it; or
   what exists would be different from what I thought. If, then, I try to
   conceive a being, as the highest reality (without any defect), the
   question still remains, whether it exists or not. For though in my
   concept there may be wanting nothing of the possible real content of a
   thing in general, something is wanting in its relation to my whole
   state of thinking, namely, that the knowledge of that object should be
   possible a posteriori also. And here we perceive the cause of our
   difficulty. If we were concerned with an object of our senses, I could
   not mistake the existence of a thing for the mere concept of it; for by
   the concept the object is thought as only in harmony with the general
   conditions of a possible empirical knowledge, while by its existence it
   is thought as contained in the whole content of experience. Through
   this connection with the content of the whole experience, the concept
   of an object is not in the least increased; our thought has only
   received through it one more possible perception. If, however, we are
   thinking existence through the pure category alone, we need not wonder
   that we cannot find any characteristic to distinguish it from mere
   possibility.

   "Whatever, therefore, our concept of an object may contain, we must
   always step outside it, in order to attribute to it existence. With
   objects of the senses, this takes place through their connection with
   any one of my perceptions, according to empirical laws; with objects of
   pure thought, however, there is no means of knowing their existence,
   because it would have to be known entirely a priori, while our
   consciousness of every kind of existence, whether immediately by
   perception, or by conclusions which connect something with perception,
   belongs entirely to the unity of experience, and any existence outside
   that field, though it cannot be declared to be absolutely impossible,
   is a presupposition that cannot be justified by anything.

   "The concept of a Supreme Being is, in many respects, a very useful
   idea, but, being an idea only, it is quite incapable of increasing, by
   itself alone, our knowledge with regard to what exists. It cannot even
   do so much as to inform us any further as to its possibility. The
   analytical characteristic of possibility, which consists in the absence
   of contradiction in mere positions (realities), cannot be denied to it;
   but the connection of all real properties in one and the same thing is
   a synthesis the possibility of which we cannot judge a priori because
   these realities are not given to us as such, and because, even if this
   were so, no judgment whatever takes place, it being necessary to look
   for the characteristic of the possibility of synthetical knowledge in
   experience only, to which the object of an idea can never belong. Thus
   we see that the celebrated Leibnitz is far from having achieved what we
   thought he had, namely, to understand a priori the possibility of so
   sublime an ideal Being.

   "Time and labor therefore are lost on the famous ontological
   (Cartesian) proof of the existence of a Supreme Being from mere
   concepts; and a man might as well imagine that he could become richer
   in knowledge by mere ideas, as a merchant in capital, if, in order to
   improve his position, he were to add a few noughts to his cash
   account."

   HEGEL [7]

   "This proof was included among the various proofs up to the time of
   Kant, and--by some who have not yet reached the Kantian standpoint--it
   is so included even to the present day. It is different from what we
   find and read of amongst the ancients. For it was said that God is
   absolute thought as objective; for because things in the world are
   contingent, they are not the truth in and for itself--but this is found
   in the infinite. The scholastics also knew well from the Aristotelian
   philosophy the metaphysical proposition that potentiality is nothing by
   itself, but is clearly one with actuality. Later, on the other hand,
   the opposition between thought itself and Being began to appear with
   Anselm. It is noteworthy that only now for the first time through the
   Middle Ages and in Christianity, the universal Notion and Being, as it
   is to ordinary conception, became established in this pure abstraction
   as these infinite extremes; and thus the highest law has come to
   consciousness. But we reach our profoundest depths in bringing the
   highest opposition into consciousness. Only no advance was made beyond
   the division as such, although Anselm also tried to find the connection
   between the sides. But while hitherto God appeared as the absolute
   existent, and the universal was attributed to Him as predicate, an
   opposite order begins with Anselm--Being becomes predicate, and the
   absolute Idea is first of all established as the subject, but the
   subject of thought. Thus if the existence of God is once abandoned as
   the first hypothesis, and established as a result of thought,
   self-consciousness is on the way to turn back within itself. Then we
   have the question coming in, Does God exist? while on the other side
   the question of most importance was, What is God?

   "The ontological proof, which is the first properly metaphysical proof
   of the existence of God, consequently came to mean that God as the Idea
   of existence which unites all reality in itself, also has the reality
   of existence within Himself; this proof thus follows from the Notion of
   God, that He is the universal essence of all essence. The drift of this
   reasoning is, according to Anselm (Proslogium, C. 2), as follows: It is
   one thing to say that a thing is in the understanding, and quite
   another to perceive that it exists. Even an ignorant person (insipiens)
   will thus be quite convinced that in thought there is something beyond
   which nothing greater can be thought ; for when he hears this he
   understands it, and everything that is understood is in the
   understanding. But that beyond which nothing greater can be thought
   cannot certainly be in the understanding alone. For if it is accepted
   as in thought alone, we may go on farther to accept it as existent;
   that, however, is something greater' than what is merely thought. Thus
   were that beyond which nothing greater can be thought merely in the
   understanding, that beyond which nothing greater can be thought would
   be something beyond which something greater can be thought. But that is
   truly impossible; there thus without doubt exists both in the
   understanding and in reality something beyond which nothing greater can
   be thought.' The highest conception cannot be in the understanding
   alone; it is essential that it should exist. Thus it is made clear that
   Being is in a superficial way subsumed under the universal of reality,
   that to this extent Being does not enter into opposition with the
   Notion. That is quite right; only the transition is not
   demonstrated--that the subjective understanding abrogates itself. This,
   however, is just the question which gives the whole interest to the
   matter. When reality or completion is expressed in such a way that it
   is not yet posited as existent, it is something thought, and rather
   opposed to Being than that this is subsumed under it.

   "This mode of arguing held good until the time of Kant; and we see in
   it the endeavor to apprehend the doctrine of the Church through reason.
   This opposition between Being and thought is the starting-point in
   philosophy, the absolute that contains the two opposites within
   itself--a conception, according to Spinoza, which involves its
   existence likewise. Of Anselm it is however to be remarked that the
   formal logical mode of the understanding, the process of scholastic
   reasoning is to be found in him; the content indeed is right, but the
   form faulty. For in the first place the expression the thought of a
   Highest' is assumed as prius. Secondly, there are two sorts of objects
   of thought--one that is and another that is not; the object that is
   only thought and does not exist, is as imperfect as that which only is
   without being thought. The third point is that what is highest must
   likewise exist. But what is highest, the standard to which all else
   must conform, must be no mere hypothesis, as we find it represented in
   the conception of a highest acme of perfection, as a content which is
   thought and likewise is. This very content, the unity of Being and
   thought, is thus indeed the true content, but because Anselm has it
   before him only in the form of the understanding, the opposites are
   identical and conformable to unity in a third determination only--the
   Highest--which, in as far as it is regulative, is outside of them. In
   this it is involved that we should first of all have subjective
   thought, and then distinguished from that, Being. We allow that if we
   think a content (and it is apparently indifferent whether this is God
   or any other), it may be the case that this content does not exist. The
   assertion Something that is thought does not exist' is now subsumed
   under the above standard and is not conformable to it. We grant that
   the truth is that which is not merely thought but which likewise is.
   But of this opposition nothing here is said. Undoubtedly God would be
   imperfect, if He were merely thought and did not also have the
   determination of Being. But in relation to God we must not take thought
   as merely subjective; thought here signifies the absolute, pure
   thought, and thus we must ascribe to Him the quality of Being. On the
   other hand if God were merely Being, if He were not conscious of
   Himself as self-consciousness, He would not be Spirit, a thought that
   thinks itself.

   "Kant, on the other hand, attacked and rejected Anselm's proof--which
   rejection the whole world afterwards followed up--on the ground of its
   being an assumption that the unity of Being and thought is the highest
   perfection. What Kant thus demonstrates in the present day--that Being
   is different from thought and that Being is not by any means posited
   with thought--was a criticism offered even in that time by a monk named
   Gaunilo. He combated this proof of Anselm's in a Liber pro insipiente
   to which Anselm himself directed a reply in his Liber apologeticus
   adversus insipientem. Thus Kant says (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, P.
   464 of the sixth edition): If we think a hundred dollars, this
   conception does not involve existence. That is certainly true: what is
   only a conception does not exist, but it is likewise not a true
   content, for what does not exist, is merely an untrue conception. Of
   such we do not however here speak, but of pure thought; it is nothing
   new to say they are different--Anselm knew this just as well as we do.
   God is the infinite, just as body and soul, Being and thought are
   eternally united; this is the speculative, true definition of God. To
   the proof which Kant criticises in a manner which it is the fashion to
   follow now-a-days, there is thus lacking only the perception of the
   unity of thought and of existence in the infinite; and this alone must
   form the commencement."

   J. A. DORNER [8]

   "According to the Monologium, we arrive at the mental representation of
   God by the agency of faith and conscience, therefore by a combined
   religious and moral method; by the same means we arrive at the
   representation of the relativity of the world. But as there seemed to
   Anselm something inadequate in making the Being of the Absolute
   dependent upon the existence of the Relative, as if the latter were
   more certain than the former, he has interpolated in the Proslogium
   (Alloquium Dei) the Ontological method. The thought of God, which is
   always given, and the being of which is to be proved, claims, at any
   rate, to be the highest thought possible; indeed, upon close comparison
   with all other thoughts which come and go, with thoughts of such things
   as may just as well not exist as exist, it has the essential
   peculiarity, the prerogative, so to speak,--and this is Anselm's
   discovery,--that, if it is actually thought of as the highest
   conceivable thought, it is also thought of as existent. Were it not
   thought of as being, it would not for a moment be actually thought.
   Anselm then proceeds with his proof as follows: We believe Thou art
   something, beyond which nothing greater can be thought. The fool (Ps.
   xiv.) denies the existence of such a Being. Is He therefore
   non-existent? But the very fool hears and understands what I say,
   "something, greater than which there is nothing," and what he
   understands is in his understanding. That it also exists without him
   would thus have to be proved. But that, beyond which nothing greater
   can be thought, cannot exist in mere intellect. For did it exist only
   in intellect, the thought might be framed that it was realised, and
   that would be a greater thought. Consequently, were that, a greater
   than which cannot be thought, existent in mere intellect, the thought
   quo majus cogitari non potest would at the same time be quo majus
   cogitari potest, which is impossible. Consequently, there exists, in
   reality as well as in the understanding, something a greater than which
   cannot be thought. And this is so true that its non-existence cannot be
   thought. Something may be thought which is only to be thought as
   existent, and that is a majus than that the non-existence of which may
   be thought, and that Thou art, O Lord, my God, I must think though I
   did not believe.' The nerve of the Anselmic argument lies therefore in
   the notion that an idea which has an objective existence is a majus
   than that to which mere subjective existence appertains; that,
   consequently, as under the idea of God the highest thought possible is
   at any rate expressed, the idea of God is not thought unless it is
   thought as existent. For, he says in another place, it may be thought
   of everything that it does not exist, with the exception of that quod
   summe est to which being pre-eminently belongs. That is, the
   non-existence may be thought of everything which has beginning or end,
   or which is constituted of parts and is nowhere whole. But that, and it
   alone, cannot be thought as non-existent which has neither beginning
   nor end, and is not constituted of parts, but is thought of as
   everywhere existing whole. Gaunilo, Count of Montigny, makes a twofold
   answer in defence of the atheist. He says that that highest essence has
   no being in the understanding; it only exists therein by the ear, not
   by being; it only exists as a man who has heard a sound endeavors to
   embrace a thing wholly unknown to him in an image. And therein, he
   says, it is concluded that the mental representation of God in mankind
   is already a purely contingent one, and is produced from without by the
   sound of words; its necessary presence in the spirit is not proved.
   Thus, he adds, much is wanting to the ability of inferring its
   existence from the finding of such an image in the spirit. In the
   sphere of mere imagination no one thing has a less or a greater
   existence than any other thing; each has equally no existence at all.
   Therefore, he writes, granted that the presence of the idea of God in
   the spirit is not contingent, still the thought or the concept of God
   does not essentially argue the being of God. Similarly says Kant later
   on: We are no richer if we think of our ability as one cipher more.'
   That Anselm also undoubtedly knew, but he opined that the concept of
   God is different to any other thought, which remains unaltered, whether
   it is thought of as existent or non-existent; the concept of God is
   that thought, which is no longer thought unless it is thought as
   existent, and which, therefore, essentially involves being. But, of
   course, it is insufficiently established by Anselm that a concept of
   God which does not necessarily include existence, is not the highest
   thought, and therefore is not the concept of God, and that,
   consequently, the really highest thought must also be thought of as
   existent. To this the following objection attaches. Inasmuch as Anselm
   treated existence as a majus compared with non-existence, he treated
   existence as an attribute, whereas it is the bearer of all attributes.
   So it is not proved by Anselm that the origin of this idea, which, when
   thought, is thought as existent, is not contingent to the reason, but
   necessary; and that reason only remains reason by virtue of this idea.
   Finally, Anselm thinks, thus overrating the Ontological moment, that he
   has already attained therein the full concept of God. These
   shortcomings were to be obviated, stage by stage, by his successors."

   LOTZE [9]

   "To conclude that because the notion of a most perfect Being includes
   reality as one of its perfections, therefore a most perfect Being
   necessarily exists, is so obviously to conclude falsely, that after
   Kant's incisive refutation any attempt to defend such reasoning would
   be useless. Anselm, in his more free and spontaneous reflection, has
   here and there touched the thought that the greatest which we can
   think, if we think it as only thought, is less than the same greatest
   if we think it as existent. It is not possible that from this
   reflection either any one should develop a logically cogent proof, but
   the way in which it is put seems to reveal another fundamental thought
   which is seeking for expression. For what would it matter if that which
   is thought as most perfect were, as thought, less than the least
   reality? Why should this thought disturb us? Plainly for this reason,
   that it is an immediate certainty that what is greatest, most
   beautiful, most worthy is not a mere thought, but must be a reality,
   because it would be intolerable to believe of our ideal that it is an
   idea produced by the action of thought but having no existence, no
   power, and no validity in the world of reality. We do not from the
   perfection of that which is perfect immediately deduce its reality as a
   logical consequence; but without the circumlocution of a deduction we
   directly feel the impossibility of its non-existence, and all semblance
   of syllogistic proof only serves to make more clear the directness of
   this certainty. If what is greatest did not exist, then what is
   greatest would not be, and it is not impossible that that which is
   greatest of all conceivable things should not be."

   PROFESSOR ROBERT FLINT [10]

   "Anselm was the founder of that kind of argumentation which, in the
   opinion of many, is alone entitled to be described as a priori or
   ontological. He reasoned thus: The fool may say in his heart, There is
   no God; but he only proves thereby that he is a fool, for what he says
   is self-contradictory. Since he denies that there is a God, he has in
   his mind the idea of God, and that idea implies the existence of God,
   for it is the idea of a Being than which a higher cannot be conceived.
   That than which a higher cannot be conceived cannot exist merely as an
   idea, because what exists merely as an idea is inferior to what exists
   in reality as well as in idea. The idea of a highest Being which exists
   merely in thought, is the idea of a highest Being which is not the
   highest even in thought, but inferior to a highest Being which exists
   in fact as well as in thought.' This reasoning found unfavorable
   critics even among the contemporaries of Anselm, and has commended
   itself completely to few. Yet it may fairly be doubted whether it has
   been conclusively refuted, and some of the objections most frequently
   urged against it are certainly inadmissible. It is no answer to it, for
   example, to deny that the idea of God is innate or universal. The
   argument merely assumes that he who denies that there is a God must
   have an idea of God. There is also no force, as Anselm showed, in the
   objection of Gaunilo, that the existence of God can no more be inferred
   from the idea of a perfect being, than the existence of a perfect
   island is to be inferred from the idea of such an island. There neither
   is nor can be an idea of an island which is greater and better than any
   other that can ever be conceived. Anselm could safely promise that he
   would make Gaunilo a present of such an island when he had really
   imagined it. Only one being--an infinite, independent, necessary
   being--can be perfect in the sense of being greater and better than
   every other conceivable being. The objection that the ideal can never
   logically yield the real--that the transition from thought to fact must
   be in every instance illegitimate--is merely an assertion that the
   argument is fallacious. It is an assertion which cannot fairly be made
   until the argument has been exposed and refuted. The argument is that a
   certain thought of God is found necessarily to imply His existence. The
   objection that existence is not a predicate, and that the idea of a God
   who exists is not more complete and perfect than the idea of a God who
   does not exist, is, perhaps, not incapable of being satisfactorily
   repelled. Mere existence is not a predicate, but specifications or
   determinations of existence are predicable. Now the argument nowhere
   implies that existence is a predicate; it implies only that reality,
   necessity, and independence of existence are predicates of existence;
   and it implies this on the ground that existence in re can be
   distinguished from existence in conceptu, necessary from contingent
   existence, self-existence from derived existence. Specific distinctions
   must surely admit of being predicated. That the exclusion of
   existence--which here means real and necessary existence --from the
   idea of God does not leave us with an incomplete idea of God, is not a
   position, I think, which can be maintained. Take away existence from
   among the elements in the idea of a perfect being, and the idea becomes
   either the idea of a nonentity or the idea of an idea, and not the idea
   of a perfect being at all. Thus, the argument of Anselm is
   unwarrantably represented as an argument of four terms instead of
   three. Those who urge the objection seem to me to prove only that if
   our thought of God be imperfect, a being who merely realised that
   thought would be an imperfect being; but there is a vast distance
   between this truism and the paradox that an unreal being may be an
   ideally perfect being."

                              ANSELM'S PROSLOGIUM

OR DISCOURSE ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD
     __________________________________________________________________

  PREFACE.

   In this brief work the author aims at proving in a single argument the
   existence of God, and whatsoever we believe of God.--The difficulty of
   the task.--The author writes in the person of one who contemplates God,
   and seeks to understand what he believes. To this work he had given
   this title: Faith Seeking Understanding. He finally named it
   Proslogium,--that is, A Discourse.

   AFTER I had published, at the solicitous entreaties of certain
   brethren, a brief work (the Monologium) as an example of meditation on
   the grounds of faith, in the person of one who investigates, in a
   course of silent reasoning with himself, matters of which he is
   ignorant; considering that this book was knit together by the linking
   of many arguments, I began to ask myself whether there might be found a
   single argument which would require no other for its proof than itself
   alone; and alone would suffice to demonstrate that God truly exists,
   and that there is a supreme good requiring nothing else, which all
   other things require for their existence and well-being; and whatever
   we believe regarding the divine Being.

   Although I often and earnestly directed my thought to this end, and at
   some times that which I sought seemed to be just within my reach, while
   again it wholly evaded my mental vision, at last in despair I was about
   to cease, as if from the search for a thing which could not be found.
   But when I wished to exclude this thought altogether, lest, by busying
   my mind to no purpose, it should keep me from other thoughts, in which
   I might be successful; then more and more, though I was unwilling and
   shunned it, it began to force itself upon me, with a kind of
   importunity. So, one day, when I was exceedingly wearied with resisting
   its importunity, in the very conflict of my thoughts, the proof of
   which I had despaired offered itself, so that I eagerly embraced the
   thoughts which I was strenuously repelling.

   Thinking, therefore, that what I rejoiced to have found, would, if put
   in writing, be welcome to some readers, of this very matter, and of
   some others, I have written the following treatise, in the person of
   one who strives to lift his mind to the contemplation of God, and seeks
   to understand what he believes. In my judgment, neither this work nor
   the other, which I mentioned above, deserved to be called a book, or to
   bear the name of an author; and yet I thought they ought not to be sent
   forth without some title by which they might, in some sort, invite one
   into whose hands they fell to their perusal. I accordingly gave each a
   title, that the first might be known as, An Example of Meditation on
   the Grounds of Faith, and its sequel as, Faith Seeking Understanding.
   But, after, both had been copied by many under these titles, many urged
   me, and especially Hugo, the reverend Archbishop of Lyons, who
   discharges the apostolic office in Gaul, who instructed me to this
   effect on his apostolic authority--to prefix my name to these writings.
   And that this might be done more fitly, I named the first, Monologium,
   that is, A Soliloquy; but the second, Proslogium, that is, A Discourse.

  CHAPTER I.

   Exhortation of the mind to the contemplation of God.--It casts aside
   cares, and excludes all thoughts save that of God, that it may seek
   Him. Man was created to see God. Man by sin lost the blessedness for
   which he was made, and found the misery for which he was not made. He
   did not keep this good when he could keep it easily. Without God it is
   ill with us. Our labors and attempts are in vain without God. Man
   cannot seek God, unless God himself teaches him; nor find him, unless
   he reveals himself. God created man in his image, that he might be
   mindful of him, think of him, and love him. The believer does not seek
   to understand, that he may believe, but he believes that he may
   understand: for unless he believed he would not understand.

   UP now, slight man! flee, for a little while, thy occupations; hide
   thyself, for a time, from thy disturbing thoughts. Cast aside, now, thy
   burdensome cares, and put away thy toilsome business. Yield room for
   some little time to God; and rest for a little time in him. Enter the
   inner chamber of thy mind; shut out all thoughts save that of God, and
   such as can aid thee in seeking him; close thy door and seek him. Speak
   now, my whole heart! speak now to God, saying, I seek thy face; thy
   face, Lord, will I seek (Psalms xxvii. 8). And come thou now, O Lord my
   God, teach my heart where and how it may seek thee, where and how it
   may find thee.

   Lord, if thou art not here, where shall I seek thee, being absent? But
   if thou art everywhere, why do I not see thee present? Truly thou
   dwellest in unapproachable light. But where is unapproachable light, or
   how shall I come to it? Or who shall lead me to that light and into it,
   that I may see thee in it? Again, by what marks, under what form, shall
   I seek thee? I have never seen thee, O Lord, my God; I do not know thy
   form. What, O most high Lord, shall this man do, an exile far from
   thee? What shall thy servant do, anxious in his love of thee, and cast
   out afar from thy face? He pants to see thee, and thy face is too far
   from him. He longs to come to thee, and thy dwelling-place is
   inaccessible. He is eager to find thee, and knows not thy place. He
   desires to seek thee, and does not know thy face. Lord, thou art my
   God, and thou art my Lord, and never have I seen thee. It is thou that
   hast made me, and hast made me anew, and hast bestowed upon me all the
   blessing I enjoy; and not yet do I know thee. Finally, I was created to
   see thee, and not yet have I done that for which I was made.

   O wretched lot of man, when he hath lost that for which he was made! O
   hard and terrible fate! Alas, what has he lost, and what has he found?
   What has departed, and what remains? He has lost the blessedness for
   which he was made, and has found the misery for which he was not made.
   That has departed without which nothing is happy, and that remains
   which, in itself, is only miserable. Man once did eat the bread of
   angels, for which he hungers now; he eateth now the bread of sorrows,
   of which he knew not then. Alas! for the mourning of all mankind, for
   the universal lamentation of the sons of Hades! He choked with satiety,
   we sigh with hunger. He abounded, we beg. He possessed in happiness,
   and miserably forsook his possession; we suffer want in unhappiness,
   and feel a miserable longing, and alas! we remain empty.

   Why did he not keep for us, when he could so easily, that whose lack we
   should feel so heavily? Why did he shut us away from the light, and
   cover us over with darkness? With what purpose did he rob us of life,
   and inflict death upon us? Wretches that we are, whence have we been
   driven out; whither are we driven on? Whence hurled? Whither consigned
   to ruin? From a native country into exile, from the vision of God into
   our present blindness, from the joy of immortality into the bitterness
   and horror of death. Miserable exchange of how great a good, for how
   great an evil! Heavy loss, heavy grief, heavy all our fate!

   But alas! wretched that I am, one of the sons of Eve, far removed from
   God! What have I undertaken? What have I accomplished? Whither was I
   striving? How far have I come? To what did I aspire? Amid what thoughts
   am I sighing? I sought blessings, and lo! confusion. I strove toward
   God, and I stumbled on myself. I sought calm in privacy, and I found
   tribulation and grief, in my inmost thoughts. I wished to smile in the
   joy of my mind, and I am compelled to frown by the sorrow of my heart.
   Gladness was hoped for, and lo! a source of frequent sighs!

   And thou too, O Lord, how long? How long, O Lord, dost thou forget us;
   how long dost thou turn thy face from us? When wilt thou look upon us,
   and hear us? When wilt thou enlighten our eyes, and show us thy face?
   When wilt thou restore thyself to us? Look upon us, Lord; hear us,
   enlighten us, reveal thyself to us. Restore thyself to us, that it may
   be well with us,--thyself, without whom it is so ill with us. Pity our
   toilings and strivings toward thee since we can do nothing without
   thee. Thou dost invite us; do thou help us. I beseech thee, O Lord,
   that I may not lose hope in sighs, but may breathe anew in hope. Lord,
   my heart is made bitter by its desolation; sweeten thou it, I beseech
   thee, with thy consolation. Lord, in hunger I began to seek thee; I
   beseech thee that I may not cease to hunger for thee. In hunger I have
   come to thee; let me not go unfed. I have come in poverty to the Rich,
   in misery to the Compassionate; let me not return empty and despised.
   And if, before I eat, I sigh, grant, even after sighs, that which I may
   eat. Lord, I am bowed down and can only look downward; raise me up that
   I may look upward. My iniquities have gone over my head; they overwhelm
   me; and, like a heavy load, they weigh me down. Free me from them;
   unburden me, that the pit of iniquities may not close over me.

   Be it mine to look up to thy light, even from afar, even from the
   depths. Teach me to seek thee, and reveal thyself to me, when I seek
   thee, for I cannot seek thee, except thou teach me, nor find thee,
   except thou reveal thyself. Let me seek thee in longing, let me long
   for thee in seeking; let me find thee in love, and love thee in
   finding. Lord, I acknowledge and I thank thee that thou hast created me
   in this thine image, in order that I may be mindful of thee, may
   conceive of thee, and love thee; but that image has been so consumed
   and wasted away by vices, and obscured by the smoke of wrong-doing,
   that it cannot achieve that for which it was made, except thou renew
   it, and create it anew. I do not endeavor, O Lord, to penetrate thy
   sublimity, for in no wise do I compare my understanding with that; but
   I long to understand in some degree thy truth, which my heart believes
   and loves. For I do not seek to understand that I may believe, but I
   believe in order to understand. For this also I believe,--that unless I
   believed, I should not understand.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

   Truly there is a God, although the fool hath said in his heart, There
   is no God.

   AND so, Lord, do thou, who dost give understanding to faith, give me,
   so far as thou knowest it to be profitable, to understand that thou art
   as we believe; and that thou art that which we believe. And indeed, we
   believe that thou art a being than which nothing greater can be
   conceived. Or is there no such nature, since the fool hath said in his
   heart, there is no God? (Psalms xiv. 1). But, at any rate, this very
   fool, when he hears of this being of which I speak--a being than which
   nothing greater can be conceived--understands what he hears, and what
   he understands is in his understanding; although he does not understand
   it to exist.

   For, it is one thing for an object to be in the understanding, and
   another to understand that the object exists. When a painter first
   conceives of what he will afterwards perform, he has it in his
   understanding, but he does not yet understand it to be, because he has
   not yet performed it. But after he has made the painting, he both has
   it in his understanding, and he understands that it exists, because he
   has made it.

   Hence, even the fool is convinced that something exists in the
   understanding, at least, than which nothing greater can be conceived.
   For, when he hears of this, he understands it. And whatever is
   understood, exists in the understanding. And assuredly that, than which
   nothing greater can be conceived, cannot exist in the understanding
   alone. For, suppose it exists in the understanding alone: then it can
   be conceived to exist in reality; which is greater.

   Therefore, if that, than which nothing greater can be conceived, exists
   in the understanding alone, the very being, than which nothing greater
   can be conceived, is one, than which a greater can be conceived. But
   obviously this is impossible. Hence, there is no doubt that there
   exists a being, than which nothing greater can be conceived, and it
   exists both in the understanding and in reality.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

   God cannot be conceived not to exist.--God is that, than which nothing
   greater can be conceived.--That which can be conceived not to exist is
   not God.

   AND it assuredly exists so truly, that it cannot be conceived not to
   exist. For, it is possible to conceive of a being which cannot be
   conceived not to exist; and this is greater than one which can be
   conceived not to exist. Hence, if that, than which nothing greater can
   be conceived, can be conceived not to exist, it is not that, than which
   nothing greater can be conceived. But this is an irreconcilable
   contradiction. There is, then, so truly a being than which nothing
   greater can be conceived to exist, that it cannot even be conceived not
   to exist; and this being thou art, O Lord, our God.

   So truly, therefore, dost thou exist, O Lord, my God, that thou canst
   not be conceived not to exist; and rightly. For, if a mind could
   conceive of a being better than thee, the creature would rise above the
   Creator; and this is most absurd. And, indeed, whatever else there is,
   except thee alone, can be conceived not to exist. To thee alone,
   therefore, it belongs to exist more truly than all other beings, and
   hence in a higher degree than all others. For, whatever else exists
   does not exist so truly, and hence in a less degree it belongs to it to
   exist. Why, then, has the fool said in his heart, there is no God
   (Psalms xiv. 1), since it is so evident, to a rational mind, that thou
   dost exist in the highest degree of all? Why, except that he is dull
   and a fool?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

   How the fool has said in his heart what cannot be conceived.--A thing
   may be conceived in two ways: (1) when the word signifying it is
   conceived; (2) when the thing itself is understood As far as the word
   goes, God can be conceived not to exist; in reality he cannot.

   BUT how has the fool said in his heart what he could not conceive; or
   how is it that he could not conceive what he said in his heart? since
   it is the same to say in the heart, and to conceive.

   But, if really, nay, since really, he both conceived, because he said
   in his heart; and did not say in his heart, because he could not
   conceive; there is more than one way in which a thing is said in the
   heart or conceived. For, in one sense, an object is conceived, when the
   word signifying it is conceived; and in another, when the very entity,
   which the object is, is understood.

   In the former sense, then, God can be conceived not to exist; but in
   the latter, not at all. For no one who understands what fire and water
   are can conceive fire to be water, in accordance with the nature of the
   facts themselves, although this is possible according to the words. So,
   then, no one who understands what God is can conceive that God does not
   exist; although he says these words in his heart, either without any or
   with some foreign, signification. For, God is that than which a greater
   cannot be conceived. And he who thoroughly understands this, assuredly
   understands that this being so truly exists, that not even in concept
   can it be non-existent. Therefore, he who understands that God so
   exists, cannot conceive that he does not exist.

   I thank thee, gracious Lord, I thank thee; because what I formerly
   believed by thy bounty, I now so understand by thine illumination, that
   if I were unwilling to believe that thou dost exist, I should not be
   able not to understand this to be true.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

   God is whatever it is better to be than not to be; and he, as the only
   self-existent being, creates all things from nothing.

   WHAT art thou, then, Lord God, than whom nothing greater can be
   conceived? But what art thou, except that which, as the highest of all
   beings, alone exists through itself, and creates all other things from
   nothing? For, whatever is not this is less than a thing which can be
   conceived of. But this cannot be conceived of thee. What good,
   therefore, does the supreme Good lack, through which every good is?
   Therefore, thou art just, truthful, blessed, and whatever it is better
   to be than not to be. For it is better to be just than not just; better
   to be blessed than not blessed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

   How God is sensible (sensibilis) although he is not a body.--God is
   sensible, omnipotent, compassionate, passionless; for it is better to
   be these than not be. He who in any way knows, is not improperly said
   in some sort to feel.

   BUT, although it is better for thee to be sensible, omnipotent,
   compassionate, passionless, than not to be these things; how art thou
   sensible, if thou art not a body; or omnipotent, if thou hast not all
   powers; or at once compassionate and passionless? For, if only
   corporeal things are sensible, since the senses encompass a body and
   are in a body, how art thou sensible, although thou art not a body, but
   a supreme Spirit, who is superior to body? But, if feeling is only
   cognition, or for the sake of cognition,--for he who feels obtains
   knowledge in accordance with the proper functions of his senses; as
   through sight, of colors; through taste, of flavors,--whatever in any
   way cognises is not inappropriately said, in some sort, to feel.

   Therefore, O Lord, although thou art not a body yet thou art truly
   sensible in the highest degree in respect of this, that thou dost
   cognise all things in the highest degree; and not as an animal
   cognises, through a corporeal sense.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

   How he is omnipotent, although there are many things of which he is not
   capable.--To be capable of being corrupted, or of lying, is not power,
   but impotence. God can do nothing by virtue of impotence, and nothing
   has power against him.

   BUT how art thou omnipotent, if thou art not capable of all things? Or,
   if thou canst not be corrupted, and canst not lie, nor make what is
   true, false--as, for example, if thou shouldst make what has been done
   not to have been done, and the like.--how art thou capable of all
   things? Or else to be capable of these things is not power, but
   impotence. For, he who is capable of these things is capable of what is
   not for his good, and of what he ought not to do; and the more capable
   of them he is, the more power have adversity and perversity against
   him; and the less has he himself against these.

   He, then, who is thus capable is so not by power, but by impotence.
   For, he is not said to be able because he is able of himself, but
   because his impotence gives something else power over him. Or, by a
   figure of speech, just as many words are improperly applied, as when we
   use "to be" for "not to be," and "to do" for what is really not to
   do,"or to do nothing." For, often we say to a man who denies the
   existence of something: "It is as you say it to be," though it might
   seem more proper to say, "It is not, as you say it is not." In the same
   way, we say, "This man sits just as that man does," or, "This man rests
   just as that man does"; although to sit is not to do anything, and to
   rest is to do nothing.

   So, then, when one is said to have the power of doing or experiencing
   what is not for his good, or what he ought not to do, impotence is
   understood in the word power. For, the more he possesses this power,
   the more powerful are adversity and perversity against him, and the
   more powerless is he against them.

   Therefore, O Lord, our God, the more truly art thou omnipotent, since
   thou art capable of nothing through impotence, and nothing has power
   against thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

   How he is compassionate and passionless. God is compassionate, in terms
   of our experience, because we experience the effect of compassion. God
   is not compassionate, in terms of his own being, because he does not
   experience the feeling (affectus) of compassion.

   BUT how art thou compassionate, and, at the same time, passionless?
   For, if thou art passionless, thou dost not feel sympathy; and if thou
   dost not feel sympathy, thy heart is not wretched from sympathy for the
   wretched ; but this it is to be compassionate. But if thou art not
   compassionate, whence cometh so great consolation to the wretched? How,
   then, art thou compassionate and not compassionate, O Lord, unless
   because thou art compassionate in terms of our experience, and not
   compassionate in terms of thy being.

   Truly, thou art so in terms of our experience, but thou art not so in
   terms of thine own. For, when thou beholdest us in our wretchedness, we
   experience the effect of compassion, but thou dost not experience the
   feeling. Therefore, thou art both compassionate, because thou dost save
   the wretched, and spare those who sin against thee; and not
   compassionate because thou art affected by no sympathy for
   wretchedness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

   How the all-just and supremely just God spares the wicked, and justly
   pities the wicked. He is better who is good to the righteous and the
   wicked than he who is good to the righteous alone. Although God is
   supremely just, the source of his compassion is hidden. God is
   supremely compassionate, because he is supremely just. He saveth the
   just, because justice goes with them; he frees sinners by the authority
   of justice. God spares the wicked out of justice; for it is just that
   God, than whom none is better or more powerful, should be good even to
   the wicked, and should make the wicked good. If God ought not to pity,
   he pities unjustly. But this it is impious to suppose. Therefore, God
   justly pities.

   BUT how dost thou spare the wicked, if thou art all just and supremely
   just? For how, being all just and supremely just, dost thou aught that
   is not just? Or, what justice is that to give him who merits eternal
   death everlasting life? How, then, gracious Lord, good to the righteous
   and the wicked, canst thou save the wicked, if this is not just, and
   thou dost not aught that is not just? Or, since thy goodness is
   incomprehensible, is this hidden in the unapproachable light wherein
   thou dwellest? Truly, in the deepest and most secret parts of thy
   goodness is hidden the fountain whence the stream of thy compassion
   flows.

   For thou art all just and supremely just, yet thou art kind even to the
   wicked, even because thou art all supremely good. For thou wouldst be
   less good if thou wert not kind to any wicked being. For, he who is
   good, both to the righteous and the wicked, is better than he who is
   good to the wicked alone; and he who is good to the wicked, both by
   punishing and sparing them, is better than he who is good by punishing
   them alone. Therefore, thou art compassionate, because thou art all
   supremely good. And, although it appears why thou dost reward the good
   with goods and the evil with evils; yet this, at least, is most
   wonderful, why thou, the all and supremely just, who lackest nothing,
   bestowest goods on the wicked and on those who are guilty toward thee.

   The depth of thy goodness, O God! The source of thy compassion appears,
   and yet is not clearly seen! We see whence the river flows, but the
   spring whence it arises is not seen. For, it is from the abundance of
   thy goodness that thou art good to those who sin against thee; and in
   the depth of thy goodness is hidden the reason for this kindness.

   For, although thou dost reward the good with goods and the evil with
   evils, out of goodness, yet this the concept of justice seems to
   demand. But, when thou dost bestow goods on the evil, and it is known
   that the supremely Good hath willed to do this, we wonder why the
   supremely just has been able to will this.

   O compassion, from what abundant sweetness and what sweet abundance
   dost thou well forth to us! O boundless goodness of God how
   passionately should sinners love thee! For thou savest the just,
   because justice goeth with them; but sinners thou dost free by the
   authority of justice. Those by the help of their deserts; these,
   although their deserts oppose. Those by acknowledging the goods thou
   hast granted; these by pardoning the evils thou hatest. O boundless
   goodness, which dost so exceed all understanding, let that compassion
   come upon me, which proceeds from thy so great abundance! Let it flow
   upon me, for it wells forth from thee. Spare, in mercy; avenge not, in
   justice.

   For, though it is hard to understand how thy compassion is not
   inconsistent with thy justice; yet we must believe that it does not
   oppose justice at all, because it flows from goodness, which is no
   goodness without justice; nay, that it is in true harmony with justice.
   For, if thou art compassionate only because thou art supremely good,
   and supremely good only because thou art supremely just, truly thou art
   compassionate even because thou art supremely just. Help me, just and
   compassionate God, whose light seek; help me to understand what I say.

   Truly, then, thou art compassionate even because thou art just. Is,
   then, thy compassion born of thy justice? And dost thou spare the
   wicked, therefore, out of justice? If this is true, my Lord, if this is
   true, teach me how it is. Is it because it is just, that thou shouldst
   be so good that thou canst not be conceived better; and that thou
   shouldst work so powerfully that thou canst not be conceived more
   powerful? For what can be more just than this? Assuredly it could not
   be that thou shouldst be good only by requiting (retribuendo) and not
   by sparing, and that thou shouldst make good only those who are not
   good, and not the wicked also. In this way, therefore, it is just that
   thou shouldst spare the wicked, and make good souls of evil.

   Finally, what is not done justly ought not to be done; and what ought
   not to be done is done unjustly. If, then, thou dost not justly pity
   the wicked, thou oughtest not to pity them. And, if thou oughtest not
   to pity them, thou pityest them unjustly. And if it is impious to
   suppose this, it is right to believe that thou justly pityest the
   wicked.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

   How he justly punishes and justly spares the wicked.--God, in sparing
   the wicked, is just, according to his own nature because he does what
   is consistent with his goodness; but he is not just, according to our
   nature, because he does not inflict the punishment deserved.

   BUT it is also just that thou shouldst punish the wicked. For what is
   more just than that the good should receive goods, and the evil, evils?
   How, then, is it just that thou shouldst punish the wicked, and, at the
   same time, spare the wicked? Or, in one way, dost thou justly punish,
   and, in another, justly spare them? For, when thou punishest the
   wicked, it is just, because it is consistent with their deserts; and
   when, on the other hand, thou sparest the wicked, it is just, not
   because it is compatible with their deserts, but because it is
   compatible with thy goodness.

   For, in sparing the wicked, thou art as just, according to thy nature,
   but not according to ours, as thou art compassionate, according to our
   nature, and not according to thine; seeing that, as in saving us, whom
   it would be just for thee to destroy, thou art compassionate, not
   because thou feelest an affection (affectum), but because we feel the
   effect (effectum); so thou art just, not because thou requitest us as
   we deserve, but because thou dost that which becomes thee as the
   supremely good Being. In this way, therefore, without contradiction
   thou dost justly punish and justly spare.

  CHAPTER XI.

   How all the ways of God are compassion and truth; and yet God is just
   in all his ways.--We cannot comprehend why, of the wicked, he saves
   these rather than those, through his supreme goodness: and condemns
   those rather than these, through his supreme justice.

   BUT, is there any reason why it is not also just, according to thy
   nature, O Lord, that thou shouldst punish the wicked? Surely it is just
   that thou shouldst be so just that thou canst not be conceived more
   just; and this thou wouldst in no wise be if thou didst only render
   goods to the good, and not evils to the evil. For, he who requiteth
   both good and evil according to their deserts is more just than he who
   so requites the good alone. It is, therefore, just, according to thy
   nature, O just and gracious God, both when thou dost punish and when
   thou sparest.

   Truly, then, all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth (Psalms xxv.
   10); and yet the Lord is righteous in all his ways (Psalms cxlv. 17).
   And assuredly without inconsistency: For, it is not just that those
   whom thou dost will to punish should be saved, and that those whom thou
   dost will to spare should be condemned. For that alone is just which
   thou dost will; and that alone unjust which thou dost not will. So,
   then, thy compassion is born of thy justice.

   For it is just that thou shouldst be so good that thou art good in
   sparing also; and this may be the reason why the supremely Just can
   will goods for the evil. But if it can be comprehended in any way why
   thou canst will to save the wicked, yet by no consideration can we
   comprehend why, of those who are alike wicked, thou savest some rather
   than others, through supreme goodness; and why thou dost condemn the
   latter rather than the former, through supreme justice.

   So, then, thou art truly sensible (sensibilis), omnipotent,
   compassionate, and passionless, as thou art living, wise, good,
   blessed, eternal: and whatever it is better to be than not to be.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

   God is the very life whereby he lives; and so of other like attributes.

   BUT undoubtedly, whatever thou art, thou art through nothing else than
   thyself. Therefore, thou art the very life whereby thou livest; and the
   wisdom wherewith thou art wise; and the very goodness whereby thou art
   good to the righteous and the wicked; and so of other like attributes.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

   How he alone is uncircumscribed and eternal, although other spirits are
   uncircumscribed and eternal.--No place and time contain God. But he is
   himself everywhere and always. He alone not only does not cease to be,
   but also does not begin to be.

   BUT everything that is in any way bounded by place or time is less than
   that which no law of place or time limits. Since, then, nothing is
   greater than thou, no place or time contains thee; but thou art
   everywhere and always. And since this can be said of thee alone, thou
   alone art uncircumscribed and eternal.How is it, then, that other
   spirits also are said to be uncircumscribed and eternal?

   Assuredly thou art alone eternal; for thou alone among all beings not
   only dost not cease to be but also dost not begin to be.

   But how art thou alone uncircumscribed? Is it that a created spirit,
   when compared with thee is circumscribed, but when compared with
   matter, uncircumscribed? For altogether circumscribed is that which,
   when it is wholly in one place, cannot at the same time be in another.
   And this is seen to be true of corporeal things alone. But
   uncircumscribed is that which is, as a whole, at the same time
   everywhere. And this is understood to be true of thee alone. But
   circumscribed, and, at the same time, uncircumscribed is that which,
   when it is anywhere as a whole, can at the same time be somewhere else
   as a whole, and yet not everywhere. And this is recognised as true of
   created spirits. For, if the soul were not as a whole in the separate
   members of the body, it would not feel as a whole in the separate
   members.

   Therefore, thou, Lord, art peculiarly uncircumscribed and eternal; and
   yet other spirits also are uncircumscribed and eternal.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

   How and why God is seen and yet not seen by those who seek him.

   HAST thou found what thou didst seek, my soul? Thou didst seek God.
   Thou hast found him to be a being which is the highest of all beings, a
   being than which nothing better can be conceived; that this being is
   life itself, light, wisdom, goodness, eternal blessedness and blessed
   eternity; and that it is every where and always.

   For, if thou hast not found thy God, how is he this being which thou
   hast found, and which thou hast conceived him to be, with so certain
   truth and so true certainty? But, if thou hast found him, why is it
   that thou dost not feel thou hast found him? Why, O Lord, our God, does
   not my soul feel thee, if it hath found thee? Or, has it not found him
   whom it found to be light and truth? For how did it understand this,
   except by seeing light and truth? Or, could it understand anything at
   all of thee, except through thy light and thy truth?

   Hence, if it has seen light and truth, it has seen thee; if it has not
   seen thee, it has not seen light and truth. Or, is what it has seen
   both light and truth; and still it has not yet seen thee, because it
   has seen thee only in part, but has not seen thee as thou art? Lord my
   God, my creator and renewer, speak to the desire of my soul, what thou
   art other than it hath seen, that it may clearly see what it desires.
   It strains to see thee more; and sees nothing beyond this which it hath
   seen, except darkness. Nay, it does not see darkness, of which-there is
   none in thee; but it sees that it cannot see farther, because of its
   own darkness.

   Why is this, Lord, why is this? Is the eye of the soul darkened by its
   infirmity, or dazzled by thy glory? Surely it is both darkened in
   itself, and dazzled by thee. Doubtless it is both obscured by its own
   insignificance, and overwhelmed by thy infinity. Truly, it is both
   contracted by its own narrowness and overcome by thy greatness.

   For how great is that light from which shines every truth that gives
   light to the rational mind? How great is that truth in which is
   everything that is true, and outside which is only nothingness and the
   false? How boundless is the truth which sees at one glance whatsoever
   has been made, and by whom, and through whom, and how it has been made
   from nothing? What purity, what certainty, what splendor where it is?
   Assuredly more than a creature can conceive.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

   He is greater than can be conceived.

   THEREFORE, O Lord, thou art not only that than which a greater cannot
   be conceived, but thou art a being greater than can be conceived. For,
   since it can be conceived that there is such a being, if thou art not
   this very being, a greater than thou can be conceived. But this is
   impossible.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

   This is the unapproachable light wherein he dwells.

   TRULY, O Lord, this is the unapproachable light in which thou dwellest;
   for truly there is nothing else which can penetrate this light, that it
   may see thee there. Truly, I see it not, because it is too bright for
   me. And yet, whatsoever I see, I see through it, as the weak eye sees
   what it sees through the light of the sun, which in the sun itself it
   cannot look upon. My understanding cannot reach that light, for it
   shines too bright. It does not comprehend it, nor does the eye of my
   soul endure to gaze upon it long. It is dazzled by the brightness, it
   is overcome by the greatness, it is overwhelmed by the infinity, it is
   dazed by the largeness, of the light.

   O supreme and unapproachable light! O whole and blessed truth, how far
   art thou from me, who am so near to thee! How far removed art thou from
   my vision, though I am so near to thine! Everywhere thou art wholly
   present, and I see thee not. In thee I move, and in thee I have my
   being; and I cannot come to thee. Thou art within me, and about me, and
   I feel thee not.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

   In God is harmony, fragrance, sweetness, pleasantness to the touch,
   beauty, after his ineffable manner.

   STILL thou art hidden, O Lord, from my soul in thy light and thy
   blessedness; and therefore my soul still walks in its darkness and
   wretchedness. For it looks, and does not see thy beauty. It hearkens,
   and does not hear thy harmony. It smells, and does not perceive thy
   fragrance. It tastes, and does not recognize thy sweetness. It touches,
   and does not feel thy pleasantness. For thou hast these attributes in
   thyself, Lord God, after thine ineffable manner, who hast given them to
   objects created by thee, after their sensible manner; but the sinful
   senses of my soul have grown rigid and dull, and have been obstructed
   by their long listlessness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

   God is life, wisdom, eternity, and every true good.--Whatever is
   composed of parts is not wholly one; it is capable, either in fact or
   in concept, of dissolution. In God wisdom, eternity, etc., are not
   parts, but one, and the very whole which God is, or unity itself, not
   even in concept divisible.

   AND lo, again confusion; lo, again grief and mourning meet him who
   seeks for joy and gladness. My soul now hoped for satisfaction; and lo,
   again it is overwhelmed with need. I desired now to feast, and lo, I
   hunger more. I tried to rise to the light of God, and I have fallen
   back into my darkness. Nay, not only have I fallen into it, but I feel
   that I am enveloped in it. I fell before my mother conceived me. Truly,
   in darkness I was conceived, and in the cover of darkness I was born.
   Truly, in him we all fell, in whom we all sinned. In him we all lost,
   who kept easily, and wickedly lost to himself and to us that which when
   we wish to seek it, we do not know; when we seek it, we do not find;
   when we find, it is not that which we seek.

   Do thou help me for thy goodness' sake! Lord, I sought thy face; thy
   face, Lord, will I seek; hide not thy face far from me (Psalms xxvii.
   8). Free me from myself toward thee. Cleanse, heal, sharpen, enlighten
   the eye of my mind, that it may behold thee. Let my soul recover its
   strength, and with all its understanding let it strive toward thee, O
   Lord. What art thou, Lord, what art thou? What shall my heart conceive
   thee to be?

   Assuredly thou art life, thou art wisdom, thou art truth, thou art
   goodness, thou art blessedness, thou art eternity, and thou art every
   true good. Many are these attributes: my straitened understanding
   cannot see so many at one view, that it may be gladdened by all at
   once. How, then, O Lord, art thou all these things? Are they parts of
   thee, or is each one of these rather the whole, which thou art? For,
   whatever is composed of parts is not altogether one, but is in some
   sort plural, and diverse from itself; and either in fact or in concept
   is capable of dissolution.

   But these things are alien to thee, than whom nothing better can be
   conceived of. Hence, there are no parts in thee, Lord, nor art thou
   more than one. But thou art so truly a unitary being, and so identical
   with thyself, that in no respect art thou unlike thyself; rather thou
   art unity itself, indivisible by any conception. Therefore, life and
   wisdom and the rest are not parts of thee, but all are one; and each of
   these is the whole, which thou art, and which all the rest are.

   In this way, then, it appears that thou hast no parts, and that thy
   eternity, which thou art, is nowhere and never a part of thee or of thy
   eternity. But everywhere thou art as a whole, and thy eternity exists
   as a whole forever.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

   He does not exist in place or time, but all things exist in him.

   BUT if through thine eternity thou hast been, and art, and wilt be; and
   to have been is not to be destined to be; and to be is not to have
   been, or to be destined to be; how does thine eternity exist as a whole
   forever? Or is it true that nothing of thy eternity passes away, so
   that it is not now; and that nothing of it is destined to be, as if it
   were not yet?

   Thou wast not, then, yesterday, nor wilt thou be to-morrow; but
   yesterday and to-day and to-morrow thou art; or, rather, neither
   yesterday nor to-day nor to-morrow thou art; but simply, thou art,
   outside all time. For yesterday and to-day and to-morrow have no
   existence, except in time; but thou, although nothing exists without
   thee, nevertheless dost not exist in space or time, but all things
   exist in thee. For nothing contains thee, but thou containest all.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XX.

   He exists before all things and transcends all things, even the eternal
   things.--The eternity of God is present as a whole with him; while
   other things have not yet that part of their eternity which is still to
   be, and have no longer that part which is past.

   HENCE, thou dost permeate and embrace all things. Thou art before all,
   and dost transcend all. And, of a surety, thou art before all; for
   before they were made, thou art. But how dost thou transcend all? In
   what way dost thou transcend those beings which will have no end? Is it
   because they cannot exist at all without thee; while thou art in no
   wise less, if they should return to nothingness? For so, in a certain
   sense, thou dost transcend them. Or, is it also because they can be
   conceived to have an end; but thou by no means? For so they actually
   have an end, in a certain sense; but thou, in no sense. And certainly,
   what in no sense has an end transcends what is ended in any sense. Or,
   in this way also dost thou transcend all things, even the eternal,
   because thy eternity and theirs is present as a whole with thee; while
   they have not yet that part of their eternity which is to come, just as
   they no longer have that part which is past? For so thou dost ever
   transcend them, since thou art ever present with thyself, and since
   that to which they have not yet come is ever present with thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

   Is this the age of the age, or ages of ages?--The eternity of God
   contains the ages of time themselves, and can be called the age of the
   age or ages of ages.

   Is this, then, the age of the age, or ages of ages? For, as an age of
   time contains all temporal things, so thy eternity contains even the
   ages of time themselves. And these are indeed an age, because of their
   indivisible unity; but ages, because of their endless immeasurability.
   And, although thou art so great, O Lord, that all things are full of
   thee, and exist in thee; yet thou art so without all space, that
   neither midst, nor half, nor any part, is in thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

   He alone is what he is and who he is.--All things need God for their
   being and their well-being.

   THEREFORE, thou alone, O Lord, art what thou art; and thou art he who
   thou art. For, what is one thing in the whole and another in the parts,
   and in which there is any mutable element, is not altogether what it
   is. And what begins from non-existence, and can be conceived not to
   exist, and unless it subsists through something else, returns to
   non-existence; and what has a past existence, which is no longer, or a
   future existence, which is not yet,--this does not properly and
   absolutely exist.

   But thou art what thou art, because, whatever thou art at any time, or
   in any way, thou art as a whole and forever. And thou art he who thou
   art, properly and simply; for thou hast neither a past existence nor a
   future, but only a present existence; nor canst thou be conceived as at
   any time non-existent. But thou art life, and light, and wisdom, and
   blessedness, and many goods of this nature. And yet thou art only one
   supreme good; thou art all-sufficient to thyself, and needest none; and
   thou art he whom all things need for their existence and wellbeing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

   This good is equally Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit. And this is a
   single, necessary Being, which is every good, and wholly good, and the
   only good.--Since the Word is true, and is truth itself, there is
   nothing in the Father, who utters it, which is not accomplished in the
   Word by which he expresses himself. Neither is the love which proceeds
   from Father and Son unequal to the Father or the Son, for Father and
   Son love themselves and one another in the same degree in which what
   they are is good. Of supreme simplicity nothing can be born, and from
   it nothing can proceed, except that which is this, of which it is born,
   or from which it proceeds.

   THIS good thou art, thou, God the Father; this is thy Word, that is,
   thy Son. For nothing, other than what thou art, or greater or less than
   thou, can be in the Word by which thou dost express thyself; for thy
   Word is true, as thou art truthful. And, hence, it is truth itself,
   just as thou art; no other truth than thou; and thou art of so simple a
   nature, that of thee nothing can be born other than what thou art. This
   very good is the one love common to thee and to thy Son, that is, the
   Holy Spirit proceeding from both. For this love is not unequal to thee
   or to thy Son; seeing that thou dost love thyself and him, and he, thee
   and himself, to the whole extent of thy being and his. Nor is there
   aught else proceeding from thee and from him, which is not unequal to
   thee and to him. Nor can anything proceed from the supreme simplicity,
   other than what this, from which it proceeds, is.

   But what each is, separately, this is all the Trinity at once, Father,
   Son, and Holy Spirit; seeing that each separately is none other than
   the supremely simple unity, and the supremely unitary simplicity which
   can neither be multiplied nor varied. Moreover, there is a single
   necessary Being. Now, this is that single, necessary Being, in which is
   every good; nay, which is every good, and a single entire good, and the
   only good.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIV.

   Conjecture as to the character and the magnitude of this good.--If the
   created life is good, how good is the creative life!

   AND now, my soul, arouse and lift up all thy understanding, and
   conceive, so far as thou canst, of what character and how great is that
   good! For, if individual goods are delectable, conceive in earnestness
   how delectable is that good which contains the pleasantness of all
   goods; and not such as we have experienced in created objects, but as
   different as the Creator from the creature. For, if the created life is
   good, how good is the creative life! If the salvation given is
   delightful, how delightful is the salvation which has given all
   salvation! If wisdom in the knowledge of the created world is lovely,
   how lovely is the wisdom which has created all things from nothing!
   Finally, if there are many great delights in delectable things, what
   and how great is the delight in him who has made these delectable
   things.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

   What goods and how great, belong to those who enjoy this good.--Joy is
   multiplied in the blessed from the blessedness and joy of others.

   WHO shall enjoy this good? And what shall belong to him, and what shall
   not belong to him? At any rate, whatever he shall wish shall be his,
   and whatever he shall not wish shall not be his. For, these goods of
   body and soul will be such as eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
   has the heart of man conceived (Isaiah lxiv. 4; I Corinthians ii. 9).

   Why, then, dost thou wander abroad, slight man, in thy search for the
   goods of thy soul and thy body? Love the one good in which are all
   goods, and it sufficeth. Desire the simple good which is every good,
   and it is enough. For, what dost thou love, my flesh? What dost thou
   desire, my soul? There, there is whatever ye love, whatever ye desire.

   If beauty delights thee, there shall the righteous shine forth as the
   sun (Matthew xiii. 43). If swiftness or endurance, or freedom of body,
   which naught can withstand, delight thee, they shall be as angels of
   God,--because it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body
   (I Corinthians xv. 44)--in power certainly, though not in nature. If it
   is a long and sound life that pleases thee, there a healthful eternity
   is, and an eternal health. For the righteous shall live for ever
   (Wisdom v. 15), and the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord
   (Psalms xxxvii. 39). If it is satisfaction of hunger, they shall be
   satisfied when the glory of the Lord hath appeared (Psalms xvii. 15).
   If it is quenching of thirst, they shall be abundantly satisfied with
   the fatness of thy house (Psalms xxxvi. 8). If it is melody, there the
   choirs of angels sing forever, before God. If it is any not impure, but
   pure, pleasure, thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy
   pleasures, O God (Psalms xxxvi. 8).

   If it is wisdom that delights thee, the very wisdom of God will reveal
   itself to them. If friendship, they shall love God more than
   themselves, and one another as themselves. And God shall love them more
   than they themselves; for they love him, and themselves, and one
   another, through him, and he, himself and them, through himself. If
   concord, they shall all have a single will.

   If power, they shall have all power to fulfil their will, as God to
   fulfil his. For, as God will have power to do what he wills, through
   himself, so they will have power, through him, to do what they will.
   For, as they will not will aught else than he, he shall will whatever
   they will; and what he shall will cannot fail to be. If honor and
   riches, God shall make his good and faithful servants rulers over many
   things (Luke xii. 42); nay, they shall be called sons of God, and gods;
   and where his Son shall be, there they shall be also, heirs indeed of
   God, and joint-heirs with Christ (Romans viii. 17).

   If true security delights thee, undoubtedly they shall be as sure that
   those goods, or rather that good, will never and in no wise fail them;
   as they shall be sure that they will not lose it of their own accord;
   and that God, who loves them, will not take it away from those who love
   him against their will; and that nothing more powerful than God will
   separate him from them against his will and theirs.

   But what, or how great, is the joy, where such and so great is the
   good! Heart of man, needy heart, heart acquainted with sorrows, nay,
   overwhelmed with sorrows, how greatly wouldst thou rejoice, if thou
   didst abound in all these things! Ask thy inmost mind whether it could
   contain its joy over so great a blessedness of its own.

   Yet assuredly, if any other whom thou didst love altogether as thyself
   possessed the same blessedness, thy joy would be doubled, because thou
   wouldst rejoice not less for him than for thyself. But, if two, or
   three, or many more, had the same joy, thou wouldst rejoice as much for
   each one as for thyself, if thou didst love each as thyself. Hence, in
   that perfect love of innumerable blessed angels and sainted men, where
   none shall love another less than himself, every one shall rejoice for
   each of the others as for himself.

   If, then, the heart of man will scarce contain his joy over his own so
   great good, how shall it contain so many and so great joys? And
   doubtless, seeing that every one loves another so far as he rejoices in
   the other's good, and as, in that perfect felicity, each one should
   love God beyond compare, more than himself and all the others with him;
   so he will rejoice beyond reckoning in the felicity of God, more than
   in his own and that of all the others with him.

   But if they shall so love God with all their heart, and all their mind,
   and all their soul, that still all the heart, and all the mind, and all
   the soul shall not suffice for the worthiness of this love; doubtless
   they will so rejoice with all their heart, and all their mind, and all
   their soul, that all the heart, and all the mind, and all the soul
   shall not suffice for the fulness of their joy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVI.

   Is this joy which the Lord promises made full?--The blessed shall
   rejoice according as they shall love; and they shall love according as
   they shall know.

   My God and my Lord, my hope and the joy of my heart, speak unto my soul
   and tell me whether this is the joy of which thou tellest us through
   thy Son: Ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full (John xvi.
   24). For I have found a joy that is full, and more than full. For when
   heart, and mind, and soul, and all the man, are full of that joy, joy
   beyond measure will still remain. Hence, not all of that joy shall
   enter into those who rejoice; but they who rejoice shall wholly enter
   into that joy.

   Show me, O Lord, show thy servant in his heart whether this is the joy
   into which thy servants shall enter, who shall enter into the joy of
   their Lord. But that joy, surely, with which thy chosen ones shall
   rejoice, eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither has it entered into
   the heart of man (Isaiah lxiv. 4; I Corinthians ii. 9). Not yet, then,
   have I told or conceived, O Lord, how greatly those blessed ones of
   thine shall rejoice. Doubtless they shall rejoice according as they
   shall love; and they shall love according as they shall know. How far
   they will know thee, Lord, then! and how much they will love thee!
   Truly, eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into
   the heart of man in this life, how far they shall know thee, and how
   much they shall love thee in that life.

   I pray, O God, to know thee, to love thee, that I may rejoice in thee.
   And if I cannot attain to full joy in this life may I at least advance
   from day to day, until that joy shall come to the full. Let the
   knowledge of thee advance in me here, and there be made full. Let the
   love of thee increase, and there let it be full, that here my joy may
   be great in hope, and there full in truth. Lord, through thy Son thou
   dost command, nay, thou dost counsel us to ask; and thou dost promise
   that we shall receive, that our joy may be full. I ask, O Lord, as thou
   dost counsel through our wonderful Counsellor. I will receive what thou
   dost promise by virtue of thy truth, that my joy may be full. Faithful
   God, I ask. I will receive, that my joy may be full. Meanwhile, let my
   mind meditate upon it; let my tongue speak of it. Let my heart love it;
   let my mouth talk of it. Let my soul hunger for it; let my flesh thirst
   for it; let my whole being desire it, until I enter into thy joy, O
   Lord, who art the Three and the One God, blessed for ever and ever.
   Amen.

                              ANSELM'S MONOLOGIUM

ON THE BEING OF GOD.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PREFACE.

   In this book Anselm discusses, under the form of a meditation, the
   Being of God, basing his argument not on the authority of Scripture,
   but on the force of reason. It contains nothing that is inconsistent
   with the writings of the Holy Fathers, and especially nothing that is
   inconsistent with those of St. Augustine. --The Greek terminology is
   employed in Chapter LXXVIII., where it is stated that the Trinity may
   be said to consist of three substances, that is, three persons.

   CERTAIN brethren have often and earnestly entreated me to put in
   writing some thoughts that I had offered them in familiar conversation,
   regarding meditation on the Being of God, and on some other topics
   connected with this subject, under the form of a meditation on these
   themes. It is in accordance with their wish, rather than with my
   ability, that they have prescribed such a form for the writing of this
   meditation; in order that nothing in Scripture should be urged on the
   authority of Scripture itself, but that whatever the conclusion of
   independent investigation should declare to be true, should, in an
   unadorned style, with common proofs and with a simple argument, be
   briefly enforced by the cogency of reason, and plainly expounded in the
   light of truth. It was their wish also, that I should not disdain to
   meet such simple and almost foolish objections as occur to me.

   This task I have long refused to undertake. And, reflecting on the
   matter, I have tried on many grounds to excuse myself; for the more
   they wanted this work to be adaptable to practical use, the more was
   what they enjoined on me difficult of execution. Overcome at last,
   however, both by the modest importunity of their entreaties and by the
   not contemptible sincerity of their zeal; and reluctant as I was
   because of the difficulty of my task and the weakness of my talent, I
   entered upon the work they asked for. But it is with pleasure inspired
   by their affection that, so far as I was able, I have prosecuted this
   work within the limits they set.

   I was led to this undertaking in the hope that whatever I might
   accomplish would soon be overwhelmed with contempt, as by men disgusted
   with some worthless thing. For I know that in this book I have not so
   much satisfied those who entreated me, as put an end to the entreaties
   that followed me so urgently. Yet, somehow it fell out, contrary to my
   hope, that not only the brethren mentioned above, but several others,
   by making copies for their own use, condemned this writing to long
   remembrance. And, after frequent consideration, I have not been able to
   find that I have made in it any statement which is inconsistent with
   the writings of the Catholic Fathers, or especially with those of St.
   Augustine. Wherefore, if it shall appear to any man that I have offered
   in this work any thought that is either too novel or discordant with
   the truth, I ask him not to denounce me at once as one who boldly
   seizes upon new ideas, or as a maintainer of falsehood; but let him
   first read diligently Augustine's books on the Trinity, and then judge
   my treatise in the light of those.

   In stating that the supreme Trinity may be said to consist of three
   substances, I have followed the Greeks, who acknowledge three
   substances in one Essence, in the same faith wherein we acknowledge
   three persons in one Substance. For they designate by the word
   substance that attribute of God which we designate by the word person.

   Whatever I have said on that point, however, is put in the mouth of one
   debating and investigating in solitary reflection, questions to which
   he had given no attention before. And this method I knew to be in
   accordance with the wish of those whose request I was striving to
   fulfil. But it is my prayer and earnest entreaty, that if any shall
   wish to copy this work, he shall be careful to place this preface at
   the beginning of the book, before the body of the meditation itself.
   For I believe that one will be much helped in understanding the matter
   of this book, if he has taken note of the intention, and the method
   according to which it is discussed. It is my opinion, too, that one who
   has first seen this preface will not pronounce a rash judgment, if he
   shall find offered here any thought that is contrary to his own belief.

  CHAPTER I.

   There is a being which is best, and greatest, and highest of all
   existing beings.

   IF any man, either from ignorance or unbelief, has no knowledge of the
   existence of one Nature which is the highest of all existing beings,
   which is also sufficient to itself in its eternal blessedness, and
   which confers upon and effects in all other beings, through its
   omnipotent goodness, the very fact of their existence, and the fact
   that in any way their existence is good; and if he has no knowledge of
   many other things, which we necessarily believe regarding God and his
   creatures, he still believes that he can at least convince himself of
   these truths in great part, even if his mental powers are very
   ordinary, by the force of reason alone.

   And, although he could do this in many ways, I shall adopt one which I
   consider easiest for such a man. For, since all desire to enjoy only
   those things which they suppose to be good, it is natural that this man
   should, at some time, turn his mind's eye to the examination of that
   cause by which these things are good, which he does not desire, except
   as he judges them to be good. So that, as reason leads the way and
   follows up these considerations, he advances rationally to those truths
   of which, without reason, he has no knowledge. And if, in this
   discussion, I use any argument which no greater authority adduces, I
   wish it to be received in this way: although, on the grounds that I
   shall see fit to adopt, the conclusion is reached as if necessarily,
   yet it is not, for this reason, said to be absolutely necessary, but
   merely that it can appear so for the time being.

   It is easy, then, for one to say to himself: Since there are goods so
   innumerable, whose great diversity we experience by the bodily senses,
   and discern by our mental faculties, must we not believe that there is
   some one thing, through which all goods whatever are good? Or are they
   good one through one thing and another through another? To be sure, it
   is most certain and clear, for all who are willing to see, that
   whatsoever things are said to possess any attribute in such a way that
   in mutual comparison they may be said to possess it in greater, or
   less, or equal degree, are said to possess it by virtue of some fact,
   which is not understood to be one thing in one case and another in
   another, but to be the same in different cases, whether it is regarded
   as existing in these cases in equal or unequal degree. For, whatsoever
   things are said to be just, when compared one with another, whether
   equally, or more, or less, cannot be understood as just, except through
   the quality of justness, which is not one thing in one instance, and
   another in another.

   Since it is certain, then, that all goods, if mutually compared, would
   prove either equally or unequally good, necessarily they are all good
   by virtue of something which is conceived of as the same in different
   goods, although sometimes they seem to be called good, the one by
   virtue of one thing, the other by virtue of another. For, apparently it
   is by virtue of one quality, that a horse is called good, because he is
   strong, and by virtue of another, that he is called good, because he is
   swift. For, though he seems to be called good by virtue of his
   strength, and good by virtue of his swiftness, yet swiftness and
   strength do not appear to be the same thing.

   But if a horse, because he is strong and swift, is therefore good, how
   is it that a strong, swift robber is bad? Rather, then, just as a
   strong, swift robber is bad, because he is harmful, so a strong, swift
   horse is good, because he is useful. And, indeed, nothing is ordinarily
   regarded as good, except either for some utility--as, for instance,
   safety is called good, and those things which promote safety--or for
   some honorable character--as, for instance, beauty is reckoned to be
   good, and what promotes beauty.

   But, since the reasoning which we have observed is in no wise
   refutable, necessarily, again, all things, whether useful or honorable,
   if they are truly good, are good through that same being through which
   all goods exist, whatever that being is. But who can doubt this very
   being, through which all goods exist, to be a great good? This must be,
   then, a good through itself, since every other good is through it.

   It follows, therefore, that all other goods are good through another
   being than that which they themselves are, and this being alone is good
   through itself. Hence, this alone is supremely good, which is alone
   good through itself. For it is supreme, in that it so surpasses other
   beings, that it is neither equalled nor excelled. But that which is
   supremely good is also supremely great. There is, therefore, some one
   being which is supremely good, and supremely great, that is, the
   highest of all existing beings.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

   The same subject continued.

   BUT, just as it has been proved that there is a being that is supremely
   good, since all goods are good through a single being, which is good
   through itself; so it is necessarily inferred that there is something
   supremely great, which is great through itself. But, I do not mean
   physically great, as a material object is great, but that which, the
   greater it is, is the better or the more worthy,--wisdom, for instance.
   And since there can be nothing supremely great except what is supremely
   good, there must be a being that is greatest and best, i. e., the
   highest of all existing beings.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

   There is a certain Nature through which whatever is exists, and which
   exists through itself, and is the highest of all existing beings.

   THEREFORE, not only are all good things such through something that is
   one and the same, and all great things such through something that is
   one and the same; but whatever is, apparently exists through something
   that is one and the same. For, everything that is, exists either
   through something, or through nothing. But nothing exists through
   nothing. For it is altogether inconceivable that anything should not
   exist by virtue of something.

   Whatever is, then, does not exist except through something. Since this
   is true, either there is one being, or there are more than one, through
   which all things that are exist. But if there are more than one, either
   these are themselves to be referred to some one being, through which
   they exist, or they exist separately, each through itself, or they
   exist mutually through one another.

   But, if these beings exist through one being, then all things do not
   exist through more than one, but rather through that one being through
   which these exist.

   If, however, these exist separately, each through itself, there is, at
   any rate, some power or property of existing through self (existendi
   per se), by which they are able to exist each through itself. But,
   there can be no doubt that, in that case, they exist through this very
   power, which is one, and through which they are able to exist, each
   through itself. More truly, then, do all things exist through this very
   being, which is one, than through these, which are more than one,
   which, without this one, cannot exist.

   But that these beings exist mutually through one another, no reason can
   admit; since it is an irrational conception that anything should exist
   through a being on which it confers existence. For not even beings of a
   relative nature exist thus mutually, the one through the other. For,
   though the terms master and servant are used with mutual reference, and
   the men thus designated are mentioned as having mutual relations, yet
   they do not at all exist mutually, the one through the other, since
   these relations exist through the subjects to which they are referred.

   Therefore, since truth altogether excludes the supposition that there
   are more beings than one, through which all things exist, that being,
   through which all exist, must be one. Since, then, all things that are
   exist through this one being, doubtless this one being exists through
   itself. Whatever things there are else then, exist through something
   other than themselves, and this alone through itself. But whatever
   exists through another is less than that, through which all things are,
   and which alone exists through itself. Therefore, that which exists
   through itself exists in the greatest degree of all things.

   There is, then, some one being which alone exists in the greatest and
   the highest degree of all. But that which is greatest of all, and
   through which exists whatever is good or great, and, in short, whatever
   has any existence--that must be supremely good, and supremely great,
   and the highest of all existing beings.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

   The same subject continued.

   FURTHERMORE, if one observes the nature of things he perceives, whether
   he will or no, that not all are embraced in a single degree of dignity;
   but that certain among them are distinguished by inequality of degree.
   For, he who doubts that the horse is superior in its nature to wood,
   and man more excellent than the horse, assuredly does not deserve the
   name of man. Therefore, although it cannot be denied that some natures
   are superior to others, nevertheless reason convinces us that some
   nature is so preeminent among these, that it has no superior. For, if
   the distinction of degrees is infinite, so that there is among them no
   degree, than which no higher can be found, our course of reasoning
   reaches this conclusion: that the multitude of natures themselves is
   not limited by any bounds. But only an absurdly foolish man can fail to
   regard such a conclusion as absurdly foolish. There is, then,
   necessarily some nature which is so superior to some nature or natures,
   that there is none in comparison with which it is ranked as inferior.

   Now, this nature which is such, either is single, or there are more
   natures than one of this sort, and they are of equal degree.

   But, if they are more than one and equal, since they cannot be equal
   through any diverse causes, but only through some cause which is one
   and the same, that one cause, through which they are equally so great,
   either is itself what they are, that is, the very essence of these
   natures; or else it is another than what they are.

   But if it is nothing else than their very essence itself, just as they
   have not more than one essence, but a single essence, so they have not
   more than one nature, but a single nature. For I here understand nature
   as identical with essence.

   If, however, that through which these natures are so great is another
   than that which they are, then, certainly, they are less than that
   through which they are so great. For, whatever is great through
   something else is less than that through which it is great. Therefore,
   they are not so great that there is nothing else greater than they.

   But if, neither through what they are nor through anything other than
   themselves, can there be more such natures than one, than which nothing
   else shall be more excellent, then in no wise can there be more than
   one nature of this kind. We conclude, then, that there is some nature
   which is one and single, and which is so superior to others that it is
   inferior to none. But that which is such is the greatest and best of
   all existing beings. Hence, there is a certain nature which is the
   highest of all existing beings. This, however, it cannot be, unless it
   is what it is through itself, and all existing beings are what they are
   through it.

   For since, as our reasoning showed us not long since, that which exists
   through itself, and through which all other things exist, is the
   highest of all existing beings; either conversely, that which is the
   highest exists through itself, and all others through it; or, there
   will be more than one supreme being. But it is manifest that there
   cannot be more than one supreme being. There is, therefore, a certain
   Nature, or Substance, or Essence, which is through itself good and
   great, and through itself is what it is; and through which exists
   whatever is truly good, or great, or has any existence at all; and
   which is the supreme good being, the supreme great being, being or
   subsisting as supreme, that is, the highest of all existing beings.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

   Just as this Nature exists through itself, and other beings through it,
   so it derives existence from itself, and other beings from it.

   SEEING, then, that the truth already discovered has been satisfactorily
   demonstrated, it is profitable to examine whether this Nature, and all
   things that have any existence, derive existence from no other source
   than it, just as they do not exist except through it.

   But it is clear that one may say, that what derives existence from
   something exists through the same thing; and what exists through
   something also derives existence from it. For instance, what derives
   existence from matter, and exists through the artificer, may also be
   said to exist through matter, and to derive existence from the
   artificer, since it exists through both, and derives existence from
   both. That is, it is endowed with existence by both, although it exists
   through matter and from the artificer in another sense than that in
   which it exists through, and from, the artificer.

   It follows, then, that just as all existing beings are what they are,
   through the supreme Nature, and as that Nature exists through itself,
   but other beings through another than themselves, so all existing
   beings derive existence from this supreme Nature. And therefore, this
   Nature derives existence from itself, but other beings from it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

   This Nature was not brought into existence with the help of any
   external cause, yet it does not exist through nothing, or derive
   existence from nothing.--How existence through self, and derived from
   self, is conceivable.

   SINCE the same meaning is not always attached to the phrase, "existence
   through" something, or, to the phrase, "existence derived from"
   something, very diligent inquiry must be made, in what way all existing
   beings exist through the supreme Nature, or derive existence from it.
   For, what exists through itself, and what exists through another, do
   not admit the same ground of existence. Let us first consider,
   separately, this supreme Nature, which exists through self; then these
   beings which exist through another.

   Since it is evident, then, that this Nature is whatever it is, through
   itself, and all other beings are what they are, through it, how does it
   exist through itself? For, what is said to exist through anything
   apparently exists through an efficient agent, or through matter, or
   through some other external aid, as through some instrument. But,
   whatever exists in any of these three ways exists through another than
   itself, and is of later existence, and, in some sort, less than that
   through which it obtains existence.

   But, in no wise does the supreme Nature exist through another, nor is
   it later or less than itself or anything else. Therefore, the supreme
   Nature could be created neither by itself, nor by another; nor could
   itself or any other be the matter whence it should be created; nor did
   it assist itself in any way; nor did anything assist it to be what it
   was not before.

   What is to be inferred? For that which cannot have come into existence
   by any creative agent, or from any matter, or with any external aids,
   seems either to be nothing, or, if it has any existence, to exist
   through nothing, and derive existence from nothing. And although, in
   accordance with the observations I have already made, in the light of
   reason, regarding the supreme Substance, I should think such
   propositions could in no wise be true in the case of supreme Substance;
   yet, I would not neglect to give a connected demonstration of this
   matter.

   For, seeing that this my meditation has suddenly brought me to an
   important and interesting point, I am unwilling to pass over carelessly
   even any simple or almost foolish objection that occurs to me, in my
   argument; in order that by leaving no ambiguity in my discussion up to
   this point, I may have the better assured strength to advance toward
   what follows; and in order that if, perchance, I shall wish to convince
   any one of the truth of my speculations, even one of the slower minds,
   through the removal of every obstacle, however slight, may acquiesce in
   what it finds here.

   That this Nature, then, without which no nature exists, is nothing, is
   as false as it would be absurd to say that whatever is is nothing. And,
   moreover, it does not exist through nothing, because it is utterly
   inconceivable that what is something should exist through nothing. But,
   if in any way it derives existence from nothing, it does so through
   itself, or through another, or through nothing. But it is evident that
   in no wise does anything exist through nothing. If, then, in any way it
   derives existence from nothing, it does so either through itself or
   through another.

   But nothing can, through itself, derive existence from nothing, because
   if anything derives existence from nothing, through something, then
   that through which it exists must exist before it. Seeing that this
   Being, then, does not exist before itself, by no means does it derive
   existence from itself.

   But if it is supposed to have derived existence from some other nature,
   then it is not the supreme Nature, but some inferior one, nor is it
   what it is through itself, but through another.

   Again: if this Nature derives existence from nothing, through
   something, that through which it exists was a great good, since it was
   the cause of good. But no good can be understood as existing before
   that good, without which nothing is good; and it is sufficiently clear
   that this good, without which there is no good, is the supreme Nature
   which is under discussion. Therefore, it is not even conceivable that
   this Nature was preceded by any being, through which it derived
   existence from nothing.

   Hence, if it has any existence through nothing, or derives existence
   from nothing, there is no doubt that either, whatever it is, it does
   not exist through itself, or derive existence from itself, or else it
   is itself nothing. It is unnecessary to show that both these
   suppositions are false. The supreme Substance, then, does not exist
   through any efficient agent, and does not derive existence from any
   matter, and was not aided in being brought into existence by any
   external causes. Nevertheless, it by no means exists through nothing,
   or derives existence from nothing; since, through itself and from
   itself, it is whatever it is.

   Finally, as to how it should be understood to exist through itself, and
   to derive existence from itself: it did not create itself, nor did it
   spring up as its own matter, nor did it in any way assist itself to
   become what it was not before, unless, haply, it seems best to conceive
   of this subject in the way in which one says that the light lights or
   is lucent, through and from itself. For, as are the mutual relations of
   the light and to light and lucent (lux, lucere, lucens), such are the
   relations of essence, and to be and being, that is, existing or
   subsisting. So the supreme Being, and to be in the highest degree, and
   being in the highest degree, bear much the same relations, one to
   another, as the light and to light and lucent.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

   In what way all other beings exist through this Nature and derive
   existence from it.

   THERE now remains the discussion of that whole class of beings that
   exist through another, as to how they exist through the supreme
   Substance, whether because this Substance created them all, or because
   it was the material of all. For, there is no need to inquire whether
   all exist through it, for this reason, namely, that there being another
   creative agent, or another existing material, this supreme Substance
   has merely aided in bringing about the existence of all things: since
   it is inconsistent with what has already been shown, that whatever
   things are should exist secondarily, and not primarily, through it.

   First, then, it seems to me, we ought to inquire whether that whole
   class of beings which exist through another derive existence from any
   material. But I do not doubt that all this solid world, with its parts,
   just as we see, consists of earth, water, fire, and air. These four
   elements, of course, can be conceived of without these forms which we
   see in actual objects, so that their formless, or even confused, nature
   appears to be the material of all bodies, distinguished by their own
   forms.--I say that I do not doubt this. But I ask, whence this very
   material that I have mentioned, the material of the mundane mass,
   derives its existence. For, if there is some material of this material,
   then that is more truly the material of the physical universe.

   If, then, the universe of things, whether visible or invisible, derives
   existence from any material, certainly it not only cannot be, but it
   cannot even be supposed to be, from any other material than from the
   supreme Nature or from itself, or from some third being--but this last,
   at any rate, does not exist. For, indeed, nothing is even conceivable
   except that highest of all beings, which exists through itself, and the
   universe of beings which exist, not through themselves, but through
   this supreme Being. Hence, that which has no existence at all is not
   the material of anything.

   From its own nature the universe cannot derive existence, since, if
   this were the case, it would in some sort exist through itself and so
   through another than that through which all things exist. But all these
   suppositions are false.

   Again, everything that derives existence from material derives
   existence from another, and exists later than that other. Therefore,
   since nothing is other than itself, or later than itself, it follows
   that nothing derives material existence from itself.

   But if, from the material of the supreme Nature itself, any lesser
   being can derive existence, the supreme good is subject to change and
   corruption. But this it is impious to suppose. Hence, since everything
   that is other than this supreme Nature is less than it, it is
   impossible that anything other than it in this way derives existence
   from it.

   Furthermore: doubtless that is in no wise good, through which the
   supreme good is subjected to change or corruption. But, if any lesser
   nature derives existence from the material of the supreme good,
   inasmuch as nothing exists whencesoever, except through the supreme
   Being, the supreme good is subjected to change and corruption through
   the supreme Being itself. Hence, the supreme Being, which is itself the
   supreme good, is by no means good; which is a contradiction. There is,
   therefore, no lesser nature which derives existence in a material way
   from the supreme Nature.

   Since, then, it is evident that the essence of those things which exist
   through another does not derive existence as if materially, from the
   supreme Essence, nor from itself, nor from another, it is manifest that
   it derives existence from no material. Hence, seeing that whatever is
   exists through the supreme Being, nor can aught else exist through this
   Being, except by its creation, or by its existence as material, it
   follows, necessarily, that nothing besides it exists, except by its
   creation. And, since nothing else is or has been, except that supreme
   Being and the beings created by it, it could create nothing at all
   through any other instrument or aid than itself. But all that it has
   created, it has doubtless created either from something, as from
   material, or from nothing.

   Since, then, it is most patent that the essence of all beings, except
   the supreme Essence, was created by that supreme Essence, and derives
   existence from no material, doubtless nothing can be more clear than
   that this supreme Essence nevertheless produced from nothing, alone and
   through itself, the world of material things, so numerous a multitude,
   formed in such beauty, varied in such order, so fitly diversified.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

   How it is to be understood that this Nature created all things from
   nothing.

   BUT we are confronted with a doubt regarding this term nothing. For,
   from whatever source anything is created, that source is the cause of
   what is created from it, and, necessarily, every cause affords some
   assistance to the being of what it effects. This is so firmly believed,
   as a result of experience, by every one, that the belief can be wrested
   from no one by argument, and can scarcely be purloined by sophistry.

   Accordingly, if anything was created from nothing, this very nothing
   was the cause of what was created from it. But how could that which had
   no existence, assist anything in coming into existence? If, however, no
   aid to the existence of anything ever had its source in nothing, who
   can be convinced, and how, that anything is created out of nothing?

   Moreover, nothing either means something, or does not mean something.
   But if nothing is something, whatever has been created from nothing has
   been created from something. If, however, nothing is not something;
   since it is inconceivable that anything should be created from what
   does not exist, nothing is created from nothing; just as all agree that
   nothing comes from nothing. Whence, it evidently follows, that whatever
   is created is created from something; for it is created either from
   something or from nothing. Whether, then, nothing is something, or
   nothing is not something, it apparently follows, that whatever has been
   created was created from something.

   But, if this is posited as a truth, then it is so posited in opposition
   to the whole argument propounded in the preceding chapter. Hence, since
   what was nothing will thus be something, that which was something in
   the highest degree will be nothing. For, from the discovery of a
   certain Substance existing in the greatest degree of all existing
   beings, my reasoning had brought me to this conclusion, that all other
   beings were so created by this Substance, that that from which they
   were created was nothing. Hence, if that from which they were created,
   which I supposed to be nothing, is something, whatever I supposed to
   have been ascertained regarding the supreme Being, is nothing.

   What, then, is to be our understanding of the term nothing?--For I have
   already determined not to neglect in this meditation any possible
   objection, even if it be almost foolish.--In three ways, then--and this
   suffices for the removal of the present obstacle--can the statement
   that any substance was created from nothing be explained.

   There is one way, according to which we wish it to be understood, that
   what is said to have been created from nothing has not been created at
   all; just as, to one who asks regarding a dumb man, of what he speaks,
   the answer is given, "of nothing," that is, he does not speak at all.
   According to this interpretation, to one who enquires regarding the
   supreme Being, or regarding what never has existed and does not exist
   at all, as to whence it was created, the answer, "from nothing" may
   properly be given; that is, it never was created. But this answer is
   unintelligible in the case of any of those things that actually were
   created.

   There is another interpretation which is, indeed, capable of
   supposition, but cannot be true; namely, that if anything is said to
   have been created from nothing, it was created from nothing itself (de
   nihilo ipso), that is, from what does not exist at all, as if this very
   nothing were some existent being, from which something could be
   created. But, since this is always false, as often as it is assumed an
   irreconcilable contradiction follows.

   There is a third interpretation, according to which a thing is said to
   have been created from nothing, when we understand that it was indeed
   created, but that there is not anything whence it was created.
   Apparently it is said with a like meaning, when a man is afflicted
   without cause, that he is afflicted "over nothing."

   If, then, the conclusion reached in the preceding chapter is understood
   in this sense, that with the exception of the supreme Being all things
   have been created by that Being from nothing, that is, not from
   anything; just as this conclusion consistently follows the preceding
   arguments, so, from it, nothing inconsistent is inferred; although it
   may be said, without inconsistency or any contradiction, that what has
   been created by the creative Substance was created from nothing, in the
   way that one frequently says a rich man has been made from a poor man,
   or that one has recovered health from sickness; that is, he who was
   poor before, is rich now, as he was not before; and he who was ill
   before, is well now, as he was not before.

   In this way, then, we can understand, without inconsistency, the
   statement that the creative Being created all things from nothing, or
   that all were created through it from nothing; that is, those things
   which before were nothing, are now something. For, indeed, from the
   very word that we use, saying that it created them or that they were
   created, we understand that when this Being created them, it created
   something, and that when they were created, they were created only as
   something. For so, beholding a man of very lowly fortunes exalted with
   many riches and honors by some one, we say, "Lo, he has made that man
   out of nothing"; that is, the man who was before reputed as nothing is
   now, by virtue of that other's making, truly reckoned as something.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

   Those things which were created from nothing had an existence before
   their creation in the thought of the Creator.

   BUT I seem to see a truth that compels me to distinguish carefully in
   what sense those things which were created may be said to have been
   nothing before their creation. For, in no wise can anything conceivably
   be created by any, unless there is, in the mind of the creative agent,
   some example, as it were, or (as is more fittingly supposed) some
   model, or likeness , or rule. It is evident, then, that before the
   world was created, it was in the thought of the supreme Nature, what,
   and of what sort, and how, it should be. Hence, although it is clear
   that the beings that were created were nothing before their creation,
   to this extent, that they were not what they now are, nor was there
   anything whence they should be created, yet they were not nothing, so
   far as the creator's thought is concerned, through which, and according
   to which, they were created.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

   This thought is a kind of expression of the objects created (locutio
   rerum), like the expression which an artisan forms in his mind for what
   he intends to make.

   BUT this model of things, which preceded their creation in the thought
   of the creator, what else is it than a kind of expression of these
   things in his thought itself; just as when an artisan is about to make
   something after the manner of his craft, he first expresses it to
   himself through a concept? But by the expression of the mind or reason
   I mean, here, not the conception of words signifying the objects, but
   the general view in the mind, by the vision of conception, of the
   objects themselves, whether destined to be, or already existing.

   For, from frequent usage, it is recognised that we can express the same
   object in three ways. For we express objects either by the sensible use
   of sensible signs, that is, signs which are perceptible to the bodily
   senses; or by thinking within ourselves insensibly of these signs
   which, when outwardly used, are sensible; or not by employing these
   signs, either sensibly or insensibly, but by expressing the things
   themselves inwardly in our mind, whether by the power of imagining
   material bodies or of understanding thought, according to the diversity
   of these objects themselves.

   For I express a man in one way, when I signify him by pronouncing these
   words, a man; in another, when I think of the same words in silence;
   and in another, when the mind regards the man himself, either through
   the image of his body, or through the reason; through the image of his
   body, when the mind imagines his visible form; through the reason,
   however, when it thinks of his universal essence, which is a rational,
   mortal animal.

   Now, the first two kinds of expression are in the language of one's
   race. But the words of that kind of expression, which I have put third
   and last, when they concern objects well known, are natural, and are
   the same among all nations. And, since all other words owe their
   invention to these, where these are, no other word is necessary for the
   recognition of an object, and where they cannot be, no other word is of
   any use for the description of an object.

   For, without absurdity, they may also be said to be the truer, the more
   like they are to the objects to which they correspond, and the more
   expressively they signify these objects. For, with the exception of
   those objects, which we employ as their own names, in order to signify
   them, like certain sounds, the vowel a for instance--with the exception
   of these, I say, no other word appears so similar to the object to
   which it is applied, or expresses it as does that likeness which is
   expressed by the vision of the mind thinking of the object itself.

   This last, then, should be called the especially proper and primary
   word, corresponding to the thing. Hence, if no expression of any object
   whatever so nearly approaches the object as that expression which
   consists of this sort of words, nor can there be in the thought of any
   another word so like the object, whether destined to be, or already
   existing, not without reason it may be thought that such an expression
   of objects existed with (apud) the supreme Substance before their
   creation, that they might be created; and exists, now that they have
   been created, that they may be known through it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

   The analogy, however, between the expression of the Creator and the
   expression of the artisan is very incomplete.

   BUT, though it is most certain that the supreme Substance expressed, as
   it were, within itself the whole created world, which it established
   according to, and through, this same most profound expression, just as
   an artisan first conceives in his mind what he afterwards actually
   executes in accordance with his mental concept, yet I see that this
   analogy is very incomplete.

   For the supreme Substance took absolutely nothing from any other
   source, whence it might either frame a model in itself, or make its
   creatures what they are; while the artisan is wholly unable to conceive
   in his imagination any bodily thing, except what he has in some way
   learned from external objects, whether all at once, or part by part;
   nor can he perform the work mentally conceived, if there is a lack of
   material, or of anything without which a work premeditated cannot be
   performed. For, though a man can, by meditation or representation,
   frame the idea of some sort of animal, such as has no existence; yet,
   by no means has he the power to do this, except by uniting in this idea
   the parts that he has gathered in his memory from objects known
   externally.

   Hence, in this respect, these inner expressions of the works they are
   to create differ in the creative substance and in the artisan: that the
   former expression, without being taken or aided from any external
   source, but as first and sole cause, could suffice the Artificer for
   the performance of his work, while the latter is neither first, nor
   sole, nor sufficient, cause for the inception of the artisan's work.
   Therefore, whatever has been created through the former expression is
   only what it is through that expression, while whatever has been
   created through the latter would not exist at all, unless it were
   something that it is not through this expression itself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

   This expression of the supreme Being is the supreme Being.

   BUT since, as our reasoning shows, it is equally certain that whatever
   the supreme Substance created, it created through nothing other than
   itself; and whatever it created, it created through its own most
   intimate expression, whether separately, by the utterance of separate
   words, or all at once, by the utterance of one word; what conclusion
   can be more evidently necessary, than that this expression of the
   supreme Being is no other than the supreme Being? Therefore, the
   consideration of this expression should not, in my opinion, be
   carelessly passed over. But before it can be discussed, I think some of
   the properties of this supreme Substance should be diligently and
   earnestly investigated.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

   As all things were created through the supreme Being, so all live
   through it.

   IT is certain, then, that through the supreme Nature whatever is not
   identical with it has been created. But no rational mind can doubt that
   all creatures live and continue to exist, so long as they do exist, by
   the sustenance afforded by that very Being through whose creative act
   they are endowed with the existence that they have. For, by a like
   course of reasoning to that by which it has been gathered that all
   existing beings exist through some one being, hence that being alone
   exists through itself, and others through another than themselves--by a
   like course of reasoning, I say, it can be proved that whatever things
   live, live through some one being; hence that being alone lives through
   itself, and others through another than themselves.

   But, since it cannot but be that those things which have been created
   live through another, and that by which they have been created lives
   through itself, necessarily, just as nothing has been created except
   through the creative, present Being, so nothing lives except through
   its preserving presence.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

   This Being is in all things, and throughout all; and all derive
   existence from it and exist through and in it.

   BUT if this is true--rather, since this must be true, it follows that,
   where this Being is not, nothing is. It is, then, everywhere, and
   throughout all things, and in all. But seeing that it is manifestly
   absurd that as any created being can in no wise exceed the
   immeasurableness of what creates and cherishes it, so the creative and
   cherishing Being cannot, in any way, exceed the sum of the things it
   has created; it is clear that this Being itself, is what supports and
   surpasses, includes and permeates all other things. If we unite this
   truth with the truths already discovered, we find it is this same Being
   which is in all and through all, and from which, and through which, and
   in which, all exist.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

   What can or cannot be stated concerning the substance of this Being.

   NOT without reason I am now strongly impelled to inquire as earnestly
   as I am able, which of all the statements that may be made regarding
   anything is substantially applicable to this so wonderful Nature. For,
   though I should be surprised if, among the names or words by which we
   designate things created from nothing, any should be found that could
   worthily be applied to the Substance which is the creator of all; yet,
   we must try and see to what end reason will lead this investigation.

   As to relative expressions, at any rate, no one can doubt that no such
   expression describes what is essential to that in regard to which it is
   relatively employed. Hence, if any relative predication is made
   regarding the supreme Nature, it is not significant of its substance.

   Therefore, it is manifest that this very expression, that this Nature,
   is the highest of all beings, or greater than those which have been
   created by it; or any other relative term that can, in like manner, be
   applied to it, does not describe its natural essence.

   For, if none of those things ever existed, in relation to which it is
   called supreme or greater, it would not be conceived as either supreme
   or greater, yet it would not, therefore, be less good, or suffer
   detriment to its essential greatness in any degree. And this truth is
   clearly seen from the fact that this Nature exists through no other
   than itself, whatever there be that is good or great. If, then, the
   supreme Nature can be so conceived of as not supreme, that still it
   shall be in no wise greater or less than when it is conceived of as the
   highest of all beings, it is manifest that the term supreme, taken by
   itself, does not describe that Being which is altogether greater and
   better than whatever is not what it is. But, what these considerations
   show regarding the term supreme or highest is found to be true, in like
   manner, of other similar, relative expressions.

   Passing over these relative predications, then, since none of them
   taken by itself represents the essence of anything, let our attention
   be turned to the discussion of other kinds of predication.

   Now, certainly if one diligently considers separately whatever there is
   that is not of a relative nature, either it is such that, to be it is
   in general better than not to be it, or such that, in some cases, not
   to be it is better than to be it. But I here understand the phrases, to
   be it and not to be it, in the same way in which I understand to be
   true and not to be true, to be bodily and not to be bodily, and the
   like. Indeed, to be anything is, in general, better than not to be it;
   as to be wise is better than not to be so; that is, it is better to be
   wise than not to be wise. For, though one who is just, but not wise, is
   apparently a better man than one who is wise, but not just, yet, taken
   by itself, it is not better not to be wise than to be wise. For,
   everything that is not wise, simply in so far as it is not wise, is
   less than what is wise, since everything that is not wise would be
   better if it were wise. In the same way, to be true is altogether
   better than not to be so, that is, better than not to be true; and just
   is better than not just; and to live than not to live.

   But, in some cases, not to be a certain thing is better than to be it,
   as not to be gold may be better than to be gold. For it is better for
   man not to be gold, than to be gold; although it might be better for
   something to be gold, than not to be gold--lead, for instance. For
   though both, namely, man and lead are not gold, man is something as
   much better than gold, as he would be of inferior nature, were he gold;
   while lead is something as much more base than gold, as it would be
   more precious, were it gold.

   But, from the fact that the supreme Nature may be so conceived of as
   not supreme, that supreme is neither in general better than not
   supreme, nor not supreme better, in any case, than supreme--from this
   fact it is evident that there are many relative expressions which are
   by no means included in this classification. Whether, however, any are
   so included, I refrain from inquiring; since it is sufficient, for my
   purpose, that undoubtedly none of these, taken by itself, describes the
   substance of the supreme Nature.

   Since, then, it is true of whatever else there is, that, if it is taken
   independently, to be it is better than not to be it; as it is impious
   to suppose that the substance of the supreme Nature is anything, than
   which what is not it is in any way better, it must be true that this
   substance is whatever is, in general, better than what is not it. For,
   it alone is that, than which there is nothing better at all, and which
   is better than all things, which are not what it is.

   It is not a material body, then, or any of those things which the
   bodily senses discern. For, then all these there is something better,
   which is not what they themselves are. For, the rational mind, as to
   which no bodily sense can perceive what, or of what character, or how
   great, it is--the less this rational mind would be if it were any of
   those things that are in the scope of the bodily senses, the greater it
   is than any of these. For by no means should this supreme Being be said
   to be any of those things to which something, which they themselves are
   not, is superior; and it should by all means, as our reasoning shows,
   be said to be any of those things to which everything, which is not
   what they themselves are, is inferior.

   Hence, this Being must be living, wise, powerful, and all-powerful,
   true, just, blessed, eternal, and whatever, in like manner, is
   absolutely better than what is not it. Why, then, should we make any
   further inquiry as to what that supreme Nature is, if it is manifest
   which of all things it is, and which it is not?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

   For this Being it is the same to be just that it is to be justice; and
   so with regard to attributes that can be expressed in the same way: and
   none of these shows of what character, or how great, but what this
   Being is.

   BUT perhaps, when this Being is called just, or great, or anything like
   these, it is not shown what it is, but of what character, or how great
   it is. For every such term seems to be used with reference to quantity
   or magnitude; because everything that is just is so through justness,
   and so with other like cases, in the same way. Hence, the supreme
   Nature itself is not just, except through justness.

   It seems, then, that by participation in this quality, that is,
   justness, the supremely good Substance is called just. But, if this is
   so, it is just through another, and not through itself. But this is
   contrary to the truth already established, that it is good, or great or
   whatever it is at all, through itself and not through another. So, if
   it is not just, except through justness, and cannot be just, except
   through itself, what can be more clear than that this Nature is itself
   justness? And, when it is said to be just through justness, it is the
   same as saying that it is just through itself. And, when it is said to
   be just through itself, nothing else is understood than that it is just
   through justness. Hence, if it is inquired what the supreme Nature,
   which is in question, is in itself, what truer answer can be given,
   than Justness?

   We must observe, then, how we are to understand the statement, that the
   Nature which is itself justness is just. For, since a man cannot be
   justness, but can possess justness, we do not conceive of a just man as
   being justness, but as possessing justness. Since, on the other hand,
   it cannot properly be said of the supreme Nature that it possesses
   justness, but that it is justness, when it is called just it is
   properly conceived of as being justness, but not as possessing
   justness. Hence, if, when it is said to be justness, it is not said of
   what character it is, but what it is, it follows that, when it is
   called just, it is not said of what character it is, but what it is.

   Therefore, seeing that it is the same to say of the supreme Being, that
   it is just and that it is justness; and, when it is said that it is
   justness, it is nothing else than saying that it is just; it makes no
   difference whether it is said to be justness or to be just. Hence, when
   one is asked regarding the supreme Nature, what it is, the answer,
   Just, is not less fitting than the answer, Justness. Moreover, what we
   see to have been proved in the case of justness, the intellect is
   compelled to acknowledge as true of all attributes which are similarly
   predicated of this supreme Nature. Whatever such attribute is
   predicated of it, then, it is shown, not of what character, or how
   great, but what it is.

   But it is obvious that whatever good thing the supreme Nature is, it is
   in the highest degree. It is, therefore, supreme Being, supreme
   Justness, supreme Wisdom, supreme Truth, supreme Goodness, supreme
   Greatness, supreme Beauty, supreme Immortality, supreme
   Incorruptibility, supreme Immutability, supreme Blessedness, supreme
   Eternity, supreme Power, supreme Unity; which is nothing else than
   supremely being, supremely living, etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

   It is simple in such a way that all things that can be said of its
   essence are one and the same in it: and nothing can be said of its
   substance except in terms of what it is.

   IS it to be inferred, then, that if the supreme Nature is so many
   goods, it will therefore be compounded of more goods than one? Or is it
   true, rather, that there are not more goods than one, but a single good
   described by many names? For, everything which is composite requires
   for its subsistence the things of which it is compounded, and, indeed,
   owes to them the fact of its existence, because, whatever it is, it is
   through these things; and they are not what they are through it, and
   therefore it is not at all supreme. If, then, that Nature is compounded
   of more goods than one, all these facts that are true of every
   composite must be applicable to it. But this impious falsehood the
   whole cogency of the truth that was shown above refutes and overthrows,
   through a clear argument.

   Since, then, that Nature is by no means composite and yet is by all
   means those so many goods, necessarily all these are not more than one,
   but are one. Any one of them is, therefore, the same as all, whether
   taken all at once or separately. Therefore, just as whatever is
   attributed to the essence of the supreme Substance is one; so this
   substance is whatever it is essentially in one way, and by virtue of
   one consideration. For, when a man is said to be a material body, and
   rational, and human, these three things are not said in one way, or in
   virtue of one consideration. For, in accordance with one fact, he is a
   material body; and in accordance with another, rational; and no one of
   these, taken by itself, is the whole of what man is.

   That supreme Being, however, is by no means anything in such a way that
   it is not this same thing, according to another way, or another
   consideration; because, whatever it is essentially in any way, this is
   all of what it is. Therefore, nothing that is truly said of the supreme
   Being is accepted in terms of quality or quantity, but only in terms of
   what it is. For, whatever it is in terms of either quality or quantity
   would constitute still another element, in terms of what it is; hence,
   it would not be simple, but composite.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

   It is without beginning and without end.

   FROM what time, then, has this so simple Nature which creates and
   animates all things existed, or until what time is it to exist? Or
   rather, let us ask neither from what time, nor to what time, it exists;
   but is it without beginning and without end? For, if it has a
   beginning, it has this either from or through itself, or from or
   through another, or from or through nothing.

   But it is certain, according to truths already made plain, that in no
   wise does it derive existence from another, or from nothing; or exist
   through another, or through nothing. In no wise, therefore, has it had
   inception through or from another, or through or from nothing.

   Moreover, it cannot have inception from or through itself, although it
   exists from and through itself. For it so exists from and through
   itself, that by no means is there one essence which exists from and
   through itself, and another through which, and from which, it exists.
   But, whatever begins to exist from or through something, is by no means
   identical with that from or through which it begins to exist.
   Therefore, the supreme Nature does not begin through or from, itself.

   Seeing, then, that it has a beginning neither through nor from itself,
   and neither through nor from nothing, it assuredly has no beginning at
   all. But neither will it have an end. For, if it is to have end, it is
   not supremely immortal and supremely incorruptible . But we have proved
   that it is supremely immortal and supremely incorruptible. Therefore,
   it will not have an end.

   Furthermore, if it is to have an end, it will perish either willingly
   or against its will. But certainly that is not a simple, unmixed good,
   at whose will the supreme good perishes. But this Being is itself the
   true and simple, unmixed good. Therefore, that very Being, which is
   certainly the supreme good, will not die of its own will. If, however,
   it is to perish against its will, it is not supremely powerful, or
   all-powerful. But cogent reasoning has asserted it to be powerful and
   all-powerful. Therefore, it will not die against its will. Hence, if
   neither with nor against its will the supreme Nature is to have an end,
   in no way will it have an end.

   Again, if the supreme nature has an end or a beginning, it is not true
   eternity, which it has been irrefutably proved to be above.

   Then, let him who can conceive of a time when this began to be true, or
   when it was not true, namely, that something was destined to be; or
   when this shall cease to be true, and shall not be true, namely, that
   something has existed. But, if neither of these suppositions is
   conceivable, and both these facts cannot exist without truth, it is
   impossible even to conceive that truth has either beginning or end. And
   then, if truth had a beginning, or shall have an end; before it began
   it was true that truth did not exist, and after it shall be ended it
   will be true that truth will not exist. Yet, anything that is true
   cannot exist without truth. Therefore, truth existed before truth
   existed, and truth will exist after truth shall be ended, which is a
   most contradictory conclusion. Whether, then, truth is said to have, or
   understood not to have, beginning or end, it cannot be limited by any
   beginning or end. Hence, the same follows as regards the supreme
   Nature, since it is itself the supreme Truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

   In what sense nothing existed before or will exist after this Being.

   BUT here we are again confronted by the term nothing, and whatever our
   reasoning thus far, with the concordant attestation of truth and
   necessity, has concluded nothing to be. For, if the propositions duly
   set forth above have been confirmed by the fortification of logically
   necessary truth, not anything existed before the supreme Being, nor
   will anything exist after it. Hence, nothing existed before, and
   nothing will exist after, it. For, either something or nothing must
   have preceded it; and either something or nothing must be destined to
   follow it.

   But, he who says that nothing existed before it appears to make this
   statement, "that there was before it a time when nothing existed, and
   that there will be after it a time when nothing will exist." Therefore,
   when nothing existed, that Being did not exist, and when nothing shall
   exist, that Being will not exist. How is it, then, that it does not
   take inception from nothing or how is it that it will not come to
   nothing?--if that Being did not yet exist, when nothing already
   existed; and the same Being shall no longer exist, when nothing shall
   still exist. Of what avail is so weighty a mass of arguments, if this
   nothing so easily demolishes their structure? For, if it is established
   that the supreme Being succeeds nothing [11] which precedes it, and
   yields its place to nothing, which follows it, whatever has been
   posited as true above is necessarily unsettled by empty nothing.

   But, rather ought this nothing to be resisted, lest so many structures
   of cogent reasoning be stormed by nothing; and the supreme good, which
   has been sought and found by the light of truth, be lost for nothing.
   Let it rather be declared, then, that nothing did not exist before the
   supreme Being, and that nothing will not exist after it, rather than
   that, when a place is given before or after it to nothing, that Being
   which through itself brought into existence what was nothing, should be
   reduced through nothing to nothing.

   For this one assertion, namely, that nothing existed before the supreme
   Being, carries two meanings. For, one sense of this statement is that,
   before the supreme Being, there was a time when nothing was. But
   another understanding of the same statement is that, before the supreme
   Being, not anything existed. Just as, supposing I should say, "Nothing
   has taught me to fly," I could explain this assertion either in this
   way, that nothing, as an entity in itself, which signifies not
   anything, has taught me actually to fly--which would be false; or in
   this way, that not anything has taught me to fly, which would be true.

   The former interpretation, therefore, which is followed by the
   inconsistency discussed above, is rejected by all reasoning as false.
   But there remains the other interpretation, which unites in perfect
   consistency with the foregoing arguments, and which, from the force of
   their whole correlation, must be true.

   Hence, the statement that nothing existed before that Being must be
   received in the latter sense. Nor should it be so explained, that it
   shall be understood that there was any time when that Being did not
   exist, and nothing did exist; but, so that it shall be understood that,
   before that Being, there was not anything. The same sort of double
   signification is found in the statement that nothing will exist after
   that Being.

   If, then, this interpretation of the term nothing, that has been given,
   is carefully analysed, most truly neither something nor nothing
   preceded or will follow the supreme Being, and the conclusion is
   reached, that nothing existed before or will exist after it. Yet, the
   solidity of the truths already established is in no wise impaired by
   the emptiness of nothing.

  CHAPTER XX.

   It exists in every place and at every time.

   BUT, although it has been concluded above that this creative Nature
   exists everywhere, and in all things, and through all; and from the
   fact that it neither began, nor will cease to be, it follows that it
   always has been, and is, and will be; yet, I perceive a certain secret
   murmur of contradiction which compels me to inquire more carefully
   where and when that Nature exists.

   The supreme Being, then, exists either everywhere and always, or merely
   at some place and time, or nowhere and never: or, as I express it,
   either in every place and at every time, or finitely, in some place and
   at some time, or in no place and at no time.

   But what can be more obviously contradictory, than that what exists
   most really and supremely exists nowhere and never? It is, therefore,
   false that it exists nowhere and never. Again, since there is no good,
   nor anything at all without it; if this Being itself exists nowhere or
   never, then nowhere or never is there any good, and nowhere and never
   is there anything at all. But there is no need to state that this is
   false. Hence, the former proposition is also false, that that Being
   exists nowhere and never.

   It therefore exists finitely, at some time and place, or everywhere and
   always. But, if it exists finitely, at some place or time, there and
   then only, where and when it exists, can anything exist. Where and when
   it does not exist, moreover, there is no existence at all, because,
   without it, nothing exists. Whence it will follow, that there is some
   place and time where and when nothing at all exists. But seeing that
   this is false--for place and time themselves are existing things--the
   supreme Nature cannot exist finitely, at some place or time. But, if it
   is said that it of itself exists finitely, at some place and time, but
   that, through its power, it is wherever and whenever anything is, this
   is not true. For, since it is manifest that its power is nothing else
   than itself, by no means does its power exist without it.

   Since, then, it does not exist finitely, at some place or time, it must
   exist everywhere and always, that is, in every place and at every time.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

   It exists in no place or time.

   BUT, if this is true, either it exists in every place and at every
   time, or else only a part of it so exists, the other part transcending
   every place and time.

   But, if in part it exists, and in part does not exist, in every place
   and at every time, it has parts; which is false. It does not,
   therefore, exist everywhere and always in part.

   But how does it exist as a whole, everywhere and always? For, either it
   is to be understood that it exists as a whole at once, in all places or
   at all times, and by parts in individual places and times; or, that it
   exists as a whole, in individual places and times as well.

   But, if it exists by parts in individual places or times, it is not
   exempt from composition and division of parts; which has been found to
   be in a high degree alien to the supreme Nature. Hence, it does not so
   exist, as a whole, in all places and at all times that it exists by
   parts in individual places and times.

   We are confronted, then, by the former alternative, that is, how the
   supreme Nature can exist, as a whole, in every individual place and
   time. This is doubtless impossible, unless it either exists at once or
   at different times in individual places or times. But, since the law of
   place and the law of time, the investigation of which it has hitherto
   been possible to prosecute in a single discussion, because they
   advanced on exactly the same lines, here separate one from another and
   seem to avoid debate, as if by evasion in diverse directions, let each
   be investigated independently in discussion directed on itself alone.

   First, then, let us see whether the supreme Nature can exist, as a
   whole, in individual places, either at once in all, or at different
   times, in different places. Then, let us make the same inquiry
   regarding the times at which it can exist.

   If, then, it exists as a whole in each individual place, then, for each
   individual place there is an individual whole. For, just as place is so
   distinguished from place that there are individual places, so that
   which exists as a whole, in one place, is so distinct from that which
   exists as a whole at the same time, in another place, that there are
   individual wholes. For, of what exists as a whole, in any place, there
   is no part that does not exist in that place. And that of which there
   is no part that does not exist in a given place, is no part of what
   exists at the same time outside this place.

   What exists as a whole, then, in any place, is no part of what exists
   at the same time outside that place. But, of that of which no part
   exists outside any given place, no part exists, at the same time, in
   another place. How, then, can what exists as a whole, in any place,
   exist simultaneously, as a whole, in another place, if no part of it
   can at that time exist in another place?

   Since, then, one whole cannot exist as a whole in different places at
   the same time, it follows that, for individual places, there are
   individual wholes, if anything is to exist as a whole in different
   individual places at once. Hence, if the supreme Nature exists as a
   whole, at one time, in every individual place, there are as many
   supreme Natures as there can be individual places; which it would be
   irrational to believe. Therefore, it does not exist, as a whole, at one
   time in individual places.

   If, however, at different times it exists, as a whole, in individual
   places, then, when it is in one place, there is in the meantime no good
   and no existence in other places, since without it absolutely nothing
   exists. But the absurdity of this supposition is proved by the
   existence of places themselves, which are not nothing, but something.
   Therefore, the supreme Nature does not exist, as a whole, in individual
   places at different times.

   But, if neither at the same time nor at different times does it exist,
   as a whole, in individual places, it is evident that it does not at all
   exist, as a whole, in each individual place. We must now examine, then,
   whether this supreme Nature exists, as a whole, at individual times,
   either simultaneously or at distinct times for individual times.

   But, how can anything exist, as a whole, simultaneously, at individual
   times, if these times are not themselves simultaneous? But, if this
   Being exists, as a whole, separately and at distinct times for
   individual times, just as a man exists as a whole yesterday, to-day,
   and to-morrow; it is properly said that it was and is and will be. Its
   age, then, which is no other than its eternity, does not exist, as a
   whole, simultaneously, but it is distributed in parts according to the
   parts of time.

   But its eternity is nothing else than itself. The supreme Being, then,
   will be divided into parts, according to the divisions of time. For, if
   its age is prolonged through periods of time, it has with this time
   present, past, and future. But what else is its age than its duration
   of existence, than its eternity? Since, then, its eternity is nothing
   else than its essence, as considerations set forth above irrefutably
   prove; if its eternity has past, present, and future, its essence also
   has, in consequence, past, present, and future.

   But what is past is not present or future; and what is present is not
   past or future; and what is future is not past or present. How, then,
   shall that proposition be valid, which was proved with clear and
   logical cogency above, namely, that that supreme Nature is in no wise
   composite, but is supremely simple, supremely immutable?--how shall
   this be so, if that Nature is one thing, at one time, and another, at
   another, and has parts distributed according to times? Or rather, if
   these earlier propositions are true, how can these latter be possible?
   By no means, then, is past or future attributable to the creative
   Being, either its age or its eternity. For why has it not a present, if
   it truly is? But was means past, and will be future. Therefore that
   Being never was, nor will be. Hence, it does not exist at distinct
   times, just as it does not exist, as a whole, simultaneously in
   different individual times.

   If, then, as our discussion has proved, it neither so exists, as a
   whole, in all places or times that it exists, as a whole, at one time
   in all, or by parts in individual places and times; nor so that it
   exists, as a whole, in individual times and places, it is manifest that
   it does not in any way exist, as a whole, in every time or place.

   And, since, in like manner, it has been demonstrated that it neither so
   exists in every time or place, that a part exists in every, and a part
   transcends every, place and time, it is impossible that it exists
   everywhere and always.

   For, in no way can it be conceived to exist everywhere and always,
   except either as a whole or in part. But if it does not at all exist
   everywhere and always, it will exist either finitely in some place or
   time, or in none. But it has already been proved, that it cannot exist
   finitely, in any place or time. In no place or time, that is, nowhere
   and never does it exist. For it cannot exist, except in every or in
   some place or time.

   But, on the other hand, since it is irrefutably established, not only
   that it exists through itself, and without beginning and without end,
   but that without it nothing anywhere or ever exists, it must exist
   everywhere and always.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

   How it exists in every place and time, and in none.

   HOW, then, shall these prepositions, that are so necessary according to
   our exposition, and so necessary according to our proof, be reconciled?
   Perhaps the supreme Nature exists in place and time in some such way,
   that it is not prevented from so existing simultaneously, as a whole,
   in different places or times, that there are not more wholes than one;
   and that its age, which does not exist, except as true eternity, is not
   distributed among past, present, and future.

   For, to this law of space and time, nothing seems to be subject, except
   the beings which so exist in space or time that they do not transcend
   extent of space or duration of time. Hence, though of beings of this
   class it is with all truth asserted that one and the same whole cannot
   exist simultaneously, as a whole, in different places or times; in the
   case of those beings which are not of this class, no such conclusion is
   necessarily reached.

   For it seems to be rightly said, that place is predicable only of
   objects whose magnitude place contains by including it, and includes by
   containing it; and that time is predicable only of objects whose
   duration time ends by measuring it, and measures by ending it. Hence,
   to any being, to whose spatial extent or duration no bound can be set,
   either by space or time, no place or time is properly attributed. For,
   seeing that place does not act upon it as place, nor time as time, it
   is not irrational to say, that no place is its place, and no time its
   time.

   But, what evidently has no place or time is doubtless by no means
   compelled to submit to the law of place or time. No law of place or
   time, then, in any way governs any nature, which no place or time
   limits by some kind of restraint. But what rational consideration can
   by any course of reasoning fail to reach the conclusion, that the
   Substance which creates and is supreme among all beings, which must be
   alien to, and free from, the nature and law of all things which itself
   created from nothing, is limited by no restraint of space or time;
   since, more truly, its power, which is nothing else than its essence,
   contains and includes under itself all these things which it created?

   Is it not impudently foolish, too, to say either, that space
   circumscribes the magnitude of truth, or, that time measures its
   duration--truth, which regards no greatness or smallness of spatial or
   temporal extent at all?

   Seeing, then, that this is the condition of place or time; that only
   whatever is limited by their bounds neither escapes the law of
   parts--such as place follows, according to magnitude, or such as time
   submits to, according to duration--nor can in any way be contained, as
   a whole, simultaneously by different places or times; but whatever is
   in no wise confined by the restraint of place or time, is not compelled
   by any law of places or times to multiplicity of parts, nor is it
   prevented from being present, as a whole and simultaneously, in more
   places or times than one--seeing, I say, that this is the condition
   governing place or time, no doubt the supreme Substance, which is
   encompassed by no restraint of place or time, is bound by none of their
   laws.

   Hence, since inevitable necessity requires that the supreme Being, as a
   whole, be lacking to no place or time, and no law of place or time
   prevents it from being simultaneously in every place or time; it must
   be simultaneously present in every individual place or time. For,
   because it is present in one place, it is not therefore prevented from
   being present at the same time, and in like manner in this, or that
   other, place or time.

   Nor, because it was, or is, or shall be, has any part of its eternity
   therefore vanished from the present, with the past, which no longer is;
   nor does it pass with the present, which is, for an instant; nor is it
   to come with the future, which is not yet.

   For, by no means is that Being compelled or forbidden by a law of space
   or time to exist, or not to exist, at any place or time--the Being
   which, in no wise, includes its own existence in space or time. For,
   when the supreme Being is said to exist in space or time, although the
   form of expression regarding it, and regarding local and temporal
   natures, is the same, because of the usage of language, yet the sense
   is different, because of the unlikeness of the objects of discussion.
   For in the latter case the same expression has two meanings, namely:
   (1) that these objects are present in those places and times in which
   they are said to be, and (2) that they are contained by these places
   and times themselves.

   But in the case of the supreme Being, the first sense only is intended,
   namely, that it is present; not that it is also contained. If the usage
   of language permitted, it would, therefore, seem to be more fittingly
   said, that it exists with place or time, than that it exists in place
   or time. For the statement that a thing exists in another implies that
   it is contained, more than does the statement that it exists with
   another.

   In no place or time, then, is this Being properly said to exist, since
   it is contained by no other at all. And yet it may be said, after a
   manner of its own, to be in every place or time, since whatever else
   exists is sustained by its presence, lest it lapse into nothingness. It
   exists in every place and time, because it is absent from none; and it
   exists in none, because it has no place or time, and has not taken to
   itself distinctions of place or time, neither here nor there, nor
   anywhere, nor then, nor now, nor at any time; nor does it exist in
   terms of this fleeting present, in which we live, nor has it existed,
   nor will it exist, in terms of past or future, since these are
   restricted to things finite and mutable, which it is not.

   And yet, these properties of time and place can, in some sort, be
   ascribed to it, since it is just as truly present in all finite and
   mutable beings as if it were circumscribed by the same places, and
   suffered change by the same times.

   We have sufficient evidence, then, to dispel the contradiction that
   threatened us; as to how the highest Being of all exists, everywhere
   and always, and nowhere and never, that is, in every place and time,
   and in no place or time, according to the consistent truth of different
   senses of the terms employed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

   How it is better conceived to exist everywhere than in every place

   BUT, since it is plain that this supreme Nature is not more truly in
   all places than in all existing things, not as if it were contained by
   them, but as containing all, by permeating all, why should it not be
   said to be everywhere, in this sense, that it may be understood rather
   to be in all existing things, than merely in all places, since this
   sense is supported by the truth of the fact, and is not forbidden by
   the proper signification of the word of place?

   For we often quite properly apply terms of place to objects which are
   not places; as, when I say that the understanding is there in the soul,
   where rationality is. For, though there and where are adverbs of place,
   yet, by no local limitation, does the mind contain anything, nor is
   either rationality or understanding contained.

   Hence, as regards the truth of the matter, the supreme Nature is more
   appropriately said to be everywhere, in this sense, that it is in all
   existing things, than in this sense, namely that it is merely in all
   places. And since, as the reasons set forth above show, it cannot exist
   otherwise, it must so be in all existing things, that it is one and the
   same perfect whole in every individual thing simultaneously.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIV.

   How it is better understood to exist always than at every time.

   IT is also evident that this supreme Substance is without beginning and
   without end; that it has neither past, nor future, nor the temporal,
   that is, transient present in which we live; since its age, or
   eternity, which is nothing else than itself, is immutable and without
   parts. Is not, therefore, the term which seems to mean all time more
   properly understood, when applied to this Substance, to signify
   eternity, which is never unlike itself, rather than a changing
   succession of times, which is ever in some sort unlike itself?

   Hence, if this Being is said to exist always; since, for it, it is the
   same to exist and to live, no better sense can be attached to this
   statement, than that it exists or lives eternally, that is, it
   possesses interminable life, as a perfect whole at once. For its
   eternity apparently is an interminable life, existing at once as a
   perfect whole.

   For, since it has already been shown that this Substance is nothing
   else than its own life and its own eternity, is in no wise terminable,
   and does not exist, except as at once and perfectly whole, what else is
   true eternity, which is consistent with the nature of that Substance
   alone, than an interminable life, existing as at once and perfectly
   whole?

   For this truth is, at any rate, clearly perceived from the single fact
   that true eternity belongs only to that substance which alone, as we
   have proved, was not created, but is the creator, since true eternity
   is conceived to be free from the limitations of beginning and end; and
   this is proved to be consistent with the nature of no created being,
   from the very fact that all such have been created from nothing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

   It cannot suffer change by any accidents [12]

   BUT does not this Being, which has been shown to exist as in every way
   substantially identical with itself, sometimes exist as different from
   itself, at any rate accidentally? But how is it supremely immutable, if
   it can, I will not say, be, but, be conceived of, as variable by virtue
   of accidents? And, on the other hand, does it not partake of accident,
   since even this very fact that it is greater than all other natures and
   that it is unlike them seems to be an accident in its case (illi
   accidere)? But what is the inconsistency between susceptibility to
   certain facts, called accidents, and natural immutability, if from the
   undergoing of these accidents the substance undergoes no change?

   For, of all the facts, called accidents, some are understood not to be
   present or absent without some variation in the subject of the
   accident--all colors, for instance--while others are known not to
   effect any change in a thing either by occurring or not
   occurring--certain relations, for instance. For it is certain that I am
   neither older nor younger than a man who is not yet born, nor equal to
   him, nor like him. But I shall be able to sustain and to lose all these
   relations toward him, as soon as he shall have been born, according as
   he shall grow, or undergo change through divers qualities.

   It is made clear, then, that of all those facts, called accidents, a
   part bring some degree of mutability in their train, while a part do
   not impair at all the immutability of that in whose case they occur.
   Hence, although the supreme Nature in its simplicity has never
   undergone such accidents as cause mutation, yet it does not disdain
   occasional expression in terms of those accidents which are in no wise
   inconsistent with supreme immutability; and yet there is no accident
   respecting its essence, whence it would be conceived of, as itself
   variable.

   Whence this conclusion, also, may be reached, that it is susceptible of
   no accident; since, just as those accidents, which effect some change
   by their occurrence or non-occurrence, are by virtue of this very
   effect of theirs regarded as being true accidents, so those facts,
   which lack a like effect, are found to be improperly called accidents.
   Therefore, this Essence is always, in every way, substantially
   identical with itself; and it is never in any way different from
   itself, even accidentally. But, however it may be as to the proper
   signification of the term accident, this is undoubtedly true, that of
   the supremely immutable Nature no statement can be made, whence it
   shall be conceived of as mutable.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] [Accidents, as Anselm uses the term, are facts external to the
   essence of a being, which may yet be conceived to produce changes in a
   mutable being.]
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVI.

   How this Being is said to be substance: it transcends all substance and
   is individually whatever it is.

   BUT, if what we have ascertained concerning the simplicity of this
   Nature is established, how is it substance? For, though every substance
   is susceptible of admixture of difference, or, at any rate, susceptible
   of mutation by accidents, the immutable purity of this Being is
   inaccessible to admixture or mutation, in any form.

   How, then, shall it be maintained that it is a substance of any kind,
   except as it is called substance for being, and so transcends, as it is
   above, every substance? For, as great as is the difference between that
   Being, which is through itself whatever it is, and which creates every
   other being from nothing, and a being, which is made whatever it is
   through another, from nothing; so much does the supreme Substance
   differ from these beings, which are not what it is. And, since it
   alone, of all natures, derives from itself, without the help of another
   nature, whatever existence it has, is it not whatever it is
   individually and apart from association with its creatures?

   Hence, if it ever shares any name with other beings, doubtless a very
   different signification of that name is to be understood in its case.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVII.

   It is not included among substances as commonly treated, yet it is a
   substance and an indivisible spirit.

   IT is, therefore, evident that in any ordinary treatment of substance,
   this Substance cannot be included, from sharing in whose essence every
   nature is excluded. Indeed, since every substance is treated either as
   universal, i. e., as essentially common to more than one substance, as
   being a man is common to individual men; or as individual, having a
   universal essence in common with others, as individual men have in
   common with individual men the fact that they are men; does any one
   conceive that, in the treatment of other substances, that supreme
   Nature is included, which neither divides itself into more substances
   than one, nor unites with any other, by virtue of a common essence?

   Yet, seeing that it not only most certainly exists, but exists in the
   highest degree of all things; and since the essence of anything is
   usually called its substance, doubtless if any worthy name can be given
   it, there is no objection to our calling it substance.

   And since no worthier essence than spirit and body is known, and of
   these, spirit is more worthy than body, it must certainly be maintained
   that this Being is spirit and not body. But, seeing that one spirit has
   not any parts, and there cannot be more spirits than one of this kind,
   it must, by all means, be an indivisible spirit. For since, as is shown
   above, it is neither compounded of parts, nor can be conceived of as
   mutable, through any differences or accidents, it is impossible that it
   is divisible by any form of division.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVIII.

   This Spirit exists simply, and created beings are not comparable with
   him.

   IT seems to follow, then, from the preceding considerations, that the
   Spirit which exists in so wonderfully singular and so singularly
   wonderful a way of its own is in some sort unique; while other beings
   which seem to be comparable with it are not so.

   For, by diligent attention it will be seen that that Spirit alone
   exists simply, and perfectly, and absolutely; while all other beings
   are almost non-existent, and hardly exist at all. For, seeing that of
   this Spirit, because of its immutable eternity, it can in no wise be
   said, in terms of any alteration, that it was or will be, but simply
   that it is; it is not now, by mutation, anything which it either was
   not at any time, or will not be in the future. Nor does it fail to be
   now what it was, or will be, at any time; but, whatever it is, it is,
   once for all, and simultaneously, and interminably. Seeing, I say, that
   its existence is of this character, it is rightly said itself to exist
   simply, and absolutely, and perfectly.

   But since, on the other hand, all other beings, in accordance with some
   cause, have at some time been, or will be, by mutation, what they are
   not now; or, are what they were not, or will not be, at some time; and,
   since this former existence of theirs is no longer a fact; and that
   future existence is not yet a fact; and their existence in a transient,
   and most brief, and scarcely existing, present is hardly a fact--since,
   then, they exist in such mutability, it is not unreasonably denied that
   they exist simply, and perfectly, and absolutely; and it is asserted
   that they are almost nonexistent, that they scarcely exist at all.

   Again, since all beings, which are other than this Spirit himself, have
   come from non-existence to existence, not through themselves, but
   through another; and, since they return from existence to
   non-existence, so far as their own power is concerned, unless they are
   sustained through another being, is it consistent with their nature to
   exist simply, or perfectly, or absolutely, and not rather to be almost
   non-existent.

   And since the existence of this ineffable Spirit alone can in no way be
   conceived to have taken inception from non-existence, or to be capable
   of sustaining any deficiency rising from what is in nonexistence; and
   since, whatever he is himself, he is not through another than himself,
   that is, than what he is himself, ought not his existence alone to be
   conceived of as simple, and perfect, and absolute?

   But what is thus simply, and on every ground, solely perfect, simple,
   and absolute, this may very certainly be justly said to be in some sort
   unique. And, on the other hand, whatever is known to exist through a
   higher cause, and neither simply, nor perfectly, nor absolutely, but
   scarcely to exist, or to be almost non-existent--this assuredly may be
   rightly said to be in some sort non-existent.

   According to this course of reasoning, then, the creative Spirit alone
   exists, and all creatures are nonexistent; yet, they are not wholly
   non-existent, because, through that Spirit which alone exists
   absolutely, they have been made something from nothing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIX.

   His expression is identical with himself, and consubstantial with him,
   since there are not two spirits, but one.

   BUT now, having considered these questions regarding the properties of
   the supreme Nature, which have occurred to me in following the guidance
   of reason to the present point, I think it reasonable to examine this
   Spirit's expression (locutio), through which all things were created.

   For, though all that has been ascertained regarding this expression
   above has the inflexible strength of reason, I am especially compelled
   to a more careful discussion of this expression by the fact that it is
   proved to be identical with the supreme Spirit himself. For, if this
   Spirit created nothing except through himself, and whatever was created
   by him was created through that expression, how shall that expression
   be anything else than what the Spirit himself is?

   Furthermore, the facts already discovered declare irrefutably that
   nothing at all ever could, or can, exist, except the creative Spirit
   and its creatures. But it is impossible that the expression of this
   Spirit is included among created beings; for every created being was
   created through that expression; but that expression could not be
   created through itself. For nothing can be created through itself,
   since every creature exists later than that through which it is
   created, and nothing exists later than itself.

   The alternative remaining is, then, that this expression of the supreme
   Spirit, since it cannot be a creature, is no other than the supreme
   Spirit. Therefore, this expression itself can be conceived of as
   nothing else than the intelligence (intelligentia) of this Spirit, by
   which he conceives of (intelligit) all things. For, to him, what is
   expressing anything, according to this kind of expression, but
   conceiving of it? For he does not, like man, ever fail to express what
   he conceives.

   If, then, the supremely simple Nature is nothing else than what its
   intelligence is, just as it is identical with its wisdom, necessarily,
   in the same way, it is nothing else than what its expression is. But,
   since it is already manifest that the supreme Spirit is one only, and
   altogether indivisible, this his expression must be so consubstantial
   with him, that they are not two spirits, but one.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXX.

   This expression does not consist of more words than one, but is one
   Word.

   WHY, then, should I have any further doubt regarding that question
   which I dismissed above as doubtful, namely, whether this expression
   consists of more words than one, or of one? For, if it is so
   consubstantial with the supreme Nature that they are not two spirits,
   but one; assuredly, just as the latter is supremely simple, so is the
   former. It therefore does not consist of more words than one, but is
   one Word, through which all things were created.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXI.

   This Word itself is not the likeness of created beings, but the reality
   of their being, while created beings are a kind of likeness of
   reality.--What natures are greater and more excellent than others.

   BUT here, it seems to me, there arises a question that is not easy to
   answer, and yet must not be left in any ambiguity. For all words of
   that sort by which we express any objects in our mind, that is,
   conceive of them, are likenesses and images of the objects to which
   they correspond; and every likeness or image is more or less true,
   according as it more or less closely imitates the object of which it is
   the likeness.

   What, then, is to be our position regarding the Word by which all
   things are expressed, and through which all were created? Will it be,
   or will it not be, the likeness of the things that have been created
   through itself? For, if it is itself the true likeness of mutable
   things, it is not consubstantial with supreme immutability; which is
   false. But, if it is not altogether true, and is merely a sort of
   likeness of mutable things, then the Word of supreme Truth is not
   altogether true; which is absurd. But if it has no likeness to mutable
   things, how were they created after its example?

   But perhaps nothing of this ambiguity will remain if--as the reality of
   a man is said to be the living man, but the likeness or image of a man
   in his picture--so the reality of being is conceived of as in the Word,
   whose essence exists so supremely that in a certain sense it alone
   exists; while in these things which, in comparison with that Essence,
   are in some sort non-existent, and, yet were made something through,
   and according to, that Word, a kind of imitation of that supreme
   Essence is found.

   For, in this way the Word of supreme Truth, which is also itself
   supreme Truth, will experience neither gain nor loss, according as it
   is more or less like its creatures. But the necessary inference will
   rather be, that every created being exists in so much the greater
   degree, or is so much the more excellent, the more like it is to what
   exists supremely, and is supremely great.

   For on this account, perhaps,--nay, not perhaps, but certainly,--does
   every mind judge natures in any way alive to excel those that are not
   alive, the sentient to excel the non-sentient, the rational the
   irrational. For, since the supreme Nature, after a certain unique
   manner of its own, not only exists, but lives, and is sentient and
   rational, it is clear that, of all existing beings, that which is in
   some way alive is more like this supreme Nature, than that which is not
   alive at all; and what, in any way, even by a corporeal sense, cognises
   anything, is more like this Nature than what is not sentient at all;
   and what is rational, more than what is incapable of reasoning.

   But it is clear, for a like reason, that certain natures exist in a
   greater or less degree than others. For, just as that is more excellent
   by nature which, through its natural essence, is nearer to the most
   excellent Being, so certainly that nature exists in a greater degree,
   whose essence is more like the supreme Essence. And I think that this
   can easily be ascertained as follows. If we should conceive any
   substance that is alive, and sentient, and rational, to be deprived of
   its reason, then of its sentience, then of its life, and finally of the
   bare existence that remains, who would fail to understand that the
   substance that is thus destroyed, little by little, is gradually
   brought to smaller and smaller degrees of existence, and at last to
   non-existence? But the attributes which, taken each by itself, reduce
   an essence to less and less degrees of existence, if assumed in order,
   lead it to greater and greater degrees.

   It is evident, then, that a living substance exists in a greater degree
   than one that is not living, a sentient than a non-sentient, and a
   rational than a nonrational. So, there is no doubt that every substance
   exists in a greater degree, and is more excellent, according as it is
   more like that substance which exists supremely and is supremely
   excellent.

   It is sufficiently clear, then, that in the Word, through which all
   things were created, is not their likeness, but their true and simple
   essence; while, in the things created, there is not a simple and
   absolute essence, but an imperfect imitation of that true Essence.
   Hence, it necessarily follows, that this Word is not more nor less
   true, according to its likeness to the things created, but every
   created nature has a higher essence and dignity, the more it is seen to
   approach that Word.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXII.

   The supreme Spirit expresses himself by a coeternal Word.

   BUT since this is true, how can what is simple Truth be the Word
   corresponding to those objects, of which it is not the likeness? Since
   every word by which an object is thus mentally expressed is the
   likeness of that object, if this is not the word corresponding to the
   objects that have been created through it, how shall we be sure that it
   is the Word? For every word is a word corresponding to some object.
   Therefore, if there were no creature, there would be no word.

   Are we to conclude, then, that if there were no creature, that Word
   would not exist at all, which is the supreme self-sufficient Essence?
   Or, would the supreme Being itself, perhaps, which is the Word still be
   the eternal Being, but not the Word, if nothing were ever created
   through that Being? For, to what has not been, and is not, and will not
   be, then can be no word corresponding.

   But, according to this reasoning, if there were never any being but the
   supreme Spirit, there would be no word at all in him. If there were no
   word in him, he would express nothing to himself; if he expressed
   nothing to himself, since, for him, expressing anything is the same
   with understanding or conceiving of it (intelligere), he would not
   understand or conceive of anything; if he understood or conceived of
   nothing, then the supreme Wisdom, which is nothing else than this
   Spirit, would understand or conceive of nothing; which is most absurd.

   What is to be inferred? For, if it conceived of nothing, how would it
   be the supreme Wisdom? Or, if there were in no wise anything but it, of
   what would it conceive? Would it not conceive of itself? But how can it
   be even imagined that the supreme Wisdom, at any time does not conceive
   of itself; since a rational mind can remember not only itself, but that
   supreme Wisdom, and conceive of that Wisdom and of itself? For, if the
   human mind could have no memory or concept of that Wisdom or of itself,
   it would not distinguish itself at all from irrational creatures, and
   that Wisdom from the whole created world, in silent meditation by
   itself, as my mind does now.

   Hence, that Spirit, supreme as he is eternal, is thus eternally mindful
   of himself, and conceives of himself after the likeness of a rational
   mind; nay, not after the likeness of anything; but in the first place
   that Spirit, and the rational mind after its likeness. But, if he
   conceives of himself eternally, he expresses himself eternally. If he
   expresses himself eternally, his Word is eternally with him. Whether,
   therefore, it be thought of in connection with no other existing being,
   or with other existing beings, the Word of that Spirit must be
   coeternal with him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXIII.

   He utters himself and what he creates by a single consubstantial Word.

   BUT here, in my inquiry concerning the Word, by which the Creator
   expresses all that he creates, is suggested the word by which he, who
   creates all, expresses himself. Does he express himself, then, by one
   word, and what he creates by another; or does he rather express
   whatever he creates by the same word whereby he expresses himself?

   For this Word also, by which he expresses himself, must be identical
   with himself, as is evidently true of the Word by which he expresses
   his creatures. For since, even if nothing but that supreme Spirit ever
   existed, urgent reason would still require the existence of that word
   by which he expresses himself, what is more true than that his Word is
   nothing else than what he himself is? Therefore, if he expresses
   himself and what he creates, by a Word consubstantial with himself, it
   is manifest that of the Word by which he expresses himself, and of the
   Word by which he expresses the created world, the substance is one.

   How, then, if the substance is one, are there two words? But, perhaps,
   identity of substance does not compel us to admit a single Word. For
   the Creator himself, who speaks in these words, has the same substance
   with them, and yet is not the Word. But, undoubtedly the word by which
   the supreme Wisdom expresses itself may most fitly be called its Word
   on the former ground, namely, that it contains the perfect likeness of
   that Wisdom.

   For, on no ground can it be denied that when a rational mind conceives
   of itself in meditation the image of itself arises in its thought, or
   rather the thought of the mind is itself its image, after its likeness,
   as if formed from its impression. For, whatever object the mind, either
   through representation of the body or through reason, desires to
   conceive of truly, it at least attempts to express its likeness, so far
   as it is able, in the mental concept itself. And the more truly it
   succeeds in this, the more truly does it think of the object itself;
   and, indeed, this fact is observed more clearly when it thinks of
   something else which it is not, and especially when it thinks of a
   material body. For, when I think of a man I know, in his absence, the
   vision of my thought forms such an image as I have acquired in memory
   through my ocular vision and this image is the word corresponding to
   the man I express by thinking of him.

   The rational mind, then, when it conceives of itself in thought, has
   with itself its image born of itself that is, its thought in its
   likeness, as if formed from its impression, although it cannot, except
   in thought alone, separate itself from its image, which image is its
   word.

   Who, then, can deny that the supreme Wisdom, when it conceives of
   itself by expressing itself, begets a likeness of itself consubstantial
   with it, namely, its Word? And this Word, although of a subject so
   uniquely important nothing can be said with sufficient propriety, may
   still not inappropriately be called the image of that Wisdom, its
   representation, just as it is called his likeness.

   But the Word by which the Creator expresses the created world is not at
   all, in the same way, a word corresponding to the created world, since
   it is not this world's likeness, but its elementary essence. It
   therefore follows, that he does not express the created world itself by
   a word corresponding to the created world. To what, then, does the word
   belong, whereby he expresses it, if he does not express it by a word,
   belonging to itself? For what he expresses, he expresses by a word, and
   a word must belong to something, that is, it is the likeness of
   something. But if he expresses nothing but himself or his created world
   he can express nothing, except by a word corresponding to himself or to
   something else.

   So, if he expresses nothing by a word belonging to the created world,
   whatever he expresses, he expresses by the Word corresponding to
   himself. By one and the same Word, then, he expresses himself and
   whatever he has made.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXIV.

   How he can express the created world by his Word.

   BUT how can objects so different as the creative and the created being
   be expressed by one Word, especially since that Word itself is
   coeternal with him who expresses them, while the created world is not
   coeternal with him? Perhaps, because he himself is supreme Wisdom and
   supreme Reason, in which are all things that have been created; just as
   a work which is made after one of the arts, not only when it is made,
   but before it is made, and after it is destroyed, is always in respect
   of the art itself nothing else than what that art is.

   Hence, when the supreme Spirit expresses himself, he expresses all
   created beings. For, both before they were created, and now that they
   have been created, and after they are decayed or changed in any way,
   they are ever in him not what they are in themselves, but what this
   Spirit himself is. For, in themselves they are mutable beings, created
   according to immutable reason; while in him is the true first being,
   and the first reality of existence, the more like unto which those
   beings are in any way, the more really and excellently do they exist.
   Thus, it may reasonably be declared that, when the supreme Spirit
   expresses himself, he also expresses whatever has been created by one
   and the same Word.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXV.

   Whatever has been created is in his Word and knowledge, life and truth.

   BUT, since it is established that his word is consubstantial with him,
   and perfectly like him, it necessarily follows that all things that
   exist in him exist also, and in the same way, in his Word. Whatever has
   been created, then, whether alive or not alive, or howsoever it exists
   in itself, is very life and truth in him.

   But, since knowing is the same to the supreme Spirit as conceiving or
   expressing, he must know all things that he knows in the same way in
   which he expresses or conceives of them. Therefore, just as all things
   are in his Word life and truth, so are they in his knowledge.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXVI.

   In how incomprehensible a way he expresses or knows the objects created
   by him.

   HENCE, it may be most clearly comprehended that how this Spirit
   expresses, or how he knows the created world, cannot be comprehended by
   human knowledge. For none can doubt that created substances exist far
   differently in themselves than in our knowledge. For, in themselves
   they exist by virtue of their own being; while in our knowledge is not
   their being, but their likeness.

   We conclude, then, that they exist more truly in themselves than in our
   knowledge, in the same degree in which they exist more truly anywhere
   by virtue of their own being, than by virtue of their likeness.
   Therefore, since this is also an established truth, that every created
   substance exists more truly in the Word, that is, in the intelligence
   of the Creator, than it does in itself, in the same degree in which the
   creative being exists more truly than the created; how can the human
   mind comprehend of what kind is that expression and that knowledge,
   which is so much higher and truer than created substances; if our
   knowledge is as far surpassed by those substances as their likeness is
   removed from their being?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXVII.

   Whatever his relation to his creatures, this relation his Word also
   sustains: yet both do not simultaneously sustain this relation as more
   than one being.

   BUT since it has already been clearly demonstrated that the supreme
   Spirit created all things through his Word, did not the Word itself
   also create all things? For, since it is consubstantial with him, it
   must be the supreme essence of that of which it is the Word. But there
   is no supreme Essence, except one, which is the only creator and the
   only beginning of all things which have been created. For this Essence,
   through no other than itself, alone created all things from nothing.
   Hence, whatever the supreme Spirit creates, the same his Word also
   creates, and in the same way.

   Whatever relation, then, the supreme Spirit bears to what he creates,
   this relation his Word also bears, and in the same way. And yet, both
   do not bear it simultaneously, as more than one, since there are not
   more supreme creative essences than one. Therefore, just as he is the
   creator and the beginning of the world, so is his Word also; and yet
   there are not two, but one creator and one beginning.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXVIII.

   It cannot be explained why they are two, although they must be so.

   OUR careful attention is therefore demanded by a peculiarity which,
   though most unusual in other beings, seems to belong to the supreme
   Spirit and his Word. For, it is certain that in each of these
   separately and in both simultaneously, whatever they are so exists that
   it is separately perfected in both, and yet does not admit plurality in
   the two. For although, taken separately, he is perfectly supreme Truth
   and Creator, and his Word is supreme Truth and Creator; yet both at
   once are not two truths or two creators.

   But although this is true, yet it is most remarkably clear that neither
   he, whose is the Word, can be his own Word, nor can the Word be he,
   whose Word it is, although in so far as regards either what they are
   substantially, or what relation they bear to the created world, they
   ever preserve an indivisible unity. But in respect of the fact that he
   does not derive existence from that Word, but that Word from him, they
   admit an ineffable plurality, ineffable, certainly, for although
   necessity requires that they be two, it can in no wise be explained why
   they are two.

   For although they may perhaps be called two equals, or some other
   mutual relation may in like manner be attributed to them, yet if it
   were to be asked what it is in these very relative expressions with
   reference to which they are used, it cannot be expressed plurally, as
   one speaks of two equal lines, or two like men. For, neither are there
   two equal spirits nor two equal creators, nor is there any dual
   expression which indicates either their essence or their relation to
   the created world; and there is no dual expression which designates the
   peculiar relation of the one to the other, since there are neither two
   words nor two images.

   For the Word, by virtue of the fact that it is a word or image, bears a
   relation to the other, because it is Word and image only as it is the
   Word and image of something; and so peculiar are these attributes to
   the one that they are by no means predicable of the other. For he,
   whose is the Word and image, is neither image nor Word. It is,
   therefore, evident that it cannot be explained why they are two, the
   supreme Spirit and the Word, although by certain properties of each
   they are required to be two. For it is the property of the one to
   derive existence from the other, and the property of that other that
   the first derives existence from him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXIX.

   This Word derives existence from the supreme Spirit by birth.

   AND this truth, it seems, can be expressed in no more familiar terms
   than when it is said to be the property of the one, to be born of the
   other; and of the other, that the first is born of him. For it is now
   clearly proved, that the Word of the supreme Spirit does not derive
   existence from him, as do those beings which have been created by him;
   but as Creator from Creator, supreme Being from supreme Being. And, to
   dispose of this comparison with all brevity, it is one and the same
   being which derives existence from one and the same being, and on such
   terms, that it in no wise derives existence, except from that being.

   Since it is evident, then, that the Word of the supreme Spirit so
   derives existence from him alone, that it is completely analogous to
   the offspring of a parent; and that it does not derive existence from
   him, as if it were created by him, doubtless no more fitting
   supposition can be entertained regarding its origin, than that it
   derives existence from the supreme Spirit by birth (nascendo).

   For, innumerable objects are unhesitatingly said to be born of those
   things from which they derive existence, although they possess no such
   likeness to those things of which they are said to be born, as
   offspring to a parent.--We say, for instance, that the hair is born of
   the head, or the fruit of the tree, although the hair does not resemble
   the head, nor the fruit the tree.

   If, then, many objects of this sort are without absurdity said to be
   born, so much the more fittingly may the Word of the supreme Spirit be
   said to derive existence from him by birth, the more perfect the
   resemblance it bears to him, like a child's to its parent, through
   deriving existence from him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XL.

   He is most truly a parent, and that Word his offspring.

   BUT if it is most properly said to be born, and is so like him of whom
   it is born, why should it be esteemed like, as a child is like his
   parent? why should it not rather be declared, that the Spirit is more
   truly a parent, and the Word his offspring, the more he alone is
   sufficient to effect this birth, and the more what is born expresses
   his likeness? For, among other beings which we know bear the relations
   of parent and child, none so begets as to be solely and without
   accessory, sufficient to the generation of offspring; and none is so
   begotten that without any admixture of unlikeness, it shows complete
   likeness to its parent.

   If, then, the Word of the supreme Spirit so derives its complete
   existence from the being of that Spirit himself alone, and is so
   uniquely like him, that no child ever so completely derives existence
   from its parent, and none is so like its parent, certainly the relation
   of parent and offspring can be ascribed to no beings so consistently as
   to the supreme Spirit and his Word. Hence, it is his property to be
   most truly parent, and its to be most truly his offspring.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLI.

   He most truly begets, and it is most truly begotten.

   BUT it will be impossible to establish this proposition, unless, in
   equal degree, he most truly begets, and it is most truly begotten. As
   the former supposition is evidently true, so the latter is necessarily
   most certain. Hence, it belongs to the supreme Spirit most truly to
   beget, and to his Word to be most truly begotten.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLII.

   It is the property of the one to be most truly progenitor and Father,
   and of the other to be the begotten and Son.

   I should certainly be glad, and perhaps able, now to reach the
   conclusion, that he is most truly the Father , while this Word is most
   truly his Son. But I think that even this question should not be
   neglected: whether it is more fitting to call them Father and Son, than
   mother and daughter, since in them there is no distinction of sex.

   For, if it is consistent with the nature of the one to be the Father,
   and of his offspring to be the Son, because both are Spirit (Spiritus,
   masculine); why is it not, with equal reason, consistent with the
   nature of the one to be the mother, and the other the daughter, since
   both are truth and wisdom (veritas et sapientia, feminine)?

   Or, is it because in these natures that have a difference of sex, it
   belongs to the superior sex to be father or son, and to the inferior to
   be mother or daughter? And this is certainly a natural fact in most
   instances, but in some the contrary is true, as among certain kinds of
   birds, among which the female is always larger and stronger, while the
   male is smaller and weaker.

   At any rate, it is more consistent to call the supreme Spirit father
   than mother, for this reason, that the first and principal cause of
   offspring is always in the father. For, if the maternal cause is ever
   in some way preceded by the paternal, it is exceedingly inconsistent
   that the name mother should be attached to that parent with which, for
   the generation of offspring, no other cause is associated, and which no
   other precedes. It is, therefore, most true that the supreme Spirit is
   Father of his offspring. But, if the son is always more like the father
   than is the daughter, while nothing is more like the supreme Father
   than his offspring; then it is most true that this offspring is not a
   daughter, but a Son.

   Hence, just as it is the property of the one most truly to beget, and
   of the other to be begotten, so it is the property of the one to be
   most truly progenitor, and of the other to be most truly begotten. And
   as the one is most truly the parent, and the other his offspring, so
   the one is most truly Father, and the other most truly Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLIII.

   Consideration of the common attributes of both and the individual
   properties of each.

   NOW that so many and so important properties of each have been
   discovered, whereby a strange plurality, as ineffable as it is
   inevitable, is proved to exist in the supreme unity, I think it most
   interesting to reflect, again and again, upon so unfathomable a
   mystery.

   For observe: although it is so impossible that he who begets, and he
   who is begotten, are the same, and that parent and offspring are the
   same--so impossible that necessarily one must be the progenitor and the
   other the begotten, and one the Father, the other the Son; yet, here it
   is so necessary that he who begets and he who is begotten shall be the
   same, and also that parent and offspring shall be the same, that the
   progenitor cannot be any other than what the begotten is, nor the
   Father any other than the Son.

   And although the one is one, and the other another, so that it is
   altogether evident that they are two; yet that which the one and the
   other are is in such a way one and the same, that it is a most obscure
   mystery why they are two. For, in such a way is one the Father and the
   other the Son, that when I speak of both I perceive that I have spoken
   of two; and yet so identical is that which both Father and Son are,
   that I do not understand why they are two of whom I have spoken.

   For, although the Father separately is the perfectly supreme Spirit,
   and the Son separately is the perfectly supreme Spirit, yet, so are the
   Spirit-Father and the Spirit-Son one and the same being, that the
   Father and the Son are not two spirits, but one Spirit. For, just as to
   separate properties of separate beings, plurality is not attributed,
   since they are not properties of two things, so, what is common to both
   preserves an indivisible unity, although it belongs, as a whole, to
   them taken separately.

   For, as there are not two fathers or two sons, but one Father and one
   Son, since separate properties belong to separate beings, so there are
   not two spirits, but one Spirit; although it belongs both to the
   Father, taken separately, and to the Son, taken separately, to be the
   perfect Spirit. For so opposite are their relations, that the one never
   assumes the property of the other; so harmonious are they in nature,
   that the one ever contains the essence of the other. For they are so
   diverse by virtue of the fact that the one is the Father and the other
   the Son, that the Father is never called the Son, nor the Son the
   Father; and they are so identical, by virtue of their substance, that
   the essence of the Son is ever in the Father, and the essence of the
   Father in the Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLIV.

   How one is the essence of the other.

   HENCE, even if one is called the essence of the other, there is no
   departure from truth; but the supreme simplicity and unity of their
   common nature is thus honored. For, not as one conceives of a man's
   wisdom, through which man is wise, though he cannot be wise through
   himself, can we thus understand the statement that the Father is
   essence of the Son, and the Son the essence of the Father. We cannot
   understand that the Son is existent through the Father, and the Father
   through the Son, as if the one could not be existent except through the
   other, just as a man cannot be wise except through wisdom.

   For, as the supreme Wisdom is ever wise through itself, so the supreme
   Essence ever exists through itself. But, the perfectly supreme Essence
   is the Father, and the perfectly supreme Essence is the Son. Hence, the
   perfect Father and the perfect Son exist, each through himself, just as
   each is wise through himself.

   For the Son is not the less perfect essence or wisdom because he is an
   essence born of the essence of the Father, and a wisdom born of the
   wisdom of the Father; but he would be a less perfect essence or wisdom
   if he did not exist through himself, and were not wise through himself.

   For, there is no inconsistency between the subsistence of the Son
   through himself, and his deriving existence from his Father. For, as
   the Father has essence, and wisdom, and life in himself; so that not
   through another's, but through his own, essence he exists; through his
   own wisdom he is wise; through his own life he lives; so, by
   generation, he grants to his Son the possession of essence, and wisdom,
   and life in himself, so that not through an extraneous essence, wisdom,
   and life, but through his own, he subsists, is wise, and lives;
   otherwise, the existence of Father and Son will not be the same, nor
   will the Son be equal to the Father. But it has already been clearly
   proved how false this supposition is.

   Hence, there is no inconsistency between the subsistence of the Son
   through himself, and his deriving existence from the Father, since he
   must have from the Father this very power of subsisting through
   himself. For, if a wise man should teach me his wisdom, which I
   formerly lacked, he might without impropriety be said to teach me by
   this very wisdom of his. But, although my wisdom would derive its
   existence and the fact of its being from his wisdom, yet when my wisdom
   once existed, it would be no other essence than its own, nor would it
   be wise except through itself.

   Much more, then, the eternal Father's eternal Son, who so derives
   existence from the Father that they are not two essences, subsists, is
   wise, and lives through himself. Hence, it is inconceivable that the
   Father should be the essence of the Son, or the Son the essence of the
   Father, on the ground that the one could not subsist through itself,
   but must subsist through the other. But in order to indicate how they
   share in an essence supremely simple and supremely one, it may
   consistently be said, and conceived, that the one is so identical with
   the other that the one possesses the essence of the other.

   On these grounds, then, since there is obviously no difference between
   possessing an essence and being an essence, just as the one possesses
   the essence of the other, so the one is the essence of the other, that
   is, the one has the same existence with the other.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLV.

   The Son may more appropriately be called the essence of the Father,
   than the Father the essence of the Son: and in like manner the Son is
   the virtue, wisdom, etc., of the Father.

   AND although, for reasons we have noted, this is true, it is much more
   proper to call the Son the essence of the Father than the Father the
   essence of the Son. For, since the Father has his being from none other
   than himself, it is not wholly appropriate to say that he has the being
   of another than himself; while, since the Son has his being from the
   Father, and has the same essence with his Father, he may most
   appropriately be said to have the essence of his Father.

   Hence, seeing that neither has an essence, except by being an essence;
   as the Son is more appropriately conceived to have the essence of the
   Father than the Father to have the essence of the Son, so the Son may
   more fitly be called the essence of the Father than the Father the
   essence of the son. For this single explanation proves, with
   sufficiently emphatic brevity, that the Son not only has the same
   essence with the Father, but has this very essence from the Father; so
   that, to assert that the Son is the essence of the Father is the same
   as to assert that the Son is not a different essence from the essence
   of the Father nay, from the Father essence.

   In like manner, therefore, the Son is the virtue of the Father, and his
   wisdom, and justice, and whatever is consistently attributed to the
   essence of the supreme Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLVI.

   How some of these truths which are thus expounded may also be conceived
   of in another way.

   YET, some of these truths, which may be thus expounded and conceived
   of, are apparently capable of another interpretation as well, not
   inconsistent with this same assertion. For it is proved that the Son is
   the true Word, that is, the perfect intelligence, conceiving of the
   whole substance of the Father, or perfect cognition of that substance,
   and knowledge of it, and wisdom regarding it; that is, it understands,
   and conceives of, the very essence of the Father, and cognises it, and
   knows it, and is wise (sapit) regarding it.

   If, then, in this sense, the Son is called the intelligence of the
   Father, and wisdom concerning him, and knowledge and cognition of him,
   and acquaintance with him; since the Son understands and conceives of
   the Father, is wise concerning him, knows and is acquainted with him,
   there is no departure from truth.

   Most properly, too, may the Son be called the truth of the Father, not
   only in the sense that the truth of the Son is the same with that of
   the Father, as we have already seen; but in this sense, also, that in
   him no imperfect imitation shall be conceived of, but the complete
   truth of the substance of the Father since he is no other than what the
   Father is.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLVII.

   The Son is the intelligence of intelligence and the Truth of truth

   BUT if the very substance of the Father is intelligence, and knowledge,
   and wisdom, and truth, it is consequently inferred that as the Son is
   the intelligence, and knowledge, and wisdom, and truth, of the paternal
   substance, so he is the intelligence of intelligence, the knowledge of
   knowledge, the wisdom of wisdom, and the truth of truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLVIII.

   How the Son is the intelligence or wisdom of memory or the memory of
   the Father and of memory.

   BUT what is to be our notion of memory? Is the Son to be regarded as
   the intelligence conceiving of memory, or as the memory of the Father,
   or as the memory of memory? Indeed, since it cannot be denied that the
   supreme Wisdom remembers itself, nothing can be more consistent than to
   regard the Father as memory, just as the Son is the Word; because the
   Word is apparently born of memory, a fact that is more clearly seen in
   the case of the human mind.

   For, since the human mind is not always thinking of itself, though it
   ever remembers itself, it is clear that, when it thinks of itself, the
   word corresponding to it is born of memory. Hence, it appears that, if
   it always thought of itself, its word would be always born of memory.
   For, to think of an object of which we have remembrance, this is to
   express it mentally; while the word corresponding to the object is the
   thought itself, formed after the likeness of that object from memory.

   Hence, it may be clearly apprehended in the supreme Wisdom, which
   always thinks of itself, just as it remembers itself, that, of the
   eternal remembrance of it, its coeternal Word is born. Therefore, as
   the Word is properly conceived of as the child, the memory most
   appropriately takes the name of parent. If, then, the child which is
   born of the supreme Spirit alone is the child of his memory, there can
   be no more logical conclusion than that his memory is himself. For not
   in respect of the fact that he remembers himself does he exist in his
   own memory, like ideas that exist in the human memory, without being
   the memory itself; but he so remembers himself that he is his own
   memory.

   It therefore follows that, just as the Son is the intelligence or
   wisdom of the Father, so he is that of the memory of the Father. But,
   regarding whatever the Son has wisdom or understanding, this he
   likewise remembers. The Son is, therefore, the memory of the Father,
   and the memory of memory, that is, the memory that remembers the
   Father, who is memory, just as he is the wisdom of the Father, and the
   wisdom of wisdom, that is, the wisdom wise regarding the wisdom of the
   Father; and the Son is indeed memory, born of memory, as he is wisdom,
   born of wisdom, while the Father is memory and wisdom born of none.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLIX.

   The supreme Spirit loves himself.

   BUT, while I am here considering with interest the individual
   properties and the common attributes of Father and Son, I find none in
   them more pleasurable to contemplate than the feeling of mutual love.
   For how absurd it would be to deny that the supreme Spirit loves
   himself, just as he remembers himself, and conceives of himself! since
   even the rational human mind is convinced that it can love both itself
   and him, because it can remember itself and him, and can conceive of
   itself and of him; for idle and almost useless is the memory and
   conception of any object, unless, so far as reason requires, the object
   itself is loved or condemned. The supreme Spirit, then, loves himself,
   just as he remembers himself and conceives of himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER L.

   The same love proceeds equally from Father and Son.

   IT is, at any rate, clear to the rational man that he does not remember
   himself or conceive of himself because he loves himself, but he loves
   himself because he remembers himself and conceives of himself; and that
   he could not love himself if he did not remember and conceive of
   himself. For no object is loved without remembrance or conception of
   it; while many things are retained in memory and conceived of that are
   not loved.

   It is evident, then, that the love of the supreme Spirit proceeds from
   the fact that he remember himself and conceives of himself (se
   intelligit). But if, by the memory of the supreme Spirit, we understand
   the Father, and by his intelligence by which he conceives of anything,
   the Son, it is manifest that the love of the supreme Spirit proceeds
   equally from Father and Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LI.

   Each loves himself and the other with equal love.

   BUT if the supreme Spirit loves himself, no doubt the Father loves
   himself, the Son loves himself, and the one the other; since the Father
   separately is the supreme Spirit, and the Son separately is the supreme
   Spirit, and both at once one Spirit. And, since each equally remembers
   himself and the other, and conceives equally of himself and the other;
   and since what is loved, or loves in the Father, or in the Son, is
   altogether the same, necessarily each loves himself and the other with
   an equal love.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LII.

   This love is as great as the supreme Spirit himself.

   HOW great, then, is this love of the supreme Spirit, common as it is to
   Father and Son! But, if he loves himself as much as he remembers and
   conceives of himself; and, moreover, remembers and conceives of himself
   in as great a degree as that in which his essence exists, since
   otherwise it cannot exist; undoubtedly his love is as great as he
   himself is.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LIII.

   This love is identical with the supreme Spirit, and yet it is itself
   with the Father and the Son one spirit.

   BUT, what can be equal to the supreme Spirit, except the supreme
   Spirit? That love is, then, the supreme Spirit. Hence, if no creature,
   that is, if nothing other than the supreme Spirit, the Father and the
   Son, ever existed; nevertheless, Father and Son would love themselves
   and one another.

   It therefore follows that this love is nothing else than what the
   Father and the Son are, which is the supreme Being. But, since there
   cannot be more than one supreme Being, what inference can be more
   necessary than that Father and Son and the love of both are one supreme
   Being? Therefore, this love is supreme Wisdom, supreme Truth, the
   supreme Good, and whatsoever can be attributed to the substance the
   supreme Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LIV.

   It proceeds as a whole from the Father, and as a whole from the Son,
   and yet does not exist except as one love.

   IT should be carefully considered whether there are two loves, one
   proceeding from the Father, the other from the Son; or one, not
   proceeding as a whole from one, but in part from the Father, in part
   from the Son; or neither more than one, nor one proceeding in part from
   each separately, but one proceeding as a whole from each separately,
   and likewise as a whole from the two at once.

   But the solution of such a question can, without doubt, be apprehended
   from the fact that this love proceeds not from that in which Father and
   Son are more than one, but from that in which they are one. For, not
   from their relations, which are more than one, but from their essence
   itself, which does not admit of plurality, do Father and Son equally
   produce so great a good.

   Therefore, as the Father separately is the supreme Spirit, and the Son
   separately is the supreme Spirit, and Father and Son at once are not
   two, but one Spirit; so from the Father separately the love of the
   supreme Spirit emanates as a whole, and from the Son as a whole, and at
   once from Father and Son, not as two, but as one and the same whole.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LV.

   This love is not their Son.

   SINCE this love, then, has its being equally from Father and Son, and
   is so like both that it is in no wise unlike them, but is altogether
   identical with them; is it to be regarded as their Son or offspring?
   But, as the Word, so soon as it is examined, declares itself to be the
   offspring of him from whom it derives existence, by displaying a
   manifold likeness to its parent; so love plainly denies that it
   sustains such a relation, since, so long as it is conceived to proceed
   from Father and Son, it does not at once show to one who contemplates
   it so evident a likeness to him from whom it derives existence,
   although deliberate reasoning teaches us that it is altogether
   identical with Father and Son.

   Therefore, if it is their offspring, either one of them is its father
   and the other its mother, or each is its father, or
   mother,--suppositions which apparently contradict all truth. For, since
   it proceeds in precisely the same way from the Father as from the Son,
   regard for truth does not allow the relations of Father and Son to it
   to be described by different words; therefore, the one is not its
   father, the other its mother. But that there are two beings which,
   taken separately, bear each the perfect relation of father or mother,
   differing in no respect, to some one being--of this no existing nature
   allows proof by any example.

   Hence, both, that is, Father and Son, are not father and mother of the
   love emanating from them. It therefore is apparently most inconsistent
   with truth that their identical love should be their son or offspring.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LVI.

   Only the Father begets and is unbegotten; only the son is begotten;
   only love neither begotten nor unbegotten.

   STILL, it is apparent that this love can neither be said, in accordance
   with the usage of common speech, to be unbegotten, nor can it so
   properly be said to be begotten, as the Word is said to be begotten.
   For we often say of a thing that it is begotten of that from which it
   derives existence, as when we say that light or heat is begotten of
   fire, or any effect of its cause.

   On this ground, then, love, proceeding from the supreme Spirit, cannot
   be declared to be wholly unbegotten, but it cannot so properly be said
   to be begotten as can the Word; since the Word is the most true
   offspring and most true Son, while it is manifest that love is by no
   means offspring or son.

   He alone, therefore, may, or rather should, be called begetter and
   unbegotten, whose is the Word; since he alone is Father and parent, and
   in no wise derives existence from another; and the Word alone should be
   called begotten, which alone is Son and offspring. But only the love of
   both is neither begotten nor unbegotten, because it is neither son nor
   offspring, and yet does in some sort derive existence from another.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LVII.

   This love is uncreated and creator, as are Father and Son; and yet it
   is with them not three, but one uncreated and creative being. And it
   may be called the Spirit of Father and Son.

   BUT, since this love separately is the supreme Being, as are Father and
   Son, and yet at once Father and Son, and the love of both are not more
   than one, but one supreme Being, which alone was created by none, and
   created all things through no other than itseIf; since this is true,
   necessarily, as the Father separately, and the Son separately, are each
   uncreated and creator, so, too, love separately is uncreated and
   creator, and yet all three at once are not more than one, but one
   uncreated and creative being.

   None, therefore, makes or begets or creates the Father, but the Father
   alone begets, but does not create, the Son; while Father and Son alike
   do not create or beget, but somehow, if such an expression may be used,
   breathe their love: for, although the supremely immutable Being does
   not breathe after our fashion, yet the truth that this Being sends
   forth this, its love, which proceeds from it, not by departing from it,
   but by deriving existence from it, can perhaps be no better expressed
   than by saying that this Being breathes its love.

   But, if this expression is admissible, as the Word of the supreme Being
   is its Son, so its love may fittingly enough be called its breath
   (Spiritus). So that, though it is itself essentially spirit, as are
   Father and Son, they are not regarded as the spirits of anything, since
   neither is the Father born of any other nor the Son of the Father, as
   it were, by breathing; while that love is regarded as the Breath or
   Spirit of both since from both breathing in their transcendent way it
   mysteriously proceeds.

   And this love, too, it seems, from the fact there is community of being
   between Father and Son, may, not unreasonably, take, as it were its
   own, some name which is common to Father and Son; if there is any
   exigency demanding that it should have a name proper to itself. And,
   indeed, if this love is actually designated by the name Spirit, as by
   its own name, since this name equally describes the Father and the Son:
   it will be useful to this effect also, that through this name it shall
   be signified that this love is identical with Father and Son, although
   it has its being from them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LVIII.

   As the Son is the essence or wisdom of the Father in the sense that he
   has the same essence or wisdom that the Father has: so likewise the
   Spirit is the essence and wisdom etc. of Father and Son.

   ALSO, just as the Son is the substance and wisdom and virtue of the
   Father, in the sense that he has the same essence and wisdom and virtue
   with the Father; so it may be conceived that the Spirit of both is the
   essence or wisdom or virtue of Father and Son, since it has altogether
   the same essence, wisdom, and virtue with these.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LIX.

   The Father and the Son and their Spirit exist equally the one in the
   other.

   IT is a most interesting consideration that the Father, and the Son,
   and the Spirit of both, exist in one another with such equality that no
   one of them surpasses another. For, not only is each in such a way the
   perfectly supreme Being that, nevertheless, all three at once exist
   only as one supreme Being, but the same truth is no less capable of
   proof when each is taken separately.

   For the Father exists as a whole in the Son, and in the Spirit common
   to them; and the Son in the Father, and in the Spirit; and the Spirit
   in the Father, and in the Son; for the memory of the supreme Being
   exists, as a whole, in its intelligence and in its love, and the
   intelligence in its memory and love, and the love in its memory and
   intelligence. For the supreme Spirit conceives of (intelligit) its
   memory as a whole, and loves it, and remembers its intelligence as a
   whole, and loves it as a whole, and remembers its love as a whole, and
   conceives of it as a whole.

   But we mean by the memory, the Father; by the intelligence, the Son; by
   the love, the Spirit of both. In such equality, therefore, do Father
   and Son and Spirit embrace one another, and exist in one another, that
   none of them can be proved to surpass another or to exist without it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LX.

   To none of these is another necessary that he may remember, conceive,
   or love: since each taken by himself is memory and intelligence and
   love and all that is necessarily inherent in the supreme Being.

   BUT, while this discussion engages our attention, I think that this
   truth, which occurs to me as I reflect, ought to be most carefully
   commended to memory. The Father must be so conceived of as memory, the
   Son as intelligence, and the Spirit as love, that it shall also be
   understood that the Father does not need the Son, or the Spirit common
   to them, nor the Son the Father, or the same Spirit, nor the Spirit the
   Father, or the Son: as if the Father were able, through his own power,
   only to remember, but to conceive only through the Son, and to love
   only through the Spirit of himself and his son; and the Son could only
   conceive or understand (intelligere) through himself, but remembered
   through the Father, and loved through his Spirit; and this Spirit were
   able through himself alone only to love, while the Father remembers for
   him, and the Son conceives or understands (intelligit) for him.

   For, since among these three each one taken separately is so perfectly
   the supreme Being and the supreme Wisdom that through himself he
   remembers and conceives and loves, it must be that none of these three
   needs another, in order either to remember or to conceive or to love.
   For, each taken separately is essentially memory and intelligence and
   love, and all that is necessarily inherent in the supreme Being.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXI.

   Yet there are not three, but one Father and one Son and one Spirit.

   AND here I see a question arises. For, if the Father is intelligence
   and love as well as memory, and the Son is memory and love as well as
   intelligence, and the Spirit is no less memory and intelligence than
   love; how is it that the Father is not a Son and a Spirit of some
   being? and why is not the Son the Father and the Spirit of some being?
   and why is not this Spirit the Father of some being, and the Son of
   some being? For it was understood, that the Father was memory, the Son
   intelligence, and the Spirit love.

   But this question is easily answered, if we consider the truths already
   disclosed in our discussion. For the Father, even though he is
   intelligence and love, is not for that reason the Son or the Spirit of
   any being; since he is not intelligence, begotten of any, or love,
   proceeding from any, but whatever he is, he is only the begetter, and
   is he from whom the other proceeds.

   The Son also, even though by his own power he remembers and loves, is
   not, for that reason, the Father or the Spirit of any; since he is not
   memory as begetter, or love as proceeding from another after the
   likeness of his Spirit, but whatever being he has he is only begotten
   and is he from whom the Spirit proceeds.

   The Spirit, too, is not necessarily Father or Son, because his own
   memory and intelligence are sufficient to him; since he is not memory
   as begetter, or intelligence as begotten, but he alone, whatever he is,
   proceeds or emanates.

   What, then, forbids the conclusion that in the supreme Being there is
   only one Father, one Son, one Spirit, and not three Fathers or Sons or
   Spirits?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXII.

   How it seems that of these three more sons than one are born.

   BUT perhaps the following observation will prove inconsistent with this
   assertion. It should not be doubted that the Father and the Son and
   their Spirit each expresses himself and the other two, just as each
   conceives of, and understands, himself and the other two. But, if this
   is true, are there not in the supreme Being as many words as there are
   expressive beings, and as many words as there are beings who are
   expressed?

   For, if more men than one give expression to some one object in
   thought, apparently there are as many words corresponding to that
   object as there are thinkers; since the word corresponding to it exists
   in the thoughts of each separately. Again, if one man thinks of more
   objects than one, there are as many words in the mind of the thinker as
   there are objects thought of.

   But in the thought of a man, when he thinks of anything outside his own
   mind, the word corresponding to the object thought of is not born of
   the object itself, since that is absent from the view of thought, but
   of some likeness or image of the object which exists in the memory of
   the thinker, or which is perhaps called to mind through a corporeal
   sense from the present object itself.

   But in the supreme Being, Father and Son and their Spirit are always so
   present to one another--for each one, as we have already seen, exists
   in the others no less than in himself--that, when they express one
   another, the one that is expressed seems to beget his own word, just as
   when he is expressed by himself. How is it, then, that the Son and the
   Spirit of the Son and of the Father beget nothing, if each begets his
   own word, when he is expressed by himself or by another? Apparently as
   many words as can be proved to be born of the supreme Substance, so
   many Sons, according to our former reasoning, must there be begotten of
   this substance, and so many spirits proceeding from it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXIII.

   How among them there is only one Son of one Father, that is, one Word,
   and that from the Father alone.

   ON these grounds, therefore, there apparently are in that Being, not
   only many fathers and sons and beings proceeding from it, but other
   necessary attributes as well; or else Father and Son and their Spirit,
   of whom it is already certain that they truly exist, are not three
   expressive beings, although each taken separately is expressive, nor
   are there more beings than one expressed, when each one expresses
   himself and the other two.

   For, just as it is an inherent property of the supreme Wisdom to know
   and conceive, so it is assuredly natural to eternal and immutable
   knowledge and intelligence ever to regard as present what it knows and
   conceives of. For, to such a supreme Spirit expressing and beholding
   through conception, as it were, are the same, just as the expression of
   our human mind is nothing but the intuition of the thinker.

   But reasons already considered have shown most convincingly that
   whatever is essentially inherent in the supreme Nature is perfectly
   consistent with the nature of the Father and the Son and their Spirit
   taken separately; and that, nevertheless, this, if attributed to the
   three at once, does not admit of plurality. Now, it is established that
   as knowledge and intelligence are attributes of his being, so his
   knowing and conceiving is nothing else than his expression, that is,
   his ever beholding as present what he knows and conceives of.
   Necessarily, therefore, just as the Father separately, and the Son
   separately, and their Spirit separately, is a knowing and conceiving
   being, and yet the three at once are not more knowing and conceiving
   beings than one, but one knowing and one conceiving being: so, each
   taken separately is expressive, and yet there are not three expressive
   beings at once, but one expressive being.

   Hence, this fact may also be clearly recognised, that when these three
   are expressed, either by themselves or by another, there are not more
   beings than one expressed. For what is therein expressed except their
   being? If, then, that Being is one and only one, then what is expressed
   is one and only one; therefore, if it is in them one and only one which
   expresses, and one which is expressed--for it is one wisdom which
   expresses and one substance which is expressed--it follows that there
   are not more words than one, but one alone. Hence, although each one
   expresses himself and all express one another, nevertheless there
   cannot be in the supreme Being another Word than that already shown to
   be born of him whose is the Word, so that it may be called his true
   image and his Son.

   And in this truth I find a strange and inexplicable factor. For
   observe: although it is manifest that each one, that is, Father and
   Son, and the Spirit of Father and Son equally expresses himself and
   both the others, and that there is one Word alone among them; yet it
   appears that this Word itself can in no wise be called the Word of all
   three, but only of one.

   For it has been proved that it is the image and Son of him whose Word
   it is. And it is plain that it cannot properly be called either the
   image or son of itself, or of the Spirit proceeding from it. For,
   neither of itself nor of a being proceeding from it, is it born, nor
   does it in its existence imitate itself or a being proceeding from
   itself. For it does not imitate itself, or take on a like existence to
   itself, because imitation and likeness are impossible where only one
   being is concerned, but require plurality of beings; while it does not
   imitate the spirit, nor does it exist in his likeness, because it has
   not its existence from that Spirit, but the Spirit from it. It is to be
   concluded that this sole Word corresponds to him alone, from whom it
   has existence by generation, and after whose complete likeness it
   exists.

   One Father, then, and not more than one Father; one Son, and not more
   than one Son; one Spirit proceeding from them, and not more than one
   such Spirit, exist in the supreme Being. And, although there are three,
   so that the Father is never the Son or the Spirit proceeding from them,
   nor the Son at any time the Father or the Spirit, nor the Spirit of
   Father and Son ever the Father or the Son; and each separately is so
   perfect that he is self-sufficient, needing neither of the others; yet
   what they are is in such a way one that just as it cannot be attributed
   to them taken separately as plural, so, neither can it be attributed to
   them as plural, when the three are taken at once. And though each one
   expresses himself and all express one another, yet there are not among
   them more words than one, but one; and this Word corresponds not to
   each separately, nor to all together, but to one alone.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXIV.

   Though this truth is inexplicable, it demands belief.

   IT seems to me that the mystery of so sublime a subject transcends all
   the vision of the human intellect . And for that reason I think it best
   to refrain from the attempt to explain how this thing is. For it is my
   opinion that one who is investigating an incomprehensible object ought
   to be satisfied if this reasoning shall have brought him far enough to
   recognise that this object most certainly exists; nor ought assured
   belief to be the less readily given to these truths which are declared
   to be such by cogent proofs, and without the contradiction of any other
   reason, if, because of the incomprehensibility of their own natural
   sublimity, they do not admit of explanation.

   But what is so incomprehensible, so ineffable, as that which is above
   all things? Hence, if these truths, which have thus far been debated in
   connection with the supreme Being, have been declared on cogent
   grounds, even though they cannot be so examined by the human intellect
   as to be capable of explanation in words, their assured certainty is
   not therefore shaken. For, if a consideration, such as that above,
   rationally comprehends that it is incomprehensible in what way supreme
   Wisdom knows its creatures, of which we necessarily know so many; who
   shall explain how it knows and expresses itself, of which nothing or
   scarcely anything can be known by man? Hence, if it is not by virtue of
   the self-expression of this Wisdom that the Father begets and the Son
   is begotten, who shall tell his generation?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXV.

   How real truth may be reached in the discussion of an ineffable
   subject.

   BUT again, if such is the character of its ineffability,--nay, since it
   is such,--how shall whatever conclusion our discussion has reached
   regarding it in terms of Father, Son, and emanating Spirit be valid?
   For, if it has been explained on true grounds, how is it ineffable? Or,
   if it is ineffable, how can it be such as our discussion has shown? Or,
   could it be explained to a certain extent, and therefore nothing would
   disprove the truth of our argument; but since it could not be
   comprehended at all, for that reason it would be ineffable?

   But how shall we meet the truth that has already been established in
   this very discussion, namely, that the supreme Being is so above and
   beyond every other nature that, whenever any statement is made
   concerning it in words which are also applicable to other natures, the
   sense of these words in this case is by no means that in which they are
   applied to other natures.

   For what sense have I conceived of, in all these words that I have
   thought of, except the common and familiar sense? If, then, the
   familiar sense of words is alien to that Being, whatever I have
   inferred to be attributable to it is not its property. How, then, has
   any truth concerning the supreme Being been discovered, if what has
   been discovered is so alien to that Being? What is to be inferred?

   Or, has there in some sort been some truth discovered regarding this
   incomprehensible object, and in some sort has nothing been proved
   regarding it? For often we speak of things which we do not express with
   precision as they are; but by another expression we indicate what we
   are unwilling or unable to express with precision, as when we speak in
   riddles. And often we see a thing, not precisely as it is in itself,
   but through a likeness or image, as when we look upon a face in a
   mirror. And in this way, we often express and yet do not express, see
   and yet do not see, one and the same object; we express and see it
   through another; we do not express it, and do not see it by virtue of
   its own proper nature.

   On these grounds, then, it appears that there is nothing to disprove
   the truth of our discussion thus far concerning the supreme Nature, and
   yet this Nature itself remains not the less ineffable, if we believe
   that it has never been expressed according to the peculiar nature of
   its own being, but somehow described through another.

   For whatever terms seem applicable to that Nature do not reveal it to
   me in its proper character, but rather intimate it through some
   likeness. For, when I think of the meanings of these terms, I more
   naturally conceive in my mind of what I see in created objects, than of
   what I conceive to transcend all human understanding. For it is
   something much less, nay, something far different, that their meaning
   suggests to my mind, than that the conception of which my mind itself
   attempts to achieve through this shadowy signification.

   For, neither is the term wisdom sufficient to reveal to me that Being,
   through which all things were created from nothing and are preserved
   from nothingness; nor is the term essence capable of expressing to me
   that Being which, through its unique elevation, is far above all
   things, and through its peculiar natural character greatly transcends
   all things.

   In this way, then, is that Nature ineffable, because it is incapable of
   description in words or by any other means; and, at the same time, an
   inference regarding it, which can be reached by the instruction of
   reason or in some other way, as it were in a riddle, is not therefore
   necessarily false.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXVI.

   Through the rational mind is the nearest approach to the supreme Being.

   SINCE it is clear, then, that nothing can be ascertained concerning
   this Nature in terms of its own peculiar character, but only in terms
   of something else, it is certain that a nearer approach toward
   knowledge of it is made through that which approaches it more nearly
   through likeness. For the more like to it anything among created beings
   is proved to be, the more excellent must that created being be by
   nature. Hence, this being, through its greater likeness, assists the
   investigating mind in the approach to supreme Truth; and through its
   more excellent created essence, teaches the more correctly what opinion
   the mind itself ought to form regarding the Creator. So, undoubtedly, a
   greater knowledge of the creative Being is attained, the more nearly
   the creature through which the investigation is made approaches that
   Being. For that every being, in so far as it exists, is like the
   supreme Being, reasons already considered do not permit us to doubt.

   It is evident, then, that as the rational mind alone, among all created
   beings, is capable of rising to the investigation of this Being, so it
   is not the less this same rational mind alone, through which the mind
   itself can most successfully achieve the discovery of this same Being.
   For it has already been acknowledged that this approaches it most
   nearly, through likeness of natural essence. What is more obvious,
   then, than that the more earnestly the rational mind devotes itself to
   learning its own nature, the more effectively does it rise to the
   knowledge of that Being; and the more carelessly it contemplates
   itself, the farther does it descend from the contemplation of that
   Being?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXVII.

   The mind itself is the mirror and image of that Being.

   THEREFORE, the mind may most fitly be said to be its own mirror wherein
   it contemplates, so to speak, the image of what it cannot see face to
   face. For, if the mind itself alone among all created beings is capable
   of remembering and conceiving of and loving itself, I do not see why it
   should be denied that it is the true image of that being which, through
   its memory and intelligence and love, is united in an ineffable
   Trinity. Or, at any rate, it proves itself to be the more truly the
   image of that Being by its power of remembering, conceiving of, and
   loving, that Being. For, the greater and the more like that Being it
   is, the more truly it is recognised to be its image.

   But, it is utterly inconceivable that any rational creature can have
   been naturally endowed with any power so excellent and so like the
   supreme Wisdom as this power of remembering, and conceiving of, and
   loving, the best and greatest of all beings. Hence, no faculty has been
   bestowed on any creature that is so truly the image of the Creator.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXVIII.

   The rational creature was created in order that it might love this
   Being.

   IT seems to follow, then, that the rational creature ought to devote
   itself to nothing so earnestly as to the expression, through voluntary
   performance, of this image which is impressed on it through a natural
   potency. For, not only does it owe its very existence to its creator;
   but the fact that it is known to have no power so important as that of
   remembering, and conceiving of, and loving, the supreme good, proves
   that it ought to wish nothing else so especially.

   For who can deny that whatever within the scope one's power is better,
   ought to prevail with the will? For, to the rational nature rationality
   is the same with the ability to distinguish the just from the not-just,
   the true from the not-true, the good from the not-good, the greater
   good from the lesser; but this power is altogether useless to it, and
   superfluous, unless what it distinguishes it loves or condemns, in
   accordance with the judgment of true discernment.

   From this, then, it seems clear enough that every rational being exists
   for this purpose, that according as, on the grounds of discernment, it
   judges a thing to be more or less good, or not good, so it may love
   that thing in greater or less degree, or reject it.

   It is, therefore, most obvious that the rational creature was created
   for this purpose, that it might love the supreme Being above all other
   goods, as this Being is itself the supreme good; nay, that it might
   love nothing except it, unless because of it; since that Being is good
   through itself, and nothing else is good except through it.

   But the rational being cannot love this Being, unless it has devoted
   itself to remembering and conceiving of it. It is clear, then, that the
   rational creature ought to devote its whole ability and will to
   remembering, and conceiving of, and loving, the supreme good, for which
   end it recognises that it has its very existence.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXIX.

   The soul that ever loves this Essence lives at some time in true
   blessedness.

   BUT there is no doubt that the human soul is a rational creature.
   Hence, it must have been created for this end, that it might love the
   supreme Being. It must, therefore, have been created either for this
   end, that it might love that Being eternally; or for this, that at some
   time it might either voluntarily, or by violence, lose this love.

   But it is impious to suppose that the supreme Wisdom created it for
   this end, that at some time, either it should despise so great a good,
   or, though wishing to keep it, should lose it by some violence. We
   infer, then, that it was created for this end, that it might love the
   supreme Being eternally. But this it cannot do unless it lives forever.
   It was so created, then, that it lives forever, if it forever wills to
   do that for which it was created.

   Hence, it is most incompatible with the nature of the supremely good,
   supremely wise, and omnipotent Creator, that what he has made to exist
   that it might love him, he should make not to exist, so long as it
   truly loves him; and that what he voluntarily gave to a non-loving
   being that it might ever love, he should take away, or permit to be
   taken away, from the loving being, so that necessarily it should not
   love; especially since it should by no means be doubted that he himself
   loves every nature that loves him. Hence, it is manifest that the human
   soul is never deprived of its life, if it forever devotes itself to
   loving the supreme life.

   How, then, shall it live? For is long life so important a matter, if it
   is not secure from the invasion of troubles? For whoever, while he
   lives, is either through fear or through actual suffering subject to
   troubles, or is deceived by a false security, does he not live in
   misery? But, if any one lives in freedom from these troubles, he lives
   in blessedness. But it is most absurd to suppose that any nature that
   forever loves him, who is supremely good and omnipotent, forever lives
   in misery. So, it is plain, that the human soul is of such a character
   that, if it diligently observes that end for which it exists, it at
   some time lives in blessedness, truly secure from death itself and from
   every other trouble.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXX.

   This Being gives itself in return to the creature that loves it, that
   that creature may be eternally blessed.

   THEREFORE it cannot be made to appear true that he who is most just and
   most powerful makes no return to the being that loves him
   perseveringly, to which although it neither existed nor loved him, he
   gave existence that it might be able to be a loving being. For, if he
   makes no return to the loving soul, the most just does not distinguish
   between the soul that loves, and the soul that despises what ought to
   be supremely loved, nor does he love the soul that loves him; or else
   it does not avail to be loved by him; all of which suppositions are
   inconsistent with his nature; hence he does make a return to every soul
   that perseveres in loving him.

   But what is this return? For, if he gave to what was nothing, a
   rational being, that it might be a loving soul, what shall he give to
   the loving soul, if it does not cease to love? If what waits upon love
   is so great, how great is the recompense given to love? And if the
   sustainer of love is such as we declare, of what character is the
   profit? For, if the rational creature, which is useless to itself
   without this love, is with it preeminent among all creatures, assuredly
   nothing can be the reward of love except what is preeminent among all
   natures.

   For this same good, which demands such love toward itself, also
   requires that it be desired by the loving soul. For, who can love
   justice, truth, blessedness, incorruptibility, in such a way as not to
   wish to enjoy them? What return, then, shall the supreme Goodness make
   to the being that loves and desires it, except itself? For, whatever
   else it grants, it does not give in return, since all such bestowals
   neither compensate the love, nor console the loving being, nor satisfy
   the soul that desires this supreme Being.

   Or, if it wishes to be loved and desired, so as to make some other
   return than its love, it wishes to be loved and desired, not for its
   own sake, but for the sake of another; and does not wish to be loved
   itself, but wishes another to be loved; which it is impious to suppose.

   So, it is most true that every rational soul, if, as it should, it
   earnestly devotes itself through love to longing for supreme
   blessedness, shall at some time receive that blessedness to enjoy, that
   what it now sees as through a glass and in a riddle, it may then see
   face to face. But it is most foolish to doubt whether it enjoys that
   blessedness eternally; since, in the enjoyment of that blessedness, it
   will be impossible to turn the soul aside by any fear, or to deceive it
   by false security; nor, having once experienced the need of that
   blessedness, will it be able not to love it; nor will that blessedness
   desert the soul that loves it; nor shall there be anything powerful
   enough to separate them against their will. Hence, the soul that has
   once begun to enjoy supreme Blessedness will be eternally blessed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXI.

   The soul that despises this being will be eternally miserable.

   FROM this it may be inferred, as a certain consequence, that the soul
   which despises the love of the supreme good will incur eternal misery.
   It might be said that it would be justly punished for such contempt if
   it lost existence or life, since it does not employ itself to the end
   for which it was created. But reason in no wise admits such a belief,
   namely, that after such great guilt it is condemned to be what it was
   before all its guilt.

   For, before it existed, it could neither be guilty nor feel a penalty.
   If, then, the soul despising that end for which it was created, dies so
   as to feel nothing, or so as to be nothing at all, its condition will
   be the same when in the greatest guilt and when without all guilt; and
   the supremely wise Justice will not distinguish between what is capable
   of no good and wills no evil, and what is capable of the greatest good
   and wills the greatest evil.

   But it is plain enough that this is a contradiction. Therefore, nothing
   can be more logical, and nothing ought to be believed more confidently
   than that the soul of man is so constituted that, if it scorns loving
   the supreme Being, it suffers eternal misery; that just as the loving
   soul shall rejoice in an eternal reward, so the soul despising that
   Being shall suffer eternal punishment; and as the former shall feel an
   immutable sufficiency, so the latter shall feel an inconsolable need.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXII.

   Every human soul is immortal. And it is either forever miserable, or at
   some time truly blessed.

   BUT if the soul is mortal, of course the loving soul is not eternally
   blessed, nor the soul that scorns this Being eternally miserable.
   Whether, therefore, it loves or scorns that for the love of which it
   was created, it must be immortal. But if there are some rational souls
   which are to be judged as neither loving nor scorning, such as the
   souls of infants seem to be, what opinion shall be held regarding
   these? Are they mortal or immortal? But undoubtedly all human souls are
   of the same nature. Hence, since it is established that some are
   immortal, every human soul must be immortal. But since every living
   being is either never, or at some time, truly secure from all trouble;
   necessarily, also, every human soul is either ever miserable, or at
   some time truly blessed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXIII.

   No soul is unjustly deprived of the supreme good, and every effort must
   be directed toward that good.

   BUT, which souls are unhesitatingly to be judged as so loving that for
   the love of which they were created, that they deserve to enjoy it at
   some time, and which as so scorning it, that they deserve ever to stand
   in need of it; or how and on what ground those which it seems
   impossible to call either loving or scorning are assigned to either
   eternal blessedness or misery,--of all this I think it certainly most
   difficult or even impossible for any mortal to reach an understanding
   through discussion. But that no being is unjustly deprived by the
   supremely great and supremely good Creator of that good for which it
   was created, we ought most assuredly to believe. And toward this good
   every man ought to strive, by loving and desiring it with all his
   heart, and all his soul, and all his mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXIV.

   The supreme Being is to be hoped for.

   BUT the human soul will by no means be able to train itself in this
   purpose, if it despairs of being able to reach what it aims at. Hence,
   devotion to effort is not more profitable to it than hope of attainment
   is necessary.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXV.

   We must believe in this Being, that is, by believing we must reach out
   for it.

   BUT what does not believe cannot love or hope. It is, therefore,
   profitable to this human soul to believe the supreme Being and those
   things without which that Being cannot be loved, that, by believing,
   the soul may reach out for it. And this truth can be more briefly and
   fitly indicated, I think, if instead of saying, "strive for" the
   supreme Being, we say, "believe in" the supreme Being.

   For, if one says that he believes in it, he apparently shows clearly
   enough both that, through the faith which he professes, he strives for
   the supreme Being, and that he believes those things which are proper
   to this aim. For it seems that either he who does not believe what is
   proper to striving for that Being, or he who does not strive for that
   Being, through what he believes, does not believe in it. And, perhaps,
   it is indifferent whether we say, "believe in it," or "direct belief to
   it," just as by believing to strive for it and toward it are the same,
   except that whoever shall have come to it by striving for (tendendo in)
   it, will not remain without, but within it. And this is indicated more
   distinctly and familiarly if we say, "striving for" (in) it, than if we
   say, "toward" (ad) it.

   On this ground, therefore, I think it may more fitly be said that we
   should believe in it, than that we should direct belief to it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXVI.

   We should believe in Father and Son and in their Spirit equally, and in
   each separately, and in the three at once.

   WE should believe, then, equally in the Father and in the Son and in
   their Spirit, and in each separately, and in the three at once, since
   the Father separately, and the Son separately, and their Spirit
   separately is the supreme Being, and at once Father and Son with their
   Spirit are one and the same supreme Being, in which alone every man
   ought to believe; because it is the sole end which in every thought and
   act he ought to strive for. Hence, it is manifest that as none is able
   to strive for that Being, except he believe in it; so to believe it
   avails none, except he strive for it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXVII.

   What is living, and what dead faith.

   HENCE, with however great confidence so important a truth is believed,
   the faith will be useless and, as it were, dead, unless it is strong
   and living through love. For, that the faith which is accompanied by
   sufficient love is by no means idle, if an opportunity of operation
   offers, but rather exercises itself in an abundance of works, as it
   could not do without love, may be proved from this fact alone, that,
   since it loves the supreme Justice, it can scorn nothing that is just,
   it can approve nothing that is unjust. Therefore, seeing that the fact
   of its operation shows that life, without which it could not operate,
   is inherent in it; it is not absurd to say that operative faith is
   alive, because it has the life of love without which it could not
   operate; and that idle faith is not living, because it lacks that life
   of love, with which it would not be idle.

   Hence, if not only he who has lost his sight is called blind, but also
   he who ought to have sight and has it not, why cannot, in like manner,
   faith without love be called dead; not because it has lost its life,
   that is, love; but because it has not the life which it ought always to
   have? As that faith, then, which operates through love is recognised as
   living, so that which is idle, through contempt, is proved to be dead.
   It may, therefore, be said with sufficient fitness that living faith
   believes in that in which we ought to believe; while dead faith merely
   believes that which ought to be believed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXVIII.

   The supreme Being may in some sort be called Three.

   AND so it is evidently expedient for every man to believe in a certain
   ineffable trinal unity, and in one Trinity; one and a unity because of
   its one essence, but trinal and a trinity because of its three--what?
   For, although I can speak of a Trinity because of Father and Son and
   the Spirit of both, who are three; yet I cannot, in one word, show why
   they are three; as if I should call this Being a Trinity because of its
   three persons, just as I would call it a unity because of its one
   substance.

   For three persons are not to be supposed, because all persons which are
   more than one so subsist separately from one another, that there must
   be as many substances as there are persons, a fact that is recognised
   in the case of more men than one, when there are as many persons as
   there are individual substances. Hence, in the supreme Being, just as
   there are not more substances than one, so there are not more persons
   than one.

   So, if one wishes to express to any why they are three, he will say
   that they are Father and Son and the Spirit of both, unless perchance,
   compelled by the lack of a precisely appropriate term, he shall choose
   some one of those terms which cannot be applied in a plural sense to
   the supreme Being, in order to indicate what cannot be expressed in any
   fitting language; as if he should say, for instance, that this
   wonderful Trinity is one essence or nature, and three persons or
   substances.

   For these two terms are more appropriately chosen to describe plurality
   in the supreme Being, because the word person is applied only to an
   individual, rational nature; and the word substance is ordinarily
   applied to individual beings, which especially subsist in plurality.
   For individual beings are especially exposed to, that is, are subject
   to, accidents, and for this reason they more properly receive the name
   sub-stance. Now, it is already manifest that the supreme Being, which
   is subject to no accidents, cannot properly be called a substance,
   except as the word substance is used in the same sense with the word
   Essence. Hence, on this ground, namely, of necessity, that supreme and
   one Trinity or trinal unity may justly be called one Essence and three
   Persons or three Substances.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXIX.

   This Essence itself is God, who alone is lord and ruler of all.

   IT appears, then--nay, it is unhesitatingly declared that what is
   called God is not nothing; and that to this supreme Essence the name
   God is properly given. For every one who says that a God exists,
   whether one or more than one, conceives of him only as of some
   substance which he believes to be above every nature that is not God,
   and that he is to be worshipped of men because of his preeminent
   majesty, and to be appeased for man's own sake because of some imminent
   necessity.

   But what should be so worshipped in accordance with its majesty, and
   what should be so appeased in behalf of any object, as the supremely
   good and supremely powerful Spirit, who is Lord of all and who rules
   all? For, as it is established that through the supreme Good and its
   supremely wise omnipotence all things were created and live, it is most
   inconsistent to suppose that the Spirit himself does not rule the
   beings created by him, or that beings are governed by another less
   powerful or less good, or by no reason at all, but by the confused flow
   of events alone. For it is he alone through whom it is well with every
   creature, and without whom it is well with none, and from whom, and
   through whom, and in whom, are all things.

   Therefore, since he himself alone is not only the beneficent Creator,
   but the most powerful lord, and most wise ruler of all; it is clear
   that it is he alone whom every other nature, according to its whole
   ability, ought to worship in love, and to love in worship; from whom
   all happiness is to be hoped for; with whom refuge from adversity is to
   be sought; to whom supplication for all things is to be offered. Truly,
   therefore, he is not only God, but the only God, ineffably Three and
   One.

   APPENDIX.
     __________________________________________________________________

   IN BEHALF OF THE FOOL.

   AN ANSWER TO THE ARGUMENT OF ANSELM IN THE PROSLOGIUM.

   BY GAUNILON, A MONK OF MARMOUTIER.

   1. IF one doubts or denies the existence of a being of such a nature
   that nothing greater than it can be conceived, he receives this answer:

   The existence of this being is proved, in the first place, by the fact
   that he himself, in his doubt or denial regarding this being, already
   has it in his understanding; for in hearing it spoken of he understands
   what is spoken of. It is proved, therefore, by the fact that what he
   understands must exist not only in his understanding, but in reality
   also.

   And the proof of this is as follows.--It is a greater thing to exist
   both in the understanding and in reality than to be in the
   understanding alone. And if this being is in the understanding alone,
   whatever has even in the past existed in reality will be greater than
   this being. And so that which was greater than all beings will be less
   than some being, and will not be greater than all: which is a manifest
   contradiction.

   And hence, that which is greater than all, already proved to be in the
   understanding, must exist not only in the understanding, but also in
   reality: for otherwise it will not be greater than all other beings.

   2. The fool might make this reply:

   This being is said to be in my understanding already, only because I
   understand what is said. Now could it not with equal justice be said
   that I have in my understanding all manner of unreal objects, having
   absolutely no existence in themselves, because I understand these
   things if one speaks of them, whatever they may be?

   Unless indeed it is shown that this being is of such a character that
   it cannot be held in concept like all unreal objects, or objects whose
   existence is uncertain: and hence I am not able to conceive of it when
   I hear of it, or to hold it in concept; but I must understand it and
   have it in my understanding; because, it seems, I cannot conceive of it
   in any other way than by understanding it, that is, by comprehending in
   my knowledge its existence in reality.

   But if this is the case, in the first place there will be no
   distinction between what has precedence in time--namely, the having of
   an object in the understanding--and what is subsequent in time--namely,
   the understanding that an object exists; as in the example of the
   picture, which exists first in the mind of the painter, and afterwards
   in his work.

   Moreover, the following assertion can hardly be accepted: that this
   being, when it is spoken of and heard of, cannot be conceived not to
   exist in the way in which even God can be conceived not to exist. For
   if this is impossible, what was the object of this argument against one
   who doubts or denies the existence of such a being?

   Finally, that this being so exists that it cannot be perceived by an
   understanding convinced of its own indubitable existence, unless this
   being is afterwards conceived of--this should be proved to me by an
   indisputable argument, but not by that which you have advanced: namely,
   that what I understand, when I hear it, already is in my understanding.
   For thus in my understanding, as I still think, could be all sorts of
   things whose existence is uncertain, or which do not exist at all, if
   some one whose words I should understand mentioned them. And so much
   the more if I should be deceived, as often happens, and believe in
   them: though I do not yet believe in the being whose existence you
   would prove.

   3. Hence, your example of the painter who already has in his
   understanding what he is to paint cannot agree with this argument. For
   the picture, before it is made, is contained in the artificer's art
   itself; and any such thing, existing in the art of an artificer, is
   nothing but a part of his understanding itself. A joiner, St. Augustine
   says, when he is about to make a box in fact, first has it in his art.
   The box which is made in fact is not life; but the box which exists in
   his art is life. For the artificer's soul lives, in which all these
   things are, before they are produced. Why, then, are these things life
   in the living soul of the artificer, unless because they are nothing
   else than the knowledge or understanding of the soul itself?

   With the exception, however, of those facts which are known to pertain
   to the mental nature, whatever, on being heard and thought out by the
   understanding, is perceived to be real, undoubtedly that real object is
   one thing, and the understanding itself, by which the object is
   grasped, is another. Hence, even if it were true that there is a being
   than which a greater is inconceivable: yet to this being, when heard of
   and understood, the not yet created picture in the mind of the painter
   is not analogous.

   4. Let us notice also the point touched on above, with regard to this
   being which is greater than all which can be conceived, and which, it
   is said, can be none other than God himself. I, so far as actual
   knowledge of the object, either from its specific or general character,
   is concerned, am as little able to conceive of this being when I hear
   of it, or to have it in my understanding, as I am to conceive of or
   understand God himself: whom, indeed, for this very reason I can
   conceive not to exist. For I do not know that reality itself which God
   is, nor can I form a conjecture of that reality from some other like
   reality. For you yourself assert that that reality is such that there
   can be nothing else like it.

   For, suppose that I should hear something said of a man absolutely
   unknown to me, of whose very existence I was unaware. Through that
   special or general knowledge by which I know what man is, or what men
   are, I could conceive of him also, according to the reality itself,
   which man is. And yet it would be possible, if the person who told me
   of him deceived me, that the man himself, of whom I conceived, did not
   exist ; since that reality according to which I conceived of him,
   though a no less indisputable fact, was not that man, but any man.

   Hence, I am not able, in the way in which I should have this unreal
   being in concept or in understanding, to have that being of which you
   speak in concept or in understanding, when I hear the word God or the
   words, a being greater than all other beings. For I can conceive of the
   man according to a fact that is real and familiar to me: but of God, or
   a being greater than all others, I could not conceive at all, except
   merely according to the word. And an object can hardly or never be
   conceived according to the word alone.

   For when it is so conceived, it is not so much the word itself (which
   is, indeed, a real thing--that is, the sound of the letters and
   syllables) as the signification of the word, when heard, that is
   conceived. But it is not conceived as by one who knows what is
   generally signified by the word; by whom, that is, it is conceived
   according to a reality and in true conception alone. It is conceived as
   by a man who does not know the object, and conceives of it only in
   accordance with the movement of his mind produced by hearing the word,
   the mind attempting to image for itself the signification of the word
   that is heard. And it would be surprising if in the reality of fact it
   could ever attain to this.

   Thus, it appears, and in no other way, this being is also in my
   understanding, when I hear and understand a person who says that there
   is a being greater than all conceivable beings. So much for the
   assertion that this supreme nature already is in my understanding.

   5. But that this being must exist, not only in the understanding but
   also in reality, is thus proved to me:

   If it did not so exist, whatever exists in reality would be greater
   than it. And so the being which has been already proved to exist in my
   understanding, will not be greater than all other beings.

   I still answer: if it should be said that a being which cannot be even
   conceived in terms of any fact, is in the understanding, I do not deny
   that this being is, accordingly, in my understanding. But since through
   this fact it can in no wise attain to real existence also, I do not yet
   concede to it that existence at all, until some certain proof of it
   shall be given.

   For he who says that this being exists, because otherwise the being
   which is greater than all will not be greater than all, does not attend
   strictly enough to what he is saying. For I do not yet say, no, I even
   deny or doubt that this being is greater than any real object. Nor do I
   concede to it any other existence than this (if it should be called
   existence) which it has when the mind, according to a word merely
   heard, tries to form the image of an object absolutely unknown to it.

   How, then, is the veritable existence of that being proved to me from
   the assumption, by hypothesis, that it is greater than all other
   beings? For I should still deny this, or doubt your demonstration of
   it, to this extent, that I should not admit that this being is in my
   understanding and concept even in the way in which many objects whose
   real existence is uncertain and doubtful, are in my understanding and
   concept. For it should be proved first that this being itself really
   exists somewhere; and then, from the fact that it is greater than all,
   we shall not hesitate to infer that it also subsists in itself.

   6. For example: it is said that somewhere in the ocean is an island,
   which, because of the difficulty, or rather the impossibility, of
   discovering what does not exist, is called the lost island. And they
   say that this island has an inestimable wealth of all manner of riches
   and delicacies in greater abundance than is told of the Islands of the
   Blest; and that having no owner or inhabitant, it is more excellent
   than all other countries , which are inhabited by mankind, in the
   abundance with which it is stored.

   Now if some one should tell me that there is such an island, I should
   easily understand his words, in which there is no difficulty. But
   suppose that he went on to say, as if by a logical inference: "You can
   no longer doubt that this island which is more excellent than all lands
   exists somewhere, since you have no doubt that it is in your
   understanding. And since it is more excellent not to be in the
   understanding alone, but to exist both in the understanding and in
   reality, for this reason it must exist. For if it does not exist, any
   land which really exists will be more excellent than it; and so the
   island already understood by you to be more excellent will not be more
   excellent."

   If a man should try to prove to me by such reasoning that this island
   truly exists, and that its existence should no longer be doubted,
   either I should believe that he was jesting, or I know not which I
   ought to regard as the greater fool: myself, supposing that I should
   allow this proof; or him, if he should suppose that he had established
   with any certainty the existence of this island. For he ought to show
   first that the hypothetical excellence of this island exists as a real
   and indubitable fact, and in no wise as any unreal object, or one whose
   existence is uncertain, in my understanding.

   7. This, in the mean time, is the answer the fool could make to the
   arguments urged against him. When he is assured in the first place that
   this being is so great that its non-existence is not even conceivable,
   and that this in turn is proved on no other ground than the fact that
   otherwise it will not be greater than all things, the fool may make the
   same answer, and say:

   When did I say that any such being exists in reality, that is, a being
   greater than all others?--that on this ground it should be proved to me
   that it also exists in reality to such a degree that it cannot even be
   conceived not to exist? Whereas in the first place it should be in some
   way proved that a nature which is higher, that is, greater and better,
   than all other natures, exists; in order that from this we may then be
   able to prove all attributes which necessarily the being that is
   greater and better than all possesses.

   Moreover, it is said that the non-existence of this being is
   inconceivable. It might better be said, perhaps, that its
   non-existence, or the possibility of its non-existence, is
   unintelligible. For according to the true meaning of the word, unreal
   objects are unintelligible. Yet their existence is conceivable in the
   way in which the fool conceived of the non-existence of God. I am most
   certainly aware of my own existence; but I know, nevertheless, that my
   non-existence is possible. As to that supreme being, moreover, which
   God is, I understand without any doubt both his existence, and the
   impossibility of his non-existence. Whether, however, so long as I am
   most positively aware of my existence, I can conceive of my
   non-existence, I am not sure. But if I can, why can I not conceive of
   the non-existence of whatever else I know with the same certainty? If,
   however, I cannot, God will not be the only being of which it can be
   said, it is impossible to conceive of his non-existence.

   8. The other parts of this book are argued with such truth, such
   brilliancy, such grandeur; and are so replete with usefulness, so
   fragrant with a certain perfume of devout and holy feeling, that though
   there are matters in the beginning which, however rightly sensed, are
   weakly presented, the rest of the work should not be rejected on this
   account. The rather ought these earlier matters to be reasoned more
   cogently, and the whole to be received with great respect and honor.

   ANSELM'S APOLOGETIC.

   IN REPLY TO GAUNILON'S ANSWER IN BEHALF OF THE FOOL.

   IT was a fool against whom the argument of my Proslogium was directed.
   Seeing, however, that the author of these objections is by no means a
   fool, and is a Catholic, speaking in behalf of the fool, I think it
   sufficient that I answer the Catholic.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   A general refutation of Gaunilon's argument. It is shown that a being
   than which a greater cannot be conceived exists in reality.

   YOU say--whosoever you may be, who say that a fool is capable of making
   these statements--that a being than which a greater cannot be conceived
   is not in the understanding in any other sense than that in which a
   being that is altogether inconceivable in terms of reality, is in the
   understanding. You say that the inference that this being exists in
   reality, from the fact that it is in the understanding, is no more just
   than the inference that a lost island most certainly exists, from the
   fact that when it is described the hearer does not doubt that it is in
   his understanding.

   But I say: if a being than which a greater is inconceivable is not
   understood or conceived, and is not in the understanding or in concept,
   certainly either God is not a being than which a greater is
   inconceivable, or else he is not understood or conceived, and is not in
   the understanding or in concept. But I call on your faith and
   conscience to attest that this is most false. Hence, that than which a
   greater cannot be conceived is truly understood and conceived, and is
   in the understanding and in concept. Therefore either the grounds on
   which you try to controvert me are not true, or else the inference
   which you think to base logically on those grounds is not justified.

   But you hold, moreover, that supposing that a being than which a
   greater cannot be conceived is understood, it does not follow that this
   being is in the understanding; nor, if it is in the understanding, does
   it therefore exist in reality.

   In answer to this, I maintain positively: if that being can be even
   conceived to be, it must exist in reality. For that than which a
   greater is inconceivable cannot be conceived except as without
   beginning. But whatever can be conceived to exist, and does not exist,
   can be conceived to exist through a beginning. Hence what can be
   conceived to exist, but does not exist, is not the being than which a
   greater cannot be conceived. Therefore, if such a being can be
   conceived to exist, necessarily it does exist.

   Furthermore: if it can be conceived at all, it must exist. For no one
   who denies or doubts the existence of a being than which a greater is
   inconceivable, denies or doubts that if it did exist, its
   non-existence, either in reality or in the understanding, would be
   impossible. For otherwise it would not be a being than which a greater
   cannot be conceived. But as to whatever can be conceived, but does not
   exist--if there were such a being, its non-existence, either in reality
   or in the understanding, would be possible. Therefore if a being than
   which a greater is inconceivable can be even conceived, it cannot be
   nonexistent.

   But let us suppose that it does not exist, even if it can be conceived.
   Whatever can be conceived, but does not exist, if it existed, would not
   be a being than which a greater is inconceivable. If, then, there were
   a being a greater than which is inconceivable, it would not be a being
   than which a greater is inconceivable: which is most absurd. Hence, it
   is false to deny that a being than which a greater cannot be conceived
   exists, if it can be even conceived; much the more, therefore, if it
   can be understood or can be in the understanding.

   Moreover, I will venture to make this assertion: without doubt,
   whatever at any place or at any time does not exist--even if it does
   exist at some place or at some time--can be conceived to exist nowhere
   and never, as at some place and at some time it does not exist. For
   what did not exist yesterday, and exists to-day, as it is understood
   not to have existed yesterday, so it can be apprehended by the
   intelligence that it never exists. And what is not here, and is
   elsewhere, can be conceived to be nowhere, just as it is not here. So
   with regard to an object of which the individual parts do not exist at
   the same places or times: all its parts and therefore its very whole
   can be conceived to exist nowhere or never.

   For, although time is said to exist always, and the world everywhere,
   yet time does not as a whole exist always, nor the world as a whole
   everywhere. And as individual parts of time do not exist when others
   exist, so they can be conceived never to exist. And so it can be
   apprehended by the intelligence that individual parts of the world
   exist nowhere, as they do not exist where other parts exist. Moreover,
   what is composed of parts can be dissolved in concept, and be
   non-existent. Therefore, whatever at any place or at any time does not
   exist as a whole, even if it is existent, can be conceived not to
   exist.

   But that than which a greater cannot be conceived, if it exists, cannot
   be conceived not to exist. Otherwise, it is not a being than which a
   greater cannot be conceived: which is inconsistent. By no means, then,
   does it at any place or at any time fail to exist as a whole: but it
   exists as a whole everywhere and always.

   Do you believe that this being can in some way be conceived or
   understood, or that the being with regard to which these things are
   understood can be in concept or in the understanding? For if it cannot,
   these things cannot be understood with reference to it. But if you say
   that it is not understood and that it is not in the understanding,
   because it is not thoroughly understood; you should say that a man who
   cannot face the direct rays of the sun does not see the light of day,
   which is none other than the sunlight. Assuredly a being than which a
   greater cannot be conceived exists, and is in the understanding, at
   least to this extent--that these statements regarding it are
   understood.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

   The argument is continued. It is shown that a being than which a
   greater is inconceivable can be conceived, and also, in so far, exists.

   I HAVE said, then, in the argument which you dispute, that when the
   fool hears mentioned a being than which a greater is inconceivable, he
   understands what he hears. Certainly a man who does not understand when
   a familiar language is spoken, has no understanding at all, or a very
   dull one. Moreover, I have said that if this being is understood, it is
   in the understanding. Is that in no understanding which has been proved
   necessarily to exist in the reality of fact?

   But you will say that although it is in the understanding, it does not
   follow that it is understood. But observe that the fact of its being
   understood does necessitate its being in the understanding. For as what
   is conceived, is conceived by conception, and what is conceived by
   conception, as it is conceived, so is in conception; so what is
   understood, is understood by understanding, and what is understood by
   understanding, as it is understood, so is in the understanding. What
   can be more clear than this?

   After this, I have said that if it is even in the understanding alone,
   it can be conceived also to exist in reality, which is greater. If,
   then, it is in the understanding alone, obviously the very being than
   which greater cannot be conceived is one than which a greater can be
   conceived. What is more logical? For if it exists even in the
   understanding alone, can it not be conceived also to exist in reality?
   And if it can be so conceived, does not he who conceives of this
   conceive of a thing greater than that being, if it exists in the
   understanding alone? What more consistent inference, then, can be made
   than this: that if a being than which a greater cannot be conceived is
   in the understanding alone, it is not that than which a greater cannot
   be conceived?

   But, assuredly, in no understanding is a being than which a greater is
   conceivable a being than which a greater is inconceivable. Does it not
   follow, then, that if a being than which a greater cannot be conceived
   is in any understanding, it does not exist in the understanding alone?
   For if it is in the understanding alone, it is a being than which a
   greater can be conceived, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

   A criticism of Gaunilon's example, in which he tries to show that in
   this way the real existence of a lost island might be inferred from the
   fact of its being conceived.

   BUT, you say, it is as if one should suppose an island in the ocean,
   which surpasses all lands in its fertility, and which, because of the
   difficulty, or the impossibility, of discovering what does not exist,
   is called a lost island; and should say that there can no doubt that
   this island truly exists in reality, for this reason, that one who
   hears it described easily understands what he hears.

   Now I promise confidently that if any man shall devise anything
   existing either in reality or in concept alone (except that than which
   a greater be conceived) to which he can adapt the sequence of my
   reasoning, I will discover that thing, and will give him his lost
   island, not to be lost again.

   But it now appears that this being than which a greater is
   inconceivable cannot be conceived not to be, because it exists on so
   assured a ground of truth; for otherwise it would not exist at all.

   Hence, if any one says that he conceives this being not to exist, I say
   that at the time when he conceives of this either he conceives of a
   being than which a greater is inconceivable, or he does not conceive at
   all. If he does not conceive, he does not conceive of the non-existence
   of that of which he does not conceive. But if he does conceive, he
   certainly conceives of a being which cannot be even conceived not to
   exist. For if it could be conceived not to exist, it could be conceived
   to have a beginning and an end. But this is impossible.

   He, then, who conceives of this being conceives of a being which cannot
   be even conceived not to exist; but he who conceives of this being does
   not conceive that it does not exist; else he conceives what is
   inconceivable. The non-existence, then, of that than which a greater
   cannot be conceived is inconceivable.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

   The difference between the possibility of conceiving of non-existence,
   and understanding non-existence.

   YOU say, moreover, that whereas I assert that this supreme being cannot
   be conceived not to exist, it might better be said that its
   non-existence, or even the possibility of its non-existence, cannot be
   understood.

   But it was more proper to say, it cannot be conceived. For if I had
   said that the object itself cannot be understood not to exist, possibly
   you yourself, who say that in accordance with the true meaning of the
   term what is unreal cannot be understood, would offer the objection
   that nothing which is can be understood not to be, for the
   non-existence of what exists is unreal: hence God would not be the only
   being of which it could be said, it is impossible to understand its
   non-existence. For thus one of those beings which most certainly exist
   can be understood not to exist in the same way in which certain other
   real objects can be understood not to exist.

   But this objection, assuredly, cannot be urged against the term
   conception, if one considers the matter well. For although no objects
   which exist can be understood not to exist, yet all objects, except
   that which exists in the highest degree, can be conceived not to exist.
   For all those objects, and those alone, can be conceived not to exist,
   which have a beginning or end or composition of parts: also, as I have
   already said, whatever at any place or at any time does not exist as a
   whole.

   That being alone, on the other hand, cannot be conceived not to exist,
   in which any conception discovers neither beginning nor end nor
   composition of parts, and which any conception finds always and
   everywhere as a whole.

   Be assured, then, that you can conceive of your own non-existence,
   although you are most certain that you exist. I am surprised that you
   should have admitted that you are ignorant of this. For we conceive of
   the non-existence of many objects which we know to exist, and of the
   existence of many which we know not to exist; not by forming the
   opinion that they so exist, but by imagining that they exist as we
   conceive of them.

   And indeed, we can conceive of the non-existence of an object, although
   we know it to exist, because at the same time we can conceive of the
   former and know the latter. And we cannot conceive of the nonexistence
   of an object, so long as we know it to exist, because we cannot
   conceive at the same time of existence and non-existence.

   If, then, one will thus distinguish these two senses of this statement,
   he will understand that nothing, so long as it is known to exist, can
   be conceived not to exist; and that whatever exists, except that being
   than which a greater cannot be conceived, can be conceived not to
   exist, even when it is known to exist.

   So, then, of God alone it can be said that it is impossible to conceive
   of his non-existence; and yet many objects, so long as they exist, in
   one sense cannot be conceived not to exist. But in what sense God is to
   be conceived not to exist, I think has been shown clearly enough in my
   book.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

   A particular discussion of certain statements of Gaunilon's. In the
   first place, he misquoted the argument which he undertook to refute.

   THE nature of the other objections which you, in behalf of the fool,
   urge against me it is easy, even for a man of small wisdom, to detect;
   and I had therefore thought it unnecessary to show this. But since I
   hear that some readers of these objections think they have some weight
   against me, I will discuss them briefly.

   In the first place, you often repeat that I assert that what is greater
   than all other beings is in the understanding; and if it is in the
   understanding, it exists also in reality, for otherwise the being which
   is greater than all would not be greater than all.

   Nowhere in all my writings is such a demonstration found. For the real
   existence of a being which is said to be greater than all other beings
   cannot be demonstrated in the same way with the real existence of one
   that is said to be a being than which a greater cannot be conceived.

   If it should be said that a being than which a greater cannot be
   conceived has no real existence, or that it is possible that it does
   not exist, or even that it can be conceived not to exist, such an
   assertion can be easily refuted. For the non-existence of what does not
   exist is possible, and that whose non-existence is possible can be
   conceived not to exist. But whatever can be conceived not to exist, if
   it exists, is not a being than which a greater cannot be conceived; but
   if it does not exist, it would not, even if it existed, be a being than
   which a greater cannot be conceived. But it cannot be said that a being
   than which a greater is inconceivable, if it exists, is not a being
   than which a greater is inconceivable; or that if it existed, it would
   not be a being than which a greater is inconceivable.

   It is evident, then, that neither is it non-existent, nor is it
   possible that it does not exist, nor can it be conceived not to exist.
   For otherwise, if it exists, it is not that which it is said to be in
   the hypothesis; and if it existed, it would not be what it is said to
   be in the hypothesis.

   But this, it appears, cannot be so easily proved of a being which is
   said to be greater than all other beings. For it is not so evident that
   what can be conceived not to exist is not greater than all existing
   beings, as it is evident that it is not a being than which a greater
   cannot be conceived. Nor is it so indubitable that if a being greater
   than all other beings exists, it is no other than the being than which
   a greater cannot be conceived; or that if it were such a being, some
   other might not be this being in like manner; as it is certain with
   regard to a being which is hypothetically posited as one than which a
   greater cannot be conceived.

   For consider: if one should say that there is a being greater than all
   other beings, and that this being can nevertheless be conceived not to
   exist; and that a being greater than this, although it does not exist,
   can be conceived to exist: can it be so clearly inferred in this case
   that this being is therefore not a being greater than all other
   existing beings, as it would be most positively affirmed in the other
   case, that the being under discussion is not, therefore, a being than
   which a greater cannot be conceived?

   For the former conclusion requires another premise than the
   predication, greater than all other beings. In my argument, on the
   other hand, there is no need of any other than this very predication, a
   being than which a greater cannot be conceived.

   If the same proof cannot be applied when the being in question is
   predicated to be greater than all others, which can be applied when it
   is predicated to be a being than which a greater cannot be conceived,
   you have unjustly censured me for saying what I did not say; since such
   a predication differs so greatly from that which I actually made. If,
   on the other hand, the other argument is valid, you ought not to blame
   me so for having said what can be proved.

   Whether this can be proved, however, he will easily decide who
   recognises that this being than which a greater cannot be conceived is
   demonstrable. For by no means can this being than which a greater
   cannot be conceived be understood as any other than that which alone is
   greater than all. Hence, just as that than which a greater cannot be
   conceived is understood, and is in the understanding, and for that
   reason is asserted to exist in the reality of fact: so what is said to
   be greater than all other beings is understood and is in the
   understanding, and therefore it is necessarily inferred that it exists
   in reality.

   You see, then, with how much justice you have compared me with your
   fool, who, on the sole ground that he understands what is described to
   him, would affirm that a lost island exists.

  CHAPTER VI.

   A discussion of Gaunilon's argument in his second chapter: that any
   unreal beings can be understood in the same way, and would, to that
   extent, exist.

   ANOTHER of your objections is that any unreal beings, or beings whose
   existence is uncertain, can be understood and be in the understanding
   in the same way with that being which I discussed. I am surprised that
   you should have conceived this objection, for I was attempting to prove
   what was still uncertain, and contented myself at first with showing
   that this being is understood in any way, and is in the understanding.
   It was my intention to consider, on these grounds, whether this being
   is in the understanding alone, like an unreal object, or whether it
   also exists in fact, as a real being. For if unreal objects, or objects
   whose existence is uncertain, in this way are understood and are in the
   understanding, because, when they are spoken of, the hearer understands
   what the speaker means, there is no reason why that being of which I
   spoke should not be understood and be in the understanding.

   How, moreover, can these two statements of yours be reconciled: (1) the
   assertion that if a man should speak of any unreal objects, whatever
   they might be, you would understand, and (2) the assertion that on
   hearing of that being which does exist, and not in that way in which
   even unreal objects are held in concept, you would not say that you
   conceive of it or have it in concept; since, as you say, you cannot
   conceive of it in any other way than by understanding it, that is, by
   comprehending in your knowledge its real existence?

   How, I ask, can these two things be reconciled: that unreal objects are
   understood, and that understanding an object is comprehending in
   knowledge its real existence? The contradiction does not concern me: do
   you see to it. But if unreal objects are also in some sort understood,
   and your definition is applicable, not to every understanding, but to a
   certain sort of understanding, I ought not to be blamed for saying that
   a being than which a greater cannot be conceived is understood and is
   in the understanding, even before I reached the certain conclusion that
   this being exists in reality.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

   In answer to another objection: that the supremely great being may be
   conceived not to exist, just as by the fool God is conceived not to
   exist.

   AGAIN, you say that it can probably never be believed that this being,
   when it is spoken of and heard of, cannot be conceived not to exist in
   the same way in which even God may be conceived not to exist.

   Such an objection could be answered by those who have attained but
   little skill in disputation and argument. For is it compatible with
   reason for a man to deny the existence of what he understands, because
   it is said to be that being whose existence he denies because he does
   not understand it? Or, if at some times its existence is denied,
   because only to a certain extent is it understood, and that which is
   not at all understood is the same to him: is not what is still
   undetermined more easily proved of a being which exists in some
   understanding than of one which exists is no understanding?

   Hence it cannot be credible that any man denies the existence of a
   being than which a greater cannot be conceived, which, when he hears of
   it, he understands in a certain degree: it is incredible, I say, that
   any man denies the existence of this being because he denies the
   existence of God, the sensory perception of whom he in no wise
   conceives of.

   Or if the existence of another object, because it is not at all
   understood, is denied, yet is not the existence of what is understood
   in some degree more easily proved than the existence of an object which
   is in no wise understood?

   Not irrationally, then, has the hypothesis of a being a greater than
   which cannot be conceived been employed in controverting the fool, for
   the proof of the existence of God: since in some degree he would
   understand such a being, but in no wise could he understand God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

   The example of the picture, treated in Gaunilon's third chapter, is
   examined.--From what source a notion may be formed of the supremely
   great being, of which Gaunilon inquired in his fourth chapter.

   MOREOVER, your so careful demonstration that the being than which a
   greater cannot be conceived is not analogous to the not yet executed
   picture in the understanding of the painter, is quite unnecessary. It
   was not for this purpose that I suggested the preconceived picture. I
   had no thought of asserting that the being which I was discussing is of
   such a nature; but I wished to show that what is not understood to
   exist can be in the understanding.

   Again, you say that when you hear of a being than which a greater is
   inconceivable, you cannot conceive of it in terms of any real object
   known to you either specifically or generally, nor have it in your
   understanding. For, you say, you neither know such a being in itself,
   nor can you form an idea of it from anything like it.

   But obviously this is not true. For everything that is less good, in so
   far as it is good, is like the greater good. It is therefore evident to
   any rational mind, that by ascending from the lesser good to the
   greater, we can form a considerable notion of a being than which a
   greater is inconceivable.

   For instance, who (even if he does not believe that what he conceives
   of exists in reality) supposing that there is some good which has a
   beginning and an end, does not conceive that a good is much better,
   which, if it begins, does not cease to be? And that as the second good
   is better than the first, so that good which has neither beginning nor
   end, though it is ever passing from the past through the present to the
   future, is better than the second? And that far better than this is a
   being--whether any being of such a nature exists or not--which in no
   wise requires change or motion, nor is compelled to undergo change or
   motion?

   Is this inconceivable, or is some being greater than this conceivable?
   Or is not this to form a notion from objects than which a greater is
   conceivable, of the being than which a greater cannot be conceived?
   There is, then, a means of forming a notion of a being than which a
   greater is inconceivable.

   So easily, then, can the fool who does not accept sacred authority be
   refuted, if he denies that a notion may be formed from other objects of
   a being than which a greater is inconceivable. But if any Catholic
   would deny this, let him remember that the invisible things of God,
   from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by
   the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead. (Romans
   i. 20. )
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

   The possibility of understanding and conceiving of the supremely great
   being. The argument advanced against the fool is confirmed.

   BUT even if it were true that a being than which a greater is
   inconceivable cannot be conceived or understood; yet it would not be
   untrue that a being than which a greater cannot be conceived is
   conceivable and intelligible. There is nothing to prevent one's saying
   ineffable, although what is said to be ineffable cannot be spoken of.
   Inconceivable is conceivable, although that to which the word
   inconceivable can be applied is not conceivable. So, when one says,
   that than which nothing greater is conceivable, undoubtedly what is
   heard is conceivable and intelligible, although that being itself, than
   which a greater is inconceivable, cannot be conceived or understood.

   Or, though there is a man so foolish as to say that there is no being
   than which a greater is inconceivable, he will not be so shameless as
   to say that he cannot understand or conceive of what he says. Or, if
   such a man is found, not only ought his words to be rejected, but he
   himself should be contemned.

   Whoever, then, denies the existence of a being than which a greater
   cannot be conceived, at least understands and conceives of the denial
   which he makes. But this denial he cannot understand or conceive of
   without its component terms; and a term of this statement is a being
   than which a greater cannot be conceived. Whoever, then, makes this
   denial, understands and conceives of that than which a greater is
   inconceivable.

   Moreover, it is evident that in the same way it is possible to conceive
   of and understand a being whose non-existence is impossible; but he who
   conceives of this conceives of a greater being than one whose
   nonexistence is possible. Hence, when a being than which a greater is
   inconceivable is conceived, if it is a being whose non-existence is
   possible that is conceived, it is not a being than which a greater
   cannot be conceived. But an object cannot be at once conceived and not
   conceived. Hence he who conceives of a being than which a greater is
   inconceivable, does not conceive of that whose non-existence is
   possible, but of that whose non-existence is impossible. Therefore,
   what he conceives of must exist; for anything whose non-existence is
   possible, is not that of which he conceives.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

   The certainty of the foregoing argument.--The conclusion of the book.

   I BELIEVE that I have shown by an argument which is not weak, but
   sufficiently cogent, that in my former book I proved the real existence
   of a being than which a greater cannot be conceived; and I believe that
   this argument cannot be invalidated by the validity of any objection.
   For so great force does the signification of this reasoning contain in
   itself, that this being which is the subject of discussion, is of
   necessity, from the very fact that it is understood or conceived,
   proved also to exist in reality, and to be whatever we should believe
   of the divine substance.

   For we attribute to the divine substance anything of which it can be
   conceived that it is better to be than not to be that thing. For
   example: it is better to be eternal than not eternal; good, than not
   good; nay, goodness itself, than not goodness itself. But it cannot be
   that anything of this nature is not a property of the being than which
   a greater is inconceivable. Hence, the being than which a greater is
   inconceivable must be whatever should be attributed to the divine
   essence.

   I thank you for your kindness both in your blame and in your praise for
   my book. For since you have commended so generously those parts of it
   which seem to you worthy of acceptance, it is quite evident that you
   have criticised in no unkind spirit those parts of it which seemed to
   you weak.

     __________________________________________________________________

PREFACE.

   THE first part of this book was copied without my knowledge, before the
   work had been completed and revised. I have therefore been obliged to
   finish it as best I could, more hurriedly, and so more briefly, than I
   wished. For had an undisturbed and adequate period been allowed me for
   publishing it, I should have introduced and subjoined many things about
   which I have been silent. For it was while suffering under great
   anguish of heart, the origin and reason of which are known to God,
   that, at the entreaty of others, I began the book in England, and
   finished it when an exile in Capra. From the theme on which it was
   published I have called it Cur Deus Homo, and have divided it into two
   short books. The first contains the objections of infidels, who despise
   the Christian faith because they deem it contrary to reason; and also
   the reply of believers; and, in fine, leaving Christ out of view (as if
   nothing had ever been known of him), it proves, by absolute reasons,
   the impossibility that any man should be saved without him. Again, in
   the second book, likewise, as if nothing were known of Christ, it is
   moreover shown by plain reasoning and fact that human nature was
   ordained for this purpose, viz., that every man should enjoy a happy
   immortality, both in body and in soul; and that it was necessary that
   this design for which man was made should be fulfilled; but that it
   could not be fulfilled unless God became man, and unless all things
   were to take place which we hold with regard to Christ. I request all
   who may wish to copy this book to prefix this brief preface, with the
   heads of the whole work, at its commencement; so that, into whosesoever
   hands it may fall, as he looks on the face of it, there may be nothing
   in the whole body of the work which shall escape his notice.
     __________________________________________________________________

BOOK FIRST.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   The question on which the whole work rests.

   I HAVE been often and most earnestly requested by many, both personally
   and by letter, that I would hand down in writing the proofs of a
   certain doctrine of our faith, which I am accustomed to give to
   inquirers; for they say that these proofs gratify them, and are
   considered sufficient. This they ask, not for the sake of attaining to
   faith by means of reason, but that they may be gladdened by
   understanding and meditating on those things which they believe; and
   that, as far as possible, they may be always ready to convince any one
   who demands of them a reason of that hope which is in us. And this
   question, both infidels are accustomed to bring up against us,
   ridiculing Christian simplicity as absurd; and many believers ponder it
   in their hearts; for what cause or necessity, in sooth, God became man,
   and by his own death, as we believe and affirm, restored life to the
   world; when he might have done this, by means of some other being,
   angelic or human, or merely by his will. Not only the learned, but also
   many unlearned persons interest themselves in this inquiry and seek for
   its solution. Therefore, since many desire to consider this subject,
   and, though it seem very difficult in the investigation, it is yet
   plain to all in the solution, and attractive for the value and beauty
   of the reasoning; although what ought to be sufficient has been said by
   the holy fathers and their successors, yet I will take pains to
   disclose to inquirers what God has seen fit to lay open to me. And
   since investigations, which are carried on by question and answer, are
   thus made more plain to many, and especially to less quick minds, and
   on that account are more gratifying, I will take to argue with me one
   of those persons who agitate this subject; one, who among the rest
   impels me more earnestly to it, so that in this way Boso may question
   and Anselm reply.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

   How those things which are to be said should be received.

   Boso. As the right order requires us to believe the deep things of
   Christian faith before we undertake to discuss them by reason; so to my
   mind it appears a neglect if, after we are established in the faith, we
   do not seek to understand what we believe. Therefore, since I thus
   consider myself to hold the faith of our redemption, by the prevenient
   grace of God, so that, even were I unable in any way to understand what
   I believe, still nothing could shake my constancy; I desire that you
   should discover to me, what, as you know, many besides myself ask, for
   what necessity and cause God, who is omnipotent, should have assumed
   the littleness and weakness of human nature for the sake of its
   renewal?

   Anselm. You ask of me a thing which is above me, and therefore I
   tremble to take in hand subjects too lofty for me, lest, when some one
   may have thought or even seen that I do not satisfy him, he will rather
   believe that I am in error with regard to the substance of the truth,
   than that my intellect is not able to grasp it.

   Boso. You ought not so much to fear this, because you should call to
   mind, on the other hand, that it often happens in the discussion of
   some question that God opens what before lay concealed; and that you
   should hope for the grace of God, because if you liberally impart those
   things which you have freely received, you will be worthy to receive
   higher things to which you have not yet attained.

   Anselm. There is also another thing on account of which I think this
   subject can hardly, or not at all, be discussed between us
   comprehensively; since, for this purpose, there is required a knowledge
   of Power and Necessity and Will and certain other subjects which are so
   related to one another that none of them can be fully examined without
   the rest; and so the discussion of these topics requires a separate
   labor, which, though not very easy, in my opinion, is by no means
   useless; for ignorance of these subjects makes certain things
   difficult, which by acquaintance with them become easy.

   Boso. You can speak so briefly with regard to these things, each in its
   place, that we may both have all that is requisite for the present
   object, and what remains to be said we can put off to another time.

   Anselm. This also much disinclines me from your request, not only that
   the subject is important, but as it is of a form fair above the sons of
   men, so is it of a wisdom fair above the intellect of men. On this
   account, I fear, lest, as I am wont to be incensed against sorry
   artists, when I see our Lord himself painted in an unseemly figure; so
   also it may fall out with me if I should undertake to exhibit so rich a
   theme in rough and vulgar diction.

   Boso. Even this ought not to deter you, because, as you allow any one
   to talk better if he can, so you preclude none from writing more
   elegantly if your language does not please him. But, to cut you off
   from all excuses, you are not to fulfil this request of mine for the
   learned but for me, and those asking the same thing with me.

   Anselm. Since I observe your earnestness and that of those who desire
   this thing with you, out of love and pious zeal, I will try to the best
   of my ability with the assistance of God and your prayers, which, when
   making this request, you have often promised me, not so much to make
   plain what you inquire about, as to inquire with you. But I wish all
   that I say to be received with this understanding, that, if I shall
   have said anything which higher authority does not corroborate, though
   I appear to demonstrate it by argument, yet it is not to be received
   with any further confidence, than as so appearing to me for the time,
   until God in some way make a clearer revelation to me. But if I am in
   any measure able to set your inquiry at rest, it should be concluded
   that a wiser than I will be able to do this more fully; nay, we must
   understand that for all that a man can say or know still deeper grounds
   of so great a truth lie concealed.

   Boso. Suffer me, therefore, to make use of the words of infidels; for
   it is proper for us when we seek to investigate the reasonableness of
   our faith to propose the objections of those who are wholly unwilling
   to submit to the same faith, without the support of reason. For
   although they appeal to reason because they do not believe, but we, on
   the other hand, because we do believe; nevertheless, the thing sought
   is one and the same. And if you bring up anything in reply which sacred
   authority seems to oppose, let it be mine to urge this inconsistency
   until you disprove it.

   Anselm. Speak on according to your pleasure.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

   Objections of infidels and replies of believers.

   Boso. Infidels ridiculing our simplicity charge upon us that we do
   injustice and dishonor to God when we affirm that he descended into the
   womb of a virgin, that he was born of woman, that he grew on the
   nourishment of milk and the food of men; and, passing over many other
   things which seem incompatible with Deity, that he endured fatigue,
   hunger, thirst, stripes and crucifixion among thieves.

   Anselm. We do no injustice or dishonor to God, but give him thanks with
   all the heart, praising and proclaiming the ineffable height of his
   compassion. For the more astonishing a thing it is and beyond
   expectation, that he has restored us from so great and deserved ills in
   which we were, to so great and unmerited blessings which we had
   forfeited; by so much the more has he shown his more exceeding love and
   tenderness towards us. For did they but carefully consider how fitly in
   this way human redemption is secured, they would not ridicule our
   simplicity, but would rather join with us in praising the wise
   beneficence of God. For, as death came upon the human race by the
   disobedience of man, it was fitting that by man's obedience life should
   be restored. And, as sin, the cause of our condemnation, had its origin
   from a woman, so ought the author of our righteousness and salvation to
   be born of a woman. And so also was it proper that the devil, who,
   being man's tempter, had conquered him in eating of the tree, should be
   vanquished by man in the suffering of the tree which man bore. Many
   other things also, if we carefully examine them, give a certain
   indescribable beauty to our redemption as thus procured.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

   How these things appear not decisive to infidels, and merely like so
   many pictures.

   Boso. These things must be admitted to be beautiful, and like so many
   pictures; but, if they have no solid foundation, they do not appear
   sufficient to infidels, as reasons why we ought to believe that God
   wished to suffer the things which we speak of. For when one wishes to
   make a picture, he selects something substantial to paint it upon, so
   that his picture may remain. For no one paints in water or in air,
   because no traces of the picture remain in them. Wherefore, when we
   hold up to infidels these harmonious proportions which you speak of as
   so many pictures of the real thing, since they do not think this belief
   of ours a reality, but only a fiction, they consider us, as it were, to
   be painting upon a cloud. Therefore the rational existence of the truth
   first be shown, I mean, the necessity, which proves that God ought to
   or could have condescended to those things which we affirm. Afterwards,
   to make the body of the truth, so to speak, shine forth more clearly,
   these harmonious proportions, like pictures of the body, must be
   described.

   Anselm. Does not the reason why God ought to do the things we speak of
   seem absolute enough when we consider that the human race, that work of
   his so very precious, was wholly ruined, and that it was not seemly
   that the purpose which God had made concerning man should fall to the
   ground; and, moreover, that this purpose could not be carried into
   effect unless the human race were delivered by their Creator himself?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

   How the redemption of man could not be effected by any other being but
   God.

   Boso. If this deliverance were said to be effected somehow by any other
   being than God (whether it were an angelic or a human being), the mind
   of man would receive it far more patiently. For God could have made
   some man without sin, not of a sinful substance, and not a descendant
   of any man, but just as he made Adam, and by this man it should seem
   that the work we speak of could have been done.

   Anselm. Do you not perceive that, if any other being should rescue man
   from eternal death, man would rightly be adjudged as the servant of
   that being? Now if this be so, he would in no wise be restored to that
   dignity which would have been his had he never sinned. For he, who was
   to be through eternity only the servant of God and an equal with the
   holy angels, would now be the servant of a being who was not God, and
   whom the angels did not serve.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

   How infidels find fault with us for saying that God has redeemed us by
   his death, and thus has shown his love towards us, and that he came to
   overcome the devil for us.

   Boso. This they greatly wonder at, because we call this redemption a
   release. For, say they, in what custody or imprisonment, or under whose
   power were you held, that God could not free you from it, without
   purchasing your redemption by so many sufferings, and finally by his
   own blood? And when we tell them that he freed us from our sins, and
   from his own wrath, and from hell, and from the power of the devil,
   whom he came to vanquish for us, because we were unable to do it, and
   that he purchased for us the kingdom of heaven; and that, by doing all
   these things, he manifested the greatness of his love towards us; they
   answer: If you say that God, who, as you believe, created the universe
   by a word, could not do all these things by a simple command, you
   contradict yourselves, for you make him powerless. Or, if you grant
   that he could have done these things in some other way, but did not
   wish to, how can you vindicate his wisdom, when you assert that he
   desired, without any reason, to suffer things so unbecoming? For these
   things which you bring up are all regulated by his will; for the wrath
   of God is nothing but his desire to punish. If, then, he does not
   desire to punish the sins of men, man is free from his sins, and from
   the wrath of God, and from hell, and from the power of the devil, all
   which things are the sufferings of sin; and, what he had lost by reason
   of these sins, he now regains. For, in whose power is hell, or the
   devil? Or, whose is the kingdom of heaven, if it be not his who created
   all things? Whatever things, therefore, you dread or hope for, all lie
   subject to his will, whom nothing can oppose. If, then, God were
   unwilling to save the human race in any other way than that you
   mention, when he could have done it by his simple will, observe, to say
   the least, how you disparage his wisdom. For, if a man without motive
   should do, by severe toil, a thing which he could have done in some
   easy way, no one would consider him a wise man. As to your statement
   that God has shown in this way how much he loved you, there is no
   argument to support this, unless it be proved that he could not
   otherwise have saved man. For, if he could not have done it otherwise,
   then it was, indeed, necessary for him to manifest his love in this
   way. But now, when he could have saved man differently, why is it that,
   for the sake of displaying his love, he does and suffers the things
   which you enumerate? For does he not show good angels how much he loves
   them, though he suffer no such things as these for them? As to what you
   say of his coming to vanquish the devil for you, with what meaning dare
   you allege this? Is not the omnipotence of God everywhere enthroned?
   How is it, then, that God must needs come down from heaven to vanquish
   the devil? These are the objections with which infidels think they can
   withstand us.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

   How the devil had no justice on his side against man; and why it was,
   that he seemed to have had it, and why God could have freed man in this
   way.

   MOREOVER, I do not see the force of that argument, which we are wont to
   make use of, that God, in order to save men, was bound, as it were, to
   try a contest with the devil in justice, before he did in strength, so
   that, when the devil should put to death that being in whom there was
   nothing worthy of death, and who was God, he should justly lose his
   power over sinners; and that, if it were not so, God would have used
   undue force against the devil, since the devil had a rightful ownership
   of man, for the devil had not seized man with violence, but man had
   freely surrendered to him. It is true that this might well enough be
   said, if the devil or man belonged to any other being than God, or were
   in the power of any but God. But since neither the devil nor man belong
   to any but God, and neither can exist without the exertion of Divine
   power, what cause ought God to try with his own creature (de suo, in
   suo), or what should he do but punish his servant, who had seduced his
   fellow-servant to desert their common Lord and come over to himself;
   who, a traitor, had taken to himself a fugitive; a thief, had taken to
   himself a fellow-thief, with what he had stolen from his Lord. For when
   one was stolen from his Lord by the persuasions of the other, both were
   thieves. For what could be more just than for God to do this? Or,
   should God, the judge of all, snatch man, thus held, out of the power
   of him who holds him so unrighteously, either for the purpose of
   punishing him in some other way than by means of the devil, or of
   sparing him, what injustice would there be in this? For, though man
   deserved to be tormented by the devil, yet the devil tormented him
   unjustly. For man merited punishment, and there was no more suitable
   way for him to be punished than by that being to whom he had given his
   consent to sin. But the infliction of punishment was nothing
   meritorious in the devil; on the other hand, he was even more
   unrighteous in this, because he was not led to it by a love of justice,
   but urged on by a malicious impulse. For he did not do this at the
   command of God, but God's inconceivable wisdom, which happily controls
   even wickedness, permitted it. And, in my opinion, those who think that
   the devil has any right in holding man, are brought to this belief by
   seeing that man is justly exposed to the tormenting of the devil, and
   that God in justice permits this; and therefore they suppose that the
   devil rightly inflicts it. For the very same thing, from opposite
   points of view, is sometimes both just and unjust, and hence, by those
   who do not carefully inspect the matter, is deemed wholly just or
   wholly unjust. Suppose, for example, that one strikes an innocent
   person unjustly, and hence justly deserves to be beaten himself; if,
   however, the one who was beaten, though he ought not to avenge himself,
   yet does strike the person who beat him, then he does it unjustly. And
   hence this violence on the part of the man who returns the blow is
   unjust, because he ought not to avenge himself; but as far as he who
   received the blow is concerned, it is just, for since he gave a blow
   unjustly, he justly deserves to receive one in return. Therefore, from
   opposite views, the same action is both just and unjust, for it may
   chance that one person shall consider it only just, and another only
   unjust. So also the devil is said to torment men justly, because God in
   justice permits this, and man in justice suffers it. But when man is
   said to suffer justly, it is not meant that his just suffering is
   inflicted by the hand of justice itself, but that he is punished by the
   just judgment of God. But if that written decree is brought up, which
   the Apostle says was made against us, and cancelled by the death of
   Christ; and if any one thinks that it was intended by this decree that
   the devil, as if under the writing of a sort of compact, should justly
   demand sin and the punishment of sin, of man, before Christ suffered,
   as a debt for the first sin to which he tempted man, so that in this
   way he seems to prove his right over man, I do not by any means think
   that it is to be so understood. For that writing is not of the devil,
   because it is called the writing of a decree of the devil, but of God.
   For by the just judgment of God it was decreed, and, as it were,
   confirmed by writing, that, since man had sinned, he should not
   henceforth of himself have the power to avoid sin or the punishment of
   sin; for the spirit is out-going and not returning (est enim spiritus
   vadens et non rediens); and he who sins ought not to escape with
   impunity, unless pity spare the sinner, and deliver and restore him.
   Wherefore we ought not to believe that, on account of this writing,
   there can be found any justice on the part of the devil in his
   tormenting man. In fine, as there is never any injustice in a good
   angel, so in an evil angel there can be no justice at all. There was no
   reason, therefore, as respects the devil, why God should not make use
   of his own power against him for the liberation of man.

  CHAPTER VIII.

   How, although the acts of Christ's condescension which we speak of do
   not belong to his divinity, it yet seems improper to infidels that
   these things should be said of him even as a man; and why it appears to
   them that this man did not suffer death of his own will.

   Anselm. The will of God ought to be a sufficient reason for us, when he
   does anything, though we cannot see why he does it. For the will of God
   is never irrational.

   Boso. That is very true, if it be granted that God does wish the thing
   in question; but many will never allow that God does wish anything if
   it be inconsistent with reason.

   Anselm. What do you find inconsistent with reason, in our confessing
   that God desired those things which make up our belief with regard to
   his incarnation?

   Boso. This in brief: that the Most High should stoop to things so
   lowly, that the Almighty should do a thing with such toil.

   Anselm. They who speak thus do not understand our belief. For we affirm
   that the Divine nature is beyond doubt impassible, and that God cannot
   at all be brought down from his exaltation, nor toil in anything which
   he wishes to effect. But we say that the Lord Jesus Christ is very God
   and very man, one person in two natures, and two natures in one person.
   When, therefore, we speak of God as enduring any humiliation or
   infirmity, we do not refer to the majesty of that nature, which cannot
   suffer; but to the feebleness of the human constitution which he
   assumed. And so there remains no ground of objection against our faith.
   For in this way we intend no debasement of the Divine nature, but we
   teach that one person is both Divine and human. In the incarnation of
   God there is no lowering of the Deity; but the nature of man we believe
   to be exalted.

   Boso. Be it so; let nothing be referred to the Divine nature, which is
   spoken of Christ after the manner of human weakness; but how will it
   ever be made out a just or reasonable thing that God should treat or
   suffer to be treated in such a manner, that man whom the Father called
   his beloved Son in whom he was well pleased, and whom the Son made
   himself? For what justice is there in his suffering death for the
   sinner, who was the most just of all men? What man, if he condemned the
   innocent to free the guilty, would not himself be judged worthy of
   condemnation? And so the matter seems to return to the same incongruity
   which is mentioned above. For if he could not save sinners in any other
   way than by condemning the just, where is his omnipotence? If, however,
   he could, but did not wish to, how shall we sustain his wisdom and
   justice?

   Anselm. God the Father did not treat that man as you seem to suppose,
   nor put to death the innocent for the guilty. For the Father did not
   compel him to suffer death, or even allow him to be slain, against his
   will, but of his own accord he endured death for the salvation of men.

   Boso. Though it were not against his will, since he agreed to the will
   of the Father; yet the Father seems to have bound him, as it were, by
   his injunction. For it is said that Christ "humbled himself, being made
   obedient to the Father even unto death, and that the death of the
   cross. For which cause God also hath highly exalted him;" and that "he
   learned obedience from the things which he suffered;" and that God
   spared not his own Son, but gave him up for us all." And likewise the
   Son says: "I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent
   me." And when about to suffer, he says; "As the Father hath given me
   commandment, so I do." Again: "The cup which the Father hath given me,
   shall I not drink it? " And, at another time : "Father, if it be
   possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but
   as thou wilt." And again: "Father, if this cup may not pass from me
   except I drink it, thy will be done." In all these passages it would
   rather appear that Christ endured death by the constraint of obedience,
   than by the inclination of his own free will.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

   How it was of his own accord that he died, and what this means: "he was
   made obedient even unto death; " and: "for which cause God hath highly
   exalted him;" and: "I came not to do my own will; " and: "he spared not
   his own Son;" and: "not as I will, but as thou wilt."

   Anselm. It seems to me that you do not rightly understand the
   difference between what he did at the demand of obedience, and what he
   suffered, not demanded by obedience, but inflicted on him, because he
   kept his obedience perfect.

   Boso. I need to have you explain it more clearly.

   Anselm. Why did the Jews persecute him even unto death?

   Boso. For nothing else, but that, in word and in life, he invariably
   maintained truth and justice.

   Anselm. I believe that God demands this of every rational being, and
   every being owes this in obedience to God.

   Boso. We ought to acknowledge this.

   Anselm. That man, therefore, owed this obedience to God the Father,
   humanity to Deity; and the Father claimed it from him.

   Boso. There is no doubt of this.

   Anselm. Now you see what he did, under the demand of obedience.

   Boso. Very true, and I see also what infliction he endured, because he
   stood firm in obedience. For death was inflicted on him for his
   perseverance in obedience and he endured it; but I do not understand
   how it is that obedience did not demand this.

   Anselm. Ought man to suffer death, if he had never sinned, or should
   God demand this of him?

   Boso. It is on this account that we believe that man would not have
   been subject to death, and that God would not have exacted this of him;
   but I should like to hear the reason of the thing from you.

   Anselm. You acknowledge that the intelligent creature was made holy,
   and for this purpose, viz., to be happy in the enjoyment of God.

   Boso. Yes.

   Anselm. You surely will not think it proper for God to make his
   creature miserable without fault, when he had created him holy that he
   might enjoy a state of blessedness. For it would be a miserable thing
   for man to die against his will.

   Boso. It is plain that, if man had not sinned, God ought not to compel
   him to die.

   Anselm. God did not, therefore, compel Christ to die; but he suffered
   death of his own will, not yielding up his life as an act of obedience,
   but on account of his obedience in maintaining holiness; for he held
   out so firmly in this obedience that he met death on account of it. It
   may, indeed be said, that the Father commanded him to die, when he
   enjoined that upon him on account of which he met death. It was in this
   sense, then, that "as the Father gave him the commandment, so he did,
   and the cup which He gave to him, he drank; and he was made obedient to
   the Father, even unto death;" and thus "he learned obedience from the
   things which he suffered," that is, how far obedience should be
   maintained. Now the word "didicit," which is used, can be understood in
   two ways. For either "didicit" is written for this: he caused others to
   learn; or it is used, because he did learn by experience what he had an
   understanding of before. Again, when the Apostle had said: "he humbled
   himself, being made obedient even unto death, and that the death of the
   cross," he added: "wherefore God also hath exalted him and given him a
   name, which is above every name." And this is similar to what David
   said: "he drank of the brook in the way, therefore did he lift up the
   head." For it is not meant that he could not have attained his
   exaltation in any other way but by obedience unto death; nor is it
   meant that his exaltation was conferred on him, only as a reward of his
   obedience (for he himself said before he suffered, that all things had
   been committed to him by the Father, and that all things belonging to
   the Father were his); but the expression is used because he had agreed
   with the Father and the Holy Spirit, that there was no other way to
   reveal to the world the height of his omnipotence, than by his death.
   For if a thing do not take place, except on condition of something
   else, it is not improperly said to occur by reason of that thing. For
   if we intend to do a thing, but mean to do something else first by
   means of which it may be done; when the first thing which we wish to do
   is done, if the result is such as we intended, it is properly said to
   be on account of the other; since that is now done which caused the
   delay; for it had been determined that the first thing should not be
   done without the other. If, for instance, I propose to cross a river
   only in a boat, though I can cross it in a boat or on horseback, and
   suppose that I delay crossing because the boat is gone; but if
   afterwards I cross, when the boat has returned, it may be properly said
   of me: the boat was ready, and therefore he crossed. And we not only
   use this form of expression, when it is by means of a thing which we
   desire should take place first, but also when we intend to do something
   else, not by means of that thing, but only after it. For if one delays
   taking food because he has not to-day attended the celebration of mass;
   when that has been done which he wished to do first, it is not improper
   to say to him: now take food, for you have now done that for which you
   delayed taking food. Far less, therefore, is the language strange, when
   Christ is said to be exalted on this account, because he endured death;
   for it was through this, and after this, that he determined to
   accomplish his exaltation. This may be understood also in the same way
   as that passage in which it is said that our Lord increased in wisdom,
   and in favor with God; not that this was really the case, but that he
   deported himself as if it were so. For he was exalted after his death,
   as if it were really on account of that. Moreover, that saying of his:
   "I came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me," is
   precisely like that other saying: "My doctrine is not mine;" for what
   one does not have of himself, but of God, he ought not to call his own,
   but God's. Now no one has the truth which he teaches, or a holy will,
   of himself, but of God. Christ, therefore, came not to do his own will,
   but that of the Father; for his holy will was not derived from his
   humanity, but from his divinity. For that sentence: "God spared not his
   own Son, but gave him up for us all," means nothing more than that he
   did not rescue him. For there are found in the Bible many things like
   this. Again, when he says: "Father, if it be possible, let this cup
   pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt;" and "If
   this cup may not pass from me, except I drink it, thy will be done;" he
   signifies by his own will the natural desire of safety, in accordance
   with which human nature shrank from the anguish of death. But he speaks
   of the will of the Father, not because the Father preferred the death
   of the Son to his life; but because the Father was not willing to
   rescue the human race, unless man were to do even as great a thing as
   was signified in the death of Christ. Since reason did not demand of
   another what he could not do, therefore, the Son says that he desires
   his own death. For he preferred to suffer, rather than that the human
   race should be lost; as if he were to say to the Father: "Since thou
   dost not desire the reconciliation of the world to take place in any
   other way, in this respect, I see that thou desirest my death; let thy
   will, therefore, be done, that is, let my death take place, so that the
   world may be reconciled to thee." For we often say that one desires a
   thing, because he does not choose something else, the choice of which
   would preclude the existence of that which he is said to desire; for
   instance, when we say that he who does not choose to close the window
   through which the draft is admitted which puts out the light, wishes
   the light to be extinguished. So the Father desired the death of the
   Son, because he was not willing that the world should be saved in any
   other way, except by man's doing so great a thing as that which I have
   mentioned. And this, since none other could accomplish it, availed as
   much with the Son, who so earnestly desired the salvation of man, as if
   the Father had commanded him to die; and, therefore, "as the Father
   gave him commandment, so he did, and the cup which the Father gave to
   him he drank, being obedient even unto death."
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X

   Likewise on the same topics; and how otherwise they can be correctly
   explained.

   IT is also a fair interpretation that it was by that same holy will by
   which the Son wished to die for the salvation of the world, that the
   Father gave him commandment (yet not by compulsion), and the cup of
   suffering, and spared him not, but gave him up for us and desired his
   death; and that the Son himself was obedient even unto death, and
   learned obedience from the things which he suffered. For as with regard
   to that will which led him to a holy life, he did not have it as a
   human being of himself, but of the Father; so also that will by which
   he desired to die for the accomplishment of so great good, he could not
   have had but from the Father of lights, from whom is every good and
   perfect gift. And as the Father is said to draw by imparting an
   inclination, so there is nothing improper in asserting that he moves
   man. For as the Son says of the Father: "No man cometh to me except the
   Father draw him," he might as well have said, except he move him. In
   like manner, also, could he have declared: "No man layeth down his life
   for my sake, except the Father move or draw him." For since a man is
   drawn or moved by his will to that which he invariably chooses, it is
   not improper to say that God draws or moves him when he gives him this
   will. And in this drawing or impelling it is not to be understood that
   there is any constraint, but a free and grateful clinging to the holy
   will which has been given. If then it cannot be denied that the Father
   drew or moved the Son to death by giving him that will; who does not
   see that, in the same manner, he gave him commandment to endure death
   of his own accord and to take the cup, which he freely drank. And if it
   is right to say that the Son spared not himself, but gave himself for
   us of his own will, who will deny that it is right to say that the
   Father, of whom he had this will, did not spare him but gave him up for
   us, and desired his death? In this way, also, by following the will
   received from the Father invariably, and of his own accord, the Son
   became obedient to Him, even unto death; and learned obedience from the
   things which he suffered; that is, be learned how great was the work to
   be accomplished by obedience. For this is real and sincere obedience
   when a rational being, not of compulsion, but freely, follows the will
   received from God. In other ways, also, we can properly explain the
   Father's desire that the Son should die, though these would appear
   sufficient. For as we say that he desires a thing who causes another to
   desire it; so, also, we say that he desires a thing who approves of the
   desire of another, though he does not cause that desire. Thus when we
   see a man who desires to endure pain with fortitude for the
   accomplishment of some good design; though we acknowledge that we wish
   to have him endure that pain, yet we do not choose, nor take pleasure
   in, his suffering, but in his choice. We are, also, accustomed to say
   that he who can prevent a thing but does not, desires the thing which
   he does not prevent. Since, therefore, the will of the Son pleased the
   Father, and he did not prevent him from choosing, or from fulfilling
   his choice, it is proper to say that he wished the Son to endure death
   so piously and for so great an object, though he was not pleased with
   his suffering. Moreover, he said that the cup must not pass from him,
   except he drank it, not because he could not have escaped death had he
   chosen to; but because, as has been said, the world could not otherwise
   be saved; and it was his fixed choice to suffer death, rather than that
   the world should not be saved. It was for this reason, also, that he
   used those words, viz., to teach the human race that there was no other
   salvation for them but by his death; and not to show that he had no
   power at all to avoid death. For whatsoever things are said of him,
   similar to these which have been mentioned, they are all to be
   explained in accordance with the belief that he died, not by
   compulsion, but of free choice. For he was omnipotent, and it is said
   of him, when he was offered up, that he desired it. And he says
   himself: "I lay down my life that I may take it again; no man taketh it
   from me, but I lay it down of myself; I have power to lay it down, and
   I have power to take it again." A man cannot, therefore, be properly
   said to have been driven to a thing which he does of his own power and
   will.

   Boso. But this simple fact, that God allows him to be so treated, even
   if he were willing, does not seem becoming for such a Father in respect
   to such a Son.

   Anselm. Yes, it is of all things most proper that such a Father should
   acquiesce with such a Son in his desire, if it be praiseworthy as
   relates to the honor of God, and useful for man's salvation, which
   would not otherwise be effected.

   Boso. The question which still troubles us is, how the death of the Son
   can be proved reasonable and necessary. For otherwise, it does not seem
   that the Son ought to desire it, or the Father compel or permit it. For
   the question is, why God could not save man in some other way, and if
   so, why he wished to do it in this way? For it both seems unbecoming
   for God to have saved man in this way; and it is not clear how the
   death of the Son avails for the salvation of man. For it is a strange
   thing if God so delights in, or requires, the blood of the innocent,
   that he neither chooses, nor is able, to spare the guilty without the
   sacrifice of the innocent.

   Anselm. Since, in this inquiry, you take the place of those who are
   unwilling to believe anything not previously proved by reason, I wish
   to have it understood between us that we do not admit anything in the
   least unbecoming to be ascribed to the Deity, and that we do not reject
   the smallest reason if it be not opposed by a greater. For as it is
   impossible to attribute anything in the least unbecoming to God; so any
   reason, however small, if not overbalanced by a greater, has the force
   of necessity.

   Boso. In this matter, I accept nothing more willingly than that this
   agreement should be preserved between us in common.

   Anselm. The question concerns only the incarnation of God, and those
   things which we believe with regard to his taking human nature.

   Boso. It is so.

   Anselm. Let us suppose, then, that the incarnation of God, and the
   things that we affirm of him as man, had never taken place; and be it
   agreed between us that man was made for happiness, which cannot be
   attained in this life, and that no being can ever arrive at happiness,
   save by freedom from sin, and that no man passes this life without sin.
   Let us take for granted, also, the other things, the belief of which is
   necessary for eternal salvation.

   Boso. I grant it; for in these there is nothing which seems unbecoming
   or impossible for God.

   Anselm. Therefore, in order that man may attain happiness, remission of
   sin is necessary.

   Boso. We all hold this.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

   What it is to sin, and to make satisfaction for sin.

   Anselm. We must needs inquire, therefore, in what manner God puts away
   men's sins; and, in order to do this more plainly, let us first
   consider what it is to sin, and what it is to make satisfaction for
   sin.

   Boso. It is yours to explain and mine to listen.

   Anselm. If man or angel always rendered to God his due, he would never
   sin.

   Boso. I cannot deny that.

   Anselm. Therefore to sin is nothing else than not to render to God his
   due.

   Boso. What is the debt which we owe to God?

   Anselm. Every wish of a rational creature should be subject to the will
   of God.

   Boso. Nothing is more true.

   Anselm. This is the debt which man and angel owe to God, and no one who
   pays this debt commits sin; but every one who does not pay it sins.
   This is justice, or uprightness of will, which makes a being just or
   upright in heart, that is, in will; and this is the sole and complete
   debt of honor which we owe to God, and which God requires of us. For it
   is such a will only, when it can be exercised, that does works pleasing
   to God; and when this will cannot be exercised, it is pleasing of
   itself alone, since without it no work is acceptable. He who does not
   render this honor which is due to God, robs God of his own and
   dishonors him; and this is sin. Moreover, so long as he does not
   restore what he has taken away, he remains in fault; and it will not
   suffice merely to restore what has been taken away, but, considering
   the contempt offered, he ought to restore more than he took away. For
   as one who imperils another's safety does not enough by merely
   restoring his safety, without making some compensation for the anguish
   incurred; so he who violates another's honor does not enough by merely
   rendering honor again, but must, according to the extent of the injury
   done, make restoration in some way satisfactory to the person whom he
   has dishonored. We must also observe that when any one pays what he has
   unjustly taken away, he ought to give something which could not have
   been demanded of him, had he not stolen what belonged to another. So
   then, every one who sins ought to pay back the honor of which he has
   robbed God; and this is the satisfaction which every sinner owes to
   God.

   Boso. Since we have determined to follow reason in all these things, I
   am unable to bring any objection against them, although you somewhat
   startle me.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

   Whether it were proper for God to put away sins by compassion alone,
   without any payment of debt.

   Anselm. Let us return and consider whether it were proper for God to
   put away sins by compassion alone, without any payment of the honor
   taken from him.

   Boso. I do not see why it is not proper.

   Anselm. To remit sin in this manner is nothing else than not to punish;
   and since it is not right to cancel sin without compensation or
   punishment; if it be not punished, then is it passed by undischarged.

   Boso. What you say is reasonable.

   Anselm. It is not fitting for God to pass over anything in his kingdom
   undischarged.

   Boso. If I wish to oppose this, I fear to sin.

   Anselm. It is, therefore, not proper for God thus to pass over sin
   unpunished.

   Boso. Thus it follows.

   Anselm. There is also another thing which follows if sin be passed by
   unpunished, viz., that with God there will be no difference between the
   guilty and the not guilty; and this is unbecoming to God.

   Boso. I cannot deny it.

   Anselm. Observe this also. Every one knows that justice to man is
   regulated by law, so that, according to the requirements of law, the
   measure of award is bestowed by God.

   Boso. This is our belief.

   Anselm. But if sin is neither paid for nor punished, it is subject to
   no law.

   Boso. I cannot conceive it to be otherwise.

   Anselm. Injustice, therefore, if it is cancelled by compassion alone,
   is more free than justice, which seems very inconsistent. And to these
   is also added a further incongruity, viz., that it makes injustice like
   God. For as God is subject to no law, so neither is injustice.

   Boso. I cannot withstand your reasoning. But when God commands us in
   every case to forgive those who trespass against us, it seems
   inconsistent to enjoin a thing upon us which it is not proper for him
   to do himself.

   Anselm. There is no inconsistency in God's commanding us not to take
   upon ourselves what belongs to Him alone. For to execute vengeance
   belongs to none but Him who is Lord of all; for when the powers of the
   world rightly accomplish this end, God himself does it who appointed
   them for the purpose.

   Boso. You have obviated the difficulty which I thought to exist; but
   there is another to which I would like to have your answer. For since
   God is so free as to be subject to no law, and to the judgment of no
   one, and is so merciful as that nothing more merciful can be conceived;
   and nothing is right or fit save as he wills; it seems a strange thing
   for us to say that he is wholly unwilling or unable to put away an
   injury done to himself, when we are wont to apply to him for indulgence
   with regard to those offences which we commit against others.

   Anselm. What you say of God's liberty and choice and compassion is
   true; but we ought so to interpret these things as that they may not
   seem to interfere with His dignity. For there is no liberty except as
   regards what is best or fitting; nor should that be called mercy which
   does anything improper for the Divine character. Moreover, when it is
   said that what God wishes is just, and that what He does not wish is
   unjust, we must not understand that if God wished anything improper it
   would be just, simply because he wished it. For if God wishes to lie,
   we must not conclude that it is right to lie, but rather that he is not
   God. For no will can ever wish to lie, unless truth in it is impaired,
   nay, unless the will itself be impaired by forsaking truth. When, then,
   it is said: "If God wishes to lie," the meaning is simply this: "If the
   nature of God is such as that he wishes to lie;" and, therefore, it
   does not follow that falsehood is right, except it be understood in the
   same manner as when we speak of two impossible things: "If this be
   true, then that follows; because neither this nor that is true;" as if
   a man should say: "Supposing water to be dry, and fire to be moist;"
   for neither is the case. Therefore, with regard to these things, to
   speak the whole truth: If God desires a thing, it is right that he
   should desire that which involves no unfitness. For if God chooses that
   it should rain, it is right that it should rain; and if he desires that
   any man should die, then is it right that he should die. Wherefore, if
   it be not fitting for God to do anything unjustly, or out of course, it
   does not belong to his liberty or compassion or will to let the sinner
   go unpunished who makes no return to God of what the sinner has
   defrauded him.

   Boso. You remove from me every possible objection which I had thought
   of bringing against you.

   Anselm. Yet observe why it is not fitting for God to do this.

   Boso. I listen readily to whatever you say.

  CHAPTER XIII.

   How nothing less was to be endured, in the order of things, than that
   the creature should take away the honor due the Creator and not restore
   what he takes away.

   Anselm. In the order of things, there is nothing less to be endured
   than that the creature should take away the honor due the Creator, and
   not restore what he has taken away.

   Boso. Nothing is more plain than this.

   Anselm. But there is no greater injustice suffered than that by which
   so great an evil must be endured.

   Boso. This, also, is plain.

   Anselm. I think, therefore, that you will not say that God ought to
   endure a thing than which no greater injustice is suffered, viz., that
   the creature should not restore to God what he has taken away.

   Boso. No; I think it should be wholly denied.

   Anselm. Again, if there is nothing greater or better than God, there is
   nothing more just than supreme justice, which maintains God's honor in
   the arrangement of things, and which is nothing else but God himself.

   Boso. There is nothing clearer than this.

   Anselm. Therefore God maintains nothing with more justice than the
   honor of his own dignity.

   Boso. I must agree with you.

   Anselm. Does it seem to you that he wholly preserves it, if he allows
   himself to be so defrauded of it as that he should neither receive
   satisfaction nor punish the one defrauding him.

   Boso. I dare not say so.

   Anselm. Therefore the honor taken away must be repaid, or punishment
   must follow; otherwise, either God will not be just to himself, or he
   will be weak in respect to both parties; and this it is impious even to
   think of.

   Boso. I think that nothing more reasonable can be said.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

   How the honor of God exists in the punishment of the wicked.

   Boso. But I wish to hear from you whether the punishment of the sinner
   is an honor to God, or how it is an honor. For if the punishment of the
   sinner is not for God's honor when the sinner does not pay what he took
   away, but is punished, God loses his honor so that he cannot recover
   it. And this seems in contradiction to the things which have been said.

   Anselm. It is impossible for God to lose his honor; for either the
   sinner pays his debt of his own accord, or, if he refuse, God takes it
   from him. For either man renders due submission to God of his own will,
   by avoiding sin or making payment, or else God subjects him to himself
   by torments, even against man's will, and thus shows that he is the
   Lord of man, though man refuses to acknowledge it of his own accord.
   And here we must observe that as man in sinning takes away what belongs
   to God, so God in punishing gets in return what pertains to man. For
   not only does that belong to a man which he has in present possession,
   but also that which it is in his power to have. Therefore, since man
   was so made as to be able to attain happiness by avoiding sin; if, on
   account of his sin, he is deprived of happiness and every good, he
   repays from his own inheritance what he has stolen, though he repay it
   against his will. For although God does not apply what he takes away to
   any object of his own, as man transfers the money which he has taken
   from another to his own use; yet what he takes away serves the purpose
   of his own honor, for this very reason, that it is taken away. For by
   this act he shows that the sinner and all that pertains to him are
   under his subjection.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

   Whether God suffers his honor to be violated even in the least degree.

   Boso. What you say satisfies me. But there is still another point which
   I should like to have you answer. For if, as you make out, God ought to
   sustain his own honor, why does he allow it to be violated even in the
   least degree? For what is in any way made liable to injury is not
   entirely and perfectly preserved.

   Anselm. Nothing can be added to or taken from the honor of God. For
   this honor which belongs to him is in no way subject to injury or
   change. But as the individual creature preserves, naturally or by
   reason, the condition belonging, and, as it were, allotted to him, he
   is said to obey and honor God; and to this, rational nature, which
   possesses intelligence, is especially bound. And when the being chooses
   what he ought, he honors God; not by bestowing anything upon him, but
   because he brings himself freely under God's will and disposal, and
   maintains his own condition in the universe, and the beauty of the
   universe itself, as far as in him lies. But when he does not choose
   what he ought, he dishonors God, as far as the being himself is
   concerned, because he does not submit himself freely to God's disposal.
   And he disturbs the order and beauty of the universe, as relates to
   himself, although he cannot injure nor tarnish the power and majesty of
   God. For if those things which are held together in the circuit of the
   heavens desire to be elsewhere than under the heavens, or to be further
   removed from the heavens, there is no place where they can be but under
   the heavens, nor can they fly from the heavens without also approaching
   them. For both whence and whither and in what way they go, they are
   still under the heavens; and if they are at a greater distance from one
   part of them, they are only so much nearer to the opposite part. And
   so, though man or evil angel refuse to submit to the Divine will and
   appointment, yet he cannot escape it; for if he wishes to fly from a
   will that commands, he falls into the power of a will that punishes.
   And if you ask whither he goes, it is only under the permission of that
   will; and even this wayward choice or action of his becomes
   subservient, under infinite wisdom, to the order and beauty of the
   universe before spoken of. For when it is understood that God brings
   good out of many forms of evil, then the satisfaction for sin freely
   given, or if this be not given, the exaction of punishment, hold their
   own place and orderly beauty in the same universe. For if Divine wisdom
   were not to insist upon things, when wickedness tries to disturb the
   right appointment, there would be, in the very universe which God ought
   to control, an unseemliness springing from the violation of the beauty
   of arrangement, and God would appear to be deficient in his management.
   And these two things are not only unfitting, but consequently
   impossible; so that satisfaction or punishment must needs follow every
   sin.

   Boso. You have relieved my objection.

   Anselm. It is then plain that no one can honor or dishonor God, as he
   is in himself; but the creature, as far as he is concerned, appears to
   do this when he submits or opposes his will to the will of God.

   Boso. I know of nothing which can be said against this.

   Anselm. Let me add something to it.

   Boso. Go on, until I am weary of listening.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

   The reason why the number of angels who fell must be made up from men.

   Anselm. It was proper that God should design to make up for the number
   of angels that fell, from human nature which he created without sin.

   Boso. This is a part of our belief, but still I should like to have
   some reason for it.

   Anselm. You mistake me, for we intended to discuss only the incarnation
   of the Deity, and here you are bringing in other questions.

   Boso. Be not angry with me; "for the Lord loveth a cheerful giver;" and
   no one shows better how cheerfully he gives what he promises, than he
   who gives more than he promises; therefore, tell me freely what I ask.

   Anselm. There is no question that intelligent nature , which finds its
   happiness, both now and forever, in the contemplation of God, was
   foreseen by him in a certain reasonable and complete number, so that
   there would be an unfitness in its being either less or greater. For
   either God did not know in what number it was best to create rational
   beings, which is false; or, if he did know, then he appointed such a
   number as he perceived was most fitting. Wherefore, either the angels
   who fell were made so as to be within that number; or, since they were
   out of that number, they could not continue to exist, and so fell of
   necessity. But this last is an absurd idea.

   Boso. The truth which you set forth is plain.

   Anselm. Therefore, since they ought to be of that number, either their
   number should of necessity be made up, or else rational nature, which
   was foreseen as perfect in number, will remain incomplete. But this
   cannot be.

   Boso. Doubtless, then, the number must be restored.

   Anselm. But this restoration can only be made from human beings, since
   there is no other source.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

   How other angels cannot take the place of those who fell.

   Boso. Why could not they themselves be restored, or other angels
   substituted for them?

   Anselm. When you shall see the difficulty of our restoration, you will
   understand the impossibility of theirs. But other angels cannot be
   substituted for them on this account (to pass over its apparent
   inconsistency with the completeness of the first creation), because
   they ought to be such as the former angels would have been, had they
   never sinned. But the first angels in that case would have persevered
   without ever witnessing the punishment of sin; which, in respect to the
   others who were substituted for them after their fall, was impossible.
   For two beings who stand firm in truth are not equally deserving of
   praise, if one has never seen the punishment of sin, and the other
   forever witnesses its eternal reward. For it must not for a moment be
   supposed that good angels are upheld by the fall of evil angels, but by
   their own virtue. For, as they would have been condemned together, had
   the good sinned with the bad, so, had the unholy stood firm with the
   holy, they would have been likewise upheld. For, if, without the fall
   of a part, the rest could not be upheld, it would follow, either that
   none could ever be upheld, or else that it was necessary for some one
   to fall, in order by his punishment to uphold the rest; but either of
   these suppositions is absurd. Therefore, had all stood, all would have
   been upheld in the same manner as those who stood; and this manner I
   explained, as well as I could, when treating of the reason why God did
   not bestow perseverance upon the devil.

   Boso. You have proved that the evil angels must be restored from the
   human race; and from this reasoning it appears that the number of men
   chosen will not be less than that of fallen angels. But show, if you
   can, whether it will be greater.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

   Whether there will be more holy men than evil angels.

   Anselm. If the angels, before any of them fell, existed in that perfect
   number of which we have spoken, then men were only made to supply the
   place of the lost angels; and it is plain that their number will not be
   greater. But if that number were not found in all the angels together,
   then both the loss and the original deficiency must be made up from
   men, and more men will be chosen than there were fallen angels. And so
   we shall say that men were made not only to restore the diminished
   number, but also to complete the imperfect number.

   Boso. Which is the better theory, that angels were originally made
   perfect in number or that they were not?

   Anselm. I will state my views.

   Boso. I cannot ask more of you.

   Anselm. If man was created after the fall of evil angels, as some
   understand the account in Genesis, I do not think that I can prove from
   this either of these suppositions positively. For it is possible, I
   think, that the angels should have been created perfect in number, and
   that afterwards man was created to complete their number when it had
   been lessened; and it is also possible that they were not perfect in
   number, because God deferred completing the number, as he does even
   now, determining in his own time to create man. Wherefore, either God
   would only complete that which was not yet perfect, or, if it were also
   diminished, He would restore it. But if the whole creation took place
   at once, and those days in which Moses appears to describe a successive
   creation are not to be understood like such days as ours, I cannot see
   how angels could have been created perfect in number. Since, if it were
   so, it seems to me that some, either men or angels, would fall
   immediately, else in heaven's empire there would be more than the
   complete number required. If, therefore, all things were created at one
   and the same time, it should seem that angels, and the first two human
   beings, formed an incomplete number, so that, if no angel fell, the
   deficiency alone should be made up, but if any fell, the lost part
   should be restored; and that human nature, which had stood firm, though
   weaker than that of angels, might, as it were, justify God, and put the
   devil to silence, if he were to attribute his fall to weakness. And in
   case human nature fell, much more would it justify God against the
   devil, and even against itself, because, though made far weaker and of
   a mortal race, yet, in the elect, it would rise from its weakness to an
   estate exalted above that from which the devil was fallen, as far as
   good angels, to whom it should be equal, were advanced after the
   overthrow of the evil, because they persevered. From these reasons, I
   am rather inclined to the belief that there was not, originally, that
   complete number of angels necessary to perfect the celestial state;
   since, supposing that man and angels were not created at the same time,
   this is possible; and it would follow of necessity, if they were
   created at the same time, which is the opinion of the majority, because
   we read: "He, who liveth forever, created all things at once." But if
   the perfection of the created universe is to be understood as
   consisting, not so much in the number of beings, as in the number of
   natures; it follows that human nature was either made to consummate
   this perfection, or that it was superfluous, which we should not dare
   affirm of the nature of the smallest reptile. Wherefore, then, it was
   made for itself, and not merely to restore the number of beings
   possessing another nature. From which it is plain that, even had no
   angel fallen, men would yet have had their place in the celestial
   kingdom. And hence it follows that there was not a perfect number of
   angels, even before a part fell; otherwise, of necessity some men or
   angels must fall, because it would be impossible that any should
   continue beyond the perfect number.

   Boso. You have not labored in vain.

   Anselm. There is, also, as I think, another reason which supports, in
   no small degree, the opinion that angels were not created perfect in
   number.

   Boso. Let us hear it.

   Anselm. Had a perfect number of angels been created, and had man been
   made only to fill the place of the lost angels, it is plain that, had
   not some angels fallen from their happiness, man would never have, been
   exalted to it.

   Boso. We are agreed.

   Anselm. But if any one shall ask: "Since the elect rejoice as much over
   the fall of angels as over their own exaltation, because the one can
   never take place without the other; how can they be justified in this
   unholy joy, or how shall we say that angels are restored by the
   substitution of men, if they (the angels) would have remained free from
   this fault, had they not fallen, viz., from rejoicing over the fall of
   others?" We reply: Cannot men be made free from this fault? nay, how
   ought they to be happy with this fault? With what temerity, then, do we
   say that God neither wishes nor is able to make this substitution
   without this fault!

   Boso. Is not the case similar to that of the Gentiles who were called
   unto faith, because the Jews rejected it?

   Anselm. No; for had the Jews all believed, yet the Gentiles would have
   been called; for "in every nation he that feareth God and worketh
   righteousness is accepted of him." But since the Jews despised the
   apostles, this was the immediate occasion of their turning to the
   Gentiles.

   Boso. I see no way of opposing you.

   Anselm. Whence does that joy which one has over another's fall seem to
   arise?

   Boso. Whence, to be sure, but from the fact that each individual will
   be certain that, had not another fallen, he would never have attained
   the place where he now is?

   Anselm. If, then, no one had this certainty, there would be no cause
   for one to rejoice over the doom of another.

   Boso. So it appears.

   Anselm. Think you that any one of them can have this certainty, if
   their number shall far exceed that of those who fell?

   Boso. I certainly cannot think that any one would or ought to have it.
   For how can any one know whether he were created to restore the part
   diminished, or to make up that which was not yet complete in the number
   necessary to constitute the state? But all are sure that they were made
   with a view to the perfection of that kingdom.

   Anselm. If, then, there shall be a larger number than that of the
   fallen angels, no one can or ought to know that he would not have
   attained this height but for another's fall.

   Boso. That is true.

   Anselm. No one, therefore, will have cause to rejoice over the
   perdition of another.

   Boso. So it appears.

   Anselm. Since, then, we see that if there are more men elected than the
   number of fallen angels, the incongruity will not follow which must
   follow if there are not more men elected; and since it is impossible
   that there should be anything incongruous in that celestial state, it
   becomes a necessary fact that angels were not made perfect in number,
   and that there will be more happy men than doomed angels.

   Boso. I see not how this can be denied.

   Anselm. I think that another reason can be brought to support this
   opinion.

   Boso. You ought then to present it.

   Anselm. We believe that the material substance of the world must be
   renewed, and that this will not take place until the number of the
   elect is accomplished, and that happy kingdom made perfect, and that
   after its completion there will be no change. Whence it may be reasoned
   that God planned to perfect both at the same time, in order that the
   inferior nature, which knew not God, might not be perfected before the
   superior nature which ought to enjoy God; and that the inferior, being
   renewed at the same time with the superior, might, as it were, rejoice
   in its own way; yes, that every creature having so glorious and
   excellent a consummation, might delight in its Creator and in itself,
   in turn, rejoicing always after its own manner, so that what the will
   effects in the rational nature of its own accord, this also the
   irrational creature naturally shows by the arrangement of God. For we
   are wont to rejoice in the fame of our ancestors, as when on the
   birthdays of the saints we delight with festive triumph, rejoicing in
   their honor. And this opinion derives support from the fact that, had
   not Adam sinned, God might yet put off the completion of that state
   until the number of men which he designed should be made out, and men
   themselves be transferred, so to speak, to an immortal state of bodily
   existence. For they had in paradise a kind of immortality, that is, a
   power not to die, but since it was possible for them to die, this power
   was not immortal, as if, indeed, they had not been capable of death.
   But if God determined to bring to perfection, at one and the same time,
   that intelligent and happy state and this earthly and irrational
   nature; it follows that either that state was not complete in the
   number of angels before the destruction of the wicked, but God was
   waiting to complete it by men, when he should renovate the material
   nature of the world; or that, if that kingdom were perfect in number,
   it was not in confirmation, and its confirmation must be deferred, even
   had no one sinned, until that renewal of the world to which we look
   forward; or that, if that confirmation could not be deferred so long,
   the renewal of the world must be hastened that both events might take
   place at the same time. But that God should determine to renew the
   world immediately after it was made, and to destroy in the very
   beginning those things which after this renewal would not exist, before
   any reason appeared for their creation, is simply absurd. It therefore
   follows that, since angels were not complete in number, their
   confirmation will not be long deferred on this account, because the
   renewal of a world just created ought soon to take place, for this is
   not fitting. But that God should wish to put off their confirmation to
   the future renewing of the world seems improper, since he so quickly
   accomplished it in some, and since we know that in regard to our first
   parents, if they had not sinned as they did, he would have confirmed
   them, as well as the angels who persevered. For, although not yet
   advanced to that equality with angels to which men were to attain, when
   the number taken from among them was complete; yet, had they preserved
   their original holiness, so as not to have sinned though tempted, they
   would have been confirmed, with all their offspring, so as never more
   to sin; just as when they were conquered by sin, they were so weakened
   as to be unable, in themselves, to live afterwards without sinning. For
   who dares affirm that wickedness is more powerful to bind a man in
   servitude, after he has yielded to it at the first persuasion, than
   holiness to confirm him in liberty when he has adhered to it in the
   original trial? For as human nature, being included in the person of
   our first parents, was in them wholly won over to sin (with the single
   exception of that man whom God being able to create from a virgin was
   equally able to save from the sin of Adam), so had they not sinned,
   human nature would have wholly conquered. It therefore remains that the
   celestial state was not complete in its original number, but must be
   completed from among men.

   Boso. What you say seems very reasonable to me. But what shall we think
   of that which is said respecting God: "He hath appointed the bounds of
   the people according to the number of the children of Israel;" which
   some, because for the expression "children of Israel" is found
   sometimes "angels of God," explain in this way, that the number of
   elect men taken should be understood as equal to that of good angels?

   Anselm. This is not discordant with the previous opinion, if it be not
   certain that the number of angels who fell is the same as that of those
   who stood. For if there be more elect than evil angels, and elect men
   must needs be substituted for the evil angels, and it is possible for
   them to equal the number of the good angels, in that case there will be
   more holy men than evil angels. But remember with what condition I
   undertook to answer your inquiry, viz., that if I say anything not
   upheld by greater authority, though I appear to demonstrate it, yet it
   should be received with no further certainty than as my opinion for the
   present, until God makes some clearer revelation to me. For I am sure
   that, if I say anything which plainly opposes the Holy Scriptures, it
   is false; and if I am aware of it, I will no longer hold it. But if,
   with regard to subjects in which opposite opinions may be held without
   hazard, as that, for instance, which we now discuss; for if we know not
   whether there are to be more men elected than the number of the lost
   angels, and incline to either of these opinions rather than the other,
   I think the soul is not in danger; if, I say, in questions like this,
   we explain the Divine words so as to make them favor different sides,
   and there is nowhere found anything to decide, beyond doubt, the
   opinion that should be held, I think there is no censure to be given.
   As to the passage which you spoke of: "He hath determined the bounds of
   the people (or tribes) according to the number of the angels of God;"
   or as another translation has it: "according to the number of the
   children of Israel;" since both translations either mean the same
   thing, or are different, without contradicting each other, we may
   understand that good angels only are intended by both expressions,
   "angels of God," and "children of Israel," or that elect men only are
   meant, or that both angels and elect men are included, even the whole
   celestial kingdom. Or by angels of God may be understood holy angels
   only, and by children of Israel, holy men only; or, by children of
   Israel, angels only, and by angels of God, holy men. If good angels are
   intended in both expressions, it is the same as if only "angels of God"
   had been used; but if the whole heavenly kingdom were included, the
   meaning is, that a people, that is, the throng of elect men, is to be
   taken, or that there will be a people in this stage of existence, until
   the appointed number of that kingdom, not yet completed, shall be made
   up from among men. But I do not now see why angels only, or even angels
   and holy men together, are meant by the expression "children of
   Israel"; for it is not improper to call holy men "children of Israel,"
   as they are called "sons of Abraham." And they can also properly be
   called "angels of God," because they imitate the life of angels, and
   they are promised in heaven a likeness to and equality with angels, and
   all who live holy lives are angels of God. Therefore the confessors or
   martyrs are so called; for he who declares and bears witness to the
   truth, he is a messenger of God, that is, his angel. And if a wicked
   man is called a devil, as our Lord says of Judas, because they are
   alike in malice; why should not a good man be called an angel, because
   he follows holiness? Wherefore I think we may say that God hath
   appointed the bounds of the people according to the number of elect
   men, because men will exist and there will be a natural increase among
   them, until the number of elect men is accomplished; and when that
   occurs, the birth of men, which takes place in this life, will cease.
   But if by "angels of God" we only understand holy angels, and by
   "children of Israel " only holy men; it may be explained in two ways:
   that "God hath appointed the bounds of the people according to the
   number of the angels of God," viz., either that so great a people, that
   is, so many men, will be taken as there are holy angels of God, or that
   a people will continue to exist upon earth, until the number of angels
   is completed from among men. And I think there is no other possible
   method of explanation: "he hath appointed the bounds of the people
   according to the number of the children of Israel," that is, that there
   will continue to be a people in this stage of existence, as I said
   above, until the number of holy men is completed. And we infer from
   either translation that as many men will be taken as there were angels
   who remained steadfast. Yet, although lost angels must have their ranks
   filled by men, it does not follow that the number of lost angels was
   equal to that of those who persevered. But if any one affirms this, he
   will have to find means of invalidating the reasons given above, which
   prove, I think, that there was not among angels, before the fall, that
   perfect number before mentioned, and that there are more men to be
   saved than the number of evil angels.

   Boso. I by no means regret that I urged you to these remarks about the
   angels, for it has not been for nought. Now let us return from our
   digression.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

   How man cannot be saved without satisfaction for sin.

   Anselm. It was fitting for God to fill the places of the fallen angels
   from among men.

   Boso. That is certain.

   Anselm. Therefore there ought to be in the heavenly empire as many men
   taken as substitutes for the angels as would correspond with the number
   whose place they shall take, that is, as many as there are good angels
   now; otherwise they who fell will not be restored, and it will follow
   that God either could not accomplish the good which he begun, or he
   will repent of having undertaken it; either of which is absurd.

   Boso. Truly it is fitting that men should be equal with good angels.

   Anselm. Have good angels ever sinned?

   Boso. No.

   Anselm. Can you think that man, who has sinned, and never made
   satisfaction to God for his sin, but only been suffered to go
   unpunished, may become the equal of an angel who has never sinned?

   Boso. These words I can both think of and utter, but can no more
   perceive their meaning than I can make truth out of falsehood.

   Anselm. Therefore it is not fitting that God should take sinful man
   without an atonement, in substitution for lost angels; for truth will
   not suffer man thus to be raised to an equality with holy beings.

   Boso. Reason shows this.

   Anselm. Consider, also, leaving out the question of equality with the
   angels, whether God ought, under such circumstances, to raise man to
   the same or a similar kind of happiness as that which he had before he
   sinned.

   Boso. Tell your opinion, and I will attend to it as well as I can.

   Anselm. Suppose a rich man possessed a choice pearl which had never
   been defiled, and which could not be taken from his hands without his
   permission; and that he determined to commit it to the treasury of his
   dearest and most valuable possessions.

   Boso. I accept your supposition.

   Anselm. What if he should allow it to be struck from his hand and cast
   in the mire, though he might have prevented it; and afterwards taking
   it all soiled by the mire and unwashed, should commit it again to his
   beautiful and loved casket; will you consider him a wise man?

   Boso. How can I? for would it not be far better to keep and preserve
   his pearl pure, than to have it polluted?

   Anselm. Would not God be acting like this, who held man in paradise, as
   it were in his own hand, without sin, and destined to the society of
   angels, and allowed the devil, inflamed with envy, to cast him into the
   mire of sin, though truly with man's consent? For, had God chosen to
   restrain the devil, the devil could not have tempted man. Now I say,
   would not God be acting like this, should he restore man, stained with
   the defilement of sin, unwashed, that is, without any satisfaction, and
   always to remain so; should He restore him at once to paradise, from
   which he had been thrust out?

   Boso. I dare not deny the aptness of your comparison, were God to do
   this, and therefore do not admit that he can do this. For it should
   seem either that he could not accomplish what he designed, or else that
   he repented of his good intent, neither of which things is possible
   with God.

   Anselm. Therefore, consider it settled that, without satisfaction, that
   is, without voluntary payment of the debt, God can neither pass by the
   sin unpunished, nor can the sinner attain that happiness, or happiness
   like that, which he had before he sinned; for man cannot in this way be
   restored, or become such as he was before he sinned.

   Boso. I am wholly unable to refute your reasoning. But what say you to
   this: that we pray God, "put away our sins from us," and every nation
   prays the God of its faith to put away its sins. For, if we pay our
   debt, why do we pray God to put it away? Is not God unjust to demand
   what has already been paid? But if we do not make payment, why do we
   supplicate in vain that he will do what he cannot do, because it is
   unbecoming?

   Anselm. He who does not pay says in vain: "Pardon"; but he who pays
   makes supplication, because prayer is properly connected with the
   payment; for God owes no man anything, but every creature owes God;
   and, therefore, it does not become man to treat with God as with an
   equal. But of this it is not now needful for me to answer you. For when
   you think why Christ died, I think you will see yourself the answer to
   your question.

   Boso. Your reply with regard to this matter suffices me for the
   present. And, moreover, you have so clearly shown that no man can
   attain happiness in sin, or be freed from sin without satisfaction for
   the trespass, that, even were I so disposed, I could not doubt it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XX.

   That satisfaction ought to be proportionate to guilt; and that man is
   of himself unable to accomplish this.

   Anselm. Neither, I think, will you doubt this, that satisfaction should
   be proportionate to guilt.

   Boso. Otherwise sin would remain in a manner exempt from control
   (inordinatum), which cannot be, for God leaves nothing uncontrolled in
   his kingdom. But this is determined, that even the smallest unfitness
   is impossible with God.

   Anselm. Tell me, then, what payment you make God for your sin?

   Boso. Repentance, a broken and contrite heart, self-denial, various
   bodily sufferings, pity in giving and forgiving, and obedience.

   Anselm. What do you give to God in all these?

   Boso. Do I not honor God, when, for his love and fear, in heartfelt
   contrition I give up worldly joy, and despise, amid abstinence and
   toils, the delights and ease of this life, and submit obediently to
   him, freely bestowing my possessions in giving to and releasing others?

   Anselm. When you render anything to God which you owe him, irrespective
   of your past sin, you should not reckon this as the debt which you owe
   for sin. But you owe God every one of those things which you have
   mentioned. For, in this mortal state, there should be such love and
   such desire of attaining the true end of your being, which is the
   meaning of prayer, and such grief that you have not yet reached this
   object, and such fear lest you fail of it, that you should find joy in
   nothing which does not help you or give encouragement of your success.
   For you do not deserve to have a thing which you do not love and desire
   for its own sake, and the want of which at present, together with the
   great danger of never getting it, causes you no grief. This also
   requires one to avoid ease and worldly pleasures such as seduce the
   mind from real rest and pleasure, except so far as you think suffices
   for the accomplishment of that object. But you ought to view the gifts
   which you bestow as a part of your debt, since you know that what you
   give comes not from yourself, but from him whose servant both you are
   and he also to whom you give. And nature herself teaches you to do to
   your fellow servant, man to man, as you would be done by; and that he
   who will not bestow what he has ought not to receive what he has not.
   Of forgiveness, indeed, I speak briefly, for, as we said above,
   vengeance in no sense belongs to you, since you are not your own, nor
   is he who injures you yours or his, but you are both the servants of
   one Lord, made by him out of nothing. And if you avenge yourself upon
   your fellow servant, you proudly assume judgment over him when it is
   the peculiar right of God, the judge of all. But what do you give to
   God by your obedience, which is not owed him already, since he demands
   from you all that you are and have and can become?

   Boso. Truly I dare not say that in all these things I pay any portion
   of my debt to God.

   Anselm. How then do you pay God for your transgression?

   Boso. If in justice I owe God myself and all my powers, even when I do
   not sin, I have nothing left to render to him for my sin.

   Anselm. What will become of you then? How will you be saved?

   Boso. Merely looking at your arguments, I see no way of escape. But,
   turning to my belief, I hope through Christian faith, "which works by
   love," that I may be saved, and the more, since we read that if the
   sinner turns from his iniquity and does what is right, all his
   transgressions shall be forgotten.

   Anselm. This is only said of those who either looked for Christ before
   his coming, or who believe in him since he has appeared. But we set
   aside Christ and his religion as if they did not exist, when we
   proposed to inquire whether his coming were necessary to man's
   salvation.

   Boso. We did so.

   Anselm. Let us then proceed by reason simply.

   Boso. Though you bring me into straits, yet I very much wish you to
   proceed as you have begun.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

   How great a burden sin is.

   Anselm. Suppose that you did not owe any of those things which you have
   brought up as possible payment for your sin, let us inquire whether
   they can satisfy for a sin so small as one look contrary to the will of
   God.

   Boso. Did I not hear you question the thing, I should suppose that a
   single repentant feeling on my part would blot out this sin.

   Anselm. You have not as yet estimated the great burden of sin.

   Boso. Show it me then.

   Anselm. If you should find yourself in the sight of God, and one said
   to you: "Look thither;" and God, on the other hand, should say: "It is
   not my will that you should look;" ask your own heart what there is in
   all existing things which would make it right for you to give that look
   contrary to the will of God.

   Boso. I can find no motive which would make it right; unless, indeed I
   am so situated as to make it necessary for me either to do this, or
   some greater sin.

   Anselm. Put away all such necessity, and ask with regard to this sin
   only whether you can do it even for your own salvation.

   Boso. I see plainly that I cannot.

   Anselm. Not to detain you too long; what if it were necessary either
   that the whole universe, except God himself, should perish and fall
   back into nothing, or else that you should do so small a thing against
   the will of God?

   Boso. When I consider the action itself, it appears very slight; but
   when I view it as contrary to the will of God, I know of nothing so
   grievous, and of no loss that will compare with it; but sometimes we
   oppose another's will without blame in order to preserve his property,
   so that afterwards he is glad that we opposed him.

   Anselm. This is in the case of man, who often does not know what is
   useful for him, or cannot make up his loss; but God is in want of
   nothing, and, should all things perish, can restore them as easily as
   he created them.

   Boso. I must confess that I ought not to oppose the will of God even to
   preserve the whole creation.

   Anselm. What if there were more worlds as full of beings as this?

   Boso. Were they increased to an infinite extent, and held before me in
   like manner, my reply would be the same.

   Anselm. You cannot answer more correctly, but consider, also, should it
   happen that you gave the look contrary to God's will, what payment you
   can make for this sin?

   Boso. I can only repeat what I said before.

   Anselm. So heinous is our sin whenever we knowingly oppose the will of
   God even in the slightest thing; since we are always in his sight, and
   he always enjoins it upon us not to sin.

   Boso. I cannot deny it.

   Anselm. Therefore you make no satisfaction unless you restore something
   greater than the amount of that obligation, which should restrain you
   from committing the sin.

   Boso. Reason seems to demand this, and to make the contrary wholly
   impossible.

   Anselm. Even God cannot raise to happiness any being bound at all by
   the debt of sin, because He ought not to.

   Boso. This decision is most weighty.

   Anselm. Listen to an additional reason which makes it no less difficult
   for man to be reconciled to God.

   Boso. This alone would drive me to despair, were it not for the
   consolation of faith.

   Anselm. But listen.

   Boso. Say on.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

   What contempt man brought upon God, when he allowed himself to be
   conquered by the devil; for which he can make no satisfaction.

   Anselm. Man being made holy was placed in paradise, as it were in the
   place of God, between God and the devil, to conquer the devil by not
   yielding to his temptation, and so to vindicate the honor of God and
   put the devil to shame, because that man, though weaker and dwelling
   upon earth, should not sin though tempted by the devil, while the
   devil, though stronger and in heaven, sinned without any to tempt him.
   And when man could have easily effected this, he, without compulsion
   and of his own accord, allowed himself to be brought over to the will
   of the devil, contrary to the will and honor of God.

   Boso. To what would you bring me?

   Anselm. Decide for yourself if it be not contrary to the honor of God
   for man to be reconciled to Him, with this calumnious reproach still
   heaped upon God; unless man first shall have honored God by overcoming
   the devil, as he dishonored him in yielding to the devil. Now the
   victory ought to be of this kind, that, as in strength and immortal
   vigor, he freely yielded to the devil to sin, and on this account
   justly incurred the penalty of death; so, in his weakness and
   mortality, which he had brought upon himself, he should conquer the
   devil by the pain of death, while wholly avoiding sin. But this cannot
   be done, so long as from the deadly effect of the first transgression,
   man is conceived and born in sin.

   Boso. Again I say that the thing is impossible, and reason approves
   what you say.

   Anselm. Let me mention one thing more, without which man's
   reconciliation cannot be justly effected, and the impossibility is the
   same.

   Boso. You have already presented so many obligations which we ought to
   fulfil, that nothing which you can add will alarm me more.

   Anselm. Yet listen.

   Boso. I will.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

   What man took from God by his sin, which he has no power to repay.

   Anselm. What did man take from God, when he allowed himself to be
   overcome by the devil?

   Boso. Go on to mention, as you have begun, the evil things which can be
   added to those already shown for I am ignorant of them.

   Anselm. Did not man take from God whatever He had purposed to do for
   human nature?

   Boso. There is no denying that.

   Anselm. Listen to the voice of strict justice; and judge according to
   that whether man makes to God a real satisfaction for his sin, unless,
   by overcoming the devil, man restore to God what he took from God in
   allowing himself to be conquered by the devil; so that, as by this
   conquest over man the devil took what belonged to God, and God was the
   loser, so in man's victory the devil may be despoiled, and God recover
   his right.

   Boso. Surely nothing can be more exactly or justly conceived.

   Anselm. Think you that supreme justice can violate this justice?

   Boso. I dare not think it.

   Anselm. Therefore man cannot and ought not by any means to receive from
   God what God designed to give him, unless he return to God everything
   which he took from him; so that, as by man God suffered loss, by man,
   also, He might recover His loss. But this cannot be effected except in
   this way: that, as in the fall of man all human nature was corrupted,
   and, as it were, tainted with sin, and God will not choose one of such
   a race to fill up the number in his heavenly kingdom; so, by man's
   victory, as many men may be justified from sin as are needed to
   complete the number which man was made to fill. But a sinful man can by
   no means do this, for a sinner cannot justify a sinner.

   Boso. There is nothing more just or necessary; but, from all these
   things, the compassion of God and the hope of man seems to fail, as far
   as regards that happiness for which man was made.

   Anselm. Yet wait a little.

   Boso. Have you anything further?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIV.

   How, as long as man does not restore what he owes God, he cannot be
   happy, nor is he excused by want of power.

   Anselm. If a man is called unjust who does not pay his fellow-man a
   debt, much more is he unjust who does not restore what he owes God.

   Boso. If he can pay and yet does not, he is certainly unjust. But if he
   be not able, wherein is he unjust?

   Anselm. Indeed, if the origin of his inability were not in himself,
   there might be some excuse for him. But if in this very impotence lies
   the fault, as it does not lessen the sin, neither does it excuse him
   from paying what is due. Suppose one should assign his slave a certain
   piece of work, and should command him not to throw himself into a
   ditch, which he points out to him and from which he could not extricate
   himself; and suppose that the slave, despising his master's command and
   warning, throws himself into the ditch before pointed out, so as to be
   utterly unable to accomplish the work assigned; think you that his
   inability will at all excuse him for not doing his appointed work?

   Boso. By no means, but will rather increase his crime, since he brought
   his inability upon himself. For doubly hath he sinned, in not doing
   what he was commanded to do and in doing what he was forewarned not to
   do.

   Anselm. Just so inexcusable is man, who has voluntarily brought upon
   himself a debt which he cannot pay, and by his own fault disabled
   himself, so that he can neither escape his previous obligation not to
   sin, nor pay the debt which he has incurred by sin. For his very
   inability is guilt, because he ought not to have it; nay, he ought to
   be free from it; for as it is a crime not to have what he ought, it is
   also a crime to have what he ought not. Therefore, as it is a crime in
   man not to have that power which he received to avoid sin, it is also a
   crime to have that inability by which he can neither do right and avoid
   sin, nor restore the debt which he owes on account of his sin. For it
   is by his own free action that he loses that power, and falls into this
   inability. For not to have the power which one ought to have, is the
   same thing as to have the inability which one ought not to have.
   Therefore man's inability to restore what he owes to God, an inability
   brought upon himself for that very purpose, does not excuse man from
   paying; for the result of sin cannot excuse the sin itself.

   Boso. This argument is exceedingly weighty, and must be true.

   Anselm. Man, then, is unjust in not paying what he owes to God.

   Boso. This is very true; for he is unjust, both in not paying, and in
   not being able to pay.

   Anselm. But no unjust person shall be admitted to happiness; for as
   that happiness is complete in which there is nothing wanting, so it can
   belong to no one who is not so pure as to have no injustice found in
   him.

   Boso. I dare not think otherwise.

   Anselm. He, then, who does not pay God what he owes can never be happy.

   Boso. I cannot deny that this is so.

   Anselm. But if you choose to say that a merciful God remits to the
   suppliant his debt, because he cannot pay; God must be said to dispense
   with one of two things, viz., either this which man ought voluntarily
   to render but cannot, that is, an equivalent for his sin, a thing which
   ought not to be given up even to save the whole universe besides God;
   or else this, which, as I have before said, God was about to take away
   from man by punishment, even against man's will, viz., happiness. But
   if God gives up what man ought freely to render, for the reason that
   man cannot repay it, what is this but saying that God gives up what he
   is unable to obtain? But it is mockery to ascribe such compassion to
   God. But if God gives up what he was about to take from unwilling man,
   because man is unable to restore what he ought to restore freely, He
   abates the punishment and makes man happy on account of his sin,
   because he has what he ought not to have. For he ought not to have this
   inability, and therefore as long as he has it without atonement it is
   his sin. And truly such compassion on the part of God is wholly
   contrary to the Divine justice, which allows nothing but punishment as
   the recompense of sin. Therefore, as God cannot be inconsistent with
   himself, his compassion cannot be of this nature.

   Boso. I think, then, we must look for another mercy than this.

   Anselm. But suppose it were true that God pardons the man who does not
   pay his debt because he cannot.

   Boso. I could wish it were so.

   Anselm. But while man does not make payment, he either wishes to
   restore, or else he does not wish to. Now, if he wishes to do what he
   cannot, he will be needy, and if he does not wish to, he will be
   unjust.

   Boso. Nothing can be plainer.

   Anselm. But whether needy or unjust, he will not be happy.

   Boso. This also is plain.

   Anselm. So long, then, as he does not restore, he will not be happy.

   Boso. If God follows the method of justice, there is no escape for the
   miserable wretch, and God's compassion seems to fail.

   Anselm. You have demanded an explanation; now hear it. I do not deny
   that God is merciful, who preserveth man and beast, according to the
   multitude of his mercies. But we are speaking of that exceeding pity by
   which he makes man happy after this life. And I think that I have amply
   proved, by the reasons given above, that happiness ought not to be
   bestowed upon any one whose sins have not been wholly put away; and
   that this remission ought not to take place, save by the payment of the
   debt incurred by sin, according to the extent of sin. And if you think
   that any objections can be brought against these proofs, you ought to
   mention them.

   Boso. I see not how your reasons can be at all invalidated.

   Anselm. Nor do I, if rightly understood. But even if one of the whole
   number be confirmed by impregnable truth, that should be sufficient.
   For truth is equally secured against all doubt, if it be demonstrably
   proved by one argument as by many.

   Boso. Surely this is so. But how, then, shall man be saved, if he
   neither pays what he owes, and ought not to be saved without paying?
   Or, with what face shall we declare that God, who is rich in mercy
   above human conception, cannot exercise this compassion?

   Anselm. This is the question which you ought to ask of those in whose
   behalf you are speaking, who have no faith in the need of Christ for
   man's salvation, and you should also request them to tell how man can
   be saved without Christ. But, if they are utterly unable to do it, let
   them cease from mocking us, and let them hasten to unite themselves
   with us, who do not doubt that man can be saved through Christ; else
   let them despair of being saved at all. And if this terrifies them, let
   them believe in Christ as we do, that they may be saved.

   Boso. Let me ask you, as I have begun, to show me how a man is saved by
   Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

   How man's salvation by Christ is necessarily possible.

   Anselm. Is it not sufficiently proved that man can be saved by Christ,
   when even infidels do not deny that man can be happy somehow, and it
   has been sufficiently shown that, leaving Christ out of view, no
   salvation can be found for man? For, either by Christ or by some one
   else can man be saved, or else not at all. If, then, it is false that
   man cannot be saved all, or that he can be saved in any other way, his
   salvation must necessarily be by Christ.

   Boso. But what reply will you make to a person who perceives that man
   cannot be saved in any other way, and yet, not understanding how he can
   be saved by Christ, sees fit to declare that there cannot be any
   salvation either by Christ or in any other way?

   Anselm. What reply ought to be made to one who ascribes impossibility
   to a necessary truth, because he does not understand how it can be?

   Boso. That he is a fool.

   Anselm. Then what he says must be despised.

   Boso. Very true; but we ought to show him in what way the thing is true
   which he holds to be impossible.

   Anselm. Do you not perceive, from what we have said above, that it is
   necessary for some men to attain to felicity? For, if it is unfitting
   for God to elevate man with any stain upon him, to that for which he
   made him free from all stain, lest it should seem that God had repented
   of his good intent, or was unable to accomplish his designs; far more
   is it impossible, on account of the same unfitness, that no man should
   be exalted to that state for which he was made. Therefore, a
   satisfaction such as we have above proved necessary for sin, must be
   found apart from the Christian faith, which no reason can show; or else
   we must accept the Christian doctrine. For what is clearly made out by
   absolute reasoning ought by no means to be questioned, even though the
   method of it be not understood.

   Boso. What you say is true.

   Anselm. Why, then, do you question further?

   Boso. I come not for this purpose, to have you remove doubts from my
   faith, but to have you show me the reason for my confidence. Therefore,
   as you have brought me thus far by your reasoning, so that I perceive
   that man as a sinner owes God for his sin what he is unable to pay, and
   cannot be saved without paying; I wish you would go further with me,
   and enable me to understand, by force of reasoning, the fitness of all
   those things which the Catholic faith enjoins upon us with regard to
   Christ, if we hope to be saved; and how they avail for the salvation of
   man, and how God saves man by compassion; when he never remits his sin,
   unless man shall have rendered what was due on account of his sin. And,
   to make your reasoning the clearer, begin at the beginning, so as to
   rest it upon a strong foundation.

   Anselm. Now God help me, for you do not spare me in the least, nor
   consider the weakness of my skill, when you enjoin so great a work upon
   me. Yet I will attempt it, as I have begun, not trusting in myself but
   in God, and will do what I can with his help. But let us separate the
   things which remain to be said from those which have been said, by a
   new introduction, lest by their unbroken length, these things become
   tedious to one who wishes to read them.

BOOK SECOND.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   How man was made holy by God, so as to be happy in the enjoyment of
   God.

   Anselm. It ought not to be disputed that rational nature was made holy
   by God, in order to be happy in enjoying Him. For to this end is it
   rational, in order to discern justice and injustice, good and evil, and
   between the greater and the lesser good. Otherwise it was made rational
   in vain. But God made it not rational in vain. Wherefore, doubtless, it
   was made rational for this end. In like manner is it proved that the
   intelligent creature received the power of discernment for this
   purpose, that he might hate and shun evil, and love and choose good,
   and especially the greater good. For else in vain would God have given
   him that power of discernment, since man's discretion would be useless
   unless he loved and avoided according to it. But it does not befit God
   to give such power in vain. It is, therefore, established that rational
   nature was created for this end, viz., to love and choose the highest
   good supremely, for its own sake and nothing else; for if the highest
   good were chosen for any other reason, then something else and not
   itself would be the thing loved. But intelligent nature cannot fulfil
   this purpose without being holy. Therefore that it might not in vain be
   made rational, it was made, in order to fulfil this purpose, both
   rational and holy. Now, if it was made holy in order to choose and love
   the highest good, then it was made such in order to follow sometimes
   what it loved and chose, or else it was not. But if it were not made
   holy for this end, that it might follow what it loves and chooses, then
   in vain was it made to love and choose holiness; and there can be no
   reason why it should be ever bound to follow holiness. Therefore, as
   long as it will be holy in loving and choosing the supreme good, for
   which it was made, it will be miserable; because it will be impotent
   despite of its will, inasmuch as it does not have what it desires. But
   this is utterly absurd. Wherefore rational nature was made holy, in
   order to be happy in enjoying the supreme good, which is God. Therefore
   man, whose nature is rational, was made holy for this end, that he
   might be happy in enjoying God.

  CHAPTER II.

   How man would never have died, unless he had sinned.

   Anselm. Moreover, it is easily proved that man was so made as not to be
   necessarily subject to death; for, as we have already said, it is
   inconsistent with God's wisdom and justice to compel man to suffer
   death without fault, when he made him holy to enjoy eternal
   blessedness. It therefore follows that had man never sinned he never
   would have died.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

   How man will rise with the same body which he has in this world.

   Anselm. From this the future resurrection of the dead is clearly
   proved. For if man is to be perfectly restored, the restoration should
   make him such as he would have been had he never sinned.

   Boso. It must be so.

   Anselm. Therefore, as man, had he not sinned, was to have been
   transferred with the same body to an immortal state, so when he shall
   be restored, it must properly be with his own body as he lived in this
   world.

   Boso. But what shall we say to one who tells us that this is right
   enough with regard to those in whom humanity shall be perfectly
   restored, but is not necessary as respects the reprobate?

   Anselm. We know of nothing more just or proper than this, that as man,
   had he continued in holiness, would have been perfectly happy for
   eternity, both in body and in soul; so, if he persevere in wickedness,
   he shall be likewise completely miserable forever.

   Boso. You have promptly satisfied me in these matters.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

   How God will complete, in respect to human nature, what he has begun.

   Anselm. From these things, we can easily see that God will either
   complete what he has begun with regard to human nature, or else he has
   made to no end so lofty a nature, capable of so great good. Now if it
   be understood that God has made nothing more valuable than rational
   existence capable of enjoying him; it is altogether foreign from his
   character to suppose that he will suffer that rational existence
   utterly to perish.

   Boso. No reasonable being can think otherwise.

   Anselm. Therefore is it necessary for him to perfect in human nature
   what he has begun. But this, as we have already said, cannot be
   accomplished save by a complete expiation of sin, which no sinner can
   effect for himself.

   Boso. I now understand it to be necessary for God to complete what he
   has begun, lest there be an unseemly falling off from his design.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

   How, although the thing may be necessary, God may not do it by a
   compulsory necessity; and what is the nature of that necessity which
   removes or lessens gratitude, and what necessity increases it.

   Boso. But if it be so, then God seems as it were compelled, for the
   sake of avoiding what is unbecoming , to secure the salvation of man.
   How, then, can it be denied that he does it more on his own account
   than on ours? But if it be so, what thanks do we owe him for what he
   does for himself? How shall we attribute our salvation to his grace, if
   he saves us from necessity?

   Anselm. There is a necessity which takes away or lessens our gratitude
   to a benefactor, and there is also a necessity by which the favor
   deserves still greater thanks. For when one does a benefit from a
   necessity to which he is unwillingly subjected, less thanks are due
   him, or none at all. But when he freely places himself under the
   necessity of benefiting another, and sustains that necessity without
   reluctance, then he certainly deserves greater thanks for the favor.
   For this should not be called necessity but grace, inasmuch as he
   undertook or maintains it, not with any constraint, but freely. For if
   that which to-day you promise of your own accord you will give
   to-morrow, you do give to-morrow with the same willingness; though it
   be necessary for you, if possible, to redeem your promise, or make
   yourself a liar; notwithstanding, the recipient of your favor is as
   much indebted for your precious gift as if you had not promised it, for
   you were not obliged to make yourself his debtor before the time of
   giving it: just so is it when one undertakes, by a vow, a design of
   holy living. For though after his vow he ought necessarily to perform,
   lest he suffer the judgment of an apostate, and, although he may be
   compelled to keep it even unwillingly, yet, if he keep his vow
   cheerfully, he is not less but more pleasing to God than if he had not
   vowed. For he has not only given up the life of the world, but also his
   personal liberty, for the sake of God; and he cannot be said to live a
   holy life of necessity, but with the same freedom with which he took
   the vow. Much more, therefore, do we owe all thanks to God for
   completing his intended favor to man; though, indeed, it would not be
   proper for him to fail in his good design, because wanting nothing in
   himself he begun it for our sake and not his own. For what man was
   about to do was not hidden from God at his creation; and yet by freely
   creating man, God as it were bound himself to complete the good which
   he had begun. In fine, God does nothing by necessity, since he is not
   compelled or restrained in anything. And when we say that God does
   anything to avoid dishonor, which he certainly does not fear, we must
   mean that God does this from the necessity of maintaining his honor;
   which necessity is after all no more than this, viz., the immutability
   of his honor, which belongs to him in himself, and is not derived from
   another; and therefore it is not properly called necessity. Yet we may
   say, although the whole work which God does for man is of grace, that
   it is necessary for God, on account of his unchangeable goodness, to
   complete the work which he has begun.

   Boso. I grant it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

   How no being, except the God-man, can make the atonement by which man
   is saved.

   Anselm. But this cannot be effected, except the price paid to God for
   the sin of man be something greater than all the universe besides God.

   Boso. So it appears.

   Anselm. Moreover, it is necessary that he who can give God anything of
   his own which is more valuable than all things in the possession of
   God, must be greater than all else but God himself.

   Boso. I cannot deny it.

   Anselm. Therefore none but God can make this satisfaction.

   Boso. So it appears.

   Anselm. But none but a man ought to do this, other wise man does not
   make the satisfaction.

   Boso. Nothing seems more just.

   Anselm. If it be necessary, therefore, as it appears, that the heavenly
   kingdom be made up of men, and this cannot be effected unless the
   aforesaid satisfaction be made, which none but God can make and none
   but man ought to make, it is necessary for the God-man to make it.

   Boso. Now blessed be God! we have made a great discovery with regard to
   our question. Go on, therefore, as you have begun. For I hope that God
   will assist you.

   Anselm. Now must we inquire how God can become man.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

   How necessary it is for the same being to be perfect God and perfect
   man.

   Anselm. The Divine and human natures cannot alternate, so that the
   Divine should become human or the human Divine; nor can they be so
   commingled as that a third should be produced from the two which is
   neither wholly Divine nor wholly human. For, granting that it were
   possible for either to be changed into the other, it would in that case
   be only God and not man, or man only and not God. Or, if they were so
   commingled that a third nature sprung from the combination of the two
   (as from two animals, a male and a female of different species, a third
   is produced, which does not preserve entire the species of either
   parent, but has a mixed nature derived from both), it would neither be
   God nor man. Therefore the God-man, whom we require to be of a nature
   both human and Divine, cannot be produced by a change from one into the
   other, nor by an imperfect commingling of both in a third; since these
   things cannot be, or, if they could be, would avail nothing to our
   purpose. Moreover, if these two complete natures are said to be joined
   somehow, in such a way that one may be Divine while the other is human,
   and yet that which is God not be the same with that which is man, it is
   impossible for both to do the work necessary to be accomplished. For
   God will not do it, because he has no debt to pay; and man will not do
   it, because he cannot. Therefore, in order that the God-man may perform
   this, it is necessary that the same being should be perfect God and
   perfect man, in order to make this atonement. For he cannot and ought
   not to do it, unless he be very God and very man. Since, then, it is
   necessary that the God-man preserve the completeness of each nature, it
   is no less necessary that these two natures be united entire in one
   person, just as a body and a reasonable soul exist together in every
   human being; for otherwise it is impossible that the same being should
   be very God and very man.

   Boso. All that you say is satisfactory to me.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

   How it behoved God to take a man of the race of Adam, and born of a
   woman.

   Anselm. It now remains to inquire whence and how God shall assume human
   nature. For he will either take it from Adam, or else he will make a
   new man, as he made Adam originally. But, if he makes a new man, not of
   Adam's race, then this man will not belong to the human family, which
   descended from Adam, and therefore ought not to make atonement for it,
   because he never belonged to it. For, as it is right for man to make
   atonement for the sin of man, it is also necessary that he who makes
   the atonement should be the very being who has sinned, or else one of
   the same race. Otherwise, neither Adam nor his race would make
   satisfaction for themselves. Therefore, as through Adam and Eve sin was
   propagated among all men, so none but themselves, or one born of them,
   ought to make atonement for the sin of men. And, since they cannot, one
   born of them must fulfil this work. Moreover, as Adam and his whole
   race, had he not sinned, would have stood firm without the support of
   any other being, so, after the fall, the same race must rise and be
   exalted by means of itself. For, whoever restores the race to its
   place, it will certainly stand by that being who has made this
   restoration. Also, when God created human nature in Adam alone, and
   would only make woman out of man, that by the union of both sexes there
   might be increase, in this he showed plainly that he wished to produce
   all that he intended with regard to human nature from man alone.
   Wherefore, if the race of Adam be reinstated by any being not of the
   same race, it will not be restored to that dignity which it would have
   had, had not Adam sinned, and so will not be completely restored; and,
   besides, God will seem to have failed of his purpose, both which
   suppositions are incongruous: It is, therefore, necessary that the man
   by whom Adam's race shall be restored be taken from Adam.

   Boso. If we follow reason, as we proposed to do, this is the necessary
   result.

   Anselm. Let us now examine the question, whether the human nature taken
   by God must be produced from a father and mother, as other men are, or
   from man alone, or from woman alone. For, in whichever of these three
   modes it be, it will be produced from Adam and Eve, for from these two
   is every person of either sex descended. And of these three modes, no
   one is easier for God than another, that it should be selected on this
   account.

   Boso. So far, it is well.

   Anselm. It is no great toil to show that that man will be brought into
   existence in a nobler and purer manner, if produced from man alone, or
   woman alone, than if springing from the union of both, as do all other
   men.

   Boso. I agree with you.

   Anselm. Therefore must he be taken either from man alone, or woman
   alone.

   Boso. There is no other source.

   Anselm. In four ways can God create man, viz., either of man and woman,
   in the common way; or neither of man nor woman, as he created Adam; or
   of man without woman, as he made Eve; or of woman without man, which
   thus far he has never done. Wherefore, in order to show that this last
   mode also under his power, and was reserved for this very purpose, what
   more fitting than that he should take that man whose origin we are
   seeking from a woman without a man? Now whether it be more worthy that
   he be born of a virgin, or one not a virgin, we need not discuss, but
   must affirm, beyond all doubt, that the God-man should be born of a
   virgin.

   Boso. Your speech gratifies my heart.

   Anselm. Does what we have said appear sound, or is it unsubstantial as
   a cloud, as you have said infidels declare?

   Boso. Nothing can be more sound.

   Anselm. Paint not, therefore, upon baseless emptiness, but upon solid
   truth, and tell how clearly fitting it is that, as man's sin and the
   cause of our condemnation sprung from a woman, so the cure of sin and
   the source of our salvation should also be found in a woman. And that
   women may not despair of attaining the inheritance of the blessed,
   because that so dire an evil arose from woman, it is proper that from
   woman also so great a blessing should arise, that their hopes may be
   revived. Take also this view. If it was a virgin which brought all evil
   upon the race, it is much more appropriate that a virgin should be the
   occasion of all good. And this also. If woman, whom God made from man
   alone, was made of a virgin (de virgine), it is peculiarly fitting for
   that man also, who shall spring from a woman, to be born of a woman
   without man. Of the pictures which can be superadded to this, showing
   that the God-man ought to be born of a virgin, we will say nothing.
   These are sufficient.

   Boso. They are certainly very beautiful and reasonable.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

   How of necessity the Word only can unite in one person with man.

   Anselm. Now must we inquire further, in what person God, who exists in
   three persons, shall take upon himself the nature of man. For a
   plurality of persons cannot take one and the same man into a unity of
   person. Wherefore in one person only can this be done. But, as respects
   this personal unity of God and man, and in which of the Divine persons
   this ought to be effected, I have expressed myself, as far as I think
   needful for the present inquiry, in a letter on the Incarnation of the
   Word, addressed to my lord, the Pope Urban.

   Boso. Yet briefly glance at this matter, why the person of the Son
   should be incarnated rather than that of the Father or the Holy Spirit.

   Anselm. If one of the other persons be incarnated, there will be two
   sons in the Trinity, viz., the Son of God, who is the Son before the
   incarnation, and he also who, by the incarnation, will be the son of
   the virgin; and among the persons which ought always to be equal there
   will be an inequality as respects the dignity of birth. For the one
   born of God will have a nobler birth than he who is born of the virgin.
   Likewise, if the Father become incarnate, there will be two grandsons
   in the Trinity; for the Father, by assuming humanity, will be the
   grandson of the parents of the virgin, and the Word, though having
   nothing to do with man, will yet be the grandson of the virgin, since
   he will be the son of her son. But all these things are incongruous and
   do not pertain to the incarnation of the Word. And there is yet another
   reason which renders it more fitting for the Son to become incarnate
   than the other persons. It is, that for the Son to pray to the Father
   is more proper than for any other person of the Trinity to supplicate
   his fellow. Moreover, man, for whom he was to pray, and the devil, whom
   he was to vanquish, have both put on a false likeness to God by their
   own will. Wherefore they have sinned, as it were, especially against
   the person of the Son, who is believed to be the very image of God.
   Wherefore the punishment or pardon of guilt is with peculiar propriety
   ascribed to him upon whom chiefly the injury was inflicted. Since,
   therefore, infallible reason has brought us to this necessary
   conclusion, that the Divine and human natures must unite in one person,
   and that this is evidently more fitting in respect to the person of the
   Word than the other persons, we determine that God the Word must unite
   with man in one person.

   Boso. The way by which you lead me is so guarded by reason that I
   cannot deviate from it to the right or left.

   Anselm. It is not I who lead you, but he of whom we are speaking,
   without whose guidance we have no power to keep the way of truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

   How this man dies not of debt; and in what sense he can or cannot sin;
   and how neither he nor an angel deserves praise for their holiness, if
   it is impossible for them to sin.

   Anselm. We ought not to question whether this man was about to die as a
   debt, as all other men do. For, if Adam would not have died had he not
   committed sin, much less should this man suffer death, in whom there
   can be no sin, for he is God.

   Boso. Let me delay you a little on this point. For in either case it is
   no slight question with me whether it be said that he can sin or that
   he cannot. For if it be said that he cannot sin, it should seem hard to
   be believed. For to say a word concerning him, not as of one who never
   existed in the manner we have spoken hitherto, but as of one whom we
   know and whose deeds we know; who, I say, will deny that he could have
   done many things which we call sinful? For, to say nothing of other
   things, how shall we say that it was not possible for him to commit the
   sin of lying? For, when he says to the Jews, of his Father: "If I say
   that I know him not, I shall be a liar, like unto you," and, in this
   sentence, makes use of the words : "I know him not," who says that he
   could not have uttered these same four words, or expressing the same
   thing differently, have declared, "I know him not?" Now had he done so,
   he would have been a liar, as he himself says, and therefore a sinner.
   Therefore, since he could do this, he could sin.

   Anselm. It is true that he could say this, and also that he could not
   sin.

   Boso. How is that?

   Anselm. All power follows the will. For, when I say that I can speak or
   walk, it is understood, if I choose. For, if the will be not implied as
   acting, there is no power, but only necessity. For, when I say that I
   can be dragged or bound unwillingly, this is not my power, but
   necessity and the power of another; since I am able to be dragged or
   bound in no other sense than this, that another can drag or bind me. So
   we can say of Christ, that he could lie, so long as we understand, if
   he chose to do so. And, since he could not lie unwillingly and could
   not wish to lie, none the less can it be said that he could not lie. So
   in this way it is both true that he could and could not lie.

   Boso. Now let us return to our original inquiry with regard to that
   man, as if nothing were known of him. I say, then, if he were unable to
   sin, because, according to you, he could not wish to sin, he maintains
   holiness of necessity, and therefore he will not be holy from free
   will. What thanks, then, will he deserve for his holiness? For we are
   accustomed to say that God made man and angel capable of sinning on
   this account, that, when of their own free will they maintained
   holiness, though they might have abandoned it, they might deserve
   commendation and reward, which they would not have done had they been
   necessarily holy.

   Anselm. Are not the angels worthy of praise, though unable to commit
   sin?

   Boso. Doubtless they are, because they deserved this present inability
   to sin from the fact that when they could sin they refused to do so.

   Anselm. What say you with respect to God, who cannot sin, and yet has
   not deserved this, by refusing to sin when he had the power? Must not
   he be praised for his holiness?

   Boso. I should like to have you answer that question for me; for if I
   say that he deserves no praise, I know that I speak falsely. If, on the
   other hand, I say that he does deserve praise, I am afraid of
   invalidating my reasoning with respect to the angels.

   Anselm. The angels are not to be praised for their holiness because
   they could sin, but because it is owing to themselves, in a certain
   sense, that now they cannot sin. And in this respect are they in a
   measure like God, who has, from himself, whatever he possesses. For a
   person is said to give a thing, who does not take it away when he can;
   and to do a thing is but the same as not to prevent it, when that is in
   one's power. When, therefore, the angel could depart from holiness and
   yet did not, and could make himself unholy yet did not, we say with
   propriety that he conferred virtue upon himself and made himself holy.
   In this sense, therefore, has he holiness of himself (for the creature
   cannot have it of himself in any other way), and, therefore, should be
   praised for his holiness, because he is not holy of necessity but
   freely; for that is improperly called necessity which involves neither
   compulsion nor restraint. Wherefore, since whatever God has he has
   perfectly of himself, he is most of all to be praised for the good
   things which he possesses and maintains not by any necessity, but, as
   before said, by his own infinite unchangeableness. Therefore, likewise,
   that man who will be also God since every good thing which he possesses
   comes from himself, will be holy not of necessity but voluntarily, and,
   therefore, will deserve praise. For, though human nature will have what
   it has from the Divine nature, yet it will likewise have it from
   itself, since the two natures will be united in one person.

   Boso. You have satisfied me on this point; and I see clearly that it is
   both true that he could not sin, and yet that he deserves praise for
   his holiness. But now I think the question arises, since God could make
   such a man, why he did not create angels and our first parents so as to
   be incapable of sin, and yet praiseworthy for their holiness?

   Anselm. Do you know what you are saying?

   Boso. I think I understand, and it is therefore I ask why he did not
   make them so.

   Anselm. Because it was neither possible nor right for any one of them
   to be the same with God, as we say that man was. And if you ask why he
   did not bring the three persons, or at least the Word, into unity with
   men at that time, I answer: Because reason did not at all demand any
   such thing then, but wholly forbade it, for God does nothing without
   reason.

   Boso. I blush to have asked the question. Go on with what you have to
   say.

   Anselm. We must conclude, then, that he should not be subject to death,
   inasmuch as he will not be a sinner.

   Boso. I must agree with you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

   How Christ dies of his own power, and how mortality does not inhere in
   the essential nature of man.

   Anselm. Now, also, it remains to inquire whether, as man's nature is,
   it is possible for that man to die?

   Boso. We need hardly dispute with regard to this, since he will be
   really man, and every man is by nature mortal.

   Anselm. I do not think mortality inheres in the essential nature of
   man, but only as corrupted. Since, had man never sinned, and had his
   immortality been unchangeably confirmed, he would have been as really
   man; and, when the dying rise again, incorruptible, they will no less
   be really men. For, if mortality was an essential attribute of human
   nature, then he who was immortal could not be man. Wherefore, neither
   corruption nor incorruption belong essentially to human nature, for
   neither makes nor destroys a man; but happiness accrues to him from the
   one, and misery from the other. But since all men die, mortality is
   included in the definition of man, as given by philosophers, for they
   have never even believed in the possibility of man's being immortal in
   all respects. And so it is not enough to prove that that man ought to
   be subject to death, for us to say that he will be in all respects a
   man.

   Boso. Seek then for some other reason, since I know of none, if you do
   not, by which we may prove that he can die.

   Anselm. We may not doubt that, as he will be God, he will possess
   omnipotence.

   Boso. Certainly.

   Anselm. He can, then, if he chooses, lay down his life and take it
   again.

   Boso. If not, he would scarcely seem to be omnipotent.

   Anselm. Therefore is he able to avoid death if he chooses, and also to
   die and rise again. Moreover, whether he lays down his life by the
   intervention of no other person, or another causes this, so that he
   lays it down by permitting it to be taken, it makes no difference as
   far as regards his power.

   Boso. There is no doubt about it.

   Anselm. If, then, he chooses to allow it, he could be slain; and if he
   were unwilling to allow it, he couId not be slain.

   Boso. To this we are unavoidably brought by reason.

   Anselm. Reason has also taught us that the gift which he presents to
   God, not of debt but freely, ought to be something greater than
   anything in the possession of God.

   Boso. Yes.

   Anselin. Now this can neither be found beneath him nor above him.

   Boso. Very true.

   Anselm. In himself, therefore, must it be found.

   Boso. So it appears.

   Anselm. Therefore will he give himself, or something pertaining to
   himself.

   Boso. I cannot see how it should be otherwise.

   Anselm. Now must we inquire what sort of a gift this should be? For he
   may not give himself to God, or anything of his, as if God did not have
   what was his own. For every creature belongs to God.

   Boso. This is so.

   Anselm. Therefore must this gift be understood in this way, that he
   somehow gives up himself, or something of his, to the honor of God,
   which he did not owe as a debtor.

   Boso. So it seems from what has been already said.

   Anselm. If we say that he will give himself to God by obedience, so as,
   by steadily maintaining holiness, to render himself subject to his
   will, this will not be giving a thing not demanded of him by God as his
   due. For every reasonable being owes his obedience to God.

   Boso. This cannot be denied.

   Anselm. Therefore must it be in some other way that he gives himself,
   or something belonging to him, to God.

   Boso. Reason urges us to this conclusion.

   Anslem. Let us see whether, perchance, this may be to give up his life
   or to lay down his life, or to deliver himself up to death for God's
   honor. For God will not demand this of him as a debt; for, as no sin
   will be found, he ought not to die, as we have already said.

   Boso. Else I cannot understand it.

   Anselm. But let us further observe whether this is according to reason.

   Boso. Speak you, and I will listen with pleasure.

   Anselm. If man sinned with ease, is it not fitting for him to atone
   with difficulty? And if he was overcome by the devil in the easiest
   manner possible, so as to dishonor God by sinning against him, is it
   not right that man, in making satisfaction for his sin, should honor
   God by conquering the devil with the greatest possible difficulty? Is
   it not proper that, since man has departed from God as far as possible
   in his sin, he should make to God the greatest possible satisfaction?

   Boso. Surely, there is nothing more reasonable.

   Anselm. Now, nothing can be more severe or difficult for man to do for
   God's honor, than to suffer death voluntarily when not bound by
   obligation; and man cannot give himself to God in any way more truly
   than by surrendering himself to death for God's honor.

   Boso. All these things are true.

   Anselm. Therefore, he who wishes to make atonement for man's sin should
   be one who can die if he chooses.

   Boso. I think it is plain that the man whom we seek for should not only
   be one who is not necessarily subject to death on account of his
   omnipotence, and one who does not deserve death on account of his sin,
   but also one who can die of his own free will, for this will be
   necessary.

   Anselm. There are also many other reasons why it is peculiarly fitting
   for that man to enter into the common intercourse of men, and maintain
   a likeness to them, only without sin. And these things are more easily
   and clearly manifest in his life and actions than they can possibly be
   shown to be by mere reason without experience. For who can say how
   necessary and wise a thing it was for him who was to redeem mankind,
   and lead them back by his teaching from the way of death and
   destruction into the path of life and eternal happiness, when he
   conversed with men, and when he taught them by personal intercourse, to
   set them an example himself of the way in which they ought to live? But
   how could he have given this example to weak and dying men, that they
   should not deviate from holiness because of injuries, or scorn, or
   tortures, or even death, had they not been able to recognise all these
   virtues in himself?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

   How, though he share in our weakness, he is not therefore miserable.

   Boso. All these things plainly show that he ought to be mortal and to
   partake of our weaknesses. But all these things are our miseries. Will
   he then be miserable?

   Anselm. No, indeed! For as no advantage which one has apart from his
   choice constitutes happiness, so there is no misery in choosing to bear
   a loss, when the choice is a wise one and made without compulsion.

   Boso. Certainly, this must be allowed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

   How, along with our other weaknesses, he does not partake of our
   ignorance.

   Boso. But tell me whether, in this likeness to men which he ought to
   have, he will inherit also our ignorance, as he does our other
   infirmities?

   Anselm. Do you doubt the omnipotence of God?

   Boso. No! but, although this man be immortal in respect to his Divine
   nature, yet will he be mortal in his human nature. For why will he not
   be like them in their ignorance, as he is in their mortality?

   Anselm. That union of humanity with the Divine person will not be
   effected except in accordance with the highest wisdom; and, therefore,
   God will not take anything belonging to man which is only useless, but
   even a hindrance to the work which that man must accomplish. For
   ignorance is in no respect useful, but very prejudicial. How can he
   perform works, so many and so great, without the highest wisdom? Or,
   how will men believe him if they find him ignorant? And if he be
   ignorant, what will it avail him? If nothing is loved except as it is
   known, and there be no good thing which he does not love, then there
   can be no good thing of which He is ignorant. But no one perfectly
   understands good, save he who can distinguish it from evil; and no one
   can make this distinction who does not know what evil is. Therefore, as
   he of whom we are speaking perfectly comprehends what is good, so there
   can be no evil with which he is unacquainted. Therefore must he have
   all knowledge, though he do not openly show it in his intercourse with
   men.

   Boso. In his more mature years, this should seem to be as you say; but,
   in infancy, as it will not be a fit time to discover wisdom, so there
   will be no need, and therefore no propriety, in his having it.

   Anselm. Did not I say that the incarnation will be made in wisdom? But
   God will in wisdom assume that mortality, which he makes use of so
   widely, because for so great an object. But he could not wisely assume
   ignorance, for this is never useful, but always injurious, except when
   an evil will is deterred from acting, on account of it. But, in him an
   evil desire never existed. For if ignorance did no harm in any other
   respect, yet does it in this, that it takes away the good of knowing.
   And to answer your question in a word: that man, from the essential
   nature of his being, will be always full of God; and, therefore, will
   never want the power, the firmness or the wisdom of God.

   Boso. Though wholly unable to doubt the truth of this with respect to
   Christ, yet, on this very account, have I asked for the reason of it.
   For we are often certain about a thing, and yet cannot prove it by
   reason.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

   How his death outweighs the number and greatness of our sins.

   Boso. Now I ask you to tell me how his death can outweigh the number
   and magnitude of our sins, when the least sin we can think of you have
   shown to be so monstrous that, were there an infinite number of worlds
   as full of created existence as this, they could not stand, but would
   fall back into nothing, sooner than one look should be made contrary to
   the just will of God.

   Anselm. Were that man here before you, and you knew who he was, and it
   were told you that, if you did not kill him, the whole universe, except
   God, would perish, would you do it to preserve the rest of creation?

   Boso. No! not even were an infinite number of worlds displayed before
   me.

   Anselm. But suppose you were told: "If you do not kill him, all the
   sins of the world will be heaped upon you."

   Boso. I should answer, that I would far rather bear all other sins, not
   only those of this world, past and future, but also all others that can
   be conceived of, than this alone. And I think I ought to say this, not
   only with regard to killing him, but even as to the slightest injury
   which could be inflicted on him.

   Anselm. You judge correctly; but tell me why it is that your heart
   recoils from one injury inflicted upon him as more heinous than all
   other sins that can be thought of, inasmuch as all sins whatsoever are
   committed against him?

   Boso. A sin committed upon his person exceeds beyond comparison all the
   sins which can be thought of, that do not affect his person.

   Anselm. What say you to this, that one often suffers freely certain
   evils in his person, in order not to suffer greater ones in his
   property?

   Boso. God has no need of such patience, for all things lie in
   subjection to his power, as you answered a certain question of mine
   above.

   Anselm. You say well; and hence we see that no enormity or multitude of
   sins, apart from the Divine person, can for a moment be compared with a
   bodily injury inflicted upon that man.

   Boso. This is most plain.

   Anselm. How great does this good seem to you, if the destruction of it
   is such an evil?

   Boso. If its existence is as great a good as its destruction is an
   evil, then is it far more a good than those sins are evils which its
   destruction so far surpasses.

   Anselm. Very true. Consider, also, that sins are as hateful as they are
   evil, and that life is only amiable in proportion as it is good. And,
   therefore, it follows that that life is more lovely than sins are
   odious.

   Boso. I cannot help seeing this.

   Anselm. And do you not think that so great a good in itself so lovely,
   can avail to pay what is due for the sins of the whole world?

   Boso. Yes! it has even infinite value.

   Anselm. Do you see, then, how this life conquers all sins, if it be
   given for them?

   Boso. Plainly.

   Anselm. If, then, to lay down life is the same as to suffer death, as
   the gift of his life surpasses all the sins of men, so will also the
   suffering of death.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

   How this death removes even the sins of his murderers.

   Boso. This is properly so with regard to all sins not affecting the
   person of the Deity. But let me ask you one thing more. If it be as
   great an evil to slay him as his life is a good, how can his death
   overcome and destroy the sins of those who slew him? Or, if it destroys
   the sin of any one of them, how can it not also destroy any sin
   committed by other men? For we believe that many men will be saved, and
   a vast many will not be saved.

   Anselm. The Apostle answers the question when he says: "Had they known
   it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory." For a sin
   knowingly committed and a sin done ignorantly are so different that an
   evil which they could never do, were its full extent known, may be
   pardonable when done in ignorance. For no man could ever, knowingly at
   least, slay the Lord; and, therefore, those who did it in ignorance did
   not rush into that transcendental crime with which none others can be
   compared. For this crime, the magnitude of which we have been
   considering as equal to the worth of his life, we have not looked at as
   having been ignorantly done, but knowingly; a thing which no man ever
   did or could do.

   Boso. You have reasonably shown that the murderers of Christ can obtain
   pardon for their sin.

   Anselm. What more do you ask? For now you see how reason of necessity
   shows that the celestial state must be made up from men, and that this
   can only be by the forgiveness of sins, which man can never have but by
   man, who must be at the same time Divine, and reconcile sinners to God
   by his own death. Therefore have we clearly found that Christ, whom we
   confess to be both God and man, died for us; and, when this is known
   beyond all doubt, all things which he says of himself must be
   acknowledged as true, for God cannot lie, and all he does must be
   received as wisely done, though we do not understand the reason of it.

   Boso. What you say is true; and I do not for a moment doubt that his
   words are true, and all that he does reasonable. But I ask this in
   order that you may disclose to me, in their true rationality, those
   things in Christian faith which seem to infidels improper or
   impossible; and this, not to strengthen me in the faith, but to gratify
   one already confirmed by the knowledge of the truth itself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

   How God took that man from a sinful substance, and yet without sin; and
   of the salvation of Adam and Eve.

   Boso. As, therefore, you have disclosed the reason of those things
   mentioned above, I beg you will also explain what I am now about to
   ask. First, then, how does God, from a sinful substance, that is, of
   human species, which was wholly tainted by sin, take, a man without
   sin, as an unleavened lump from that which is leavened? For, though the
   conception of this man be pure, and free from the sin of fleshly
   gratification, yet the virgin herself, from whom he sprang, was
   conceived in iniquity, and in sin did her mother bear her, since she
   herself sinned in Adam, in whom all men sinned.

   Anselm. Since it is fitting for that man to be God, and also the
   restorer of sinners, we doubt not that he is wholly without sin; yet
   will this avail nothing, unless he be taken without sin and yet of a
   sinful substance. But if we cannot comprehend in what manner the wisdom
   of God effects this, we should be surprised, but with reverence should
   allow of a thing of so great magnitude to remain hidden from us. For
   the restoring of human nature by God is more wonderful than its
   creation; for either was equally easy for God; but before man was made
   he had not sinned so that he ought not to be denied existence. But
   after man was made he deserved, by his sin, to lose his existence
   together with its design; though he never has wholly lost this, viz.,
   that he should be one capable of being punished, or of receiving God's
   compassion. For neither of these things could take effect if he were
   annihilated. Therefore God's restoring man is more wonderful than his
   creating man, inasmuch as it is done for the sinner contrary to his
   deserts; while the act of creation was not for the sinner, and was not
   in opposition to man's deserts. How great a thing it is, also, for God
   and man to unite in one person, that, while the perfection of each
   nature is preserved, the same being may be both God and man! Who, then,
   will dare to think that the human mind can discover how wisely, how
   wonderfully, so incomprehensible a work has been accomplished?

   Boso. I allow that no man can wholly discover so great a mystery in
   this life, and I do not desire you to do what no man can do, but only
   to explain it according to your ability. For you will sooner convince
   me that deeper reasons lie concealed in this matter, by showing some
   one that you know of, than if, by saying nothing, you make it appear
   that you do not understand any reason.

   Anselm. I see that I cannot escape your importunity; but if I have any
   power to explain what you wish, let us thank God for it. But if not,
   let the things above said suffice. For, since it is agreed that God
   ought to become man, no doubt He will not lack the wisdom or the power
   to effect this without sin.

   Boso. This I readily allow.

   Anselm. It was certainly proper that that atonement which Christ made
   should benefit not only those who lived at that time but also others.
   For, suppose there were a king against whom all the people of his
   provinces had rebelled, with but a single exception of those belonging
   to their race, and that all the rest were irretrievably under
   condemnation. And suppose that he who alone is blameless had so great
   favor with the king, and so deep love for us, as to be both able and
   willing to save all those who trusted in his guidance; and this because
   of a certain very pleasing service which he was about to do for the
   king, according to his desire; and, inasmuch as those who are to be
   pardoned cannot all assemble upon that day, the king grants, on account
   of the greatness of the service performed, that whoever, either before
   or after the day appointed, acknowledged that he wished to obtain
   pardon by the work that day accomplished, and to subscribe to the
   condition there laid down, should be freed from all past guilt; and, if
   they sinned after this pardon, and yet wished to render atonement and
   to be set right again by the efficacy of this plan, they should again
   be pardoned, only provided that no one enter his mansion until this
   thing be accomplished by which his sins are removed. In like manner,
   since all who are to be saved cannot be present at the sacrifice of
   Christ, yet such virtue is there in his death that its power is
   extended even to those far remote in place or time. But that it ought
   to benefit not merely those present is plainly evident, because there
   could not be so many living at the time of his death as are necessary
   to complete the heavenly state, even if all who were upon the earth at
   that time were admitted to the benefits of redemption. For the number
   of evil angels which must be made up from men is greater than the
   number of men at that time living. Nor may we believe that, since man
   was created, there was ever a time when the world, with the creatures
   made for the use of man, was so unprofitable as to contain no human
   being who had gained the object for which he was made. For it seems
   unfitting that God should even for a moment allow the human race, made
   to complete the heavenly state, and those creatures which he made for
   their use, to exist in vain.

   Boso. You show by correct reasoning, such as nothing can oppose, that
   there never was a time since man was created when there has not been
   some one who was gaining that reconciliation without which every man
   was made in vain. So that we rest upon this as not only proper but also
   necessary. For if this is more fit and reasonable than that at any time
   there should be no one found fulfilling the design for which God made
   man, and there is no further objection that can be made to this view,
   then it is necessary that there always be some person partaking of this
   promised pardon. And, therefore, we must not doubt that Adam and Eve
   obtained part in that forgiveness, though Divine authority makes no
   mention of this.

   Anselm. It is also incredible that God created them, and unchangeably
   determined to make all men from them, as many as were needed for the
   celestial state, and yet should exclude these two from this design.

   Boso. Nay, undoubtedly we ought to believe that God made them for this
   purpose, viz., to belong to the number of those for whose sake they
   were created.

   Anselm. You understand it well. But no soul, before the death of
   Christ, could enter the heavenly kingdom, as I said above, with regard
   to the palace of the king.

   Boso. So we believe.

   Anselm. Moreover, the virgin, from whom that man was taken of whom we
   are speaking, was of the number of those who were cleansed from their
   sins before his birth, and he was born of her in her purity.

   Boso. What you say would satisfy me, were it not that he ought to be
   pure of himself, whereas he appears to have his purity from his mother
   and not from himself.

   Anselm. Not so. But as the mother's purity, which he partakes, was only
   derived from him, he also was pure by and of himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

   How he did not die of necessity, though he could not be born, except as
   destined to suffer death.

   Boso. Thus far it is well. But there is yet another matter that needs
   to be looked into. For we have said before that his death was not to be
   a matter of necessity; yet now we see that his mother was purified by
   the power of his death, when without this he could not have been born
   of her. How, then, was not his death necessary, when he could not have
   been, except in view of future death? For if he were not to die, the
   virgin of whom he was born could not be pure, since this could only be
   effected by true faith in his death, and, if she were not pure, he
   could not be born of her. If, therefore, his death be not a necessary
   consequence of his being born of the virgin, he never could have been
   born of her at all; but this is an absurdity.

   Anselm. If you had carefully noted the remarks made above, you would
   easily have discovered in them, I think, the answer to your question.

   Boso. I see not how.

   Anselm. Did we not find, when considering the question whether he would
   lie, that there were two senses of the word power in regard to it, the
   one referring to his disposition, the other to the act itself; and
   that, though having the power to lie, he was so constituted by nature
   as not to wish to lie, and, therefore, deserved praise for his holiness
   in maintaining the truth?

   Boso. It is so.

   Anselm. In like manner, with regard to the preservation of his life,
   there is the power of preserving and the power of wishing to preserve
   it. And when the question is asked whether the same God-man could
   preserve his life, so as never to die, we must not doubt that he always
   had the power to preserve his life, though he could not wish to do so
   for the purpose of escaping death. And since this disposition, which
   forever prevents him from wishing this, arises from himself, he lays
   down his life not of necessity, but of free authority.

   Boso. But those powers were not in all respects similar, the power to
   lie and the power to preserve his life. For, if he wished to lie, he
   would of course be able to; but, if he wished to avoid the other, he
   could no more do it than he could avoid being what he is. For he became
   man for this purpose, and it was on the faith of his coming death that
   he could receive birth from a virgin, as you said above.

   Anselm. As you think that he could not lie, or that his death was
   necessary, because be could not avoid being what he was, so you can
   assert that he could not wish to avoid death, or that he wished to die
   of necessity, because he could not change the constitution of his
   being; for he did not become man in order that he should die, any more
   than for this purpose, that he should wish to die. Wherefore, as you
   ought not to say that he could not help wishing to die, or that it was
   of necessity that he wished to die, it is equally improper to say that
   he could not avoid death, or that he died of necessity.

   Boso. Yes, since dying and wishing to die are included in the same mode
   of reasoning, both would seem to fall under a like necessity.

   Anselm. Who freely wished to become man, that by the same unchanging
   desire he should suffer death, and that the virgin from whom that man
   should be born might be pure, through confidence in the certainty of
   this?

   Boso. God, the Son of God.

   Anselm. Was it not above shown, that no desire of God is at all
   constrained; but that it freely maintains itself in his own
   unchangeableness, as often as it is said that he does anything
   necessarily?

   Boso. It has been clearly shown. But we see, on the other hand, that
   what God unchangeably wishes cannot avoid being so, but takes place of
   necessity. Wherefore, if God wished that man to die, he could but die.

   Anselm. Because the Son of God took the nature of man with this desire,
   viz., that he should suffer death, you prove it necessary that this man
   should not be able to avoid death.

   Boso. So I perceive.

   Anselm. Has it not in like manner appeared from the things which we
   have spoken that the Son of God and the man whose person he took were
   so united that the same being should be both God and man, the Son of
   God and the son of the virgin?

   Boso. It is so.

   Anselm. Therefore the same man could possibly both die and avoid death.

   Boso. I cannot deny it.

   Anselm. Since, then, the will of God does nothing by any necessity, but
   of his own power, and the will of that man was the same as the will of
   God, he died not necessarily, but only of his own power.

   Boso. To your arguments I cannot object; for neither your propositions
   nor your inferences can I invalidate in the least. But yet this thing
   which I have mentioned always recurs to my mind: that, if he wished to
   avoid death, he could no more do it than he could escape existence. For
   it must have been fixed that he was to die, for had it not been true
   that he was about to die, faith in his coming death would not have
   existed, by which the virgin who gave him birth and many others also
   were cleansed from their sin. Wherefore, if he could avoid death, he
   could make untrue what was true.

   Anselm. Why was it true, before he died, that he was certainly to die?

   Boso. Because this was his free and unchangeable desire.

   Anselm. If, then, as you say, he could not avoid death because he was
   certainly to die, and was on this account certainly to die because it
   was his free and unchangeable desire, it is clear that his inability to
   avoid death is nothing else but his fixed choice to die.

   Boso. This is so; but whatever be the reason, it still remains certain
   that he could not avoid death, but that it was a necessary thing for
   him to die.

   Anselm. You make a great ado about nothing, or, as the saying is, you
   stumble at a straw.

   Boso. Are you not forgetting my reply to the excuses you made at the
   beginning of our discussion, viz., that you should explain the subject,
   not as to learned men, but to me and my fellow inquirers? Suffer me,
   then, to question you as my slowness and dullness require, so that, as
   you have begun thus far, you may go on to settle all our childish
   doubts.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII (a). [11]

   How, with God there is neither necessity nor impossibility, and what is
   a coercive necessity, and what one that is not so.

   Anselm. We have already said that it is improper to affirm of God that
   he does anything, or that he cannot do it, of necessity. For all
   necessity and impossibility is under his control. But his choice is
   subject to no necessity nor impossibility. For nothing is necessary or
   impossible save as He wishes it. Nay, the very choosing or refusing
   anything as a necessity or an impossibility is contrary to truth.
   Since, then, he does what he chooses and nothing else, as no necessity
   or impossibility exists before his choice or refusal, so neither do
   they interfere with his acting or not acting, though it be true that
   his choice and action are immutable. And as, when God does a thing,
   since it has been done it cannot be undone, but must remain an actual
   fact; still, we are not correct in saying that it is impossible for God
   to prevent a past action from being what it is. For there is no
   necessity or impossibility in the case whatever but the simple will of
   God, which chooses that truth should be eternally the same, for he
   himself is truth. Also, if he has a fixed determination to do anything,
   though his design must be destined to an accomplishment before it comes
   to pass, yet there is no coercion as far as he is concerned, either to
   do it or not to do it, for his will is the sole agent in the case. For
   when we say that God cannot do a thing, we do not deny his power; on
   the contrary, we imply that he has invincible authority and strength.
   For we mean simply this, that nothing can compel God to do the thing
   which is said to be impossible for him. We often use an expression of
   this kind, that a thing can be when the power is not in itself, but in
   something else; and that it cannot be when the weakness does not
   pertain to the thing itself, but to something else. Thus we say "Such a
   man can be bound," instead of saying, "Somebody can bind him," and, "He
   cannot be bound," instead of, "Nobody can bind him." For to be able to
   be overcome is not power but weakness, and not to be able to be
   overcome is not weakness but power. Nor do we say that God does
   anything by necessity, because there is any such thing pertaining to
   him, but because it exists in something else, precisely as I said with
   regard to the affirmation that he cannot do anything. For necessity is
   always either compulsion or restraint; and these two kinds of necessity
   operate variously by turn, so that the same thing is both necessary and
   impossible. For whatever is obliged to exist is also prevented from
   non-existence; and that which is compelled not to exist is prevented
   from existence. So that whatever exists from necessity cannot avoid
   existence, and it is impossible for a thing to exist which is under a
   necessity of nonexistence, and vice versa. But when we say with regard
   to God, that anything is necessary or not necessary, we do not mean
   that, as far as he is concerned, there is any necessity either coercive
   or prohibitory, but we mean that there is a necessity in everything
   else, restraining or driving them in a particular way. Whereas we say
   the very opposite of God. For, when we affirm that it is necessary for
   God to utter truth, and never to lie, we only mean that such is his
   unwavering disposition to maintain the truth that of necessity nothing
   can avail to make him deviate from the truth, or utter a lie. When,
   then, we say that that man (who, by the union of persons, is also God,
   the Son of God) could not avoid death, or the choice of death, after he
   was born of the virgin, we do not imply that there was in him any
   weakness with regard to preserving or choosing to preserve his life,
   but we refer to the unchangeableness of his purpose, by which he freely
   became man for this design, viz., that by persevering in his wish he
   should suffer death. And this desire nothing could shake. For it would
   be rather weakness than power if he could wish to lie, or deceive, or
   change his disposition, when before he had chosen that it should remain
   unchanged. And, as I said before, when one has freely determined to do
   some good action, and afterwards goes on to complete it, though, if
   unwilling to pay his vow, he could be compelled to do so, yet we must
   not say that he does it of necessity, but with the same freedom with
   which he made the resolution. For we ought not to say that anything is
   done, or not done, by necessity or weakness, when free choice is the
   only agent in the case. And, if this is so with regard to man, much
   less can we speak of necessity or weakness in reference to God; for he
   does nothing except according to his choice, and his will no force can
   drive or restrain. For this end was accomplished by the united natures
   of Christ, viz., that the Divine nature should perform that part of the
   work needful for man's restoration which the human nature could not do;
   and that in the human should be manifested what was inappropriate to
   the Divine. Finally, the virgin herself, who was made pure by faith in
   him, so that he might be born of her, even she, I say, never believed
   that he was to die, save of his own choice. For she knew the words of
   the prophet, who said of him: "He was offered of his own will."
   Therefore, since her faith was well founded, it must necessarily turn
   out as she believed. And, if it perplexes you to have me say that it is
   necessary, remember that the reality of the virgin's faith was not the
   cause of his dying by his own free will; but, because this was destined
   to take place, therefore her faith was real. If, then, it be said that
   it was necessary for him to die of his single choice, because the
   antecedent faith and prophecy were true, this is no more than saying
   that it must be because it was to be. But such a necessity as this does
   not compel a thing to be, but only implies a necessity of its
   existence. There is an antecedent necessity which is the cause of a
   thing, and there is also a subsequent necessity arising from the thing
   itself. Thus, when the heavens are said to revolve, it is an antecedent
   and efficient necessity, for they must revolve. But when I say that you
   speak of necessity, because you are speaking, this is nothing but a
   subsequent and inoperative necessity. For I only mean that it is
   impossible for you to speak and not to speak at the same time, and not
   that some one compels you to speak. For the force of its own nature
   makes the heaven revolve; but no necessity obliges you to speak. But
   wherever there is an antecedent necessity, there is also a subsequent
   one; but not vice versa. For we can say that the heaven revolves of
   necessity, because it revolves; but it is not likewise true that,
   because you speak, you do it of necessity. This subsequent necessity
   pertains to everything, so that we say: Whatever has been, necessarily
   has been. Whatever is, must be. Whatever is to be, of necessity will
   be. This is that necessity which Aristotle treats of ("de
   propositionibus singularibus et futuris"), and which seems to destroy
   any alternative and to ascribe a necessity to all things. By this
   subsequent and imperative necessity, was it necessary (since the belief
   and prophecy concerning Christ were true, that he would die of his own
   free will), that it should be so. For this he became man; for this he
   did and suffered all things undertaken by him; for this he chose as he
   did. For therefore were they necessary, because they were to be, and
   they were to be because they were, and they were because they were;
   and, if you wish to know the real necessity of all things which he did
   and suffered, know that they were of necessity, because he wished them
   to be. But no necessity preceded his will. Wherefore if they were not
   save by his will, then, had he not willed they would not have existed.
   So then, no one took his life from him, but he laid it down of himself
   and took it again; for he had power to lay it down and to take it
   again, as he himself said.

   Boso. You have satisfied me that it cannot be proved that he was
   subjected to death by any necessity ; and I cannot regret my
   importunity in urging you to make this explanation.

   Anselm. I think we have shown with sufficient clearness how it was that
   God took a man without sin from a sinful substance; but I would on no
   account deny that there is no other explanation than this which we have
   given, for God can certainly do what human reason cannot grasp. But
   since this appears adequate, and since in search of other arguments we
   should involve ourselves in such questions as that of original sin, and
   how it was transmitted by our first parents to all mankind, except this
   man of whom we are speaking; and since, also, we should be drawn into
   various other questions, each demanding its own separate consideration;
   let us be satisfied with this account of the matter, and go on to
   complete our intended work.

   Boso. As you choose; but with this condition that, by the help of God,
   you will sometime give this other explanation, which you owe me, as it
   were, but which now you avoid discussing.

   Anselm. Inasmuch as I entertain this desire myself, I will not refuse
   you; but because of the uncertainty of future events, I dare not
   promise you, but commend it to the will of God. But say now, what
   remains to be unravelled with regard to the question which you proposed
   in the first place, and which involves many others with it?

   Boso. The substance of the inquiry was this, why God became man, for
   the purpose of saving men by his death, when he could have done it in
   some other way. And you, by numerous and positive reasons, have shown
   that the restoring of mankind ought not to take place, and could not,
   without man paid the debt which he owed God for his sin. And this debt
   was so great that, while none but man must solve the debt, none but God
   was able to do it; so that he who does it must be both God and man. And
   hence arises a necessity that God should take man into unity with his
   own person; so that he who in his own nature was bound to pay the debt,
   but could not, might be able to do it in the person of God. In fine,
   you have shown that that man, who was also God, must be formed from the
   virgin, and from the person of the Son of God, and that he could be
   taken without sin, though from a sinful substance. Moreover, you have
   clearly shown the life of this man to have been so excellent and so
   glorious as to make ample satisfaction for the sins of the whole world,
   and even infinitely more. It now, therefore, remains to be shown how
   that payment is made to God for the sins of men.

  CHAPTER XVIII (b.)

   How Christ's life is paid to God for the sins of men, and in what sense
   Christ ought, and in what sense he ought not, or was not bound, to
   suffer.

   Anselm. If he allowed himself to be slain for the sake of justice, he
   did not give his life for the honor of God?

   Boso. It should seem so, but I cannot understand, although I do not
   doubt it, how he could do this reasonably. If I saw how he could be
   perfectly holy, and yet forever preserve his life, I would acknowledge
   that he freely gave, for the honor of God, such a gift as surpasses all
   things else but God himself, and is able to atone for all the sins of
   men.

   Anselm. Do you not perceive that when he bore with gentle patience the
   insults put upon him, violence and even crucifixion among thieves that
   he might maintain strict holiness; by this he set men an example that
   they should never turn aside from the holiness due to God on account of
   personal sacrifice? But how could he have done this, had he, as he
   might have done, avoided the death brought upon him for such a reason?

   Boso. But surely there was no need of this, for many persons before his
   coming, and John the Baptist after his coming but before his death, had
   sufficiently enforced this example by nobly dying for the sake of the
   truth.

   Anselm. No man except this one ever gave to God what he was not obliged
   to lose, or paid a debt he did not owe. But he freely offered to the
   Father what there was no need of his ever losing, and paid for sinners
   what he owed not for himself. Therefore he set a much nobler example,
   that each one should not hesitate to give to God, for himself, what he
   must at any rate lose before long, since it was the voice of reason;
   for he, when not in want of anything for himself and not compelled by
   others, who deserved nothing of him but punishment, gave so precious a
   life, even the life of so illustrious a personage, with such
   willingness.

   Boso. You very nearly meet my wishes; but suffer me to make one
   inquiry, which you may think foolish, but which, nevertheless, I find
   no easy thing to answer. You say that when he died he gave what he did
   not owe. But no one will deny that it was better for him, or that so
   doing he pleased God more than if he had not done it. Nor will any one
   say that he was not bound to do what was best to be done, and what he
   knew would be more pleasing to God. How then can we affirm that he did
   not owe God the thing which he did, that is, the thing which he knew to
   be best and most pleasing to God, and especially since every creature
   owes God all that he is and all that he knows and all that he is
   capable of?

   Anselm. Though the creature has nothing of himself, yet when God grants
   him the liberty of doing or not doing a thing, he leaves the
   alternative with him, so that, though one is better than the other, yet
   neither is positively demanded. And, whichever he does, it may be said
   that he ought to do it; and if he takes the better choice, he deserves
   a reward; because he renders freely what is his own. For, though
   celibacy be better than marriage, yet neither is absolutely enjoined
   upon man; so that both he who chooses marriage and he who prefers
   celibacy, may be said to do as they ought. For no one says that either
   celibacy or marriage ought not to be chosen; but we say that what a man
   esteems best before taking action upon any of these things, this he
   ought to do. And if a man preserves his celibacy as a free gift offered
   to God, he looks for a reward. When you say that the creature owes God
   what he knows to be the better choice, and what he is able to do, if
   you mean that he owes it as a debt, without implying any command on the
   part of God, it is not always true. Thus, as I have already said, a man
   is not bound to celibacy as a debt, but ought to marry if he prefers
   it. And if you are unable to understand the use of this word "debere,"
   when no debt is implied, let me inform you that we use the word
   "debere" precisely as we sometimes do the words "posse, " and "non
   posse, " and also "necessitas," when the ability, etc., is not in the
   things themselves, but in something else. When, for instance, we say
   that the poor ought to receive alms from the rich, we mean that the
   rich ought to bestow alms upon the poor. For this is a debt not owed by
   the poor but by the rich. We also say that God ought to be exalted over
   all, not because there is any obligation resting upon him, but because
   all things ought to be subject to him. And he wishes that all creatures
   should be what they ought; for what God wishes to be ought to be. And,
   in like manner, when any creature wishes to do a thing that is left
   entirely at his own disposal, we say that he ought to do it, for what
   he wishes to be ought to be. So our Lord Jesus, when he wished, as we
   have said, to suffer death, ought to have done precisely what he did;
   because he ought to be what he wished, and was not bound to do anything
   as a debt. As he is both God and man, in connection with his human
   nature, which made him a man, he must also have received from the
   Divine nature that control over himself which freed him from all
   obligation, except to do as he chose. In like manner, as one person of
   the Trinity, he must have had whatever he possessed of his own right,
   so as to be complete in himself, and could not have been under
   obligations to another, nor have need of giving anything in order to be
   repaid himself.

   Boso. Now I see clearly that he did not give himself up to die for the
   honor of God, as a debt; for this my own reason proves, and yet he
   ought to have done what he did.

   Anselm. That honor certainly belongs to the whole Trinity; and, since
   he is very God, the Son of God, he offered himself for his own honor,
   as well as for that of the Father and the Holy Spirit; that is, he gave
   his humanity to his divinity, which is one person of the Triune God.
   But, though we express our idea more definitely by clinging to the
   precise truth, yet we may say, according to our custom, that the Son
   freely gave himself to the Father. For thus we plainly affirm that in
   speaking of one person we understand the whole Deity, to whom as man he
   offered himself. And, by the names of Father and Son, a wondrous depth
   of devotion is excited in the hearts of the hearers, when it is said
   that the Son supplicates the Father on our behalf.

   Boso. This I readily acknowledge.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

   How human salvation follows upon his death.

   Anselm. Let us now observe, if we can, how the salvation of men rests
   on this.

   Boso. This is the very wish of my heart. For, although I think I
   understand you, yet I wish to get from you the close chain of argument.

   Anselm. There is no need of explaining how precious was the gift which
   the Son freely gave.

   Boso. That is clear enough already.

   Anselm. But you surely will not think that he deserves no reward, who
   freely gave so great a gift to God.

   Boso. I see that it is necessary for the Father to reward the Son; else
   he is either unjust in not wishing to do it, or weak in not being able
   to do it; but neither of these things can be attributed to God.

   Anselm. He who rewards another either gives him something which he does
   not have, or else remits some rightful claim upon him. But anterior to
   the great offering of the Son, all things belonging to the Father were
   his, nor did he ever owe anything which could be forgiven him. How then
   can a reward be bestowed on one who needs nothing, and to whom no gift
   or release can be made?

   Boso. I see on the one hand a necessity for a reward, and on the other
   it appears impossible; for God must necessarily render payment for what
   he owes, and yet there is no one to receive it.

   Anselm. But if a reward so large and so deserved is not given to him or
   any one else, then it will almost appear as if the Son had done this
   great work in vain.

   Boso. Such a supposition is impious.

   Anselm. The reward then must be bestowed upon some one else, for it
   cannot be upon him.

   Boso. This is necessarily so.

   Anselm. Had the Son wished to give some one else what was due to him,
   could the Father rightfully prevent it, or refuse to give it to the
   other person?

   Boso. No! but I think it would be both just and necessary that the gift
   should be given by the Father to whomsoever the Son wished; because the
   Son should be allowed to give away what is his own, and the Father
   cannot bestow it at all except upon some other person.

   Anselm. Upon whom would he more properly bestow the reward accruing
   from his death, than upon those for whose salvation, as right reason
   teaches, he became man; and for whose sake, as we have already said, he
   left an example of suffering death to preserve holiness? For surely in
   vain will men imitate him, if they be not also partakers of his reward.
   Or whom could he more justly make heirs of the inheritance, which he
   does not need, and of the superfluity of his possessions, than his
   parents and brethren? What more proper than that, when he beholds so
   many of them weighed down by so heavy a debt, and wasting through
   poverty, in the depth of their miseries, he should remit the debt
   incurred by their sins, and give them what their transgressions had
   forfeited?

   Boso. The universe can hear of nothing more reasonable, more sweet,
   more desirable. And I receive such confidence from this that I cannot
   describe the joy with which my heart exults. For it seems to me that
   God can reject none who come to him in his name.

   Anselm. Certainly not, if he come aright. And the Scriptures, which
   rest on solid truth as on a firm foundation, and which, by the help of
   God, we have somewhat examined,--the Scriptures, I say, show us how to
   approach in order to share such favor, and how we ought to live under
   it.

   Boso. And whatever is built on this foundation is founded on an
   immovable rock.

   Anselm. I think I have nearly enough answered your inquiry, though I
   might do it still more fully, and there are doubtless many reasons
   which are beyond me and which mortal ken does not reach. It is also
   plain that God had no need of doing the thing spoken of, but eternal
   truth demanded it. For though God is said to have done what that man
   did, on account of the personal union made; yet God was in no need of
   descending from heaven to conquer the devil, nor of contending against
   him in holiness to free mankind. But God demanded that man should
   conquer the devil, so that he who had offended by sin should atone by
   holiness. As God owed nothing to the devil but punishment, so man must
   only make amends by conquering the devil as man had already been
   conquered by him. But whatever was demanded of man, he owed to God and
   not to the devil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XX.

   How great and how just is God's compassion.

   NOW we have found the compassion of God which appeared lost to you when
   we were considering God's holiness and man's sin; we have found it, I
   say, so great and so consistent with his holiness, as to be
   incomparably above anything that can be conceived. For what compassion
   can excel these words of the Father, addressed to the sinner doomed to
   eternal torments and having no way of escape: "Take my only begotten
   Son and make him an offering for yourself;" or these words of the Son:
   "Take me, and ransom your souls." For these are the voices they utter,
   when inviting and leading us to faith in the Gospel. Or can anything be
   more just than for him to remit all debt since he has earned a reward
   greater than all debt, if given with the love which he deserves.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

   How it is impossible for the devil to be reconciled.

   IF you carefully consider the scheme of human salvation, you will
   perceive the reconciliation of the devil, of which you made inquiry, to
   be impossible. For, as man could not be reconciled but by the death of
   the God-man, by whose holiness the loss occasioned by man's sin should
   be made up; so fallen angels cannot be saved but by the death of a
   God-angel who by his holiness may repair the evil occasioned by the
   sins of his companions. And as man must not be restored by a man of a
   different race, though of the same nature, so no angel ought to be
   saved by any other angel, though all were of the same nature, for they
   are not like men, all of the same race. For all angels were not sprung
   from one, as all men were. And there is another objection to their
   restoration, viz , that, as they fell with none to plot their fall, so
   they must rise with none to aid them; but this is impossible. But
   otherwise they cannot be restored to their original dignity. For, had
   they not sinned, they would have been confirmed in virtue without any
   foreign aid, simply by the power given to them from the first. And,
   therefore, if any one thinks that the redemption of our Lord ought to
   be extended even to the fallen angels, he is convinced by reason, for
   by reason he has been deceived. And I do not say this as if to deny
   that the virtue of his death far exceeds all the sins of men and
   angels, but because infallible reason rejects the reconciliation of the
   fallen angels.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

   How the truth of the Old and New Testament is shown in the things which
   have been said.

   Boso. All things which you have said seem to me reasonable and
   incontrovertible. And by the solution of the single question proposed
   do I see the truth of all that is contained in the Old and New
   Testament. For, in proving that God became man by necessity, leaving
   out what was taken from the Bible, viz., the remarks on the persons of
   the Trinity, and on Adam, you convince both Jews and Pagans by the mere
   force of reason. And the God-man himself originates the New Testament
   and approves the Old. And, as we must acknowledge him to be true, so no
   one can dissent from anything contained in these books.

   Anselm. If we have said anything that needs correction, I am willing to
   make the correction if it be a reasonable one. But, if the conclusions
   which we have arrived at by reason seem confirmed by the testimony of
   the truth, then ought we to attribute it, not to ourselves, but to God,
   who is blessed forever.--

   Amen.
